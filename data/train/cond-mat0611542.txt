    "what causes magnetic hysteresis and how is it induced and influenced by coexisting microscopic disorder ? this is the question that we address and provide new answers about in this paper .",
    "we are able to provide new information about this venerable old question because we have developed a new way to directly probe the effect of disorder on the spatial structure of the microscopic magnetic domain configuration as a function of the applied magnetic field history .",
    "when we finished our experimental study , we discovered that our results could not be explained by any existing microscopic theories of magnetic hysteresis .",
    "so we developed several viable theoretical models . in this paper , we present our detailed experimental results and the theoretical models that we developed to explain them .",
    "magnetic hysteresis is fundamental to all magnetic storage technologies and consequently is a cornerstone of the present information age .",
    "the magnetic recording industry deliberately introduces carefully controlled disorder into its materials to obtain the desired hysteretic behavior and magnetic properties . over the past 40 years",
    ", such magnetic hardening has developed into a high art form . however , despite decades of intense study and significant recent advances , we still do not have a completely satisfactory microscopic understanding of magnetic hysteresis .",
    "the exponential growth of computing power that fueled the information age has been driven by two technological revolutions : 1 ) the integrated circuit revolution and its exponential growth described by moore s law .",
    "2 ) the magnetic disk drive revolution and its exponential growth which for the past decade has surpassed moore s law . both of these mature technologies are rapidly approaching their fundamental physical limits .",
    "if the incredible growth rate of storage capacity in magnetic media is to continue , new advances in our fundamental understanding of magnetic hysteresis are needed .    for the past 20 years",
    ", magnetic films with perpendicular anisotropy have been extensively studied for their potential to extend the limits of storage capacity .",
    "early in 2005 , the first commercial disk drives using perpendicular magnetic media became available .",
    "the system that we study here is a model for these new perpendicular magnetic media . in this paper",
    ", we present our results on the effect of disorder on the correlations between the domain configurations in these systems .    to study the detailed evolution of the magnetic domain configuration correlations in our samples , we developed a new x - ray scattering technique , coherent x - ray speckle metrology ( cxsm ) .",
    "we illuminate our samples with coherent x - rays tuned to excite virtual 2p to 3d resonant transitions in cobalt .",
    "the resulting resonant excitation of the cobalt provides our magnetic signal .",
    "the coherence of the x - rays produces a magnetic x - ray speckle pattern . the positions and",
    "intensity of the speckles provides a detailed fingerprint of the microscopic magnetic domain configuration .",
    "changes in the magnetic domain configuration produce changes in the speckle pattern .",
    "so by comparing these magnetic fingerprints versus the magnetic field history  by cross - correlating speckle patterns with different magnetic field histories",
    " we obtain a quantitative measure of the applied field - history - induced evolution of the magnetic domain configuration .    here",
    "we report our results obtained by applying cxsm to investigate the effects of controlled disorder on the magnetic domain evolution in a series of co / pt multilayer samples with perpendicular anisotropy .",
    "we introduced disorder into the samples by systematically increasing the interfacial roughness of the co / pt multilayers during the growth process .",
    "we found that this disorder induces memory in the microscopic magnetic domain configurations from one cycle of the hysteresis loop to the next , despite taking the samples through magnetic saturation .",
    "our lowest disorder samples have no detectable cycle - to - cycle memory ; their domain patterns are unique each time the sample is cycled around the major loop .",
    "as we increase the disorder , the cycle - to - cycle memory develops and grows to a maximum value , but never becomes perfect or complete at room temperature .    in this paper",
    ", we only present our results for microscopic magnetic memory along the major loop in the slow field sweep limit . in this limit",
    ", the measured hysteresis loop is the same over many decades of sweep rate .",
    "the hysteresis in this limit is often called rate - independent hysteresis , or quasi - static hysteresis . there are , of course , also interesting and important hysteresis effects that occur at high sweep rates .",
    "our strategy was to study the simpler rate - independent hysteresis case before adding the additional physics , and complications , associated with high sweep rates .",
    "as we explain below , the disorder dependence of the rate - independent hysteresis in our system turned out to be remarkably rich and interesting .",
    "we do not discuss our results for rate - independent minor loop memory in this paper , but we briefly reported them recently @xcite .",
    "the best modern microscopic disorder - based theories of magnetic hysteresis were built on the foundations of barkhausen noise measurements @xcite . even in the rate - independent limit , the magnetization of a disordered ferromagnet does not change smoothly as the applied field is swept up and down . instead , there are magnetic domain avalanches that produce magnetization jumps .",
    "these avalanches exhibit power - law size distributions indicating that many different size regions change their magnetization in jumps as the field is swept around the major hysteresis loop .    a comprehensive , recent review of barkhausen noise studies  including a translation of barkhausen s 1919 paper  is given in ref . @xcite .",
    "for some materials in the rate - independent limit , the barkhausen noise is independent of the magnetic sweep rate ; these avalanches occur at fixed values of the applied field , independent of the sweep rate @xcite .",
    "barkhausen measurements provide exquisite information about the time structure of the avalanches , but they usually do not provide any spatial information about the location of the avalanches . because we directly measure the nanometer scale spatial structure of the magnetic domain configuration changes , we obtain detailed information about the configuration evolution that can not be obtained directly from the best classical barkhausen noise studies or from their modern optical implementations @xcite . because there has been extensive theoretical work on barkhausen noise , the corresponding field - history - dependent microscopic morphologies of the magnetic domain configurations have been indirectly inferred from the barkhausen time - signals via detailed computer simulations .",
    "for example , sethna , dahmen and their co - workers have shown that the morphology for their random field ising model ( rfim ) is fractal in space .",
    "they provide a comprehensive review of their work in ref .",
    "@xcite .    taken together ,",
    "the detailed fractal - in - time structure measured via the barkhausen noise , and the extensive computer simulations by sethna , dahmen , and others , imply that their magnetic domain configurations are fractal in space . therefore , why not simply measure the correlations between the magnetic domain configurations directly ? that is precisely what we do in this paper .",
    "there has been very little systematic , ensemble - level experimental work on the spatial evolution of the magnetic domain configurations @xcite , but this information is readily available from the existing simulations .",
    "however , up until now almost all of the work has been done for pure rfims .",
    "our experimental system and the new generation of perpendicular magnetic disk drive media have long - range dipole interactions .",
    "this means that new theories that include the dipolar interactions@xcite will be required to understand these materials .    during our work",
    ", we unearthed three interesting aspects of our magnetic domain wall evolution .",
    "the first , called major loop return - point memory ( rpm ) , describes the magnetization for each point on the major loop .",
    "if this magnetization is precisely the same for each cycle around the major loop , then we have macroscopic major loop rpm .",
    "if , in addition , the microscopic magnetic domain configuration is also identical , then we have microscopic major loop rpm .",
    "our experiments show that our samples have perfect macroscopic major loop rpm , but imperfect microscopic major loop rpm at room temperature .",
    "the second , called complementary - point memory ( cpm ) , describes the inversion symmetry of the major loop through the origin .",
    "if the magnetization at field @xmath0 on the descending branch is equal to the minus the magnetization at field @xmath1 on the ascending branch , then we have perfect macroscopic major loop cpm . if , in addition , the magnetic domains are precisely reversed , then we have perfect microscopic major loop cpm .",
    "our experiments show that our samples have perfect macroscopic major loop cpm , but imperfect microscopic major loop cpm at room temperature .",
    "in addition , we find that our measured values for the microscopic rpm are consistently a little larger than those for our microscopic cpm  thus the rpm - cpm symmetry is slightly broken .",
    "the third , called half - loop - memory(hlm ) , describes the degree of change in the magnetic domain configurations along a single branch of the major hysteresis loop .",
    "our experiments show that disorder has a direct effect on how the domains evolve .",
    "the greater the disorder present in the sample , then the greater the observed changes in the domain configurations as the applied field is slowly adjusted to take the system along the major hysteresis loop .",
    "our measured values for the hlm are consistently higher in the low disorder samples than those present in the disordered samples .    we were inspired to do our experimental study by the beautiful work on the rfim by sethna , dahmen , and coworkers @xcite .",
    "we were therefore very surprised to discover that their model could not describe our experimental results .",
    "their pure zero - temperature rfim predicts perfect macroscopic and microscopic major loop rpm , but it does not agree with our experiments because it predicts essentially no microscopic major loop cpm .",
    "it seems reasonable that their @xmath2 rfim will predict perfect macroscopic rpm but imperfect microscopic rpm like that observed in our experiments , but this has not been tested .",
    "however their model can not predict our observed microscopic cpm and therefore it also can not predict the slightly broken microscopic rpm - cpm symmetry that our experiments observe .",
    "so , what physics is required to produce imperfect microscopic rpm and cpm with the slightly broken symmetry ?",
    "there are two aspects to this question  the imperfection and the rpm - cpm symmetry breaking .",
    "almost all models have perfect memory at @xmath3 and imperfect memory for @xmath2 . and",
    "it seems likely that the imperfect memory that we observe could be caused by temperature effects , but this has not yet been established . on the other hand , no viable theoretical model for the slight rpm - cpm symmetry breaking existed .",
    "so we developed viable models .",
    "the key idea behind each of our models was to combine physics with spin - reversal symmetry with physics without spin - reversal symmetry .",
    "then the spin - reversal - symmetric physics produces symmetric memory @xmath4 and the non - symmetric physics produces symmetry - broken memory @xmath5 .    within the standard rxim models_viz .",
    "_ , raim , rbim , and rcim , and rfim where a denotes anisotropy , b denotes bond , c denotes coercivity , and f denotes field ",
    "the first three have spin - reversal symmetry , but the fourth ( rfim ) does not .",
    "so one way to produce slightly symmetry - broken memory is to combine the rfim with one of the symmetric models .",
    "surprisingly , another way is to combine one of the symmetric models with vector spin dynamics because vector dynamics breaks the spin - reversal symmetry .",
    "we report our work on three viable models : model 1 combines a pure rfim with a pure rcim .",
    "model 2 combines a pure raim with vector spin dynamics .",
    "model 3 combines a pure rfim with a pure spin - glass model    we explored model 1 and model 2 in the most detail . by tuning the model parameters",
    ", we were able to semi - quantitatively match our experimentally observed disorder - dependence and magnetic - field - dependence of ( i ) the domain configurations , ( ii ) the shape of the major loops , ( iii ) the values of the rpm and cpm , and ( iv ) the slight rpm - cpm symmetry breaking .",
    "note that in order to properly describe our observed magnetic domain configurations , we had to include the long - range dipolar interactions .",
    "in contrast to the sethna - dahmen rfims that predict spatially fractal magnetic domain configurations @xcite , our samples exhibit labyrinthine domain configurations due to their long - range dipolar interactions .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the physics of return point memory and complementary point memory .",
    "section 3 describes our experiments , sample fabrication , structural characterization , magnetic characterization , and coherent x - ray speckle metrology ( cxsm ) characterization .",
    "section 4 describes our data analysis methodology .",
    "section 5 describes the results of our data analysis .",
    "section 6 describes the theoretical models that we developed to account for the observed behavior of our system .",
    "section 7 presents our conclusions .",
    "in his 1903 dissertation at gttingen entitled  on the magnetization produced by fast currents and the operation of rutherford - marconi magnetodetectors , \" erwin madelung presented his rules for magnetic hysteresis as illustrated in figure 1 :    1 .   major - loop return - point memory .",
    "+ the magnetization of the sample at every point on the major loop is completely determined only by the applied field , and all first - order reversal curves starting from the major loop and going to saturation are uniquely determined by their starting point .",
    "the curve @xmath6 in fig .",
    "1 illustrates a first - order reversal curve ( forc ) .",
    "2 .   minor - loop return - point memory .",
    "+ the magnetization of the sample at every point on the major loop is completely determined solely by the value of the applied field , even when the point on the major loop is reached starting from a point inside the major loop .",
    "this holds for every order reversal curve .",
    "the curve @xmath7 illustrates this property for a second - order reversal curve ( sorc ) .",
    "3 .   the memory deletion property , a.k.a . the wiping out property . +",
    "the magnetization of the sample at every point on a reversal curve is precisely the same as that for its parent curve as soon the reversal curve returns to its parent . in this way",
    ", all memory of the previous field history between the initial departure from the parent and the return to the parent has been erased .",
    "this holds for every order reversal curve .",
    "the curve @xmath8 illustrates this for a third - order reversal curve ( torc ) .",
    "4 .   the congruency property .",
    "+ all return curves that start from reversal at the same value of the applied field have the same shape thereafter independent of the entire previous applied field history .",
    "5 .   the similarity property for initial magnetization curves .",
    "+ when any initial magnetization curve is reversed at point a , the reversed return curve to saturation will pass through the inversion symmetric point to a as it proceeds to saturation .",
    "as discussed below , we call the analogous property to the similarity property  for reversal curves that do not start from a point on the initial magnetization curve  the complementary - point memory property .",
    "madelung formulated his rules based on his careful experimental studies of different alloys of steel and published them in 1905 and 1912 @xcite . because madelung formulated his rules before the existence of magnetic domains was known , he only considered the macroscopic magnetization .",
    "nevertheless , his rules still predict the macroscopic magnetization of  any typical \" sample versus its applied field history .",
    "madelung s rules have truly been the foundation for all modern theories of hysteresis .",
    "it is therefore surprising that madelung s rules are so rarely cited .",
    "apparently this is because essentially all of the subsequent work has been focused on the preisach model .",
    "the obscurity of madelung s magnetic hysteresis work is particularly surprising because the preisach model has been well known to be unphysical for a very long time due to heavy reliance on phenomenology .",
    "of course , madelung s rules do not apply to every magnetic system .",
    "for example , many systems exhibit accomodation , reptation and magnetic viscosity effects , and all systems exhibit dynamic hysteresis effects .",
    "however , on the other hand , madelung s rules do apply to an incredible number of magnetic systems under a vast range of conditions .",
    "now that we know that the microscopic magnetic domains are intimately involved in the production of magnetic hysteresis , we immediately come to the first question at the core of our investigation : how do the magnetic domains behave on the microscopic level .",
    "do the domains remember_viz .",
    "_ , return precisely to  their initial states , or does just the ensemble average remember ?",
    "we show below that , at room temperature , some of the domains in our samples return to their original configurations and some do not , but nevertheless the macroscopic magnetization  set by the ensemble average ",
    "does return to its original value .",
    "in other words , we find that our samples have perfect macroscopic rpm , but they have imperfect microscopic rpm at room temperature .",
    "in fact , our measured rpm values for each sample demonstrate a rich , complex behavior reflecting the fundamental physics of the magnetic domains .",
    "we quantitatively measured the fraction of the domains that remember and thereby demonstrated that the disorder has a profound impact on the microscopic rpm .",
    "as we tune the disorder , our samples develop microscopic rpm that starts from zero in the low - disorder limit and jumps to a saturated value in the high - disorder limit , but never becomes perfect at room temperature .",
    "consequently , our experimental system is a finite - temperature realization of the  microscopic disorder - induced phase transition between no memory and perfect memory \" predicted by sethan , dahmen , and coworkers @xcite .    the major loop for  any typical \" magnetic system usually has an additional symmetry ",
    "it is symmetric about inversion through the origin .",
    "this inversion symmetry immediately raises the second question at the core of our investigation : how are the domains at the complementary points of the major loop related ? do the magnetic domains at the opposing points on the major loop evolve in a similar , but perhaps mirror correlated fashion ?",
    "we call this effect microscopic major loop cpm . the geometry of complementary - point memory is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 .    despite an incredible amount of effort since 1905",
    ", it has proven impossible to develop a simple , yet adequate , phenomenological model that can be used to treat all magnetic materials . we still do not have a phenomenological model for modern magnetic technology .",
    "in addition , although there has also been tremendous effort expended and progress achieved , it has similarly proven impossible to develop a general purpose micromagnetics model .",
    "we now know , based on recent theoretical work @xcite , that the detailed magnetic hysteresis properties of real materials can not be treated using standard mean - field methods .",
    "this is because the hysteresis depends on the interactions between each domain and a limited number of its neighbors , as well as between each domain and its local disorder .",
    "consequently , our approach has been to determine to what extent the nanoscale domain - level physics of our experimental system obeys madelung s rules , and then to explore whether we can better understand the observed behavior using traditional ( overly ) simplified ising models .",

    "to measure the field - history induced changes in the microscopic magnetic domain configurations , we developed coherent x - ray speckle metrology ( cxsm ) @xcite .",
    "our cxsm experiments were performed at the advanced light source at lawrence berkeley national laboratory . a schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus is shown in figure  [ fg : experimental_equip ] .",
    "we used linearly polarized x - rays from the third and higher harmonics of the beamline 9 undulator . the raw undulator beam",
    "was first reflected from a nickel - coated - bremmstrahlung - safety mirror and then passed through a water - cooled be window to decrease unwanted light .",
    "the partially coherent incident beam from the undulator was passed through a 35-micron - diameter pinhole to select a transversely coherent portion .",
    "the sample was located 40 centimeters downstream of the coherence - selection pinhole .",
    "this provided transversely coherent illumination of about a 40 micron diameter area of the sample .",
    "the transversely coherent x - ray beam was incident perpendicular to the sample surface and was scattered in transmission by the sample .",
    "the resonant magnetic scattering was detected by a soft x - ray ccd camera located 1.1 meters downstream of the sample . between the sample and the ccd camera we used a small blocker to prevent the direct beam from damaging the ccd .",
    "the photon energy was set to the cobalt l3 resonance at @xmath12 ev .",
    "these photons resonantly excited virtual 2p to 3d transitions in the cobalt atoms and thereby provided our magnetic sensitivity .",

    "we typically measured each speckle pattern for 10 to 100 seconds , so the total number of photons in each ccd image was @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",

    "the return path for the electromagnet consists of an external soft fe yoke that feeds field to vanadium permandur pole pieces that are integral to the vacuum chamber .",
    "the pressure inside the chamber during our experiments was typically @xmath18 torr .",

    "the samples had 20-nm - thick pt buffer layers , and 2.3-nm - thick pt caps to prevent oxidation .",
    "between the buffer layer and the cap , the samples had 50 repeating units of a 0.4-nm - thick co layer and a 0.7-nm - thick pt layer . while the six samples had identical multilayer structure they were grown at different argon sputtering pressures to tune the disorder in the samples .",
    "during growth , we adjusted the deposition times to keep the co and pt layer thickness constant over the entire series . for low argon pressures ,",
    "the sputtered metal atoms arrive at the growth substrate with considerable kinetic energy which locally heats and anneals the growing film .",
    "this leads to smooth co / pt interfaces produced at a low sputtering pressure . for higher argon sputtering pressures ,",
    "the sputtered atoms arrive at the growth substrate with minimal kinetic energy thereby resulting in rougher co / pt interfaces .",
    "the resulting roughness is cumulative through the samples @xcite .",
    "the magnetocrystaline anisotropy at the co / pt interface forces the magnetization to align perpendicularly to the surface of the film .",
    "our samples were grown at six different sputtering pressures : 3 , 7 , 8.5 , 10 , 12 , and 20 mtorr . due to the important and interesting magnetic properties , these samples and others very similar in form and structure",

    "the _ rms _ roughness for the samples was measured in the almaden hitachi global storage technology laboratory using two different methods .",
    "first , we measured the roughness by scanning the sample surface with an atomic force microscope ( afm ) and calculating the _ rms _ roughness from the afm images .",
    "since our samples have conformal roughness , the _ rms _ roughness of the surface is a reasonable measure of the internal _ rms _ roughness .",

    "the spin inversion symmetry of the rcim pushes the system towards anti - correlation , favoring the same microscopic spin evolution on both sides of the major hysteresis loop .",
    "in contrast , because the rfim does not possess spin - inversion symmetry , the random field can only drive the system towards positive correlation . both of these compete to determine the sign and magnitude of the correlation coefficients . in the range where the contributions from the rcim and rfim are roughly equal ,",
    "the cpm is uncorrelated while the rpm increases with the magnitude of each .",
    "although we have used a very simple discrete - spin simulation done on a 64 by 64 grid of dipolar - ising spins , note that we obtain very similar behavior to that produced by our much more sophisticated and realistic model presented earlier .              there is another fundamental explanation for the observed rpm - cpm asymmetry @xcite .",
    "even when the hamiltonian is constructed to possess spin - inversion symmetry , the dynamics describing how the magnetization changes do not have to be .",
    "in fact , the dynamics of the standard landau - lifschitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation break spin - inversion symmetry    @xmath51    the first term describes the velocity with which a spin precesses about the magnetic field . the second term describes the damping of the precessional motion produced as the spin aligns along the magnetic field .    under llg dynamics , the spins undergo damped precessional motion about their local magnetic fields .",
    "when both the external field and all the spins are reversed , the orientation of each spin and its precesssion are reversed .",
    "the precessional motion of the spins ( _ i.e. _ , their motion perpendicular to their local fields ) is not reversed , whereas the relaxational motion ( parallel to the local fields ) is reversed . as a consequence , for a disordered system ,",
    "the evolution of the magnetic domains when starting from a large negative field is not the mirror image of the evolution starting from a large positive field .",
    "therefore the spin - inversion symmetry of the hamiltonian that completely determines the equilibrium static properties does not control the non - equilibrium dynamics that are relevant for magnetic hysteresis .",
    "we first observed this effect for a vector spin model using the llg equations to describe a set of magnetic nanopillars @xcite .",
    "there we found that the major hysteresis loop was not symmetric under inversion of the applied field and the magnetization despite the fact that the hamiltonian displayed this symmetry .",
    "model 2 that we describe below attempts to capture the physics of the magnetic domains in our experimental copt layered system and it has many parallels with the scalar approach described for model 1 above .",
    "we will assume that ( 1 ) the films are disordered on the scales relevant to pattern formation , but are strongly anisotropic .",
    "( 2 ) the easy axis has small random deviations away from the direction perpendicular to the film .    from electron micrographs of similar sputtered films",
    ", we see that the layers become increasingly rough and non - planar as the disorder is increased @xcite .",
    "consequently , even though the physics of the perfect material dictates a strong anisotropy , the local direction of the easy axis will no longer be precisely perpendicular to the film . because it varies randomly in space",
    ", we write the anisotropic contribution to the hamiltonian as    @xmath52    where @xmath28 is a model parameter .",
    "higher - order corrections that are even in @xmath53 are also possible , but they are not necessary to obtain qualitative agreement with our experiments .    disorder is included through random variation in the easy axis @xmath54 for each block of spins . to adjust the effects of the disorder , a weighting factor",
    "@xmath55 was included that controls the variation from the perpendicular axis . for small values of @xmath55",
    "the variation is small and there is little disorder . at larger values ,",
    "the disorder is heavily weighted and has a large influence .",
    "we have also included the short - range ferromagnetic coupling @xmath56 .",
    "because we are attempting to model this system as a continuum , we take the usual approach of minimizing effects of the grid by writing this ferromagnetic interaction in terms of @xmath57 , the fourier transform of the spins    @xmath58    as in the scalar case , it is also crucial to include the long - range dipolar interaction    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the displacement vector between spins @xmath61 and @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the unit vector along this direction , and @xmath64 represents the strength of the dipolar coupling .",
    "although this is correct for point dipoles , we are modeling blocks of spins and must include this effect in this interaction . in particular , the short - range behavior is smoothed out by integration in the vertical direction  @xcite .",
    "we implement this as a k - space cutoff by multiplying the dipolar interaction in k - space by a gaussian @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a parameter comparable to the thickness of the sample .    finally , we include the usual interaction with the external field    @xmath67    all of the terms in the hamiltonian are bi - linear in the spins and the external field but , as discussed above , the llg equations are not . because of the symmetry breaking produced by the llg dynamics , model 2 can be tuned to produce a small rpm - cpm symmetry breaking similar to that measured by our experiments .    we have chosen the relaxation time to be of the order of the precessional period near saturating fields , that is @xmath68 . although this quantity has not been measured for our copt films , it has been measured for other similar materials .",
    "experiments on nife films show that it is very large , approximately 100  @xcite , if it were so large in our copt system , it would only accentuate the memory asymmetry further .",
    "work on cocrpt systems  @xcite has indicated that the precessional period is comparable to the relaxation time and if this is also true for our films , then our @xmath69 assumption is reasonable .    summarizing model 2 , we have coarse - grained vector spins evolving via the llg equations with thermal noise .",

    "the simulated hysteresis loops look quite similar to those for the 3 mtorr samples : corresponding to the onset of domain growth in the simulation , there is a cliff in the hysteresis loop because the magnetization decreases substantially during this phase of growth .",
    "when the disorder is high , it pins the domains by destroying translational invariance .",
    "this happens suddenly in our simulations in a similar fashion as that in the experiments suggesting a  critical disorder \" @xcite .",
    "for this  critical disorder \" and above , the spontaneous cliff - producing growth of the domains disappears , and the domains at remanence no longer look labyrinthine , but instead are much more disordered . after losing their cliff - like shape ,",

    "the rpm - cpm symmetry breaking is clearly visible .",
    "as the temperature is increased , both curves lower in value but the rpm curve still remains slightly above the cpm curve .",
    "these curves clearly grow rapidly past the  critical disorder point \" where the simulated and experimental loops change from cliff - like to smooth .    the observed memory behavior in model 2 can be explained as follows . for low disorder ,",
    "the spontaneous growth of the domains is very susceptible to thermal fluctuations .",
    "if we observe the growth of the domains for several cycles around the major loop , we find that although the initial nucleation points are precisely the same , the evolution past that point is different every time . for low disorder , it appears that the thermal fluctuations produce different domain patterns during each cycle .",
    "however , for high disorder , the pinning produced by the disorder appears to constrain the domain growth and leads to significant similarity from cycle to cycle of the domain configurations at the coercive point .    in summary ,",
    "model 2 simulated copt thin films using a spin symmetric hamiltonian with llg dynamics . unlike in our other scalar models , the llg vector _ dynamics _ is the mechanism for breaking the rpm and cpm symmetry .",

    ", width=321 ]      motivated by the above experimental and theoretical results , we attempted to determine the minimal model that would capture the essential physics of the observed memory effects . in this section ,",
    "we explore the following four questions : ( 1 ) what is the minimal model that exhibits these memory effects ? ( 2 ) do these memory effects persist at finite temperatures ? ( 3 ) how do these memory effects depend on the disorder ? and",
    "( 4 ) does the rpm - cpm symmetry breaking convincingly exceed the error bars ? we assert that it is of general interest to study the rpm and cpm for simple paradigmatic models , such as the edwards - anderson ising spin glass and the rfim @xcite      we start with the hamiltonain for the edwards - anderson @xcite spin glass ( easg ) given by    @xmath70    the spins @xmath71 lie on the vertices of a square lattice in two dimensions ( 2d ) of size @xmath72 with periodic boundary conditions . the interactions @xmath73 are gaussian distributed with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath74 .",
    "our simulations were performed by first saturating the system by applying a large external field @xmath0 and then reducing @xmath0 in small steps to reverse the magnetization .    for finite temperatures",
    ", we performed a monte carlo simulation and equilibrated until the average magnetization was independent of time for each field step . for zero temperature , we used glauber dynamics @xcite where randomly chosen unstable spins  pointing against their local field @xmath75were flipped until all spins were stable for each field step .",
    "these simulations converged rapidly and showed essentially no size - dependence past @xmath76 .",
    "we quantified the simulated rpm and cpm with @xmath77 , the overlap in real space of the spin configuration at a field @xmath0 with the configuration at a field with the same magnitude @xmath78 after an @xmath79 cycle for cpm and @xmath80 cycle for rpm    @xmath81    our results for the easg show that this system exhibits nearly complete rpm and cpm throughout the entire field range for @xmath3 .",
    "the strong cpm can be attributed to the spin - inversion symmetry of the system : upon reversing all spins @xmath82 and the magnetic field @xmath0 , the hamiltonian transforms into itself .",
    "the observation of robust rpm and cpm answers question 1 by establishing the easg as a minimal model displaying these memory effects . however , the simulated memory effects were not perfect even at @xmath3 .",
    "this was probably due to the stochastic nature of the updating : during each field sweep , the spins were selected randomly for updating .",
    "therefore , even at @xmath3 , the spin configurations did not evolve entirely along the same valleys of the energy landscape .",
    "our simulations at finite temperatures show that the rpm and cpm decreased with increasing temperature and remained finite , even though it would seem natural for the thermal fluctuations to completely wash out the microscopic memory rendering it macroscopic only .    by varying the disorder strength @xmath74 in our easg model we showed that the rpm and cpm increase dramatically with increasing disorder , in good agreement with the experiments .",
    "the physical reason behind this result lies in the fact that when the disorder is high the energy landscape develops a few preferable valleys and the system evolves along these optimal valleys .",
    "this is not the case for small disorder where several comparable shallow valleys without a single optimal path are present .",
    "finally , in relation to question 4 it is noted that in the easg the differences between the rpm and cpm are immeasurably small .",
    "next , we study the same memory effects in the 2d random - field ising model ( rfim )    @xmath83 s_i \\ ; , \\label{eq : hamrfim}\\ ] ]    here the random fields @xmath84 were chosen from a gaussian distribution with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the main differences between the rfim and the easg are that the rfim does not have frustration and does not have spin - inversion symmetry .",
    "we find that this rfim model also shows memory effects which are again stable with respect to thermal fluctuations .",
    "regarding question 4 , the rfim deviates from the easg results and correlates with the experiments : in the rfim , the rpm and cpm are different .",
    "the rpm is larger than the cpm for all temperatures due to the lack of spin - inversion symmetry in the hamiltonian . for intermediate - to - large values of the disorder ,",
    "the cpm is negligible and , in the proximity of the coercive field , the cpm correlation is even negative . in contrast , the rpm is large in the rfim . in particular , for @xmath3 the rpm is perfect due to the `` no - crossing property '' of the rfim @xcite .",
    "consequently , the rpm - cpm symmetry breaking is large over much of the parameter space . just as for the easg , the rfim memory increases due to the valleys in the energy landscape becoming more pronounced with increasing disorder .",
    "because of the way that our simulations for the pure easg model and for the pure rfim do not agree with the experiments , the following question immediately arises : can a combined easg and rfim yield results comparable to the experiments  increasing memory with increasing disorder , together with the rpm - cpm symmetry breaking ?    in order to test this , we introduced random fields into the easg that act only on a small fraction ( 5% ) of the spins in order to break the spin - inversion symmetry of the hamiltonian [ eq .

    "the error bars are the size of the symbols and thus have been neglected . , title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    since the dipolar interactions in our perpendicular anisotropy films are antiferromagnetic , they introduce extensive frustration into the system ; this is the key ingredient for spin glasses .",
    "our experimental system also contains several possible sources of random fields : spins frozen in by the local shape anisotropies produced by the locally deformed environments , unusually large crystal - field anisotropies , or by frozen - in reversed bubbles , as reported in the same experimental system by davies _ et al .",
    "consequently , it is easy to imagine that all of the necessary ingredients for the combined easg plus rfim are likely to be present in our experimental samples .",
    "results from model 3 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : mixeddis ] and clearly resemble the experimental results presented earlier .",
    "we now summarize our results for model 3 .",
    "we have found that our pure easg model , our pure rfim model , and our combined easg model plus rfim all exhibit both rpm and cpm , in which both memory effects persist to finite temperatures and both memory effects increase with increasing disorder . for our pure easg model ,",
    "the simulated rpm and cpm are identical because of the spin - inversion symmetry . for our pure rfim ,",
    "the rpm is always much larger than the cpm because of the lack of spin - inversion symmetry .",
    "our combined esag and rfim , a spin glass with diluted random fields that break the spin - inversion symmetry , reproduces the essential experimental results ",
    "it exhibits both rpm and cpm , both memory effects increase with increasing disorder , and the model can be tuned so that the rpm is a little bit larger than the cpm",
    ". all of these properties are present in fig .",
    "[ fg : mixeddis ]",
    ". it will be exciting to see if experimentally realizable spin - glass systems can be shown to have these properties .",
    "our experimental results are the first direct measurements of the effects of controlled microscopic disorder on the magnetic memory of an ensemble of magnetic domains in the such perpendicular magnetic materials .",
    "we identified and studied three different aspects of the domain - level memory : microscopic return - point memory ( rpm ) , microscopic complementary - point memory ( cpm ) , and microscopic half - loop memory ( hlm ) . because our experimental observations could not be described by any existing microscopic - disorder - based theory , we developed new theories that do account for the behavior of our experimental system .",
    "our combined experimental and theoretical work sets new benchmarks for future work .",
    "we found a very rich behavior of these memory properties in our system of perpendicular - anisotropy multilayer copt samples . at the domain level , we found disorder - induced - partial rpm and cpm , and we also found a small rpm - cpm symmetry breaking where the rpm was consistently slightly larger than the cpm .    at the domain level , we found that the hlm versus the sample magnetization was very similar for all of our samples .",
    "there was only a subtle effect ",
    "the low disorder samples had slightly higher microscopic hlm than the high disorder samples .",
    "it was surprising to us that the hlm effects were nearly sample independent whereas the rpm and cpm effects were extremely sample dependent .",
    "our observed rpm and cpm are independent of the number of major loops separating the pairs of magnetic speckle fingerprints .",
    "this shows that the deterministic components of the rpm and cpm are essentially stationary , and implies that the deterministic memory in our system is largely reset by bringing the sample to saturation .",
    "it also strongly suggests that the same disorder is producing both the deterministic rpm and cpm .",
    "our measured rpm is consistently higher than our cpm .",
    "this slightly broken symmetry imposes severe limitations on the possible theoretical models .",
    "the evolution of the rpm and cpm with disorder is also very interesting .",
    "both the rpm and cpm have their largest values just after the initial domain nucleation takes place and then diminish towards a minimum as saturation is approached . at room temperature ,",
    "the memory is imperfect  the maximum measured rpm and cpm values are less than one .",
    "we suspect that this is due to the thermal fluctuations in our samples , but have not yet demonstrated this experimentally .",
    "as we increase the disorder in our samples , there is initially little change in the memory , then at the same level of disorder there is a rapid increase in both the rpm and the cpm followed by apparent plateaus with the rpm slightly larger than the cpm .",
    "this is reminiscent of the disorder - induced transition predicted by the sethna - dahmen rfim work where the major loop shape changes from a gradual loop to a sharp loop at a critical value of the disorder . at the corresponding ",
    "critical disorder transition \" in our system , our loops also change shape , but more interestingly , and perhaps more importantly , both the rpm and cpm suddenly jump from zero to their maximum values .",
    "two possible explanations for rpm @xmath88 cpm in the disordered samples have been presented . within the current experimental framework ,",
    "it is not possible to determine which of these two methods is a more accurate description of our system .",
    "there are potential physical mechanisms that would introduce random fields into our samples . due to defects in the disordered samples , quenched spins",
    "may be present that do not reverse their direction even under the highest magnetic fields we were able to apply . in effect , even though the major loop hysteresis curve appears to be constant and unchanging , there may still be spins which persist in their original direction .",
    "these could be due to large crystal anisotropy , shape anisotropy because of the rough interfaces , or small , persistent magnetic bubbles due to incomplete saturation . in order to test for this scenario",
    ", it would be necessary to repeat the rpm and cpm measurements after saturating the samples under very high applied fields sufficient to saturate even the most stubborn spins .",
    "in contrast , our dynamical model does not require the existence of these random fields .",
    "instead it requires precessional motion to be present in the system . we know that spins precess in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "however , we do not know the extent of precession relative to damping",
    ". measurements of the ratio of the precessional and damping terms off the llg equation on similar systems @xcite have shown that precessional motion is quite significant .",
    "more experiments will be necessary to determine if this is also the case for co / pt multilayer films . these two suggested experiments , study under very high applied fields and determination of the precessional to damping ratio , should shed light on the true mechanism for spin inversion symmetry breaking in this system .",
    "there are very few direct , detailed studies of microscopic rpm , cpm , and hlm in either longitudinal or perpendicular magnetic materials and even fewer domain - level ensemble studies of such properties .",
    "it will be extremely interesting to see what our new coherent x - ray speckle metrology technique  together with our complementary x - ray magnetic microscopy studies  will teach us about the domain - level - ensemble memory in both of these technologically important and scientifically fascinating magnetic memory systems .",
