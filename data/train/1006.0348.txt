    "since the discovery of quasi periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in the lightcurves of giant flares from soft gamma repeaters ( sgr ) ( israel et al . , 2005 ; strohmayer & watts , 2005 ; watts & strohmayer , 2006 ; barat et al . , 1983 ) there has been considerable interest in their physical origin .",
    "one of the appealing explanations is that the qpos are driven by torsional oscillations of the neutron stars whose magnetic energy powers the flares ( duncan 1998 ) .",
    "this opens a unique possibility to perform an asteroseismological analysis of neutron stars , and possibly obtain a new observational window to study the neutron - star interiors .",
    "many authors have considered torsional modes to be confined to the magnetar crust , and have shown that seismological information about such modes would strongly constrain the physics of the crust ( piro 2005 , watts & strohmayer 2006 , watts & reddy 2007 , samuelsson & andersson 2007 , steiner & watts 2009 ) .",
    "however , it was quickly understood that the theoretical analysis of magnetar oscillations is complicated by the presence of an ultra strong magnetic field ( @xmath1 @xmath2 ) that is frozen into the neutron star and penetrates both the crust and the core .",
    "the field provides a channel for an intense hydro - magnetic interaction between the motion of the crust and the core , which becomes effective on the timescale of @xmath3 second ( levin 2006 ) .",
    "since the qpos are observed for hundreds of seconds after the flare , it is clear that the coupled motion of the crust and the core must be considered . in recent years",
    ", significant theoretical effort has gone into the study of this problem ( e.g. , glampedakis et al .",
    "2006 , levin 2007 , gruzinov 2008b , lee 2008 ) .",
    "this paper s analysis is based , in part , on an approach of levin ( 2007 , l07 ) .    to make progress in computing the coupled crust - core motion ,",
    "l07 has studied the time evolution of an axisymmetric toroidal displacement of a star with axisymmetric poloidal magnetic field . in that case",
    "the alfven - type motions on different flux surfaces decouple from each other , a well - known fact from previous mhd studies ( for a review see goedbloed & poedts 2004 , hereafter gp ) .",
    "one can then formulate the full dynamics of the system in terms of discrete modes of the crust which are coupled to a continuum of alfven modes in the core .",
    "l07 demonstrated that ( i ) the global modes with frequencies inside the continuum are strongly damped via a phenomenon known in mhd as _ resonant absorption _ ( see gp ) , and ( ii ) in many cases , asymptotically the system tends to oscillate with the frequencies close to the continuum edges .",
    "this result was later confirmed by gruzinov 2008b , who has used a powerful analytical technique to solve the l07 s normal - mode problem ( gruzinov noted that the resonant absorption is mathematically equivalent to landau damping ) .",
    "oscillations near the continuum edge frequencies were also observed in a number of numerical general - relativistic mhd simulations of purely fluid stars ( sotani et al .",
    "2008 , colaiuda et al .",
    "2009 , cerda - duran et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "apart from finding qpos near the continuum edges , l07 s dynamical simulations identified transient qpos with drifting frequencies ; these were transiently amplified near the crustal frequencies .",
    "no explanation for the origin of the drifts was given .",
    "in this paper , we extend the previous analyses of the hydro - magnetic crust - core coupling in an essential way . in section 2 ,",
    "we re - analyse l07 s toy model of a single oscillator coupled to a continuum , and we show that this system generically contains the _ edge normal modes _ with frequencies near the continuum edges .",
    "we show that these modes dominate the late - time dynamics of the system , and develop a formalism which allows one to predict analytically the edge mode s amplitude from the initial data .",
    "we then explore the effect of viscosity on the system ( introduced as a friction between the neighbouring continuum oscillators ) , and show that the edge mode is longer lived than all other motions of the system .",
    "we also provide a non - trivial analytical formula for the time dependence of the overall energy dissipation .    in section 3 ,",
    "we describe how transient qpos , not associated with the normal modes of the system , are obtained when parts of the core spectrum consist of densely and regularly spaced discrete modes ( and in section 5 we show that such an array of discrete modes is expected when the magnetic field in the core is not perfectly axisymmetric but has some degree of tangling ) . as a by - product of our analysis , we explain the origin of the qpo frequency drifts seen in l07 simulations .",
    "we provide simple analytical fits to the drifts , and show that when the regularity of the continuum sampling is removed ( e.g , when the frequencies are sampled as random numbers picked from the continuum range ) , the drifts disappear .    in section 4 , we set up models with a more realistic hydro - magnetic structure of the neutron - star core .",
    "we show how to find the continuum modes and their coupling to the crust for an arbitrary axisymmetric poloidal field , with an arbitrary density profile on the core ( l07s calculations , for simplicity and concreteness , were restricted to constant - density core and homogeneous magnetic field ) .",
    "we treat a more complicated case of a mixed axisymmetric toroidal - poloidal field , with radial stratification , in the appendix b. we demonstrate that for realistic field configurations , the alfven continuum of modes coupled to the crust may show a number of gaps .",
    "if a crustal mode frequency belongs to one of these gaps , a strong global discrete mode arises which dominates the late - time dynamics and whose frequency also belongs to the gap .",
    "the frequency of the gap global mode does not generally coincide with , but is often close to that of the crust .",
    "we suggest that it was these gap modes that appeared in lee s ( 2008 ) calculations as well - defined discrete global modes .",
    "so far , only axisymmetric magnetic fields have been considered in the magnetar - qpo literature , with the alfven continuum modes occupying the flux surfaces of the field . in section 5",
    "we argue that if the field is not axisymmetric but instead is highly tangled , then the alfven continuum modes become localized within small regions of individual field lines , and therefore become dynamically unimportant .",
    "instead , a set of discrete alfven modes appears , with the spacing between the modes strongly dependent on the degree of field tangling .",
    "we devise a phenomenological prescription which allows us to parametrize the field tangling for computing the dynamically important modes , and introduce an easily solvable `` square box '' model suitable for exploring the parameter range .    finally ,",
    "in section 6 , we use the suite of models built in the previous sections to explore their connection to the qpo phenomenology .",
    "we find that(a ) within the standard magnetar model , it is possible to produce strong long - lived or transient qpos with frequencies in the range of around @xmath4@xmath5hz , but only if the neutrons are decoupled from the alfven - like motion of the core ; this implies that at least one of the baryonic components of the core is a quantum fluid.(b ) our models could not produce the high - frequency @xmath0hz qpo within the standard paradigm of a magnetar core composition .",
    "in this section , we study the motion of a harmonic oscillator ( which we hereafter call the large oscillator ) which is coupled to a continuum of modes .. this model was introduced in l07 and it provides a qualitative insight into the behaviour of crustal modes ( represented by the large oscillator ) coupled to a continuum of alfven modes in the core of a magnetar .",
    "l07 found that if the large oscillator s proper frequency was within the range of the continuum frequencies , then the late - time behaviour of the system was dominated by oscillatory motion near the edges of the continuum interval . here",
    ", we give an explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the _ edge modes_. our analysis allows us to use initial data and predict the displacement amplitudes and frequencies of the system at late times .",
    "the model consists of the large mechanical oscillator with mass @xmath6 and proper frequency @xmath7 , representing a crustal elastic shear mode .",
    "attached to the large oscillator is a set of @xmath8 smaller oscillators of mass @xmath9 and proper frequency @xmath10 constituting a quasi - continuum of frequencies @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 ) .",
    "the continuum is achieved when @xmath12 while the total small - oscillator mass @xmath13 remains finite .",
    "the convenient pictorial representation is through suspended pendulae , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( see also fig . 2 of l07 ) .     of small pendulae , representing the ( quasi- ) continuum , are coupled to one large pendulum , representing the crust.,width=288 ]    the equations of motion are obtained as follows .",
    "each small oscillator is driven by the the motion of the large oscillator : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the displacement of the @xmath16 small oscillator in the frame of reference of the large oscillator , @xmath17 is the displacement of the large oscillator in the inertial frame of reference , and the right - hand side represents the non - inertial force acting on the small oscillator due to the acceleration of the large one .",
    "the large oscillator experiences the combined pull of the small ones : + @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the frequency of the big pendulum corrected for the mass loading by the small pendulae , i.e. @xmath20 .      in this subsection",
    "we explore the behavior of this system by direct numerical simulations .",
    "we found this to be helpful in the building of our intuition .",
    "we defer a semi - analytical normal - mode analysis to the next subsection .",
    "we follow l07 and for concreteness concentrate on a specific example ; it will be clear that the conclusions we reach are general .",
    "we choose @xmath21rad / second and mass @xmath22 .",
    "we choose a total number of 1000 small pendulae with frequencies @xmath23rad / second and masses @xmath24 , to mimic the continuum frequency range between @xmath25rad / second and @xmath26rad / second .",
    "the simulation is initiated by displacing the large oscillator while keeping the small pendulae relaxed ( this mimics the stresses in the crust ) , and then releasing .",
    "the subsequent motion of the system is then followed numerically by using a second order leapfrog integration scheme which conserves the energy with high precision .",
    "the resulting motion of the large pendulum can be decomposed into three stages ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] and fig .",
    "[ fig2b ] ) :        .",
    "the blue horizontal lines denote the theoretically predicted amplitude of the dominating upper edge - mode ( see section 2.3).,width=336 ]    \\(1 ) during the first 50 - 60 seconds , there is a rapid exponential decay of the large oscillator s motion , during which most of the energy is transferred to the multitude ( i.e. , the continuum ) of small oscillators .",
    "this is the so - called phenomenon of `` resonant absorption '' , which has been studied for decades in the mhd and plasma physics community ( e.g. , ionson 1978 , hollweg 1987 , goedbloed & poedts 2004 , l07 , gruzinov 2008b ) . in this first stage ,",
    "the amplitude of the big pendulum motions drops by a factor of @xmath27 .",
    "\\(2 ) after @xmath28 seconds , the exponential decay stops abruptly as the large oscillator now reacts to the collective pull of the small ones .",
    "this second stage is characterized by a slow algebraic decay of the amplitude of the big pendulum displacement .",
    "gruzinov ( 2008b ) explains this as being due to the branch cut in the oscillator s response function .",
    "\\(3 ) the motion of the large oscillator stabilizes at a constant level ( l07 missed this stage in his simulations , which he stopped too early ) .",
    "fourier transform reveals 2 qpos at the frequencies close to the continuum edges , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ; the same qpo frequencies can be observed in the previous stage ( 2 ) as well .",
    "what is the origin of the qpos , and how is this eventual stability established ? in fig .",

    "is transferred to the oscillators near the edge of the continuum.,width=336 ]    after the initial resonant absorption phase , the amplitude is distributed as a lorentzian centered on the frequency around @xmath31 ; this is because the small oscillators in resonance with the large one are the ones which gain the most energy .",
    "however , in subsequent times we see that the energy exchange occurs between the small oscillators , and that the net result of this exchange is the energy flow towards the oscillators whose frequencies are near the edges . by the time the third stage begins , the amplitudes of the oscillators near the edge stabilize and their phases become locked .",
    "they are pulling and pushing the large oscillator in unison . in the next subsection , we show that this behavior is due to the presence of the _ edge normal modes _ , and we shall derive their frequencies and amplitudes .      in this section",
    "we deal with the system of coupled harmonic oscillators , and one should be able to find its normal modes using the standard techniques ( landau and lifshitz mechanics ,  23 ) . however , the fact that all small oscillators are attached to the large one , and there is no direct coupling between the small oscillators , allows us a significant shortcut ( in appendix a , we treat a more general problem of _ several _ large oscillators coupled to a multitude of the core modes ) .",
    "we proceed as follows :    suppose that we impose on the large oscillator a periodic motion with angular frequency @xmath32 , by driving it externally with the force @xmath33 .",
    "this motion in turn drives the small oscillators according to eq .",
    "( [ vier ] ) : @xmath34 which has the steady state solution : @xmath35 where we have omitted the time dependent factor @xmath36 on both sides .",
    "the combined force @xmath37 of the small oscillators acting back on the large one ( see eq .",
    "( [ vijf ] ) ) is given by @xmath38 according to newton s second law , @xmath39 if @xmath32 corresponds to the normal - mode frequency , then @xmath40 .",
    "hence by substituting eq .",
    "( [ no8 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ secondlaw ] ) we get the following eigenvalue equation for @xmath32 :    @xmath41    in the continuum limit @xmath12 , the above equation becomes @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the mass per unit frequency of the continuum modes .    in the discrete case , the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ discretemodes ] ) are @xmath44 frequencies @xmath45 that are within the quasi - continuum ( @xmath46 , for @xmath47 ; quasi - continuum modes ) , and @xmath48 modes with frequencies @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( the edge - modes ) that are near the edges , but outside , of the continuum ( i.e. @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) .",
    "it can be shown from eq .",
    "( [ discretemodes ] ) that in the limit @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the contribution of the small oscillator to the @xmath55-th quasi - continuum mode is completely dominated by the pendulae that are in close resonance with the mode . more precisely , one can show that as the number of oscillators @xmath8 increases and @xmath9 decreases , the number of small oscillators contributing to the mode energy remains constant .",
    "however , for the two edge modes there is no such singular behavior in the limit of large @xmath8 , and consequently they play a special role in the dynamics of the system .",
    "this last point is clearly seen in the continuum case represented by eq .",
    "( [ contmodes ] ) .",
    "the eigenvalue equation has no real solutions in the range of small - oscillator continuum @xmath56 , since the response function @xmath57 is ill - defined in this interval is performed along the contour chosen according to the landau rule .",
    "one then obtains a `` resonantly absorbed '' or `` landau - damped '' mode ( gruzinov 2008b , l07 ) , which exactly represents the exponential decay of stage ( 1 ) in our numerical experiment of the previous subsection . ] .",
    "however , the edge modes on both sides of the continuum interval remain , and their frequencies can be found by numerically evaluating the zero points of @xmath57 in eq .",

    "analytically , one can find the following scaling for the distance @xmath60 between the mode frequency and the nearest edge @xmath61 of the continuum range :    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is a constant of order unity .",
    "the larger is the density of continuum modes at the edge @xmath64 , the further is the edge mode pushed away from the continuum range .",
    "it is particularly interesting to consider the case when the continuum interval is limited by a turning point ( l07 ) with the divergent density of states near the edge , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is a constant . in this case",
    "the distance from the edge - mode frequency to the nearest continuum edge is given by @xmath67 the quadratic dependence in eq .",

    "we show how to calculate the edge - mode amplitudes and qpo strengths from the initial data .      in the continuum limit ,",
    "the only modes with real oscillatory frequency are the edge modes .",
    "thus , as we demonstrate explicitly below , they dominate the late - time dynamics of the system when the number @xmath8 of small oscillators becomes large .",

    "first , we expect that crustal modes with frequencies inside the alfven continuum will be damped quickly by resonant absorption ( `` landau - damping '' in the terminology of gruzinov 2008b ) .",
    "second , as with our previous model we expect the late time behavior of the system to show qpo s near the edges of the continuum , or edge modes .",
    "the third important feature of our model is that the continuum may possibly contain gaps , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ core_cont2 ] . in this case",
    "there is the possibility that crustal frequencies fall inside the gaps and remain undamped . in all of our simulations",
    "these expectations have come true .",
    "we will now show the results from a simulation which illustrate the above mentioned effects .",
    "the basic freedom of choice that we have for our model is the strength and geometry of the equilibrium magnetic field .",
    "we choose here a purely poloidal magnetic field with an average strength at the surface of @xmath213 , induced by a circular current loop of radius @xmath214 .",
    "this field gives us a gap in the continuum at frequencies @xmath215 .",
    "we consider the lowest degree odd crustal modes with frequencies @xmath216 and @xmath217 , which we couple to 5000 continuum oscillators ( the alfven continuum ) .",
    "we sample the continuum at 1000 randomly chosen flux surfaces , and at each flux surface we consider 5 alfven overtones .    like with our toy model from section 2",
    ", we initiate the simulation by displacing the crust ( @xmath218 ) while keeping the continuum oscillators ( the alfven modes ) relaxed ( @xmath219 ) .    in figures",
    "[ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] we show the resulting power spectrum for 2 different models . in the first one ,",
    "the crustal frequencies are located inside the core continuum range , and the peaks due to the edge modes appear .",
    "by contrast , in the second case one of the crustal frequencies belongs to the gap , and a peak representing the global gap mode strongly stands our above the background .",
    "we note that the gap - mode s frequency lies close to but does not coincide with the crustal - mode frequency ; we found this to be a generic feature of our models , with the difference of @xmath220% for the typical model parameters .",
    "the gap modes are particularly interesting because they have relatively large amplitudes , and are not as strongly damped by viscosity as the edge modes .",
    "it must be emphasized that for all persistent modes in the system , the position in the frequency space of the core alfven continuum plays the key role in setting the global - mode frequency and in determining its longevity .",
    "we note that lee ( 2008 ) has used a different method to identify discrete modes in a magnetar with similar magnetic configuration to ours .",
    "these modes were not associated with crustal frequencies , and we strongly suspect that they were located in the gaps of the continuum spectrum and could be identified with the edge or gap modes presented in this work .",
    "our preceding discussion of the continuum was predicated on the foliation of the axisymmetric magnetic field into the flux surfaces , with each of the singular continuum mode localized on the flux surfaces .",
    "these modes are `` large''-they are coherent over the spacial extent comparable to the size of the system , and thus they play an important role in the overall dynamics - they are responsible for the resonant absorption of the crust oscillations , and contribute to generating the edge and gap modes . but what happens if the field can not be foliated into the flux surfaces , but is instead tangled in a complicated way ?",
    "one can argue that the continuum part of the spectrum still persists , as follows :        consider an arbitrary field line anchored at the crust - core interface at both ends , and choose a tube of field lines of infinitesimal radius which is centered on the original field line ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that a twisting alfven mode exists in the tube : it is obtained by the circular rotation of the fluid around the central field line , propagating along the central field line with the local alfven velocity . since there is a continuum of the field - line lengths ,",
    "there is also a continuum of alfven modes .",
    "however , the modes we constructed are highly localized in space and and have a small leverage in the overall dynamics .",
    "we conjecture that the more tangled the fields are , the less role do the singular continuum modes play in the overall dynamics .    whilst we can not rigorously prove this conjecture , we can motivate it as follows : consider an area element @xmath221 of random orientation with the normal @xmath222 inside the star , and consider a shearing motion along the element .",
    "this shearing motion will be resisted by the @xmath223 component of the magnetic field , with the effective shear modulus of order @xmath224 where @xmath225 stands for averaging over the area element . for ordered field",
    ", it is possible to choose the orientation of the area element so that @xmath226 ; the presence of such an orientation makes a fundamental difference between mhd and elasticity theory and is responsible for the presence of continuous spectrum in mhd .",
    "however , if the linear size of the @xmath221 is greater than the characteristic length on which the field is tangled , then @xmath227 is non - zero for all orientations of @xmath222",
    ". therefore , for highly - tangled fields there can be no large - scale singular continuum modes , and their existence is restricted to the small scales .",
    "hence our assertion that for strongly tangled fields continuum modes play a secondary dynamical role .",
    "one is then faced with the problem when crustal modes are coupled to a set of discrete core alfven modes . in appendix",
    "a we show how to find the eigen - solution of such a problem , provided that all of the coupling coefficients are known .",
    "how does one quantify the degree to which the fields are tangled ?",
    "some insight comes from the numerical simulations of braithwaite and colleagues , who have studied what type of fossil fields remain in a stratified star after an initial period of fast relaxation .",
    "consider a stable fossil field field configuration , such as the one obtained in the simulations of braithwaite and spruit ( 2004 ) and braithwaite and nordlund ( 2006 ) [ see also gruzinov ( 2008a ) for analytical considerations ] .",
    "there , the final field is nearly , but not perfectly axisymmetric and has a small - scale random component . for a less - centrally concentrated initial field , braithwaite ( 2008 )",
    "shows that the final fossil field is in general non - axisymmetric and can have a complicated topology .    as a starting point",
    ", we shall consider the nearly axisymmetric field with a small random component .",
    "the latter acts like a small extra shear modulus @xmath227 and dynamically couples the flux surfaces of the axisymmetric component .",
    "we then quantify the degree of tangling by the relative value of @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",

    "this qpo is particularly strong and long - lived in the hard x - rays , reaching the amplitude of @xmath308% over the time interval of @xmath27 seconds ( i.e. , it persists for almost @xmath309 oscillation periods ! ) .",
    "watts and strohmayer ( 2006 ) argued that this frequency corresponds to the crustal shear mode with a single radial node ( see also piro 2005 ) ; this interpretation , if correct , would strongly constrain the thickness of the crust and rule out the fluid strange stars as magnetar candidates ( watts & reddy , 2007 ) . to investigate this suggestion ,",
    "we have introduced several high - frequency low - j crustal modes into our square - box simulations . however , as is demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] , the high - frequency modes are strongly damped and at no time during the simulations do we observe any significant power at those frequencies .",
    "this is to be expected .",
    "no natural axisymmetric model has gaps in the alfven continuum at such high frequencies , so global modes are strongly absorbed .",
    "one could expect that if the alfven modes are discrete in the core due to the field tangling , this problem would not arise .",
    "however , even in the discrete case the frequency spacing between the modes is around @xmath4 hz , which is much smaller than @xmath310 hz .",
    "thus the grid of alfven waves is so dense that it is effectively seen as the absorbing continuum by the modes around @xmath310 hz . our detailed simulations , of the type shown in figs .",
    "[ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] , fully confirm this qualitative picture .",
    "the concern about the viability of high - frequency qpos as being due to the physical oscillations of standard - model magnetars has been raised in the original l06 paper on the basis of rather simplistic calculations .",
    "as our work here shows , more detailed calculations partially alleviate the l06 concern for the frequencies below @xmath311hz , but only if the neutrons are decoupled from the alfven motion in the core , i.e. if at least one baryonic superfluid ( protons or neutrons ) are present in the neutron - star core .",
    "our analysis sustains l06 concern for the high - frequency qpos , in particular for the strong long - lived qpo at 625hz .",
    "its explanation seems to require either qpo production in the magnetosphere , or a somewhat radical revision of the magnetar model .",
    "just how radical this revision has to be will be explored in a separate study .",
    "our work presented here has several shortcomings .",
    "we have limited ourselves to the linear approximation , and a non - linear regime may bring surprises .",
    "direct non - linear simulations of axisymmetric oscillations of a magnetised fluid star has been carried out recently by cerda - duran , stergioulas , & font ( 2009 ) . at this stage",
    "it is difficult to say whether non - linearities introduce significantly new qpo features to their model ; their results have largely been in agreement with the linear simulations of colaiuda , beyer , & kokkotas ( 2009 ) . however , the computational techniques seem promising and we do not exclude that large - amplitude simulations of stars with the crust will show qualitatively new features .",
    "another limitation of our work is that we have assumed that once the flare sets the magnetar into motion , the magnetar s oscillations are not driven externally",
    ". this may not be the case in real flares : some energy stored in the pre - flare magnetar may be released gradually , and this release could be extended in time into the flare s tail . the latter consideration is straightforward to incorporate phenomenologically into our model , and we plan to address it in our future work .",
