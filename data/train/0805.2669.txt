    "less is known about the connection of star formation and nuclear activity in individual high redshift objects , and the controlling physical processes .",
    "a related basic observational goal is to quantify both agn luminosity and star formation in an as wide as possible set of galaxy populations , a task that is posing considerable technical difficulties for some types of objects .",
    "a particularly interesting population are the luminous agn that are traced by optically selected qsos .",
    "evolutionary connections between intense starburst events and qsos have been proposed early on ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and naturally suggest that the luminous agn phase coincides with or follows after a period of intense star formation .",
    "while still limited in spatial resolution and requiring simplifying assumptions , increasingly advanced models of these processes now become available .",

    "indications have been obtained for intense star formation events in the host of high redshift qsos .",
    "perhaps the most important is the detection of submm or mm continuum ( rest frame far - infrared ) from dust in part of the high - z qso population .",
    "if heated by star formation , this emission indicates high star formation rates similar to those in submillimeter galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "large molecular gas reservoirs sufficient to sustain intense star formation have been detected in co ( see summaries in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in some of the brightest systems also in tracers of dense molecular gas @xcite .",
    "finally , the [ cii ] 157@xmath4 m fine structure line was detected in a few high - z quasars @xcite at a ratio to the rest frame far - infrared emission similar to the ratio in local ulirgs , consistent with massive star formation .",
    "while these observations indicate a plausible picture of massive star formation in some qso hosts , they need independent support , in particular to better discriminate between star formation and agn heating of the observed rest frame far - infrared continuum .",
    "we have hence initiated a program using the mid - infrared ` pah ' emission features as tracers of star formation in the hosts of high - z qsos .    because of their presence in star forming environments with a wide range of physical conditions but absence close to powerful agn , the main mid - infrared pah emission features at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , and 11.3@xmath4",
    "m have been used extensively as extragalactic star formation indicators .",
    "the calibration factor between pah luminosity and star formation rate depends on average physical conditions in the interstellar medium of the galaxy probed .",
    "this is indicated both in the relatively weaker pah in galaxies with intense interstellar radiation fields ( as measured by the large grain dust temperature from their seds , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in the sublinear increase of pah emission with p@xmath5 hydrogen recombination line emission , that is observed in spatially resolved studies of nearby galaxies @xcite . for the specific case of star formation indicators for qso hosts ,",
    "the associated uncertainty is outweighed by several advantages .",
    "pah emission from starbursts is very luminous and thus less easily outshone by the powerful agn . unlike other popular star formation indicators like h@xmath5 or mid - infrared 24@xmath4 m continuum ,",
    "it will not be quickly overwhelmed by strong agn emission in the very same tracers .",
    "it is also less sensitive than e.g. the optical [ oii ] 3727  line to the significant internal obscuration that is typical for starburst regions .",
    "in @xcite and @xcite we have applied these techniques to local z@xmath60.3 palomar - green ( pg ) qsos , detecting pah emission in many objects and concluding that likely most of their @xmath710@xmath8  far - infrared luminosity is due to star formation . comparing average spectra and seds of groups of qsos that are differing in their level of far - infrared emission",
    ", we were able to derive an infrared sed for the pure agn , after subtraction of host star formation .",
    "several spectroscopic studies have shown that spitzer - irs spectroscopy with modest integration times of at most a few hours per source can successfully detect the pah emission of the most luminous z@xmath02.5 star forming events , which approach infrared luminosities of 10@xmath9  and star formation rates around 1000/yr .",
    "such detections have been obtained for submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) @xcite as well as for a subset of bright spitzer 24@xmath4 m selected galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "substantially longer integrations exceeding 10 hours in an irs spectral order have been demonstrated to be able to detect yet fainter pah emission at similar redshifts with a peak of the rest frame 7.7@xmath4 m feature of 0.4mjy or less @xcite .",
    "probing pah emission to these levels would be highly interesting for a complete sample of luminous z@xmath02.5 qsos but expensive in observing time .",
    "systematic difficulties arise in detecting pah features on a strong agn continuum that additionally has structure due to silicate emission .",
    "the silicate emission is strong in regions of the spectrum where the main pah complexes are weak , and thus tends to wash out the pah - induced structure , as demonstrated for some local pg qso spectra in @xcite .    in this paper",

    "pah 7.7@xmath4 m may also contribute to some extent to this feature .    in this paper , we focus on analysis of the pah emission and its implications for star formation in the qso hosts . given the s / n of the spectra and the variations in slope and shapes of continuum and silicate emission in agn , we do not attempt to derive independent fluxes for the various pah features",
    ". informed by the spectra of local qsos and supported by the average spectrum of fig .",
    "[ fig : averagehighz ] , we quantify the overall level of pah emission by decomposing the qso spectra into a scaled and resampled starburst template ( based on the iso - sws spectrum of m82 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at the nominal redshift of the qso , and the underlying agn emission which consists of a dust continuum and silicate emission that is turning up beyond @xmath08@xmath4 m .",
    "results of this decomposition are shown in figure  [ fig : allhighzdecomp ] .",
    "the combination of agn continuum and silicate emission varies smoothly with wavelength over the range of interest . the first signature of pah in such spectra that is already visible at modest s",
    "/ n then is the strongest 7.7@xmath4 m feature and its short wavelength steep flank , while its longer wavelength side is often less pronounced , due to the combined presence of 8.6@xmath4 m pah and the upturn of silicate emission .",
    "the strength of the starburst component in the decomposition is adjusted to produce a smooth residual agn emission at the locations of the 6.2 and 7.7@xmath4 m features , in particular to remove the steep short wavelength flank of the 7.7@xmath4 m feature . given the s / n of the data we do not attempt to derive pah feature ratios by multi - feature fits , but obtain from the simple template a more robust characterisation of the overall level of pah emission which we represent by the flux of the brightest ( 7.7@xmath4 m ) feature . these pah 7.7@xmath4 m fluxes ( table  [ tab : results ] ) are measured in the scaled starburst template resulting from the decomposition , by fitting lorentzian features for the pahs plus an underlying residual continuum .",
    "pah 7.7@xmath4 m fluxes listed in table  [ tab : results ] can thus be directly compared to the results for local qsos presented by @xcite .",
    "we list in table  [ tab : results ] the measured noise per resolution element over the rest frame 6.58@xmath4 m region of the actual spectra , defined as rms around a linear fit to the data after subtraction of the scaled pah template and its associated feature structure . by quoting the noise measured in this way from the spectra ,",
    "we implicitly include possible noise contributions for stronger continua , that may arise for example due to more difficult outlier identification and fringing .",
    "this noise may be conservatively overestimated if the continuum is slightly curved over this range .",
    "noise @xmath00.2mjy per spectral sample as obtained for some of our weaker continuum targets is in good agreement with the nominal irs sensitivity for our observing parameters , as implemented in the spitzer science center spec - pet tool .    for the 9 sources for which we report pah detections in table  [ tab : results ] , the peak height of pah emission in the starburst component obtained from the decomposition",
    "is required to be at least 3 times the measured local noise .",
    "these significances of 313 for the pah emission effectively reflect the significance of the short wavelength flank of the 7.7@xmath4 m feature . at longer wavelengths , systematic variations in shape of underlying continuum and in particular the strength and detailed shape of the onset of agn silicate emission at @xmath19 m start to become more and more limiting , preventing reliable use of these wavelengths to verify or improve the formal significance .",
    "several of the targets ( smmj04315 + 102177 , kuv0806 + 4037 , hs1002 + 4400 , lbqs1230 + 1627b ) show pah with peak height that is for the individual sources just above the peak / noise=3 detection limit . in combination with the possibility that the mentioned uncertainties on agn continuum and silicate shape affect to a lesser extent also the short flank of the 7.7@xmath4 m pah , we estimate that individual pah fluxes for these weak pah detections can be uncertain at the 3050%  level .",
    "we caution that they should not be used for analyses going significantly beyond the modest accuracy requirements of the luminosity analyses presented below .",
    "upper limits are estimated analogously , for the pah template scaled to a level where the features would remain visibly detectable on top of the continuum and the silicate feature .",
    "the irs spectra of the sources with pah nondetections are still consistent with the presence of pah emission at peak feature fluxes similar to the sources with detections .",
    "again , the main limitation is systematic , due to the strong and structured underlying continuum and silicate emission in these targets . in the spectrum of lbqs 0018 - 0220 , for example , inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : allhighz ] shows that the 7 - 8@xmath4 m region of the spectrum , observed with good s / n , may represent either pah emission partly filling in the region before an upturn of silicate emission , or be due to variations in shape / slope of this feature , which is strong for lbqs 0018 - 0220 , and the underlying continuum .",
    "such variations are observed in local agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we list in table  [ tab : results ] pah upper limits considering this possiblity rather than only reflecting the detector noise .",
    "we will compare below the pah emission of high - z qsos with the rest frame far - infrared emission .",
    "partly , this is possible by simply using the rest frame @xmath20 m continuum that can be obtained from the published ( sub)mm photometry with minimal extrapolation . for other purposes and for comparison with the local qso population we need to extrapolate to the rest frame far - infrared peak which is constrained by direct observations for very few high redshift qsos only .",
    "we do so by assuming that the detected ( sub)mm emission reflects a rest frame t=40k , emissivity index @xmath21=1.5 greybody spectrum .",
    "these parameters are in reasonable agreement with the dust temperature @xmath036k suggested for the submillimeter galaxy population by @xcite and with 40 - 60k suggested by @xcite for high - z qsos , from the combination of 350@xmath4 m photometry with longer wavelength observations . for three qsos overlapping with our sample ( kuv 0806 + 4037 , hs 1002 + 4400 ,",
    "sbs 1408 + 567 ) , @xcite find 32k , 38k , and 35k respectively , and the fir - warmer qsos in their small sample may include objects with a smaller ratio of host fir / submm to agn emission .",
    "similarly , our simple extrapolation to rest frame 60@xmath4 m for h1413 + 117 ( the cloverleaf ) is in good agreement with the observations of @xcite and @xcite . at redshift z@xmath02.4 ,",
    "changing the adopted temperature by @xmath225k will change the estimated rest frame 60@xmath4 m flux by @xmath2360% and @xmath2445% , respectively .",
    "this is the dominant source of uncertainty in the estimated rest frame 60@xmath4 m emission , since the original ( sub)mm measurements for our irs sample are s / n@xmath255 by sample definition . using the t=40k @xmath21=1.5 assumption we extrapolate to the rest frame fir peak of this component for all our sources , which we express as @xmath26 m ) for consistency with the local qso work of @xcite .",
    "these 60@xmath4 m luminosities are listed in table  [ tab : results ] . for sources with published independent 850@xmath4 m and 1.2 mm photometry we have averaged results from the two possible extrapolations .",
    "comparison of the pah detections and limits to the rest frame far - infrared emission of the sample qsos , and comparison to other populations is the key to testing the hypothesis that both pah and far - infrared trace intense starbursts in the hosts .",
    "we do such comparisons first in directly observed quantities , and then using pah luminosities in combination with fir luminosities derived with the greybody extrapolation described above .",
    "[ fig : pah222 ] shows a comparison of the pah 7.7@xmath4 m peak flux density with the flux at rest frame wavelength 222@xmath4 m .",
    "the latter corresponds to an observed wavelength of 850@xmath4 m for z@xmath02.8 , the specific redshift chosen for consistency with previous work on smgs @xcite .",
    "this is a simple diagram based on directly observed quantities , and has minimal sensitivity to sed assumptions for the extrapolation from the observed submm / mm point to rest frame 222@xmath4 m .",
    "the distribution of the ratio of continuum - subtracted pah peak flux density and rest frame fir continuum @xmath27 is very similar for our mm - bright qsos , for the submillimeter galaxy sample of @xcite , and for local ulirgs .",
    "the median log(@xmath27 ) is -1.14 , -1.32 and -1.26 for the qsos , smgs , and ulirgs , respectively , and the distribution for the qsos can be drawn at @xmath2525% probability from the same distribution as either the smgs or the ulirgs , according to a two - sided kolomogorov - smirnov test .    moving from observed quantities to pah and far - infrared luminosities , fig .",
    "[ fig : pahtofir ] shows that the mm - bright high - z qsos extend the relation between these luminosities found for local pg qsos by @xcite by an order of magnitude towards higher luminosities , and that the relation for the qso population crosses the locus for star - forming ulirgs .",
    "the pah and fir data of the mm bright qsos agree with a scenario where these two tracers are jointly originating in starbursts in the hosts .",
    "these starbursts reach smg - like luminosities of @xmath28 in the most luminous ( unlensed ) targets of our sample .",
    "individual pah - based star formation rates can be derived for our sample and are listed in table  [ tab : results ] . concerning the calibration factor applied , the similarity of the pah / fir ratio in our sample objects and ulirgs permits us to use the ratio l(pah)/l(fir)@xmath0 0.013 derived for the starburst - like ulirgs in @xcite , in combination with the calibration of fir - based star formation rates by @xcite . because of the changes of pah / fir with galaxy properties discussed above , it is worth recalling that the resulting @xmath29=3.5\\times 10^{-42}l_{pah}\\ [ erg\\ s^{-1}]$ ] assumes ulirg - like physical conditions in the interstellar medium of the galaxy observed .",
    "pah based star formation rates for our high - z sample range from about 200 to 3000 /yr . as was found for local qsos and their far - infrared emission @xcite , use of the pah diagnostic provides strong support for massive star forming events in the mm bright qsos , at yet an order of magnitude larger luminosities .",

    "another target ( he 1104 - 1805 ) has been searched for co @xcite , but the nondetection may not be meaningful given the narrow bandwidth of this co search , which may miss the target co line for plausible uncertainties of the optical input redshift .",

    ", our pah spectroscopy does not find evidence for star formation rates above 3000yr@xmath3 ( starburst luminosities",
    "much larger than 10@xmath50 ) .",
    "this saturation occurs at luminosities similar to the upper end of the luminosity range spanned by the submm galaxy population , a limit that is often related to the star formation rate in a maximal starburst that is converting much of its gas into stars over just a few dynamical times ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in support of this view , a slower than linear increase ( or saturation at high agn luminosities )",
    "is also inferred for the relation of cold gas mass and agn luminosity , from a synopsis of co measurements for high - z / high - l qsos @xcite .",
    "local pg qsos are found in a region of the fundamental plane for elliptical galaxies and spheroids that is hosting moderate mass ellipticals with corresponding black hole masses @xmath51 , and accreting efficiently at an eddington ratio @xmath00.25 @xcite .",
    "relative to the host star formation rate , their agn growth rates are more than an order of magnitude larger than needed to explain the locally observed bh mass to bulge mass relation under the assumption of coeval growth @xcite .",
    "the increased l(agn)/l(sf ) for the high - z qsos and in particular the mm - faint ones places them in a yet more pronounced phase of agn growth proceeding much more rapidly than host growth .",
    "the failure up to now to identify matching extreme @xmath52 star forming events also in other galaxies and surveys indicates this is not just due to a time delay between agn and host growth , but must reflect intrinsically different durations of the agn growth and host growth phases .",
    "in the context of quantitatively constraining the coexistence of star formation and agn activity in different classes of high redshift galaxies , we have used spitzer - irs mid - infrared spectroscopy to detect pah emission in the spectra of nine out of twelve mm - bright z@xmath02 radio quiet qsos , with optical luminosities l@xmath1 to 10@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "the detections provide strong support for the presence of intense star formation up to @xmath03000yr@xmath3 in their hosts , that is dominating their rest frame far - infrared emission .",
    "the typical luminous z@xmath02 qso that is not preselected for mm emission has lower star formation rate @xmath35700yr@xmath3 and the mm - faint part of this population may include objects that are agn dominated out to rest - frame far - infrared wavelengths , due to luminous agn but at best modest level of star formation . toward the high luminosity and redshift qsos ,",
    "there is a flattening in the relation between starburst and agn luminosity that is observed for local pg qsos , and no object in our sample has a pah - measured star formation rate above 3000yr@xmath3 .",
    "this work is based on observations made with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under a contract with nasa .",
