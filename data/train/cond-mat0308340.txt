    "pyrite type disulfides of 3@xmath7 transition metals have been extensively studied as these systems are expected to be well suited for the experimental investigations of electron correlation effects in narrow band electron systems . in the isostructural pyrite series , @xmath8s@xmath3 ( @xmath8  =  fe , co , ni , cu and zn ) , the physical properties of the system evolves from the progressive filling of the 3@xmath7 bands of @xmath9 symmetry and exhibit a wide variety of electrical and magnetic properties @xcite . the ground state metallic or insulating properties of the series appear mostly in agreement with the single particle band theory .",
    "thus , fes@xmath3 and zns@xmath3 are insulators where the @xmath9 band is entirely empty for fes@xmath3 and totally occupied for zns@xmath3 , whereas cos@xmath3 and cus@xmath3 with 1/4 and 3/4 band fillings are metals , as expected @xcite . however , nis@xmath3 , in spite of its half - filled @xmath9 band , is insulating in contrast to results based on band structure calculations and is thought to be driven by electron correlations giving rise to the mott insulating state @xcite .",
    "it is found that nise@xmath3 , with the same pyrite structure , is completely miscible with nis@xmath3 in the entire composition range , forming the solid solution nis@xmath0se@xmath1 .",
    "nise@xmath3 is metallic and thus the ground state of the solid solution changes over from insulating to a metallic one at @xmath10 @xcite , without any change in the symmetry of the crystal structure @xcite and is believed to be an ideal testing ground for various many - body theories for metal - insulator transitions in strongly correlated narrow band electron systems @xcite .    at room temperature",
    ", nis@xmath3 is a paramagnetic insulator with a band gap of 0.3  ev , estimated from optical studies @xcite , while the transport measurements suggest an activation energy of 0.2  ev @xcite .",
    "it is also found that for a narrow range of composition near @xmath11 , the system undergoes a transition from antiferromagnetic insulator to antiferromagnetic metal with decreasing temperature @xcite .",
    "the low temperature antiferromagnetic metallic state vanishes around @xmath12 , leading to a paramagnetic metallic ground state of the system @xcite .",
    "nis@xmath3 crystallizes in the cubic pyrite structure ( @xmath13 space group ) with the lattice parameter , @xmath14    @xcite .",
    "each ni atom is coordinated with 6 sulphur atoms in a slightly distorted octahedral environment with the 3@xmath7 level split essentially into a lower lying @xmath15 triplet and a higher lying @xmath9 doublet .",
    "the ni - s distance in nis@xmath3 ( @xmath16  2.40   ) is slightly larger than that in other divalent sulphides of ni , such as nis(@xmath16  2.39   ) and banis@xmath3 ( @xmath16  2.32   ) .",
    "one characteristic feature of the structure of nis@xmath3 is the presence of very short s - s bonds ( @xmath17  2.06   ) compared to that in other sulphides , such as nis ( @xmath17  3.44   ) and banis@xmath3 ( @xmath17  3.14   ) .",
    "this leads to the formation of s@xmath18 dimers , indicating the presence of strong s - s interactions in the system .",
    "the electronic structure of nis@xmath0se@xmath1 has been studied extensively over the years , though mainly using uv - photoemission spectroscopy . however , a recent high - resolution uv photoemission study of this series with @xmath19 @xcite established that the surface electronic structure of this system behaves very differently compared to that of the bulk .",
    "these differences can be clearly observed with the surface sensitive uv photoemission technique , appearing close to the fermi energy and exhibiting interesting changes in the electronic structure as a function of the temperature .",
    "these changes can only be seen within 500 mev of @xmath20 and do not appear to affect even the uv photoemission spectrum in the main valence band region appearing nearly 2 ev below @xmath20 .",
    "x - ray photoemission spectroscopy is known to be more bulk sensitive than uv - photoemission spectroscopy ; therefore , it is more appropriate to use this technique to study the gross electronic structure of nis@xmath3 and related compounds and its evolution across the solid solution series",
    ". it is also well known that electron - correlation effects are important to describe the electronic structure of these systems while single - particle band theories fail .",
    "different configuration - interaction models including electron correlation effects have been proposed to explain the valence band ( vb ) @xcite and core level spectra @xcite in the past ; however , there has been no consistency between different models used and also between models used for the core level and valence band spectra . in the present study",
    ", we investigate the electronic structure of nis@xmath0se@xmath1 system using x - ray photoelectron spectroscopic measurements in conjunction with parameterized many body calculations based on a single model hamiltonian with the same set of parameter values for both core level and valence band spectra . here",
    ", we also study the evolution of the core level and valence band spectra across the solid solution and discuss their implications .",
    "samples of nis@xmath0se@xmath1 with @xmath21 , 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.8 and 1.2 used for the present study were prepared by the standard solid state reaction techniques reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "x - ray diffraction patterns as well as resistivities of the samples were found to be in agreement with the reported data @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic measurements were carried out in a combined vsw spectrometer with a base pressure of 2@xmath22 mbar equipped with a monochromatized al  k@xmath23 x - ray source with an overall instrumental resolution better than 0.8  ev . all the experiments were performed at 120  k and the sample surface was cleaned _ in situ _ periodically during the experiments by scraping with an alumina file ; the surface cleanliness was monitored by recording the carbon 1@xmath24 and oxygen 1@xmath24 core level xp signals .",
    "the reproducibility of the spectral features were confirmed in each case .",
    "the binding energy was calibrated to the instrument fermi - level that was determined by recording the fermi - edge region of a clean silver sample .",
    "core level and valence band  ( vb ) spectra were calculated for nis@xmath25 cluster with an octahedral structure , within a parameterized many - body multi - band model including orbital dependent electron - electron ( multiplet ) interactions ; the details of these calculations have been described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the calculations were performed in the symmetry adapted @xmath15 and @xmath9 basis including the tm 3@xmath7 and the bonding sulphur 3@xmath26 orbitals . in the calculation for the valence band spectrum ,",
    "the s  3@xmath26 spectral contribution was obtained by the resolution broadening of the s  3@xmath26 partial dos obtained from the lmto band structure calculation @xcite , while the ni  3@xmath7 contribution to the spectrum was evaluated within the cluster model .",
    "this is reasonable in view of the negligible correlation effects within the broad band s  3@xmath26 manifold .",
    "moreover , the s  3@xmath26 spectral distribution is strongly influenced by the short s - s bonds in the s@xmath27 dimers , not included in the cluster model .",
    "in contrast , such effects are described accurately within the lmto approach .",
    "the calculations were performed by the lanczos algorithm and the calculated one - electron removal spectra were appropriately broadened to simulate the experimental spectra . in the ni",
    "2@xmath26 core level calculation , doniach-@xmath28unji@xmath29 line shape function @xcite was used for broadening the discrete energy spectrum of the cluster model , in order to represent the asymmetric line shape of core levels and is also consistent with other core levels in the system ( s  2@xmath26 and se  3@xmath7 ) . in the case of valence band spectral calculations ,",
    "energy dependent lorentzian function was used for the lifetime broadening .",
    "other broadening effects arising from the resolution broadening and solid state effects , such as the band structure and phonon broadenings , were taken into account by convoluting the spectra with a gaussian function .",
    "the broadening parameters were found to be consistent with values used earlier for similar systems @xcite .",
    "the s  2@xmath26 core level spectra for the samples studied are shown in the main panel of fig .  1 , as open circles .",
    "for nis@xmath3 , the experimental s  2@xmath26 spectrum shows a spin - orbit split doublet as expected and the overlapping solid line shows the simulated spectrum using the usual constrain on the intensity ratio ( 2:1 ) between the spin - orbit split partners , 2@xmath30 and 2@xmath31  @xcite .",
    "however , for @xmath32 , we see two more features in the spectra , indicating the presence of overlapping se  3@xmath26 levels in the same binding energy range . we have analyzed the experimental spectra for @xmath33 samples in terms of contribution of two spin - orbit split doublets , simulating the s  2@xmath26 and se  3@xmath26 states and the resulting fits from least - square - error analysis are shown as the overlapping solid lines in each case , illustrating a very good agreement . in the inset",
    "i , we show the individual components of the s  2@xmath26 and se  3@xmath26 , separately for @xmath34 . in order to estimate the relative se / s ratio in the surface region of the samples probed by the photoemission technique ,",
    "we take the ratio of the intensities of se  3@xmath26 and s  2@xmath26 for @xmath35 , 0.6 and 1.2 and normalize with that obtained for @xmath36 , assuming that for @xmath37 , the surface composition is the same as dictated by the stoichiometry .",
    "thus obtained ratio @xmath38 from the fitting procedure are plotted in inset  ii as open circles with error bars .",
    "we also plot the expected ratio ( solid line ) in the same inset as a function of the nominal bulk compositions for all @xmath32 .",
    "the plot exhibits a good agreement between the experimental and the expected values .",
    "this clearly suggests that the surface composition in this system remains close to that of the bulk without any complication arising from surface non - stoichiometry or segregation .",
    "the se  3@xmath7 spectra for the entire composition range is shown in the main panel of fig .  2 .",
    "the spectral features are broad without any clear indication of the expected spin - orbit split doublet ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) signals .",
    "our analysis of the spectral line shape suggests it to be incompatible with a single type of se atoms in the system , since the spectral shape could not be simulated by a single set of spin - orbit doublet .",
    "it is reasonable to expect the presence of two types of se atoms in nis@xmath0se@xmath1 .",
    "these two types of se atoms are distinguished by the bonded partner within the dimer unit , since one would in general expect ( se - se)@xmath41 , ( se - s)@xmath41 as well as ( s - s)@xmath41 units to be present in samples with @xmath42 in the nis@xmath0se@xmath1 series .",
    "raman spectroscopy @xcite has been used to identify the presence of bond stretching vibrations of s - s , s - se and se - se molecular units in agreement with this point of view .",
    "however , the relative abundance of each of these three types of dimers in any sample of given @xmath2 is not known so far . since the nearest neighbor chemical environment of se in ( se - se)@xmath41 is different from se in ( se - s)@xmath41 dimers ,",
    "the two types of se are expected to have different binding energies arising from chemical shifts in the core level spectra .",
    "thus , we attempt to describe the spectra with two distinct se  3@xmath7 spin - orbit split doublets . in inset",
    "i , the two components obtained for @xmath43 along with the experimental data and the resulting fit are shown as an example .",
    "the resulting fits to the experimental spectra are shown as solid lines in the main panel of fig .",
    "2 , exhibiting good agreement for all @xmath2 . the observed chemical shift of about 1.0  ev between the two types of se sites ,",
    "was found to be the same in all the samples .",
    "it is easy to estimate the expected intensity ratio from these two types of se sites assuming a random substitution of s atoms by se in nis@xmath0se@xmath1 ; this is given by the statistical ratio , @xmath44 . in inset  ii , we plot experimentally and theoretically obtained intensity ratios between se - se and se - s pairs ( open circles and solid line respectively ) against the respective se content ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "we find a remarkable agreement between the two , indicating that the se substitution is indeed random in these samples .",
    "we now turn to the ni  2@xmath26 core level spectrum which often manifests distinct spectral signatures arising from various many - body interactions .",
    "ni  2@xmath26 spectrum in nis@xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) consists of spin - orbit split , @xmath45 and @xmath46 peaks at 853.5  ev and 871  ev binding energies , respectively , with pronounced satellite features around 860  ev and 876  ev , indicating the presence of electron correlations in the system .",
    "the satellite intensity relative to the main peak appears considerably more intense in the @xmath46 region compared to that in the @xmath45 region . in order to determine the inelastic scattering background , we have performed electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) on these samples , with the same primary energy as that of the ni  @xmath47 core level peak . using a procedure that have been previously employed @xcite , the inelastic background function obtained for nis@xmath3",
    "is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "3 , as a dotted line .",
    "we find that there is an intense and structured contribution from the background function overlapping the @xmath46 satellite region , resulting in the anomalously large satellite intensity in the @xmath46 region compared to that in the @xmath45 region ; this feature in the inelastic scattering spectrum of nis@xmath3 arises from a plasmon band .",
    "it is also seen that at about 857  ev , there is a peak - like structure in the inelastic background ; this appears at about the same energy position as that of the strong asymmetry in the line shape of the @xmath45 main peak .",
    "this structure in the inelastic scattering background could have its origin from the inter - band @xmath48 transitions .",
    "we have calculated ni  @xmath47 core level and valence band ( vb ) spectra of nis@xmath3 within the same model involving a nis@xmath25 cluster to obtain quantitative many - body description of the electronic structure . in this calculation for ni@xmath49 , the electron - electron interaction parameters , @xmath50  ev ,",
    "@xmath51  ev , @xmath52  ev , @xmath53  ev , and @xmath54  ev were used . the calculated ni  @xmath47 spectrum with the hopping interaction strength @xmath55 , the charge transfer energy ( @xmath56 ) and coulomb interaction strength ( @xmath57 ) being -1.5  ev , 2.0  ev and 4.0  ev , respectively , is shown in the main figure by a solid line overlapping the experimental spectrum ( open circles ) .",
    "the calculated spectrum includes the experimentally determined inelastic background , shown in the inset .",
    "there is evidently a good agreement between the experimental and the calculated spectrum .",
    "the calculated discrete spectrum arising from this finite - sized cluster calculation without any broadening is also presented as a stick diagram in the main panel .",
    "the present results show that it is necessary to take into account the contributions to the experimental spectrum from the extrinsic loss processes in order to provide a proper quantitative description of the spectrum .",
    "the previous estimates of various parameter strengths in nis@xmath3 obtained from a model that included a `` conduction band '' in addition to the ni  3@xmath7-s  3@xmath26 basis within the cluster model for the core level calculation @xcite , are @xmath58  ev , @xmath59  ev , and @xmath60  ev . thus , the present estimates differ significantly for both @xmath55 and @xmath57 , where we have a larger estimate for @xmath55 and a smaller value for the @xmath57 .",
    "however , the @xmath55 values estimated for nis@xmath3 in the present case is similar to that estimated for other divalent nickel sulphides , for example , @xmath61  ev for nis @xcite and -1.5  ev for banis@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "additionally , as we show later in the text , the present estimates are also consistent with the valence band spectrum .",
    "the charge transfer energy , @xmath56 , varies considerably for different sulphides of nickel , with nis@xmath3 having a @xmath56 of 2  ev compared to 2.5  ev for nis and 1.0  ev for banis@xmath3 @xcite . in general , @xmath56 is expected to be smaller for sulphides compared to oxides , since the o  @xmath47 levels are energetically more stable than the s  @xmath62 levels ; for example , the estimated @xmath56 for nio is 5.5  ev @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath57 in nis@xmath3 is found to be the same as that in nis @xcite , while in the case of banis@xmath3 , @xmath57 estimated is still smaller ( @xmath63  ev ) @xcite , possibly arising from a more efficient screening in the metallic system due to a smaller @xmath56 and slightly large @xmath55 values .",
    "the ground state wavefunction of nis@xmath3 corresponding to the estimated parameter strengths have been analyzed in terms of contributions from various electron configurations .",
    "the ground state of the system was found to consist of 61.6% , 35.1% and 3.3% of @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 configurations with a high - spin configuration ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the average value of the @xmath68occupancy @xmath69 is found to be 8.42 , showing a highly covalent ground state of the system , which is very similar to that obtained for nis ( 8.43 ) @xcite and banis@xmath3 ( 8.48 ) @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed the characters of the final states of the system responsible for the different features in the experimental spectrum in order to understand their origins .",
    "the analysis was carried out for some of the representative final state energies marked 1 - 10 in fig .",
    "the different contributions to the final states from various electron configurations ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) are listed in table .",
    "i. these features can be grouped into three different regions ; the main peak region , 852 - 856  ev ( labelled 1 - 4 ) ; intense satellite region , 859 - 862  ev ( labelled 5 - 8 ) , and weak satellites in the region of 864 - 867  ev ( labelled 9 and 10 ) .",
    "the first group of features in the main peak region has a dominant @xmath65 character as seen from the table , which are the ` well - screened ' states of the system , corresponding to one ligand ( sulphur ) electron being transferred to the ni site to screen the attractive potential of the ni  @xmath47 core - hole created by the photoemission process .",
    "this is similar to the observations from previous studies in the charge transfer systems , where @xmath65 states are stabilized compared to the other configurations giving rise to the intense main peak .",
    "the second group of features have a mixed character with significant contributions from all the configurations .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of nio where the intense satellite structure results primarily from the @xmath64 configuration , establishing that the satellite in the ni 2@xmath26 core spectrum in nis@xmath3 can not be described as a poorly screened state . such heavily mixed characters of the satellites have been shown to exist for intermetallic compounds of th @xcite . for the third group of features ,",
    "the primary contribution comes from both @xmath64 and @xmath70 contributions with relatively lower contributions coming from @xmath66 character .    in fig .  4",
    ", we show the experimental xp valence band spectrum ( open circles ) along with the calculated spectrum ( solid line ) using the same model .",
    "as mentioned before , we have used the s  3@xmath26 partial dos obtained from the band structure calculation to represent the s  3@xmath26 contribution to the valence band spectrum .",
    "it was also found necessary to shift rigidly the s  3@xmath26 partial dos by about 0.9  ev to higher binding energy in order to match the experimentally observed s  3@xmath26 features .",
    "the various contributions to the calculated spectrum , ni  @xmath71 ( dashed line ) and s  @xmath62 ( dot - dash line ) are shown along with the experimental data in fig .",
    "an inelastic scattering background function ( dotted lines ) is also included in the total calculated spectrum . the calculated discrete contributions from the ni  @xmath71 to the total spectrum for nis@xmath3 are also shown without any broadening effects as a stick diagram in fig .",
    "the parameter set used for the valence band calculation is identical to that used for the core level calculation . in view of the fact that no parameter was adjusted to obtain a fit ,",
    "the agreement between the experimental spectrum and the calculated one is remarkable over the entire energy range .",
    "the increasing intensity in the experimental spectrum beyond 11  ev is due to s  3@xmath24 level with a peak at about 14  ev . there are two distinct sets of parameters proposed earlier on the basis of valence band analysis .",
    "fujimori @xcite obtained @xmath72  ev , @xmath73  ev and @xmath74  ev , while sangaletti @xcite arrived at @xmath75  ev , @xmath76  ev and @xmath77  ev .",
    "good agreement between the experimental spectrum and the calculated one in the present study ( see fig .  4 ) over the entire range with a minimum number of parameters , indicates the reliability of the parameter set estimated here .",
    "this is further enhanced by the fact that the same set of parameters also provides an equally satisfactory description of the core level spectrum ( see fig .",
    "we note that previous estimates in ref .",
    "@xcite is in better agreement with the present results , with the ref .",
    "@xcite arriving at a too high an estimate for @xmath56 and too low an estimate for @xmath55 .",
    "the main peak region in the valance band spectrum at about 2.3  ev arises essentially from ni  3@xmath7 photoemission contribution though there is a small contribution arising from s  3@xmath26 states also due to hybridization mixing of ni  3@xmath7 and s  3@xmath26 states .",
    "the features at 3.5  ev and 7.5  ev are contributed primarily by the s  3@xmath26 contributions . as the same model and same parameters",
    "were used for the vb calculation of nis@xmath3 , the ground state of the system was the same as that described in the core level calculation .",
    "the results of the character analysis of the final states labelled 1 - 11 in fig .",
    "4 are shown in table .",
    "the spectral features can be grouped into three regions , the main peak region ( 0 - 3.5  ev , labelled 1 - 4 ) , the spectral features in the 5 - 7  ev range ( labelled 5 - 7 ) and satellites beyond 8.5  ev ( marked 8 - 11 ) .",
    "the final states in the main peak region predominantly consist of @xmath78 states with non - negligible contributions from @xmath79 and @xmath80 configurations .",
    "this is similar to the case of other charge - transfer systems , like nio  @xcite . in",
    "the 5 - 7  ev spectral region , the final states have very similar character as that in the main peak region , with the contributions from @xmath78 further enhanced at the expense of contributions from @xmath80 and @xmath81 states .",
    "the satellite features at higher energies ( marked 8 - 11 ) are dominated by @xmath80 and @xmath79 configurations with little contributions from other configurations .",
    "as these satellite features have dominant @xmath80 character , these could be attributed to the spectral signature of the lower hubbard band in the system . however , these features are not distinct in the experimental spectrum due to their weak intensities .",
    "we now turn to the results obtained from the solid solution nis@xmath0se@xmath1 in order to address the changing electronic structure observed with increasing @xmath2 in the series .",
    "the ni  @xmath47 core level spectra for the entire series are shown in the main panel of fig .",
    "5 . for all the compositions the spectra appear to be quite similar",
    ", though there are some subtle differences between the spectra with different se contents .",
    "the spectra for @xmath82 , 0.6 and 1.2 are overlapped in the inset of fig .  5 for the 2@xmath30 region .",
    "as the se content increases , the 2@xmath30 level narrows , consistent with the previous report @xcite . in this comparison",
    ", the satellite intensity relative to the main peak intensity appears to decrease marginally as @xmath2 increases .",
    "this apparent decrease of the satellite intensity is essentially compensated by the narrowing of the main peak , such that the integrated satellite intensity relative to the main peak integrated intensity remains essentially the same . from the core level analysis",
    ", we see that the intensity of the satellite peak is sensitive to the value of @xmath4 .",
    "hence , on the basis of the insensitivity of the satellite intensity , we conclude that all electronic interaction strengths , and in particular the on - site coulomb interaction strength @xmath4 , do not change significantly across the composition range studied ; the same calculated result , as shown in fig",
    ".  3 , can explain the different core level spectra in fig .  5 equally well with slight adjustments of the broadening functions .",
    "the xp valence band spectra of nis@xmath0se@xmath1 for @xmath83 , 0.6 , 0.8 and 1.2 recorded using al k@xmath23 are shown in fig .",
    "6 . as @xmath2 increases ,",
    "the various features marked ( a , b , and c ) become more evident in the xp spectra ; additionally , the separation between the features a and b increases across the series . as @xmath2 increases",
    ", the se  4@xmath26 contribution to the vb increases and the changes in feature c can be attributed to this . as the features",
    "a and b are dominated by ni  3@xmath7 states , the spectral changes suggest some subtle modifications in the electronic structure , which is presumably also responsible for the change in the ground state properties with @xmath2 , namely the insulator - metal transition .",
    "however , such effects can not be treated within the minimal cluster model considered here and more sophisticated approaches like dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite are required to study the detailed electronic structure near @xmath20 . within the resolution limit of xps , we do not see any dramatic changes in the valence band spectrum near @xmath20 , across the series . even for the bulk insulating nis@xmath3 ,",
    "there is a finite intensity at @xmath20 and this could be due to the resolution broadening , but also might have some contribution coming from the surface metallic layer @xcite .",
    "however , there is an indication of an increased intensity at @xmath20 with increasing @xmath2 , consistent with the increase in the metallicity of the solid solution .",
    "the metal - insulator transition in nis@xmath0se@xmath1 series is an issue which have been studied extensively , however , still not understood completely .",
    "our study reveals that the on - site coulomb interaction in the system does not change with the increase in the se substitution .",
    "this is consistent with the suggestion of nis@xmath3 and nise@xmath3 having similar @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "moreover , band structure studies @xcite reveal that the effective ni  @xmath7 band width ( @xmath5 ) increases in going from nis@xmath3 to nise@xmath3 .",
    "thus , as a result of the increase in @xmath5 , the effective correlation strength ( @xmath84 ) decreases , driving the system metallic for @xmath2 above @xmath11 .",
    "the estimated values of @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath4 ( -1.5  ev , 2.0  ev and 4.0  ev , respectively ) , places nis@xmath3 in the regime of covalent insulators,@xcite close to @xmath6-metals .",
    "as se is substituted in place of s , the system moves in to the @xmath6-metallic regime , driven by the decrease in @xmath85 , resulting in the bulk metal - insulator transition in the system .    in conclusion",
    ", we have investigated the electronic structure of nis@xmath0se@xmath1 system using x - ray photoemission spectroscopy .",
    "the analysis of the s  2@xmath26 and se  3@xmath7 spectra revealed the homogeneity of the samples , without any segregation or non - stoichiometry .",
    "the electronic structure of nis@xmath3 has been studied by means of a parameterized multi - band cluster model and is found to be successful in describing the core level and valence band spectra within the same model and an identical parameter set .",
    "these calculations show that nis@xmath3 is a strongly correlated system with a highly covalent character .",
    "it is found that the on - site coulomb interaction strength ( @xmath4 ) does not change with the se substitution and the system transforms from the covalent insulator regime to a @xmath6-metallic type , due to the enhanced bandwidth resulting from the substitution of s by se .",
