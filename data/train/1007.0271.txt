    "crystalline solids typically exhibit local non - affine deformations when driven by external stresses . in many instances these non - affine deformations",
    "can be described in terms of a density of dislocations , however such a description is problematic when the density of dislocations is large enough that their cores overlap @xcite . since the overlapping cores of the dislocations have the character of a fluid , it has been suggested that these excitations should be thought of as fluid - like droplets @xcite .",
    "this has proved a useful interpretation , especially since amorphous solids , for which dislocations are difficult to define , also show such localized deformations under shear .    just as dislocations in a solid can be thermally excited in the absence of external drive ,",
    "it is reasonable to ask whether these fluid - like droplet fluctuations@xcite can arise in the absence of external perturbation , especially when close to the fluid - solid phase boundary .",
