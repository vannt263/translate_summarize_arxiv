    "blazars are the most extreme subclass of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . their radiation are thought to originate in a relativistic jet oriented at a small angle with respect to the line of the sight .",
    "they usually show strong and rapid variability , high and variable polarization , and super - luminal motions , etc .",
    "the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of blazars are dominated by non - thermal emission and consist of two distinct , broad components .",
    "it is generally agreed that the low component of their seds is produced by synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons , while the origin of high energy component is still a matter of debate .",
    "there are two classes of models to explain high energy emission : leptonic model and hadronic model . in the leptonic model ,",
    "the high energy emission is produced by inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of the soft photon fields ( e.g. , bttcher 2007 ) , in which soft photons are the synchrotron photons within the jet ( the ssc process ; maraschi et al .",
    "1992 ; bloom and marscher 1996 ) or the photons external to jet ( the ec process ) .",
    "these external photons are the uv accretion disk photons @xcite or the accretion disk photons reprocessed by broad line region clouds @xcite or the infrared photons from the dust torus @xcite . in the hadronic model",
    ", the high energy emission originates from proton synchrotron or photon - hadronic interaction @xcite .",
    "a way to distinguish the different emission models is to study variability of blazars .",
    "the one - zone ssc model predicts a significant x - ray/@xmath0-ray correlation .",
    "however , the hadronic model is challenged by the observed x - ray/@xmath0-ray correlation and very rapid @xmath0-ray variability .",
    "mrk 421 is a high frequency peaked bl lac object ( hbl ) and at a redshift of z=0.03 .",
    "it is one of the closest and brightest sources in the extragalactic tev sky .",
    "it is the first extragalactic tev source @xcite and has been targeted by many multi - wavelength campaigns .",
    "mrk 421 is a highly variable source and show strong variability in both x - ray and @xmath0-ray bands .",
    "the synchrotron peak of its sed ranges from 0.1kev in a low state to several kev in a high state .",
    "in general , the spectrum becomes harder with increasing flux level in both x - ray and @xmath0-ray bands @xcite .",
    "in addition , the spectral index changes during different active states and shows an evident correlation with flux @xcite .",
    "some observations have been revealed that mrk 421 shows the hard and soft lag in the x - ray band @xcite .",
    "the correlation of x - ray and @xmath0-ray fluxes were found @xcite , supporting the x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission may originate from the same electron population , while no apparent correlation of optical and x - ray appeared @xcite , indicating the optical and x - ray radiation may arise from the different electron population .",
    "the rapid flares in both x - ray and @xmath0-ray can help us to understand the particle acceleration and emission process in blazars .",
    "first - order fermi process may play an important role in accelerating the jet electrons @xcite .",
    "the electrons in the jet of mrk 421 are likely to be accelerated by a first - order fermi mechanism at the shock front and then form a power - law energy spectrum with the index of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "several authors also pointed out that the stochastic acceleration could be at work in blazar jets @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that the rapid tev flares in mrk 501 could be caused by the stochastic acceleration .",
    "it is likely that several acceleration mechanism are at work in blazar jets @xcite .    motivated by above results , we study the flares of mrk 421 on 2008 june 6 - 15 , in which no significant correlation between optical and x - ray / tev bands is observed .",
    "we assume that the multi - band emission originates from two different components .",
    "one is the steady component from the out region to produce the optical emission , in which the electrons are accelerated by first - order fermi process .",
    "the other is the variable component from the inner region , in which the electrons are accelerated by stochastic process .",
    "the observed flares are produced by the hardening of the electron spectrum under the process of stochastic acceleration . in the section 2",
    "we describe the basic option of the model . in the section 3",
    "we apply the model to mrk 421 .",
    "the discussion and conclusion are presented in the session 4 . throughout this paper , we adopt the cosmological parameters of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "we use the conventional ssc model to produce the emission from the steady component . first - order fermi acceleration can produce a paw - law electron energy spectrum . we assume the electron spectrum with the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the normalization factor in the unit of @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the minimum and maximum energies of electrons in the blob , and @xmath10 is the energy spectral index of electrons . throughout the paper ,",

    "the klein - nishina ( kn ) effect is important at high energy and obviously modifies the electron and the ssc spectra @xcite .",
    "we calculate the ic cooling rate using the method of @xcite , which takes into account the kn correction @xmath60 where @xmath61 is given by the equation ( 3 ) and @xmath62 is approximated as @xcite @xmath63    to obtain the electron energy distribution , equation 5 needs to be solved by a numerical method because of its nonlinearity .",
    "we adopt a very useful numerical difference scheme proposed by @xcite .",
    "the method is a finite difference scheme , which uses the forward differentiation in time and the centered differentiation in energy .",
    "we test our code by comparing our results with the analytic solution given by @xcite .",

    "mrk 421 entered a very active phase and showed frequent flare episodes in 2008 .",
    "@xcite presented the optical , x - ray , and very high energy @xmath0-ray observation of mrk 421 between may 24 and june 23 of 2008 with webt , uvot , rxte / asm , swift , agile , veritas and magic .",

    "two flare states are reported during this period .",
    "one is the low state on june 6 observed from optical to tev gamma - ray .",
    "the one is the high state on june 9 - 15 observed from optical to mev gamma - ray , in which the flux increases and the spectrum becomes harder .",
    "unfortunately , there are no tev data included in this multi - wavelength compaign after june 8 because the moonlight hampers the cherenkov telescope measurements .",
    "however , @xcite complemented the vhe observation in the high state by the argo - ybj experiment on june 11 - 13 .",
    "we use the multiwavelenth data collected by @xcite in june 6 - 15 .",

    "no significant correlation is observed between x/@xmath0-rays and the optical band which usually shows a steady flux .",
    "we argue that the emission may contain two components from two different jet regions .",
    "one is the steady component from the outer region , in which the electrons are accelerated by first - order fermi process .",
    "we use the conventional ssc model to produce the emission from the steady component .",
    "the first - order fermi acceleration is expected to create a steady electron spectrum with spectral index 2.2 , we set @xmath68 to fit the sed of mrk 421 , in which the parameters are listed in table 1 . the other is the variable component from the inner region , in which the low energy electrons are continuously injected into blob and then accelerated to the high energy by the stochastic acceleration . in our calculations , we assume a constant initial electron distribution @xmath69 for @xmath54 .",
    "we use the time - dependent ssc model to produce the emission from the variable component , in which the parameters are listed in table 2 .",
    "the model sed of mrk 421 is shown in figure 2 .",
    "it shows that our model can well fit the seds of mrk 421 .    in figure 1",
    ", we show the electron spectra of two flare states used in our sed fits .",
    "it is obvious that the ic cooling modifies the electron spectrum in the high energy and the electron spectrum is softer than that in the case of only synchrotron cooling .",
    "nevertheless , the electron spectrum does not change at the low - energy end and becomes harder at the high - energy end from the low state to the high state , indicating that the flares are due to the hardening of the electron spectrum at the high energy .",
    "the short time variability ( @xmath70 day ) constrains the size of the emitting region to be @xmath71 .",
    "the mean energy @xmath72 of synchrotron radiation from an electron with lorentz factor @xmath73 is @xmath74 .",
    "the peak energy of synchrotron radiation is @xmath75 kev during this flare , corresponding to @xmath76 , which is comparable with the peak of the electron spectrum we used ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the parameter of @xmath77 indicates that the ic scattering occurs at the kn regime during the two flares .",
    "we can estimate the doppler factor @xmath16 by the kn effect .",
    "when the energy of the electron has @xmath78 , the ic scattering takes place at the kn regime , leading to a peak in the ic luminosity at @xmath79 .",
    "we can obtain that @xmath80 .",
    "we have @xmath81 kev and @xmath82 tev in the low state and obtain @xmath83 that is very close to the value we used .",
    "the physical parameters we used in the inner region are very similar to that of @xcite .",
    "it is indicated that a high doppler factor is required to reproduce the observed sed @xcite .",
    "we can estimate the power carried by the jet in the form of poynting flux ( @xmath84 ) , relativistic electrons ( @xmath85 ) and cold protons ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "all powers are calculated as @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath88 @xmath89 is the energy density of the i component as measured in the co - moving frame .",
    "the electron energy density is given by @xmath90 .",
    "the ratio of electron number density to proton number density in blazar jets is of the order of 0.1 - 1 @xcite .",
    "we calculate the proton energy density @xmath91 by assuming one proton per emitting electron .",
    "the power carried by the radiation is @xcite @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the radiation energy density produced by the jet .",
    "@xmath94 is the total observed non - thermal luminosity .",
    "we set @xmath95 by assuming the viewing angle @xmath96 .",
    "@xmath97 is the equipartition parameter between the magnetic and electron energy density .",
    "the estimated powers are listed in table 3 . in both regions",
    ", we find that the electron energy density is slightly larger than the magnetic field energy density , and they are close to equipartition , typically @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "because the radiated power is far less than the total jet power , the substantial fraction of the total jet power is carried by the proton , indicating that the jet is strongly matter - dominated .",
    "@xcite analyzed the optical and x - ray variability of mrk 421 , they suggested that the inner region would produce the x - ray .",
    "however outer region only could produce lower - frequency emission .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the one - zone ssc model couldt fit the optical and radio fluxes well .",
    "they argued that the optical and radio radiation could originate in another region further down the jet , which is consistent with the fact that the optical flux has small change compared to the fluxes in the x - ray and @xmath0-ray bands .",
    "moreover , a two - component model is used to explain the multiwavelength variability of mrk 421 @xcite .",
    "a two - component model is seemly needed to explain the multi - wavelength seds of mrk 421 , supported by the lack of correlation between the optical and x - ray bands .    in the paper , we study the x - ray and @xmath0-ray flares of mrk 421 on 2008 june 6 - 15 using the ssc model with electron acceleration .",
    "we suggest that the low - energy electron population from the outer region is produced via first - order fermi acceleration , and the high - energy electron population is related to the stochastic acceleration .",
    "the x - ray observations with suzaku also implied that the emission from mrk 421 may originate from two different electron populations , which may be produced by fist - order fermi and second - order fermi processes @xcite .",
    "we reproduce the observed seds of mrk 421 from the low state to the high state using a two - component model .",
    "we obtain an excellent fit to the observed spectrum of mrk 421 based on our model .",
    "@xcite used a steady electron spectrum to reproduce the observed seds of mrk 421 , and pointed out that the flares are due to the softing / hardening of electron spectrum , not due to the increase / decrease of the electron density .",
    "however , they didt explain what acceleration mechanism leads to the softing / hardening of electron spectrum .",
    "we argue that the flares are due to the hardening of electron spectrum at the high energy under the process of stochastic acceleration . in our model ,",
    "the electrons with low energy are assumed to be continuously injected into the blob and are then accelerated to the higher energy by stochastic acceleration , which leads to the hardening of the electron spectrum and then causes the x - ray and @xmath0-ray flares by the ssc process .",
    "@xcite also suggested that the x - ray flares of mrk 421 are due to the intrinsic changes in the acceleration process , which is consistent with our results .",
    "furthermore , the observed peaks of synchrotron and ic components shift toward the higher frequency from the low state to the high state , supporting that the flares are driven by the process of the electron acceleration .",
    "we estimate the jet powers using our model parameters in both jet regions .",
    "we find that the energy densities of electrons and magnetic field are near equipartition and the jet is strongly matter - dominated in both jet regions .",
    "a hint of correlation between optical and tev energy was reported by @xcite , but no clear correlation between the optical and x/@xmath0-ray bands is confirmed so far .",
