    "an understanding of the contact angle of micro- and nano - droplets and bubbles is an urgent necessity , as it is related to the analysis and development of various micro- and nano - devices based on droplets and bubbles  @xcite . in particular , the wetting and drying strategies borrowed from biological structures have potential for the development and design of new materials following the design principle known as biomimetics  @xcite .",
    "when a droplet wets a substrate , the line tension  @xcite at the three - phase contact line should play some role in determining the morphology of the droplet .",
    "the line tension is particularly important for nanoscale droplets , as the magnitude of the line tension is quite small  @xcite .",
    "it has already been pointed out that the line tension plays a fundamental role in the stability of a non volatile droplet  @xcite and in the heterogeneous nucleation of a volatile droplet  @xcite on a flat substrate .",
    "however , the line - tension effect has been primarily considered on a flat substrate  @xcite .",
    "there have been almost no theoretical or experimental attempts to clarify the line - tension effects on various substrates with complex geometries except for a very small number of studies done on the line - tension effect on a _ convex _ spherical substrate  @xcite .",
    "the number of studies done on _ concave _ substrates is even smaller  @xcite , though they play important role in various phenomena such as heterogeneous nucleation  @xcite , wetting of a structured surface  @xcite and so on .    in this paper",
    ", we will consider the relationship between the line tension and the morphology of a droplet and a bubble placed on an inner wall of a spherical cavity . since the volume of the cavity is fixed , the droplet and bubble can be studied on the same footing .",
    "we will mainly consider the droplet of a nonvolatile liquid .",
    "we extend our previous work  @xcite on a volatile liquid and consider the line - tension effects on the morphology of a lens - shaped droplet of a non - volatile liquid placed on the bottom of a spherical cavity .",
    "this problem is equivalent to that of a lens - shaped bubble attached to the top of the inner wall of a spherical cavity .",
    "we find again a special role played by the equator of the concave spherical cavity , which was found previously for a droplet placed on a convex spherical substrate  @xcite .",
    "when the contact line is on the upper hemisphere , it can not cross the equator continuously to move into the lower hemisphere by increasing the magnitude of the negative line tension , and vice versa .",
    "a droplet whose contact line coincides with the equator of the cavity is a special case .",
    "the contact line is fixed at the equator and can not move even if the magnitude of the positive and negative line tension is altered .",
    "in contrast to a flat substrate where only the drying transition is expected for the positive line tension , we observe the wetting transition in addition to the drying transition  @xcite by increasing the positive line tension when the contact line does not coincide with the equator . more specifically , the droplet will form a spherical droplet in the drying transition and it will spread over the whole wall of the inner substrate of the cavity to leave a spherical bubble in the wetting transition . in this paper , we will use the terminologies `` wetting / drying transitions '' although they are really the finite - size wetting / drying transitions because the size of liquid droplet is finite . in section",
    "ii , we will formulate the line tension effect on the helmholtz free energy and the contact angle derived from the minimization of the free energy . in section iii",
    ", we will discuss the scenario of the morphological transition outlined above using the mathematically rigorous formulation of section ii .",
    "we will conclude in section iv .",
    "in our previous work  @xcite , we considered the line - tension effects on a critical droplet of a volatile liquid heterogeneously nucleated on convex and concave spherical substrates and calculated the gibbs free energy , which is appropriate for studying the activation energy of nucleation . in this study , we focus on the physics of the line tension on a lens - shaped droplet of a non - volatile liquid placed on a spherical concave substrate of a spherical cavity , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cc1 ] .",
    "we consider a droplet of a non - volatile liquid with radius @xmath2 and contact angle @xmath3 , placed on the bottom of the inner wall of a spherical cavity of radius @xmath4 .",
    "the droplet volume @xmath5 is held constant and , therefore , the radius @xmath2 depends on the contact angle @xmath3 .",
    "we use the so - called _ capillary model _ , where the structure and width of the interfaces are neglected and the liquid - vapor , liquid - sold , and solid - vapor interactions are accounted for by the curvature - independent surface tensions .",
    "although any axial - symmetric droplet with non - spherical surface will be possible  @xcite , in particular , when the liquid - substrate molecular interaction or the disjoining pressure is important  @xcite , we will concentrate on the spherical lens - shaped droplet in this work for the first step towards the understanding of the line - tension effect on the droplet in cavity .",
    "once the molecular interaction becomes important and can not be neglected , the line tension is not a constant but depends on the disjoining pressure  @xcite and the geometries of droplet and substrate .",
    "it is also well known that the surface tension depends on the curvature of the surface  @xcite .",
    "for example , the liquid - vapor surface tension @xmath6 depend on the radius @xmath2 of the surface as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the first order correction term known as the `` tolman length '' .",
    "although tolman  @xcite himself suggested that @xmath8 is of the order of a molecular diameter and positive for droplet , the subsequent works  @xcite revealed that @xmath8 is much smaller than the molecular diameter .",
    "therefore , the curvature dependence of the surface tension can be neglected as far as we consider a droplet of nano- and micro - scale size .",
    "as has been noted in the previous publication  @xcite , the line tension must also be curvature dependent ; otherwise , the force balance condition will be unphysical for a small droplet with @xmath9 .",
    "again , we will neglect the curvature - dependence of line tension since we consider a droplet with a finite size .",

    "the meniscus of a droplet can be convex , concave or flat depending on the magnitude of the contact angle @xmath3 .",
    "the contact angle @xmath11 for a flat substrate is determined from the implicit equation @xmath17 for the droplet volume @xmath5 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cc1 ] , we show the three types of meniscus when the contact line coincides with the equator of the cavity . in this case , the contact angle @xmath18 is fixed and not affected by the presence of line tension , which will be discussed later . if @xmath10 , the meniscus becomes concave ( fig .",

    "in addition to these three types of droplet , whose contact lines coincide with the equator as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cc1 ] , we expect eight different types of droplet morphology , as shown in fig .  [ fig : cc2 ] :    1 .   a spherical droplet with @xmath21 ( dr ) . as a result",

    "2 .   a spherical bubble with @xmath22 ( bb ) . as a result",

    "3 .   a lens - shaped droplet with a concave meniscus ( @xmath23 ) whose contact line is on the upper hemisphere ( lcu ) .",

    "7 .   a lens - shaped droplet with a flat meniscus whose contact line is on the lower hemisphere ( lfl ) . 8 .   a lens - shaped droplet with a flat meniscus whose contact line is on the upper hemisphere ( lfu )",
    "apparently , the droplet with a flat meniscus is the boundary case between a concave and a convex meniscus .",

    "<S> the effects of line tension on the morphology of a lens - shaped droplet and bubble placed on the inner wall of a spherical cavity are studied . </S>",
    "<S> the contact angle between the lens - shaped droplet and the concave spherical substrate is expressed by the generalized young s formula . </S>",
    "<S> the equator of the spherical substrate is found to play a crucial role . neither a droplet with its contact line on the upper hemisphere of the substrate nor one with its contact line on the lower hemisphere can transform into each other continuously . on a hydrophobic substrate , </S>",
    "<S> the contact angle jumps discontinuously to @xmath0 , and the droplet is detached from the substrate to form a spherical droplet when the line tension is positive and large . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to the drying transition on a flat substrate . on the other hand , on a hydrophilic substrate , </S>",
    "<S> the contact angle jumps discontinuously to @xmath1 when the line tension is positive and large . </S>",
    "<S> then , the droplet spread over the whole inner wall to leave a spherical bubble . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , not only the drying transition but also the wetting transition is induced by positive line tension on a concave spherical substrate . </S>",
    "<S> there also exist stable as well as metastable droplets , whose phase diagrams can be complex . when the line tension is negative and its magnitude increases , the contact line approaches the equator infinitesimally from either above or below . however , it can not cross the equator of a spherical cavity continuously . the droplet with a contact line that coincides with the equator </S>",
    "<S> is a singular droplet . </S>",
    "<S> the contact line is pinned and can not move , irrespective of the magnitude of the line tension . </S>"
