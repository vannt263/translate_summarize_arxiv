    "measuring strange and multi - strange particle production in relativistic heavy - ion interactions give a unique insight into the properties of the hot and dense matter created in the collision , as there is no net strangeness content in the initially colliding nuclei .",
    "moreover , the high energy and luminosity available at the lhc grant a relative abundant production of such particles .",
    "an enhanced production of strange particles in compared to pp interactions was one of the earliest proposed signatures of the formation of a deconfined quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite . in collisions , the production of strange particles is limited by the local canonical strangeness conservation .",
    "this is not the case in central heavy - ion collisions , where strange quarks are expected to be produced more abundantly , resulting in an enhanced production of strange baryons at the end of the hadronisation stage .",
    "strangeness enhancement in heavy - ion collisions with respect to ( ) has been observed in collisions at the na57 experiment @xcite , at star @xcite in collisions , and indeed confirmed by alice in central collisions at @xcite .",
    "one of the most striking differences between the and collisions first observed at rhic was the suppression of the hadron production at high transverse momentum ( @xmath2 ) in central collisions at @xmath3 = when compared to expectations from an incoherent superposition of nucleon - nucleon interactions @xcite .",
    "the effect , confirmed by the charged - particle nuclear modification factor ( @xmath4 ) as a function of @xmath2 measured in collisions at the lhc @xcite , is interpreted as the result of the energy loss suffered by partons when traversing the hot and dense matter created in an ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collision .",
    "the larger suppression observed at lhc compared to that at rhic can be explained by the higher density of the medium created in collisions at higher centre - of - mass energy .",
    "the alice detector was designed to study heavy - ion physics at the lhc .",
    "it consists of a central barrel with a large solenoid providing a field for tracking and particle identification and forward detectors for triggering and centrality selection .",
    "tracking and vertexing are performed using the inner tracking system ( its ) , consisting of six layers of silicon detectors , and the time projection chamber ( tpc ) .",
    "the two innermost layers of the its and the v0 detector ( scintillation hodoscopes placed on either side of the interaction region ) are used for triggering .",
    "the v0 also provides the centrality determination in collisions as well as the multiplicity class selection in collisions .",
    "a complete description of the alice sub - detectors can be found in @xcite .",
    "multi - strange baryons are reconstructed through their weak decay topologies , namely , ( with ) , and the corresponding charge conjugate decays for the anti - particles .",
    "the branching ratios are 63.9% and 43.3% , for the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 candidates are found by combining reconstructed charged tracks : cuts on geometry and kinematics are applied to first select the @xmath5 candidate and then to match it with all the remaining secondary tracks ( bachelor candidates ) .",
    "in addition , particle identification is performed by a selection on the specific energy loss in the tpc for the three daughter tracks .",
    "the strangeness enhancement is defined as the ratio between the yields in collisions and those in interactions at the same energy , both normalized to the mean number of participants ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the measured enhancement for multi - strange baryons is shown in figure [ fig-1]a and [ fig-1]b as a function of @xmath6 : it increases with centrality and with the strangeness content of the particle as already observed at lower energies , and decreases as the centre - of - mass energy increases , continuing the trend established between sps and rhic energies .",
    "an alternative way to look at the strangeness enhancement , in order to factor out the general increase in multiplicity with _ _ n__@xmath7 from the actual increase in strange particle production is to study the hyperon - to - pion ratios , namely and , for and pp collisions .",
    "these ratios are shown in figure [ fig-1]c as a function of @xmath6 , both at lhc and rhic energies .",
    "the relative production of strangeness in pp collisions at the lhc is larger than at rhic energy while it is almost the same at the two energies for collisions .",
    "the decrease of enhancement with increasing energy is then caused by the change in collisions , in agreement with the hypothesis of progressive relaxing of canonical suppression in collisions with increasing energy .",
    "the hyperon - to - pion ratio increases when going from pp to , showing a relative enhancement of strangeness production in collisions ( normalized to the pion yield ) which is about half of that seen when normalizing to @xmath6 .",
    "figure [ fig-2 ] shows the recently measured hyperon - to - pion ratios as a function of the charged - particle multiplicity density , compared with results from and collisions .",
    "an enhancement of the multi - strange baryons with multiplicity in data is observed ; it still increases with the strangeness content of the baryon , considering also the @xmath5/@xmath8 ratios published in @xcite .",

    "the corresponding temperatures were obtained from extrapolations of rhic results to lhc energies .",
    "recently , a global fit of all the hadron yields , measured by the alice collaboration , has also been performed @xcite with the thermal grand canonical model ; the chemical equilibrium temperature parameter obtained from the simultaneous fit is lower than the one extrapolated from low energy results and corresponds to about . the solid ( gsi - heidelberg model ) and dashed ( thermus ) green lines in figure 2 show ratios corresponding to chemical equilibrium temperatures of 156 mev and 155 mev , respectively .    the nuclear modification factor ( @xmath4 )",
