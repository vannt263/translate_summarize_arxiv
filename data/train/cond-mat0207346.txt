    "hole - doped lanthanum cobaltates of the type la@xmath3sr@xmath4coo@xmath5 have attracted much attention in recent years due to their unique magnetic and transport properties @xcite .",
    "study of this system is also important for understanding the nature of colossal magnetoresistance in the related oxides , doped manganites @xcite . for technical application ,",
    "the epitaxial films of these compounds are mainly implied to be used . in that case",
    "the shape anisotropy and the film - substrate lattice interaction can induce magnetization anisotropy and , therefore , magnetoresistance ( mr ) anisotropy ( bulk samples of these compounds show no marked magnetic and mr anisotropy ) .",
    "this point was studied rather intensively in manganite films ( see @xcite and references therein ) , but it is hardly to find in literature some studies of this type for doped cobaltates . beside this , the properties of doped cobaltates are influenced by their ( extrinsic and intrinsic ) magnetic inhomogeneity . in this report",
    "we present a study of la@xmath0sr@xmath0coo@xmath1 film which demonstrates a combined influence of the magnetic anisotropy and inhomogeneity on its transport and magnetic properties .",
    "the la@xmath0sr@xmath0coo@xmath1 film ( about 220 nm thick ) was grown by pulsed - laser deposition ( pld ) on a ( 001 ) oriented laalo@xmath2 substrate .",
    "the ceramic target used was prepared by a standard solid - state reaction technique .",
    "a pld system with an nd - yag laser operating at 1.06 @xmath6 m was used to ablate the target .",
    "the pulse energy was about 0.39 j with a repetition rate of 12 hz and pulse duration of 10 ns .",
    "the film was deposited with a substrate temperature of 880@xmath7c in oxygen atmosphere at a pressure of about 8  pa .",
    "the film was cooled down to room temperature after deposition at an oxygen pressure about @xmath8  pa . the target and film",
    "were characterized by x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) study .    the film resistance , as a function of temperature and magnetic field @xmath9 ( up to 20 koe ) ,",
    "was measured using a standard four - point technique .",
    "the field was applied parallel or perpendicular to the film plane . in both cases it was perpendicular to the transport current .",
    "the magnetization , @xmath10 , was measured in a faraday - type magnetometer .",
    "temperature dependences of the film magnetization for the field directions parallel [ @xmath11 and perpendicular [ @xmath12 to the film plane are shown in fig .  1 . the curie temperature , @xmath13 ,",
    "is found to be about 250  k. the @xmath14 behaviour is quite common for ferromagnetic ( fm ) metals . at fairly high field",
    "used , 2  koe , the @xmath14 curve is found to be well above the @xmath15 curve .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that this is determined mainly by the shape anisotropy .",
    "closer inspection shows , however , that @xmath15 behavior can not be attributed solely to the shape - anisotropy effect : @xmath15 and @xmath14 are practically equal in rather broad temperature range below @xmath13 , then ( going to lower temperature ) the @xmath15 curve goes rather abruptly well below the @xmath14 curve and becomes non - monotonic with a pronounced increase in @xmath15 at low temperatures .",
    "these @xmath15 features can be caused by the strain - induced magnetic anisotropy due to the film - substrate interaction .",
    "this guess is supported by the xrd study which has revealed that the film has an out - of - plane tensile strain . for materials with the positive magnetostriction this must favours an out - of - plane easy magnetization .",
    "the temperature dependence of the resistivity , @xmath16 , is non - monotonic ( fig .",
    "2 ) with a maximum at @xmath17  k and a minimum at @xmath18  k. la@xmath0sr@xmath0coo@xmath1 samples with fairly perfect crystalline structure and @xmath19 close to zero are known to be metallic ( @xmath20 ) in the whole range below and above @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 behaviour in fig .  2 reflects inhomogeneous structure of the film and some oxygen deficiency .",
    "due to the last factor , the hole concentration is less then a nominal one ( at @xmath21 ) .",
    "this is responsible for a resistance peak at @xmath22  k which is common for low - doped samples with @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the low temperature resistance minimum is typical for systems of fm regions ( grains or clusters ) with rather weak interconnections .",
    "the inhomogenenous structure can be determined by technological factors of sample preparation ( causing the polycrystalline structure with rather high tunneling bariers between the grains ) or by the phase separation into the hole - rich and hole - poor phase @xcite . for an extended discussion of these points for cobaltate films",
    "see reference @xcite .",
    "the mr is found to be anisotropic .",
    "the absolute values of negative mr in fields parallel to the film plane are considerably above those in perpendicular fields ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "this mr anisotropy takes place only in fm state and disappears for @xmath24 ( fig .",
    "an increase in mr with decreasing temperature ( in the range well below @xmath13 ) is one more indication of poor enough connectivity between the fm grains ( or clusters ) in the film .    the data presented in fig .",
    "3 are pertaining to negative mr for fairly high fields .",
    "in general , the mr curves are hysteretic and have specific features in low - field range ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "actually , their behaviour correlates with that of magnetization curves .",
    "in particular , the field @xmath25 , at which mr has a peak ( fig .  4 ) , corresponds to value of the coercive force ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath27 decreases with increasing temperature and goes to zero with approaching @xmath13 .",
    "the magnitude of positive mr in the low - field range , @xmath28/r(0)$ ] , is some measure of the remanent magnetization .",
    "we found that @xmath27 and @xmath29 depend on the field direction and reflect in this way the magnetization anisotropy .",
    "in particular , at @xmath30  k the value of @xmath27 in the out - of - plane field is less than that in the in - plane field , and @xmath29 value is higher for the out - of - plane field direction .",
    "the opposite relations ( that is , lesser @xmath27 values and higher @xmath29 values for the in - plane field ) are found for higher temperatures @xmath31  k. this implies that at low temperatures the out - of - plane magnetization is favoured , whereas at higher temperatures the in - plane magnetization becomes dominant . the pronounced increase in @xmath15 at low temperatures ( fig .",
    "1 ) supports additionally this suggestion .",
    "all these are doubtless indications of the temperature - driven spin reorientation transition which is a result of competition between the shape anisotropy and the strain - induced anisotropy .",
    "this transition has been studied intensively for films of common fm metals ( see , e.  g. @xcite ) , but was never mentioned for manganite or cobaltate films ."
