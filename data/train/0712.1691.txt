    "the field of hadron spectroscopy has been revitalized by the discovery of a number of new particles at @xmath0-factories .",
    "the first of the series is a @xmath1 state , the @xmath2 , decaying to @xmath3 , found by belle and later confirmed by cdf , d0 and babar  @xcite .",
    "the difficulty at interpreting this particle as a standard charmonium has opened the way to alternative interpretations .",
    "the diquark - antidiquark , @xmath4[\\bar c \\bar q]$ ] picture  @xcite , at the moment , seems the most promising .",
    "there are at least two reasons for this :    * the @xmath2 decays with the same rate in @xmath5 and @xmath6 , therefore maximally violating isospin . in the diquark picture ,",
    "two states are needed to explain this decay pattern , namely an @xmath7 and an @xmath8 , with a difference in mass of the order of @xmath9 .",
    "recently belle and babar have shown the existence of a second @xmath10 at a mass of @xmath11  mev , confirming the diquark model prediction  @xcite . *",
    "the stringiest prediction of the diquark model was the existence of charged particles decaying to @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "last summer a state of this kind has been discovered by belle : the @xmath13 decaying to @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "after the discovery of the @xmath2 , babar has found a new state produced in isr , the @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "again a charmonium interpretation was not tenable for this particle , despite its decay to @xmath3 .",
    "the diquark model explains the @xmath15 as a @xmath16 state made up of two diquarks in p - wave which decays to @xmath17 , a strong candidate for a light four - quark state , and @xmath18 .",
    "the increasing number of @xmath19 states being found , casts serious doubts on the fact that all of them can be explained , separately , as effects ( threshold effects , cusp effects ... ) or loosely bound molecules  @xcite of open charm mesons . if other ways of aggregation of quarks in matter are indeed possible , a unified explanation of all these particles , and of the coming ones ( hopefully ! ) , will emerge clearly from data .",
    "the strongest theoretical motivation for the diquark - antidiquark picture lies in its consistent description of the scalar mesons below @xmath21  gev , namely @xmath22 .",
    "these are likely bound states of a spin zero diquark @xmath23 where latin indices label flavor and greek letters are for color , and an anti - diquark @xmath24 .",
    "the color is saturated as in a standard @xmath25 meson : @xmath26 . therefore , since a spin zero diquark is in a @xmath27-flavor representation , nonets of @xmath28 states are allowed ( crypto - exotic states ) .",
    "the sub - gev scalar mesons represent most likely in the lowest tetraquark nonet .",
    "the @xmath28 model of light - scalars is very effective at explaining the most striking feature of these particles : the inverted pattern in the mass - versus-@xmath29 diagram  @xcite , with respect to what observed for ordinary @xmath25 mesons.this aspect is not explicable using a @xmath25 model .",
    "for example , in the @xmath25 model , the @xmath17 should be an @xmath30 state  @xcite while the @xmath31 , @xmath32 , should be a @xmath33 state .",
    "if this were the case , the degeneracy of the two particles would appear quite mysterious .    beyond a correct description of the mass-@xmath29 pattern , the tetraquark model offers the possibility to explain the decay rates of scalars at a level never reached in standard @xmath25 descriptions .",
    "the decay lagrangian into two pseudoscalar mesons , e.g. @xmath34 , is : @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the flavor labels of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , while @xmath39 are the flavor labels of the quarks @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 is the effective coupling weighting this interaction term and @xmath43 are the scalar and pseudoscalar matrices .",
    "this lagrangian describes the quark exchange amplitude for the quarks to tunnel out of their diquark shells to form ordinary mesons  @xcite .",
    "such mechanism is the alternative to the color string breaking @xmath44 , _ i.e. _ , a baryon - anti - baryon decay , phase - space forbidden to sub - gev scalar mesons .",
    "the problem with  ( [ exchange ] ) is that it is not able to describe the decay @xmath45 because @xmath46 , being @xmath47 the @xmath48 flavors so that , see equation  ( [ defdq ] ) , @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath50 $ ] . an annihilation diagram is needed to replace the @xmath51 quarks .",
    "this clearly induces a small rate which does not match the observed one .",
    "we have faced this problem recently and we are confident to have found a solid solution which generally improves the agreement with data of all light scalar mesons decay rates  @xcite .",
    "the successful theoretical interpretation of the light scalar mesons in terms of diquarks suggest that such structures could exist also at higher mass scales .",
    "an heavy - light diquark is still bound in color @xmath52 , but : * 1 .",
    "* we can not state anymore that there is a fermi statistics that forces the diquarks to be in @xmath53 or @xmath54 depending",
    "if the diquark spin is zero or one ( a charm quark by no way can be considered identical to a light @xmath55 with respect to strong interactions ) ; * 2 . *",
    "the spin - spin interaction is weakened by @xmath56 . according to lattice studies ,",
    "light diquarks are preferably formed with spin@xmath57 . on the other hand",
    ", heavy - light diquarks could appear equally well in spin @xmath58 and @xmath21 .",
    "therefore our _ ansatz _ for heavy - light diquarks is : @xmath59 the flavor @xmath60 is carried by the light quark , while @xmath61 for all @xmath19 . such spin 1 diquarks are likely the building blocks of the new particles , and since the flavor of @xmath62 is the flavor of the light quark , we can still accommodate particles like the @xmath2 and its partners in @xmath63 nonets  @xcite . in our notation : @xmath64    we have shown in  @xcite that , assuming : @xmath65 we obtain a simple rule for the ratios of branching ratios of @xmath0 decays . with an obvious notation : @xmath66 this is to be confronted with the most recent experimental data , giving : @xmath67    such quite reasonable agreement gives credit to our assignations for @xmath2 and @xmath68 .",
    "clearly enough , the situation of the remaining @xmath1 _ charged _ partners has to be clarifed .",
    "we have reasons to believe that they can be very broad and this could cast some doubts on their actual visibility .",
    ".some @xmath69 neutral tetraquark wave functions constructible from diquarks .",
    "consider that @xmath70 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ wavefunct ]",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the @xmath71 , most likely a @xmath72 state , is the first charged particle observed that plausibly fits very well a diquark - antidiquark interpretation . due to its decay to @xmath73",
    "we think that @xmath71 is itself a radial excitation of one of the lowest lying @xmath72 states predicted by the tetraquark model to be at a mass of @xmath74  mev  @xcite .",
    "in particular it is striking to observe that : @xmath75 so the search of @xmath76 states , neutral and charged , is particularly urgent .    scanning higher energy regions one approaches baryon - baryon thresholds , like @xmath77  mev and @xmath78  mev .",
    "as mentioned above , the baryon - antibaryon decay channel is expected to be quite natural for a diquark - antidiquark system .",
    "this would mean that , above a certain threshold , all charmed tetraquark states are expected to be very broad .",
    "in the large number of colors @xmath79 expansion , four - quark states of the kind @xmath80 are suppressed , in the sense that they do not appear as leading terms in the @xmath79 expansion of the two - point correlation function @xmath81 .",
    "indeed , the leading term of such a correlator would represent a disconnected graph ( see the left diagram in fig .  1 ) .",
    "the disconnected diagram is @xmath82 larger than the connected one ( bounded meson ) in the  t hooft expansion  @xcite.,width=302 ]    but if we replace quarks with diquarks : @xmath83 , there are no disconnected parts and the leading color diagram looks like the one depicted in fig .  2 .",
    ", width=113 ]    in other words , if the diquarks are assumed to be the building blocks , we evade the @xmath79 difficulty with standard ( ) tetraquarks .",
    "this reminds of the corrigan - ramond ( cr )  @xcite large @xmath84 limit where quarks and ` larks ' are introduced , transforming as the @xmath85 and @xmath86 representations of @xmath87 .",
    "larks , @xmath88 , are therefore antisymmetric objects , @xmath89 , coinciding with antiquarks if @xmath90 .",
    "a theory of only larks is equivalent to qcd . in the cr expansion",
    ", it is therefore possible to consider baryons at large @xmath84 , if the baryon is represented by a color saturated @xmath91 state ( for three quarks one can neutralize the color with an @xmath92 if the colors are three : there are no color singlets made up of three quarks for @xmath93 ) . since larks have two color indices ( like gluons in the  t hooft limit  @xcite , but with the arrow pointing in the same directions - gluon lines @xmath94 have opposite arrows - ) , the large @xmath84 power counting works differently ( see fig .",
    "a diquark - antidiquark state is then like a lark - antilark state @xmath95 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) .     two point correlation function on the left and the correlator on the right ( where a four - lark structure emerge in the intermediate state ) , are of the same @xmath79 order . in the ",
    "t hooft limit , and with only quarks , the left diagram dominates , being larger by @xmath96 . , width=226 ]",
    "the interest for such problems has implications beyond spectroscopy itself .",
    "this is not merely a chemistry exercise , aimed at a classification of new ` elements ' whose nature has very little impact to qcd fundamental issues .",
    "qcd is extremely predictive only in a narrow range of very high energy phenomena , while the study of hadron structures and interactions remains a very difficult field which is mainly approached with the use of effective theories and lattice studies .",
    "being able to assess that new forms of aggregation of quarks are possible , such as diquarks , opens a window on a territory poorly known .",
    "moreover , diquarks are essential to the theory of color superconductivity  @xcite , which is at the basis of the comprehension of an entirely new sector of the qcd phase diagram .    the skepticism of the community about the tetraquarks is mainly driven by the shock following the ` discovery ' and the disappearance of the baryonic pentaquarks .",
    "it is quite possible that multiquark baryons might exist at higher masses .",
    "anyway , there is no clear logical connection between the four - quark mesons we are discussing here and the pentaquark baryons ; one should also remind that the case for four - quark mesons is based on the phenomenology of light scalars since a very long time .",
    "some other recent investigations on diquark based tetraquark charmed mesons can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we believe that a strong experimental effort aimed at searching the new predicted particles and clearly discriminate between models is of great importance for a progress in the comprehension of key aspects of non - perturbative qcd .",
