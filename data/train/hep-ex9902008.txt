    "in recent years the `` shashlik '' technology has been extensively studied to assess its performance at @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 accelerator experiments @xcite .",
    "shashlik calorimeters are sampling calorimeters in which scintillation light is read - out via wavelength shifting ( wls ) fibers running perpendicularly to the converter / absorber plates @xcite .",
    "this technique offers the combination of an easy assembly , good hermeticity and fast time response . in many applications it also represents a cheap solution compared to crystals or cryogenic liquid calorimeters .",
    "shashlik calorimeters are , in particular , considered to be good candidates for barrel electromagnetic calorimetry at future linear @xmath1 colliders @xcite . in this context , the physics requirements impose @xmath4 , at least three longitudinal samplings , transversal segmentation of the order of @xmath5 ( @xmath6  @xmath7 ) and the possibility of performing the read - out in a 3  t magnetic field . the present shashlik technology can satisfy these requirements , except for the optimization of longitudinal segmentation which still needs development . the solution proposed in this paper",
    "consists of thin vacuum photodiodes inserted between adjacent towers in the front part of the calorimeter .",
    "they measure the energy deposited in the initial shower development that allows for longitudinal sampling and @xmath0 separation .",
    "a prototype detector was exposed to a beam with the aim of measuring the sampling capability and demonstrating that the insertion of diodes neither deteriorates critically the energy response nor produces significant cracks in the tower structure .",
    "the tested prototype had 25 pb / scintillator towers , assembled in a @xmath8 matrix .",
    "each tower consisted of 140 layers of 1  mm thick lead and 1  mm thick scintillator tiles , resulting in a total depth of @xmath9 .",
    "the sampling was the finest ever used with the shashlik technique .",
    "the transversal dimension of each tower was @xmath10  @xmath7 .",
    "in the first @xmath11 the tiles had a smaller transverse dimension to provide room for the housing of the diodes . plastic scintillator consisting of polystyrene",
    "doped with 1.5% paraterphenyl and 0.05% popop was used .",
    "optical insulation between the towers was provided by white tyvek paper .",
    "as it is custumary in shashlik technique , the blue light produced in the scintillator was carried to the photodetector at the back of the calorimeter by means of plastic optical fibers doped with green wls .",
    "the 1 mm diameter fibers crossed the tiles in holes drilled in the lead and scintillator plates and they were uniformly distributed with a density of 1 fiber/@xmath7 . in the scintillator tiles the holes were 2 mm larger ( 4 mm in the lead ) than the fiber diameter .",
    "the light transmission between the plastic scintillator and the fibers was in air .",
    "all the fibers from the same tower were bundled together at the back and connected to photodetectors .",
    "two types of fibers were tested : bicron bcf20 fibers and kuraray y11 . in both cases ,",
    "the emission peak was at about 500 nm .",
    "light collection was increased by aluminizing the fiber end opposite to the photodetector by sputtering .",
    "the light from the fibers was viewed after a 5  mm air gap by 1 ",
    "hamamatsu r2149 - 03 phototetrodes .",
    "each tetrode was placed inside an aluminium housing , containing a charge sensitive jfet preamplifier and a high voltage divider .",
    "the differential output signals were shaped with a shaping time of 1.500 @xmath12s and digitized .",
    "four towers were read - out with hamamatsu avalanche photodiodes instead of tetrodes .",
    "a plexiglass light guide was used to match the smaller apd sensitive area to the fiber bundle .",
    "preamplifiers and voltage dividers were housed in the same mechanical structure as the tetrodes .",
    "two types of vacuum photodiodes , viewed with a bialcali photocathode , were produced by emi ( hamamatsu ) with a rectangular ( squared ) front surface of @xmath13 @xmath7 ( @xmath10 @xmath7 ) and a thickness of 5 mm .",
    "the diodes were installed in the first part of the towers in order to sample the energy deposited in the first 8  @xmath14 .",
    "they were in optical contact with the lateral side of the scintillator tiles and the light emitted in first part of the detector was therefore read - out twice since the photons crossing the lateral scintillator surface were collected by the diode while those reaching the fibers , either directly or after reflections , were seen by the tetrodes . due to the direct coupling ,",
    "the light collection efficiency of the diodes was much larger than that of the tetrodes / apd s and this compensated for the absence of gain in the diodes .",
    "most of the cells were equipped with emi vacuum photodiodes .",
    "one diode prototype from hamamatsu , sampling only 4  @xmath14 , was successfully tested during the last part of the data taking .",
    "technical characteristics of these devices are listed in table  [ diodechar ] .",
    "the hamamatsu prototype dimensions are such that it is possible to house two diodes in the same tower in order to obtain three longitudinal samplings .",
    "for all diodes , the same front - end electronics and read - out chain as for the tetrodes were used .",
    "the read - out electronics was positioned above the tower stacks ( cfr.fig.[install ] ) .    .",
    "technical characteristics of vacuum photodiodes . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     fig.[ediode ] shows @xmath15 versus @xmath16 for pions and electrons at 20  gev .",
    "the discriminating power of the different variables in terms of pion contamination for 90% electron efficiency , at energies ranging from 20 to 50  gev is shown in fig.[episep ] . in most of the cases ,",
    "purely calorimetric variables improve the overall separation capability with a factor @xmath17 compared with @xmath18 by itself . at 50  gev",
    "the pion contamination for 90% electron efficiency is @xmath19 .",
    "the present test has demonstrated the technical feasibility of longitudinally segmented shashlik calorimeters in which lateral sampling is performed by vacuum photodiodes . due to the small dimension of the diodes and to the tilt of fibers and diodes with respect to the incoming particles ,",
    "no significant cracks or dead zones are introduced .",
    "performance in terms of energy resolution , impact point reconstruction and @xmath0 separation seem to be adequate for applications at future @xmath1 collider experiments .",
    "the ihep workshop staff has been essential for the construction of the prototype : we are greatly indebted with a. kleschov , p. korobchuk and a. tukhtarov .",
    "we wish to thank also c. fanin for the mechanical project , v. giordano and r. cereseto for the careful work in the realization of the prototype , g. rampazzo for the invaluable effort in the construction of the read - out chain and all the staff and technical support of the sl - ea group for the smooth operation of the accelerator during the testbeam .",
    "a special thank to c. luci for providing the simulation code at the early stage of this work and to m. pegoraro and g. zumerle for usefull suggestions and for granting the use of emi diodes .",
