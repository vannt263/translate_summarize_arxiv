    "the system has been extensively studied at both optical and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "while it is considered to be a neutron star binary system there has been no confirmed detection of pulsation .",
    "@xcite reported a possible 13.8 day periodicity in the x - ray emission from u1700 .",
    "their results are based on the long term observations by the all - sky monitor ( asm , 2  10 kev ) @xcite on the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) and the burst and transient source experiment ( batse , 20  200 kev ) @xcite on the compton gamma ray observatory ( _ cgro _ ) .",
    "more data has been collected since their report .",
    "here we present the results of long - term period searches using all the data available as of this writing .",
    "we employed all - sky monitor x - ray light curves from batseon _ cgro_satellite and asmon the _",
    "all data presented here are publicly available by an on - line service from the laboratory for high energy astrophysics ( lhea ) at nasa / gsfc .",
    "using earth occultations batseprovides long term flux histories for bright x - ray sources in the energy range from 20 to 300 kev . in this paper , we used 3321 days ( from jd 2448370 ) of daily - averaged , long - term flux from u1700 given by the batseoccultation technique ( figure  [ fig : lc ] ) .",

    "no additional cut was applied to the data for analysis .    for the period search",
    ", @xcite used the epoch - folding technique , which is based on @xcite .",
    "the epoch - folding technique in @xcite does not take into account phase selection effects .",
    "here we used the phase - averaged epoch - folding technique @xcite .",
    "the phase - averaged epoch - folding technique is less vulnerable to false alarms due to random fluctuations than a single - phase epoch - folding technique . in practice",
    ", the outcome of the phase - averaged epoch - folding technique is similar to that of the epoch - folding technique with an optimally chosen bin size @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\">,^,^ , > \" , ]      + the uneclipsed data ( the orbital phase : 0.2  0.8 ) + exhibits multiple peaks around 13.8 days . here",
    "we consider them as a part of a single broad peak to estimate the overall peak location and the width .",
    "@xcite argued that the origin of the 13.8 day periodicity is a free precession of the neutron star arising from misalignment of the orbital axis and the neutron star spin axis .",
    "the analysis of the _ cgro_batseand _",
    "rxte_asmdata indicates that the 13.8 day periodicity weakened dramatically after @xmath0 jd 2450000 .",
    "if the precession of the neutron star caused the 13.8 day periodicity , the weakening of the periodicity implies that the neutron star precession has been dissipating",
    ". such an interpretation may not be the most favorable one because it suggests that u1700 was experiencing a sudden , unusual change of the system geometry .    in this section ,",
    "we investigate accretion disk precession models in order to explain the 13.8 day periodicity and the instability of x - ray emission from u1700 , without invoking a dramatic change of the system geometry .",
    "so far about 15 x - ray binary systems are known to show a long term period , often called a superorbital period , in their light curve , and in many cases , the superorbital period is successfully explained by a precession of the accretion disk with respect to the orbital plane @xcite . although u1700 is a primarily stellar wind driven system , there are several observational results supporting a possible transient accretion disk in the system .",
    "therefore we first explore the clues and the characteristics of an accretion disk in the system .",
    "second , we apply two different accretion - disk precession models  radiation driven ( ogilvie & dubus 2001 - hereafter od ) , and magnetically driven @xcite warped disk precession models and we study the implications .",
    "disk accretion is one of the most radiation - efficient accretion processes .",
    "when a stellar wind driven system like u1700 forms an accretion disk , the disk accretion usually enhances the overall accretion rate , leading to higher x - ray emission in general .",
    "so a sudden increase of x - ray flux from some systems indicates the formation of an accretion disk in the system .",
    "for example , gx 3012 is a wind - driven high - mass x - ray binary ( hmxrb ) with a partially underfilled roche lobe , similar to u1700 .",
    "the observed spin - up episodes in gx 3012 are successfully explained by the formation of a transient disk and its angular momentum exchange with the neutron star @xcite .",
    "since the spin - up episodes in gx 3012 are accompanied by enhancement in the x - ray flux from the system , an increase in x - ray emission can be used as indirect evidence of an accretion disk in the system .    in the case of u1700",
    ", the intensity distribution of the first 1780 days of the batsedata shows a clear difference from that of the next 1541 days of the data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : intensity_distribution ] ) . in the first 1780 days of the data , which exhibit the 13.8 day periodicity rather strongly , there are relatively more occurrences of high flux events than in the next 1541 days of the data .",
    "the difference in the average flux of these two data sets is 0.0083 in the given unit . randomly dividing the combined data into two sets of data - 1780 and 1541 day long each",
    ", we found that the probability of getting such a difference from random fluctuations in a single distribution is negligible ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the increase in the x - ray flux may be caused by changes in the stellar wind of the companion .",
    "however , the correlation between the frequency of high x - ray flux episodes and the strength of the 13.8 day periodicity indicates that both may be related to disk accretion .",
    "if the difference in the average flux is caused by changes in disk accretion , the estimated fraction of the x - ray flux from disk accretion is @xmath2 14% .",
    "this is a very crude estimation due to the limited data statistics .",
    "other compelling evidence of disk accretion is quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) of x - ray flux .",
    "it is often believed that qpos are caused by the material orbiting near the inner edge of the accretion disk . in u1700 ,",
    "qpos were observed on several occasions during the uneclipsed phase and they lasted @xmath0 200  1200 seconds ( @xcite and references therein ) . in order to explain these qpo episodes , @xcite proposed a beat frequency model ( bfm ) mechanism operating in a transient accretion disk near the x - ray source . in the bfm ,",
    "a series of clumps in the accretion disk orbit the neutron star at the magnetopause in keplerian motion , and the qpos are a modulation at the beat frequency between the keplerian rotation frequency at the magnetosphere and the neutron star spin frequency .",
    "the episodic detection of qpos may imply a transient accretion disk @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated @xmath3 ( roche - lobe filling factor ) , which also supports the idea of accretion through a transient disk .",
    "taking the idea of a transient disk a step further , we suggest that a transient disk in u1700 can be quite persistent ( @xmath4 1000 days ) .",
    "first , it should be noted that the episodic behaviour could be simply due to the occasional formation of certain clumps in a persistent or transient disk .",
    "second , if the companion o star is a just - underfilled - roche lobe system ( @xmath5 ) , the star may frequently undergo at least partial roche - lobe overfilling due to various instabilities . for instance ,",
    "tidal force driven disruption of the atmosphere of the companion star can cause instability .",
    "naturally the time scale for such overfilling would be related to the orbital period  3.4 days .",
    "therefore , such instabilities provide a semi - periodic source to feed a transient or permanent accretion disk .",
    "the continual roche - lobe overfilling may result in accretion through several successive rings rather than a continuous disk .",
    "however , as often assumed for many disk models , it is believed that the inward drift rate of such a ring is much slower than the rate of viscous - driven ring broadening .",
    "the material is likely to be accreted by one continuous disk rather than multiple rings .",
    "in fact , if the 13.8 day period is due to disk accretion , one can loosely estimate the lifetime of the accretion disk from the epoch - folding search results . in the epoch - folding searches of the first 1780 days of the batsedata",
    ", the width of the @xmath6 peak around 13.8 days indicates that the peak originates in a single periodicity .",
    "however , in the case that a series of short - term transient disks formed and disappeared successively in the given epoch , the long term periodicity is likely made of multiple periods .",
    "this results because the long term periodicity caused by the precession of each disk could be slightly different from one another , although it could be roughly the same as long as each disk forms and operates in similar conditions .",
    "furthermore , it is not guaranteed that the periodicity in x - rays from each disk would be in phase unless the disk formation procedure is periodic .",
    "the different periodicities and their distinct phases induced by each disk can contribute to wash out the modulation of the folded light curve in epoch folding searches , and these may have caused the observed weakening and spreading of the long term periodicity in the later part of the data .",
    "consequently , a single , relatively strong 13.8 day periodicity in the early batsedata is likely due to one or only a few accretion disks , and the duration of the strong 13.8 day periodicity is of order the lifetime of an accretion disk in the system .",
    "it is not easy to estimate the exact duration of the 13.8 day periodicity in the data .",
    "however , judging from the significance of the @xmath6 over @xmath0 300 days or 1700 days of data , we estimate that the lifetime of the transient disk could be larger than a few 100 days",
    ".    one can also estimate the disk lifetime in relation to the time scale @xmath7 of viscous damping of the disk .",
    "@xmath8 where @xmath9 is the viscosity parameter , @xmath10 the neutron star mass in , @xmath11 the accretion rate in @xmath12 g / sec , and @xmath13 the radial distance from the neutron star in @xmath14 cm @xcite .",
    "the accretion rate can be calculated from the observed flux @xmath15 erg / sec , and @xmath16 is mostly due to stellar wind capture . assuming that the radiation efficiency @xmath17 is @xmath0 0.1 and that @xmath0 14% of @xmath16 is from disk accretion , we get @xmath18 .",
    "the range of @xmath19 for the disk can be estimated , too .",
    "the disc is cut off at the tidal radius @xmath19 where the tidal torque first changes sign , and thus the outer radius of the disk @xmath20 = @xmath19 . according to @xcite , @xmath19 @xmath21 0.87 @xmath22 , where @xmath22 is the volume - averaged roche radius of the accretor",
    ". @xcite calculated @xmath22 in terms of the binary separation @xmath23 and the mass ratio @xmath24 (= @xmath10/@xmath25 = @xmath26 , where @xmath25 is the mass of the companion star ) . assuming @xmath27 and @xmath28 for u1700 @xcite",
    ", we get @xmath29 cm . finally , according to @xcite ,",
    "@xmath10 @xmath21 2.6 .",
    "now we can estimate the disk lifetime from @xmath7 at @xmath19 = @xmath20 . in u1700 , at @xmath19 = @xmath20 , we gets @xmath7 @xmath0 1900  4600 days for a typical @xmath9 in the range of 0.1  0.3 . as mentioned earlier , the inward drift in the disk is mainly driven by the viscosity , and therefore , such a long viscous time scale implies that the disk can have a long lifetime ( @xmath4 1000 days ) .    in summary",
    ", u1700 can have a transient disk that can last @xmath4 1000 days due to frequent roche - lobe overfilling ( @xmath0 3.4 days ) .",
    "if the precession of such an accreton disk induces the 13.8 day period in x - ray emission , the change of the periodicity is likely related to the stability of the precession .",
    "in addition , in this picture of a frequent roche - lobe overfilled accretion disk model , instability of the accretion disk itself can contribute to the weakening of the 13.8 day periodicity in x - ray emission .",
    "for instance , the system may have transitioned into a less frequent roche - lobe overfilling state that allows the formation of very short - term transient disks only .",
    "this is consistent with the observed weakening and spreading of the long term periodicity in the later part of the data .      in the radiation - driven , warped - disk precession model ,",
    "the radiation from the central source provides a torque to warp the disk and subsequently allows the precession of the disk . the instability criterion for the radiation - driven disk",
    "warping is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the ratio of the two effective viscosities associated with the shear parallel ( @xmath32 ) and vertical ( @xmath33 ) to the disk plane ( od ) . under the assumptions of the model by od ,",
    "@xmath34 can be expressed as a function of the viscosity parameter @xmath9 . in @xcite , the ratio , @xmath35 ,",
    "can be given by a function of the mass ratio @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , once @xmath9 and @xmath17 are known , one can determine the instability of disk warping from @xmath23 for a given @xmath36 .",
    "figure  [ fig : stability ] , taken from od , shows the instability condition in @xmath23 versus @xmath36 ( @xmath23 is now in @xmath37 ) .    in the figure , od pointed out that systems near the instability limit tend to show a steady precession ( _ e.g. _ her x-1 , ss 433 , and lmc x-4 ) . the systems that lie away from the instability limit exhibit somewhat unstable precession ( _ e.g. _ cen x-3 , smc x-1 , 4u1907 + 09 ) .",
    "in the case of hmxrbs ( @xmath36 @xmath0 10 ) , the instability condition becomes @xmath38 for @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( od ) . in the case of u1700 , assuming @xmath41 31 @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xcite , @xmath44 is @xmath0 5.4 . or if @xmath45 36 @xmath42 and @xmath46 1.8 @xmath47 @xcite , @xmath44 is @xmath0 9.4 .",
    "while u1700 does satisfy the instability condition of disk warping , it lies somewhat away from the instability limit .",
    "therefore , according to od , u1700 belongs to the group of unstably precessing hmxrbs such as cen x-3 , smc x-1 , and 4u 1907 + 09 .",
    "therefore , if the 13.8 day period of x - ray flux from u1700 is due to a radiation driven disk precession , the instability of the periodicity is not surprising .",
    "it should be noted that in the above comparison with the model , many parameters assumed for u1700 are not well constrained .",
    "in particular , @xmath9 , a critical parameter of the model , is unknown for the disk of u1700 .",
    "thus , as in od , we assumed @xmath9 = 0.3 , which is a typical value for a nominal disk and this assumption allows a direct comparison with the model described in od .",
    "the precession period estimate given by od also indirectly supports the idea of the unstably precessing disk in u1700 .",
    "the estimate in od is given only for steadily precessing systems and the estimated period @xmath48 depends mostly on @xmath10 and @xmath49 . for @xmath50 ,",
    "the range of precession frequency @xmath51 is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a constant relating the second vertical moment of the density and the surface density of the disk ( @xmath53 = 4.4 in cgs units ; refer to eq .  9 in od ) .",
    "the predicted precession period given for her x-1 in od allows one to estimate the precession period for other steadily precessing system .",
    "@xmath54    if u1700 is a steadily precessing system , the estimated range of the long term period is @xmath0 290  620 days for @xmath55 2.6 @xmath47 and @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , the observed 13.8 day period is too short for u1700 to be a steadily precessing system according to the model .",
    "however , od also stated that the prediction is subject to large errors due to large uncertainties in the model parameters and for u1700 , @xmath11 is somewhat poorly constrained here .",
    "@xcite introduced a magnetically driven warping / precession model for superorbital periods in x - ray binaries . in this model , strong magnetic fields in the magnetosphere , in particular ones penetrating the accretion disk , exert a torque necessary for disk warping and precession . in magnetically driven disk warping an inner portion of the disk will be warped and as a result the disk will precess .    in the case of u1700 , persistent pulsation has not been observed .",
    "therefore , the existence of a strong magnetic field in the system is not confirmed .",
    "however , the hard x - ray spectrum implies that the system may have strong magnetic fields . for example , a hard tail in the hard x - ray spectrum is the characteristic of a massive binary system with an x - ray pulsar @xcite , and the _ bepposax _ observation showed some hints of a broad cyclotron absorption feature @xcite .",
    "the instability condition of magnetically driven warping is that the magnetic warping gross rate @xmath57 should be larger than the viscous damping rate @xcite , or @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the radius of the magnetosphere boundary , and @xmath61 where @xmath34 is a constant of order unity and @xmath62 the magnetic dipole moment of the neutron star in @xmath63 g @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "for example , in the case of u1700 , @xmath7 @xmath0 6 day at @xmath65 @xmath0 0.01 @xmath20 . since @xmath66 and @xmath67 , if @xmath68 6 day at @xmath65 = 0.01 @xmath20 , @xmath69 at @xmath70  @xmath20 .",
    "then , the magnetic fields can warp the disk at @xmath71  @xmath20 . for u1700 , assuming @xmath72 = 1.86 (= @xmath10/1.4@xmath47 ) , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , we get @xmath75 ( 1.01@xmath76@xmath77  cm ) @xmath78",
    ". therefore , in order to have magnetically driven warping at @xmath79  @xmath20 , @xmath80 from @xmath81  @xmath20 .",
    "@xcite provides @xmath57 and the magnetically driven precession frequency @xmath82 in terms of various parameters such as the magnetic dipole moment . because of the lack of the confirmed persistent pulsation from u1700 , it is difficult to estimate basic information related to the magnetic field of the system such as the magnetic dipole moment",
    "thus , it is even more difficult to estimate @xmath57 and @xmath82 .",
    "however , we can get a magnetic - field independent relation from the ratio of @xmath82 and @xmath57 ( eq 6.3 and 6.13 in @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath83 where @xmath84 the angle between the neutron star spin axis and the disk rotation axis , and @xmath85 the angle between the neutron star spin axis and its magnetic moment , @xmath86 max(@xmath87 ) ( @xmath88 is the half - thickness of the disk and @xmath89 specifies the azimuthal pitch of the field line ( in general @xmath90 ) .    for a precession of the whole disk , a modal analysis",
    "is required for a proper evaluation of @xmath91 . in general , @xmath84 will alternate between its maximum and minumum along the azimuthal direction .",
    "thus , azimuthally averaged @xmath92 . assuming @xmath93 , @xmath94 @xcite , @xmath95 and @xmath96 days , the above relation becomes @xmath97 for @xmath39 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , @xmath100 at @xmath101 , where @xmath65 and @xmath60 are in @xmath14 cm .",
    "therefore , if a magnetically field driven disk precession caused the 13.8 day period in the x - ray emission from u1700 , @xmath102 this result implies that the weaker the field is , the more likely aligned the neutron star spin axis and the magnetic dipole axis are .",
    "for example , if u1700 develops magnetically driven disk warping at @xmath103 0.01 @xmath20 ( @xmath104 day ) , the above relation reduces to @xmath105 and @xmath106 . or in the case that relatively weak magnetic fields are present , the warping would occur in a smaller portion of the disk .",
    "so , if the warping occurs at @xmath107 0.002 @xmath108 , @xmath109 day , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",
    "if there is indeed such an alignment , it explains the lack of the observed persisent pulsation from u1700 .    in disk precession models ,",
    "the central source will be succesively seen in ` on ' and ` off ' states due to the varying obscuration by the disk . as a result",
    ", a large modulation is expected in the detected light curve , as seen in the well - established disk - precession sources like her x-1 , lmc x-4 , and smc x-1 . however , u1700 exhibits a somewhat small modulation in the folded light curve at the observed long term period ( figure  [ fig : phase ] ) .",
    "the small modulation can be explained consistently in the disk precession models .",
    "first , there can be some extended emission regions such as disk corona sources @xcite .",
    "second , in u1700 , it is possible that due to the inherent instability of disk precession ( or the disk itself ) , for a certain fraction of precession cycles the central source is not completely hidden by the disk even at the maximum obscuration .",
    "an alternative explanation is the variable - accretion rate model , which is favored for the observed long term period in lmc x-3 @xcite .",
    "further studies such as the spectral variation analysis are required to assess whether such a model is compatible with u1700 .",
    "we studied the long term ",
    "13.8 day periodicity in x - ray flux from u1700 .",
    "the epoch folding analysis indicates that the periodicity was relatively strong and consisted of a single period in the early data of the batseobservation .",
    "the long periodicity feature weakened and spread over multiple periods after @xmath0 jd 2450000 when _ rxte_started its observation .",
    "we investigated the origin of the 13.8 day period in x - rays using disk precession models .",
