    "large scale structures like galaxies and clusters of galaxies are believed to have formed by gravitational amplification of small perturbations @xcite .",
    "observations suggest that the initial density perturbations were present at all scales that have been probed by observations .",
    "an essential part of the study of formation of galaxies and other large scale structures is thus the evolution of density perturbations for such initial conditions .",
    "once the amplitude of perturbations at any scale becomes large , i.e. , @xmath0 , the perturbation becomes non - linear and the coupling with perturbations at other scales can not be ignored . indeed , understanding the interplay of density perturbations at different scales is essential for developing a full understanding of gravitational collapse in an expanding universe .",
    "the basic equations for this have been known for a long time @xcite but apart from some special cases , few solutions are known .",
    "a statistical approach to this problem based on pair conservation equation has yielded interesting results @xcite , and these results have motivated detailed studies to obtain fitting functions to express the non - linear correlation function or power spectrum in terms of the linearly evolved correlation function @xcite .",
    "it is well known from simulation studies that at the level of second moment , i.e. , power spectrum , correlation function , etc . , large scales have an important effect on small scales but small scales do not have a significant effect on large scales @xcite .",
    "most of these studies used power spectrum as the measure of clustering .",
    "results of these simulation studies form the basis for the use of n - body simulations , e.g. , from the above results we can safely assume that small scales not resolved in simulations do not effect power spectrum at large scales and can be ignored .",
    "substructure can play an important role in the relaxation process .",
    "it can induce mixing in phase space @xcite , or change halo profiles by introducing transverse motions @xcite , and , gravitational interactions between small clumps can bring in an effective collisionality even for a collisionless fluid @xcite .",
    "thus it is important to understand the role played by substructure in gravitational collapse and relaxation in the context of an expanding background . in particular",
    ", we would like to know if this leaves an imprint on the non - linear evolution of correlation function .",
    "effect of substructure on collapse and relaxation of larger scales is another manifestation of mode coupling .    in this paper",
    ", we report results from a study of mode coupling in gravitational collapse .",
    "in particular , we study how presence of density perturbations at small scales influences collapse and relaxation of perturbations at larger scales .",
    "these effects have been studied in past @xcite but the motivation was slightly different @xcite .",
    "we believe it is important to study the issue in greater detail and make the relevance of these effects more quantitative using n - body simulations with a larger number of particles .",
    "we also study the reverse process , i.e. , how does collapse of perturbations at large scales effect density perturbations at much smaller scales .",
    "it is well known that the local geometry of collapse at the time of initial shell crossing is planar in nature @xcite , hence we model density perturbations as a single plane wave in this work",
    ". simple nature of the large scale fluctuation allows us to study interaction of well separated scales without resorting to statistical estimators like power spectrum .",
    "we are studying the same problem in a more general setting and those results will be reported in a later publication .",
    "key features of collapse of a plane wave can be understood using quasi - linear approximations , at least at a qualitative level .",
    "initial collapsing phase is well modelled by the zeldovich approximation @xcite , wherein particles fall in towards the centre of the potential well .",
    "zeldovich approximation breaks down after orbit crossing as it does not predict any change in the direction of motion for particles , thus in this approximation particles continue to move in the same direction and the size of the collapsed region grows monotonically . in a realistic situation",
    "we expect particles to fall back towards the potential well and oscillate about it with a decreasing amplitude , and the collapsed region remains fairly compact .",
    "several approximations have been suggested to improve upon the zeldovich approximation @xcite .",
    "the adhesion approximation @xcite invokes an effective viscosity : this prevents orbit crossing and conserves momentum to ensure that pancakes remain thin and matter ends up in the correct region .",
    "this changes the character of motions in dense regions ( no orbit crossing or mixing in the phase space ) but predicts locations of these regions correctly .",
    "if one assumes that the gravitational potential evolves at the linear rate @xcite , then it can be shown that the collapsed region remains confined .",
    "the effective drag due to expanding background slows down particles and they do not have enough energy to climb out of the potential well .",
    "thus the process of confining particles to a compact collapsed region results from a combination of expansion of the universe and gravitational interaction of in falling particles .",
    "none of the approximations captures all the relevant effects .",
    "therefore we must turn to n - body simulations @xcite in order to study collapse and relaxation of perturbations in a complete manner .",
    "we will consider only gravitational effects here and ignore all other processes .",
    "we assume that the system can be described in the newtonian limit .",
    "the growth of perturbations is then described by the coupled system of euler s equation and poisson equation in comoving coordinates along with mass conservation , e.g. , see @xcite . @xmath1",
    "it is assumed that the density field is generated by a distribution of particles , each of mass @xmath2 , position @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 is the present value of hubble constant , @xmath5 is the present density parameter for non - relativistic matter and @xmath6 is the scale factor . in this paper",
    "we will consider the einstein - de sitter universe as the background , i.e. , @xmath7 .",

    "@xmath12 couples density contrasts in an indirect manner through velocities of particles ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the equation of motion still needs to be solved for a complete solution of this equation , or we can use some ansatz for velocities to make this an independent equation .    it can be shown that individual _ virialised _ objects , i.e. , objects that satisfy the condition @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the kinetic energy and @xmath16 is the potential energy , do not make any contribution towards growth of perturbations through mode coupling @xcite at much larger scales , i.e. , the @xmath17 term is zero .",
    "the contribution of mode coupling due to interaction of such objects is not known .",
    "approximate approaches to structure formation can be developed by ignoring interaction of well separated scales .",
    "the evolution of density perturbations can be modelled as a combination of non - linear collapse at small scales , and the collapsed objects can be displaced using quasi - linear approximations @xcite .",
    "these approaches yield an acceptable description of properties of collapsed objects and their distribution for a first estimate .",
    "pinocchio @xcite provides sufficient information about halo properties and merger trees for use with semi - analytic models of galaxy formation .",
    "the efficacy of these models puts an upper bound on the effects of mode coupling that we are studying here .    in this paper",
    "we simplify the system by starting with perturbations that have a non - zero amplitude only for two sets of scales .",
    "we simulate the collapse of a plane wave by starting with non - zero amplitude of perturbations for the fundamental mode of the simulation box along the @xmath18 axis , the wavenumber of the fundamental mode is denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "this serves as the large scale perturbation in our study . the amplitude for this mode",
    "is chosen so that shell crossing takes place when the scale factor @xmath20 .",
    "power spectrum for small scale fluctuations is chosen to be non - zero in a range of wave numbers @xmath21 with a constant amplitude across this window , i.e. , @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "a gaussian random realisation of this power spectrum is used for small scale fluctuations . here",
    "@xmath24 is the power per logarithmic interval in @xmath25 contributed by small scales ( large @xmath25 ) and @xmath11 is the amplitude of the fundamental mode that gives rise to the plane wave .",
    "the ratio of @xmath26 at @xmath27 and for the plane wave is denoted by @xmath28 , thus when @xmath29 collapse of perturbations at these scales happens at the same time whereas for @xmath30 perturbations at small scales collapse before the plane wave collapses .",
    "we chose the ratio @xmath31 so that there is distinct separation in the scales involved .    , we go from a single stream region to a three stream region and so on up to seven stream region near the centre . ]",
    "collapse of a plane wave of this kind leads to formation of a multi - stream region , we will also use the term pancake to describe this region .",
    "figure  [ phase_space ] shows the phase space plot for the plane wave at late stages of collapse for the simulation pm_00l ( see table 1 for details of the simulation ) .",
    "velocity of particles is plotted as a function of position , only the @xmath18 component is plotted as there is no displacement or velocity along other directions in this simulation .",
    "regions where particles with different velocities can be found are the multi - stream regions .",
    "as we approach the centre of pancake located at @xmath32 , we go from a single stream region to a three stream region and so on up to seven stream region near the centre .    in initial stages ,",
    "the mass in the pancake increases rapidly as more particles fall in . figure  [ den_plwave ] shows this in terms of over - density which increases sharply from @xmath20 to @xmath33 .",
    "a significant fraction of the total mass falls into the pancake and the infall velocities for the remaining matter are very small . in this regime",
    "the mass of the pancake is almost constant , this can be seen from the panels of figure  [ den_adh_sub ] where the mass enclosed in the pancake region is almost constant from @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",

    "the treepm simulations were run with a force softening length equal to the grid length . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in absence of any substructure the collisionless collapse retains planar symmetry and we have layers of multi - stream regions with the number of streams increasing towards the centre of the pancake .",
    "presence of small scale fluctuations can induce transverse motions and these motions are amplified in the pancake .",
    "weakly bound substructure can be torn apart due to interaction with rapidly in falling matter .",
    "on the other hand , higher average density in the multi stream region can lead to rapid growth of perturbations .",
    "it is known that pancakes are unstable to fragmentation due to growth of perturbations @xcite .",
    "the velocity field is anisotropic due to infall along one direction , hence the rate at which perturbations grows will also exhibit anisotropies .",
    "velocity dispersion along the direction of plane wave collapse is larger than the transverse direction , hence the growth of fluctuations in the transverse plane is expected to be more rapid .",
    "if the in falling material contains collapsed substructure , then gravitational interactions between these can induce large transverse velocities .",
    "this takes away kinetic energy from the direction of infall , which in turn can lead to more fragmented and thinner multi - stream region .    in the following sections we describe the numerical experiments have undertaken in detail , and test the physical ideas and expectations outlined above",
    "we used a particle - mesh code @xcite and the treepm code @xcite .",
    "some simulations were run using the parallel treepm @xcite .",
    "treepm simulations used spline softening with softening length equal to the length of a grid cell in order to ensure collisionless evolution .",
    "we used force softening assuming a spline kernel @xcite .",
    "all the simulations were carried out with @xmath35 particles .",
    "table  1 lists parameters of the simulations we have used for this paper .",
    "we have used two types of initial distribution of particles . in the _ grid _",
    "distribution particles are located at grid points before being displaced to set up the initial perturbations . _ perturbed grid",
    "_ refers to a distribution where particles are randomly displaced from the grid points @xcite , this displacement has a maximum amplitude of @xmath36 grid length .",
    "such an initial condition is needed to prevent particles from reaching the same position in plane wave collapse as such a situation is pathological for tree codes .",
    "these small displacements do not affect the power spectrum to be realised , pm_@xmath37l and t_@xmath37l were compared to test for any systematic effects .",
    "simulations t_@xmath38p and t_@xmath39p were similar to t_@xmath38l and t_@xmath39l except that the small scale fluctuations were restricted to the direction orthogonal to the direction of plane wave .",
    "thus the small scale fluctuations had the same form for all @xmath18 .",
    "these simulations are useful for differentiating between competing explanations for results outlined below .    in addition to the n - body simulations listed in table  1",
    ", we also carried out one dimensional simulations within the adhesion model @xcite with a finite viscosity following a method similar to the one outlined by weinberg and gunn ( 1990 ) .     and",
    "@xmath33 from the pm_00l simulation , dashed lines show the density profile from the t_00l simulation with the same profile . ]",
    "figure  [ den_plwave ] shows the density profile of the pancake for pm_00l and t_00l simulations at two epochs .",
    "these figures demonstrate that the density profiles in these simulations are almost identical , indeed the tiny differences can be attributed to the different initial distribution of particles .",
    "we have checked this assertion by running the pm_00l with the perturbed grid initial conditions .",
    "the treepm method has a slightly better resolution but it does not induce any new features .",
    "this is expected as the force softening length used in the treepm simulations is one grid length , same as the average inter - particle separation and it has been shown than such force softening does not induce two body collisions @xcite .",
    "we will mostly use treepm simulations for the remaining part of this study .",
    "an important indicator of the role played by substructure is the thickness of the pancake that forms by collapse of the plane wave .",
    "if substructure does not play an important role in evolution of large scale perturbations then the thickness of pancake should not change by a significant amount . on the other hand ,",
    "if substructure does indeed speed up the process of dynamical relaxation then we should see some signature in terms of the thickness of pancake , velocity structure , or both .",
    "any such effect will be apparent only at late times as infall of matter into the pancake dominates at early times .",
    "dynamical effects of substructure will become important only at late times .",

    "the boundary of the multi stream region is visible clearly in all the slices even though this region is fragmented in the last panel ( t_40l ) .",
    "it is clear that the pancake is thinner in simulations with more substructure .",
    "a more detailed comparison of simulations with different level of substructure is shown in figure  [ den_all ] .",

    "the peak over - density at the centre of the pancake is smaller in simulations with more substructure .",
    "the mass enclosed within a given distance of the centre of pancake ( defined here as the trough of the potential well of the plane wave ) is smaller for more substructure , even though the variation is very small at less than @xmath43 between the extreme cases ( see figure  [ den_adh_sub ] ) .",
    "potential wells corresponding to substructure prevent infall into the pancake region . as the amount of substructure is increased , there is visible reduction in the size of the region around the pancake where density is greater than average .",
    "the visual impression of figure  [ pthick ] is reinforced by the variation of over - density .",
    "the middle panel of figure  [ den_all ] shows the _ rms _ velocities of particles in direction transverse to the plane wave collapse as a function of the @xmath18 coordinate .",
    "as in the top panel , averaging is done over all @xmath40 and @xmath41 for a given interval @xmath42 .",
    "this plot shows that the transverse motions are enhanced in the dense pancake region .",

    "the lower panel shows the rms transverse velocities of collapsed haloes at the same epoch for t_05l ( dashed line ) , t_10l ( dot - dashed line ) , t_20l ( dotted line ) and t_40l ( dot - dot - dashed line ) . ]",
    "transverse motions are due to motions of particles in clumps that constitute substructure , due to infall of particles in these clumps , and , transverse motions of clumps as they move towards each other . in order to delineate these effects ,",
    "we have plotted the _",
    "rms _ velocities for haloes in the last panel of figure  [ den_all ] .",
    "these haloes were selected with the friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm using a linking length of @xmath44 grid length .",
    "transverse component of the velocity of centre of mass for haloes with more than @xmath45 particles was used for the figure .",
    "such a high cutoff for halo members is acceptable because typical haloes have several hundred members , see the following subsection on mass functions .",
    "differences between simulations with different amount of substructure are more pronounced than in the middle panel",
    ". for simulations with a small amount of substructure , motion of clumps is subdominant and hence the transverse motions are contributed mostly by internal motions and infall . in simulations with more substructure ,",
    "motions of clumps contribute significantly to the _ rms _ transverse velocity .",
    "gravitational attraction of clumps , particularly in close encounters in the pancake region induce the transverse component .",
    "collisions are enhanced in the pancake region as the number density of clumps is higher .    in order to convince ourselves that transverse motions induced by scattering / collision of clumps",
    "is the most likely reason for the reduced thickness of pancakes , we compare simulations t_@xmath38l and t_@xmath39l with t_@xmath38p and t_@xmath39p . in t_@xmath38p and t_@xmath39p simulations , the small scale fluctuations do not have any @xmath18 dependence .",
    "in these ( t_@xmath38p and t_@xmath39p ) simulations there are no clumps but streams of particles that are falling in and this reduces the number of scattering that take place  no @xmath18 dependence means that dense streams run into each other head on with grazing collisions happening only rarely .",
    "of course , in the simulation the presence of the plane wave leads to breaking of these streams into clumps as the streams are stretched inhomogeneously in the @xmath18 direction .",
    "these clumps are aligned parallel to the @xmath18 axis . in the pancake region scattering of these streams",
    "occasionally leads to complex patterns .    if presence of substructure and its growth in the pancake was the only cause for making the pancake thinner then pancake in these simulations should be thinner as well .",
    "figure  [ pic_lp ] shows slices from simulations t_@xmath39l and t_@xmath39p for @xmath33 .",
    "a slice from the simulation pm_@xmath37l is also plotted here for reference .",
    "this visual comparison shows that the pancake is thinner in t_@xmath39l as compared to t_@xmath39p .",
    "indeed , the thickness of pancake in t_@xmath39p and pm_@xmath37l is very similar .",
    "this reinforces the point that scattering of clumps in the pancake region is the key reason for thinner pancakes .",
    "the substructure is helping to confine the pancake to a smaller region .",
    "it is interesting to study the collapse of a plane wave in an n - body simulation and compare it with the collapse in the adhesion model @xcite with a finite effective viscosity .",
    "we first study the collapse of a plane wave in absence of any substructure , n - body simulations pm_00l for comparison with numerical simulations using the adhesion model with finite effective viscosity .",
    "one dimensional adhesion simulations were done using the plane wave with the same amplitude as the n - body simulations .",
    "we use the standard method for computing the trajectories of particles in the adhesion model @xcite , a summary of the basic formalism is reproduced here for reference .",
    "in adhesion approximation , the equation of motion for a particle is replaced by the burgers equation @xcite . in the one dimensional",
    "situation we are considering here , we have : @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the velocity of particles and @xmath48 is the linear growth factor .",
    "this equation can be solved by introducing the velocity potential @xmath49 , where @xmath50 coincides with the gravitational potential at the initial time .",

    "the solid curve shows the enclosed mass for pm_00l . in the region with a given number of streams ,",
    "the n - body curve is smooth .",
    "jumps in mass enclosed occur at transition from single stream to multi stream region , and at other transitions where the number of streams changes within the multi stream region .",
    "all other curves show @xmath58 for adhesion model : dashed curve is for @xmath62 , dotted curve is for @xmath63 and the dot - dashed curve is for @xmath64 .",

    ", the n - body curve stays around a curve for constant effective viscosity in the adhesion model .",
    "a remarkable fact is that the n - body curve for the three stream region at all the epochs follows the adhesion model curve for @xmath65 .",
    "similar behaviour is seen for the five stream region which follows @xmath66 though the range of scales and epochs over which this can be resolved is somewhat limited .",
    "addition of substructure clearly changes the character of the problem and the collapse is no longer one dimensional .",
    "however , the scale of the substructure is so small compared to the wavelength of the plane wave that the large scale collapse is still very close to planar .",
    "figure  [ den_adh_sub ] shows the mass enclosed within a distance @xmath54 from the centre of the multi stream region for simulations pm_00l , t_10l and t_40l .",
    "density is averaged over all @xmath40 and @xmath41 for this plot in the same manner as for figure  [ den_all ] .",
    "also plotted in the figure are curves for the adhesion model ( @xmath63 ) , where the calculation is done without taking substructure into account .",
    "the motivation for such a comparison is to see the effect of substructure on the favoured value of effective viscosity .",
    "substructure removes the sharp change in density at the boundaries of @xmath67-stream , @xmath68-stream and @xmath69-stream regions and the curves for t_10l and t_40l are smoother in the pancake region .",
    "the finite viscosity curve matches simulations with substructure over a wider range of scales than with pm_00l .",
    "there are no other noteworthy differences .",
    "mass function of collapsed haloes in these simulations can be used to understand the influence of plane wave collapse on substructure",
    ". collapsed structures form in these simulations primarily due to initial density fluctuations at small scales , with some modulation by the collapse of the plane wave . in this section",
    "we study the effect of the collapsing plane wave on the mass function of collapsed haloes .",
    "these haloes were selected with the friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm using a linking length of @xmath44 grid length .",
    "the initial power spectrum has a peak at the scale corresponding to @xmath70 of the simulation box , or @xmath71 grid lengths .",
    "thus typical haloes will have a lagrangian radius of about @xmath72 grid lengths and should contain about @xmath73 particles .",
    "thus a cutoff of @xmath45 or more particles for haloes is reasonable for this study .            in absence of the plane wave ,",
    "the only perturbations are at small scales .",
    "the small scale perturbations are concentrated around a given mass scale and the mass function is also peaked around this mass at early epochs . at late epochs mergers lead to formation of haloes with a larger mass and the range of masses is greater for models with a larger amplitude of fluctuations .",
    "figure  [ slices ] shows these features in the distribution of particles .",
    "these features can also be seen in figure  [ massf ] where mass fraction @xmath74 for @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 is plotted in different panels .",
    "@xmath74 is the fraction of total mass in collapsed haloes with halo mass above @xmath78 .",
    "adding the plane wave at a much larger scale than the small scale fluctuations essentially pushes much of the mass into the pancake region , leaving a small fraction of matter in the under dense regions that occupy much of the volume .",
    "growth of small scale fluctuations in the under dense regions is inhibited whereas growth of fluctuations in the pancake region is enhanced , this is seen clearly in the slices from simulations shown in figure  [ slices ] .",
    "higher background density in the pancake region leads to rapid growth of perturbations , mergers of haloes also lead to formation of massive clumps .",
    "these effects become more pronounced at late epochs and result in a shift of mass function towards larger masses , indeed haloes at two distinct mass scales are present .",
    "low mass clumps in under dense regions have the mass expected of haloes in regions where small scale fluctuation dominate whereas haloes of a much higher mass are present in the pancake region .",
    "figure  [ massf ] shows these two mass scales very clearly .",
    "total mass in collapsed haloes does not change significantly with the addition of the plane wave . indeed for simulations t_40l and t_40 , mass function is the same at @xmath75 as small scales dominate . at late times",
    "( @xmath33 ) , the effect of plane wave makes the mass function of t_05l , t_10l and t_20l similar .",
    "not surprisingly , presence of large scale power leads to formation of more massive haloes .",
    "however it does not seem to enhance the total mass in collapsed haloes .",
    "in this paper we studied the effect of substructure on collapse of a plane wave .",
    "the key conclusions of the present study of the role of substructure are :    * the pancake formed due to collapse of the plane wave is thinner if the in falling material is formed of collapsed substructure . *",
    "we show that collisions between clumps lead to enhancement of velocities transverse to the direction of large scale collapse . *",
    "we show that in simulations with substructure where collisions are suppressed , pancakes are not thinner . *",
    "thus collision induced enhancement of motions transverse to the collapsing plane wave takes away kinetic energy from the direction of infall and leads to thinner pancakes .",
    "* presence of large scale power shifts the mass function towards larger masses .",
    "there is , however , no change in the total mass in collapsed haloes .",
    "the points outlined above essentially relate to coupling of density fluctuations at well separated scales .",
    "each of these points refers to a measurable effect of such a coupling .",
    "the nature of large scale fluctuation , a single plane wave , does not allow us to estimate the effect in terms of statistical indicators like the power spectrum .",
    "we plan to study these aspects with larger ( @xmath79 ) simulations where the large scale collapse will also be generic .",
    "large , high resolution studies are needed as @xmath35 simulations with particle mesh code have not shown any large effect in power spectrum at late times @xcite .     from the centre of the multi stream region .",
    "the top panel shows the curves for @xmath33 .",
    "the thick solid curve is for the n - body simulation pm_00l .",
    "jumps in the mass enclosed occur at transition from multi stream region with @xmath80 streams to @xmath81 streams , with @xmath82 a non - zero positive integer .",
    "all other curves show @xmath58 for adhesion model : dashed curve is for @xmath62 , dotted curve is for @xmath63 and the dot - dashed curve is for @xmath64 .",
    "the middle panel shows the same set curves for @xmath60 and the lower panel is for @xmath34 . ]     from the centre of the multi stream region .",
    "the top panel shows the curves for @xmath33 .",
    "the solid curve is for n - body simulation pm_00l .",
    "other simulations are also plotted here t_10l ( dashed curve ) and t_40l ( dot - dashed curve ) .",
    "dotted curve shows the mass enclosed in the one dimensional adhesion model with @xmath63 .",
    "the lower panel shows the same set of curves for @xmath34 and the middle panel is for @xmath60 . ]     as a function of mass @xmath78 in n - body simulations .",
    "the top panel is for @xmath75 , the middle panel is for @xmath20 and the lower panel is for @xmath33 .",
    "curves are shown for t_05 ( solid curve ) , t_05l ( thick solid curve ) , t_10 ( dashed curve ) , t_10l ( thick dashed curve ) , t_20 ( dotted curve ) , t_20l ( thick dotted curve ) , t_40 ( dot - dashed curve ) and t_40l ( thick dot - dashed curve ) . ]",
    "another important point to consider is that we have considered two well separated scales for fluctuations and there is no infall once fluctuations at the larger scales collapse .",
    "numerical experiments that can shed light on effects of this feature are also required to improve our understanding of issues .",
    "we also compared the collapse of a plane wave in an n - body with the collapse in the adhesion model with a finite effective viscosity .",
    "we found that :    * the adhesion model predicts the variation of density very well with a constant effective viscosity in regions with a given number of streams . *",
    "regions with a given number of streams coincide with the adhesion model with the same value of effective viscosity at all epochs .",
