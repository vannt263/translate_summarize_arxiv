    "quantum correlation is believed to be a unique property possessed by a quantum system and plays an essential role in quantum information theory .",
    "traditionally , studies on quantum correlation have mainly focused on entanglement @xcite , which is considered to be a crucial resource for the vast majority of quantum information processing .",
    "however , not all advantages of quantum information tasks attribute to quantum entanglement . for example , the deterministic quantum computation with one qubit model is believed to estimate the trace of a unitary matrix more efficiently than any classical information processors , whereas there is little or no entanglement during the whole processing @xcite .",
    "this implies the possible presence of other type of , beyond quantum entanglement , quantum correlation measured by quantum discord in separable ( unentangled ) state @xcite .",
    "even though quantum discord has attracted considerable attention in quantum information theory involving quantum computation @xcite , dynamics of quantum discord @xcite , operational interpretations of quantum discord @xcite , etc , only geometric quantum discord ( gqd ) defined by the distance between a general quantum state and its closest classical state is analytically calculative in mathematics @xcite .",
    "however , can we directly measure the gqd in experiment ?",
    "it seems not to be an easy work , since the quantum discord is a complicated nonlinear function of the density matrix of the state . to the best of our knowledge , the only method used to exactly estimate the value of quantum discord in laboratory is the so - called quantum state tomography ( qst ) @xcite , where one has to measure a complete set of observables to reconstruct the density matrix , and then evaluates the exact value of quantum discord by mathematical measure",
    "it is obvious that the number of observables will grow exponentially with the increasing dimension .",
    "another more direct method is the witness of quantum discord , but unfortunately it requires some _ priori _ knowledge on the state to be detected @xcite and only provides a lower bound of quantum discord @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an experimental scheme to directly measure the geometric quantum discord of a completely unknown two - qubit state .",
    "the present scheme can be used to measure the exact value of gqd rather than its lower bound .",
    "in addition , the gqd is measured by estimation of three parameters in joint measurements of a small number ( not more than six ) of copies .",
    "compared with qst , our scheme has the following advantages : ( i ) our scheme requires less projective measurements than qst ; ( ii ) in our scheme we only need to estimate 3 parameters instead of 15 parameters as done in qst ; ( iii ) the gqd can be obtained with only local projective measurements on subsystems with the assistance of classical communications .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we firstly give a brief review of the gqd , and then we demonstrate the scheme for directly measuring of gqd of a two - qubit state in detail .",
    "the conclusion is drawn finally .",
    "in ref . @xcite , daki@xmath0 _ et al . _ introduced the gqd to measure the quantum correlation from the geometric perspective , which has the following form , @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the set of classical ( zero - discord ) states and @xmath3 stands for the square norm in the hilbert - schmidt space . in particular , it is possible to obtain an explicit expression of gqd for a general two - qubit state @xcite . in the bloch representation , a two - qubit state @xmath4 can be written as follows , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the identity matrix , @xmath7 are the pauli matrices , @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the components of the local bloch vectors @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , and @xmath12 are components of correlation matrix @xmath13 .",
    "the classical state in @xmath2 is of the form @xmath14 with @xmath15 , then the gqd of @xmath4 is given as @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the superscript @xmath20 denotes the transpose of vectors or matrices .",
    "the gqd presented in eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) can be rewritten as follows , @xmath21 where @xmath22 s are the eigenvalues of matrix @xmath23 . in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ d1 ] ) , we have adopted the facts @xmath24 and @xmath19 .",
    "recall that the gqd is not a symmetric measure under the permutation of the subsystems , if we choose the zero - discord state in the form of @xmath25 , then the gqd of @xmath4 under a permutation of the subsystems is given as @xmath26 with @xmath27 being the eigenvalue of matrix @xmath28 .",
    "without loss of generality , we will mainly focus on the measurement of @xmath29 in the following discussions .      in this subsection",
    ", we will demonstrate our scheme explicitly . from eq .",
    "( [ d1 ] ) we can see that the acquirement of the eigenvalues of matrix @xmath23 is sufficient to estimate the gqd of @xmath4 , this can be achieved if we can obtain the moments @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "although it is known that nonlinear functions of the state parameters can not be directly obtained by performing measurement on a single copy , we can try to estimate them with several copies .",
    "in fact , such an approach has been used in detecting the entanglement of an unknown quantum state @xcite . in our scheme , in order to obtain each @xmath32 we need @xmath33 copies of states at each steps . for conciseness , we employ @xmath34 to denote the @xmath35th copy and @xmath36,@xmath37 to denote the subsystems of each copy , hereinafter .",
    "let us start with the attainment of @xmath38 , in this procedure we need 2 copies for each projective measurement .",
    "because @xmath38 is defined as the summation of the eigenvalues of @xmath23 which mathematically equals to the trace of @xmath23 , we have @xmath39 . taking into accounts the expressions of @xmath10 and @xmath13 , @xmath38 can be written as follows , @xmath40\\cr\\cr & & + \\sum_{i , j=1}^3[\\mathrm{tr}(\\sigma^i_{a_1}\\otimes \\sigma^j_{b_1})\\rho_{a_1b_1}\\cdot\\mathrm{tr}(\\sigma^i_{a_2}\\otimes \\sigma^j_{b_2})\\rho_{a_2b_2}]\\cr\\cr & = & \\mathrm{tr}\\sum_{i=1}^3(\\sigma^i_{a_1}\\otimes\\sigma^i_{a_2}\\otimes\\mathbb{i}_{b_1}\\otimes\\mathbb{i}_{b_2})(\\rho_{a_1b_1}\\otimes\\rho_{a_2b_2})\\cr\\cr & & + \\mathrm{tr}\\sum_{i , j=1}^3(\\sigma^i_{a_1}\\otimes\\sigma^i_{a_2}\\otimes\\sigma^j_{b_1}\\otimes\\sigma^j_{b_2})(\\rho_{a_1b_1}\\otimes\\rho_{a_2b_2})\\cr\\cr & = & \\mathrm{tr}[(u_{a_1a_2}\\otimes v_{b_1b_2})(\\rho_{a_1b_1}\\otimes\\rho_{a_2b_2})],\\label{m1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the last equal sign of eq .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) , we have defined @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 with @xmath45 and here @xmath46 .",
    "it is obvious that the operators @xmath47 and @xmath48 are local two - qubit operators that performed on subsystems @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "similarly , we can represent @xmath49 and @xmath50 in terms of the expectation values of the tensor products of @xmath47 and @xmath48 with 4 and 6 copies of states , respectively .",
    "the results are given as follows , @xmath51,\\label{m2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath52.\\label{m3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    by substituting eqs .",
    "( [ u ] ) and ( [ v ] ) to eqs .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) , ( [ m2 ] ) , and ( [ m3 ] ) , we can represent each @xmath32 in terms of the sum of the tensor products of @xmath53 , each term in the summation corresponds to a joint measurement on the multiple copies .",
    "it is interesting that the joint measurements are composed of a number of projective measurement which are performed on two qubits in the same subsystem , that means the value of @xmath32 can be obtained by performing a set of local two - qubit projective measurements . although the new expressions of @xmath32 s seem to be complex , even tedious , they can be simplified since the outcomes of the joint measurements are not independent .",
    "after simple calculations , we find that only @xmath54 projective measurements are required . the number of the projective measurements is less than that required in qst .",
    "the @xmath54 required projectors are given as follows , see also fig .",
    "[ 1 ] ,    th row denotes the @xmath55th copy of state @xmath34 .",
    "the blue solid curve connecting two circles denotes the operator @xmath56 and the blue dashed curve denotes the identity operator @xmath6 .",
    "for example , the last subplot demonstrates the projective measurements @xmath57 . ]    for 2 copies case : @xmath58 for 4 copies case : @xmath59 for 6 copies case : @xmath60    set the outcome of projective measurement @xmath61 is @xmath62 , then the values of @xmath32 are given as follows , @xmath63 thus , we have obtained the moments @xmath32 s with direct projective measurements , the eigenvalues @xmath22 s can be sequentially determined from the moments using the techniques of ref .",
    "note that we can also obtain the moments of @xmath64 by interchanging @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 with @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , respectively , in eq .",
    "( [ m123 ] ) .    in the analysis above",
    ", we find that in principle the gqd can be directly and locally measured in experiment .",
    "this will be valuable for the case of the correlated qubits are shared by two distant participants .",
    "moreover , different from the previous works on entanglement detection , which requires projective measurements on multiple - qubit space in certain steps @xcite , the measurements involved in our scheme are all two - qubit projective measurements , which is more feasible in experiments , for instance , the two - qubit projective measurements have already been used for detection of lower bounds of entanglement in photonic systems @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have also roughly compared our scheme with qst utilizing the criterion mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite . in our scheme ,",
    "the number of the parameters to be measured , @xmath71 , is @xmath72 , which is less than that in qst , @xmath73 . in this sense",
    "we can say that our scheme is parametrically efficient .",
    "when the number of copies , @xmath74 , is concerned , our scheme is a little more consumptive than qst , that is , in each `` round '' of our scheme the number of consumed copies is larger than that in qst ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "however , the factor @xmath76 is here ( @xmath77 ) less than for the qst schemes ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "finally , we give a brief discussion on the experimental implementation of our scheme . as an example",
    ", we restrict our discussions in photonic system , which has mature manipulation techniques and widely applications in quantum information processing .",
    "the required two - qubit projective measurements can be easily realized with the help of beam splitters and single - photon detectors .",
    "there also exists two challenges in the experimental implementation : the preparation of the identical copies of an unknown state and the simultaneity of the performance of joint projective measurements .",
    "we adopt the method mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite to overcome these two points .",
    "the correlated photon pairs sequentially generated by the same photon source ( undergo the same decoherence channel ) are sent into different optical pathes , and by carefully arranging the lengthes of these optical pathes the photons belong to the same subsystem but generated at different times will arrive at the measuring device simultaneously . as a consequence ,",
    "both the requirements of the identity of copies and the coincidence of measurements are satisfied . in addition , since the measurement settings for @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 can also be used to perform the other @xmath82 projective measurements , we need only three measurement settings .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the exact gqd for an arbitrary unknown two - qubit state instead of a lower bound can be directly and locally measured in experiment , provided that not more than six copies of states to be measured are available .",
    "furthermore , our scheme is parametrically efficient than the widely adopted qst scheme since we need measure only 3 parameters , _",
    "i.e. _ , three moments of matrix @xmath23 , to obtain the quantum discord . moreover , the attainment of quantum discord can be achieved by local projective measurements and classical communications , the number of projective measurements is less than that required in qst . in particular ,",
    "these measurements are all projected onto two - qubit space which can be easily implemented in experiments .",
    "we also expect that the basic idea of our scheme may provide a new point of view to understand the quantum correlation .",
