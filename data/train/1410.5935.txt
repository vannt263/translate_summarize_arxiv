    "apolarity provides the ground for the study of the simplest type of invariant , generalizing in higher degree the notion of harmonic quadrics .",
    "the geometric implications of apolarity are surprising and multifold , see for instance @xcite",
    ". a celebrated result due to grace and heawood asserts that the complex zeros of two apolar polynomials can not be separated by a circle or a straight line . as a matter of fact ,",
    "this zero location property is equivalent to apolarity @xcite .",

    "it is natural and convenient to symmetrize the polynomials @xmath6 and @xmath7 and interpret both apolarity and fischer inner products in terms of the roots of these polynomials . in this direction",
    "an observation due to walsh establishes a powerful equivalent statement to grace s theorem , known as the walsh coincidence theorem : if a monic polynomial @xmath6 of degree @xmath2 has no zeros in a circular domain @xmath8 ( that is a disc , complement of a disk , a half - space , open or closed ) , then its symmetrization has no zeros in @xmath9 , @xcite . in its turn",
    ", walsh s theorem explains and offers a natural framework for a series of polynomial inequalities , in one or several variables @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present note is to study the pull - back of the apolarity invariant by a polynomial mapping @xmath10 of degree @xmath11 .",

    "we prove below that a majorization on the diagonal of @xmath14 is transmitted , with the same constant , to the polydomain @xmath18 .",
    "the operator @xmath12 representing the @xmath10-apolarity form is complex symmetric , in the sense of @xcite , and as a consequence the eigenfunctions of its modulus are doubly orthogonal , both in the fischer norm , and with respect to the apolarity bilinear form .",
    "in particular the zeros of these polynomials can not be separated by higher degree algebraic sets deduced from the boundaries of @xmath14 , respectively @xmath17 .",
    "the idea of providing a more flexible version of grace s theorem also relates to recent work of b.  and h.  sendov in @xcite , which is concerned with finding minimal domains satisfying the statement of grace s theorem for a given polynomial .",
