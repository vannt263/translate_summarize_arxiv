    "quantum decoherence is a common and inevitable phenomenon in an open quantum system due to its interaction with the surrounding bath or environment .",
    "an initial superposition state of the system , @xmath0 , has to decay into a classical mixture of states , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , after a decoherence time @xmath3 . during the same period of time",
    ", some of the information in the initial state of the system might irreversibly lose into the bath @xcite . a real - world system , for instance a quantum device or qubit , can not be completely isolated from the environment . in the last two decades",
    ", there are great interests in the search for realizations of _ quantum computation _ as well as _ quantum communications _ , such technologies rely on the possibilities that quantum devices can be manufactured with negligible decoherence in the period of operation .",
    "since decoherence is intrinsic to open quantum systems , the problem is transformed to a problem on how to reduce or eliminate the decoherence of an open quantum system .",
    "many works have been devoted into the research of the influences caused by the subsystem - bath coupling and the decoherence dynamics of open quantum systems @xcite , for the possible realizations of quantum communication and quantum computation . +",
    "a very important part of any theoretical research of decoherence is the modeling of the bath or environment .",
    "there had been mainly two important types of bath schemes : ( i ) the bath consisted of harmonic oscillators , e.g. , the caldeira - leggett model @xcite ; ( ii ) the bath made up of spins-1/2 , e.g. , model used in ref .",
    "for both types of bath model , there are typically two kinds of approximations , markovian @xcite or non - markovian @xcite , used in the studies .",
    "the focus of most of the researches were on the eliminating the destructive effects of the environment to the system . however , tessieri and wilkie proposed a new idea to the reducing of decoherence @xcite of the open subsystem , which is a spin-1/2 coupled to a low - temperature bath of spins .",
    "they introduced the coupling terms between bath spins into their spin - bath hamiltonian , which is a simplification of the vibronic hamiltonian of the impurity and crystal @xcite using spin-1/2 modes .",
    "one of the most important results they found is that the strong antiferromagnetic intra - bath interactions could be utilized to make the dynamics of the central spin almost autonomous from the bath around . and dawson et al .",
    "@xcite also found the decoherence effect of the bath can be suppressed by the increasing intra - bath coupling in tessieri - wilkie model . +",
    "inspired by their works and the papers of xiang et al .",
    "@xcite and liu et al .",
    "@xcite , the aim of this paper is to study the dynamics of correlation characteristics between the _ two _ coupled center spins , which constitute our subsystem .",
    "the bath in our study is the same model used by the ref .",
    "@xcite , which is prepared in a thermal equilibrium state at time @xmath4 .",
    "the dynamics of the subsystem and the bath then calculated , phenomena such as decoherence oscillation were observed , which can be quantified by the amplitudes of polarization components @xmath5 , @xmath6 and",
    "@xmath7 . we studied the evolution of the spatial correlation between polarizations of the two subsystem spins along three directions @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we also discussed the entanglement between the two system spins @xcite , which is an essential ingredient in the quantum communication @xcite and has no classical counterpart .",
    "the concurrence of the subsystem was chosen to be a measure of the entanglement between the two spins within the subsystem @xcite .",
    "it will be demonstrated that in our extended model , both the polarization correlation and entanglement of the subsystem can be restored to a great extent to the isolated case by the increasing pairwise couplings between the bath spins .",
    "and we also try to clarify the physics behind this revival function of intra - bath coupling .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ hamiltonian ] , we introduce the hamiltonian for our two - center - spins - spin - bath model ; in section [ calculation ] , we explain the computation procedures about the evolution of the correlation and of the concurrence for the subsystem ; detailed results and discussions are in section [ discussion ] ; the conclusion of our study is given in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the subsystem we studied here consists of two spins antiferromagneticly coupled in the @xmath11 direction , and aligned in @xmath11 and @xmath12 direction respectively by applied fields .",
    "the bath consists of @xmath13 spins , every pair of the spins are also coupled antiferromagneticly in the @xmath11 direction , and aligned in both @xmath11 and @xmath12 direction .",
    "the subsystem interacts with the bath by the antiferromagnetic coupling in the @xmath11 direction .",
    "this model is an extension to the tessieri - wilkie model @xcite , which comes from the simplification of an experimentally realizable model system .",
    "the original model is based on the system that an interstitial he atom in an otherwise pure silicon or diamond cluster , the he atom causing small lattice distortion in the cluster @xcite , thus inducing vibronic coupling between the electronic states and phonon states of the cluster .",
    "this mechanism is further simplified by considering only the ground state and the first excited state of the interstitial he atom , representing the states with a spin-1/2 pauli matrix , and representing the phonon states as spin-1/2 modes , which resulting in the tessieri - wilkie model .",
    "this model system is regarded as a potential realization for quantum computing device .",
    "our extension is that instead of one center spin , we have two center spins coupled together by an antiferromagnetic coupling . in this extension",
    "we merely regard the tessieri - wilkie model as a model system and did not go into details of the physical realization . so that we will only focus our attention to the extended model itself in the following discussions .",
    "+ the hamiltonian of our system can be written as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the hamiltonian of the subsystem with two interacting spins ( labeled by 1,2 ) coupled in @xmath11 direction with coupling strength @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 may be regarded as applied fields acting in @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions to the sub - system and bath spins .",
    "the @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the pauli matrices : @xmath22 the bath consists of @xmath13 spins labeled by @xmath23 to @xmath24 , coupled each other in the @xmath11 direction with coupling strength @xmath25 , denoted as @xmath26 .",
    "the coupling between subsystem and bath is given by @xmath27 , which is also the coupling of each subsystem spin with every bath spin in @xmath11 direction , with coupling strength @xmath28 .",
    "all the interactions are antiferromagnetic , that is @xmath29 in the following calculation , we use the system of units where the boltzmann constant @xmath30 and plank constant @xmath31 . the other parameters in the hamiltonian take the following values in the subsequent computations : @xmath32",
    "in this section , we describe in detail the algorithms for the calculation of the dynamics of the subsystem modeled by the hamiltonian ( [ whole ] ) .",
    "the initial state of the subsystem is chosen to be one of the four bell states : @xmath33 and @xmath34 refer to the spin `` down '' and spin `` up '' in the @xmath12 direction , respectively .",
    "the reason that we use these states as initial states is that among all the quantum states for a pair of coupled spin-1/2 , bell bases have the largest degree of entanglement and many other interesting characteristics @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that the last bell state given in equation ( [ bell4 ] ) is a state free from the bath , the action of the interaction part of the hamiltonian , @xmath27 , on the state gives zero . so that the state will evolve with time just as an isolated system .",
    "further more , the state is also an eigenstate of the subsystem hamiltonian @xmath35 : @xmath36 the time evolution of the state is simply an exponential factor @xmath37 , with @xmath38 . so that the physical quantities will not vary with time in this state and we will not consider it in the following calculations .",
    "the initial state of the bath is taken to be the thermal equilibrium state : @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the partition function of the environment @xmath41 .",
    "the density matrix @xmath42 of the whole system can formally be represented as : @xmath43 in order to find the density matrix @xmath42 , we follow the method suggested by tessieri et al @xcite .",
    "the thermal bath state @xmath44 can be expanded with the eigenstates of the environment hamiltonian : @xmath45 here @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , are the eigenstates of the environment hamiltonian @xmath26 , and @xmath49 the corresponding eigen energies . with this expansion ,",
    "the density matrix @xmath42 can be written as : @xmath50 where @xmath51 the initial state is @xmath52 the evolution operator @xmath53 can be evaluated by the efficient algorithm of polynomial schemes @xcite .",
    "the method used in this calculation is the laguerre polynomial expansion method we proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is pretty well suited to this problem and can give accurate result in a comparatively smaller computation load .",
    "more precisely , the evolution operator @xmath53 is expanded in terms of the laguerre polynomial of the hamiltonian as : @xmath54 where @xmath55 distinguishes different types of laguerre polynomials @xcite , @xmath56 is the order of the laguerre polynomial . in real calculations",
    "the expansion has to be cut at some value of @xmath57 , which was taken to be @xmath58 in this study . with the largest order of the expansion fixed",
    ", the time step @xmath59 is restricted to some value in order to get accurate results of the evolution operator . for longer times",
    "the evolution can be achieved by more steps .",
    "the action of the laguerre polynomial of hamiltonian to the states is calculated by recurrence relations of the laguerre polynomial .",
    "the efficiency of this polynomial scheme @xcite is about @xmath60 times as that of the runge - kutta algorithm used in ref .",
    "@xcite . when the states @xmath61 are obtained , the density matrix can be obtained by performing a summation in equation ( [ equ:2 m ] ) .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ n8l4t01 ]    when the temperature is not very high , the weights for high energy states will be very small so that only few lowest states need to be considered .",
    "the maximum states to be included in the summation can be determined by setting a threshold of weight @xmath63 , and keep only those states whose weight @xmath64 . as an example , table ( [ n8l4t01 ] ) gives the number of states to be used for different temperatures and threshold . in this case",
    "the number of environment spins @xmath65 , and couplings among the environment spins @xmath66 .",
    "as can be seen from the table , the number of states needed is much less than the total number of states , @xmath67 . in real calculation",
    "the up bound of the summation in equation ( [ equ:2 m ] ) will be @xmath68 , chosen by the criteria specified for the accuracy of results .",
    "that is to say , equation ( [ equ:2 m ] ) could be changed into the following equation : @xmath69    after obtaining the density matrix of the whole system , the reduced density matrix is calculated by a partial trace operation to @xmath42 , which trace out the degrees of freedom of the environment : @xmath70 for the model of this paper , @xmath71 is the density matrix of the open subsystem consists of two center spins , which can be expressed as a @xmath72 matrix in the hilbert space of the subsystem spanned by the orthonormal vectors @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 . + after the reduced density matrix is obtained , any physical quantities of the subsystem can be obtained easily . in the following we concentrate on two important physical quantities of the subsystem which reflect the decoherence and entanglement degree of the subsystem state .",
    "these two quantities are the spatial polarization correlation and the concurrence .",
    "the polarization of either spin in the subsystem is defined as @xmath77 where @xmath78 . to simplify the calculation , we may also trace out one of the spin degrees of freedom to obtain the @xmath79 sub - reduced density matrix for each spin : @xmath80 here @xmath81 means to trace out the other degrees of freedom of @xmath82 , i.e. trace out @xmath83 when @xmath84 and trace out @xmath85 when @xmath86 .",
    "then the three components of @xmath87 are expressed as : @xmath88 the polarization @xmath89 may be viewed as an indicator of quantum decoherence . + the correlation between the two subsystem spins can be described by the correlation functions defined bellow : @xmath90 where @xmath91 , @xmath92 . since @xmath93 , so that @xmath94 , the correlation function is thus also a measurement of the fluctuations of the total spin of the system .",
    "the concurrence of the two spin-1/2 system is an indicator of their intra entanglement , which is defined as @xcite : @xmath95 where @xmath96 are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the product matrix @xmath97 in decreasing order .",
    "equation ( [ concurrence ] ) applies to all kinds of states , either mixed or pure .",
    "the matrix @xmath98 is constructed as @xmath99 .",
    "if the bipartite quantum state @xmath100 is pure @xcite , such as the states in equations ( [ bell1])([bell4 ] ) . they can be written as : @xmath101 ) could be simplified to @xmath102",
    "in this section we give the calculated results of polarization correlations and concurrence with discussions . in all the calculations given here , the parameters @xmath103 unless otherwise specified . and the temperature is set as @xmath104 much higher than @xmath105 in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to stress the generality of the algorithm and conclusion .",

    "will also be considered , in which there is a strong decoherence occurs and the subsystem initial state is beyond retrieval .      , @xmath55 is @xmath11 , @xmath108 or @xmath12 , between the two spins in the subsystem .",

    "+ it is clear from the figures that when the subsystem coupled to the bath , all the polarization correlations are different from the isolated systems .",
    "the difference reflects the influences of the bath and decoherence of the subsystem .",
    "however , as pointed out in reference @xcite and @xcite for the case of a single spin system , the coupling strength among environment spins can suppress the decoherence and partially restore the subsystem coherence .",
    "figure [ fig:1xx ] through figure [ fig:3zz ] are plots of the polarization correlations as function of the time with different initial states and increasing intra - bath coupling strength . at weak intra - bath coupling ,",
    "the results are drastically different from the isolated systems and similar with figure [ fig2:n60 ] ; as the intra - bath coupling is increased , the difference between the open subsystem and the isolated system becomes smaller ; and at very strong strengths , the difference becomes very small especially in the case of @xmath115 .",
    "the other two initial bell states will be dissipated when time is elongated .",
    "these results suggest that by changing the bath coupling strength , one can effectively control the subsystem coherence properties .",
    "the suppression of decoherence effect is also depends on the number of bath spins , it is found that the more bath spins , the less effective of suppression of the decoherence with the same bath coupling strength . to show this",

    "the values of other parameters are the same as before . through the comparison of figure [ fig : n6:x6 ] with figure [ fig:2xx6 ]",
    ", we see that when @xmath114 , @xmath116 is almost sufficient to recover the isolated case except a slightly elongated period ( see figure [ fig:2xx6 ] ) , but when @xmath118 is increased to @xmath119 , the coupling strength need to be increased at least to @xmath117 to get the same effect ( see figure [ fig : n6:x10 ] ) .",

    "con1 ] , [ fig : con2 ] and [ fig : con3 ] we plot the time evolution of the concurrence of three bell states for the isolated subsystem .",
    "an example that the subsystem - bath coupling is considered but the intra - bath coupling strength is zero is showed by figure [ fig2:n6c0 ] , which can be compared with figure [ fig2:n6c ] because of the same compaction condition except @xmath25 .",

    "there are visible improvements of the concurrence by increasing the coupling strength of the bath spins .",
    "however , it is found that the influence of the same coupling strengths of bath spins has less effect on the concurrence than on the polarization correlations . from the figure",
    "we see that even for the strength @xmath117 , the concurrences are still somewhat different from the isolated cases . it is also noted that the influence is different for different initial stats",
    ", it can be seen from figure [ fig2:n6c ] that for the case of bell state @xmath113 , much better suppression of decoherence is observed than the other two states .",
    "thus we provided the results for a larger bath with the initial state @xmath115 in figure [ fig2:n8c ] , where there are @xmath65 bath spins .",
    "we found as @xmath125 , the evolution of concurrence approaches the dynamics of subsystem evolving in isolation .",
    "all the results of comparison in the above suggest that if we did not consider the intra - bath coupling , or we can not control the intra - bath coupling , the decoherence occurring in our subsystem due to the bath is very severe .",
    "although the numbers of bath spins in our simulation is not very big , but these bath spins can be regarded as the nearest - neighbors to our open subsystem , the interaction between them @xmath28 is much larger than the coupling exists between subsystem spin and other degree of freedom in the real - world environment .",
    "so the bath we considered in this study could form a safeguard device of the open subsystem , which intra - coupling could be adjusted to a high level to counteract the dissipation by itself and the real - world environment .",
    "+ to understand the physics behind the decoherence suppression effects due to the strong coupling among bath spins , we investigated the states of the bath when the coupling strength changed .",
    "the bath spins coupled antiferromagneticly with each other in the @xmath11 direction , which cause the bath spins in a kind of frustrated state .",
    "the other terms in the hamiltonian favors a aligned ordered state .",
    "the final state is the competition between the different terms as well as the thermal fluctuations and turns out to be very complex . however ,",
    "we believe that the decoherence suppression effects are somehow related to the state ordering of the bath spins . + at temperatures not high enough , the properties of the bath are determined by the few lowest energy levels , so we will concentrate on the lowest energy levels and try to figure out the characteristics of the states . in our representation where the @xmath12 component of the spin is diagonal , it is hard to see the ordering properties of the states . since the coupling is in the @xmath11 direction , we thus transform our states to the @xmath11 component diagonal representation for clarity .",
    "this is simply achieved by the following recipe to each spin state , @xmath126 where @xmath127 is a @xmath128 matrix defined as @xmath129    now we consider a system with @xmath119 bath spins and two spins in the subsystem , the bath states can be expanded with the product state of the form @xmath130 , here @xmath131 equals @xmath132 or @xmath85 , the subscript @xmath11 means the @xmath11-component diagonal representation , and @xmath133 are the index of the @xmath119 bath spins .",
    "there are @xmath134 product states , and for each product state , the subsystem can be in four states @xmath135 , @xmath136,@xmath137 and @xmath138 . since the hamiltonian @xmath26 is invariant under permutations of the bath spins , so that the states with the same number of `` up '' spins in the @xmath11 direction has the same expectation values of energy , thus we can group the states with the same number of `` up '' spins together . and using the number of `` up '' spins @xmath139 to represent such states and denote it as @xmath140 .    , the total number of bath states is @xmath112 .",
    "the initial subsystem state is @xmath110 and temperature @xmath104.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    the probability that each kind of the product states appear in the bath state can be determined from the full density matrix @xmath42 , i.e. @xmath141 the @xmath142 means to trace out the subsystem degrees of freedom . in the case of 6 bath spins , we calculated the probabilities for each state @xmath140 and found that the state @xmath143 , which has @xmath23 spins `` up '' and @xmath23 spins `` down '' in the @xmath11 direction , has the majority probability , and the probability increases with the coupling strength .",
    "figure [ fig : prob ] is the plot of the probability @xmath144 .",
    "we see that for small coupling strength , the probability is about @xmath145 , and as the coupling strength increases , the probability increases monotonically and reaches @xmath146 at @xmath147 , where the big suppression effects was obtained .",
    "based on this observation we conclude that as the coupling strength increases , the bath spins are self organized to a resonant antiferromagnetic ordered state in @xmath11 direction , one half of the spins are in the `` up '' state and the other half are in the `` down '' state .",
    "it is this ordering that brings the subsystem to the more coherent state .",
    "this mechanism may play an important role in the controlling of the subsystem coherence of quantum device , despite the inevitable influences of thermal noise upon the quantum device , we may also couple the quantum device to a system as described in this paper . by changing the coupling strength of the added bath spins , one may reduce the decoherence to a level for practical applications .",
