    "the kamland experiment @xcite turns to confirm the large - mixing - angle ( lma ) mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) solution @xcite to the long - standing solar neutrino problem .",
    "in addition , the k2k long - baseline experiment @xcite has unambiguously observed a reduction of @xmath3 flux and a distortion of the energy spectrum .",
    "these new measurements , together with the compelling sno evidence @xcite for the flavor conversion of solar @xmath4 neutrinos and the super - kamiokande evidecne @xcite for the deficit of atmospheric @xmath3 neutrinos , convinces us that the hypothesis of neutrino oscillations is actually correct !",
    "we are then led to the conclusion that neutrinos are massive and lepton flavors are mixed .    the mixing of lepton flavors means a mismatch between neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath5 and neutrino flavor eigenstates @xmath6 in the basis where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal : @xmath7 the matrix elements @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 can simply be related to the mixing factors of solar @xcite , atmospheric @xcite and chooz reactor @xcite neutrino oscillations in the following way : @xmath12 taking account of the unitarity of @xmath0 , one may reversely express @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath13 in terms of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite : @xmath17 current experimental information on @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 allows us to get very instructive constraints on the lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath0 .",
    "one purpose of this paper is therefore to examine how accurately we can recast @xmath0 from the present kamland , k2k , sno , super - kamiokande and chooz measurements .",
    "another purpose of this paper is to confront two - zero textures of the neutrino mass matrix with the new kamland data , so as to single out the most favorable texture(s ) in phenomenology . in the flavor basis chosen above",
    ", the majorana neutrino mass matrix can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 ( for @xmath20 ) are physical masses of three neutrinos . in the assumption of the lma solution for solar neutrino oscillations ,",
    "a classification of @xmath1 with two vanishing entries has been done in an analytically approximate way @xcite .",
    "our present analysis is different from the previous ones in two important aspects : ( 1 ) we carry out a careful numerical analysis of every two - zero pattern of the neutrino mass matrix @xmath1 to pin down its complete parameter space , because simple analytical approximations are sometimes unable to reveal the whole regions of relevant parameters allowed by new experimental data ; ( 2 ) we present the quantitative predictions for allowed ranges of the absolute neutrino masses , the majorana phases of @xmath2 violation , and the effective masses of the tritium beta decay ( @xmath21 ) and neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath22 ) .    the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows . with the help of current data ,",
    "we derive the model - independent constraints on nine elements of the lepton flavor mixing matrix in section ii .",
    "section iii is devoted to a detailed analysis of the parameter space for every two - zero texture of the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "we obtain instructive predictions for the neutrino mass spectrum and majorana phases of @xmath2 violation as well as @xmath21 and @xmath22 in section iv .",
    "finally a brief summary is given in section v.",
    "as already shown in eq . ( 3 ) , five matrix elements of @xmath0 can be determined or constrained from current experimental data .",
    "the other four matrix elements ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) are entirely unrestricted , however , unless one of them or the rephasing invariant of @xmath2 violation of @xmath0 ( defined as @xmath27 @xcite ) is measured . a realistic way to get rough but useful constraints on those four unknown elements is to allow the dirac phase of @xmath2 violation in @xmath0 to vary between 0 and @xmath28 @xcite , such that one can find out the maximal and minimal magnitudes of each matrix element .",
    "to see this point more clearly , we adopt the standard parametrization @xmath29 @xcite , where @xmath30 with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and so on ; and @xmath33 the advantage of this representation is that the neutrinoless double beta decay is associated with the majorana phases @xmath34 and @xmath35 , while @xmath2 violation in normal neutrino oscillations depends separately on the dirac phase @xmath36 .",
    "note that three mixing angles @xmath37 , which are all arranged to lie in the first quadrant , can be written as @xmath38 it is then straightforward to obtain @xmath39 varying the dirac phase @xmath36 from 0 to @xmath28 , we are led to the _ most generous _ ranges of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 : @xmath40 note that the lower and upper bounds of each matrix element turn to coincide with each other in the limit @xmath41 . because of the smallness of @xmath10 , the ranges obtained in eq .",
    "( 9 ) should be quite restrictive .",
    "hence it makes sense to recast the lepton flavor mixing matrix even in the absence of any experimental information on @xmath2 violation .    in view of the present experimental data from kamland @xcite , k2k @xcite , sno @xcite , super - kamiokande @xcite and chooz @xcite , we have @xmath42 @xcite , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 at the @xmath45 confidence level .",
    "namely , @xmath46 using these inputs , we calculate the numerical ranges of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath13 from eq .",
    "then the allowed ranges of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be found with the help of eq .",
    "our numerical results are summarized as @xmath47 this result is certainly more restrictive than that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite before the kamland measurement .",
    "note that the rephasing invariant of @xmath2 violation reads as follows : @xmath48 the term proportional to @xmath49 in @xmath27 , which may correct the leading term up to @xmath50 ( for @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) , were not taken into account in ref .",
    "@xcite . by use of eq .",
    "( 10 ) , we find @xmath53 .",
    "this result implies that the magnitude of @xmath27 can maximally be 0.039 , leading probably to observable @xmath2-violating effects in long - baseline neutrino oscillations .",
    "the symmetric neutrino mass matrix @xmath1 totally has six independent complex entries .",
    "if two of them vanish , i.e. , @xmath54 , we obtain two constraint equations : @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 run over @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , but @xmath63 . solving eq .",
    "( 12 ) , we arrive at @xcite @xmath64 this result implies that two neutrino mass ratios @xmath65 and two majorana - type @xmath2-violating phases @xmath66 can fully be determined in terms of three mixing angles @xmath37 and the dirac - type @xmath2-violating phase @xmath67 .",
    "thus one may examine whether a two - zero texture of @xmath1 is empirically acceptable or not by comparing its prediction for the ratio of two neutrino mass - squared differences with the result extracted from current experimental data on solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations : @xmath68 considering the lma msw solution confirmed by the kamland measurement , we have @xmath69 @xcite at the @xmath45 confidence level . in addition",
    ", we have @xmath70 @xcite at the @xmath45 confidence level . thus we arrive at @xmath71 .",
    "the allowed ranges of three mixing angles @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 have been given in eq .",
    "there is no experimental constraint on the @xmath2-violating phase @xmath36 .",
    "hence we simply take @xmath36 from @xmath75 to @xmath76 in our numerical calculations .",
    "there are totally fifteen distinct topologies for the structure of @xmath1 with two independent vanishing entries , as shown in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "we work out the explicit expressions of @xmath77 and @xmath78 for each pattern of @xmath1 by use of eq .",
    "( 14 ) , and list the results in the same tables @xcite . with the input values of @xmath79 ,",
    "@xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath36 mentioned above , we calculate the ratio @xmath82 and examine whether it is in the range allowed by current data .",
    "this criterion has been used in refs .",
    "@xcite to pick the phenomenologically favored patterns of @xmath1 in the lma case .",
    "nine of the fifteen two - zero textures of @xmath1 listed in table 1 are found to be in accord with the lma solution as well as the atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "they can be classified into four categories : a ( with @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) , b ( with @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) , c and d ( with @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) .",
    "the point of this classification is that the textures of @xmath1 in each category result in similar physical consequences , which are almost indistinguishable in practice .",
    "the other six patterns of @xmath1 ( categories e and f ) listed in table 2 can not coincide with current experimental data .",
    "in particular , the exact neutrino mass degeneracy ( @xmath91 ) is predicted from three textures of @xmath1 belonging to category f.    now let us focus on patterns @xmath83 , @xmath85 , @xmath92 and @xmath89 as four typical examples for numerical illustration . our results for @xmath93 versus @xmath36 and @xmath80 versus @xmath79 are shown figs . 1  4 .",
    "some comments are in order .",
    "\\(1 ) for pattern @xmath83 , arbitrary values of @xmath36 are allowed if @xmath93 is large enough ( @xmath94 ) . the mixing angles @xmath79 and @xmath80 may take any values in the ranges allowed by current data",
    "therefore we conclude that pattern @xmath83 is favored in phenomenology with little fine - tuning .",
    "a similar conclusion can be drawn for pattern @xmath84 .",
    "\\(2 ) for pattern @xmath85 , @xmath36 is essentially unconstrained if @xmath93 is extremely close to zero ; and only @xmath36 around @xmath95 or @xmath96 is acceptable if @xmath93 deviates somehow from zero . except @xmath97 , there is no further constraint on the parameter space of @xmath98 .",
    "we conclude that pattern @xmath85 with maximal @xmath2 violation ( i.e. , @xmath99 ) is phenomenologically favored .",
    "so are patterns @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "\\(3 ) for pattern @xmath92 , @xmath100 or @xmath101 is forbidden .",
    "furthermore , @xmath102 is forbidden .",
    "we see that the allowed parameter space of @xmath103 and that of @xmath98 are rather large .",
    "hence pattern c is also favored in phenomenology .",
    "\\(4 ) for pattern @xmath89 , @xmath36 is restricted to be around @xmath75 or @xmath76 .",
    "in particular , the region @xmath104 is entirely excluded .",
    "@xmath105 holds for the allowed range of @xmath36 .",
    "different from patterns @xmath83 , @xmath85 and @xmath92 , pattern @xmath89 requires relatively strong correlation between @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( e.g. , small values of @xmath80 are associated with large values of @xmath79 in the allowed parameter space ) . in this sense",
    ", we argue that pattern @xmath89 is less natural in phenomenology , although it has not been ruled out by current experimental data . a similar argument",
    "can be made for pattern @xmath90 .",
    "it is worth remarking that patterns @xmath89 and @xmath90 were not included into the phenomenologically allowed patterns of @xmath1 in the previous classification @xcite , where only analytical approximations were made .",
    "our numerical analysis shows that these two patterns are marginally allowed by current data .",
    "here we have also explored some interesting details of the parameter space for every favorable texture , which could not be seen from simple analytical approximations .",
    "a two - zero texture of @xmath1 has a number of interesting predictions , in particular , for the absolute neutrino masses and the majorana phases of @xmath2 violation @xcite . with the help of eq .",
    "( 14 ) , one may calculate the mass ratios @xmath106 and @xmath107 as well as the majorana phases @xmath34 and @xmath35 . the absolute neutrino mass @xmath108 can be determined from @xmath109 therefore a full determination of the mass spectrum of three neutrinos is actually possible .",
    "then we may obtain definite predictions for the effective mass of the tritium beta decay , @xmath110 and that of the neutrinoless double beta decay , @xmath111 it is clear that the dirac phase @xmath36 has no contribution to @xmath22 .",
    "note that @xmath2- and @xmath112-violating asymmetries in normal neutrino oscillations are controlled by @xmath36 or the rephasing - invariant parameter @xmath113 .",
    "whether @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be measured remains an open question .",
    "the present experimental upper bounds are @xmath114 @xcite and @xmath115 @xcite at the @xmath45 confidence level .",
    "the proposed katrin experiment is possible to reach the sensitivity @xmath116 @xcite , and a number of next - generation experiments for the neutrinoless double beta decay @xcite is possible to probe @xmath22 at the level of 10 mev to 50 mev .",
    "we perform a numerical calculation of @xmath107 versus @xmath106 , @xmath35 versus @xmath34 , @xmath22 versus @xmath117 , and @xmath27 versus @xmath108 for patterns @xmath83 , @xmath85 , @xmath92 and @xmath89 . the results are shown in figs . 1  4 .",
    "some discussions are in order .",
    "\\(1 ) for pattern @xmath83 , @xmath118 or @xmath119 and @xmath120 hold in most cases .",
    "two neutrino mass ratios lie in the ranges @xmath121 and @xmath122 , and the absolute value of @xmath108 is in the range @xmath123 . as @xmath124 is a direct consequence of texture @xmath83 , we calculate the sum of three neutrino masses @xmath125 instead of @xmath22 .",
    "the result is @xmath126 , in contrast with @xmath127 .",
    "the rephasing invariant of @xmath2 violation @xmath27 is found to lie in the range @xmath128 .",
    "similar predictions are expected for pattern @xmath84 .",
    "\\(2 ) for pattern @xmath85 , @xmath129 or @xmath130 holds in most cases . two neutrino mass ratios @xmath106 may lie either in the range @xmath131 or in the range @xmath132 , and @xmath107 may lie either in the range @xmath133 or in the range @xmath134 .",

    ". two neutrino mass ratios @xmath106 may lie either in the range @xmath140 or in the range @xmath141 , and @xmath107 may lie either in the range @xmath142 or in the range @xmath143 .",
    "the value of @xmath108 is found to lie in the range @xmath144 .",
    "it is remarkable that @xmath145 holds to a good degree of accuracy in the allowed space of those input parameters .",
    "we also obtain @xmath146 and @xmath137 .",
    "\\(4 ) for pattern @xmath89 , @xmath147 or @xmath148 and @xmath149 hold .",

    "the range of @xmath27 is found to be @xmath155 .",
    "similar predictions can straightforwardly be made for pattern @xmath90 .",
    "we see that there is no hope to measure both @xmath21 and @xmath22 , if the neutrino mass matrix @xmath1 takes pattern @xmath83 or @xmath84 . as for categories b and c of @xmath1 , the upper limit of @xmath21 is close to the sensitivity of the katrin experiment ( @xmath156 @xcite ) , and that of @xmath22 is just below the current experimental bound @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have discussed some implications of the kamland measurment on the lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath0 and the neutrino mass matrix @xmath1 . the model - independent constraints on nine elements of @xmath0 have been obtained up to a reasonable degree of accuracy .",
    "nine two - zero textures of @xmath1 are found to be compatible with current experimental data , but two of them are only marginally allowed .",
    "instructive consequences of these phenomenologically favored textures of @xmath1 on the absolute neutrino masses , majorana phases of @xmath2 violation , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are numerically explored .",
    "our results will be very useful for model building @xcite , in order to understand why neutrino masses are so tiny and why two of the lepton flavor mixing angles are so large .",
    "finally it is worth remarking that a specific texture of lepton mass matrices may not be preserved to all orders or at any energy scales in the unspecified interactions from which lepton masses are generated",
    ". nevertheless , those phenomenologically favored textures at low energy scales , no matter whether they are of the two - zero form or other forms , are possible to provide enlightening hints at the underlying dynamics of lepton mass generation at high energy scales .",
