    "it has long been appreciated that time evolution in generally - covariant theories such as general relativity is , on the face of it , a gauge transformation and , contrary to everyday experience , should therefore be unobservable .",
    "reviews of this ` problem of time ' are given , for example , in @xcite , and textbook discussions may be found in @xcite . in recent years , detailed studies of quantized models of cosmology ( see , e.g. @xcite for reviews ) have demanded a practical solution to this problem , and a certain notion of ` internal time ' introduced by rovelli@xcite and further developed in , for example , @xcite has been quite widely adopted . the `",
    "evolving constant of the motion ' construction advocated in these papers is a particular implementation of the idea of relational time , according to which time evolution in covariant theories can be described only relative to the values assumed by some physical quantity that is chosen to serve as a clock . in simple cosmological models ,",
    "the clock is typically a scalar field , say @xmath0 , and in the quantum theory one obtains a wavefunction @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a variable describing the geometry of the model universe , as the solution of a schrdinger - like equation in which the parameter @xmath3 plays the role of time . in this paper , we take @xmath2 to be the volume of a spatially compact universe , in which case @xmath4 is interpreted as a probability density for the volume at the time when the scalar field @xmath0 takes the value @xmath3 .",
    "recently @xcite , we have argued that this interpretation is hard to sustain because , for the reasons summarized in section [ cjprobs ] below , the values assigned to @xmath3 can not be regarded as readings obtained by inspection of the ` clock ' @xmath0 . indeed , according to the usual rules of quantum mechanics ,",
    "the scalar field is not an observable at all , which is especially disconcerting if it constitutes the entire matter content of the universe . in view of this difficulty",
    ", we proposed a variant of the relational - time idea , which makes use of a small test clock , regarded as internal to some observer from whose point of view the universe is to be described . in this alternative construction ,",
    "the test clock is unobservable , and we obtain a wavefunction @xmath5 , evolving with a time parameter @xmath6 which is not a clock reading , but corresponds classically to the geometrical proper time that elapses along the observer s worldline .",
    "this new wavefunction yields a joint probability density , evolving in textbook fashion with proper time @xmath6 , for @xmath2 and @xmath0 , which are now genuine observable quantities .    in this paper , we first wish to investigate whether , despite the above - mentioned difficulties , the internal - time wavefunction @xmath1 can be interpreted as expressing a correlation between two quantities ( the volume and scalar field ) , both of which are observable in some suitably broadened sense .",
    "specifically , we ask whether @xmath4 can be regarded as a _ conditional _ probability density for the volume , given that the scalar field has been determined to have the value @xmath3 . to that end",
    ", we study a simple model of an homogeneous universe filled with pressureless matter , described , following brown and kucha@xcite , by a single scalar field .",
    "the classical version of this model is introduced in section [ classical ] , and we find that two complementary notions of internal time can be straightforwardly defined , using either the volume or the scalar field as a clock .",
    "these two internal times carry over to the quantized theory , as discussed in section [ quantum ] , and we use them in section [ internal ] to compute two corresponding probability densities .",
    "_ if _ the conditional - probability interpretation is feasible , then these ought to represent , on the one hand the conditional probability density for the volume given some value of the scalar field and , on the other hand , the conditional probability for the scalar field given some value of the volume .",
    "we find , however , that these probabilities are inconsistent .",
    "in fact , the two notions of internal time lead to two mutually contradictory views of time evolution : if the volume is used as internal time , the quantum theory appears to reproduce the classical big - bang singularity , whereas , if the scalar field is used as internal time , _ exactly the same quantum state _ appears to describe a universe in which the singularity is replaced by a bounce . this result serves to strengthen our conviction that the internal - time formalism , while resulting from perfectly sound mathematical manipulations , has no satisfactory physical interpretation .    in section [ testclock ] ,",
    "we augment the model by the addition of a test clock .",
    "as already indicated , the modified relational - time construction proposed in @xcite leads to a joint probability density for the volume and scalar field , both of which which are now _ bona fide _ observables , which evolves , according to a standard schrdinger equation , with proper time @xmath6 .",
    "like the usual time parameter in non - relativistic physics , @xmath6 is not itself observable . in principle",
    ", no set of experimental results records the evolution of an observed quantity relative to the time parameter that appears in newton s laws or in schrdinger s equation .",
    "rather , what is recorded is an observed correlation between the object of interest and the readings of some time - keeping device , and the rationale underlying the internal - time formalism is that taking this practical fact seriously is the key to solving the problem of time .",
    "consequently , it is of some interest to recover a ` timeless ' interpretation , by supposing that the observer to whom our unobserved test clock is internal also possesses a time - keeping instrument that _ is _ observed .",
    "this issue is taken up in section [ timeless ] .",
    "for the model at hand , though not in general , it turns out that the role of a time - keeping instrument can conveniently be assigned to the scalar field ( but not to the volume ) .",
    "when that is done , we obtain a genuine conditional probability density for the volume , which coincides , to a good approximation , with the function @xmath4 found from the internal - time formalism with @xmath3 as the internal time . in that indirect and approximate sense ,",
    "the brown - kucha scalar field emerges as a preferred internal time , indicating a bouncing universe .",
    "as described in detail by brown and kucha@xcite ( and in earlier work by brown@xcite ) , an effective hydrodynamic description of pressureless matter , or dust , is furnished by a collection of scalar fields @xmath7 @xmath8 , with a lagrangian density of the form @xmath9 where the 4-velocity field is @xmath10 .",
    "when the equations of motion are satisfied , the integral curves of @xmath11 can be interpreted as the worldlines of dust particles , and the scalar field @xmath0 is linear in the geometrical proper time @xmath12 that elapses along these worldlines .",
    "we consider the case of an homogeneous , spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker universe , with metric @xmath13 . to be concrete , we take spatial sections of this universe to be compact , with coordinate volume @xmath14 .",
    "homogeneity implies that spatial derivatives of @xmath0 and @xmath15 vanish , and variation with respect to @xmath16 leads also to @xmath17 . in this special case , therefore , the dust is modeled by a single scalar field @xmath0 , along with the lagrange multiplier @xmath18 : @xmath19,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is an arbitrary time coordinate .",
    "the momentum conjugate to @xmath0 is @xmath21 , and variation with respect to @xmath18 yields the second - class constraint @xmath22 .",
    "up to a sign , this constraint is trivially solved for @xmath18 , and we can construct the unconstrained dust hamiltonian @xmath23 evidently , @xmath24 is the total energy content of the dust , and we resolve the sign ambiguity by requiring this to be non - negative .    in the standard way , the einstein - hilbert action leads to a gravitational hamiltonian , which we write in terms of the volume @xmath25 and its conjugate momentum @xmath26 as @xmath27 @xmath28 being the usual gravitational constant .",
    "the function @xmath29 defined by this equation is the gravitational contribution to the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "taking the lapse function @xmath30 to be a strictly positive , but otherwise arbitrary function , we introduce the invariant proper time @xmath31 and express the hamilton equations of motion as @xmath32 where the overdot denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "the total hamiltonian here is @xmath33 ( distinguished by its subscript from the hamiltonian of an extended model to be considered later ) and the energy @xmath24 is a constant of the motion .",
    "finally , the hamiltonian constraint @xmath34 reproduces the friedmann equation .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ phieom])-([pveom ] ) are easily solved . denoting by @xmath35 , etc . the phase - space trajectory that passes through @xmath36 at @xmath37 , we have @xmath38 heuristically , given initial conditions that satisfy the constraint ( [ constraint0 ] )",
    ", these solutions provide a complete description of the evolution of this simple universe relative to the proper time @xmath12 that elapses along the worldline of a comoving observer .",
    "classically , this is possible because the equations of motion were derived _ before _ imposing the constraint . in a quantum - mechanical treatment",
    ", this time evolution can not be reproduced , because the hamiltonian @xmath39 that is supposed to generate it vanishes when acting on a physically allowed state .",
    "the same difficulty arises classically in a more formal treatment of the constrained hamiltonian dynamics . here",
    ", one has to recognize that , while the proper time defined in ( [ propertime ] ) is invariant under reparametrizations of the coordinate @xmath20 with @xmath40 ( the remnant , in this symmetry - reduced model , of the general coordinate invariance of general relativity ) , it is _ not _ invariant under an arbitrary change in the undetermined lapse function @xmath30 unless this is accompanied by a compensating reparametrization . from this perspective ,",
    "a change in @xmath30 , and hence evolution with respect to @xmath12 , is a gauge transformation generated by the constraint function @xmath41 .",
    "one has the option of fixing a gauge , by specifying once and for all a definite function @xmath30 .",
    "classically , at least , the content of ( [ phibar])-([pvbar ] ) is independent of the actual function chosen , and can be regarded as physically meaningful . but in a manifestly gauge - independent approach , which we follow here , genuine physical information is carried only by gauge - invariant ( dirac ) observables , which commute , in the sense of poisson brackets , with @xmath41 , and are therefore constants of the motion .    a construction due to rovelli@xcite allows us to obtain a 1-parameter family of gauge - invariant quantities ",
    "an ` evolving constant of the motion'as follows .",
    "denote by @xmath42 the time at which @xmath43 in ( [ phibar ] ) has the value @xmath3 . then the quantity @xmath44",
    "^ 2,\\ ] ] in which we suppress the dependence on the phase - space coordinates @xmath36 , can be interpreted classically as ` the volume at the time when the scalar field has the value @xmath3 ' .",
    "it is easy to check explicitly that @xmath45 for each value of the parameter @xmath3 .    a parameter such as @xmath3 is commonly referred to in the literature as a ` relational ' , ` emergent ' or ` internal ' time , or simply as ` time '",
    ", the idea being that the scalar field serves as a physical clock , and the function @xmath46 describes the evolution of the volume with respect to the readings of this clock . in the present case",
    ", this may seem especially apt , in view of the linear dependence ( [ phibar ] ) of the scalar field on @xmath12 . in @xcite , indeed , this idea is enshrined in the notation : these authors use @xmath47 for the scalar field that we denote by @xmath0 . for reasons that will become clear later , however ,",
    "we wish to maintain a clear distinction between the geometrical proper time defined by ( [ propertime ] ) and a scalar field @xmath0 whose equation of motion _ happens to have the solution _",
    "( [ phibar ] ) .",
    "we now wish to define a second family of dirac observables , taking the volume , rather than the scalar field , as an internal time .",
    "this entails solving ( [ vbar ] ) for the time @xmath48 at which the volume has the value @xmath49 , and requires a little care with regard to signs .",
    "first , we take the volume always to be positive , in contrast to the loop - quantum - gravity - inspired treatment described in @xcite , where the physical volume is the absolute value of a more fundamental variable , whose sign reflects the orientation of a co - triad .",
    "next , it follows from the equation of motion ( [ pveom ] ) that the evolution preserves the sign of @xmath50 , so the quantity @xmath51 that we provisionally identify as @xmath52 , is a constant of the motion .",
    "inspection of the solutions ( [ vbar ] ) and ( [ pvbar ] ) then reveals that trajectories on which @xmath50 is negative correspond to an expanding universe , starting from an initial singularity at @xmath53 , while those on which @xmath50 is positive correspond to a contracting universe and terminate at a final singularity at @xmath54 .",
    "consequently , we can take the square root of ( [ vbar ] ) , with @xmath55 , to obtain @xmath56 the sign of the square root being determined unambiguously by the requirement that @xmath49 is an increasing function of @xmath48 when @xmath50 is negative .",
    "thus , the dirac observable that represents ` the value of the scalar field when the volume is @xmath49 ' is @xmath57 again , one may check that @xmath58 for every value of @xmath49 .    finally , with a view to quantization",
    ", we define the dirac observables @xmath59 and we note that @xmath29 , defined in ( [ cgrav ] ) , is a constant of the motion , and hence also a dirac observable .",
    "we have the poisson - bracket relations @xmath60 and the evolving observables can be expressed as @xmath61 where we now identify @xmath62 the factor @xmath63 here , which follows from ( [ phinu ] ) appears inessential , but it will prove convenient to retain it .",
    "we now have two notions of evolution with respect to internal time , and it will be useful to identify the generators of these evolutions .",
    "indeed , we easily discover from ( [ poisson])-([phiofnu ] ) that @xmath64 with @xmath65 on any classical trajectory , @xmath66 is just the inverse of @xmath46 , but we shall see that this inverse relationship is not preserved in the quantum theory .",
    "we consider a quantization scheme of the wheeler - de witt type in which , in the first instance , the canonical coordinates @xmath67 are promoted to operators acting in an auxiliary ( or kinematical ) vector space .",
    "a convenient representation is that in which the operators @xmath68 and @xmath69 act by multiplication on wavefunctions @xmath70 , while their conjugate variables act by differentiation : @xmath71 the notation @xmath72 reflects the fact that @xmath69 corresponds to the energy content of the dust . as in @xcite",
    "we follow the authors of @xcite in choosing for the gravitational constraint the operator ordering @xmath73 then the hamiltonian constraint equation ( [ constraint0 ] ) reads @xmath74\\psi(v,\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{d}})=0,\\label{constraint1}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 with the definition @xmath76 the general solution to this equation can be expressed as @xmath77 where , in terms of the usual hankel functions , we write @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the classical phase space consists of two disjoint regions , distinguished by the discrete variable ( [ sigmaclass ] ) , containing expanding @xmath80 and contracting @xmath81 trajectories .",
    "( we ignore , for now , the hyperplane @xmath82 , on which the volume is constant , but see the comment following ( [ psiunder ] ) . )",
    "the corresponding operator is @xmath83 and we see from the integral representation @xmath84 that @xmath85 is a linear superposition of eigenfunctions of @xmath86 with positive eigenvalues , while @xmath87 is a superposition of eigenfunctions with negative eigenvalues .",
    "moreover , since @xmath88 , these two components of @xmath89 are orthogonal if , for example , we choose the inner product @xmath90 while we will not make direct use of this inner product , these consideration provide the heuristic motivation for our actual choice of the physical hilbert space @xmath91 .",
    "clearly , a solution of the constraint equation is specified by a pair of functions @xmath92 , and we take @xmath91 to be the direct sum of two copies of @xmath93 , with the inner product @xmath94.\\label{innprod}\\ ] ] then the operator @xmath95 , which is a constant of the motion , has a well - defined action in @xmath91 , namely @xmath96 with the exception of @xmath97 , defined in ( [ hnu ] ) , the observables we need to consider act independently in the two subspaces , and we will use the shorthand @xmath98 to represent an action of the form @xmath99    the operators @xmath68 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 defined in ( [ kinops ] ) do not have any well - defined action in @xmath91 ; that is , they do not act on a linear combination of @xmath85 and @xmath87 with @xmath102-independent coefficients to produce another such function .",
    "as one might expect , however , we can convert the classical dirac observables @xmath103 , @xmath104 and ( with slightly more difficulty ) @xmath105 given in ( [ diracv])-([diracphi ] ) into operators that do act in @xmath91 . for @xmath106 and @xmath107 we choose the operator orderings @xmath108 with @xmath109 given by ( [ cgravop ] ) .",
    "these three operators have the commutation relations @xmath110={\\mathrm{i}}\\hbar\\widehat{\\{a , b\\}}$ ] , with the poisson brackets shown in ( [ poisson ] ) , and it follows that the heisenberg equation of motion ( [ veom ] ) is promoted to @xmath111\\label{vhateom}\\\\\\ ] ] with @xmath112 and @xmath113 the operator version of ( [ vofphi ] ) . with the use of bessel s equation @xmath114 , it is straightforward to find the action of these operators in @xmath115 : @xmath116 with the inner product ( [ innprod ] ) , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are clearly symmetric , and @xmath117 , which acts by multiplication , is self - adjoint .",
    "construction of an operator @xmath118 corresponding to ( [ diracphi ] ) is not quite straightforward , because @xmath119 does not have a well - defined inverse .",
    "consider , however , a wavefunction @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is any bessel function of order 0 .",
    "we define an operator @xmath122 by writing @xmath123 where @xmath124 @xmath125 is a constant , and @xmath126 . by virtue of bessel s equation , we have @xmath127{\\mathrm{d}}z'\\\\ & = & z_0\\mathcal{c}_0'(z_0),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and this vanishes , provided that we choose @xmath125 to be a zero of @xmath128 , which is at a complex infinity in the case of the hankel functions . in this way",

    "consequently , the equation of motion ( [ phieom ] ) becomes the operator equation @xmath131,\\ ] ] where @xmath132 is self - adjoint , since it acts independently by multiplication in each subspace .",
    "we argued in @xcite that , while an operator such as @xmath113 is a perfectly good dirac observable , the internal time parameter @xmath3 can not bear the interpretation that one would like to place on it ( and which indeed is placed on it , in a significant part of the literature ) .    at the level of the classical equations of motion ( [ phieom])-([pveom ] ) and their solutions ( [ phibar])-([pvbar ] )",
    ", it seems quite feasible to say that @xmath46 is the volume ` when ' the scalar field has the value @xmath3 , provided that one does not enquire too closely about the instant of time ` when ' this pair of values is realized . but even classically , if one follows the systematic procedure of constructing a reduced , physical phase space , whose points are gauge orbits in the constraint manifold , one finds that this physical phase space is 2-dimensional .",
    "the corresponding configuration space is 1-dimensional : there do not exist two independent physical quantities which might simultaneously be determined to have the values @xmath3 and @xmath46 .",
    "quantum - mechanically , the configuration space on which states in @xmath91 are defined is again 1-dimensional .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 , which labels the family of dirac observables @xmath113 , _ can not _ be construed as a value obtained by observation of a physical clock ( the scalar field ) , because there is no operator acting in @xmath91 , independent of @xmath106 , to represent any such observable clock . in particular",
    ", the operator @xmath118 can not serve serve this purpose , for two related reasons .",
    "first , @xmath118 does not commute with @xmath113 for any value of @xmath3 , so the rules of quantum mechanics do not allow simultaneous measurements of the quantities represented by these two operators .",
    "second , the reason these operators do not commute is that they were constructed through the ` evolving constant of the motion ' algorithm , and are thus quite different from the kinematical operators @xmath68 and @xmath101 .",
    "classically , to interpret @xmath3 as a value of @xmath105 is to interpret @xmath46 as `` the volume at the time when the value @xmath3 is assumed by ` the scalar field at the time when the volume is zero ' '' .",
    "this is , of course , incoherent , and is made no less so by the transition to quantum mechanics .",
    "similar remarks apply , of course to the parameter @xmath49 that labels the family of observables @xmath133 : it _ can not _ be construed as the result of a measurement of the volume .",
    "given that these parameters can not be construed as values obtained from measurements , it is hard to see that they have any physical meaning at all .",
    "we now wish to strengthen this conclusion by considering the possibility that , notwithstanding the arguments just given , the internal - time formalism might be construed as yielding a joint probability distribution that represents a correlation between observable quantities , in this case the volume and the scalar field .",
    "that is to say , we will try to extend the notion of ` observables ' by dropping the requirement that they be represented by mutually commuting operators in @xmath91 .",
    "this is , in particular , a timeless interpretation , in which one might decide to ignore conundrums concerning the times at which specific values of the observables are realized .",
    "we will show , though , that in general no such probability distribution exists .",
    "the idea is this .",
    "if @xmath113 is regarded as the heisenberg - picture operator associated with evolution in an internal time @xmath3 , generated by the hamiltonian @xmath117 , then we can construct the corresponding schrdinger - picture wavefunction @xmath134 where @xmath135 is a suitable transform of @xmath136 on which @xmath106 ( that is , @xmath137 ) acts by multiplication : @xmath138 . according to the usual interpretation ,",
    "the object @xmath139 is the time - dependent probability density for obtaining the value @xmath140 from a measurement of the volume performed at ` time ' @xmath3 . in particular",
    ", this probability has the time - independent normalization @xmath141 . according to the foregoing discussion",
    ", the problem with this is that we have no idea what is meant by ` performing the measurement at time @xmath3 ' .",
    "the problem might be alleviated if we could reinterpret ( [ probnuatphi ] ) as a _ conditional _ probability density @xmath142 for the volume , given that some other quantity ( which we hope to identify with the scalar field ) has been determined to have the value @xmath3 , even though that other quantity does not appear explicitly in our formalism .",
    "an interpretation of that kind requires the existence of a _ joint _ probability density @xmath143 , with the normalization @xmath144 such that @xmath145 if this joint probability density does exist , we can use it to find the conditional probability density @xmath146 for the scalar field , given that the volume has been determined to have the value @xmath140 .    for the model under consideration",
    ", it happens that we already have such a probability density to hand , namely @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the wavefunction evolved in the internal - time parameter @xmath49 , and expressed in the representation where @xmath118 acts by multiplication : @xmath149 .",
    "more precisely , _ if _ the expression on the right of ( [ probnuatphi ] ) can be interpreted as a conditional probability , then it must be possible to interpret ( [ probphiatnu ] ) in the same way .",
    "up to this point , we have maintained a notational distinction between quantities that _ prima facie _ have quite different meanings , namely @xmath150 , which are internal - time parameters , and @xmath151 , which are configuration - space coordinates .",

    "in the light of the arguments summarized at the beginning of this section , one might expect the conditional probability interpretation to present some difficulty . let us , indeed , attempt to construct the required joint probability @xmath152 from the conditional probabilities @xmath153 and @xmath154 , which can be calculated once a wavefunction is specified",

    "( specifically , replacing @xmath213 with @xmath214 in ( [ psiunder ] ) leads to the mirror image of figure [ fig2 ] . ) from this perspective , the two sectors of the quantum theory reproduce the expanding and contracting regions of the classical phase space .",
    "a similar result is found in @xcite for a wheeler - de witt quantization of the model whose matter content is a massless scalar field , and more recently in @xcite , where the same model is treated in a consistent - histories approach .",
    "it is obvious from these figures that the two probability densities they depict can not arise as conditional probabilities from an underlying joint probability density .",
    "we emphasize that they are computed from _ exactly the same quantum state _ ; the difference arises solely from the two different notions of internal time used to construct the families of dirac observables @xmath113 and @xmath133 and their associated schrdinger - picture wavefunctions .",
    "it seems clear that these two notions of of internal time ` see ' the expanding and contracting sectors of the theory very differently , and that the difference is unlikely to be attributable to specific features of our chosen states .",
    "the probability densities shown in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] underline in a rather striking way ( which we did not anticipate at the outset of this investigation ) the difficulties of interpretation of the internal - time formalism discussed in section [ cjprobs ] .",
    "it seems to us that the two notions of internal time must stand or fall together , since they are merely two different implementations of the same algorithm .",
    "that is to say , since the two families of dirac observables are constructed in the same way , one can not consistently maintain that @xmath113 represents the volume when the scalar field has the value @xmath3 without accepting that , by the same token , @xmath133 must represent the scalar field when the volume is @xmath49 . since the two associated probability distributions , which arise in _ exactly the same quantum state _",
    "are seen to be in gross conflict , we conclude that both viewpoints can not simultaneously be correct , and therefore that neither of them is correct . as argued above",
    ", the underlying reason for this is that neither @xmath3 nor @xmath49 can be interpreted as a value assumed by any physically observable quantity .    some might wish to claim that the conflict should be resolved in favour of @xmath3 as a preferred internal time , because the model can be ` deparametrized ' in this variable : that is , the constraint ( [ constraint0 ] ) can be solved to obtain @xmath215 , where the function @xmath216 is independent of @xmath0 , and serves as the generator of evolution in the internal time @xmath3 .",
    "we do not think that this is a good argument in itself , but defer discussion of this point to section [ discussion ] .",
    "a pressing question raised by the above results is , of course , does the quantum theory resolve the classical singularity or not ? more generally , since in this example the answer seems to depend on an arbitrary choice of the variable that is to serve as internal time , do we have a reliable way of deciding whether or not the singularity is resolved in the context of _ any _ cosmological model and quantization scheme ?",
    "a possible answer is that quantum mechanics is actually ambivalent on this question .",
    "it could be , for example , that given some definite quantum state , different classes of observer will unavoidably disagree on whether that state involves a singularity or not .",
    "we proposed in @xcite , following earlier work in @xcite , a variant of the idea of relational time that seems to avoid the difficulties of interpretation we have stressed up to now , by introducing a ` test clock ' , which provides a preferred notion of time evolution _ from the point of view of a specific observer_. as described in the following section , this preferred description , from the point of view of a comoving observer internal to the model universe , effectively coincides with that furnished by @xmath3 as an internal time .",
    "as explained at greater length in @xcite , we supplement the model studied in previous sections with a rough - and - ready description of a small clock , which we consider to be _ internal _ to a specific observer , and thus localized on that observer s worldline . in a complete description ,",
    "the coordinate functions , say @xmath217 , that locate this worldline should appear as extra phase - space coordinates ( as should a complete set of metric and matter fields , @xmath218 and @xmath219 ) , but in the spirit of simplified cosmological models of the sort considered here , we assume that these degrees of freedom can be neglected",
    ". if the observer is comoving , then the proper time along the worldline is the same @xmath12 as appears in ( [ propertime ] ) . from the set of variables @xmath220 that describe the internal workings of the clock",
    ", we suppose that a function @xmath221 can be constructed , which constitutes the reading of the clock .",
    "crucially , however , we take the view that this reading , being internal to the observer in question , is in principle inaccessible to that observer , and for that reason need not feature in the physical phase space that describes the universe from that observer s point of view .",
    "rather , it provides the context for observations of other physical quantities to be made .",
    "solution of the equations of motion for the variables @xmath222 yields the clock reading @xmath223 at the proper time @xmath12 .",
    "this reading need not be linear in @xmath12 , but , if the clock is fit for our purpose , there must be , classically , a unique function @xmath224 , such that @xmath225 .",
    "that is , @xmath224 is the proper time at which the clock reads @xmath189 .",
    "it is not hard to show that @xmath226 , where @xmath227 is the clock s hamiltonian . because the system described by @xmath228 is ( ideally ) localized on a single worldline , @xmath228 and @xmath229 are independent of the cosmological variables @xmath36 .",
    "the total hamiltonian constraint is @xmath230 and , as shown in @xcite , the quantity @xmath231 is , for each @xmath6 , a dirac observable , @xmath232 .",
    "so , of course , are @xmath233 , etc . , defined in the same way .",
    "thus , we obtain a new set of evolving constants of the motion , which can be interpreted classically as the volume , etc .",
    ", when a proper time @xmath6 has elapsed along the observer s worldline since the clock read @xmath189 .",
    "the second crucial feature of this construction is that @xmath6 is _ not _ to be interpreted as a reading obtained from observation of a physical clock . from the point of view of the dynamical system governed by the constraint ( [ totalconstraint ] ) , it is an external , ` heraclitian ' time , in the sense of unruh and wald@xcite .",
    "we quantize this enlarged model using essentially the same scheme as in section [ quantum ] , adopting a kinematical representation in which @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath234 act by multiplication on wavefunctions @xmath235 , where @xmath236 is the energy of the clock .",
    "the kinematical operator representing the fiducial proper time @xmath229 is then @xmath237 .",
    "since we are no longer using the notion of evolution in the internal - time parameter @xmath49 , no operator of interest distinguishes the two sectors @xmath238 , and we will focus on a single sector , writing a solution to the constraint equation as @xmath239 where @xmath240 is the total energy , and @xmath121 is any bessel function of order 0 .",
    "the physical hilbert space is now @xmath241 , with the inner product @xmath242 the intention is that @xmath236 should be small compared with @xmath72 in the same sense that the biological system responsible for an astronomer s ciracdian rhythm , say , is small compared with the energy content of the visible universe , and we implement this by restricting attention to _ states _ such that @xmath243 is very small unless @xmath244 . the resulting limitations on the resolution with which @xmath6-dependent observables might be determined are examined in some detail in @xcite for a universe whose matter content is a massless scalar field , and we will not repeat the analysis for the present model .    acting in @xmath91 ,",
    "we find families of dirac observables @xmath245 where , acting on @xmath246 , @xmath247 note , in particular , that in ( [ newphihat ] ) , the derivative is with respect to @xmath72 keeping the total energy @xmath248 fixed .",
    "treating @xmath72 and @xmath236 as independent variables , we have @xmath249 .",
    "consequently , the observables @xmath250 and @xmath251 now commute for every @xmath6 and , according to the usual rules of quantum mechanics , can simultaneously be assigned measured values @xmath252 and @xmath253 . a domain on which all of these operators are symmetric",
    "is provided by the boundary conditions @xmath254 of course , @xmath255 means that the clock energy @xmath236 vanishes , and we always take @xmath246 to vanish fast enough at large arguments to ensure square integrability .",

    "thus , we can now define a _",
    "bona fide _ joint probability density , which evolves in the usual way with proper time @xmath6 , namely @xmath257 where @xmath258 in particular , this probability density has the @xmath6-independent normalization @xmath259 .    to make contact with the probabilities discussed in section [ internal ] , consider a state that factorizes as @xmath260 where @xmath261 is a wavefunction for the clock and , as above",

    ", it is an excellent approximation to extend the upper limit of the @xmath236 integral to infinity , in which case the wavefunction ( [ psinuphitau2 ] ) and the probability density ( [ tcprob ] ) also factorize .",
    "in fact , we have @xmath268 where @xmath269 coincides with the probability density defined in ( [ probnuatphi ] ) , except that we do not now need to distinguish the sectors @xmath270 . here , however , the arguments @xmath252 and @xmath271 genuinely stand for values obtained from observation of the quantities represented by the commuting operators @xmath106 and @xmath118 , and @xmath269 is a genuine conditional probability . the function @xmath272 is just the probability density for obtaining the value @xmath271 from a measurement of the scalar field at proper time @xmath6",
    "given a suitable choice of @xmath273 , it will be sharply peaked on a trajectory of the form @xmath274 , consistent with the solution ( [ phihatoftau ] ) of the heisenberg equation of motion .      we have emphasized that the parameter @xmath6 , which labels the families of dirac observables @xmath250 and @xmath251 is an unobservable , external time parameter .",
    "classically , it coincides with the arc length of an observer s worldline , on which the fiducial event , that the unobserved clock reads 0 , serves to define an origin .",
    "naturally , the time - dependent observations recorded by an astronomer who wishes to test a theoretical expression such as ( [ tcprob ] ) will not refer either to @xmath6 or to the internal , unobserved clock that we have pictured , for the sake of argument , as a biological clock .",
    "instead , they will refer to the observed readings of some time - keeping device , which we will call ( taking a cautious view of the generosity of the relevant funding agency ) a ` wristwatch ' .    from an operational point of view ( more or less in the sense of bridgman@xcite ) substantive physics",
    "is contained only in correlations between measured values of observable quantities . the idea that a solution to the problem of time in constrained systems is to be sought in such correlations is explicitly developed in , for example , @xcite , and is implicit in much of the recent literature .",
    "we have argued that the required correlations are _ not _ directly provided by a wavefunction such as ( [ psiover ] ) , but in the model considered here , it is straightforward to see that this wavefunction does indirectly lead to to an estimate of the desired correlation , to an approximation that might be extremely good . in principle , we would like to study correlations between observed values of the volume , the scalar field and the astronomer s wristwatch .",
    "since the wristwatch is another small clock , which classically follows , for practical purposes , the same worldline as the unobserved test clock , we could incorporate it into our model by adding its energy @xmath275 to the total constraint : @xmath276 this presents no technical difficulty , but since , for this particular model , @xmath24 and @xmath275 appear in the same way in @xmath277 , it is clear that we can usefully economize on clocks by deleting @xmath275 and treating the scalar field as the astronomer s timekeeping device .",
    "( here , we profit from the enormous simplification that results from the assumption of homogeneity . in a more general setting",
    ", we envisage that dirac observables depending on @xmath6 can be constructed only from fields in the observer s immediate locality . technical difficulties",
    "aside , this is no significant limitation , since the local fields include , for example , the cmbr photons entering the astronomer s telescope . )",
    "suppose , then , that simultaneous measurements of volume and scalar field are performed at a sequence of proper times @xmath278 , distributed according to some density function @xmath279 , with @xmath280 .",
    "( @xmath279 may have support only in a subinterval of @xmath281 if , for example , the observer s worldline terminates at a singularity . )",
    "the function @xmath282 is a correctly normalized joint probability density , which furnishes a timeless description of the correlation between these measured quantities . in the approximation that the joint probability density factorizes as in ( [ factorized ] )",
    ", we find @xmath283 where @xmath284 is the probability for finding the measurement of the scalar field on a randomly selected occasion to have yielded the value @xmath3 .",
    "for the state studied in section [ singres ] , @xmath269 is precisely the function depicted in figure [ fig1 ] , but the introduction of an unobserved test clock now allows us to interpret this function as a _",
    "bona fide _ conditional probability . in that indirect and approximate sense",
    ", we identify @xmath3 as a preferred internal time , and conclude that the singularity _ is _ resolved in this quantum theory  or at least that the observer whose unobserved clock is represented by @xmath228 will discover herself to be living in a bouncing universe .    in part , this conclusion is specific to our somewhat artificial model , in which the matter content of the universe is provided by the brown - kucha scalar field .",
    "more generally , consider a hamiltonian constraint of the form @xmath285 in this expression , @xmath286 is the contribution of metric and matter fields , @xmath228 is the hamiltonian of an unobserved test clock , and @xmath287 is the momentum conjugate to the pointer reading @xmath288 of a wristwatch following essentially the same worldline as the test clock . by taking the hamiltonian of the wristwatch to be just @xmath287 , we model a time - keeping device that is manufactured so as to supply a linear measure of the proper time along its worldline .",
    "following the same steps as before , we expect to obtain a physical hilbert space of functions @xmath289 , where @xmath290 is the total energy of the wristwatch and the unobserved clock , while @xmath291 collectively denotes the remaining metric and matter variables .",
    "operators on @xmath91 representing dirac observables include @xmath292 as in ( [ newchat ] ) and ( [ newphihat ] ) . taking a wave function that factorizes as @xmath293",
    ", we will obtain a schrdinger - picture wavefunction analogous to ( [ psinuphitau2 ] ) , of the form @xmath294 from this , we obtain a joint probability @xmath295 and , if we wish , the timeless version @xmath296 , which describe correlations between observed values of the cosmological quantities @xmath291 and the wristwatch pointer @xmath288 .",
    "however , because the energy @xmath290 is now the total energy of two small clocks , the wide separation of energy scales which led to the factorization in ( [ factorized ] ) is no longer present , and the cosmological field @xmath3 is replaced by the wristwatch pointer @xmath288 .",
    "generically , therefore , we do _ not _ automatically recover a conditional - probability interpretation of any internal time chosen from among the cosmological variables @xmath291 .",
    "we argued in @xcite that the notion of internal time , especially as commonly implemented in models of quantum cosmology , is unsatisfactory , for two reasons .",
    "first , it offers no account of the passage of time as it is ordinarily conceived .",
    "ordinarily , there seems to be a clear sense in which a well - constructed clock reads ` 10s ' seven seconds after it read ` 3s ' , and this does not appear merely to result from a conspiracy amongst the manufacturers of time - pieces .",
    "that is , a time - keeping device can be said to work accurately ( or not ) , because there is a time to be kept , not merely because its readings tend to agree ( or not ) with those of other devices of the same sort . in general relativity , this notion of time is provided , for some specific observer , by the proper time that elapses along that observer s worldline , but it is not recovered in a treatment that describes evolution by correlating , for example , the volume of a spatial region with the value of a scalar field .",
    "second , as summarized in section [ cjprobs ] , the meaning of a parameter that serves as an ` internal time ' is unclear ; in particular , it can not be construed as a value obtained from the observation of any physical quantity that is to be regarded as a clock , because no such quantity is represented by any operator acting in the physical hilbert space @xmath91 .",
    "the textbook interpretations of quantum mechanics are not , of course , designed to deal with dynamics generated by a hamiltonian constraint , and some modification might well be needed to deal with that situation . in particular , one should perhaps reconsider the usual statements that observable quantities are represented by symmetric operators on @xmath91 , and that the values of two such observables can be determined simultaneously only if their corresponding operators commute . concretely , for models of the kind considered here , it is certainly possible to compute a wavefunction @xmath297 , which ostensibly evolves with respect to internal time @xmath3 , and one would like to be able to interpret it as expressing a correlation between observed values of the volume _ and _ the scalar field . in view of the @xmath3-independent normalization @xmath298 , the quantity @xmath299",
    "can not be interpreted as a _ joint _ probability density , but it might be possible to regard it as a _ conditional _ probability density for the volume , _ given _ that the scalar field has the value @xmath3 .",
    "if so , then ( i ) there must be some underlying joint probability density , not directly supplied by the usual interpretation of the wavefunction , and ( ii ) there must exist a complementary conditional probability density for the scalar field , given some value for the volume .    to investigate this possibility ,",
    "we have studied a simple model and quantization scheme , whose main virtue is that it admits the explicit construction _ within the same quantization scheme _ of two complementary internal - time evolutions .",
    "we found , though , that the two complementary probability distributions , _ computed for the same quantum state _ are inconsistent .",
    "in fact , these two notions of internal time lead to qualitatively different physical interpretations of the same quantum state : with the scalar field as internal time , the universe appears to bounce ( figure [ fig1 ] ) , whereas with the volume as internal time it appears to expand from an initial singularity ( figure [ fig2 ] ) . in view of this inconsistency , we conclude that neither of these two notions of internal time can be correct .",
    "if the operator @xmath113 really represents the volume when the scalar field is @xmath3 , then it must also be true that @xmath133 is the scalar field when the volume is @xmath49 , and that can not be so .",
    "we now wish to conclude further that the notion of internal time , as implemented by the evolving constant of the motion construction , is not tenable in general . to be sure ,",
    "we have discovered a serious inconsistency only in the context of one particular model and one particular quantization scheme for which the required computations are straightforward , but if the idea were sound in general , then it ought to apply to this example .",
    "as described in section [ testclock ] , a variant of the relational - time construction proposed in @xcite is capable of circumventing these difficulties .",
    "we augmented the model by including an idealized description of a small test clock , which we imagine to be internal to a specific observer , in this case a co - moving observer .",
    "the time parameter @xmath6 that labels families of dirac observables is , classically , at least , the proper time that elapses along the observer s worldline .",
    "its value is not to be regarded as obtained from observation of any physical clock and , from the point of view of the observer in question , plays the same role as the _ external _ time in textbook newtonian or quantum mechanics .",
    "the test clock itself we take to be unobservable in principle by the observer in question , by virtue of being internal to that observer . using this construction",
    ", we could obtain _ bona fide _ joint probabilities , which describe genuine correlations between cosmological observables and whatever time - keeping the observer might use in the course of recording observations .    in the case that the observer uses the cosmological scalar field as a ( large ) clock , the resulting conditional probability density for the volume essentially coincides with the evolving probability density obtained using the scalar field as an internal time .",
    "this is a special feature of the brown - kucha field , whose contribution to the hamiltonian constraint ( [ constraint0 ] ) is just its canonical momentum . for the same reason , this model is deparametrizable in the variable @xmath0 : in effect , by substituting @xmath300 , one converts the constraint equation into a schrdinger - like equation that governs evolution in the internal time @xmath3 .",
    "we do not think , however , that deparametrizability is in itself sufficient to identify a preferred internal time , though it does , of course , make the implementation straightforward .",
    "in general , a model is deparametrizable in a variable @xmath0 if the constraint @xmath301 can be solved to obtain @xmath302 , where @xmath216 is independent of @xmath0 , and @xmath303 denotes the remaining canonical variables .",
    "again , one can substitute @xmath300 to obtain a schrdinger - like equation , but , again , the parameter @xmath3 can not be interpreted as the observed value of some physical quantity , and it is hard to see what other meaning it might have .",
    "moreover , this strategy suffers from what kucha@xcite calls the ` hilbert space problem ' .",
    "that is , the schrdinger - like evolution can be implemented only if the inner product on @xmath91 is chosen so as to make @xmath304 self - adjoint .",
    "the same inner product will not necessarily confer self - adjointness on the generators of evolution with respect to other candidates for an internal time , and it seems somewhat unreasonable that the inner product , and hence the quantum theory as a whole , should depend on this arbitrary choice of an internal time . in the present example , @xmath0 has a preferred status not because of deparametrizability as such , but rather because its contribution to the constraint is linear in @xmath24 with a constant coefficient .",
    "in fact , it is worth noting that the canonical transformation @xmath305 and @xmath306 brings the constraint ( [ constraint0 ] ) to the form @xmath307 , so that this model is also deparametrizable in the variable @xmath308 .",
    "( some authors contrast a ` relativistic ' deparametrization in @xmath308 , meaning that @xmath41 is quadratic in @xmath309 , with a ` non - relativistic ' deparametrization in @xmath0 , meaning that @xmath41 is linear in @xmath24 . )",
    "this simple form of @xmath41 , depending only on momenta , explains why it is straightforward , in this model , to obtain the two notions of evolution with respect to internal time ( [ veom])-([hnu ] ) , with generators that can simultaneously be made self - adjoint in the quantum theory .",
    "we believe that the idea of a test clock , internal to some specific observer , as implemented here provides an improved notion of time evolution , but it would be at best premature to suggest that it yields a definitive solution to the problem of time in general . among the limitations of the proposal",
    "as we have so far described it are the following .",
    "( 1 ) while the construction appears to be successful in spatially homogeneous models with a single constraint , it does not follow that a similar construction will work in more general spacetimes .",
    "( 2 ) in particular , we have bypassed any explicit description of the observer s worldline by considering only a comoving observer in a friedmann - robertson - walker universe .",
    "( 3 ) the time parameter @xmath6 survives the passage to quantum mechanics as a @xmath310-number parameter , but it is not obvious that this parameter can be unambiguously described in the quantum theory as the arc length of a worldline . ( 4 ) in the context of simple cosmological models , at least , it seems to be an inevitable consequence of the constraint that some object to which one is inclined to attribute a real physical existence turns out to be unobservable .",
    "we think it is plausible that a clock which is internal to some observer should turn out to be unobservable in a description of the universe ` from that observer s point of view ' .",
    "however , this plausible form of words is not directly mandated by the formalism , and some other way of understanding the unobservability of whatever quantity is eliminated by solution of the constraint may turn out to be better founded .",
    "we plan to address these issues in future work .",

    "<S> this construction permits the derivation of consistent joint probability densities for observable quantities , which can be viewed either as evolving with proper time or as describing correlations in a timeless manner . </S>",
    "<S> section [ intro ] reveals whether the singularity is resolved or not . </S>"
