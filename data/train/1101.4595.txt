    "+ in addition to the quantitative differences shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , there is a qualitative difference between the as grown , cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 single crystals from feas solution and the single crystals grown from sn . whereas the sn - grown single crystals are malleable and can easily be bent and deformed , the crystals quenched from a 960@xmath1 c feas solution are brittle and tend to shatter if bending is attempted .",

    "+ given the dramatic difference in transition temperature , as well as the different signatures of the transition in resistivity and magnetization , several questions arise . among them",
    "we consider : ( i ) what is the nature of the phase transition in the as grown sample and ( ii ) can the transition in annealed samples be varied from near 170 k to below 100 k in a systematic manner ?",
    "we will address the latter question first and return to the former after the creation of a transition temperature ( @xmath8 ) - annealing temperature ( @xmath9 ) phase diagram .",
    "+ in order to assess the extent to which the 170 k phase transition that occurs in sn - grown , as well as annealed feas - grown , samples of cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 can be systematically shifted down to below 100 k we measured the temperature dependent susceptibility and resistivity of as grown samples that were annealed for 24 hours at temperatures ranging from 250 to 850@xmath1 c. figure [ f2 ] presents magnetic susceptibility and resistivity data for representative annealing temperatures . the decrease in susceptibility ( or increase in resistivity )",
    "can be shifted down in temperature by choosing an appropriate annealing temperature between 400 and 800@xmath1 c. for annealing between these temperatures the transitions , particularly as seen in the resistivity data , remain quite sharp and shift in a systematic manner . whereas the size of the jump in the magnetization remains fairly constant in the samples annealed in this temperature region , there is a monotonic increase in the magnitude of the increase in the resistivity ( see fig .",
    "[ f7 ] below ) .",
    "+ such a clear temperature dependence of the effects of annealing , over such a wide temperature range , begs the question of what the annealing time dependence of these effects is . in other cases of clear annealing effects ,",
    "both time and temperature cuts through phase space are needed to establish unambiguous annealing protocols.@xcite in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] we show the evolution of the magnetic susceptibility for different annealing times . at 450@xmath1 c ,",
    "0.5 hr is insufficient time to effect any significant change ; 1.0 hr leads to split , broadened features with drops in susceptibility below both 170 and 100 k ; 3.0 hr leads to a single , sharp feature near 170 k , comparable to what is seen for 24 hour anneals .",
    "this progression shows that for 450@xmath1 c , 24 hours is longer than the salient time scale for annealing .",
    "as would be expected , for higher temperatures the salient time scale is even shorter . in fig . [",
    "f3](b ) samples from a batch that had been annealed for a week at 500@xmath1 c , with a transition temperature above 150 k , were annealed at 800@xmath1 c for representative times . as can be seen",
    ", even a 0.5 hour anneal causes the sample to behave in a manner similar to the as grown ( quenched from 960@xmath1 c ) samples .",
    "+ figure [ f2 ] also demonstrates that 24 hour anneals at temperatures of 300@xmath1 c or lower temperatures do not change the temperature dependence of the as grown samples .",
    "the data from the sample annealed at 350@xmath1 c for 24 hours shows somewhat broadened drops in susceptibility near both 170 and 100 k , similar to what was seen for a 1.0 hr anneal at 450@xmath1 c ( fig .",

    "the one other data point we can add to this is the fact that 20@xmath1 c ( room temperature ) anneals approaching @xmath44 hours have not led to significant changes in behavior of as grown samples .",
    "+ a 24 hour anneal at 850@xmath1 c does not significantly change the transition temperature from that measured for the as grown samples quenched from 960@xmath1 c ( perhaps not too surprisingly since 850@xmath1 c is approaching the 960@xmath1 c quench temperature ) ; the resistivity data for this sample , though , can be collected below the transition temperature , showing that the low temperature state has a lower resistivity , leading to a downward jump in resistivity when cooling through the transition temperature .",
    "+ in order to see if similar changes in transition temperature could be induced by annealing samples that started with transitions near 170 k ( i.e. started with transitions similar to those found in sn grown cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 ) we annealed an entire batch of crystals at 400@xmath1 c for a week . the resistivity and susceptibility data for these samples are also shown in fig .",

    "figure [ f5 ] illustrates that , ( i ) there is some scatter in @xmath8 for a given @xmath9 , but ( ii ) that there is also a fairly well defined suppression of @xmath8 with increasing @xmath9 , e.g. a 400@xmath1 c anneal gives a very different transition temperature from a 700@xmath1 c anneal , which is itself different from a 850@xmath1 c anneal or the as grown sample . in addition , annealing at a given @xmath9 leads to a @xmath8 value , regardless of whether the sample starts from a 170 k or @xmath47 k transition state , i.e. this final anneal determines @xmath8 regardless of sample history .",
    "+ the @xmath11 phase diagram presented in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] shows that cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 grown out of feas can have the temperature of its phase transition modified in an essentially continuous manner from near 170 k to below 100 k. for transitions with @xmath8 between 170 k and 100 k the magnetic signature of the transition is essentially unchanged and the resistive signature evolves gradually with the jump in resistivity , @xmath48 , becoming larger as @xmath8 decreases . for the lowest @xmath8 values , below 100 k",
    ", there is a significantly larger drop in susceptibility and , when it can be measured , the jump in resistivity is downward on cooling rather than upward .",

    "[ f5 ] ) as well as the evolution of the resistive and magnetic signature of the phase transition ( figs .",
    "[ f1 ] - [ f4 ] ) make it plausible that for 170 k @xmath49 k the transition is similar to that seen in sn - grown cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 : a transition from a high temperature tetragonal , paramagnetic state to a lower temperature orthorhombic , antiferromagnetic state . on the other hand , dramatic changes in the resistive and magnetic signature associated with the as grown sample as well as samples annealed near",
    "850@xmath1 c are consistent with our current understanding of the collapsed tetragonal phase , a phase that up until this time was associated with cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 under pressures of 0.35 gpa or higher .",
    "the change in the resistive signature of the transition from a sharp increase to a sharp decrease , as well as the sudden increase in the size of the drop in susceptibility upon cooling are very similar to the changes seen in ref .",
    "under hydrostatic pressure applied with helium . for that matter ,",
    "the basic phase diagram proposed in refs is remarkably similar to the @xmath46@xmath1 c part of the @xmath11 phase diagram presented in fig .",

    "although it is not possible to determine the ordering temperature of the hypothetical , second order phase transition of an antiferromagnetically ordered , orthorhombic phase transforming into a paramagnetic , orthorhombic phase directly , since in reality the sample undergoes a strong first order transition to the tetragonal phase on warming , we can make an estimate by fitting the observed temperature dependence of @xmath60 to a brillouin function as is shown in figure [ f10 ] .",
    "this procedure yields estimated ordering temperatures of 300(10 ) k for the sample annealed at 400@xmath1 c , and 230(10 ) k for the sample annealed at 700@xmath1 c , with the errors dominated by an uncertainty in the effective total angular momentum quantum number , @xmath61 , used in the fits .",
    "we note that whereas the absolute values of the nel temperatures did depend somewhat on @xmath61 , the difference between the values of @xmath62 for the two samples did not , and was consistently 70(3 ) k. the magnetic ordering in the sample with the lower structural transition temperature is definitely weaker , involving slightly smaller iron moments .",

    "eds also indicated that the precipitate phase does not contain ca .",
    "efforts to identify the precise chemistry and structure of this second phase are on - going but it should be noted that the basal plane dimensions of the cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 and the tetragonal asfe@xmath0 ( space group @xmath89 , # 129 ) are within 5 % and have very similar @xmath86 $ ] diffraction patterns . a gross estimate of the impurity phase area in less than 5 % of the total sample , giving a gross idea of how much extra fe and as is trapped in the sample when it is initially quenched from 960@xmath1 c. + the similarity in the orientation and lack of distinguishing features in the diffraction between the as grown samples and the samples that were annealed suggests that there is a similarity in chemistry / structure between the tweed strain fields and coarser precipitates in these two samples and the difference is simply one of length scale . an epitaxial relationship would lower the energy barrier for nucleation and allow a second phase to form more readily if thermodynamically stable .",
    "annealing at moderate temperatures but within a two - phase field , would promote growth of the second phase to reduce the excess energy due to interfaces ( i.e. , oswald ripening ) .",
    "the observations here are consistent with an increase in the width of formation of cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 with respect to excess as and fe at elevated temperatures which decreases monotonically with temperatures below 960@xmath1 c. + such a temperature - dependent solid solubility of excess fe and as leads to the following , plausible , scenario .",
    "when the feas flux grown crystal is first quenched , there is little time for the excess as and fe to come out of solution . in these single crystals ,",

    "energetically , it appears easiest to exsolve excess as and fe epitaxially along the @xmath87 planes .",
    "differences in their unit cell size as well as their coefficients of thermal expansion ( cte ) can lead to significant stresses at the interfaces between the cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 majority phase and the finely dispersed fe / as based second phase . if , as fig .",
    "[ f12]a would suggest , domains of cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , about 40 nm on a side , are surrounded by nearly coherent second phase resulting in a significant volume fraction of interfaces or regions strained by interfaces , then the magnitude of the stress would be dependent on the volume fraction of the cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 in these strained regions .",
    "+ if there is a temperature dependence of the solubility of the excess as and fe , then quenching from lower temperatures would result in a smaller fraction of finely dispersed second phase , the remaining excess as and fe being sequestered in larger precipitates whose insignificant surface to volume ratio would have little impact on the matrix ( as is the case in fig . [ f12]b ) .",
    "this smaller amount of finely dispersed precipitate would lead to a smaller average strain ( or pressure ) on the sample , leading to an effective correlation between @xmath12 and @xmath9 .",
    "since the initial quench of the large crystals from the flux essentially locks in the excess as and fe , the subsequent processing history determines the size and distribution of the second phase and thereby determines the amount of strain in the sample . +",
    "further exploration of this hypothesis requires confirmation of the second phase crystal structure and its chemistry and determination of the cte and bulk moduli of these two phases .",
    "in addition , returning to the initial motivations for this study : given that annealing of as grown samples seems to lead to small changes in the transition temperatures of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 based compounds @xcite and given that cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 is much more pressure / strain sensitive than bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , it is worth exploring the implications of our current findings . if we speculate that a similar width of formation exists in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( or for that matter srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 ) and that low temperature annealing can lead to similar effects as those we present here , then , based on the existing @xmath90 phase diagrams , @xcite an effective pressure of @xmath13 gpa on bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 or srfe@xmath0as@xmath0",

    "we have found a remarkably large response of the transition temperature of cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 single crystals grown out of excess feas to annealing / quenching temperature . whereas crystals that are annealed at 400@xmath1 c exhibit a first order phase transition from a high temperature tetragonal to a low temperature orthorhombic and antiferromagnetic state near 170 k ( similar to what has been found in the original sn grown single crystals @xcite ) , crystals that have been quenched from 960@xmath1 c exhibit a transition from a high temperature tetragonal phase to a low temperature , non - magnetic , collapsed tetragonal phase below 100 k. we have been able to demonstrate that the transition temperature can be reduced in a monotonic fashion by varying the annealing / quenching temperature from 400 to 850@xmath1 c with the low temperature state remaining antiferromagnetic for transition temperatures larger than 100 k and",
    "becoming collapsed tetragonal / non - magnetic for transition temperatures below 90 k. this suppression of the orthorhombic / antiferromagnetic phase transition and its ultimate replacement with the collapsed tetragonal / non - magnetic phase is similar to what has been observed for sn - grown single crystals of cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 under hydrostatic pressure .",
    "@xcite this similarity is summarized in fig .",

    "samples quenched from 960@xmath1 c have , finely divided , strain structure with characteristic length scales and spacings of less than 50 nm . on the other extreme ,",
    "samples annealed at 400@xmath1 c have clearly identifiable , ca free , crystalline inclusions with dimensions of @xmath91 nm@xmath92 that are separated by 500 to 1,000 nm . these images make it clear that when the sample is quenched from 960@xmath1 c it is possible to think of some average , near uniform strain throughout the sample associated with the overlapping strain fields of this fine precipitate . it is this strain that appears to be giving rise to the dramatic suppression of @xmath8 , in , apparently , a similar manner that hydrostatic pressures of @xmath13 gpa can .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that , as was the case with hydrostatic pressure applied by helium pressure medium , @xcite there is no indication of superconductivity , even in trace amounts .",

    "<S> we have found a remarkably large response of the transition temperature of cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 single crystals grown out of excess feas to annealing / quenching temperature . whereas crystals that are annealed at 400@xmath1 c exhibit a first order phase transition from a high temperature tetragonal to a low temperature orthorhombic and antiferromagnetic state near 170 k , crystals that have been quenched from 960@xmath1 c exhibit a transition from a high temperature tetragonal phase to a low temperature , non - magnetic , collapsed tetragonal phase below 100 k. by use of temperature dependent electrical resistivity , magnetic susceptibility , x - ray diffraction , mssbauer spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements we have been able to demonstrate that the transition temperature can be reduced in a monotonic fashion by varying the annealing / quenching temperature from 400 to 850@xmath1 c with the low temperature state remaining antiferromagnetic for transition temperatures larger than 100 k and becoming collapsed tetragonal / non - magnetic for transition temperatures below 90 k. this suppression of the orthorhombic / antiferromagnetic phase transition and its ultimate replacement with the collapsed tetragonal / non - magnetic phase is similar to what has been observed for cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 under hydrostatic pressure . </S>",
    "<S> transmission electron microscopy studies indicate that there is a temperature dependent , width of formation of cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 with a decreasing amount of excess fe and as being soluble in the single crystal at lower annealing temperatures . for samples quenched from 960@xmath1 c </S>",
    "<S> there is a fine ( of order 10 nm ) , semi - uniform distribution of precipitate that can be associated with an average strain field whereas for samples annealed at 400@xmath1 c the excess fe and as form mesoscopic grains that induce little strain throughout the cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 lattice . </S>"
