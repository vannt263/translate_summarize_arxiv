    "for a heavy hadron which contains a single heavy quark ( bottom or charm ) , the heavy quark mass @xmath4 is much larger than the qcd energy scale @xmath5 which characterizes the light degrees of freedom in the heavy hadron .",
    "the four momentum of the heavy quark can be expressed as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is taken to be the velocity of hadron at the rest frame , and @xmath8 is the residual momentum of the order of binding energy , which is much smaller than @xmath4 . the heavy quark symmetry @xcite and its breaking effects are of particular importance in studying such hadrons .",
    "consequently , the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) has been developed , where the effective lagrangian is expanded in @xmath9 . in deriving the lagrangian of hqet",
    ", the quark and antiquark are assumed to be conserved separately . namely the heavy antiquarks are regarded as completely decoupled from the heavy quarks at the beginning .",
    "the transition matrix elements can also be represented in series of @xmath9 through the heavy quark expansion ( hqe ) and evaluated order by order .",
    "hqet and hqe have been discussed by many authors @xcite . in the past two decades",
    "they are widely used in studying heavy hadrons .",
    "when the momentum of the heavy quark is much lower than the quark - antiquark pair creation threshold , an alternative framework of effective field theory for heavy quarks can directly be derived from the full qcd @xcite .",
    "just like for other effective theories , the basic idea is that some degrees of freedom characterizing higher scale physics can be decomposed and integrated out when we consider physics at low energy scales",
    ". concretely speaking , for heavy quarks with @xmath10 , one may perform a complete decomposition of the qcd full field into quark field and antiquark field via positive and negative energy components ( see below ) of a full field , and integrate out the small components of quark field and antiquark field , which leads to the so - called @xmath9 corrections .",
    "when considering heavy quark ( or antiquark ) systems , one should further integrate in the contributions of heavy antiquark ( or quark ) components . as a consequence ,",
    "additional @xmath9 corrections arise from the quark - antiquark coupling terms in the full qcd .",
    "it should be noted that such a framework is distinguishable from the usual hqet in which the particle and antiparticle were assumed to be conserved separately and treated in a different way . for convenience , we refer to such a framework as a heavy quark effective field theory ( hqeft ) . though the heavy quark - antiquark coupling effects vanish in the heavy quark limit , they are actually nonzero when one considers the finite mass contributions .",
    "it is then not surprising that the @xmath9 corrections evaluated in hqeft and hqet could be different though they are the same in the infinity mass limit .",
    "for instance , the transition matrix elements of @xmath9 corrections concern less independent wave functions in hqeft than in the usual hqet and the @xmath9 order corrections at zero recoil automatically vanish in hqeft , and there exist some relations between wave functions and heavy hadron masses in hqeft .",
    "hqeft has been applied to explore various processes of heavy hadrons .",
    "in particular , the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements @xmath3 and @xmath11 are extracted from both inclusive @xcite and exclusive @xcite b decays . in the treatment of inclusive",
    "b decays , the dressed heavy quark mass @xmath0 as a whole enters the formulation , which implies that a  dressed heavy quark \"- hadron duality is more reasonable than the naive heavy quark - hadron duality . as a consequence ,",
    "when the inclusive decay rates of heavy hadrons are expressed in terms of the physical hadron masses , they receive no @xmath2 order corrections .",
    "this treatment not only suppresses the next - to - leading order contributions and makes the operator product expansion ( ope ) reliable , but also diminishes the large uncertainties arising from the heavy quark mass . for exclusive decays",
    ", hqeft has also been demonstrated to be reliable . whereas in our previous works the heavy quark expansion for the effective lagrangian and transition matrix elements",
    "is carried out in powers of @xmath9 .    in this paper , we briefly review the description of hqeft and show that a @xmath2 expansion is also consistently applicable to the heavy quark effective lagrangian and transition matrix elements . in sec .",
    "[ sectionlagrangian ] , we first outline the derivation of a complete hqeft and then extend it to the formulation in terms of @xmath2 expansion . in sec .",
    "[ sectionmatixelement ] , we present new formulae for hqe of heavy - to - heavy transition matrix elements by applying the @xmath2 expansion . in sec .",
    "[ sectionvcb ] , we extract the ckm matrix element @xmath3 based on the new formulation and the most recent experimental data . our conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ sectionsummary ] .",
    "the lagrangian in the full qcd is @xmath12 @xmath13 is the full field for heavy quark , and @xmath14 represents the section containing no heavy quarks .",
    "based on the principle of superposition , the field @xmath13 in quantum field theory is actually the superposition of two parts which correspond to the positive and negative energy components .",
    "namely the full field @xmath13 can always be decomposed formally into positive and negative energy parts @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 may be expressed explicitly in the energy - momentum space as @xmath18 it is clear that @xmath16 and @xmath17 correspond to the positive and negative energy parts of the full field @xmath13 , which are the so - called quark field and antiquark field , respectively . in the case for free quark fields , they can be expanded in terms of plane waves as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the spin index , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the annihilation and creation operators respectively , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are four - component spinors . in dirac representation , they can be explicitly written as @xmath25 with @xmath26 being the two component pauli spinor field that annihilates a heavy quark , and @xmath27 being the pauli spinor field that creates a heavy antiquark . later on",
