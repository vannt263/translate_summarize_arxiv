    "in @xcite the claim is made that in the spacetime @xmath0 a  local \" experiment , involving the electrostatic field of a point - charge , can be used to determine whether or not an inertial observer is privileged .",

    "nearby \" measurements of the electrostatic field strength generated by a stationary point - charge in their frame .",
    "the results found in section 2 support the idea that this can be done , at least in principle . but rather the more immediate question of whether the experiment proposed by @xcite is truly local , even if it is done in only one frame .",
    "] however , we do not agree with the claim that this is a truly  local \" experiment .",
    "the principle of relativity , at least in general relativity , says that the _ local _ laws of physics do not distinguish between two inertial observers .",
    "hence , there is no _ local _ experiment that an observer can perform in order to determine whether or not she is privileged .",
    "therefore , the  local \" experiment proposed by @xcite can not be called ",
    "local \" if we wish to retain the principle of relativity .",
    "yet , a dogmatic commitment to the principle of relativity does nothing to explain why the experiment is not a local one . at a more basic level",
    ", one can argue as follows .",
    "we start by investigating the meaning of the word  local . \" in the present context one can distinguish between two notions of locality : * geometrical locality * and * topological locality * ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "we shall say that a physical system is local in the geometrical sense if it exists wholly within  an infinitesimal region \" of the spacetime manifold . on the other hand",
    ", we shall say that a physical system is local in the topological sense if it exists wholly within a region we call  a patch \" of the manifold . since an infinitesimal region ( whatever that is ) can be contained within a single patch of @xmath0 , it follows that the topological notion of locality generalizes the geometrical notion .",
    "thus , if a system is not local in the topological sense , it can not be local in the geometrical sense either .",
    "it is sufficient for our purposes to note that a properly local experiment necessarily involves only a physical system which can be completely described within one patch of the spacetime manifold .",
    "we can apply this notion to see why the experiment described in the introduction of this note , the experiment involving a light flash , is not local .",
    "this thought experiment concerns a physical system involving light signals which traverse the entire compact dimension of @xmath0 .",
    "hence , at least _ two _ patches of @xmath0 would be needed in order to completely describe the experiment . in a certain nave sense",
    ", this experiment only requires the observer to make a few local time measurements on his or her worldline ; whence we notice that even if an experiment wholly relies on measurements which navely appear to be  local , \" it does not follow that the whole experiment itself really _ is _ local .",
    "the same argument carries over to the  local \" thought experiment proposed by @xcite .",
    "their experiment only requires the observer to make apparently  local \" ( or  nearby \" ) measurements of an electrostatic field , but this does not mean that the experiment is truly local . indeed , a more _ complete _ description of the experiment would account for the underlying physical systems which influence each measurement .",
    "for example , consider the question : what produces the  local \" electrostatic field and what determines its structure ?",
    "the producer of the field is the point - charge source ( in the sense that , in this thought experiment , there is no field without the point - charge ) , and the structure of the field ( at any point where it is defined ) depends on  global \" topological features of the manifold ( a fact which is not overlooked in @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the experiment proposed by @xcite , if described more completely , actually involves a physical system which includes the point - charge source together with an electrostatic field generated by the charge , which wraps all the way around the compact dimension .",
    "this physical system can not be described within a single patch of the manifold .",
    "therefore , the experiment is not local .",
    "indeed , the principle of relativity _ must _ hold locally in @xmath0 .",
    "a local experiment is a physical system which can be completely contained in a single patch of @xmath0 .",
    "a patch of @xmath0 is essentially indistinguishable from a region of minkowski spacetime @xmath2 , in which the principle of relativity certainly holds .",
    "this argument is independent of the topology of @xmath0 .",
