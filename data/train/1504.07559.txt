    "it is a striking fact that , using known physics , one can account for the observed large scale structure of the universe starting from the tiny homogeneities in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) as seeds .",
    "the presence of these very specific seeds , in turn , can be successfully accounted for in the inflationary scenario , which refers to a much earlier epoch when matter density and curvature of the universe were over @xmath0 orders of magnitude higher than they were in the cmb era .",
    "this leap is impressive .",
    "furthermore , the underlying paradigm is conceptually attractive because it reduces the issue of genesis to _ vacuum fluctuations _ at the onset of inflation .",
    "although the curvature scale of inflation is so high compared to that of the cmb epoch , it is still significantly lower than the planck scale",
    ". therefore , it is safe to assume that space - time geometry is well - described by general relativity ( gr ) during and after inflation .",
    "this is a happy circumstance , allowing one to ignore what happened before .",
    "but from a deeper perspective , this is only a stopgap measure . for ,",
    "if one goes further back in time , we encounter the planck regime where quantum field theory ( qft ) in curved space - times used in standard inflation is no longer applicable @xcite .",
    "we need quantum gravity .",
    "now , there is a long - standing expectation that quantum gravity effects will resolve the big bang singularity of gr .",
    "this would require _ very large _ quantum corrections to the underlying geometry , resulting in a paradigm shift at the planck scale .",
    "one is therefore led to ask : will inflation arise naturally in this deeper theory ? or , more modestly , can one at least obtain a consistent quantum gravity extension of the inflationary scenario ?",
    "can one meaningfully specify initial conditions in the planck regime ? in a viable quantum gravity theory , this should be possible because there would be no singularity and the planck scale physics would be well - controlled .",
    "would the resulting systematic evolution from the planck epoch again lead to the correlation functions and the spectral index that are compatible with observations ? if not , that quantum gravity approach would be _ ruled out _ at least in the cosmological sector . if these cmb features are consistent with observations , are there new predictions for future missions which keep memory of the pre - inflationary dynamics ?",
    "if so , one would be able to directly confront that quantum gravity theory with observations .",
    "thus , attempts to overcome conceptual incompleteness of the inflationary scenario can provide novel ways to test and guide candidate quantum gravity theories .",
    "thanks to systematic investigations over the past decade , loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) is now sufficiently developed to address these issues . as is common in physics",
    ", a more fundamental analysis introduces a new scale at which novel phenomena can occur . in lqc ,",
    "as we discuss in section 2 , because of the underlying _ quantum _ geometry , the big bang singularity is resolved and replaced by a quantum bounce .",
    "the curvature at the bounce is universal and introduces a new length scale @xmath1 .",
    "the key new phenomenon is the following : pre - inflationary lqc dynamics modifies the standard inflationary predictions in a universal way for modes whose wavelength at the bounce is larger than @xmath1 .",
    "detailed analysis shows that these correspond either to the longest wavelength modes observable today and/or modes whose wavelength is larger than the radius of the observable universe but which can couple to the observable modes @xcite .",
    "therefore the pre - inflationary dynamics of lqc can have interesting ramifications for the @xmath2 anomalies in the planck data associated with the largest angular scales .    at first reading ,",
    "this assertion may seem counter - intuitive on two accounts .",
    "first , one generally expects quantum gravity effects to modify only the short - distance behavior .",
    "how could they have any implications to predictions for the longest wavelength modes ?",
    "second , it is often claimed that while quantum gravity effects may be conceptually interesting , they will not be relevant for cosmological observations because they will all be diluted away during inflation .",
    "we will now discuss why these expectations are _ not _ borne out .",
    ", width=604 ]    the belief that the pre - inflationary dynamics does not matter stems from the following argument ( see the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "if one evolves the modes that are seen in the cmb _ back _ in time using gr , their physical wavelengths @xmath3 continue to remain smaller than the curvature radius @xmath4 all the way to the big bang .",
    "the equations governing the evolution of these modes then imply that they propagate as though they were in flat space - time and can not get excited in the pre - inflationary stage .",
    "therefore , the argument goes , they will be in the bunch - davies ( bd ) vacuum at the onset of inflation .",
    "but in the pre - inflationary calculations , dynamical equations of gr can not be trusted in the planck regime ; we must use instead a candidate quantum gravity theory . in lqc , if a mode has @xmath5 at the bounce , it _ does _ experience curvature during pre - inflationary dynamics and can get excited ( see the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . for suitable choices of initial conditions at the bounce ,",
    "these modes correspond to the largest angular scales seen in the cmb , roughly to @xmath6 in the spherical harmonics decomposition of correlation functions .",
    "thus , the _ ultraviolet _ modifications of the _ background dynamics _ that cure the big bang singularity can directly influence the _ infrared _ behavior of _ perturbations . _ these longest wavelength modes , then , will not be in the bd vacuum at the onset of inflation @xcite . but why will this fact alter the observable predictions of inflation ?",
    "will not these excitations just get washed away during inflation ?",
    "the answer is in the negative because of the accompanying _ stimulated _ emission .",
    "agullo , navarro - salas and parker have shown that if one were to start with a candidate non - bd vacuum at the onset of inflation , the stimulated particle creation would result in certain departures from the standard predictions based on the bd vacuum @xcite .",
    "the pre - inflationary dynamics of lqc provides specific non - bd initial states at the onset of inflation , thereby streamlining the possibilities and leading to an interplay between the planck scale physics and observations .",
    "although loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) is still far from being complete , given a physical problem , one can carry out a truncation adapted to that problem , and then use the quantum geometry underlying lqg to construct a quantum theory of that sector .",

    "thus , singularities of general relativity especially the big bang are the gates for physics beyond einstein . since gravity is encoded in geometry in gr , it is natural to expect that a quantum theory of gravity will require or lead to an appropriate quantum generalization of riemannian geometry .",

    "( 4 ) _ evolve this state using qft on the dressed flrw metric @xmath58 and calculate the power spectrum and other correlation functions at the end of inflation . _",
    "( 5 ) _ check if the test field approximation holds throughout the ` quantum geometry regime ' . if not , one has to discard the solution .",
    "but if the approximation does hold , then @xmath47 would be a _ self - consistent solution _",
    ", representing an extension of standard inflation over the 11 orders of change in curvature that separate the onset of inflation from the planck scale .",
    "_ ( 6 ) _ finally , check the _",
    "physical _ viability of the solution and compare the predictions of power spectra and correlation functions with observations .",
    "the discussion of the next two sub - sections will show that , by now , lqc has matured sufficiently to complete all these steps .",
    "conceptually , the most non - trivial open issue is that of selecting initial conditions for the quantum state @xmath48 of cosmological perturbations . in standard inflation ,",
    "these are specified at the onset of the slow roll .",
    "now , during the slow roll , the background flrw geometry can be approximated by the de sitter metric and there is a unique regular state the bd vacuum that is invariant under the full de sitter group .",
    "therefore , the initial state is assumed to be the bd vacuum .",
    "by contrast , during pre - inflationary dynamics , the hubble parameter can change rapidly . to illustrate this difference ,",
    "let us consider a concrete example with @xmath66 ( used in the numerical simulations discussed below ) .",
    "the bounce is followed by a short superinflationary phase during which the hubble parameter increases from _ zero _ to its _ maximum _ in lqc , @xmath67 , in just 0.18 planck seconds .",
    "it then takes approximately @xmath68 plank seconds till the onset of slow roll inflation at which time the hubble parameter has decreased to @xmath69 .",
    "thus , while the duration between the bounce and the onset of inflation is about the same as that of the slow roll itself , the dressed effective metric @xmath58 does not _",
    "at all _ resemble the de sitter metric in this pre - inflationary phase ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore there is _ no _ reason to assume that the perturbations are in the bd vacuum during this phase .",
    "however , compatibility with observations requires that the state resulting from pre - inflationary evolution should be sufficiently close to the bd vacuum at the onset of inflation .",
    "a priori this is a heavy burden on pre - inflationary dynamics . but this requirement can be naturally met in lqc .",
    "while the quantum geometry @xmath14 does not have full de sitter symmetry , it is invariant under the six - dimensional euclidean group @xmath70 of space translations and rotations",
    ". therefore , it is natural to require that the state @xmath48 of perturbations is also _",
    "invariant under the @xmath70 symmetry_. next , to check that the test field approximation holds , we need to calculate the stress - energy tensor in the state @xmath48 .",
    "fortunately , because of the main result described in section [ s3.1 ] , we can lift the machinery of regularization and renormalization of this operator from qft in curved space - times to qft on the quantum flrw geometry encoded in @xmath14 .",
    "the result is that we need to require @xmath48 to be _ regular to 4th adiabatic order _",
    "w.r.t the dressed , effective metric @xmath58 ( since the stress - energy tensor is an operator of dimension 4 ) .",
    "if these two conditions are imposed initially , they are guaranteed to hold throughout the evolution .",
    "the last condition on @xmath48 is motivated by the test field approximation .",
    "we only assume that it holds _ initially _ ; whether it continues to hold in the subsequent evolution has to be checked explicitly .",
    "thus , the choice of the state @xmath71 is subject to three general constraints : i ) symmetry ; ii ) regularity ; and iii ) validity of the test field approximation at the _ initial instant of time_. however , because the @xmath70 symmetry is so much weaker than de sitter , these conditions do not suffice to select a unique state ; a large freedom still prevails .    at what time",
    "should the initial state be specified ?",
    "one possibility is to choose the bounce - time and another is to choose an instant in the distant past in the pre - bounce phase .",
    "both ideas have been pursued .",
    "for concreteness , in this section we will summarize the results that arise from the first choice which is motivated by the following considerations . as roger penrose , in particular , has emphasized , to account for the observed homogeneity in the cmb",
    ", one has to assume an extraordinary degree of homogeneity in the very early universe @xcite .",
    "note that , by itself , the near exponential expansion through 55 - 70 e - foldings of inflation does _ not _ solve this problem : one can still be left with a large inhomogeneity in the cmb , if one started with correspondingly larger inhomogeneities at the onset of inflation . in lqc",
    ", the observable universe expands from a ball of radius less than @xmath72 at the bounce .",
    "therefore , to arrive at the one part in @xmath73 homogeneity observed in the cmb , one needs this ball to be extraordinarily homogeneous . on the other hand , in the pre - bang , collapsing branch , one would expect the geometry to become increasingly wrinkly and complicated .",
    "however , as explained in section [ s2.1 ] , in lqg a repulsive force arises due to quantum geometry which is very effective in diluting such wrinkles in the planck regime .",
    "this ` smoothening effect ' appears to occur on the @xmath74 scale .",
    "therefore , it can provide a natural mechanism to iron out inhomogeneities , erasing the memory of the pre - bounce phase on balls of radius less than @xmath72 .",
    "this scenario provides a natural justification to specify the initial state at the bounce .",
    "more precisely , if we restrict ourselves to these balls at the bounce time , _ dynamical _ considerations from lqg may naturally lead to an initial state of the form @xmath75 where @xmath14 represents a quantum flrw geometry and @xmath48 a small perturbation thereon . in this section",
    ", we will discuss investigations based on this choice .",
    "however , we should emphasize that so far this reasoning has remained qualitative and serves only as a motivation rather than a watertight argument to specify the initial state at the bounce .",
    "to summarize , the strategy is to choose the state @xmath48 of perturbations at the bounce time satisfying the three conditions specified above . so far",

    "that is , the question has been : can we choose @xmath76 such that : i ) the test field approximation holds throughout the period in which quantum geometry effects are important ; and , ii ) the temperature - temperature correlations @xmath77 agree with observations within error bars ?",
    "detailed investigations have shown that such states do exist @xcite .",
    "the current work focuses on the following issues .",
    "are there interesting observable consequences for future mission ?",
    "are there differences from predictions of standard inflation ?",
    "if so , a possibilities of testing the planck scale physics of pre - inflationary dynamics would open up .",
    "finally , are there new physical principles that would narrow down the choice of the initial state only to those that are observationally viable ? that is , can observations inform quantum gravity ?",
    "one avenue to address these questions is to adopt the following viewpoint .",
    "the planck data shows a significant power suppression for @xmath6 and the origin of this @xmath2 effect is yet to be satisfactorily understood",
    ". it may be due to cosmic variance , or a feature of the late time evolution of the universe e.g .",
    ", the integrated sachs - wolf effect @xcite or may have primordial origin . from a quantum gravity perspective",
    ", it is natural to assume optimistically that the origin is primordial and explore consequences . in lqc , then , a concrete strategy is to seek initial conditions for @xmath48 at the bounce satisfying the three viability criteria listed in section [ s3.2 ] , _ and _ for which there is power suppression at low @xmath78 compatible with the @xmath2 planck findings . such initial conditions do exist .",
    "let us begin by examining the regime in which deviations from the standard bd predictions can arise .",
    "as explained in section [ s1 ] , pre - inflationary dynamics can lead to deviations for the longest wavelength modes since they experience curvature during their pre - inflationary evolution , get excited , and are therefore _ not _ in the bd state at the onset of inflation .",
    "the key question is whether these modes can be seen in the cmb , i.e. , if their wavelength is less than the radius of the observable universe .",
    "the answer depends on the number @xmath79 of e - foldings _ between the bounce and the onset of inflation . _",
    "detailed analysis shows that , if @xmath80 , then even the longest wavelength modes observed today would be inside the curvature radius from the bounce to the onset of inflation .",
    "then ( in the simplest scenario ) pre - inflationary dynamics would not lead to any observable departures from standard inflation based on the bd vacuum .",
    "on the other hand , if the @xmath81 , some observable modes will cross the curvature radius during the pre - inflationary phase , and not be in the bd vacuum at the onset of inflation . the number @xmath79 is determined by the pre - inflationary history of the background flrw geometry , which in turn is governed by the value @xmath34 of the inflaton at the bounce .",
    "detailed calculations show that @xmath82 if @xmath83 @xcite . on the other hand , as we saw in section [ s2.2 ] , to obtain a sufficiently long slow roll , we need @xmath84 . consequently , while we can choose initial conditions for @xmath48 so that there is agreement with the planck data within error bars , for all @xmath85 , in the simplest lqc scenario there is only a small window , @xmath86 , in which predictions can differ from standard inflation , based on the bd vacuum .",
    "furthermore , these deviations occur only for the longest wavelength modes with @xmath6 .",
    "the question then is whether one can arrive at the ` anomalies ' associated with the largest angular scales by restricting ourselves to this window .",
    "this is a primary focus of the current investigations in lqc .",
    "because space is limited , we can not describe all the ideas that are being pursued .",
    "here we will discuss just one choice of the initial conditions @xmath87 to illustrate how the interplay between lqc and observations is shaping up , and summarize another idea in section [ s5 ] .",
    "the results @xcite are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] . in this solution for @xmath75 ,",
    "the background quantum geometry state @xmath14 is sharply peaked around the effective trajectory determined by @xmath66 , and @xmath87 is such that there is power suppression for the longest wavelengths ( i.e. , for the lowest co - moving @xmath88 s ) .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "3 compares the theoretical power spectra for the curvature perturbation @xmath44 in lqc and in standard inflation . here",
    "@xmath89 is the wmap pivot mode , @xmath90 .",
    "the longest wavelength mode observable today corresponds to @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",
    "the solid ( blue ) curve is the best fit through the lqc ` data points ' shown with ( red ) crosses while the dotted ( black ) curve shows the prediction from standard inflation .",
    "it is clear that the two predictions agree for @xmath93 but in lqc there is power suppression for observable modes @xmath88 in the range @xmath94 .",
    "the right panel translates this result to the temperature - temperature correlations @xmath77 for direct comparison with observations .",
    "it shows that in lqc there is power suppression relative to standard inflationary prediction for @xmath6 , although both sets of predictions are within the planck error bars .",
    "thus , there are choices of initial conditions for @xmath48 satisfying the three constraints specified in [ s3.2 ] and , in addition , are such that : i ) for @xmath95 , ( where the observational error bars are tiny ) the resulting power spectrum agrees with that predicted by standard inflation and also with observations ; and , ii ) there is desired power suppression for @xmath96 .",
    "the fact that all these conditions are met simultaneously by the lqc pre - inflationary dynamics is non - trivial .",
    "but can one do even better ? can this choice of initial conditions be tested through future observations ? _ the answer is in the affirmative .",
    "_ one finds that there is also suppression at low @xmath78 for the t - e ( temperature - electric polarization ) and e - e correlations @xcite .",
    "these are shown in fig .",
    "an interesting aspect of this result is that it serves to distinguish the lqc primordial mechanism from the one tied to the late - time evolution of the universe through the integrated sachs - wolf effect @xcite because , in that case , there would not be power suppression in the e - e correlation functions .",
    "thus , if future observations show that the ( t - e and ) e - e correlation functions are suppressed relative to the standard inflationary prediction for @xmath96 , one would have a clear signal in favor of the primordial origin of these ` anomalies ' . from lqc standpoint , this would be the observable imprint of the planck scale , pre - inflationary dynamics .    to summarize ,",
    "if the lqc parameter @xmath34 is in a narrow window ( @xmath86 ) , there exist admissible initial conditions for the state @xmath48 of perturbations such that one can account for the planck data , including the power suppression at @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , there are predictions for future missions that distinguish this quantum - gravity based mechanism from non - primordial mechanisms for power suppression .",
    "this example illustrates the extent to which lqc has matured in recent years .",
    "we will now discuss the `` deformed algebra '' approach that focuses on consistency of the effective theory rather than the quantum geometry that underlies lqg .",
    "+ recall that the constraints of general relativity form a first class system  la dirac and this property is key to the consistency of the classical dynamics .",
    "it is not a priori clear whether this delicate consistency can persist in the effective theory that incorporates leading order quantum corrections , in particular in cosmological perturbation equations .",
    "furthermore , in background - independent frameworks , it is not clear whether one can rely on the standard covariance arguments @xcite , because the very notion of space - time is supposed to emerge in some way from solutions to the fundamental equations",
    ". the consistency of the quantum corrected equations must be ensured before they can be solved .",
    "the  deformed algebra \" approach puts a specific emphasis on issues of gauge .",
    "in other areas of physics , gauge fixing before quantization was shown to be harmless but the case of gravity is much more subtle than , say , yang - mills theories because dynamics is part of the gauge .",
    "this issue is here taken seriously by trying to build the algebra so that the constraints can be quantized without classical specifications of gauge or observables .",
    "+ in the  deformed algebra \" approach to lqc , one considers two kind of lqg - inspired corrections to the constraints .",
    "one is the so - called holonomy correction ( coming from the fact that loop quantization is based on holonomies , _",
    "i.e. _ exponentials of the connection , rather than connections themselves ) , and the other is the inverse - triad correction ( coming from terms in the hamiltonian constraint which can not be quantized directly but only after being re - expressed as a poisson bracket ) . in the following , only holonomy corrections will be considered as their interpretation is easier .",
    "the net effect of these corrections is now encoded in the replacement @xmath97 : = \\frac{\\sin(n\\bar{\\mu } \\gamma \\bar{k})}{n\\bar{\\mu}\\gamma},\\ ] ] where @xmath98 is some unknown integer , @xmath99 is the mean gravitational connection , and @xmath100 is the coordinate size of a loop . the quantum - corrected constraints resulting from this substitution are denoted by @xmath101 .",
    "if the replacement ( [ replacement ] ) is performed naively , the algebra reads @xmath102 where @xmath103 stand for anomaly terms and @xmath104 are structure functions .",
    "the consistency condition ( i.e. , closure of the algebra ) requires @xmath105 . in turn , very nicely , this condition imposes restrictions on the form of the quantum corrections . since the result is the modification of the constraint algebra of general relativity , as one would expect from the hojman - kuchar - teitelboim theorem @xcite , the quantum space - time structure",
    "can no longer be described in terms of a pseudo - riemaniann space - time metric @xcite .",
    "but it does have a well - defined _ canonical _ formulation using hypersurface deformations .",
    "+ the procedure can be described as follows .",
    "the quantum corrected constraints are explicitly written for the perturbations up to the desired order .",
    "then the poisson brackets are calculated .",
    "anomalies are evaluated .",
    "suitable counter - terms , which are required to vanish at the classical limit , are added to the expressions of constraints to ensure the anomaly freedom .",
    "the resulting theory is not only consistent but is also  somehow surprisingly  quite uniquely defined when matter is included .",
    "in addition , although the calculations are quite long and involve intricate expressions , the resulting final algebra is very simple and depends on a unique and elegant structure function which encodes all the modifications :    @xmath106    importantly , the unknown integers @xmath107 ( that can , in principle , be different from unity as long as one considers other terms than the simple @xmath108 term arising from the curvature of the connection ) entering the correction functions @xmath109 $ ] can _ all _ be determined unambiguously .",
    "the solution closes the algebra non - pertubatively .",
    "this strategy has been successfully followed for vector @xcite and scalar @xcite perturbations .",
    "it has been shown that a single algebra structure can be consistently written for _ all _ perturbations @xcite .",
    "it basically reads as : @xmath110,d [ n^a]\\right\\ } & = & d[m^b\\partial_b n^a - n^b\\partial_b m^a ] , \\\\ \\left\\{d[m^a],s^q[n]\\right\\ } & = & s^q[m^a\\partial_b n - n\\partial_a m^a ] ,   \\\\ \\left\\{s^q[m],s^q[n]\\right\\ } & = & \\omega   d\\left[q^{ab}(m\\partial_bn - n\\partial_bm)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the diffeomorphism and hamiltonian constraints , @xmath79 and @xmath113 are lapse functions , @xmath114 and @xmath115 are shift functions , @xmath116 is the  deformation factor \" ( equal to one in the classical theory with lorentzian signature ) , and the superscript @xmath117 indicates that the constraint is quantum corrected at the effective level .",
    "this algebra is elegant , simple , and presents some interesting features : in particular it leads to an effective signature change , somehow reminiscent of the hartle - hawking proposal , close to the bounce .",
    "when @xmath118 the spacetime structure is lorentzian but when @xmath119 , that is in the vicinity of the bounce , @xmath116 becomes negative and the spacetime structure becomes euclidean .",
    "strikingly , this effect has also been found independently following different paths in lqc @xcite .",
    "in particular , the first of these references relies on very different hypotheses ( using a model of patches of universe evolving independently in the longitudinal gauge ) .",
    "the fact that it leads to the same result strongly reinforces the conclusion . at this stage , perturbations in this framework have been analyzed according to two different philosophical viewpoints that we shall now briefly review .",
    "+ it is important to notice that , in any case , the equation of motion is now more complicated than in the  dressed metric \" approach described in section [ s3 ] . for the simplest example of tensor modes",
    ", it reads @xmath120 in conformal time , where the mode functions @xmath121 are related to the amplitude of the tensor modes of the metric perturbation @xmath122 , via @xmath123 .",
    "the key point to notice here is that the dynamics of the modes is not anymore driven only by the hierarchy between @xmath124 and @xmath125 ( _ i.e. _ , by the ratio between the length scale associated with the mode and the curvature radius ) : it is more complicated and quite a lot of new phenomena can appear , opening a wide phenomenology .",
    "+        the first viewpoint is to use the ",
    "silent surface\"corresponding to @xmath126 ( or , @xmath127 ) as the natural place for imposing initial conditions .",
    "this is a tantalizing hypothesis as space points are here decoupled ( as anticipated by the bkl conjecture which is here nicely demonstrated in this specific quantum gravity setting ) and fluctuations are naturally described by a white noise spectrum .",
    "the resulting cosmological power spectrum was derived in @xcite and specific issues were studied in @xcite .",
    "the second viewpoint is to propagate the perturbations through the phase @xmath128 ( when the hyperbolic equation becomes elliptic ) , setting initial conditions in the contracting branch of the universe .",
    "this is technically possible .",
    "the vacuum is well defined : far enough in the past , all modes are within the horizon and it makes sense to set initial conditions  earlier \" in time and as far as possible from the highly quantum region .",
    "the resulting power spectrum was derived in @xcite .",
    "it exhibits an infrared behavior in agreement with gr , an exponentially diverging uv limit .",
    "second , because back - reaction should then be taken into account .",
    "this just gives the general trend of the behavior .",
    "] and oscillations in - between .",
    "those oscillations can easily be interpreted as coming from a potential well in the shrdinger - like equation describing the evolution of perturbations .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the kind of primordial spectra expected in this framework .",
    "+ the important point for detection is the number of e - folds that take place between the bounce and the contemporary universe . for most solutions ,",
    "the number is very high and the relevant modes are trans - planckian at the bounce ( this is true both for the  dressed metric \" and for the  deformed algebra \" approaches ) .",
    "however , for a restricted set of initial conditions , the observational window does fall in the non - trivial part of the spectrum and has interesting features that might be discovered by future experiments devoted to the polarized cmb .",
    "that quantum geometry effects of lqc can naturally lead to a resolution of the big - bang singularity was first realized over a decade ago @xcite .",
    "a large body of subsequent work , summarized in @xcite , has significantly sharpened the key ideas and made them robust .",
    "the community also has detailed results on the generic emergence of a slow roll inflationary phase for the @xmath129 and the starobinsky potentials .",
    "other potentials and multi - inflaton models have also been considered and the qualitative results are the same .",
    "thus , on the whole , there is broad consensus in the lqc community on the results reported in section [ s2 ] .",
    "investigations of cosmological perturbations within lqc are more recent . in all approaches ,",
    "one focuses on the _ ` cosmological sector ' _ of classical general relativity , consisting of the flrw solutions with inflation as matter source , together with the first order perturbations .",
    "this subject has been pursued along related but technically different directions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these investigations provide a healthy diversity . in this brief overview",
    ", we could only include illustrative examples from this growing body of results .",
    "in section [ s3 ] we discussed the most developed of these approaches . here , perturbations are treated as quantum fields propagating on background , flrw _ quantum _ geometries discussed in section [ s2 ] .",
    "self - consistency of solutions is checked through detailed calculations of the back reaction , and a large number of observational consequences have been systematically worked out . in the second approach , summarized in section [ s4 ] , the viewpoint is rather different : the goal is to capture the leading order quantum corrections that would arise in _ any _ consistent hamiltonian quantization of the cosmological sector that is based on connection variables .",
    "the idea is to encode these corrections in modifications of the gr constraint equations that are subject to the condition that the poisson algebra of the modified constraints also closes , i.e. , is anomaly - free .",
    "recently , phenomenological consequences of the resulting modified equations of motion have been worked out .",
    "interestingly , although the two approaches are conceptually quite different , their predictions agree for a range of intermediate wavelengths , but differ from standard inflation @xcite .    at present",
    "both approaches have certain limitations . in the first approach ,",
    "the true degrees of freedom for the first order perturbations are extracted at the classical level , prior to quantization .",
    "while this is an internally consistent procedure , as a check of robustness , it is of interest to first pass to the quantum theory and _ then _ extract the true degrees of freedom by imposing the full set of quantum constraints for the background as well as perturbations .",
    "this check has not been carried out .",
    "a second limitation , shared by all lqc approaches to date , is that quantization is carried out through a scheme that is ` hybrid ' in the following sense .",
    "the quantum theory of the background flrw sector is based on quantum geometry techniques from lqg and they lie at the heart of singularity resolution .",
    "but then , in the resulting quantum geometry , perturbations are quantized  la fock , rather than by using lqg techniques .",
    "this strategy is motivated by the expectation that the fock states of perturbations should provide an excellent approximation of the loop quantized states because the energy density in perturbations is small .",
    "but as of now there is no detailed analysis justifying this expectation . for the second approach , one limitation is that the modified gr constraint equations used at the start of the analysis are not systematically derived .",
    "rather , an ansatz is made at the start of the calculation so that the required calculations are tractable .",
    "also , in presence of these modifications , the notion of space - time covariance has to be revisited and the hope that there may be an underlying non - commutative geometry is yet to be realized",
    ". finally , recent calculations @xcite have shown that this ` anomaly - free ' method leads to an exponentially growing blue tilt at small angular scales ( in contrast to standard inflation , and the approach described in section [ s3 ] , both of which have a small red shift ) .",
    "this blue tilt would lead to a large back reaction and the issue of finding a self - consistent solution remains open in this approach .",
    "we will conclude with a few examples of work in progress .",
    "so far , most of the detailed investigations have been carried out with the quadratic potential for the inflaton .",
    "other potentials , particularly the one that features in the starobinsky inflation , are now being analyzed in detail @xcite .",
    "results to date already shows that the features reported in section [ s3 ] are robust .",
    "second , so far , the detailed analysis has used states @xmath14 for the background geometry that are sharply peaked",
    ". currently more general states in which the uncertainty in the scale factor even higher than @xmath0% are being used .",
    "interestingly , more general states do not introduce new parameters vis a vis observations : the power spectrum that results from the widely spread background states is the same as the power spectrum from sharply peaked states , just with a shift in value of the lqc phenomenological parameter @xmath34 .",
    "the origin of this rather surprising effect is now understood in terms of the role played by the microscopic parameter , the area gap @xmath7 , in the theory .",
    "more vigorous effort is being made to probe and control the freedom in the choice initial conditions for the quantum state @xmath48 of perturbations . in section [ s3 ] we considered one choice that directly leads to power suppression .",
    "but there are other choices @xcite ( also satisfying the three viability criteria of section [ s3.2 ] ) for which the power spectrum is enhanced for wavelengths that are larger than the radius of the observable universe . in presence of interactions ,",
    "correlations between observable modes and these unobservable super - horizon modes produces a modulation in the power spectrum of observable modes .",
    "furthermore , unlike in mechanisms proposed in @xcite , the lqc amplitude modulation _ decays _ at smaller angular scales and is thus compatible with observations .",
    "this opens an interesting possibility of obtaining significant non - gaussian correlations only between the longest wavelength modes we can observe and even longer wavelength modes that we can not .",
    "this mechanism could then be used to account for the observed @xmath2 anomalies at large angular scale @xcite .",
    "furthermore these considerations appear to _ reduce _ the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath130 , thereby pushing the @xmath129 potential to the ` allowed region ' of the planck data .",
    "thus , the issue of whether these anomalies can be accounted for using planck scale physics is being approached from several different directions within lqc . because the final observational predictions are tied with the choice of initial conditions , these diverse investigations open up the interesting possibility of constraining the initial conditions at the bounce through observations .",
    "more precisely , using guidance from observations it may now be feasible to uncover a fundamental principle dictating initial conditions that has eluded us so far .",
    "an attractive possibility in this direction is to seek an appropriate quantum generalization of penrose s weyl curvature hypothesis @xcite . another possibility is suggested by the `` deformed algebra '' approach along the lines of @xcite .",
    "such rather diverse investigations are now actively in progress .    in the cosmology literature , it is often implicitly assumed that planck scale physics would inform the discussion of the early universe mainly by explaining the origin of the inflaton(s ) and providing us the potential(s ) that dictate their dynamics .",
    "investigations in lqc are silent on these issues because these issues have their origin in particle physics .",
    "but lqc has opened another , complementary , window .",
    "quantum geometry underlying lqg introduces specific changes in the dynamics of gr in the ultraviolet that lead to the resolution of the big bang singularity .",
    "interestingly , the new quantum flrw geometry modifies the dynamics of the longest wavelength modes of perturbations , thereby providing avenues to account for the @xmath2 anomalies seen at the largest angular scale .",
    "the resulting two - way interplay between theory and observations has the potential of enriching both .",
