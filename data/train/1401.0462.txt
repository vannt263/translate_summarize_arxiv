    "modern financial markets have developed lives of their own .",
    "this fact makes it necessary that we not only monitor financial markets as an `` auxiliary system '' of the economy , but that we develop a methodology for evaluating them , their feedback on the real economy , and their effect on society as a whole @xcite .",
    "the events of the recent past have clearly demonstrated that the everyday life of the majority of the world s population is tied to the well - being of the financial system .",
    "individuals are invested in stock markets either directly or indirectly , and shocks to the system ( be they endogenous or exogenous ) have an immense and immediate impact .",
    "thus the need for a robust and efficient financial system is becoming stronger and stronger .",
    "these two critical concepts have been discussed and heatedly debated for the past century , with the efficient market hypothesis ( emh ) in the center of the debate .",
    "the emh @xcite stipulates that all available information ( or only past prices in the weak variant of the hypothesis ) is already reflected in the current price and it is therefore not possible to predict future values in any statistical method based on past records @xcite .",
    "the emh has been questioned by applying statistical tests to nyse returns @xcite in which the authors formulated the problem equivalent to the emh , and showed by contrast that an efficient compression algorithm they proposed was able to utilize structure in the data  which would not be possible if the hypothesis were in fact true .",
    "the possibility for such compression suggests the data must be somehow structured .",
    "this encourages us to explore methods of modeling and exploring this structure in ways that can be applied to real - world markets .",
    "many efforts have thus been devoted to uncovering the true nature of the underlying structure of financial markets .",
    "much attention has been given to understanding correlations in financial markets and their dynamics , for both daily @xcite and intra - day time scales @xcite .",
    "more recently , other measures of similarity have been introduced , such as granger - causality analysis @xcite and partial correlation analysis @xcite , both of which aim to quantify how the behavior of one financial asset provides information about the behavior of a second asset . for these different measures of co -",
    "movement in financial markets , however , the main question that remains is how to uncover underlying meaningful information .",
    "an analysis of synchronous correlations of equity returns has shown that a financial market usually displays a nested structure in which all the stock returns are driven by a common factor , e.g. , a market index , and are then organized in groups of like economic activity  such as technology , services , utilities , or energy  that exhibit higher values of average pair correlation . within each group ,",
    "stocks belonging to the same sub - sector of economic activity , e.g. , `` insurance '' and `` regional banks '' within the financial sector , show an even higher correlation degree .",
    "such a structure has been recognized using very different methods of analysis , ranging from random matrix theory @xcite , to hierarchical clustering @xcite , to correlation based networks @xcite .",
    "the several methods devised to construct correlation based networks can be grouped into two main categories : threshold methods and topological / hierarchical methods .",
    "both approaches start from a sample correlation matrix or , more generally , a sample similarity measure . using the threshold method we set a correlation threshold and construct a network in which any two nodes are linked if their correlation is larger than the threshold .",
    "as we lower the threshold value we see the formation of groups of stocks ( economic sub - sectors ) that progressively merge to form larger groups ( economic sectors ) and finally merge into a single group ( the market ) .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that , due to the finite length of data series , threshold networks are very robust to correlation uncertainty .",
    "the disadvantage of threshold based networks is that it is difficult to find a single threshold value to display , in a single network , the nested structure of the correlation matrix of stock returns ( see @xcite ) .",
    "topological methods to construct correlation based networks , such as the minimal spanning tree ( mst ) @xcite or the planar maximally - filtered graph ( pmfg ) @xcite , are based solely on the ranking of empirical correlations .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that these methods are intrinsically hierarchical and are able to display the nested structure of stock - return correlations in a financial market .",
    "the disadvantage of this approach is that these methods are less stable than threshold methods with respect to the statistical uncertainty of data series , and it is difficult to include information about the statistical significance of correlations and their ranking @xcite .",
    "thus it is a challenge of modern network science to uncover the significant relationships ( links ) between the components ( nodes ) of the investigated system @xcite .    although much attention has been devoted to the study of synchronous correlation networks of equity returns ( see @xcite for a review of the topic ) ,",
    "comparatively few results have been obtained for networks of lagged correlations @xcite .",
    "neither method of constructing correlation based networks is readily extendable to the study of directed lagged correlations in a financial market .",
    "the lagged correlations in stock returns are small , even at time horizons as short as five minutes , and are thus strongly influenced by the statistical uncertainty of the estimation process .",
    "the use of topological methods to construct a lagged - correlation based network of stock returns is difficult because they only take into consideration the ranking of correlations and not their actual values .",
    "the result could be a network in which many links are simply caused by statistical fluctuations .",
    "on the other hand , standard threshold methods are also difficult to apply because it is difficult to find an appropriate threshold level and , more importantly , the threshold selected in these methods is usually the same for all stock pairs .",
    "this is a problem if we want to study lagged correlations because the statistical significance of a lagged - correlation may depend on the return distribution of the corresponding pair of stocks , and such distributions might vary across stocks  a consequence , for example , of the different liquidity of stocks .",
    "here we introduce a method for filtering a lagged correlation matrix into a network of statistically - validated directed links that takes into account the heterogeneity of stock return distributions .",
    "this is done by associating a @xmath0-value with each observed lagged - correlation and then setting a threshold on @xmath0-values , i.e. , setting a level of statistical significance corrected for multiple hypothesis testing .",
    "we apply our method to describe the structure of lagged relationships between intraday equity returns sampled at high frequencies in financial markets . in particular , we investigate how the structure of the network changes with increasing return sampling frequency , and compare the results using data from both the periods 20022003 and 20112012 .",
    "it should be noted that the two investigated time periods are quite different if we consider that the fraction of volume exchanged by algorithmic trading in the us equity markets has increased from approximately 20% in 2003 to more than 50% in 2011 . in both periods",
    "we find a large growth in the connectedness of the networks as we increase the sampling frequency .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 introduces the method used to filter and validate statistically significant lagged correlations from transaction data .",
    "section  3 analyzes the structure of the resulting networks and investigates how this structure evolves with changing return sampling frequency . in sec .",
    "4 we discuss the application of our method to the construction of synchronous correlation networks . finally , in sec .  5",
    "we discuss the implications of our results for the efficiency and stability of financial markets .",
    "we begin the analysis by calculating the matrix of logarithmic returns over given intraday time - horizons .",
    "we denote by @xmath1 the most recent transaction price for stock @xmath2 occurring on or before time @xmath3 during the trading day .",
    "we define the opening price of the stock to be the price of its first transaction of the trading day .",
    "let @xmath4 be the time horizon .",
    "then for each stock we sample the logarithmic returns , @xmath5 every @xmath4 minutes throughout the trading day , and assemble these time series as columns in a matrix @xmath6 .",
    "we then filter @xmath6 into two matrices , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , in which we exclude returns during the last period @xmath4 of each trading day from @xmath7 and returns during the first period @xmath4 of each trading day from @xmath8 . from these data we construct an",
    "empirical lagged correlation matrix @xmath9 using the pearson correlation coefficient of columns of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the mean and sample standard deviation , respectively , of column @xmath13 of @xmath7 , and @xmath14 is the number of rows in @xmath7 ( and @xmath8 ) . here",
    "we set the lag to be one time horizon @xmath4 .",
    "a schematic of this sum is diagrammed in fig .",
    "[ fig : lag_schem ] .     minutes .",
    "the sum @xmath15 is generated using products of returns from stocks @xmath13 and @xmath2 that are linked by an arrow .",
    "we consider only time horizons @xmath4 that divide evenly into the 390 minute trading day . ]",
    "the matrix @xmath9 can be considered a weighted adjacency matrix for a fully connected , directed graph . to filter the links in this graph according to a threshold of statistical significance , we apply a shuffling technique @xcite .",
    "the rows of @xmath7 are shuffled repeatedly without replacement in order to create a large number of surrogated time series of returns .",
    "after each shuffling we re - calculate the lagged correlation matrix ( [ eqn : corr_matrix ] ) and compare this shuffled lagged correlation matrix @xmath16 to the empirical matrix @xmath9 . for each shuffling",
    "we thus have an independent realization of @xmath16 .",
    "we then construct the matrices @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the number of realizations for which @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the number of realizations for which @xmath22 .    from matrix @xmath17",
    "we associate a one - tailed @xmath0-value with all positive correlations as the probability of observing a correlation that is equal to or higher than the empirically - measured correlation .",
    "similarly , from @xmath18 we associate a one - tailed @xmath0-value with all negative correlations . in this analysis we set the threshold at @xmath23 .",
    "we must adjust our statistical threshold , however , to account for multiple comparisons .",
    "we use the conservative bonferroni correction for a given sample size of @xmath24 stocks .",
    "for example , for @xmath25 stocks the corrected threshold will be @xmath26 .",
    "we thus construct @xmath27 independently shuffled surrogate time series .",
    "if @xmath28 we can associate a statistically - validated positive link from stock @xmath13 to stock @xmath2 ( @xmath23 , bonferroni correction ) .",
    "likewise , if @xmath29 we can associate a statistically - validated negative link from stock @xmath13 to stock @xmath2 . in this way",
    "we construct the bonferroni network @xcite . in appendix",
    "a we discuss the probability that using our approximated method we will wrongly indentify a link as statistically significant ( i.e. , have a false positive ) .    for the sake of comparison , for each time horizon @xmath4",
    "we also construct the network using @xmath0-values corrected according to the false discovery rate ( fdr ) protocol @xcite .",
    "this correction is less conservative than the bonferroni correction and is constructed as follows .",
    "the @xmath0-values from each individual test are arranged in increasing order ( @xmath30 ) , and the threshold is defined as the largest @xmath31 such that @xmath32 . in the fdr network our threshold for the matrices @xmath17 or @xmath18 is thus not zero but the largest integer @xmath31 such that @xmath17 or @xmath18 has exactly @xmath31 entries fewer than or equal to @xmath31 . from this threshold",
    "we can filter the links in @xmath9 to construct the fdr network @xcite .",
    "we note that the bonferroni network is a subgraph of the fdr network .    because we make no assumptions about the return distributions , this randomization approach is especially useful in high - dimensional systems in which it can be difficult to infer the joint probability distribution from the data @xcite .",
    "we also impose no topological constraints on the bonferroni or fdr networks .",
    "this method serves to identify the significant positive and negative lagged correlation coefficients in a way that accounts for heterogeneities in relationships between the returns of stocks .",
    "an alternative , but closely related approach would be to construct a theoretical distribution for correlation coefficients under the null hypothesis of uncorrelated returns sampled from a given joint distribution @xcite .",
    "for a desired confidence level , one could then construct a threshold correlation , beyond which empirical correlations are validated .",
    "such an approach typically assumes equal marginal distributions for returns , and must fix a uniform correlation threshold for all relationships . at the expense of computational time ,",
    "our method is flexible in that it permits heterogeneities in marginal distributions .",
    "we compare the results of the two approaches in appendix b.",
    "we study and compare two different datasets .",
    "the first dataset comprises returns of 100 companies with the largest market capitalization on the new york stock exchange ( nyse ) during the period 20022003 ( 501 trading days ) , which was investigated in @xcite .",
    "for the second dataset we consider returns during the period 20112012 ( 502 trading days ) of 100 companies with the largest market capitalization on the nyse as of december 31 , 2012 ( retrieved from the trades and quotes database , wharton research data services , http://wrds-web.wharton.upenn.edu/wrds/ ) .",
    "market capitalization figures were obtained from yahoo finance web service ( http://finance.yahoo.com ) . for each company",
    "we obtain intraday transaction records .",
    "these records provide transaction price data at a time resolution of one second .",
    "the stocks under consideration are quite liquid , helping to control for the problem of asynchronous transactions and artificial lead - lag relationships due to different transaction frequencies @xcite .",
    "we sample returns at time horizons of 5 , 15 , 30 , 65 , and 130 minutes .",
    "we report summary statistics in table [ summary_table ] , including the lengths of time series @xmath14 from equation ( [ eqn : corr_matrix ] ) , as well as the mean @xmath33 and standard deviation @xmath34 of synchronous pearson correlation coefficients between distinct columns of the returns matrix @xmath6 for each time horizon @xmath4 .",
    "we also show the mean @xmath35 and standard deviation @xmath36 of entries in the lagged correlation matrix @xmath9 .",
    "[ summary_table ]    figure [ fig : bounds ] displays bounds on the positive and negative coefficients selected by this method for both bonferroni and fdr networks at a time horizon of @xmath37 minutes",
    ".     stocks at a time horizon @xmath37 minutes .",
    "the minimum positive coefficients and maximum negative coefficients selected using both bonferroni and fdr filtering procedures are shown .",
    "we note that these methods select coefficients from the tails of the distribution , without fixing a uniform threshold for all pairs of stocks . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : networks ] we display plots of each statistically validated lagged correlation network obtained from the 20112012 data ( bonferroni correction ) . at time horizons of @xmath38 minutes and @xmath39 minutes",
    "we validate one and two links , respectively .",
    "it is somewhat remarkable that we uncover any persistent relationships at such long time horizons .",
    "we see a striking increase in the number of validated links at small intraday time horizons , below @xmath40 minutes in particular .",
    "this is likely due to a confluence of two effects : ( i ) with decreasing @xmath4 we increase the length @xmath14 of our time series , gaining statistical power and therefore the ability to reject the null hypothesis ; ( ii ) at small @xmath4 we approach the timescales over which information and returns spill over across different equities . in appendix c we provide evidence that diminishing the time horizon @xmath4 reveals more information about the system than is obtained by increasing the time series length @xmath14 alone .",
    "it is clear visually that the validated links of positive correlation vastly outnumber the validated links of negative correlation .",
    "we plot the number of validated links in both the bonferroni and fdr networks for the 20022003 and 20112012 datasets in fig .",
    "[ fig : number_links ] , where the decrease in number of all validated links for increasing time horizon is apparent .",
    "note that for a given time horizon we usually validate more links in the 20022003 dataset than in the 20112012 dataset .",
    "this suggests that there has been an increase in market efficiency over the past decade .",
    "we revisit this idea in subsequent portions of this paper , where we study the properties of the network in- and out - degree distributions and the characterization of three - node motifs .",
    "we also explore how the number of validated links decreases for a fixed time horizon @xmath4 but a changing time lag .",
    "we build a lag @xmath41 into the lagged correlation matrix ( [ eqn : corr_matrix ] ) by excluding the last @xmath41 returns of each trading day from matrix @xmath7 and the first @xmath41 returns of each trading day from matrix @xmath8 .",
    "thus the present analysis uses @xmath42 . in appendix c",
    "we plot the decreasing number of validated links with increasing @xmath41 for @xmath43 minutes .",
    "we must also measure the extent to which the number of validated lead - lag relationships can be disentangled from the strength of those relationships .",
    "figure  [ fig : lagged_coeffs ] thus shows plots of the average magnitude of lagged correlation coefficients selected by the bonferroni and fdr networks .",
    "although we validate more links at small time horizons , we note that the average magnitude of the selected coefficients tends to decrease . at short time horizons",
    "@xmath4 we correlate time series of comparatively large length @xmath14 , narrowing the distribution of entries in the shuffled lagged correlation matrix @xmath16 and gaining statistical power .",
    "we are thus able to reject the null hypothesis even for lead - lag relationships with a modest correlation coefficient .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : degrees ] we characterize the topologies of the statistically - validated networks by studying the properties of their in - degree and out - degree distributions .",
    "we make two observations .",
    "first , we note that both the in - degree and out - degree distributions appear more homogeneous in the 20022003 period than the 20112012 period , i.e. , the 20112012 data exhibit large heterogeneities , particularly in the in - degree distributions , in which many nodes have small degrees but few nodes have very large degrees , as can be seen in the extended tails of the distributions .",
    "second , we observe that in both the 20022003 and 20112012 data there are more nodes with large in - degrees than out - degrees . although few individual stocks have a strong influence on the larger financial market , it appears that the larger financial market has a strong influence on many individual stocks , especially at short time horizons .",
    "we further investigate this point by studying the relative occurrence of three - node network motifs in the bonferroni networks @xcite .",
    "we find that , of all motifs featuring more than one link , the `` 021u '' motif ( two nodes influencing a common third node ) occurs frequently in the recent data , and in fact occurs in over 80% of node triplets having more than one link between them for time horizons greater than @xmath38 minutes . in the 20022003 data",
    "this motif is also the most common at every time horizon except @xmath44 minutes .",
    "figure  [ fig : motifs ] plots the occurrence frequencies of these motifs .",
    "these features can be related to the information efficiency of the market . in the 20112012 dataset",
    "we find a dominant motif in which a large number of stocks influence only a few other stocks .",
    "predictive information regarding a given stock , therefore , tends to be encoded in the price movements of many other stocks and so is difficult to extract and exploit .",
    "in contrast , the distributions of degrees and motifs in the 20022003 data are more homogeneous .",
    "although there are more nodes with large in - degrees , there are also more nodes with large out - degrees . if a stock has a large out - degree , its price movements influence the price movements of many other stocks .",
    "these sources of exploitable information have all but disappeared over the past decade .     min . ) , 1,296 ( @xmath45 min . ) , 17,545 ( @xmath43 min . ) , and 92,673 ( @xmath46 min . ) . in 2011 - 2012",
    "these counts are 1 ( @xmath39 min . ) , 9,171 ( @xmath45 min . ) , 13,303 ( @xmath43 min . ) , and 35,405 ( @xmath46 min . ) . ]",
    "to construct synchronous correlation networks using the methodology described in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] , we use the unfiltered columns of @xmath6 as our time series such that each entry @xmath15 of the empirical correlation matrix is the pearson correlation between columns @xmath13 and @xmath2 of @xmath6 .",
    "we then independently shuffle the columns of @xmath6 , without replacement , when constructing the surrogated time series .",
    "we find that with the same significance threshold of @xmath23 , in 2011 - 2012 both the bonferroni and fdr networks are almost fully connected , with well over 4500 of the @xmath47 possible links validated in all networks over all time horizons .",
    "our method is thus quite sensitive to the presence or absence of correlations between time series .",
    "figure  [ fig : epps ] plots the empirical synchronous correlations against time horizon for all stocks considered in both datasets .",
    "we see a clear increase in the magnitude of these coefficients as the time horizon grows , a phenomenon known as the epps effect @xcite .",
    "it is known that lagged correlations may in part contribute to this effect @xcite .",
    "the extent of this contribution is an active area of investigation @xcite .",
    "the synchronous correlations are also significantly higher in the recent data , suggesting that , despite the increased efficiencies shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : number_links ] , there is also an increase in co - movements in financial markets since 2003 , heightening the risk of financial contagion ( see for example @xcite ) .    figure [ fig : sync_corr_hist ] shows the distribution of correlation coefficients at @xmath43 minutes for both 20022003 and 20112012 datasets .",
    "we observe a slightly bi - modal distribution of synchronous correlation coefficients in the 20022003 data across all time horizons @xmath4 .",
    "most coefficients are positive , but there is also a small number of negative coefficients among these high market capitalization stocks .",
    "this quality disappears in the 20112012 data , and all correlation coefficients are positive .",
    "in this paper , we propose a method for the construction of statistically validated correlation networks .",
    "the method is applicable to the construction of both lagged ( directed ) and synchronous ( undirected ) networks , and imposes no topological constraints on the networks .",
    "the sensitivity of the method to small deviations from the null hypothesis of uncorrelated returns makes it less useful for studying the synchronous correlations of stocks , as these equities tend to display a considerable degree of correlation and we validate almost all possible links in the network .",
    "the method is apt , however , for the study of lagged correlation networks .",
    "we are able to adjust the sensitivity of the method with our choice of @xmath0-value and protocol for multiple comparisons . here",
    "we show that , with the conservative bonferroni correction and @xmath0-value=0.01 , we are able to compare changes in network connectivity with increasing return sampling frequency between old and new datasets .",
    "the primary drawback to our method is its computational burden , which grows as @xmath48 for @xmath24 time series .",
    "we find that for timescales longer than one hour , significant lead - lag relationships that capture return and information spill - over virtually disappear .",
    "for timescales smaller than 30 minutes , however , we are able to validate hundreds of relationships . according to the efficient market hypothesis there can be no arbitrage opportunities in informationally - efficient financial markets",
    "however , lagged correlations may not be easily exploitable due to the presence of market frictions , including transaction costs , the costs of information processing , and borrowing constraints .    between the time periods 20022003 and 20112012 ,",
    "the synchronous correlations among these high market capitalization stocks grow considerably , but the number of validated lagged - correlation relationships diminish .",
    "we relate these two behaviors to an increase in the risks of financial contagion and an increase in the informational efficiency of the market , respectively .",
    "we find that networks from both periods exhibit asymmetries between their in - degree and out - degree distributions . in both there are more nodes with large in - degrees than large out - degrees , but in the 20112012 data , nodes with large in - degrees are represented by the extended tails of the degree distribution and , in contrast , the 20022003 distribution exhibits a greater uniformity . a comparison between in - degree and out - degree distributions shows that nodes with high in - degree are much more likely than nodes with high out - degree , especially for the 20112012 data .",
    "this evidence is also interpreted in terms of informational efficiency of the market .",
    "indeed a large out - degree of a stock implies that knowledge of its return , at a given time , may provide information about the future return of a large number of other stocks . on the other hand ,",
    "a large in - degree of a stock indicates that information about its return at a given time can be accessed through the knowledge of past returns of many stocks .",
    "there are also many more nodes with large out - degrees in the 20022003 data than in the 20112012 data .",
    "we relate these observations to an increased information efficiency in the market .",
    "such an interpretation is also supported by the analysis of three - node motifs , which shows an apparent dominance of motif 021u with respect to all the others .    in the future , we could extend this work by incorporating a prediction model to measure the degree to which the information contained in these validated networks is exploitable in the presence of market frictions .",
    "we could also investigate the characteristics of nodes belonging to different industries , as well as the presence of intraday seasonalities @xcite .",
    "such features are potentially relevant to prediction models .",
    "finally , although our analysis restricts itself to using the pearson product - moment correlation , other measures , such as a lagged hayashi - yoshida estimator @xcite , could be used to probe correlations at the smallest ( inter - trade ) timescales while minimizing the problem of asynchronous trades .",

    "the one - tailed @xmath0-value associated with positive correlations represents the probability of observing a correlation between two elements , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , that is larger than or equal to the one observed , @xmath51 , under the null hypothesis that @xmath49 and @xmath50 are uncorrelated , @xmath52 our objective in the paper is to select all the correlations with a @xmath0-value smaller than a given univariate statistical threshold @xmath53 , e.g. , @xmath54 or @xmath55 , corrected for multiple hypothesis testing through the bonferroni correction , that is , divided by the total number of tests , @xmath56 in our case ( where @xmath25 is the number of stocks ) .",
    "the question is : _ what is the probability that a correlation with a p - value @xmath0 larger or equal to @xmath57 is ( wrongly ) indicated as a statistically significant one according to the shuffling method?_. operatively , _",
    "what is the probability that , over the @xmath58 independent replicates of the data , a correlation between @xmath49 and @xmath50 larger than the observed one has never been observed ? _",
    "if we set the @xmath0-value , @xmath0 , of @xmath51 equal to @xmath59 ( where @xmath60 is a quantity that ranges between @xmath61 and @xmath56 ) the question is : what is the probability that , over @xmath58 independent draws ( @xmath62 bootstrap replicates with our method ) a value of correlation larger than @xmath51 is never obtained ?",
    "this probability is @xmath63 where  null \" indicates the event that a value of correlation larger than @xmath51 has never been obtained over @xmath58 random replicates of data .",
    "this probability can be used to calculate the probability that @xmath64 is larger than or equal to @xmath57 , conditioned to the event that a value of correlation larger than @xmath51 has never been obtained over @xmath58 draws .",
    "this is done using bayes rule , under the assumption that the marginal distribution of @xmath0-value @xmath0 is uniform in @xmath65 $ ] , i.e. , the density function is @xmath66 and then , integrating over @xmath0 , @xmath67 where we used the fact that @xmath68 @xmath69 . in our method , @xmath70 , and",
    "the sample size is @xmath25 .",
    "therefore @xmath71 it is interesting to note that , as soon as the level of statistical significance is corrected through the bonferroni correction ( @xmath72 ) , where @xmath53 is the univariate level of statistical significance , and the number , @xmath73 , of independent replicates is a multiple of the number of tests , @xmath58 , the probability @xmath74 is approximately independent of the sample size ( @xmath24 ) .    with our approximated method to estimate correlation p - values , the probability that we select a positive correlation as a statistically significant one at the confidence level @xmath75 ,",
    "while it is actually not significant at that level of statistical confidence , is @xmath76 .",
    "however , the probability that a significant correlation according to our method has a @xmath0-value larger then @xmath77 is already quite small : @xmath78 . in other words ,",
    "if we obtain a validated network with 1,000 links , i.e. , 1,000 validated positive correlations according to our approximated method , we expect that , on average , only 7 correlations will have a one - tailed @xmath0-value larger than @xmath79 .",
    "here we compare ( for a sub - set of our data ) the number of significant correlations obtained according to the presented bootstrap approach and the number of significant correlations that we may have obtained relying upon the analytical distribution of sample pair correlations of normally distributed data .",
    "if @xmath80 and @xmath81 are uncorrelated variables that follow a normal distribution , then the probability density function of the sample correlation coefficient , @xmath82 , between @xmath80 and @xmath81 is @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath14 is the length of the sample and @xmath84 is the euler beta function of parameters @xmath60 and @xmath0 . given a level of statistical significance , @xmath85 ( already corrected for multiple hypothesis testing ) , @xmath86 can be used to set a threshold for the correlation value @xmath87 such that the probability @xmath88 is @xmath89 according to this analysis , for a data sample of @xmath24 time series , each one of length @xmath14 , we can say that an observed correlation , @xmath51 , is statistically significant if @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is obtained by ( numerically ) solving the previous non linear equation .",
    "table b1 shows the 20022003 dataset and reports the length of data series used to calculate lagged correlations ( column 1 ) at a given time horizon ( column 2 ) , the quantity @xmath91 such that @xmath92 ( column 3 ) , the number of validated positive correlations ( column 4 ) , and the number of validated negative correlations ( column 5 ) .",
    "table b2 shows the number of validated positive correlations ( i ) according to the shuffling method ( column 3 ) , ( ii ) according to the analytical method discussed above ( column 4 ) , and ( iii ) common to both methods ( column 5 ) .",
    "the results reported in the table show that the bootstrap method we used is more conservative than the analytical method based on the assumption that return time series follow a normal distribution .",
    "indeed the number of validated positive correlations according to the bootstrap method is always smaller than the one obtained using the theoretical approach .",
    "furthermore , most of the correlations validated according to the bootstrap method are also validated according to the theoretical method .",
    "a similar discussion can be held about the validation of negative correlations .",
    "we explore how the number of validated links decreases when the time horizon @xmath4 is fixed and the time lag variable @xmath41 increases .",
    "a lag @xmath41 is built into the lagged correlation matrix ( [ eqn : corr_matrix ] ) by excluding the last @xmath41 returns of each trading day from matrix @xmath7 and the first @xmath41 returns of each trading day from matrix @xmath8 .",
    "thus the results presented in the main text are restricted to @xmath93 .",
    "figure  [ fig : variable_lag ] plots the number of positive links and negative links validated in the 20112012 data for @xmath43 minutes as @xmath41 increases .",
    "although for this @xmath4 the length @xmath14 of the time series in @xmath7 and @xmath8 decrease by only @xmath94% for each additional lag @xmath41 ( as each 390 minute trading day includes @xmath95 returns ) , we observe a sharp decrease in the number of validated links as @xmath41 increases .",
    "the number of validated negative links is an order of magnitude smaller than the number of positive links , so the small peak in negative links at @xmath96 for the fdr network is likely an artifact of noise .",
    "we also investigate the effect of the time series length @xmath14 on the numbers of validated links . for @xmath43 minutes , we partition the entire 2011 - 2012 time series into segments of length @xmath97 , as this is the length of the time series for the longest time horizon considered ( @xmath38 minutes ) . for each segment",
    "we generate the lagged correlation network using @xmath27 surrogate time series , as before .",
    "we find that the union of all such bonferroni networks consists of 124 distinct links , 104 of which are positive and 20 of which are negative .",
    "although this number is 27% of the number of links validated in the @xmath43 minute network that was not partitioned ( @xmath98 ) , it stands in contrast to the single link that was validated in the @xmath38 minute bonferroni network using the entire time period .",
    "the number validated in each partition is shown in figure [ fig : fixed_t ] .",
    "we can thus safely conclude that decreasing the time horizon @xmath4 provides information independent of the increased time series length @xmath14 ."
