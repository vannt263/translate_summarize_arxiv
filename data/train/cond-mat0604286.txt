    "ceal@xmath0 ( ceal ) is a metallic system whose magnetic structure has been the object of some controversy for several years.@xcite initial studies@xcite indicated the existence of incommensurate long - range magnetic order on the ce ions with a single wavevector in the star of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 with @xmath10@xcite later@xcite it was proposed that this structure involved the simultaneous condensation of three wavevectors in the star of @xmath8 , but this suggestion of a  triple q \" structure was refuted in ref . .",
    "more recent work@xcite showed that the structure was in fact a  double q \" one in which exactly two wavevectors in the star of @xmath8 were simultaneously condensed .",
    "in addition , continued interest in ceal is due to its kondo - like behavior .",
    "initial indications of this came from the observation of a minimum in the resistivity at about 15k , which was attributed to spin compensation.@xcite a single impurity model , with a ce@xmath11 ion in a cubic crystal field interacting with the conduction band , was able to account for most of the electrical properties.@xcite moreover , when , in neutron experiments , no third order magnetic satellite appeared at low temperature , the kondo effect was invoked to explain why the moment of a kramers ion did not saturate in the zero - temperature limit.@xcite this objection is partially removed by the double - q structure.@xcite moreover , an analysis@xcite of multi - q states claims that the double - q structure can not be explained if ceal is regarded as an itinerant - electron magnet .",
    "in this paper we proceed under the assumption that although kondo effects may be present due to the coupling of the ce 4f electron to the conduction band , the magnetic structure can be understood in terms of interaction between localized moments on the ce ions .",
    "since the lattice structure is fcc , it is apparent that antiferromagnetic interactions between shells of near neighbors could compete and might then explain the incommensurability",
    ". however , no concrete calculations of this type have yet appeared .",
    "it is also interesting that this system does not follow the simplest scenario for incommensurate magnets,@xcite namely , as the temperature is lowered , a phase transition occurs in which a modulated phase appears with spins confined to an easy axis , and then , at a lower temperature a second phase transition occurs in which transverse order develops , so as to partially satisfy the fixed length spin constraint expected to progressively dominate as the temperature is lowered . instead",
    ", in ceal , there is no second phase transition , and in the ordered phase one has the simultaneous condensation of long - range order at two symmetry - related wavevectors.@xcite there are two aspects of this behavior that have not yet been explained .",
    "1 ) the incommensurate wavevector lies close to , but not exactly along the high symmetry @xmath12 direction and 2 ) although so - called `` triple - q '' systems are well known,@xcite in which the incommensurate ordered state consists of the simultaneous superposition of three wavevectors , it is unusual , in a cubic system , to have a `` double - q '' state@xcite consisting of the simultaneous superposition of exactly two wavevectors .",
    "the aim of this paper is to develop a model which can explain the above two puzzling features .",
    "we first address the determination of the incommensurate wavevector .",
    "some time ago , yamamoto and nagamiya@xcite ( yn ) studied the ground state of a simple fcc antiferromagnet with isotropic nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest neighbor ( nnn ) heisenberg interactions and found a rich phase diagram in terms of these interactions whose coupling constants we will denote here as @xmath6 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "we perform an equivalent calculation for a related model appropriate to ceal based on an analysis of the terms in the landau expansion of the free energy in the paramagnetic phase . by studying the instability of this quadratic form which occurs",
    "as the temperature is lowered , one can predict the magnetic structure of the ordered phase .",
    "in particular , one can thereby determine the wavevector at which this instability first occurs .",
    "this phenomenon is referred to as  wavevector selection . \"",
    "as nagamiya s review@xcite indicates , correct wavevector selection in ceal must require a model which involves competition between nn and further neighbor interactions .",
    "for the fcc structure of ceal the most convenient model which almost explains wavevector selection involves nn , nnn , and fourth - neighbor interactions . based on our insight developed from this model",
    ", we suggest the how more general interactions can completely explain wavevector selection .",
    "although we invoke more distant than nn interactions , the magnitudes of the further neighbor couplings needed to explain the nonsymmetric wavevector of ceal decrease with increasing separation and are reasonable , especially in view of the possibility of ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky)@xcite interactions in this metallic system . because our main interest lies in explaining wavevector selection , we have completely ignored anisotropy , whose major effect is to break rotational invariance and select spin orientations",
    "coincidentally we note several regions in parameter space for these models in which one has a multiphase point ( at which wavevector selection is incomplete ) .",
    "this phenomenon is perhaps most celebrated in the kagom@xcite and pyrochlore@xcite systems .",
    "based on these results we also point out that there are likewise regions of parameter space that could explain wavevector selection@xcite in the similar kondo - like system tms .",
    "the second stage of our calculation for ceal involves an analysis of the fourth order terms in the landau expansion , because it is these terms which dictate whether only one or more than one wavevector in the star of @xmath8 is simultaneously condensed to form the ordered phase . for this analysis",
    "there are two plausible ways to proceed .",
    "an oft - used approach@xcite is to determine the most general fourth order term allowed by symmetry and then see whether some choice of allowed parameters can explain a",
    " double q \" state .",
    "the virtue of this method is that it corresponds to the use of fluctuation - renormalized mean - field theory .",
    "a drawback , however , is that it is hard to know whether the allowed parameters are appropriate for the actual system .",
    "here we adopt a contrary procedure in which only the  bare \" ( unrenormalized ) fourth order terms are considered .",
    "obviously , these terms do have the correct symmetry , and although they might not be the most general possible terms , they do ensure that the values of the parameters are plausible .",
    "the organization of this paper follows the above plan . in sec .",
    "ii we extend the analysis of yn to fcc magnets with three shells of isotropic exchange interactions , but even this model only partially explains the wavevector selection seen in ceal . in sec .",
    "iii we invoke more distant interactions , whose existence is attributed to either rkky interactions,@xcite or indirect interactions via excited crystal field states , as discussed in appendix c. thereby we explain wavevector selection in ceal and also in the similar system tms . here",
    "we also use the observed ordering temperature and data for the zero wavevector susceptibility to estimate values of the dominant exchange interactions . in sec .",
    "iv we analyze the fourth order terms in the landau expansion and show that they naturally lead to the `` double - q '' state observed@xcite in ceal .",
    "our results are briefly summarized in sec .",
    "in isotropic heisenberg models of magnetic systems with only nearest neighbor ( nn ) interactions on , say , a simple cubic lattice , the magnetic structure of the ordered phase is trivially constructed if the sign of the interaction is known . in more complicated models",
    "it may happen that next - nearest neighbor ( nnn ) interactions compete with the nn interactions , in which case the magnetic structure may be an incommensurate one.@xcite in this case , the quadratic terms in landau free energy ( which we study below ) will be such that , as the temperature is lowered , the paramagnetic phase develops an instability , relative to the development of long - range magnetic order , at a wavevector @xmath8 ( or more properly , at the star of @xmath8 ) . for ceal our aim is to study this  wavevector selection , \" and explain how a model of exchange interactions can lead to the observed ordering wavevectors .    for this purpose ,",
    "this section is devoted to an analysis of the quadratic terms in the free energy which determine wavevector selection .",
    "we first note that the space group of ceal is fd@xmath14 m ( space group # 227 in ref . ) which is an fcc system with two ce atoms per fcc unit cell at locations @xmath15 this means that each ce ion has a tetrahedron of nn s and we will treat further neighbor interactions as in an fcc bravais lattice .",
    "note that the two sites at @xmath16 and @xmath17 are related by inversion symmetry relative to the point @xmath18 .",
    "we introduce the following simple model of exchange interactions , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the spin operator at @xmath21 . here",
    "we treat the model having three shell of interactions , so that the only nonzero @xmath6 s are @xmath22 in other words we have exchange couplings , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 between nn s , nnn s , and a shell of fourth - nearest neighbors ( fnn s ) , respectively , and these are shown in fig .",

    "our @xmath24 and @xmath25 correspond to yn s @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively and their simple fcc structure did not have a @xmath23 interaction .",
    "as will become apparent below , we include a fnn interaction rather than a third neighbor ( tnn ) interaction in the interest of algebraic simplicity .",
    "( color online ) exchange interactions for ceal , showing only the magnetic ce atoms in three ( 001 ) planes .",
    "the structure can be thought of as consisting of two interpenetrating fcc sublattices .",
    "the ce @xmath16 atoms are circles ( red online ) and the ce @xmath17 atoms are squares ( blue online ) . filled squares represent the four ce @xmath17 atoms which are nearest neighbors to the ce @xmath16 atom at the origin , indicated by a filled circle .",
    "the exchange constants between nn s , nnn s , third neighbors , and fourth neighbors are @xmath28 , @xmath6 , @xmath29 , and @xmath13 , respectively.,width=340 ]    the 4f electron of the ce ion has quantum numbers @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , so that @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the land @xmath35 factor.@xcite the crystal field then splits the six states of the @xmath36 manifold into a ground doublet and an excited quartet state at an excitation energy of about 100k in temperature units.@xcite this ground doublet can be described by an effective spin operator @xmath37 of magnitude 1/2 and within the doublet @xmath38 when admixtures from the quartet state are neglected . in that case",
    "@xmath39 when admixtures caused by the actual exchange field and also an applied field of 45 koe were calculated by barbara _",
    "et al._,@xcite the moment was found to be somewhat larger than that zero net field , but for zero applied field we neglect this effect .",
