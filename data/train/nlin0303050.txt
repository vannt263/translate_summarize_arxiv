    "one of the fundamental questions of quantum chaos is why , in the semiclassical limit , almost all classically hyperbolic systems display universal spectral fluctuations , only depending on their symmetries .",
    "this universality was initially conjectured by bohigas , giannoni and schmit @xcite and is by now supported by overwhelming experimental and numerical evidence @xcite .",
    "examples for experimental tests range from nuclear physics and atomic and molecular spectroscopy to classical microwave billiards studied in the limit of large wavenumbers . even though random - matrix theory provides a phenomenological description of these universal features ,",
    "a derivation from first principles is still lacking .",
    "also in other areas of research , such as mesoscopic quantum transport , the reasons for the amazing success of random - matrix theory are only beginning to emerge @xcite . to tackle this long - lasting challenge ,",
    "several approaches have been suggested such as parametric level dynamics @xcite or an extension of field theoretical methods used in the theory of disordered systems @xcite .    in the present paper , following an ansatz pioneered in @xcite , we relate quantum spectral statistics to the properties of classical periodic orbits .",
    "we treat the spectral form factor ( _ i.e. _ the fourier transform of the spectral two - point correlation function ) .",
    "according to random - matrix theory , it has the following form for systems belonging to the orthogonal universality class ( _ i.e. _ hyperbolic systems with no symmetries except a time - reversal symmetry whose time - reversal operator squares to unity ) @xmath0 here , @xmath1 is the time measured in units of the heisenberg time @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the average level density ) , and we are only considering the range @xmath4 . using gutzwiller s trace formula for the level density @xcite , the form factor can be expressed as a double sum over periodic orbits @xmath5 , @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the classical stability amplitude , @xmath9 the period and @xmath10 the maslov index of the periodic orbit @xmath5 ; the brackets @xmath11 denote averaging over the energy and over a small time window .",
    "note that as the semiclassical limit is taken for fixed @xmath12 , the period of the contributing orbits tends to infinity proportionally to @xmath13 .",
    "the crucial point is that the summand connected to each pair of orbits has a phase given by their action difference divided by @xmath14 .",
    "thus in the semiclassical limit , the phases will be randomly distributed and most terms will interfere destructively . a contribution to the form factor can only arise from pairs of orbits whose action difference is of the order of planck s constant .",
    "thus , there is a deep relation between correlations among the actions of _ classical periodic orbits _ and correlations in _ quantum spectra _ @xcite .",
    "first success in this direction was reported by berry @xcite , who derived the leading term @xmath15 in the series expansion of @xmath16 from pairs of orbits which are either identical or related by time reversal ( diagonal approximation ) . starting with results by argaman _",
    "@xcite , the search was on to identify further families of orbit pairs with similar action , expected to give rise to higher - order contributions to the form factor ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a breakthrough was recently achieved by sieber and richter , who proposed orbit pairs in which one of the orbits contains a self - crossing in configuration - space with a small angle @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "its partner narrowly avoids that crossing , approximately following one loop of the first orbit , and following the other loop in the time - reversed sense ( cp .",
    "[ fig : pair ] ) .",
    "the action difference between the two is quadratic in @xmath17 and thus can be arbitrarily small . since it is required that the time reversal of a classical orbit loop is again a classical orbit loop , such pairs of orbits can only exist in time - reversal invariant systems . using these pairs ,",
    "sieber and richter derived the leading off - diagonal contribution @xmath18 to the form factor for a uniformly hyperbolic billiard ( a billiard where all orbits have the same lyapunov exponent @xmath19 ) , the so - called hadamard - gutzwiller model , _",
    "i.e. _ geodesic motion on a tesselated surface of constant negative curvature of genus 2 .",
    "they summed over the contributions of all these pairs using two ingredients , the action difference between the two partners and the density of crossing angles .",
    "the @xmath20-term arises due to a correction to the latter of next - to - leading order in the orbit period .",
    "it stems from the fact that in the hadamard - gutzwiller model , a loop with a small crossing angle must have a minimal traversal time @xmath21 . in their derivation",
    "these authors made use of several system - specific niceties of the hadamard - gutzwiller model , which the form factor , being universal , can not depend on .",
    "first steps towards an extension to other systems have been taken for quantum graphs in @xcite , where both the @xmath20- and the @xmath22-contribution to the spectral form factor were shown to originate from similar orbit pairs .    in the present paper , extending results we first presented in @xcite , we go beyond these idealized models and derive the leading off - diagonal contribution to the form factor for general two - dimensional hyperbolic systems with a hamiltonian of the form @xmath23 .",
    "the main novel ideas needed to establish this universality are : + ( i ) the relation between the partner orbits can be formulated elegantly in terms of the invariant manifolds , which also determine the action difference within the orbit pair .",
    "+ ( ii ) the maslov indices of the partner orbits can be shown to coincide .",
    "+ ( iii ) in general systems , a logarithmic correction to the angle distribution arises involving the lyapunov exponent of the system ( as defined below ) .",
    "+ ( iv ) in systems with conjugate points , the one - to - one correspondence between crossings and orbit pairs is broken . there are crossings related to almost self - retracing loops without an associated partner orbit , and `` braids '' of crossings with a common partner .",
    "we show how to overcome these problems and reveal the distribution of crossings for which a partner orbit does exist as universal even in the presence of conjugate points .",
    "+ ( v ) the universal contribution to the form factor follows from a relation between the invariant manifolds and the lyapunov exponent .",
    "+ our findings are substantiated by numerical results for two billiard systems .",
    "note that the use of crossings in configuration space constitutes no conceptual problem _",
    "e.g. _ concerning canonical invariance , as what we are using is in fact the geometry of the invariant manifolds .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , it appears natural to work in configuration space since it is singled out by the conventional time - reversal operator .",
    "interestingly , the results of @xcite imply that our considerations immediately carry over to systems with non - conventional time - reversal invariance , as long as they can be canonically transformed to a hamiltonian of the above structure .",
    "an alternative approach avoiding a projection to configuration space will be presented in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first determine the action difference between the two partner orbits ( sect .",
    "2 ) and show that their maslov indices coincide ( sect .",
    "3 ) . in section 4",
    "we investigate the statistics of crossings angles , phase - space locations and loop times in systems without conjugate points . in section 5",
    "we generalize our findings to systems with conjugate points and clarify the relation between crossings and orbit pairs in such systems .",
    "finally , we will derive the @xmath20-contribution to the form factor in section 6 .",
    "a long periodic orbit typically has a huge number of self - crossings in configuration space . for a given small - angle self - crossing",
    ", we will show that a related orbit with similar action exists , provided the two orbit loops separated by the crossing are long .",
    "this partner orbit is obtained from the initial orbit by time reversal of one loop and a local deformation close to the crossing .",
    "further away , the deviation between the initial orbit ( respectively its time - reversed ) and the partner decays exponentially .",
    "as proposed in @xcite , the relation between these two orbits can be expressed elegantly in terms of stable and unstable manifolds .",
    "the main advantage of this method is that the action difference within the orbit pair can be shown to depend only on the crossing angle and the local behavior of the invariant manifolds at the phase - space location of the crossing .",
    "the complicated dependence on stability matrices of the two loops derived in @xcite is thus drastically simplified in the limit of long loops .",
    "recall that two phase - space points lie on each other s stable ( unstable ) manifold if trajectories starting from these points come infinitely close for @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) . for two - freedom systems , the local behavior of these invariant manifolds at a phase - space point",
    "@xmath26 can be characterized by just one number , called `` direction '' or `` curvature '' of the given manifold @xcite .",
    "this direction is defined as the ratio between the momentum and configuration - space components @xmath27 and @xmath28 of an infinitesimal phase - space deflection along the stable ( unstable ) manifold @xmath29 here , the deflection is assumed orthogonal to the trajectory passing through @xmath26 .",
    "note that time reversal @xmath30 exchanges stable and unstable manifolds and changes the sign of their directions such that @xmath31 .",
    "now , our condition of a local deformation can be formulated in terms of the invariant manifolds .",
    "let @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote the phase - space points corresponding to the two traversals of the crossing .",
    "on the partner orbit with time - reversed right loop , we single out a phase - space point @xmath34 , located where the perpendicular from the crossing hits that orbit ( see fig . [",
    "fig : pair ] ) .",
    "@xmath34 must approximately lie on the stable manifold of @xmath32 ( and vice versa ) , as trajectories starting there approach for a long time as @xmath24 .",
    "conversely , @xmath34 must lie on the unstable manifold of the time reversal of @xmath33 . to determine @xmath34",
    ", it is convenient to work in a poincar section @xmath35 defined by the above perpendicular .",
    "the coordinates of a phase - space point @xmath36 in that section will be denoted by @xmath37 .",
    "since @xmath38 must be stable and @xmath39 unstable , we obtain the following system of linear equations in @xmath40 , @xmath41 involving the directions of the invariant manifolds @xmath42 furthermore , we know that @xmath32 and @xmath33 coincide in configuration space , _ i.e. _ also @xmath43 , and that the difference in orthogonal momenta of @xmath32 and @xmath44 is related to the crossing angle by @xmath45 . using this , the solution to ( [ leq ] ) can be written as @xmath46 @xmath41 follows trivially .     and @xmath47 and two points half - way through the loops divide the orbit into four parts @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 . ]",
    "one can now expand the action of the orbit containing the crossing around that of its partner avoiding it .",
    "as the action of a periodic orbit is stationary , the first - order term vanishes .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the quadratic order in @xmath52 .",
    "we first consider the `` upper '' side of the crossing , _",
    "i.e. _ the orbit parts @xmath48 and @xmath49 separated by @xmath35 and two points half - way through the two loops as shown in figure [ fig : pair ] .",
    "the second derivatives of their action can be related to the stable and unstable directions .",
    "for example , @xmath53 generates the motion from the configuration - space point @xmath54 on @xmath35 to the point @xmath55 half - way through the left loop , thus @xmath56 and therefore @xmath57 .",
    "these derivatives are taken for constant @xmath55 , and can in the limit of long loops be approximated by derivatives along the stable manifold .",
    "we thus have @xmath58 and analogously @xmath59 the same reasoning can be repeated for the `` lower '' side of the crossing in a slightly different poincar section orthogonal to the `` lower '' part of the orbit in a phase - space point @xmath47 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pair ] ) .",
    "a taylor expansion now shows that avoiding a crossing with angle @xmath17 located at @xmath26 reduces the action by @xmath60 for small angles , we can neglect the difference of the stable resp .",
    "unstable directions at @xmath32 , @xmath34 , @xmath44 , and @xmath61 ( which we will denote collectively by @xmath26 ) , as long as @xmath62 and @xmath63 are sufficiently smooth close to the crossing location .",
    "this condition is usually fulfilled unless _ e.g. _ immediately after the crossing , the different branches of one loop enclose a singularity of the flow .",
    "apart from these exceptional cases , ( [ actiondiffsing ] ) simplifies to @xmath64 this may also be negative , meaning that the action can also be increased by avoiding the crossing . using that @xmath31 one easily sees that this result is invariant under time reversal of @xmath26 , as it should be , since we must obtain the same action difference if we insert for @xmath26 the other , almost time - reversed traversal of the crossing .",
    "assuringly , the action difference in the hadamard - gutzwiller model follows from ( [ actiondiff ] ) as a special case . in that model",
    "we have @xmath65 ( where @xmath66 is mass ) for all phase - space points @xmath26 , and thus @xmath67 in accordance with @xcite .",
    "the contribution of a pair of orbits to the form factor is determined not only by the difference of their actions , but also by the difference of their maslov indices .",
    "we want to show that for sieber - richter pairs of orbits , at least in the limit of small angles the latter vanishes .",
    "note that this was trivial in the hadamard - gutzwiller model , where all maslov indices are zero .",
    "we work in the framework of a beautiful geometric interpretation of the maslov index of a periodic orbit due to creagh _",
    "@xcite , again in a ( in the present context two - dimensional ) poincar section orthogonal to the orbit . here",
    ", the invariant manifolds locally have the form of lines through the origin which rotate around the origin as we move along the orbit .",
    "the maslov index now equals the net number of clockwise half - rotations of the stable or , equivalently , the unstable manifold ( _ i.e. _ the difference of the numbers of clockwise and counter - clockwise half - rotations ) .    for our argument",
    ", we also define the maslov index of a finite non - periodic orbit such as an orbit loop in sieber - richter theory .",
    "it is the sum of the net rotation angles of the stable and the unstable manifold around the origin , divided by @xmath68 .",
    "even though not canonically invariant , non - integer , and depending on the units chosen in the poincar section , this definition is very useful because it makes the maslov index of a loop invariant under time reversal .",
    "obviously , time reversal leaves the absolute value of a rotation angle invariant .",
    "the same is true for the sense of rotation , since time reversal inverts the motion on the poincar section in direction ( turning a clockwise rotation into a counter - clockwise one and vice versa ) , but also changes the sign of the momentum ( turning the sense of rotation back to the original one ) .",
    "an alternative analytic proof can be found in @xcite .",
    "in addition , time reversal exchanges the stable and unstable manifolds , which also can not affect the _ sum _ of their rotation angles . reassuringly , this newly defined maslov index coincides with the usual one in case the orbit happens to be periodic .",
    "moreover , it is additive for subsequent orbit pieces and smooth under small deformations of the orbit as long as the invariant manifolds are smooth .",
    "we can now show that the maslov indices of the two partner orbits coincide .",
    "they can be expressed as sums over the maslov indices of the two loops .",
    "due to additivity and time - reversal invariance of the loop maslov indices , formal time reversal of one loop leaves the maslov index of the orbit invariant . in the limit of small crossing angles , any subsequent local deformation as described in section 2 can at most lead to a small change of the maslov indices of the loops .",
    "since , however , the maslov index of a periodic orbit is an integer quantity , the maslov indices of the two partners have to coincide .",
    "we have seen that in non - uniformly hyperbolic systems the action difference within a sieber - richter pair of orbits depends both on the angle and on the phase - space location of the crossing . anticipating that like in the hadamard - gutzwiller model , also the traversal times of the loops",
    "play a crucial role , we investigate the density @xmath69 of loops with crossing angle @xmath17 , time @xmath70 , and initial phase - space point @xmath26 ( the latter being one of the two traversal points of the crossing ) in a periodic orbit of period @xmath71 .",
    "this density is normalized in such a way that integration over all possible values of @xmath26 , @xmath17 , and @xmath70 yields the average number of loops , and thus twice the average number of crossings , in a periodic orbit of period close to @xmath71 . to make our exposition more clear , in the present section we will still limit ourselves to systems without conjugate points ; our findings will be generalized to systems with conjugate points in section 5 .    from the ergodicity of the flow we can , along the lines of @xcite ,",
    "deduce the following approximation @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the volume of the energy shell .",
    "the proportionality to @xmath74 reflects the fact that orthogonal parts of the orbit intersect more frequently than almost parallel or antiparallel ones .    however , like in the hadamard - gutzwiller model there is a correction to that ergodic prediction because loop times below a certain angle and location dependent minimum are impossible",
    ". we will first give a general argument why this minimal loop time is generic , and later substantiate our point by numerical evidence for billiards and discuss certain system - specific limitations .",
    "in systems without conjugate points , two trajectories starting from the same point in configuration space with a small opening angle can not gather in another point as long as the phase - space separation between them can be approximated as a linear function of the initial separation .",
    "for an orbit loop to close it is thus necessary that , during half the loop time the separation between one of its two branches and the time - reversed of the other branch grows far enough to make that approximation invalid . apart from exceptional cases to be discussed later",
    ", this typically means that their separation must reach a classical phase - space scale of the order of some finite fraction of the maximal phase - space separation . if the branches enclose a small crossing angle @xmath17 , this requires the loop to be long .",
    "let @xmath75 denote the phase - space separation between one branch of the loop and the time - reversed of the other one in an arbitrary norm @xmath76 at the location of the crossing ( thus @xmath77 ) and @xmath78 the separation after half the loop time .",
    "as long as the linearized approximation is applicable both are for large @xmath70 related by @xmath79 where @xmath19 is the lyapunov exponent of the system .",
    "this asymptotic behavior is due to the fact that long loops ergodically explore the whole energy shell .",
    "the lyapunov exponent governing the asymptotic fate of a small deviation @xmath80 ( with non - vanishing unstable component ) at a phase - space point @xmath26 coincides for almost all @xmath26 , since it can be expressed as the average of the so - called local stretching rate over an infinite trajectory starting at @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "thus , in case of an ergodic flow it coincides with a phase - space average almost everywhere ( except _ e.g. _ on periodic orbits ) .",
    "note that due to pesin s theorem , @xmath19 also coincides with the kolmogorov - sinai entropy @xcite . in uniformly hyperbolic systems",
    "such averaging is trivial since the local stretching rate is constant and therefore even the lyapunov exponents of periodic orbits coincide .",
    "demanding that the deviation @xmath81 reaches the limit for a breakdown of the linear approximation just after half the loop time , we obtain a minimal loop time of @xmath82 here , @xmath83 is constant with respect to the angle but may depend on the phase - space point @xmath26 immediately preceding the loop .",
    "however , the exact value of @xmath83 will turn out to be irrelevant for the form factor .",
    "the second loop starts approximately at @xmath84 , thus its time must fulfill @xmath85 . incorporating these minimal loop times in a straight - forward way , we obtain the following density of loops @xmath86 integration over @xmath87 yields the density of crossing angles and phase - space locations@xmath88    we want to clearly point out the scope of our approximation .",
    "first , the minimal loop time derived above gives the threshold after which loops have a _ chance _ to close , but does not predict the exact behavior of the shortest loops . thus in the immediate vicinity of the minimal loop time , system specific structures appear which are not described by ( [ angledist ] ) and ( [ angle ] ) .",
    "second , we will see that singularities can let the linear approximation for the separation between the branches of a loop break down even before a typical phase - space scale is reached ( as also discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , singularities give rise to exceptional , system - specific crossings which may ignore the minimal loop time @xcite .    for our numerics",
    ", we are also interested in the statistics of self - crossings of non - periodic orbits . in full analogy to the above considerations for periodic orbits , we can show that the density of loops with crossing angle @xmath17 , time @xmath70 , and initial phase - space point @xmath26 in non - periodic orbits with traversal time @xmath71 reads @xmath89 integration yields the density of crossing angles and phase - space locations @xmath90      we will now present numerical evidence for this crossing distribution for a special billiard system , the desymmetrized diamond billiard ( see fig . [",
    "fig : diamsing ] ) .",
    "it can be regarded as the empty space between four overlapping disks @xcite  la sinai , cut into eight equal pieces .",
    "the distance between the disks is chosen as one , and we choose their radius @xmath91 so that its interior angles become @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the desymmetrized diamond billiard is non - uniformly hyperbolic and belongs to the class of semi - dispersing billiards ( _ i.e. _ it is surrounded by a boundary which consists of locally concave and straight segments ) .",
    "therefore , it is free of conjugate points .",
    "it has a circumference @xmath95 and an area @xmath96 .",
    "santal s formula @xcite gives its mean free path as @xmath97 . by averaging over the lyapunov exponents of random non - periodic trajectories ,",
    "we numerically obtain the lyapunov exponent of the system as @xmath98 .",
    "a few words are in order about our numerical technique .",
    "the crossing statistics is determined by averaging over @xmath99 non - periodic trajectories of length @xmath100 ( _ i.e. _ very long orbits compared to the typical length scales @xmath101 and @xmath102 ) with random initial conditions .",
    "for the delicate statistics of angles @xmath103 , even @xmath104 trajectories were considered .",
    "note that for billiards , it is useful to work in dimensionless coordinates with mass and velocity equal to one ; then the traversal time @xmath71 of each orbit equals @xmath105 , and the same holds true for the the traversal times @xmath70 and lengths @xmath106 of the loops .",
    "we now turn to our results . for small angles ,",
    "the basic idea of a minimal loop time depending logarithmitically on the crossing angle can be verified at a glance at figure [ fig : diama]a .",
    "here we have plotted the density of angles and loop times ( up to @xmath107 ) of crossings occurring anywhere on the energy shell trajectories . ] , and for convenience divided out the term @xmath74 arising from the ergodic approximation . sufficiently far above that logarithmic threshold , marked by a dashed line in figure [ fig : diama]a ,",
    "this density is almost uniform . in agreement with ( [ np1 ] )",
    ", it decays linearly towards larger loop time .",
    "note that according to ( [ minloop ] ) , the minimal loop time weakly depends on the location on the energy shell due to the factor @xmath83 .",
    "thus , the minimum in figure [ fig : diama]a is slightly smeared out . below the dashed line ,",

    ", we observe a threshold logarithmic in @xmath17 , as indicated by a dashed line.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in addition to this expected behavior , a rich variety of system - specific structures are seen .",
    "as announced , the crossing density shows system - specific inhomogeneities in the immediate vicinity of the minimal loop time .",
    "in addition , below the minimal loop time , we observe exceptional crossings related to singularities of the flow , most importantly the tangential singularity .",
    "namely , the linear approximation for the separation between the two branches of a loop is already violated if one branch reflects _",
    "e.g. _ at the circular part of the boundary , and the other branch narrowly avoids the circle . in this case , the separation between the branches of the loop need not reach a typical phase space scale for the loop to close .",
    "an example for such exceptional loops ignoring the minimal loop time is shown in figure [ fig : diamsing ] . however , our numerical results indicate that their effect on the crossing distribution is minute .    at larger angles , which in the semiclassical limit give no contribution to the form factor ,",
    "further structures are seen ( cp .",
    "[ fig : diama]b ) , such as + ( i ) discrete lines at @xmath111 corresponding to periodic orbits , which are nothing but loops with a `` crossing angle '' @xmath112 .",
    "they are deformed and broadened when going to smaller angles .",
    "thus , most loops close to the minimal time are obtained by deformation of the shortest periodic orbits .",
    "+ ( ii ) four families of loops which start at zero loop time , and as shown in @xcite are close to corners",
    ". one of these families of loops involves only reflections at the two straight - line segments of the boundary and has a crossing angle of @xmath92 for all its members .",
    "note that most of these structures were absent in the idealized example of the hadamard - gutzwiller model . in that model ,",
    "the analog of figure [ fig : diama ] just consists of dispersionless logarithmic curves corresponding each to the family of loops obtained by deformation of one periodic orbit @xcite .    further evidence for the minimal loop time is shown in figure [ fig : l10 ] , this time also taking into account the phase - space dependence of the crossing statistics .",
    "we restrict ourselves to crossings which have angles smaller than a maximal angle @xmath113 and take place inside a bin whose area is @xmath114 of the total energy shell , and consider the density of their loop times @xmath70 .",
    "this density must have a gap for small @xmath70 whose width is given by the minimal loop time and thus increases logarithmitically when @xmath113 is reduced .",
    "incidentally , this density of loop times can be shown to decay linearly for large @xmath70 in the case of non - periodic orbits .",
    "our numerical results confirm these predictions and again reveal system - specific structures close to the minimal loop time .",
    "the angle density @xmath115 ( averaged over the whole energy shell and over bins with sizes of @xmath114 and @xmath116 of the energy shell ) agrees with our predictions as well ( cp . fig .",
    "[ fig : angle ] ) .",
    "for sufficiently small angles , the distribution is sinusoidal . upon division by @xmath74 ,",
    "in accordance with ( [ pnp ] ) a logarithmic correction due to the minimal loop time becomes visible .",
    "the relative weight of that correction ( seen as the slope in the logarithmic plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle]b ) coincides for all three samples .",
    "we thus see that indeed the crossing distribution in a billiard is homogeneous on the energy shell apart from system - specific oscillations for large @xmath17 and apart from the factor @xmath83 .",
    "based on the relative weight of the logarithm , fitting yields a minimal loop time @xmath117 where @xmath118 agrees perfectly with the lyapunov exponent @xmath19 .        in this appendix , we want to show that in the cardioid billiard , the minimal loop time is ignored by a system - specific class of crossings related to the singularity at the cusp .",
    "we will argue that for the evaluation of the form factor , these crossings have to be disregarded as well .",
    "an example for these crossings is shown in figure ( [ fig : plot ] ) .",
    "for one of the two loops separated by the crossing , the two branches stay very near until being reflected on opposite sides of the cusp .",
    "thus , the linear approximation for the separation between these branches breaks down before their separation reaches a typical phase - space scale .",
    "then , in many cases , the loop closes by going around the boundary like in a whispering gallery .",
    "the length ( and thus time ) of the shortest such loops is approximately given by the circumference of the billiard .",
    "in fact , they can be seen as deformations of finite orbits starting and ending at the cusp as introduced in @xcite . in spite of their short time",
    ", the crossing angle can be arbitrarily small .",
    "so for these special loops , there is no minimal time depending logarithmitically on the angle .",
    "however , they do give rise to pairs of orbits with similar action , as their symbol sequences are not time - reversal invariant . nevertheless , we have to disregard these crossings for a semiclassical evaluation of the form factor , as even the validity of the gutzwiller formula for orbits coming so close to the cusp is questionable . in general , each time a periodic orbit comes closer to the boundary of a billiard than some length scale of the order of planck length , so - called penumbra corrections to the trace formula play an important role , as shown in @xcite for dispersing billiards .",
    "the breakdown of the trace formula for families of orbits approaching the cusp of the cardioid is discussed in @xcite .    due to these problems",
    ", we have to distinguish in our numerics between generic and cusp - related crossings .",
    "this distinction is done based on symbolic dynamics ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig : plot ] ) .",
    "the loop parts preceding the cusp are almost time - reversed with respect to each other and thus have symbol sequences @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "in contrast , the part following the cusp is almost symmetric with respect to the symmetry line of the cardioid , _",
    "i.e. _ its symbol sequence @xmath126 has to be invariant under inverting the ordering of symbols @xcite .",
    "usually , it undergoes a series of subsequent either clockwise or counter - clockwise reflections at the boundary , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath126 just consists of several identical symbols @xmath127 or @xmath128 .",
    "in addition , for the symbols between @xmath124 , @xmath126 and @xmath125 one has to take into account the effect of one branch being reflected close to the cusp and the other one narrowly avoiding it .",
    "these symbols can be read off from the example shown in figure [ fig : plot ] .",
    "thus , we see that cusp - related crossings have symbol sequences of the form @xmath129 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is arbitrary and @xmath126 invariant under inverting the ordering of symbols .",

    "<S> we reason in support of the universality of quantum spectral fluctuations in chaotic systems , starting from the pioneering work of sieber and richter who expressed the spectral form factor in terms of pairs of periodic orbits with self - crossings and avoided crossings . dropping the restriction to uniformly hyperbolic dynamics , we show that for general hyperbolic two - freedom systems with time - reversal invariance the spectral form factor is faithful to random - matrix theory , up to quadratic order in time . </S>",
    "<S> we relate the action difference within the contributing pairs of orbits to properties of stable and unstable manifolds . in studying the effects of conjugate points , we show that almost self - retracing orbit loops do not contribute to the form factor . </S>",
