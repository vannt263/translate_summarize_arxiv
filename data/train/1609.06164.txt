    "the finite - speed - of - light ( fsl ) effect has been studied by other research groups , and they gave different results.@xcite in this article , we present an analytical relativistic study method to recalculate this effect .",
    "in an atom - gravimeter system , the total phase shift can be written as the sum of three components : @xmath0.@xcite for calculating the propagation phase shift @xmath1 , one should first perform integrals of the lagrangian along the upper and lower paths over time to obtain the actions , and then take the difference between them . when one considers that the speed of light is finite , the calculation is complex , since the integral intervals for the two paths are different ( see fig .  1 left ) . to simplify the calculation",
    ", we propose analyzing the system in a new coordinate system , where the integral intervals can be synchronized . then , taking the first pulse separation for example , the difference between the actions for the two paths will undergo the change below : @xmath2 which can save a lot of unnecessary calculation .",
    "thus , the crucial step for our method is making a coordinate transformation for the laser beam .",
    "we assume light @xmath3 is the one reflected by the mirror in the bottom of the experimental setup . based on the analysis in ref .",
    ", light @xmath3 determines the change of the atom s state , and it can be considered as the `` control light . ''",
    "first , we should solve the geodesic equation of the photon to derive its trajectory @xmath4 , and then make a coordinate transformation for light @xmath3 : @xmath5 \\vec{z } { } ' =   \\vec{z}. \\end{array}\\right .",
    "\\label{aba : eq2}\\ ] ] after this transformation , the coordinate velocity of @xmath3 undergoes the change @xmath6 ( see fig .  1 right ) , and the lagrangian @xmath7 of the atom can be written as the sum of a quadratic part and a nonquadratic part : @xmath8 . thus , the propagation phase shift can be further expressed as : @xmath9",
    "for @xmath11 , one can calculate it by combining the bord abcd matrix method with quantum mechanics , which was previously studied in ref .",
    ": first derive the quadratic hamiltonian through the quadratic lagrangian , and further solve the motion equation of the atoms , and finally insert them into the action of the atoms ( in the abcd matrix form ) to get the related phase shift .    for @xmath12",
    ", one can refer to ref .",
    ": treat @xmath13 as a perturbation for @xmath14 , and use the perturbation approach to calculate the phase shift .    for @xmath15 , the frequency chirps should be taken into consideration .",
    "taking light @xmath3 , for example , one can simply introduce the phase as : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the frequency chirp for light @xmath3 .",
    "then , combining the interaction between the atoms and the raman light field , one can obtain the phase shift introduced by the laser beams .",
    "consequently , through summing the phase shifts analyzed above , one can derive the total phase shift and further the measured acceleration due to gravity , which can be kept to some high - order terms including some general relativistic effects .",
    "considering only the fsl correction , the measured @xmath10 can be written as : @xmath18 with @xmath19 the atom velocity at the @xmath20 pulse , and @xmath17 and @xmath21 the frequency chirps for the two raman beams .",
    "this analytical study method can be used to calculate the relativistic effects and present an analytical derivation process . from the result",
    ", one can separate the fsl effect and obtain a more complete expression for the fsl correction .",
