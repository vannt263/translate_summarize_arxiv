    "magnetic reconnection is one of the most important processes in many plasma systems .",
    "it drives various explosive events such as solar flares , substorms in the earth s magnetosphere , and disruptions in laboratory devices .",
    "it is well known that the reconnection process is crucially influenced by the dissipation physics near the reconnection point ( x - point ) .",
    "the structure of the dissipation region as well as the accommodated physics is of critical importance for the understanding of the reconnection mechanism .",
    "significant efforts have been made on this subject by theories , numerical simulations , and in situ satellite observations .    in a collisionless kinetic plasma , typically at a distance of the ion inertial length from the x - point , ions decouple from magnetic field lines while electrons remain magnetized . as a consequence ,",
    "hall physics plays a role inside the ion - decoupling region .",
    "signatures of hall physics such as quadruple magnetic field , bipolar normal electric field , and the relevant current loops @xcite were confirmed by in situ observations in the terrestrial magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "deep inside the ion - decoupling region , there is a thin layer where electrons depart from field lines .",
    "a compact dissipation region is located in a close vicinity of the x - point .",
    "in addition , recent simulation works suggest that narrow electron jets extend from there , stretching the nonideal layer in the outflow directions @xcite .",
    "these signatures were recently confirmed by satellite observations .",
    "@xcite found a compact region with an intense cross - tail current and neighboring electron jets at a super - alfvnic speed in a magnetotail reconnection event .    until recently it was not clear how to identify the dissipation region inside the electron nonideal layer . taking the energy transfer into account ,",
    "@xcite have proposed a general measure of the dissipation region . using particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations , they distinguished the dissipation region from the outer electron jet , which turned out to be an oblique projection of a non - dissipative current sheet @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we show in situ observational evidence for the dissipation region in a magnetotail reconnection event .",
    "on 15 may 2003 , geotail detected a reconnection event in the premidnight tail .",
    "this event was extensively analyzed by @xcite and so we only repeat important features here .",
    "figure [ fig : geotail ] shows key properties from 1053:00 ut to 1058:30 ut on 15 may 2003 .",
    "all data are presented in the spacecraft ( sc ) coordinates , because the electric field data are available only in the sc coordinates . during the period of our interest ,",
    "the sc coordinates are virtually the same as the gse and gsm coordinates . the rotation angle to the gse coordinates is less than @xmath5 and",
    "the angle to the gsm is less than @xmath6 .",
    "the satellite position was @xmath7 at 1056 ut .",
    "figure [ fig : geotail]a shows magnetic field @xmath8 at 16 hz , measured from the magnetic field experiment ( mgf ) @xcite .",
    "it suddenly turned from southward ( @xmath9 ) to northward ( @xmath10 ) at 1055:44 ut , as indicated by the red dotted lines . judging from this and many other signatures @xcite , geotail encountered a potential x - point ( hereafter x - point ) at this time .",
    "other quantities are shown at 12 s time resolution .",
    "figure [ fig : geotail]b shows electric field data , obtained from the electric field detector ( efd ) @xcite .",
    "technically , they were measured every 3 s and then averaged over 12 s. we note that the average electric field during 1057:45  1057:58 ut ( the arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : geotail]b ) is represented by one during 1057:45  1057:52 ut , because efd had violent , high - frequency noises of @xmath11 during 1057:52  1057:58 ut .",
    "one can see that @xmath12 has a bipolar signature across the x - point .",
    "this is a well - known signature of kinetic reconnection ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "figures [ fig : geotail]c and [ fig : geotail]d show the ion and electron bulk velocities .",
    "plasma moments are calculated from distribution functions that are measured by the low - energy particle experiment ( lep ) @xcite . due to the low time - resolution of 12",
    "s , these moments contain field - aligned flows along the separatrices from 1055:30 ut to 1057:00 ut .",
    "to rule out the field - aligned hall currents , transverse velocities are presented ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the @xmath14 is distinctly fast near the x - point ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geotail]d ) .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : geotail]c , both @xmath15 and @xmath16 change their signs across the x - point .",
    "note that @xmath16 overshoots @xmath15 on both two sides of the x - point .",
    "the outward electron velocity is even faster than the typical upstream alfvn velocity . the upstream magnetic field",
    "( @xmath17 nt ) and density ( @xmath18 ) give @xmath19 km / s .",
    "such bi - directional , super - alfvnic electron jets are consistent with previous simulations @xcite .",
    "the shadows indicate a characteristic interval from 1055:07 to 1056:44 ut , surrounded by sudden spikes in @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geotail]a ) .",
    "this interval features super - alfvnic electron jets ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geotail]c ) , an intense duskward electron flow ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geotail]d ) , and a low plasma density ( not shown ) .",
    "@xcite referred to this interval as the `` ion - electron decoupling time . ''",
    "[ fig : geotail ]    next we introduce several measures to discuss the reconnection region from geotail data .",
    "we consider the energy transfer in the rest frame of the electron s bulk flow .",
    "this measure , the electron - frame dissipation measure @xmath20 , is formally defined in eq . ( 7 ) in @xcite . in a nonrelativistic neutral plasma , it can be reduced to @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the nonideal electric field and @xmath23 is the work rate per unit volume by the lorentz force to the ion fluid or the electron fluid . since this lorentz work @xmath4 ( /sec /unit volume ) stands for the energy transfer in the ideal mhd , equation [ eq : edr2 ] reads the total energy transfer minus the ideal transfer , i.e. , the _ nonideal _ energy transfer from fields to plasmas @xcite .",
    "we further assume @xmath24 to obtain the following approximate form , @xmath25 the two measures @xmath26 and @xmath4 are shown in figure [ fig : dissipation ] .",
    "the current density is directly calculated from the plasma moments , @xmath27 .",
    "the dissipation @xmath26 ( gray histogram ) has a peak near the x - point .",
    "its peak rates are 39 and 45 @xmath28 during 1055:32  1055:44 ut and 1055:44  1055:56 ut ( two 12 s intervals ) , respectively .",
    "the lorentz work @xmath4 ( dashed histogram ) has a peak during 1054:311054:43 ut .",
    "we validate our observations with a 2d pic simulation @xcite .",
    "we employ a harris - like initial model , @xmath29 and @xmath30 $ ] , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the reference magnetic field and density .",
    "the current sheet thickness is set to @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the ion inertial length .",
    "other simulation parameters are @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 cells with @xmath39 particles .",
    "the computational domain is @xmath40\\times[-19.2 , 19.2]$ ] in units of @xmath34 with periodic ( @xmath41 ) and reflecting ( @xmath42 ) boundaries .",
    "velocities are normalized by the typical alfvn velocity @xmath43 .",
    "figure [ fig : snapshot ] shows snapshots in the well - developed stage . in this case , judging from the sign of @xmath20 , the dissipation region is located around @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "its thickness is limited by that of an electron current layer .",
    "the layer thickness is comparable with the local electron inertial length , @xmath46 .",
    "there are also weak dissipative regions at @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where the magnetic field lines suddenly flip .",
    "surprisingly , both @xmath20 and @xmath26 give almost identidal pictures , as shown in figures [ fig : snapshot]a and [ fig : snapshot]b .",
    "there are minor differences near the vertical dissipative regions but it is hard to recognize them in the figures .",
    "figure [ fig : snapshot]c presents plasma outflow velocities along the outflow line ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the electron jet substantially overruns the ion flow @xcite until it reaches a shock - like transition region at @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the electrons are magnetized further downstream .",
    "note that @xmath52 and @xmath53 are still different in the downstream , because the ions remain unmagnetized .",
    "figures [ fig : snapshot]d shows the dissipation measure @xmath20 and the lorentz work @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath20 measure is almost identical to @xmath26 along the outflow line , where @xmath54 .",
    "outside the central dissipation region , @xmath20 exhibits a weak undershoot in the downstream , indicating energy transfer from plasmas to the electromagnetic fields in the comoving frame of plasmas .",
    "this is a signature of the fast electron jet region @xcite . the lorentz work @xmath4 is usually positive over the reconnection region , because the lorentz force continuously drives plasmas in the outflow directions .",
    "further downstream , it has a local peak at @xmath55 ( outside the domain in fig .",
    "3 ) , where the reconnected flux ( @xmath8 ) hits the initial current sheet .",
    "[ fig : dissipation ]",
    "let us examine the validity of the approximate measure ( eq . [ eq : d ] ) . since efd does not measure @xmath56 along the spin axis , we have to reconstruct @xmath56 in equation [ eq : edr2 ] .",
    "we consider the following three ways .",
    "( 1 ) a popular way is to assume @xmath57 .",
    "however , since there are strong parallel electric field near the dissipation region , @xmath58 @xcite , and since @xmath8 is usually weak , this does not work .",
    "( 2 ) the second is to assume @xmath59 .",
    "this gives a different picture that emphasizes separatrices .",
    "physically , this assumption drops the energy transfer @xmath60 but leave the ideal part @xmath61 in equation [ eq : edr2 ] . in other words ,",
    "the ideal part contaminates the nonideal dissipation measure @xmath20 .",
    "thus we should not assume @xmath59 .",
    "( 3 ) the third is to set @xmath62 .",
    "this is our choice . despite strong hall electric field @xmath56 near the dissipation region @xcite",
    ", the @xmath63 condition is fairly satisfied outside the electron current layer , and so @xmath64 is a minor contributor to @xmath20 along the inflow line ( see fig .",
    "5a in @xcite ) .",
    "the ideal condition is also violated @xmath65 along the separatrices but this does not involve significant energy transfer . in general , @xmath64 is negligible due to weak @xmath66 .",
    "thus @xmath26 approximates @xmath20 quite well .",
    "note that this choice is specific to a magnetotail configuration without a guide field .",
    "in other configurations @xmath64 could be important and equation [ eq : d ] may not be useful .    in figure [",
    "fig : dissipation ] , the @xmath0 measure has a peak near the x - point during 1055:44  1056:08 ut .",
    "this is evident for the dissipation region .",
    "let us evaluate the dissipation rate .",
    "the reconnection electric field @xmath67 is fairly uniform over the reconnection region , except for the magnetic pile - up region near the outflow jet front . from pic simulations",
    ", we empirically know that the reconnection rate remains constant , @xmath68 . here ,",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 are the magnetic field and the alfvn velocity in an upstream region , typically a few @xmath34 upstream from the x - point .",
    "it is empirically known that the half width of the electron current layer is approximated by the local electron inertial length @xmath71 up to the case of a realistic mass ratio @xcite .",
    "the current density inside the dissipation region is @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the magnetic field at the upstream edge of the dissipation region .",
    "after the initial current sheet plasma moves out , the plasma density is roughly uniform over the reconnection region .",
    "assuming a uniform density , one can estimate typical dissipation at the x - point , @xmath74 from simulations , we know that the upstream magnetic field is typically a half of the asymptotic lobe field : @xmath75 . in this event , the lobe field is estimated to @xmath76 nt , while @xmath77 occasionally hits 10 nt near the separatricies .",
    "thus , it would be reasonable to assume @xmath78 nt .",
    "meanwhile , it is very difficult to estimate @xmath73 , because the electron - scale dissipation region is embedded in a thick reconnection layer of the order of the ion meandering width . from simulation",
    "we obtain @xmath79 . however , this ratio could be smaller in a real system , because the electron skin depth with @xmath80 is 4.3 times smaller than one with @xmath35 . using @xmath78 nt and @xmath81",
    ", we obtain @xmath82 @xmath83 .",
    "in addition , our data are averaged over a time interval of 12 s. geotail resolves the spatial structure rather coarsely .",
    "using spatially averaged quantities , their product @xmath26 could be underestimated by a factor of two or three . considering this , the observed rates , @xmath84 and @xmath85 @xmath83 ( 1055:44  1056:08 ut ) , are reasonable .",
    "it is difficult to evaluate unambiguously the size of the dissipation region in our single - satellite observation .",
    "@xcite predicted that the half length of the @xmath86 region is @xmath87 . in many",
    "@xmath88 runs [ a. klimas , private communication ] and in our @xmath35 run , the dissipation region is twice longer than the @xmath86 region .",
    "thus the full length of the dissipation region will be @xmath89 .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite reported that the aspect ratio of the dissipation region is @xmath90 .",
    "given that the half width of the dissipation region is @xmath91 , the full length will be @xmath92 . in these cases ,",
    "the full extent of the dissipation region will be @xmath93 examining several clues such as the upstream distribution functions , @xcite estimated that the entire structure retreats at @xmath94 km / s . the above two estimates are comparable with the spatial scale of one or two sampling intervals ( 1224 s ) , 12002400 km .",
    "geotail detected the dissipation region by two or three sampling intervals ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dissipation ] ) , 24003600 km or @xmath95@xmath96 or @xmath2@xmath3 .",
    "the length of the dissipation region is on the same order .",
    "the characteristic interval from 1055:07 to 1056:44 ut ( the shadow regions in figs .",
    "[ fig : geotail ] and [ fig : dissipation ] ) would correspond to the full extent of the outer electron jet region in the pic simulation ( @xmath97 in fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshot ] ) .",
    "one can recognize the magnetic field fluctuations in figure [ fig : geotail]a ( indicated by arrows ) .",
    "it is likely that the fluctuations originate from the electron jet front region at @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshot ] ) , where the fast electron jet hits the outer plasma outflow . in observation , @xmath26 is negative before the central dissipation region arrives ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dissipation ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the weak undershoot of @xmath20 in the electron jet region in the pic simulation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshot ] ) .",
    "we do not recognize a similar undershoot on the other side ( 1055:44  1056:44 ut ) .",
    "this is because the geotail was near the separatrix , outside the central electron jet region @xcite .",
    "it is not surprising that @xmath100 still differs from @xmath101 outside the interval ( figs .",
    "[ fig : geotail]c and [ fig : geotail]d ) .",
    "electrons are magnetized there , but ions remain unmagnetized downstream of the electron jet fronts .",
    "reconnection outflow recovers the ideal mhd approximation when ions are magnetized further downstream , but the transition to the mhd region could be ambiguous .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : dissipation ] , the lorentz work @xmath4 is usually positive over the reconnection region .",
    "this signature is consistent with the pic simulation ( section 3 ) .",
    "one can recognize a peak during 10541055 ut .",
    "we find that @xmath8 is compressed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geotail]a ) in this interval and that the plasma density decreased after the @xmath4-region arrived ( see fig .",
    "1j in @xcite ) .",
    "this @xmath4-region appears to be a magnetic pile - up region behind a tangential discontinuity , where the compressed @xmath8 pushes the dense plasma sheet outward .",
    "we do not recognize similar @xmath4-region on the other side of 10571058 ut , because the satellite was not in the central neutral plane .",
    "in fact , we find similar @xmath4-regions associated with the pile - up regions in other reconnection events .",
    "the @xmath4 measure in reconnection deserves further investigation by theories , simulations , and observations .    to our knowledge , this is the first identification of the dissipation region in magnetotail reconnection .",
    "earlier observations focused on large - scale signatures of the reconnection site , such as the flow reversal or hall fields . in the 15 may 2003 event , geotail fortunately resolved a small - scale signatures of bi - directional electron jets @xcite and then the present work finally detected a compact dissipation region between the jets . although our resolution is quite limited , this is the best possible measurement with the present instruments .",
    "in addition , this work is a step forward for reconnection theories .",
    "the dissipation measure theory @xcite was only tested by 2d pic simulations with artificial mass ratio .",
    "here we showed that the theory works in the complex real world .",
    "the theory appears to be practically useful .",
    "we analyzed geotail reconnection event on 15 may 2003 .",
    "we applied the electron - frame dissipation measure @xmath102 to the reconnection structure . using @xmath0 , for the first time",
    ", we identified the dissipation region around the possible x - point in nature .",
    "the dissipation rate ( @xmath1 ) and the length of the dissipation region ( 12@xmath103 ) are reasonable .",
    "we introduced the lorentz work @xmath4 as well .",
    "the two measures are useful for better understanding of the reconnection structure",
    ".    our approach will be applicable to next - generation in situ observations .",
    "nasa s upcoming magnetospheric multiscale ( mms ) mission features high temporal resolution , multi - satellite observation , and measurement of all three components of the electric field .",
    "we will be able to see clearer pictures of the dissipation region .",
