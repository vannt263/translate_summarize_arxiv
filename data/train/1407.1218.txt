    "[ sec : axinolsp ] , the produced higgsinos dominantly and promptly decay to the bino nlsp .",
    "it is more obviously true here because the decays between higgsinos and binos are not small - gap - suppressed .",
    "then , again all the higgsino productions essentially lead to abundant bino pair productions in the collider physics point of view .",
    "binos can also decay to the axino lsp with substantial lifetime . in fig .",
    "[ fig : width - bino ] , we show the proper decay length of bino nlsps . in the majority of relevant parameter space , binos likely decay inside detector either promptly or with dvs .",
    "compared to the higgsino nlsp s decay in fig .",
    "[ fig : width - higgsino ] , binos have a somewhat longer lifetime because binos couple to axinos via higgsino mixtures in the dfsz model .",
    "numerically , it turns out that the bino typically has a 35 times longer lifetime ( with the same other parameters ) which implies that about 2 times lower @xmath2 scale is needed for a similar lifetime . if higgsinos are much heavier , the bino decays are much slower with about 1020 times longer lifetime due to a smaller bino - higgsino mixing .     for the given parameter space of the higgsino nnlsp , bino nlsp and axino lsp discussed in sec .",

    "sec : axinolsp ] .",
    "( i ) for the given nlsp mass , the effective total production of nlsp pairs is smaller here as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : neutralhiggsinopair ] because the model here relies on the ( associate ) productions of heavier higgsinos .",
    "( ii ) decays of nnlsp higgsinos to nlsp binos can produce observable particles as we assume about 50gev mass - gap .",
    "we will explain later how we treat these visible particles in our analysis .",
    "( iii ) now the decay pattern of the bino nlsp is relevant to collider searches instead of that of the higgsino .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : binodv ] , we analyze the exclusion bounds . again , both the @xmath44+met search ( constraining too much prompt decays ) and the cms dijet dv search ( constraining a certain range of displaced decay ) are relevant . for high enough @xmath2 scales , no bound exists ;",
    "either the bino decays still dominantly inside detector but its dv is not searched efficiently or the bino dominantly decays outside detector . when the bino decays outside detector , the visible decay products of nnlsp higgsinos can be important in collider searches  the collider physics will then be essentially the same as that of the higgsino nlsp and bino lsp considered in sec .  [",
    "sec : noaxino ] as if axinos were absent .",
    "however , the mass - gap between the higgsino and bino is only 50gev in this work , and by referring to fig .",
    "[ fig : higgsino3l ] showing the current bounds on the higgsino - bino model , we find that the visible decay products of higgsino nnlsp with such small - gap is weakly constrained .",
    "we conservatively assume that we can ignore all ( soft ) leptons from higgsino decays in our multi - lepton analysis , but we will include all and only leptons from bino decays to axinos in our analysis ( when binos decay promptly inside detector )  the more accurate analysis will not give a much stronger bound anyway .    the fig .",
    "[ fig : binodv ] , compared with fig .",
    "[ fig : higgsino - axino1 ] and [ fig : higgsino - axino2 ] , shows that the bound on this model is somewhat weaker than that of the higgsino - axino case in sec .",
    "[ sec : axinolsp ] . for @xmath90 ,",
    "no bounds from the dv search is derived . for @xmath32 ,",
    "no bounds from the multi - lepton search is derived .",
    "these weaker bounds are mainly because the effective total production of bino pairs is smaller for the given bino mass as discussed above and as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : neutralhiggsinopair ] .",
    "the results depend on the choice of @xmath101gev .",
    "the heavier higgsinos , the smaller signal productions and the weaker collider constraints  it is thus a less interesting scenario .",
    "the lighter higgsino closer to the bino can induce a larger mixing making binos decay more promptly ( but not faster than pure higgsinos discussed in previous section ) and the excluded parameter space change slightly .",
    "if we still assume that lepton from decays between those states are soft enough , not much qualitative change in the collider physics would arise .",
    "but again , in all , by having the axino lsp as well as light gauginos , some ranges of @xmath0 and @xmath2 can be probed at the lhc since the currently allowed range of @xmath2 falls in the right range to allow nlsp binos to decay inside detector either promptly or with dvs . on the other hand ,",
    "a higher @xmath95gev with @xmath96100 - 400gev can avoid all the current lhc searches .",
    "if the nnlsp higgsino is much heavier , the model has a looser connection with the naturalness ; in any case , no any sizable production modes are available then and the search will rely on heavier particle productions .",

    "we project the current cms dijet dv search results to study how high @xmath2 scale can be probed at 14tev .",
    "it is a techincally difficult task because future detectors are different and pile - up backgrounds at higher energy collisions are larger . we , however , parameterize the dv reconstruction efficiency which will be most dependent on detector performance by an unknown @xmath89 , and relatively hard cuts on jet @xmath103 used in this analysis ( @xmath104gev and @xmath105gev which shall be scaled up at 14tev ) will make the soft pile - up effects less influential .",
    "if we assume that cut / reconstuction efficiencies and the signal - to - background ratio after optimal cuts stay relatively constant between 8tev and 14tev analyses , the following simple scaling rule of the statistical significance is obtained ( significance)_i = = ( ) , = = , [ eq : scaling ] where each factor in the parenthesis , the signal - to - background ratio @xmath106 , signal cut efficiency @xmath107 and the assumed @xmath74 , stay constants as discussed .",
    "@xmath108 are production rates of signal and background , and the probability for displaced decays to be selected by the search , @xmath109 , depends on the @xmath2 and mass spectrum . in all , the significance simply scales with the square root of signal event counts .",
    "8tev cms dijet dv search bounds can be extrapolated to the 14tev bounds by finding proper @xmath2 and mass spectrum giving the same signal event counts as the upper bound of 8tev results .",

    "the implications and the consistency of having both light axinos and higgsinos are studied in the context of a few benchmark models of supersymmetry .",
    "interestingly , for the typical range of the pq scale , @xmath111gev , the electroweak - scale nlsp can still decay to the axino lsp inside detector both promptly and by leaving a dv .",
    "the @xmath44+met signature from the prompt decay of the nlsp is enhanced among standard susy searches as all heavier neutralinos and charginos decay promptly first to nlsp neutralinos so that nlsp neutralino pair productions which are relevant to the collider physics are effectively enhanced .",
    "the displaced decay of the nlsp is constrained by dedicated dv searches for a certain range of @xmath2 typically of @xmath112 depending on the mass spectrum ",

    ". a higher pq scale of @xmath113 with the electroweak - scale @xmath0 or the mass spectrum with small mass - gap between the nlsp and lsp is generally safe from all current collider searches .",
