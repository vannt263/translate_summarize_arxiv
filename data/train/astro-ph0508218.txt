    "in recent years , much attention has been devoted to the nature of the x - ray source rxj0806.3 + 1527 .",
    "the source was discovered by rosat in 1990 ( beuermann et al .",
    "1999 ) and found to be variable with a period of @xmath3s by israel et al .",
    "the latter authors tentatively ascribed the periodicity to the rotation of a white dwarf in an intermediate polar type cataclysmic variable ( see also beuermann et al .",
    "1999 ; burwitz & reinsch 2001 ; norton , haswell , & wynn 2004 ) .",
    "the absence of a second period ( corresponding to the orbital motion ) and the presence of he emission lines in an optical follow - up , however , lead israel et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to reclassify the system as an amcvn type double degenerate . in this picture , the @xmath3s periodicity reflects the orbital motion , making rxj0806.3 + 1527 the tightest known binary to date ( see also burwitz & reinsch 2001 ; ramsay , hakala , & cropper 2002 ) and an excellent verification source for the gravitational - wave space mission lisa planned by nasa and esa .",
    "more recent observations revealed two possibly major problems for the amcvn model : ( i ) israel et al .  ( 2003 ) , assuming a distance of 500pc , derived a _ low _ average x - ray luminosity of @xmath4 , and ( ii ) hakala et al .  ( 2003 ) and strohmayer ( 2003 ) found the observed period to be _ decreasing _ with time at a rate of @xmath5 ( see also israel et al .  2004 ;",
    "strohmayer 2005 ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosity poses a problem because it is significantly below the luminosity expected from mass accretion in compact double white dwarfs , while the period decrease poses a problem because mass transfer in amcvns is expected to expand the orbit rather than shrink it .",
    "a third possible model was therefore proposed to be the unipolar inductor model developed by wu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . in this model",
    "the x - ray flux is generated by electric currents between two close but detached white dwarfs .",
    "however , shortcomings of this model have recently been pointed out by barros et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and marsh & nelemans ( 2005 ) .",
    "the question on the nature of rxj0806.3 + 1527 therefore still remains open .    in this _",
    ", we revisit the amcvn model for rxj0806.3 + 1527 and investigate under which conditions the assumption of mass transfer ( mt ) between two white dwarfs can comfortably explain all the currently available observational constraints .",
    "our motivation stems from both trying to understand the origin of the x - ray emission and the measured period decrease and to examine the physical properties of this binary and its role as a verification source for lisa .",
    "we assume rxj0806.3 + 1527 to be an amcvn type double degenerate with an orbital period @xmath6min ( @xmath3s ) .",
    "we denote the masses of the two white dwarfs ( wd ) by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and assume @xmath9 so that the primary corresponds to the mass accretor and the secondary to the mass donor . since the evolutionary channels leading to the formation of amcvns involve multiple mt phases ( e.g. , han 1998 , nelemans et al .",
    "2001a ) , the orbit can be safely assumed circular .",
    "the assumptions that the observed periodicity of 5.4min corresponds to the orbital period and that the secondary fills its critical roche lobe can be used to constrain the mass @xmath8 and radius @xmath10 of the donor . for this purpose",
    ", we first determine the radius of the secondary as a function of its mass by means of the mass - radius relation for zero - temperature wds ( nauenberg 1972 ) : @xmath11^{1/2 } ,   \\label{r2}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the chandrasekhar mass ( see also han & webbink 1999 ) . the resulting radii are shown in fig .",
    "[ rlo ] ( solid line ) .",
    "next , we consider the mass - radius relations for finite temperature helium wds with masses from 0.1 to 0.4@xmath13 derived by hansen & phinney ( 1998 ) .",
    "radii for effective temperatures @xmath14 and @xmath15k , and hydrogen envelopes of @xmath16 and @xmath17 are shown in fig .",
    "[ rlo ] ( long - dashed lines ) .",
    "they are systematically larger than radii for zero - temperature wds , with the largest differences occurring at the lowest masses .    under the assumption that the secondary is not significantly out of thermal equilibrium , its radius is approximately equal to the volume - equivalent radius @xmath18 of its critical roche lobe ( see eggleton 1983 ) .",
    "the variations of the latter as a function of @xmath8 are shown in fig .",
    "[ rlo ] ( short - dashed lines ) for @xmath6min and @xmath19 .",
    "it follows that , for zero - temperature wd models , @xmath20 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( cf .",
    "israel et al .  2002 ) .",
    "finite - temperature mass - radius models yield larger donor masses and radii . for @xmath23k and @xmath24 ,",
    "e.g. , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "in amcvn binaries , the observed x - ray luminosity is generated by mass accretion onto the primary .",
    "ramsay et al .  (",
    "2005 ) have shown that a large fraction of the accretion luminosity in amcvns is radiated in the uv rather than in x - rays .",
    "in particular , they estimated the ratio of the x - ray luminosity to the uv luminosity to be @xmath27 for amcvn and @xmath28 for gpcom . in order to accommodate this",
    ", we set @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the x - ray and total accretion luminosity , respectively , and @xmath32 .",
    "we _ conservatively _ set @xmath33 and we note that @xmath34 can very well be lower by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "the linear dependence of @xmath30 on @xmath34 allows for an easy rescaling of our results for different values of @xmath34 .",
    "the accretion luminosity due to mt is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the fraction of the transferred mass accreted by the primary , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the roche potential values at the inner lagrangian point and at the surface of the accretor , respectively ( see han & webbink 1999 for details , but note the reverse definition of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) . to determine @xmath38 , we model the accretor as a zero - temperature white dwarf , noting that finite temperatures lead to an increase in the radius and thus a decrease in the absolute value of @xmath38 and @xmath31 .      in order to estimate the accretion rate and x - ray luminosity , we need to determine @xmath39 from the donor .",
    "we assume that mt turns on instantaneously when @xmath40 and that @xmath39 is given by the quasi - stationary rate @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the orbital angular momentum , @xmath43 and @xmath44 correspond to time derivatives of @xmath10 and @xmath42 at constant mass , @xmath45 is the donor s adiabatic radius - mass exponent , and @xmath46 ( e.g. rappaport , joss , & webbink 1982 ; ritter 1988 ; han & webbink 1999 ) .",
    "expressions for @xmath47 and @xmath48 appropriate for wds are given by han & webbink ( 1999 ) expression derived by han & webbink ( 1999 ) is valid only for zero - temperature wds [ @xmath8-@xmath10 relation as in eq .",
    "( [ r2 ] ) ] . in our finite - temperature wd calculations",
    "we therefore use a generalization of @xmath49 based on the @xmath8-@xmath10 relations of hansen & phinney ( 1998 ) .",
    "the adopted expression for @xmath48 is derived under the assumption that any mass lost from the system carries away the specific orbital angular momentum of the accretor . ] . for our purpose , we neglect changes in the stellar radius related to the cooling of the white dwarf at constant mass , and assume the orbital evolution in the absence of mt to be driven entirely by orbital angular momentum losses due to gravitational radiation ( gr ) . in eq .",
    "( [ qs ] ) , we then have @xmath50 and @xmath51 .    for zero - temperature wds ( i.e. @xmath52 ) , we calculate @xmath53@xmath54 for conservative mt ( @xmath55 ) , and @xmath56@xmath57 for non - conservative mt ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the associated x - ray luminosities are shown in fig .",
    "[ lx ] as functions of @xmath7 ( solid lines ) . for @xmath55",
    ", @xmath30 is well outside the grey horizontal band indicating the observational constraints on @xmath30 for distances between 100 and 1000pc ( israel et al .",
    "2002 , marsh & nelemans 2005 ) . for @xmath58 ,",
    "the calculated @xmath30 is consistent with the observed one if @xmath59 , a very narrow range of accretor masses ) is often approximated by @xmath60 .",
    "however , as noted by han & webbink ( 1999 ) , this is inappropriate for compact double wds in which the donor is located deep within the potential well of the accretor . for the system parameters considered here , the use of the approximation yields @xmath61 values up to a factor of @xmath62 larger than those shown in fig",
    "[ lx ] . ] . for a given value of @xmath36 , finite temperature wds give systematically higher mt rates and thus higher @xmath61 values .",
    "we conclude that the quasi - stationary mt rate [ eq .",
    "( [ qs ] ) ] yields @xmath61 values that are only marginally compatible with the observed range , _ unless _ @xmath63 ( as for amcvn ) _ and _ @xmath64 .",
    "however , it should be noted that the quasi - stationary rate is only representative of the long - term average mt rate .",
    "marsh & nelemans ( 2005 ) estimated that deviations from the quasi - stationary rate can take place on time scales of @xmath65yrs , suggesting that below - average mt rates could be sustained for time spans sufficiently longer than the 15 years since the discovery of the source .",
    "the mechanism responsible for driving the mt rate away from its equilibrium value remains unclear , but , as noted by marsh & nelemans ( 2005 ) , a comforting list of candidates exist , although their applicability to double wds has yet to be investigated .",
    "alternatively , the mt rate in rxj0806.3 + 1527 could also be below its long - term average if the system started mt only recently , and therefore is in a stage of atmospheric roche - lobe overflow ( rlo ) and has yet to evolve towards the quasi - stationary state .",
    "a modified rate applicable to turn - on mt was derived by ritter ( 1988 ) who pointed out the role of the atmospheric properties of the donor star during the turn - on phases ( see also dantona , mazzitelli , & ritter 1989 ; kolb & ritter 1990 ) .",
    "we therefore reconsider the @xmath30 derivation under the assumption that mt started only recently .    following ritter ( 1988 ) , we determine @xmath66 with an associated exponential turn - on time scale @xmath67 here @xmath68 is the newtonian constant of gravitation , @xmath69 the universal gas constant , @xmath70 the effective temperature , @xmath71 the photospheric mass density , @xmath72 the photospheric mean molecular weight , and @xmath73 the photospheric pressure scale height .",
    "furthermore , @xmath74 is a function of the mass ratio @xmath75 which , for @xmath76 , can be approximated as @xmath77 .    from eq .",
    "( [ m2dot ] ) , it is clear that , although convenient for the derivation of mass - radius relations , the zero - temperature approximation is not suitable when considering the turn - on mt rate in semi - detached double wds .",
    "instead we determine @xmath39 for a wd donor with a finite but low effective temperature @xmath78k .",
    "we set the mean molecular weight @xmath79 , as appropriate for a non - ionized helium - rich gas , and adopt the equation of state of an ideal gas to determine the mass density @xmath71 from the pressure @xmath80 and temperature @xmath70 .",
    "from the temperature - pressure stratifications for cool white dwarfs derived by saumon & jacobson ( 1995 ) and rohrmann ( 2001 ) , it then follows that @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the corresponding pressure scale height for @xmath52 and @xmath83 is @xmath84 .",
    "setting @xmath20 then yields mt rates @xmath85 and exponential turn - on time scales @xmath8612yrs .",
    "the corresponding x - ray luminosities are shown in fig .",
    "[ lx ] ( dashed lines ) .",
    "they are considerably lower than those obtained using the quasi - stationary mt rate and are consistent with the observed @xmath61 for a wide range of @xmath7 values , especially for @xmath87 .",
    "we note however that if @xmath88 , the @xmath89 case is more favorable .",
    "the derivation for wds of @xmath90k and @xmath15k yields @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and turn - on time scales of @xmath9315 and @xmath9420yrs , respectively .",
    "the associated @xmath61 are therefore even lower than those shown in fig .",
    "the amcvn model for rxj0806.3 + 1527 implies that the orbital period should be increasing in time , unless additional orbital angular momentum loss mechanisms besides gr are operating in the system ; or if mt started so recently that the accompanying orbital expansion has yet to overtake the orbital contraction driven by gr .",
    "exploration of the latter possibility requires detailed mt calculations using realistic wd models , which is beyond the scope of this investigation .",
    "instead , we focus on the additional orbital angular momentum losses required to reconcile the predicted orbital evolution with the measured period decrease of @xmath95 ( strohmayer 2005 ) .",
    "we tentatively ascribe the additional orbital angular momentum losses to spin - orbital coupling through tides and/or magnetic fields , although our analysis is generally valid for other mechanisms as well .    from the definition of @xmath42 and kepler s third law",

    "( [ jdot2 ] ) and  ( [ jdotmt ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ jdot ] ) , and use of the well known expression for @xmath99 ( e.g landau & lifshitz 1962 ) and the observed period and rate of period decrease yields the @xmath100 values required for consistency with observations . for zero - temperature wds ( @xmath52 ) , @xmath101 is shown in fig .",

    "this also applies to finite wd temperatures because of the low mt rates during the onset of rlo .",
    "we have revisited the amcvn model for rxj0806.3 + 1527 and confronted its theoretical predictions with the observational constraints . for an orbital period of 5.4min and a donor temperature of less than @xmath15k , rlo from",
    "the secondary occurs for @xmath109@xmath110 and @xmath111@xmath112 . under the assumptions that 10% of the transferred mass",
    "is accreted by the companion , and that 10% of accretion luminosity is radiated in x - rays , the x - ray luminosity due to accretion is found to be comfortably consistent with the observed x - ray luminosity within the distance uncertainties ( @xmath113kpc ) .",
    "we have examined both long - term quasi - stationary and short - term atmospheric mt with exponential growth .",
    "we found that the predicted @xmath61 and @xmath44 are more comfortably reconciled with the observations in the latter of the two cases .",
    "the lower mt rates for atmospheric rlo yield lower accretion luminosities , which significantly alleviates the constraints on the fraction of the mass accreted by the companion and the fraction of the accretion luminosity emitted in x - rays .",
    "the predicted orbital evolution is compatible with the measured period decrease , if orbital angular momentum losses other than just gr ( e.g.  due to spin - orbit coupling ) generally play a non - negligible role .",
    "we find that , in the case of quasi - stationary mt , an extra loss rate of at least a factor of @xmath114 times the gr rate is required . on the other hand , in the case of atmospheric mt , this factor is smaller than @xmath115 over the entire @xmath7 range and vanishes altogether for @xmath116m@xmath117 .",
    "the drawback of the atmospheric rlo hypothesis is that mt must have started only very recently ( within @xmath118 , i.e. , at most @xmath119yr ) .    the standard hypothesis of quasi - stationary mt ,",
    "however , can also become consistent with observations if mt is significantly non - conservative and the fraction of the accretion luminosity emitted in x - rays ( instead of uv ) is as low ( @xmath120 ) as estimated by ramsay et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for amcvn .",
    "the drawback of this hypothesis is that the required additional orbital angular momentum losses are about @xmath121 times the gr loss rate ( for @xmath122m@xmath117 ) . without a detailed study of spin - orbit coupling through tides and/or magnetic fields",
    "it is not obvious whether such high loss rates are sustainable .    besides spin - orbit coupling , the rate of orbital angular momentum loss",
    "can also be increased if matter leaving the system is assumed to carry away the specific orbital angular momentum of the donor rather than that of the accretor .",
    "in addition , if rxj0806.3 + 1527 is a direct impact accretor , the absence of an accretion disk provides yet another orbital angular momentum sink since no angular momentum from the accreted material can be directly fed back into the orbit ( marsh , nelemans , & steeghs 2004 ) .",
    "we also note that in the case of quasi - stationary mt , these extra orbital angular momentum losses tend to increase @xmath39 and @xmath61 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ lacc])([qs ] ) ] .",
    "for @xmath122m@xmath117 the increase is smaller though than the orders of magnitude uncertainty in the fraction of the accretion luminosity emitted in x - rays .",
    "we conclude that , in view of the uncertainties in the wd temperatures , the mt mechanism , the fraction of the accretion luminosity radiated in x - rays , and the acting orbital angular momentum loss mechanisms , the observed x - ray luminosity and rate of period decrease can not be used to exclude that rxj0806.3 + 1527 is an amcvn type double degenerate .",
    "the standard association of accretion and x - ray emission does not at all appear inconsistent with the current observations and hypotheses about the origin of the x - rays being unrelated to accretion are not necessary .",
    "the present study reveals the possibility of additional angular momentum loss rates due to spin - orbit coupling in double wds and clearly indicates that the use of these interacting binaries in lisa detection and data analysis may not be as straightforward as previously thought .",
