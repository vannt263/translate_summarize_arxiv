    "the phenomenon of superradiance has a long history dating back more than 60 years to the seminal paper by dicke  @xcite where the effect was predicted theoretically . over the past few decades",
    "the superradiance has been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental studies in a large variety of systems .",
    "these include molecular aggregates  @xcite , cold atoms  @xcite and bose - einstein condensates  @xcite , atomic nuclei  @xcite , magnetic nanoclusters  @xcite , heterostructures  @xcite and many others .    the key process underlying the mechanism of superradiance is phase synchronization of initially independent atoms caused by the coupling with a common environment represented by the electromagnetic field . in order for such process to occur",
    "the phase decoherence time of atoms should be longer than the photon travel time in the sample  @xcite .    for samples",
    "which size is smaller than the wavelength of radiation , this condition requires the density of atoms to be sufficiently high . the system - environment",
    "( atom - field ) coupling also manifests itself as an additional indirect interaction ( a sort of the transverse dipole - dipole interaction ) which may suppress superradiant transitions depending on the spatial distribution of atoms or the sample geometry  @xcite .    from the other hand ,",
    "when the density of atoms ( or , more generally , emitters ) is high the direct interparticle interaction starts to play an increasingly important part in determining cooperative behavior of the particles .",
    "in particular , this interaction strongly affects the properties of low - dimensional systems .",
    "the mott - insulator quantum phase transition in optically trapped atomic systems  @xcite and in solid structures  @xcite , generation of many - particle entangled states or many - particle coherent dynamics , as it is in the case of effectively interacting atoms inside a high quality dissipative cavity  @xcite , bose - einstein condensate  @xcite and in molecular clusters with strong magnetic  @xcite or coulomb @xcite correlations are examples .",
    "the direct interparticle interaction introduces additional correlations between emitters .",
    "these correlations considerably influence the cooperative optical properties of atoms .",
    "firstly , the interaction directly affects the superradiance leading to a number of peculiarities such as changing the order of superradiant phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "recently , the possibility of superradiant relaxation in strongly correlated systems was studied theoretically  @xcite .",
    "the experimental results for magnetic molecules of mn@xmath4-ac type were also reported in ref .",
    "earlier , systems of ferroelectric type with strong interparticle interaction were regarded as promising candidates for an active medium of the heat pumping laser  @xcite .",
    "secondly , the direct interparticle interaction can play the role of a phase synchronizing factor that may lead to the cooperative behavior which , though shares many common properties with the superradiance effect , essentially differs from superradiance in nature . the classical example furnishes the spectrum of p luminescence band in cds and zno where the emission intensity is proportional to the second power of the free exciton number ( pumping intensity ) . in this case",
    "the effect is caused by exciton - exciton scattering  @xcite .",
    "recently , such effects were observed in the microcrystalline phase of cspbcl@xmath5 thin films  @xcite .    for interacting atoms , the interaction can drastically change the regime of atom - photon dynamics by inducing ( otherwise , excluded ) multiphoton transitions  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that interatomic interaction can give rise to non - zero multiphoton emission observed with single - molecule spectroscopy technique as a two - photon cooperative effect for strongly dipole - dipole coupled molecules . theoretically , this phenomenon was predicted as a large two - atom two - photon resonant effect for two atoms inside a high - quality cavity  @xcite .",
    "so , different regimes of radiative decay in correlated atomic systems are mainly governed by the interatomic interaction . by controlling the interaction radiation properties of such systems",
    "can be widely varied ranging from superradiant transitions to the generation of the fock state of light .",
    "in particular , such control is feasible for the atoms in optical lattices ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    in this work cooperative radiation of interacting atoms coupled to electromagnetic bath",
    "will be of our primary interest .",
    "we are aimed to study different relaxation regimes determined by the intensity of interatomic coupling .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we formulate the model of @xmath6 two - level atoms with ising - type interaction and qualitatively discuss various regimes of relaxation by considering realignment of the atomic energy spectrum at different values of the interatomic coupling constant @xmath1 .",
    "there are two limiting cases of weak and strong interaction with @xmath0 and @xmath3 , respectively ( @xmath2 is the atomic frequency ) .",
    "we find that , for weakly interacting atoms , ising interaction would affect dynamical behavior of the system leading to the transition to collective pulse relaxation and enhancement of superradiance . for strong interaction , the regime of multiphoton relaxation is predicted to occur .",
    "it is also shown that dependence of the radiation intensity peak on the number of particles can be anomalous at long - range interatomic interaction .",
    "derivation of the master equation for weakly interacting atoms is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : master - equation ] .",
    "we show that , for certain atomic configurations , dephasing effects of induced dipole - dipole interaction can be suppressed and dynamics of the atomic system can be described by the simplified master equation .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : coop - rad - weakly ] , the effects for weakly interacting atoms briefly discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] are investigated in detail . by applying the mean field approximation",
    "we obtain the results that agree very well with those calculated by solving the equations for atomic variables numerically .",
    "the regime of multiphoton relaxation that takes place at strong interatomic interaction due to inhibition of one - particle one - photon transitions is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : multiphoton ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc - concl ] , we draw together the results , discuss solitonic mechanism of relaxation and make some concluding remarks .",
    "details on some technical results are relegated to appendixes  [ ap - born - markov]-  [ ap - fast - var ] .",
    "in order to illustrate a possibility of different relaxational regimes , caused by direct interatomic interaction , we consider a simplest model of a chain of two - level atoms with nearest neighbor ising - type interaction . typically , the models of this type are used to describe molecular systems with coulomb and magnetic interactions such as ferroelectric  @xcite and magnetic  @xcite clusters , interacting electrons in the tightly - binding approximation  @xcite , interacting atoms in optical lattice  @xcite , where the extended hubbard model is usually introduced .",
    "the interaction takes into account repulsion of the neighboring atoms so that the system may reveal the correlated many - particle behavior",
    ". when the energies of the neighbors are different tunneling transitions between neighboring sites are inelastic .",
    "in addition to the ising - type direct interaction , the atoms interact with a common electromagnetic field ( the atom - field interaction ) .",
    "these two interactions are combined to maintain correlations in the atomic subsystem thus crucially affecting the regimes of cooperative optical transitions .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model atomic chain with the short - range ising - type interaction can be written in the following form    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the hamiltonian of atomic subsystem , @xmath9 is the hamiltonian of electromagnetic field and @xmath10\\ ] ] is the hamiltonian of the atom - field interaction and h.c .",

    "the dynamics of the collective relaxation of initially inverted atomic subsystem will be of our primary concern .",
    "more specifically , we shall study various dynamical scenarios that occur at different values of the coupling constant @xmath1 .",
    "in the remaining part of this section we first discuss energy spectrum of the atomic subsystem and qualitatively describe these dynamical regimes .",
    "the transition energy of an atom depends on the states of its neighbors as a result of interatomic interaction .",
    "this effect can be described as renormalization of the transition frequency of the @xmath14th atom @xmath28 which can also be readily seen from the mean field expression for the hamiltonian @xmath27 : @xmath29 s^z_i=\\sum_i\\hbar\\tilde\\omega_i s^z_i.\\ ] ]    sufficiently weak interaction , @xmath30 , results in inhomogeneous broadening of the radiation spectrum .",
    "when the coupling constant of interatomic interaction @xmath1 increases and @xmath0 , the spectrum of the atomic subsystem undergoes more pronounced rearrangement . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] , the spectrum is no longer equidistant , but its structure is identical to that for non - interacting atoms with @xmath31 . in particular",
    ", the latter implies that the state with all the atoms excited @xmath32 ( spin up represents the excited state of the atom ) gives the level of highest energy and the level of lowest energy corresponds to the case where atoms are all in the ground states @xmath33 .",
    "similar to the case of non - interacting atoms , the dynamics of radiative decay is dominated by one - particle one - photon transitions and can be described using the born - markov approximation",
    ".    a cooperative relaxation of the system from an excited state can be realized by different schemes of transitions .",
    "it is a possibility to have a generation in the two mode regime with the frequencies @xmath34 ( see fig .",
    "[ spectra]a ) arising due to renormalization of the atomic frequency @xmath35 that governs the intensity of radiation .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that the intensity of atom radiation @xmath36 is proportional to the fourth power of the transition frequency @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the transverse dipole moment of the atomic transition . for @xmath6",
    "weakly interacting atoms , the intensity @xmath36 is defined by the renormalized frequency and can be represented by a sum of the coherent and the incoherent parts , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "dependence of the renormalized frequency on the states of neighboring atoms introduces additional correlations into the incoherent part of radiation .",
    "such correlations may result in a cooperative radiation of fundamentally different origin than superradiance described by the coherent part @xmath42 .",
    "the effect of superradiance , for its part , can be enhanced by the ising - type interaction which may act as a phase synchronizing factor .",
    "it is also worth noting that , for a long - range interparticle interaction , the renormalized frequency @xmath35 depends on the number of atoms , @xmath43 , leading to anomaly in the @xmath6-dependence of the intensity peak of collective radiation .",
    "figure  [ spectra]a shows that , when the atomic subsystem is not completely inverted , an excited state may relax through a series of transitions which frequencies are identically equal to the resonant frequency @xmath2 .",
    "this regime of relaxation resembles the solitonic mechanism where the process of emission is connected with inelastic motion of defects ( bloch walls ) induced by a short - range interaction .",
    "we shall discuss this point at greater length in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc - concl ] .      in the case of strong interaction with @xmath3 , arrangement of the energy level",
    "significantly differs from that of non - interacting atoms . now",
    "the state @xmath44 does not give the level of highest energy and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the energy of the state with @xmath47 excited atoms .",
    "such realignment indicates that many - atom multiphoton transitions will dominate the process of relaxation .",
    "figure  [ spectra]b illustrates that , in the limiting case with @xmath48 , the states @xmath44 and @xmath49 give two lowest lying energy levels .",
    "they are separated from the other excited states by the gap of the width @xmath50 .",
    "relaxation of fully inverted state ( transition from @xmath44 to @xmath49 ) can be achieved through a @xmath6-photon process .    at this stage",
    "it should be stressed that an accurate description of the interaction between the system and the field in the presence of strong interatomic correlations requires careful consideration of interplay between many - atom multiphoton dipole and multipole transitions . in a sense",
    ", our system can be regarded as an intermediate case between a collection of two - level atoms independently interacting with the field and a single many - level system .",
    "a good example provides the spin - phonon interaction in magnetic molecules mn@xmath4o@xmath4 of the multipole form @xmath51 which symmetry is consistent with the anisotropy energy  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the spin superradiance in atomic nuclei can be dominated by multipole transitions  @xcite .    for the multipole superradiance",
    "@xcite , the exponent of the @xmath6-dependence of the radiation intensity peak ( @xmath6 is the number of emitters ) can be greater than two , @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "this is the case for the cooperative spin - phonon relaxation in mn@xmath4o@xmath4 where a rough estimate gives @xmath54 .",
    "the standard approach to the dissipative dynamics of atoms relies on the lindblad equation for the reduced density matrix of the atomic subsystem derived by eliminating boson variables from the master equation for the density operator of atom - field system .",
    "this master equation is obtained using the born - markov approximation  @xcite that neglects multiphoton transitions and thus is applicable only for weakly interacting atoms at @xmath0 . in the subsequent section",
    "we discuss the derivation procedure for the lindblad equation for the density matrix of weakly interacting atoms .",
    "in this section we derive and discuss the master equation for the reduced atomic density operator @xmath55 for the case of weak interaction at @xmath0 .",
    "we show that the direct interaction renormalizes both the induced dipole - dipole interaction and the damping operator in the lindblad equation . in addition , we find that , under certain conditions , destructive effect of the dipole - dipole interaction on supperradiance is suppressed .        as it was pointed out in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , for the @xmath14th atom , the energy of transition depends on the state of the neighboring atoms .",
    "alignment of the energy spectrum of the atomic subsystem and , as a result , the character of atom - field interaction are determined by the value of the ratio @xmath59 .",
    "when @xmath3 and @xmath60 , ordering of the energy levels changes and certain transitions appear to be excluded .    in eq .",
    "the frequency of the dipole transition is effectively described by the operator   @xmath61 entering the hamiltonian of interaction @xmath62 .",
    "as opposed to the case with @xmath63 , the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath64 can be negative at @xmath60 depending on @xmath65 and @xmath14 .    in this case , for example",
    ", the energy @xmath66 of the `` monodomain '' state @xmath67 is below the energy @xmath68 of the state where only one atom is in the ground state @xmath69 .",
    "the result is that relaxation of the completely inverted state @xmath67 can not occur as a one - photon process .",
    "it should be noted that , for @xmath60 , the change of sign in the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath64 introduces new resonant terms of the form @xmath70 .",
    "however , as it was discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : strong - interaction ] , this case is additionally complicated by multipole transitions that need to be taken into consideration .",
    "when @xmath0 and @xmath63 , the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath64 are all positive .",
    "so the ising - type interaction just renormalizes the transition frequencies inducing additional correlations in the atomic subsystem .",
    "dynamics of the atomic relaxation is now governed by one - photon processes and , in the remaining part of this section , we restrict ourselves to this case of weakly interacting atoms with @xmath63 .",
    "we can now use the born approximation to derive the equation for the reduced density matrix of the atomic subsystem  @xcite , @xmath71 . for simplicity , we consider the zero - temperature case where only vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field are taken into account .",
    "so , the density operator @xmath56 can be written in the following form @xmath72    we additionally assume that the wavelength of radiation is much longer than the size of the system and use the markov approximation  @xcite . omitting the technical details that can be found in appendix  [ ap - born - markov ] ,",

    "we used operator functions defined on eigenvalues of @xmath82 , so that if @xmath83 then , e.g. , @xmath84 .",
    "it should be stressed once again that eq .",
    "is valid only for the case of weakly interacting atoms , when @xmath0 and the born - markov approximation is applicable .",
    "principal values of the integrals that enter the right hand side of the master equation   define the dipole - dipole interatomic interaction ( see appendix  [ ap - born - markov ] ) and the bethe - part of the lamb shift , which depend on the direct interparticle interaction .",
    "equation   can be further simplified under the condition that the characteristic wavelength of radiation @xmath85 is much longer than the size of the sample .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that in this case the dipole - dipole interaction is of quasi - static character and is independent of the frequency of atomic transition . since the direct interaction in eq",
    "just renormalizes the atomic frequencies @xmath86 , the asymptotic form of the dipole - dipole interaction in the limit @xmath87 must be identical to that for the system of non - interacting atoms with @xmath31 . at the same time",

    "the key feature of this equation is that only the damping terms are renormalized by the direct interatomic interaction at @xmath95 .",
    "it is known ( see , e.g. , reviews  @xcite ) that the dipole - dipole interaction may destroy the cooperative radiation due to the frequency chirping effect .",
    "this effect is caused by the dynamical shift of energy levels that results in a rapid loss of phase synchronization with the characteristic time of phase decoherence much shorter than the rate of relaxation  @xcite .",
    "influence of the dipole - dipole interaction on the dynamics of the atomic subsystem is strongly affected by the spatial configuration of atoms and the angular distribution of dipole moments .",
    "it turns out that , for certain configurations , dephasing induced by the dipole - dipole interaction is inhibited and the cooperative radiation takes place  @xcite .    in particular",
    ", the latter is the case when atoms are all in identical environment and the system is invariant under permutations of atoms , @xmath96 .",
    "these conditions are met for a two atom system or an atomic ring  @xcite .    for disordered atomic configuration ( atomic cloud ) ,",
    "the superradiance effect depends on the sample shape .",
    "it can occur for pencil - shape patterns as a result of suppression of the destructive effect of the dipole - dipole interaction  @xcite .    in our case ,",
    "when the interatomic spacings is much smaller than the wavelength ( @xmath95 ) , the form of the dipole - dipole interaction   is the same for both interacting and non - interacting atoms .",
    "symmetry of the renormalized damping terms is also identical to the symmetry of the system of non - interacting atoms with @xmath31 .",
    "so , atomic configurations suppressing the dephasing effect of the dipole - dipole interaction are the same for both cases : @xmath31 and @xmath97 .",
    "for the simplest case of two atomic configuration , this point can be illustrated explicitly .",
    "similar to the case of two non - interacting atoms considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , the master equation   for two atoms with @xmath97 is exactly solvable .",
    "the exact solution described in appendix  [ ap-2atbm ] shows that relaxation is independent of the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "the analytical results presented in appendix  [ ap-2atbm ] can also be used to demonstrate the effect of additional correlations induced by the interaction . for this purpose",

    "[ 2atbm ] the relaxation rate   is plotted as a function of time at various values of @xmath65 .",

    "by contrast to the case of non - interacting atoms with @xmath101 , the system features collective decay with a pronounced emitted pulse arising as a result of additional correlations induced by ising - type interaction .    now it is our primary task to examine how the cooperative relaxation is influenced by the interatomic interaction .",
    "so , in what follows we shall restrict our study to the atomic configurations where the frequency chirping effect can be disregarded .",
    "for such configurations , the master equation   can be considerably simplified by neglecting the terms describing the dipole - dipole interaction .",

    "the presence of the factor @xmath138 in eq .",
    "indicates that the direct interaction introduces additional correlations into both the coherent and the incoherent parts of radiation .",

    "the curves show that the critical number of atoms and the supperradiance transition are almost insensible to the interatomic interaction .",
    "so , similar to the case of non - interacting atoms , we have two qualitatively different regimes of relaxation : the incoherent regime at @xmath140 and the regime of superradiance at @xmath141 .",

    "[ n10 ] .    referring to fig .",
    "[ n10 ] , it is seen that , in the absence of interaction ( @xmath31 and @xmath127 ) , relaxation occurs as an incoherent spontaneous decay of excited atoms .",
    "this regime is characterized by a monotonic exponential decrease of the relaxation rate .    when the interaction parameter @xmath65 increases , spontaneous processes are suppressed and the time dependence of the relaxation rate reveals a non - monotonic behavior with a pronounced peak ( see fig .",

    "this is the regime of collective pulse relaxation induced by the direct interatomic interaction .",
    "collective pulse relaxation can be easily described using the mean field approximation for decoupling of correlations . to this end",
    "we assume that , for small number of atoms , the relaxation rate   is predominantly determined by the first term ( incoherent part ) describing incoherent mechanism of decay .",
    "so , the equation   takes the simplified form :    @xmath143    we can now substitute the ansatz @xmath144 assuming that @xmath145 , into eq .   and use the relation   to derive the equation governing dynamics of atomic subsystem @xmath146 where @xmath147    it can be shown that the mean field solution @xmath148 is a step - like function of time and is stable at @xmath149 .",

    "is much smaller than that of single - photon transitions .",
    "so , the first order of the perturbative expansion over the atom - field interaction can be used to describe dynamical behavior of the system . at strong interaction with @xmath3 ,",

    "relaxation occurs as a two - photon process .",
    "probability of multiphoton transitions for @xmath6 excited atoms in free space is small because its magnitude is determined by @xmath6-th order term of perturbative expansion over the atom - field coupling constant @xmath174 .",
    "so , we arrive at the conclusion that the effect of interatomic interaction can be the formation of long living excited states in the system .",
    "this conclusion , however , is not strictly valid if the density of electromagnetic modes has a singularity near the energy of atomic transition , @xmath175 .",

    "is accompanied by transition from the regime of cooperative pulse radiation ( superradiance ) to the generation of fock state of light . in a cavity ,",
    "multiphoton dynamical effects come into play under the condition @xmath188 , so that the level of intermediate energy is essentially shifted away from one - photon resonance ( see fig .",

    "we studied effects of direct interatomic interaction on collective processes in atom - photon dynamics using , as an example , a simple model of two - level atoms with ising interaction of ferromagnetic type .",
    "we have found that this interaction influences radiation processes of atomic ensemble acting as an additional synchronizing factor .    for weakly interacting atoms at @xmath0 , we have shown that interatomic interaction results in inhibition of incoherent spontaneous decay of atoms and dynamical behavior of the system is governed by the regime of collective pulse relaxation .",
    "this regime , though it bears a resemblance to superradiance , has nothing to do with the effect of phase synchronization induced by fluctuations of the electromagnetic field . for a example , in solid state structures , collective pulse relaxation is caused by inelastic exciton - exciton scattering and is characterized by quadratic dependence of the radiation peak on the number of particles  @xcite .",
    "we have also found that interaction induced synchronization enhances superradiance and can be responsible for anomalous dependence of the radiation peak on the number of particles . in the presence of interparticle interaction collective pulse radiation and enhanced superradiance",
    "are both characterized by an increase in the delay time of emission .    at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : weak - interaction ] , we have pointed out that when the excited state is not fully inverted its relaxation can be determined by transitions with frequencies equal to the atomic resonant frequency @xmath2 .",
    "if we consider non - excited atoms of the initial state as defects of the atomic chain , such relaxation scheme can be referred to as the solitonic mechanism of relaxation .",
    "the solitonic mechanism implies that in the course of relaxation atoms undergo transition to the ground state successively one after another .",
    "so , such behavior can be interpreted as a defect motion . more generally ,",
    "since the system of equations   governing dynamics of atoms at @xmath0 is similar in structure to the volterra system and the toda lattice  @xcite , it might be expected that the system posses soliton - like solutions .",

    "the peak is caused by collective pulse relaxation indicating that the retardation time of emission is too short for the defect to travel through the ring .",
    "however , it should be noted that we have neglected the dipole - dipole interaction by considering permutationally invariant atomic configurations , the approximation that is not valid in the presence of defect in the system .",
    "this interaction may have a destructive effect on the solitonic mechanism of relaxation .",
    "by contrast to the case of weakly interacting atoms where dynamics of the atomic subsystem is governed by one - particle one - photon transitions , at strong interatomic interaction with @xmath48 , these transitions appear to be excluded . in this case",
    "multiphoton transitions will determine relaxation of the excited atomic subsystem .",
    "this is what we called the regime of multiphoton relaxation .",
    "the regime is characterized by transition from generation of superradiant pulse to generation of fock quantum state of light .",
    "we have used a simple model of two atoms in a high - q single mode cavity to show that such transition is accompanied by rabi oscillations involving many - atom multiphoton states . in other words , it means generating many - particle entangled atom - field state  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , transition to multiphoton dynamics is analogous to the mott - insulator quantum phase transition in optically trapped atomic systems where fock state characterizing the number of localized atoms is formed  @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the energy of atomic transition @xmath175 and the interatomic coupling @xmath1 play the role of kinetic and potential energy , respectively .",
    "so , the transition to generation of the fock state of light takes place when the potential energy @xmath1 becomes greater than @xmath175 .    in lattice atomic systems with inelastic tunneling transitions between neighboring wells ,",
    "the mott or peierls transitions and the transition to multiphoton relaxation can be related to each other .",

    "possibility of the density waves mott - insulator phase for atoms embedded into an optical lattice was also discussed in ref .",

    "we also have not discussed superradiant and subradiant dicke states .",
