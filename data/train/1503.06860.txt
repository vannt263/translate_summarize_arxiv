    "it is well known that confining the dimensions of a physical system frequently leads to exciting new effects . for example confining electrons to a single dimension results in the breakdown of the fermi liquid model , and the observation of exotic transport behavior @xcite .",
    "similarly , there is no long - range magnetic order in two dimensions @xcite . in @xmath7-electron materials , where magnetic and electronic degrees of freedom are typically strongly coupled , the effects of dimensionality are currently under debate @xcite .",
    "notably , it has been proposed that dimension can be used to tune the type of observed quantum phase transitions , where either the electronic or magnetic degrees of freedom become quantum critical @xcite .",
    "the entanglement of electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom in @xmath7-electron compounds is controlled via two magnetic interactions .",
    "a large on - site coulomb repulsion tends to localize the @xmath7-electron wave function , producing magnetic moments that interact indirectly with each other via the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction , which leads to a long - range antiferromagnetic order . on the other hand , below a characteristic temperature @xmath8 , the kondo interaction @xcite drives the local demagnetization of the @xmath7-electron state that is quenched by the spins of the surrounding conduction electrons .",
    "this results in delocalization of the @xmath7-electrons into the conduction band and thus the formation of a paramagnetic heavy fermi liquid state @xcite .",
    "the most interesting situation occurs when kondo and rkky interactions are of comparable size  @xcite . at this point ,",
    "the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature is suppressed to zero resulting in a quantum critical point ( qcp ) where the associated long - wavelength quantum critical magnetic fluctuations are believed to lead to the emergence of novel states of matter  @xcite , with the most prominent one being unconventional superconductivity @xcite . apart from this prototypical qcp scenario @xcite",
    ", so - called local quantum criticality has been proposed for the case that the kondo temperature is suppressed to zero at the qcp , resulting in local critical fluctuations associated with the fermi surface . in this scenario ,",
    "the fermi surface is large on one side of the qcp because it includes the delocalized @xmath7-electrons , and is small on the other because the @xmath7-elctrons are localized and do not contribute to the fermi volume @xcite .",
    "recent calculations suggest that the type of qcp may be controlled via the dimensionality of the system @xcite .",
    "apart from influencing the type of qcp , lowering the dimensionality is also believed to result in an increase of the superconducting transition temperature @xcite .",
    "this calls for new classes of @xmath7-electron materials in which the dimensionality can be systematically tuned .",
    "we recently synthesized ce@xmath9al@xmath0si@xmath1 ( @xmath9 = rh , ir , pt ) compounds that are promising in this regard @xcite .",
    "these materials crystallize in kcu@xmath0s@xmath10 structure type with tetragonal space group p4/mmm ( # 123 ) , and exhibit a sequential stacking of a baal@xmath0-type ce - containing layer separated by a aual@xmath1-type @xmath9-containing block along the @xmath6-axis ( fig .",

    "although two magnetic transitions were clearly found in bulk properties measurements , no magnetic bragg peaks were observed between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",

    "moreover , the magnitude of the ordered magnetic moments are much smaller than than the moment size of a free ce@xmath20 ion given by @xmath39 = 2.14 @xmath5 .",
    "typically , a reduction of the ordered moment in rare earth systems may be due to crystal field effects and/or to kondo screening .",
    "_ @xcite suggested that crystal field effects alone can not describe the reduced size of the magnetic moment and attributed the reduction of the moment to the kondo screening of the @xmath14 moments .",
    "this is supported by heat capacity measurements @xcite , which indicate that the sommerfeld coefficient is large in cerhal@xmath0si@xmath1 ( @xmath40 mj / molk - k@xmath41 ) , and moderately enhanced in ceiral@xmath0si@xmath1 ( @xmath42 mj / molk - k@xmath41 ) , implying that kondo screening is indeed an important effect in these compounds .",
    "we note that ultimately a determination of the crystal electric field parameters by neutron or x - ray scattering will be useful to elucidate the relative roles of kondo and crystal fields effects on the size of the ordered moment .    assuming that the kondo effect is indeed the main contributor in reducing the size of the magnetic moment",
    ", both cerhal@xmath0si@xmath1 and ceiral@xmath0si@xmath1 appear to be promising candidates to investigate the interplay of electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom near a qcp while tuning the dimensionality of the magnetic interactions . because of its lower magnetic ordering temperature and larger sommerfeld coefficient ( i.e. larger kondo interaction ) , cerhal@xmath0si@xmath1 is likely to be nearer to a putative antiferromagnetic qcp",
