    "reaction fronts formed in diffusion - limited @xmath0 type reactions have been investigated intensively in recents years  @xcite .",
    "the motivation comes partly from the realization that moving reaction fronts play an important role in a great variety of physical and chemical phenomena which display pattern formation  @xcite .",
    "another reason for the interest is the simplicity of the problem which allows the application of different theoretical approaches .",
    "indeed , the front properties have been studied in detail by using mean - field and scaling theories  @xcite , dynamical renormalization group  @xcite , numerical simulations  @xcite ) and in some cases exact analytical predictions have also been made  @xcite .    in most of the cases studied previously , the reaction front is formed after the spatially separated components @xmath2 and @xmath3 come into contact .",
    "for example , in a typical experiment aimed at producing liesegang bands  @xcite , one has a vertical tube of gel soaked with component @xmath3 , and , at time @xmath4 , a liquid containing the reagent @xmath2 is poured over the gel ( in order to eliminate convection effects , the liquid is sometimes replaced with another gel containing @xmath2 ) .",
    "the theoretical equivalent of this situation is that the reagents are separated by a wall which is removed at @xmath4 and then the reaction - diffusion process begins .",
    "one can imagine , however , that there are situations when the wall between the reagents is present at all times , and this wall is semipermeable allowing only one of the reagents to pass through .",
    "it may happen , for example , in the above discussed setup that @xmath3 is not soluble in the liquid containing @xmath2 which is effectively equivalent to the presence of a semipermeable wall .",
    "more importantly , chemical reactions in biological systems take usually place in strongly inhomogeneous media with semipermeable walls present  @xcite .",
    "thus , we believe it is important ( hence the aim of this paper ) to consider the formation of reaction fronts in systems with initial separated species when the wall separating the two species is not eliminated at @xmath4 but is replaced by a semipermeable wall which allows only one of the reagents ( @xmath2 ) to diffuse across .    using a mean - field description of the above process , we find that the control parameter in this system is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the initial particles densities while @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the diffusion coefficients .",
    "we show that , depending on the sign of @xmath10 , three distinct types of behavior occur . when @xmath11 , the @xmath2 particles invade the @xmath3 phase .",
    "the reaction front moves away from the semipermeable wall with the distance from the wall increasing as @xmath12 and the wall is irrelevant in the long time regime .",
    "thus , one recovers the predictions ( e.g. the width of the reaction zone scales as @xmath13 ) made with no semipermeable wall present  @xcite . in the opposite case , @xmath14",
    ", the wall prevents the @xmath3 particles from invading the @xmath2 region and , accordingly , the reaction front becomes localized ( with finite width ) at the semipermeable wall .",
    "it turns out that the dividing point between the @xmath11 and @xmath14 cases is a critical point in the sense that the width of the reaction zone diverges at @xmath15 .",
    "we have thus found a critical localization - delocalization transition from a reaction front localized at the wall to a front detached and moving away from the wall .",
    "the above results will be derived and discussed first by defining the model ( dynamical equations and the boundary conditions ) in sec .",
    "then , the different regimes are analyzed ( sec .",
    "iii ) both analytically and numerically at the mean - field level with comments on the role of the fluctuations . concluding remarks are given in sec . iv .",
    "the basic notions about reaction zones have been introduced for the @xmath16 process @xcite and , in order to keep the discussion transparent , we shall also consider this case .",
    "more complicated reaction schemes @xmath17 can be treated along the same line with the same general picture arising .",
    "we shall assume that the transport kinetics of the reagents is dominated by diffusion and that the reaction kinetics is of second order .",
    "thus , at a mean - field level , the mathematical description of the process is given in terms of reaction - diffusion equations @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the densities of the reagents @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the corresponding diffusion constants , and the reaction - rate parameter is @xmath21 .",
    "note that there is a conservation law in this system .",
    "since the @xmath2 and @xmath3 particles react in pairs the difference in their numbers is conserved . in terms of the densities",
    "this means that the spatial integral of @xmath22 is constant unless there are particle sources at the boundaries .",
    "the semipermeable membrane is located at the @xmath23 plane .",
    "initially , all @xmath3 particles are on the right hand side of this membrane ( @xmath24 ) and , since the membrane is impenetrable for them , they remain on that side for all times . in terms of the particle density",
    "@xmath20 this means that the solution of ( [ a2 ] ) and ( [ b2 ] ) must satisfy the following conditions @xmath25    the motion of the @xmath2 particles is not influenced by the membrane and , initially , they are on the left side of it . furthermore , the initial densities are assumed to be constant i.e. @xmath26 and @xmath27 for @xmath28 while @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath24 . with this choice of initial state ,",
    "the solution of ( [ a2 ] ) and ( [ b2 ] ) depends only on the @xmath31 spatial coordinate and the system effectively becomes one - dimensional .",
    "our aim will be to calculate the production rate of @xmath32 particles defined by @xmath33 and investigate the time - evolution of its spatial structure with emphasis on the center @xmath34 and the width of the reaction zone @xmath35^{1/2}. \\label{width}\\ ] ] both @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the easily measurable quantities in experiments and simulations .",
    "for a system without the membrane , it is known  @xcite that the reaction front will move to the right ( @xmath2 invades @xmath3 ) or to the left ( @xmath3 invades @xmath2 ) depending on the relative magnitude of quasistationary diffusive currents ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) , i.e. depending on the sign of the control parameter @xmath10:@xmath40 for @xmath41 , the front is stationary in the sense that although @xmath42 remains time - dependent for large times , the center of the reaction zone does not move and @xmath43 approaches a finite constant .",
    "one expects that the direction of invasion plays an important role in the presence of the membrane as well and , accordingly , we shall analyze the @xmath11 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 cases separately .      for @xmath11 ,",
    "the diffusive current of @xmath2 particles overwhelms the corresponding current of @xmath3 particles and thus the reaction front moves to the right . after a while ,",
    "the @xmath3 particles disappear from the neighborhood of the membrane and thus the membrane does not play a role anymore . consequently , the reaction front leaves the membrane ( fig.[fig1 ] ) and all the results about the long - time scaling form of the reaction front obtained previously apply  @xcite , namely @xmath44 where the position of the center of the front , @xmath36 , scales with time as @xmath45 , the width of the reaction front is proportional to @xmath46 with @xmath47 , the scaling exponent of the production rate of @xmath32 at @xmath48 is @xmath49 , and the scaling function , @xmath50 , is a fast decreasing function for @xmath51 .    we can call this front delocalized since both the center and the width of the front diverge in the long - time limit .    in closing this subsection , we note that the above results are modified by fluctuations in low dimensions ( @xmath52 ) , as discussed in several works on @xmath16 reactions without the presence of a membrane @xcite .      for @xmath14",
    ", the @xmath3 particles would be the invading particles but they can not penetrate past the membrane .",
    "thus , one expects that there will be a finite density of @xmath3 particles at @xmath53 and , consequently , the @xmath2 particles can penetrate into the @xmath24 region only up to a finite distance , @xmath54 . in order to make this picture ( fig.[fig2 ] ) quantitative",
    ", we shall first solve the problem on the diffusive lengthscale @xmath55 and then use this solution as the large - argument asymptotics of the solution around @xmath53 .",
    "viewing the process on the diffusive lengthscale , the reaction zone is reduced to a point ( @xmath53 ) and the diffusion of @xmath2 and @xmath3 takes place separately in the @xmath28 and @xmath24 regions .",
    "the appropriate boundary conditions are as follows : @xmath56 @xmath57 the first boundary conditions in ( [ boundcond1 ] ) and ( [ boundcond2 ] ) are obvious while the second boundary condition in ( [ boundcond2 ] ) is just the expression of the equality of the currents entering the reaction zone .",
    "the second condition in ( [ boundcond1 ] ) is more complicated .",
    "it follows from the assumption that the penetration length , @xmath54 , is finite combined with the fact that the diffusion current approaches zero at large times , [ @xmath58 i.e. the derivative @xmath59 diminishes for @xmath60 .",
    "the finiteness of @xmath54 , in turn , follows from the finiteness of @xmath61 and so , finding @xmath62 finite at the end of our calculation provides a selfconsistency check of the underlying picture .",
    "the solution of the diffusion equations with the above boundary conditions is given by @xmath63 where erf@xmath64 is the error function  @xcite and @xmath65 is found from the second condition in ( [ boundcond2 ] ) : @xmath66 as we can see , @xmath62 is indeed finite for finite @xmath14 ( @xmath67 because it has the meaning of particle density ) .",
    "the above results are valid on lengthscale @xmath68 . in order to investigate the details of the reaction zone , we must consider the @xmath69 region ( fig.[fig3 ] ) where we should find a solution with large - distance asymptotics which matches to the solution found above .    since we are mainly interested to find the extent of the region where the reaction product appears , we should find the region of penetration of @xmath2 particles into the @xmath24 halfspace . for @xmath70 , one can approximate @xmath71 and then the equation for @xmath19 becomes linear @xmath72 this equation is supplemented with the following boundary conditions @xmath73 the second condition comes from the fact that the diffusion current entering the reaction zone at @xmath53 must be equal to that calculated from the macroscopic @xmath74 considerations .",
    "due to the slowness of diffusion , @xmath75 changes slowly at large times and one can consider quasistatic approximation . looking for a solution of the form @xmath76 one can see that the left hand side of ( [ alinear ] ) is of the order @xmath77 while the right hand side is proportional to @xmath78 and so , the time derivative can be neglected . the resulting equation for @xmath79 can be easily solved and the boundary conditions can be satisfied yielding a solution in a scaling form : @xmath80 where the penetration ( or correlation ) length is given by @xmath81 since @xmath71 in the reaction zone , we can obtain @xmath42 from ( [ scalinga ] ) : @xmath82    thus the reaction rate goes down with time as @xmath83 while the center and the width of the reaction zone remain finite in this scaling limit @xmath84 one can see from fig.[fig4 ] that the scaling form ( [ scalinga ] ) agrees with the scaling obtained from the numerical solution of the full set of equations ( [ a2 ] ) and ( [ b2 ] ) .",
    "the phase considered above may be called the phase of localized reaction zone .",
    "one can observe from ( [ penetlength ] ) , however , that @xmath54 diverges as we approach the @xmath15 point and thus the reaction zone becomes delocalized at @xmath41 .",
    "thus @xmath10 plays the role of the distance from a critical point and the exponent we found , @xmath85 is obviously the mean - field exponent @xmath86 in accord with the neglect of fluctuations in the above description .",
    "it follows from the previous subsection that the @xmath15 case can be considered as a critical point which separates the localized and delocalized phases .",
    "thus we expect that a scaling description is valid again at @xmath41 but , in expressions like ( [ scalinga ] ) , the correlation length must be replaced by a time - dependent correlation length which scales as a power of time , @xmath87 . in order to see that this picture is valid , we follow the steps of the previous subsection : the problem is first solved on the diffusion scale [ the solution is actually given by equations ( [ solution_a ] ) and ( [ solution_b ] ) with @xmath88 and then matching solution in the @xmath89 region is found ( fig.[fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] ) .    in the @xmath89 region",
    "we seek scaling solutions suggested by eq.([scalinga ] ) @xmath90 several comments are in order to clarify the above scaling assumptions .",
    "first , the scaling of @xmath31 by the same @xmath46 in @xmath91 and @xmath92 is the assumption that there is only one lengthscale governing the reaction zone .",
    "second , the exponent @xmath93 should be @xmath94 or less since the case without the membrane gives an upper limit for the spread of the reaction zone and there the width is proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "finally , one should note that the exponent , @xmath95 , of the prefactors of the scaling functions is , in principle , an independent exponent . in this case , however , it is fixed by the boundary condition @xmath96 and by the requirement that the large argument asymptotics of @xmath97 should match the solution obtained on the @xmath98 scale .    substituting the scaling forms ( [ scalingab ] ) into equations ( [ a2],[b2 ] )",
    ", one finds that , for large times and for @xmath99 , the time derivatives on the left hand sides can be neglected .",
    "furthermore , the right - hand sides yield meaningful equations only if @xmath93 is set to @xmath47 . the resulting equations",
    "then take the form @xmath100 where the scaling variable is @xmath101 .",
    "the boundary conditions to the above equations follow from @xmath102 and @xmath103 and from matching the solutions to the ones found on the diffusive scale @xmath104 equations ( [ phia],[phib ] ) with boundary conditions ( [ phibounda],[phiboundb ] ) , however , pose a difficulty related to the fact that the combination @xmath105 satisfies a linear equation @xmath106 and the solution , @xmath107 , contains a integration constant , @xmath108 , which is not determined by the boundary conditions .",
    "consequently , the scaling functions do not appear to be unique .",
    "this problem of uniqueness can be dealt with by returning to the diffusive scale , @xmath98 , and reexamining the solutions found there .",
    "we shall demonstrate the idea on the example of a system where @xmath109 ( and @xmath110 since we are at criticality ) .",
    "in this case , @xmath111 satisfies the diffusion equation for both @xmath24 and @xmath28 , the boundary conditions are given by @xmath112 and @xmath113 and , furthermore , the initial condition [ @xmath114 ; @xmath115 is an odd function of @xmath31 .",
    "it follows then that the solution is an odd function , @xmath116 .",
    "next we note that @xmath117 for @xmath28 while @xmath111 for @xmath24 and approaching @xmath53 from both sides , the oddness of @xmath118 yields the following relationship @xmath119 since there is no accumulation of @xmath2 particles at @xmath53 , we have @xmath120 and , consequently , @xmath19 is continuous function across the membrane , @xmath121",
    ". then equation ( [ boundvalues ] ) yields @xmath122 which , in turn , provides an additional boundary condition for the scaling functions : @xmath123 the same extra boundary condition can also be found for @xmath124 but the argument is rather involved , so we shall not reproduce it here . from the perspective of critical phenomena",
    ", it is quite natural that the scaling function does not depend on such details as the diffusion coefficients .    having the extra boundary condition ( [ scboundvalues ] ) , @xmath91 and @xmath92",
    "can now be found numerically .",
    "some properties of the scaling functions can , however , be seen by just inspecting the equations .",
    "for example , substituting the large @xmath125 asymptotics @xmath126 into ( [ phia ] ) , one can see that @xmath127 is given by the airy function @xcite .    on fig.[fig7 ] , we show that the scaling regime does exist and that the numerical results do agree with the solution of the full equations ( [ a2],[b2 ] ) .",
    "it follows then from ( [ phia],[phib ] ) that the production rate can also be written in a scaling form @xmath128 and we can observe that the reaction front remains attached to the wall but it expands with time into the @xmath24 region . both the center and the width of the zone diverge with time as @xmath129 and both exponents are the same in contrast to the delocalized phase where @xmath130 and @xmath13 .",
    "the above discussion is based on a mean - field like treatment and one can ask what is the role of the fluctuations which are supposed to be important in low dimensions .",
    "numerical simulations carried out for an one- and two - dimensional systems with semipermeable wall  @xcite indicate that the mean field description discussed above remains qualitatively correct .",
    "the upper critical dimension above which the mean field theory is correct appears to be @xmath131 .",
    "however , in dimension @xmath132 , the critical exponents takes their non mean field values  @xcite . for example , the mean position and width exponents at the critical point change from the mean field value @xmath47 to @xmath133 .",
    "we can now summarize the properties of the localization - delocalization transition discussed above as follows . for @xmath14",
    ", the reaction zone is localized at the membrane and the width is determined by the correlation length , @xmath54 , describing the penetration of the a particles into the constant - density @xmath3 region . at @xmath15 the penetration length diverges but there is still a single ( diverging with time ) length which characterizes the reaction zone . it should be noted that a diverging diffusion length @xmath134 is always present but it is irrelevant for @xmath135 . for @xmath11 , however , the diffusion length starts to play a role : the reaction zone gets delocalized and two distinct lengthscales appear .",
    "one of them is the distance of the center of the zone from the membrane , @xmath136 , which is just the diffusion length while the other is the width of the reaction zone , @xmath13 .",
    "the questions of how much @xmath32 is produced near the membrane and whether their density , @xmath137 , grows to exceed some aggregation threshold , @xmath138 , may be of importance in biological phenomena ( e.g. in the building of rather intricate but regular mineral skeletons of single - cell organisms such as radiolaria  @xcite or diatoms  @xcite ) .",
    "the answers to the above questions depend on the localization properties of the reaction zone .    for @xmath14",
    ", the reaction zone has a finite width and thus , provided the @xmath32-s do not diffuse away , their density will increase with time as @xmath139 .",
    "this result follows from the fact that the current , @xmath140 , of @xmath2 particles towards the reaction zone is proportional to @xmath83 and , consequently , the amount of @xmath32-s , produced up to time @xmath141 , is given by @xmath142 .",
    "a somewhat slower increase of @xmath143 takes place at @xmath15 .",
    "since the width of the reaction zone diverges as @xmath13 , one finds @xmath144 .",
    "we can see that , for both @xmath145 and @xmath15 , the density of @xmath32-s near the membrane exceeds any threshold @xmath138 at sufficiently large times . thus supersaturation and ,",
    "associated with it , the precipitation of @xmath32 may occur in these regimes .    finally , for @xmath11 , the reaction zone leaves the membrane and only a finite density of @xmath32-s left behind .",
    "the actual value of this density depends sensitively on the initial conditions and one can not make statements about possible precipitation without knowledge of the actual parameters .",
    "the above considerations , of course , do not constitute an attempt towards the explanation of a real biological phenomena such as the precipitation of the siliceous stuctures of single - cell radiolaria .",
    "this is so even if one imagines that , at the early stages of the evolution , the regular skeletons are either produced as an instability in a physico - chemical , reaction - diffusion process or arose by surface - tension assisted precipitation where the membranes are present but play a passive role ( their intersections defines the precipitation regions )  @xcite . at present stage of evolution ,",
    "the skeletons are covered with a membranous cytoplasmic sheat which appears to play an important role ( e.g. transport along the membrane ) in the skeletal depositions@xcite .",
    "thus any attempt at _ physico - chemical _ explanation should include the presence of such an _ active _ membrane near the precipitation zone .    in this paper , we have derived results for the properties of reaction zones near a semipermeable membrane which is _ active _ only in the sense that it is blocking the transport of one of the reagents .",
    "we hope , however , that our results will help discussing more complicated reactions near _ active _ membranes in the same way as the understanding of the properties of the reaction zone  @xcite in the @xmath16 reaction helped in elucidating the features of the pattern formation in the much more complicated liesegang phenomena  @xcite .",
