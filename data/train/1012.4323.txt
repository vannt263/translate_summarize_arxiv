    "due to numerous experimental results coming from babar and belle , there is presently great interest in decays of @xmath6-mesons .",
    "lhc will also provide us with more data for such processes .",
    "@xmath6-decays of the type @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where the energy release is big compared to the light meson masses ( heavy to light transitions ) , has been treated within _ qcd factorization _ @xcite and _ soft collinear effective theory _ ( scet ) @xcite . in the high energy limit ,",
    "the amplitudes for such decay modes factorize into products of two matrix elements of weak currents , and some nonfactorizable corrections of order @xmath9 can be calculated perturbatively .",
    "however , there are additional contributions of order @xmath5 which can not be reliably calculated within perturbative theory @xcite .",
    "the so called pqcd - model and qcd sum rules have also been used for @xmath6-meson decays @xcite .    for decay modes which are of the heavy to heavy type , involving @xmath3- and @xmath10-quarks ,",
    "the decay amplitudes have been described within _ heavy quark effective field theory _ ( hqeft ) @xcite .",
    "some transitions of _ heavy to heavy _ type in the heavy quark limits @xmath11 like @xmath12 mixing @xcite has been studied within _ heavy light chiral perturbation theory _ ( hl@xmath13pt ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , other transitions which are formally _ heavy to heavy _ in the heavy quark limits @xmath14 _ and _ @xmath15 , like the isgur - wise function @xcite for @xmath16 , have been studied within hl@xmath13pt @xcite .",
    "the cases @xmath17 @xcite and @xmath18 @xcite have also been studied within such a framework , even if the energy release in these processes is above the chiral symmetry breaking scale .",
    "still this framework give amplitudes of the right order of magnitude .",
    "the calculation of such transitions have in addition been supplemented with calculations within a _ heavy light chiral quark model _",
    "( hl@xmath13qm ) to determine quantities which are not determined within hl@xmath13pt itself @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in a series of papers @xcite , there are processes which have factorized amplitudes multiplied by a very small wilson coefficient combination , such that nonfactorized amplitudes are expected to dominate .",
    "examples are @xmath19 @xcite , @xmath20 @xcite and @xmath21 . the latter process",
    "@xmath21 was considered recently @xcite . in that case a heavy @xmath3-quark decaying to a light , but energetic quark was involved . then the light energetic quark might be described by an effective theory .",
    "the first version of such a framework was _ large energy effective theory _",
    "( leet ) @xcite .",
    "the hqeft covers processes where the heavy quarks carry the main part of the momentum in each hadron .",
    "to describe processes where energetic light quarks emerge from decays of heavy @xmath3-quarks , leet was introduced @xcite and used to study the current for @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the idea was that leet should do for energetic light quarks what hqeft did for heavy quarks .",
    "in hqeft one splits off the heavy motion from the full heavy quark field , thus obtaining a reduced field depending on the velocity of the heavy quark .",
    "similarly , in leet one splits off the large energy from the full field of the energetic light quark , thus obtaining an effective description for a reduced light quark which depends on a light - like four vector .",
    "it was later shown that leet in its initial formulation was incomplete and did not fully reproduce qcd physics @xcite .",
    "then leet was further developed to be fully consistent with qcd and became the soft collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite .    in the present paper we consider decay modes of the type @xmath23 .",
    "the decay mode @xmath24 has a substantial factorized amplitude , given by the current matrix element for @xmath25 transition times the matrix element of the weak current for the outgoing @xmath26 , which is proportional to the pion decay constant @xmath27 .",
    "the relevant wilson coefficient is also the maximum possible , namely of order one times the relevant cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing factors and the fermi coupling constant .",
    "this is in contrast to the process @xmath28 which is color suppressed .",
    "as said above , decays of the type @xmath29 have been extensively studied within qcd - factorization , scet , and qcd sum rule methods @xcite . in spite of tremendous efforts it has not been possible to obtain an amplitude compatible with the experimental result @xmath28 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is study this decay mode within an alternative model dependent framework .",
    "first we point out that the factorized contribution to the decay mode @xmath28 , which is given by the @xmath22 transition amplitude times the decay constant of the @xmath30 meson , is almost zero because it is proportional to a very small wilson coefficient combination . for the dominant nonfactorizable ( color suppressed ) amplitude for @xmath28 we will , as mentioned above , use a model named _ large energy chiral quark model _ ( le@xmath13qm ) recently constructed and used to handle the process @xmath31 @xcite . here a variant of leet was combined with ideas from previous chiral quark model ( @xmath13qm ) calculations similarly to what has been done for other nonleptonic decays @xcite .    a priori it might look strange to use the framework of chiral quark models when the energy release is big compared to the chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath32 .",
    "the point is that the motion of the heavy quark or energetic light quark can be split off , and the various versions of heavy - light or large energy chiral quark models and a corresponding chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath33 ) can be used to describe the redundant strong interactions corresponding to momenta of order 1 gev and below .",
    "it might be argued that we should have used the full scet theory as the basis our new model .",
    "however , the purpose of our paper is to estimate , in analogy with previous papers @xcite , the effects of soft gluon emission in terms of gluon condensates , where transverse quark momenta and collinear gluons will not play an essential role . in any case",
    "this construction @xcite will be a model .",
    "therefore it suffices for our purpose to use the more simple formulation of leet .",
    "we will combine leet with chiral quark models ( @xmath13qm ) @xcite , containing only soft gluons making condensates .",
    "in le@xmath13qm @xcite an energetic quark is bound to a soft quark with an a priori unknown coupling , as proposed in @xcite .",
    "the unknown coupling is determined by calculating the known @xmath22 current matrix element within the model @xcite .",
    "this fixes the unknown coupling because the matrix element of this current is known @xcite .",
    "then , in the next step , we use this coupling to calculate the nonfactorized ( color suppressed ) amplitude contribution to @xmath28 in terms of the lowest dimension gluon condensate , as have been done for other nonleptonic decays @xcite .",
    "after the quarks have been integrated out , we obtain an effective theory containing soft light mesons as in hl@xmath13pt , but also fields describing energetic light mesons .",
    "a similar idea with a combination of scet with hl@xmath13pt is considered in @xcite .",
    "the le@xmath13qm was constructed in analogy with the previous _ heavy light chiral quark model _ ( hl@xmath13qm)@xcite and may be considered to be an extension of that model .",
    "one might think that to be completely consistent , we should also have calculated the wilson coefficients within a relevant large energy framework .",
    "for this purpose the use of leet would be dubious because it is an incomplete theory as mentioned above .",
    "however , as we will see below , the main uncertainty in our final amplitude will be due to uncertainty in our model dependent gluon condensate due to emission of soft gluons .",
    "therefore the wilson coefficients calculated within full qcd as in @xcite will be appropriate for our purpose .    in the next section ( ii )",
    "we present the weak four quark lagrangian and its factorized and nonfactorizable matrix elements . in section iii we present our version of leet , and in section iv we present the new model le@xmath13qm to include energetic light quarks and mesons . in section v we calculate the nonfactorizable matrix elements due to soft gluons expressed through the ( model dependent ) quark condensate . in section",
    "vi we give the results and conclusion .",
    "we will study decays of @xmath34 generated by the weak quark process @xmath35 . we restrict ourselves to processes where the @xmath3-quark decays .",
    "this means the quark level processes @xmath36 .",
    "processes where the anti- @xmath3-quark decays proceed analogously .",

    "these effects are handled in terms of the _ renormalization group equations _",

    "thus , the decay mode @xmath60 has a sizeable factorized amplitude proportional to @xmath58 .",
    "in contrast , the decay mode @xmath61 has a factorized amplitude proportional to the nonfavorable coefficient @xmath59 which is close to zero . in this case",
    "we expect the nonfactorizable term ( involving colour matrices ) proportional to @xmath54 to be dominant , i.e. the last line of eq .",
    "( [ bdpinonfact ] ) dominates .",
    "a substantial part of this paper is dedicated to the calculation of this nonfactorizable contribution to the @xmath62 decay amplitude .",

    "this matrix element will be estimated in section  v where we use the le@xmath13qm to estimate nonfactorizable amplitudes in terms of emission of soft gluons making gluon condensates .",
    "an energetic light quark might , similarly to a heavy quark , carry practically all the energy @xmath66 of the meson it is a part of .",
    "the difference is that now the mass of the energetic quark is close to zero compared to the heavy quark mass @xmath67 and @xmath66 , which are assumed to be of the same order of magnitude .",
    "we assume that the energetic light quark is emerging from the decay of a heavy quark @xmath68 with momentum @xmath69 .",
    "the heavy quark is described by the hqeft lagrangian for the reduced quark field @xmath70 @xcite : @xmath71 where @xmath70 is the reduced heavy quark field ( often named @xmath72 in the literature ) , @xmath73 its four velocity and @xmath67 the mass of the heavy quark .",

    "there will be terms of second order in @xmath241 , which are of order @xmath242 .",
    "such contributions have to be considered together with higher order ( in @xmath65 ) terms obtained from the interaction given by the operator @xmath99 in ( [ eq : leetdelta - lag ] ) .",
    "one should note that the colored current given by ( [ eq : d0cur ] ) and ( [ eq : d0 ] ) is determined by a triangle diagram .",

    "the measured branching ratios for @xmath283 and @xmath62 are @xmath284 and @xmath285 , respectively @xcite . in order to predict the experimental value solely with the mechanism considered in this section , we should have @xmath286 .",
    "numerically , we use @xmath287 @xcite . in previous papers on the heavy - light chiral quark model constituent masses @xmath288 220 mev and",
    "@xmath289 315 mev has been used . from the plot of @xmath277 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bpipi - plot ] , we observe that the experimental value of @xmath277 can easily be accomodated by values of such orders .",
    "the bad news is that in our case the value of @xmath290 and thereby @xmath275 and @xmath277 is very sensitive to the explicit choice of @xmath112 and @xmath235 .",
    "thus fine - tuning has to be used .",
    "we also find that the perturbative anomaly tail will numerically reproduce the amplitude for @xmath291 , corresponding to a quark mass @xmath292 11 mev , i.e. of same order of magnitude as typical current quark masses .",
    "using a hybrid description with a quark model with constituent quark masses for the colored @xmath293 current in ( [ eq : m1])-([eq : htom4 ] ) , and the anomaly tail description @xcite for the colored @xmath30 current in ( [ eq : m2 ] ) , ( [ eq : d0cur ] and ( [ eq : d0 ] ) is not preferrable .",
    "also , such a hybrid description also fails to show the behaviour @xmath5 required by qcd - factorization .",
    "still it might be interesting that we can numerically match the colored current for outgoing @xmath30 with the anomaly tail description . .",
    "note that there are also mesonic loop contributions similar to those contributing to processes of the type @xmath294 and @xmath295 @xcite . for those processes intermediate @xmath296 mesons contributed .",
    "in the present case the analogous contributions would involve energetic vector mesons @xmath297 , and we would need the amplitudes for @xmath298 .",
    "such loops are shown in fig .",

    "the diagram to the right would be calculable within an extended theory involving energetic vector mesons .",
    "unfortunately while the diagram to the left would be dubious because typical loop momenta would significantly exceed 1 gev , and would require insertion of ad hoc form factors or should be handled within dispersion relation techniques .",
    "both diagrams would of course require knowledge of the @xmath299 coupling in fig .",
    "[ fig : meson - loops ] . in any case",
    "such calculations are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have pointed out that the factorized amplitude for process @xmath300 is proportional to a wilson coefficient combination close to zero .",
    "thus the nonfactorizable contributions dominate the amplitude for this decay mode . to handle the nonfactorizable contributions we have extended previous chiral quark models for the pure light quark case@xcite used in @xcite , and the heavy light case@xcite used in @xcite , to include also energetic light quarks .",
    "we have found that within our model we can account for the amplitude needed to explain the experimental branching ratio for @xmath300 @xcite .",
    "in addition the ratio @xmath277 between the non - factorizable and factorized amplitude scales as @xmath5 in agreement with qcd factorization @xcite .",
