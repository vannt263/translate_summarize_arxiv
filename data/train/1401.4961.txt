    "the possibility of trapping chains of atoms @xcite and wigner crystals @xcite in an optical cavity provides a new platform to study quantum optomechanics @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this system compared to other optomechanical platforms ( i.e. , micro- and nanometer scale mechanical oscillators ) is the access to internal atomic degrees of freedom that can be used to tune the coupling and to manipulate the mechanical modes .",
    "the cavity does not only provide tailored photonic modes to interact with the atomic mechanical modes , it also alters the radiative properties of atoms giving rise to cavity mediated atom - atom interactions and collective effects . the combination of these ingredients results in a high degree of control of the optomechanical interface which has allowed , for example , the experimental observation of cavity nonlinear dynamics at a single photon level @xcite and ponderomotive squeezing of light @xcite .",
    "such a platform , in which the optomechanical system includes multiple mechanical oscillators in the quantum regime globally coupled to the cavity field , shall eventually allow multipartite entanglement of distant atom motion @xcite , hybrid light - motion entanglement @xcite , @xcite and also engineering of spin - phonon coupling mediated by light when considering the atomic internal degrees of freedom .",
    "an important problem on the way to reach the quantum optomechanical regime , is the cooling of the atomic mechanical modes to the ground state .",
    "several techniques can be envisaged to prepare an atomic chain in the ground state of motion .",
    "one way is to prepare the atoms in the ground state of an optical lattice prior to coupling them to the cavity field .",
    "sidebandanalysed resolved laser cooling can be used in this case @xcite , but the implementation of raman sideband cooling is restricted to atomic species with a suitable cycling transition .",
    "another route , very powerful and experimentally convenient , is to use the cavity mode itself for cooling the atomic chain .",
    "it eliminates the need for additional preparation steps and allows reusing the same atoms multiple times .",
    "moreover , it is not restricted to specific atomic species and can be potentially extended to the cooling of any polarizable object such as , for example , molecules @xcite . while the problem of cooling a single trapped particle in a cavity was explored theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite , the simultaneous cooling of many particles forming an array poses the question of scalability .",
    "cooling of an atomic array using a cavity mode was experimentally demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite where a single mode of the collective atomic motion was cooled close to the ground stare .",
    "the cooling rate of this unique collective mode was found to be proportional to the number of atoms in the array .",
    "a similar scaling was reported in a theoretical work for the case when a homogeneous cloud is first organized by the cavity potential and than collectively cooled @xcite .",
    "a number of questions remain open on the protocol to cool down an array of atoms to the ground state inside a cavity .",
    "what is the role of the collective modes in the cooling dynamics of individual atoms ?",
    "how do the cooling rates of individual atoms scale with the number of atoms in the array ? what is the role of the lattice periodicity _ vs _ the cavity mode period ? what is the most efficient cooling scheme ?",
    "this work provides the answers to these questions .",
    "it shows that ( i ) cooling of a single collective mode is faster than the cooling of individual atoms , which is destructively suppresed due to collective effects , ( ii ) the cooling time for individual atoms increases non - linearly with the atom number , and ( iii ) the periodicity of the array plays a key role in the dynamics which can be used to optimize the cooling performance .",
    "additionally it considers the limitations imposed by the spontaneous estimate outside of the cavity mode and shows the experimental feasibility of the cavity cooling of tens of atoms in the array .    in order to address these questions",
    ", a theoretical model is developed describing the general configuration in which the cavity potential and the atomic array have different periodicity as , for example , implemented in ref .",
    "the key factor insuring the ground state cooling of all atoms via global coupling to the single cavity mode is found to be the mechanical inhomogeneity of the traps .",
    "the cavity mode itself is demonstrated to provide the nesessary inhomogeneity due to the effect of the cavity potential on the individual traps .",
    "this controlability makes the configuration of an atomic array coupled to the cavity with different periodicity an attractive platform for further investigation of a multimode quantum optomethanical interface .",
    "additionally , the proposed cavity cooling scheme can be extended to the case of an array of micro- or nanometer scale mechanical oscillators , where strong optomechanical coupling was recently predicted @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec_model ] summarizes the theoretical model and describes the physical mechanisms governing the cooling dynamics . in section [ sec_anal_res ]",
    "we present the analytical results for the scaling of the cooling rates with the atom number .",
    "section [ sec_num_res ] compares numerical and analytical results for the cooling rates and the steady state mean phonon number per atom .",
    "the transition between two distinct regimes , when atoms interact independently or collectively with the cavity field , is reported .",
    "also the destructive suppression of the cooling due to collective effects is demonstrated . in section [ sec_optimization ]",
    "the role of the lattice periodicity _ vs _ the cavity mode period is discussed and a possible way to speed up the cooling is suggested .",
    "finally the effect of the spontaneous emission on the scaling of the steady state phonon number is analysed in section [ sec_spont_em ] together with the experimental feasibility of the proposed cooling scheme .",
    "the conclusions are drawn in section [ sec_conclusion ] .",
    "the system under investigation consists of two elements : ( i ) a one dimensional array of @xmath0 independently trapped atoms coupled to ( ii ) a quantum light field with wave number @xmath1 confined inside an optical cavity pumped by a monomode laser as presented in figure [ fig_schema ] .",
    "the chain of two - level atoms is formed along the axis of the cavity where the atoms are confined in a deep optical lattice potential generated by an additional external classical field @xcite .",
    "the case of hopping and tunnelling of atoms between the different sites will be neglected .",
    "the trap array holding the neutral atoms may be experimentally implemented in various ways . in the works",
    "@xcite an extra cavity pump field resonant to the other cavity frequency was used to create a deep optical lattice .",
    "alternatively , an optical lattice along the cavity can be created by two laser beams crossing each other at an angle inside the cavity or with the use of a spatial light modulator .",
    "although the focus of this work is on the cooling of neutral atoms it is worth noticing that the generalization of the model for the case of of ions or other polarizable particles can be straightforwardly done .",
    "individually trapped atoms are placed inside a cavity with resonant frequency @xmath2 and decay rate @xmath3 .",
    "atoms have identical two - level structure and a resonance frequency @xmath4 .",
    "the cavity is pumped by an external laser , detuned by @xmath5 from the cavity resonance frequency and by @xmath6 from the atomic transition frequency . ]    the main mechanism behind the cavity cooling is the scattering process taking place when an atom absorbs a photon with pump frequency @xmath7 and then emits a photon back into the cavity with frequency @xmath8 .",
    "if the pump frequency is lower than the cavity resonance frequency ( @xmath9 ) and the difference is equal to the atomic trap frequency @xmath10 , the atom will lose one vibration quantum , and the photon , eventually leaving the cavity , will carry this energy away .",
    "such a cooling mechanism essentially relies on the interaction of atoms with the cavity field and assumes that the spontaneous emission into free space is negligibly small .",
    "this requires the cavity - to - free space scattering ratio to be much larger than one , which is reached when the single atom cooperativity ( purcell number ) @xmath11 is larger than one , regardless of the pump filed detuning from the atomic transition @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it is achieved when a light - atom coupling strength @xmath12 is larger than the geometric average of the atomic natural linewidth @xmath13 and the cavity decay rate @xmath3 .",
    "we will focus on the regime in which the cavity field is far off - resonance from the atomic transition @xmath14 , such that the probability of an atomic excitation is negligibly small . under the conditions @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the mean photon number in the cavity , the atomic internal degree of freedom can be adiabatically eliminated . in this case",
    "the coherent part of the optomechanical interaction between the cavity and atomic motion is described by the effective hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath17 here @xmath18 and @xmath19 stands for the creation and annihilation operators of the cavity field in the rotating frame at the pump frequency @xmath7 , and @xmath20 is the cavity pumping strength .",
    "the motion of atoms with mass @xmath21 inside the traps with identical frequencies @xmath10 is described by the displacement operator @xmath22 of the @xmath23-th atom from its trap center @xmath24 .",
    "the single atom off - resonant coupling strength at the anti - node is @xmath25 .",
    "the first term in the hamiltonian contains the optomechanical interaction between the cavity field and the atomic motion : @xmath26 is the shift of the cavity frequency caused by the presence of the atoms and , conversely , the mechanical potential exerted on the atoms by a single cavity photon .",
    "further on only the lamb - dicke regime will be considered , when the atoms are localized on a length scale @xmath27 much smaller than the cavity wavelength @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is much smaller than one ) .",
    "thus only the contributions up to the second order in the lamb - dicke parameter will be considered and the approximation @xmath30 will be used .",
    "the incoherent dynamic due to the cavity decay and the spontaneous emission ( up to the second order in @xmath31 ) is captured by the following heisenberg - langevin equations : @xmath32 -(\\kappa+\\sum_{i=1}^nd_{ai}/2)\\hat{a } + \\sqrt{2\\kappa}\\hat{s}_{a } + i\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sqrt{d_{ai}}\\hat{f}_{ai } , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the noise operator @xmath34 of the vacuum field entering the cavity through the mirror has the zero mean value and its correlation functions are : @xmath35    the scattering of the cavity photons by the atoms in to the outer modes causes the langevin forces @xmath36 and @xmath37 correspond to the loss of the cavity photons with rate @xmath38 , and the diffusion of an atomic motion with rates @xmath39 respectively .",
    "they have the following non - zero correlation functions : @xmath40 here @xmath41 represents the mean cavity photon number in the zero order with respect to the lamb - dicke parameter @xmath42 .",
    "an order of unity coefficient @xmath43 depends on the atomic position along the cavity axes and on @xmath44 , which gives the angular dispersion of the atom momentum and accounts for the dipole emission pattern @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "equations ( [ h - l_equations_sp_em ] ) and correlation functions ( [ eq_cor_fun_sp_em ] ) are derived under the assumption that the inter - atomic distance @xmath46 is much larger that the cavity wavelength @xmath47 which allows one to consider atoms as independent scatterers .    in the case of a single atom , equations ( [ h - l_equations_sp_em ] )",
    "correspond to the result reported in @xcite where the rates to raise and lower the vibration quanta also compensate each other up to the second order in @xmath31 and only the diffusion effect remains .",
    "the difference with the result presented here accounts for the different pumping geometry - the atom is pumped from the side or the cavity is pumped through the mirror .    next assumption on the way to solve equations ( [ h - l_equations_sp_em ] ) is a large intracavity photon number with only small fluctuations around its steady state mean value : @xmath48 , with @xmath49 .",
    "the steady state mean values for the cavity field @xmath50 , atom displacement @xmath51 and momentum @xmath52 are the solutions of the nonlinear algebraic equations constructed by taking the mean values on the left- and right - hand sides in equations ( [ h - l_equations_sp_em ] ) and putting the derivatives to zero ( assuming that the fluctuations are small ) : @xmath53 here @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 and @xmath57 . without any loss of generality we assume @xmath50 to be real , which can be adjusted by choosing the phase of @xmath20 . in the lamb - dicke regime the cavity mean field can be seen as a power series in the lamb - dicke parameter @xmath58 with the zero order term @xmath59    the evolution of small fluctuations around the steady state mean values is well described by the linear system of equations.substituting @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 in to equations ( [ h - l_equations_sp_em ] ) and neglecting the nonlinear terms together with other terms of the same order of magnitude brings us to the following equations : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a modified trap frequency . to be consistent with the lamb - dicke approximation and to ensure that @xmath65 in equation ( [ equations_mean_steady_state ] )",
    ", the following inequality should be fulfilled : @xmath66    finally , linear equations ( [ h - l_equations_linearised ] ) allow to reconstruct the effective hamiltonian governing the dynamics of the cavity field fluctuations and atomic motion in the traps : @xmath67 this expression shows the two main effects captured by our model : the optomechanical coupling responsible for the cooling mechanism ( last term ) and the modification of the trap frequencies as a mean field effect of the cavity potential .",
    "the trap inhomogeneity is an essential ingredient for cooling atoms to the ground state of motion . as only one collective mode of motion @xmath68 couples to the cavity",
    ", the cooling mechanism takes place exclusively by removing the excitations from this mode @xcite .",
    "if the frequencies of all the traps are identical , for example when the inter - atomic distance in the array is a multiple of the cavity wavelength , this collective mode is also an eigenmode of a free atomic system .",
    "thus it will be decoupled from the remaining @xmath69 longitudinal modes of collective motion @xcite , and these modes will stay excited . as the steady state energy of each atom",
    "is determined by the weights of all the collective modes , individual atoms will be only partially cooled . alternatively , if the trap frequencies are different than the collective mode @xmath70 is no longer an eigenmode of a free atomic subsystem and it will be coupled to other @xmath69 longitudinal modes of collective atomic motion .",
    "this will allow a sympathetic cooling of all the collective modes , and all the atoms . the same principle is the basis for the sideband cooling of a trapped ion in three dimensions with a single laser beam @xcite .",
    "in that case the requirements for cooling in all three dimensions are : different oscillation frequencies along each axes and a non - zero projection of the light wave vector on all the axes .",
    "the case of a one - dimensional cooling of many particles appears analogous to the cooling of a single particle in multiple directions .",
    "similarly , in the case of an atomic array the conditions are : different trap frequencies and non - zero coupling of light to each atom .",
    "this section is devoted to the analyses of the atom - cavity evolution neglecting the effect of the spontaneous emission ( @xmath71 ) and taking in to account only the cavity decay .",
    "importantly , this simplification will not significantly effect the cooling rates in the far off - resonance regime , provided that the cavity decay is much faster than the spontaneous emission rate : @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in this regime",
    "the spontaneous emission will mainly cause a diffusion , the process in which the rate of adding and subtracting of a motion quantum are identical , and the contributions of both in to the final cooling rate cancel each other .",
    "contrary the steady state phonon number for the atoms will increase due to the diffusion process and section [ sec_spont_em ] will be devoted to this issue .",
    "direct cooling of collective mode @xmath74 and its exchange with the remaining collective modes may appear on different time scales and the slowest of them will correspond to the cooling time scale for individual atoms . this section presents the analytical limits for the cooling rates of different modes of motion and the scaling of the cooling dynamics with atom number @xmath0 .",
    "the cavity potential provides the trap inhomogeneity with a narrow distribution of the trap frequencies around @xmath10 in the lamb - dicke regime : @xmath75}$ ] . distributing the atoms such that @xmath76 , @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is any integer will correspond to the following ratio between the inter - atomic distance @xmath46 and the cavity wavelength @xmath79 : @xmath80 this configuration will simplify the calculation and will allow to find the analytical solutions for the cooling rates .",
    "more over , the results will capture the general properties of the cooling , regardless the atomic configuration .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the collective modes in the following way : first mode @xmath74 coupled to the cavity and remaining modes @xmath81 , @xmath82 , uncoupled from each other and coupled only to the first one . for the selected ratio @xmath83",

    "substituting this transformation into the effective hamiltonian ( [ hammiltonian_effective ] ) and introducing the creation and anihilation operators @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , @xmath91 we get the hamiltonian in the desired form : @xmath92 the coupling strengths @xmath93 , between the cavity and collective mode @xmath74 , and @xmath94 , between collective modes @xmath74 and @xmath81 , and the collective mode frequencies @xmath95 are : @xmath96.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus the cavity coupling to the @xmath74 mode increases with @xmath0 while the coupling between @xmath81 and @xmath74 modes decreases with @xmath0 . such an opposite dependence will lead to the emergence of separate time scales when the atom number is sufficiently large . in this case",
    "the dynamic will consist of a fast excitation subtraction from the @xmath74 mode via the exchange with the cavity followed by the cavity decay , and a slow exchange between the modes @xmath81 and @xmath74 .    to find separately the asymptotic expressions of the collective mode decay rates for the fast and slow processes for @xmath97 , at first only the interaction between cavity and @xmath74 mode",
    "is considered ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "this single mode case was considered in the work @xcite and it is analogous to the cavity cooling of a single trapped particle @xcite as well as of an eigenmode of a mechanical cantilever @xcite .",

    "spectral parameters @xmath104 stand for the subtraction ( @xmath105)/addition ( @xmath106 ) of an energy quantum from / to the collective mode of motion and refer to the cooling and heating processes respectively .",

    "efficient cooling of collective mode @xmath74 will occur at the cooling side - band @xmath109 and in the resolved side - band regime @xmath110 . in this case @xmath111 and @xmath112 and the contribution of the heating processes is negligible .",
    "the cooling rate is then @xmath113 while the mean phonon number @xmath114 is close to zero . assuming this regime",
    ", we now consider the evolution of the remaining modes . if the exchange between modes @xmath74 and @xmath81 occurs at the time scale much slower than @xmath115 , mode @xmath74 will serve as a decay channel for the remaining modes",
    ".    we will look for the cooling rate for each @xmath81 mode independently , assuming that the effect of the presence of modes @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) , can be neglected for sufficiently large @xmath0 .",
    "we shall note that the condition similar to the one providing the resolved side - band regime is automatically fulfilled : the decay rate of mode @xmath74 is much smaller that the frequency of the @xmath23-th mode @xmath118 .",
    "also the condition similar to the cooling side - band condition is fulfilled for each mode , @xmath119 for sufficiently large atom number @xmath120 .",
    "the independent cooling rate for the @xmath81 mode in this resolved side - band regime is well approximated by the following expression : @xmath121 in the derivation of the rate equation for the mean phonon number in mode @xmath81 , the counter - rotating terms @xmath122 and @xmath123 in the hamiltonian were neglected ( rotating wave approximation ) .",
    "then , in the frame rotating with frequency @xmath10 , the cavity mode @xmath124 and collective mode @xmath125 were subsequently eliminated to get the heisenberg - langevin equation for the @xmath126 mode alone .",
    "the rate equation for the mean phonon number in each mode was again derived by calculating the mean value @xmath127 .",
    "the rotating wave approximation allows to reconstruct only the decay term but not the steady state mean phonon number in the rate equation because the heating side - band is neglected .",
    "apart from this drawback it allows one to find the cooling rate with a good accuracy in the resolved sideband regime .",
    "expression ( [ eq_colling_rates_analitical ] ) shows a non - linear decrease of the independent cooling rates with increasing atom number . the smallest rate which will determine the cooling rate of individual atoms is @xmath128 when the atom number is much bigger than one .",
    "here we shall recall that while changing the atom number we keep the modified cavity detuning fixed to the cooling side - band @xmath109 which means that the pump frequency is adjusted for each atom number such that @xmath129 .",
    "also , the choice of the array periodicity ( [ equation_periodicity ] ) made the ratio @xmath130 dependent on @xmath0 .",
    "one should note that the cooling rates ( [ eq_colling_rates_analitical ] ) in this collective cooling regime does not really depend on the interaction strength @xmath131 , only weakly through @xmath95 .",
    "it is at first surprising , but reasonable , since the cooling is a trade - off between two processes : the exchange among different collective modes and the decay of the collective mode coupled to the cavity .",
    "these two processes are initially governed by the interaction of the same origin with strength @xmath131 .",
    "when the collective mode decay rate increases the cooling slows down because less exchange events appear on the decay time scale , this is compensated by the simultaneous growth of the exchange rate .",
    "thus the single atom interaction strength cancels out in the resulting cooling rate .",
    "this fact will crucially change the influence of the spontaneous emission on the cooling process in comparison with the single atom case which we will discuss in section [ sec_spont_em ] .",
    "the exact evolution of @xmath0 atoms coupled to the cavity mode described by hamiltonian ( [ hammiltonian_effective ] ) can not be found analytically and the cooling rates and mean phonon numbers are calculated numerically still neglecting the effect of the spontaneous emission ( @xmath71 ) .    performing the transformations @xmath132 , @xmath133 , where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are the creation and annihilation operators of a vibrational excitation for individual atoms , the system of equations ( [ h - l_equations_linearised ] ) can be rewritten in the matrix form @xmath136 here we introduced the vectors of the system fluctuations and the noise operators : @xmath137 the dynamical matrix @xmath138 is non - hermitian and its non - zero elements are @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",

    "we clearly see the dominating decay rate @xmath156 corresponding to the polaritonic modes mainly consisting of the cavity mode .",
    "consequently the remaining polaritonic modes will mostly consist of atomic modes .",
    "for sufficiently large @xmath0 the decay rates are well approximated by the analytical expressions for the collective mode decay rates @xmath146 ( blue , dashed - dotted line ) and @xmath157 ( red , dashed line for @xmath147 of figure [ fig_scaling_all_rates].a ) thus these modes are close to the collective modes introduced in the previous section .",
    "when the atom number is small , analytical results ( [ eq_colective_cooling_rate],[eq_colling_rates_analitical ] ) are no longer valid because the collective mode @xmath74 can not be treated independently from the remaining modes @xmath81 .",

    "we conclude that atoms do not feel the presence of each other and they are cooled down independently .",
    "this is due to the fact that the difference between the trap frequencies is larger than the mechanical damping rate of each atom @xmath164 and there is no interference effect between the cooling of different atoms .",
    "on the contrary , for a large atom number the frequencies @xmath165 are close to each other and when the difference becomes smaller than @xmath164 the light mediated interaction between the traps slows down the cooling .",
    "a similar interference effect was previously found for two mechanical modes of a micromirror in an optical cavity @xcite . in figure",

    "its position depends on the array geometry and is captured by @xmath166 where @xmath167 in the present configuration .",
    "the steady state mean occupation number of each atom , presented on [ fig_scaling_all_rates].b , practically does not depend on the total number of atoms if the spontaneous emission is neglected .",
    "it is approximately the same for all atoms and it is close to the lowest value achievable for a single atom resolved side - band cooling @xmath168 ( 0.0025 for the selected parameters ) when the diffusion due to spontaneous emission is negligible @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the shifts of the trap frequencies are much smaller than the cavity bandwidth and the cooling sideband conditions are still fulfilled for all the atoms .",
    "comparison of the numerical and analytical results allows us to associate the collective modes of the atomic motion presented in the previous section with the normal polaritonic modes of the full system .",
    "it also revealed the transition between two different regimes when atoms are cooled independently or collectively . comparing the smallest collective decay rate @xmath147 with the smallest independent decay rate @xmath169 for @xmath97 we see the suppression by a factor @xmath170 .",
    "thus , while the collective effects are favourable for the cooling of one mode shortening its cooling time linearly with @xmath0 @xcite , they destructively suppress the cooling of individual atoms and prolong their cooling time quadratically with n.",
    "so far we analysed the configuration when the ratio between the lattice constant and the cavity wavelength was set by expression ( [ equation_periodicity ] ) , which corresponds to the spread of the trap frequencies over the whole available interval @xmath171 .",

    "this will automatically increase the minimal coupling to the cavity .",
    "such a change can be parametrized as follows : @xmath180 here @xmath181 is the number of steps in the search for the optimal configuration . by changing the value of the optimization parameter @xmath177 from @xmath182 to @xmath183 we go from the largest to the smallest frequency spread . as an example , figure [ fig_optimization].a shows the distribution of the frequencies @xmath184 and couplings @xmath185 for nine atoms and the optimization parameter @xmath174 with @xmath175 .",
    "figure [ fig_optimization].b shows the change of the minimal cooling rate @xmath186 with @xmath177 for three different atom numbers @xmath178 . we find one order of magnitude improvement of the cooling rate as a result of the suggested optimization scheme .",
    "it is important to mention the role of the array location along the cavity axes .",
    "displacement of the array away from the optimal location will be equivalent to the rotation of the selected segment shown on figure [ fig_optimization].a around the origin .",
    "this would lead to the reduction of the cooling rate fro some atoms due to the decrease of the coupling to the cavity . additionally if some @xmath187 become identical , some collective mode of motion will decouple and consequently the steady state phonon number per atom will increase .",
    "it is experimentally convenient that the trap frequency inhomogeneity is provided by the cavity potential itself because no extra arrangements are needed to lift the trap degeneracy .",
    "additionally , the key role of the array _ vs _ cavity field periodicity may be used to speed up the cooling by a factor @xmath188 by only displacing and stretching the array along the cavity .",
    "alternatively additional external potentials can be considered to introduce an arbitrary trap inhomogeneity , however this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "up to now only the exchange between the atoms and the cavity mode was considered , and the spontaneous emission of the cavity photons by the atoms into the free space was neglected .",

    "nevertheless , we can already guess that in the individual cooling regime , when the atom number is sufficiently small , the many- and single - atom cases will be similar and here it will be proven analytically . more importantly , in this section i will also treat in detail the effect of the spontaneous emission in the collective cooling regime .",
    "we will see that the destructive suppression of the cooling rates discussed in the previous sections leads yet to another problem when accounting for the spontaneous emission : as the cooling slows down , the diffusion due to the spontaneous scattering into the free space accumulates during a longer time .",
    "this increases the steady state photon number in the traps setting an additional limitation for the proposed cooling scheme .",
    "this section presents both the numerical and analytical studies of the effect including the results derived for the first time for the considered configuration : many atoms in a pumped cavity .",

    "i.e. when the atom number is sufficiently small , we shall compare the exact solution with the analytical result for a single atom .",
    "the rate equation for the mean occupation number in @xmath23-th trap is derived by putting @xmath189 ( @xmath117 ) to zero and adiabatically eliminating the cavity mode assuming that @xmath190 .",

    "this expression clearly demonstrates the necessity of a large cooperativity @xmath195 to reach the ground state cooling .",
    "it is in agreement with the results reported in @xcite with the only difference being a numerical factor of the order of unity accounting for different pumping configuration .",
    "this result also coincides ( up to the second order in @xmath196 ) with the the result reported in @xcite , there the cavity pump configuration was also considered .",
    "it is interesting to note that the initial assumption on the intra - cavity mean photon number made in this work ( @xmath197 ) is essentially different to the one of @xcite ( @xmath198 ) .",
    "the exact agreement between the results underlines that the limit of a small intra - cavity photon number and the limit of a small fluctuation around a large inta - cavity photon number are two related approximations in the far off - resonance regime .    for the case of @xmath0 atoms inside a cavity",
    "the problem is now solved numerically and the results are compared with the a single atom case in figure [ fig_occupation number_decay_rates_sp_em ] .",
    "the scaling of the steady state phonon number with @xmath0 is presented for two different atomic configurations : the optimized configuration ( figure [ fig_occupation number_decay_rates_sp_em].a ) and the one considered in figure [ fig_scaling_all_rates ] ( figure [ fig_occupation number_decay_rates_sp_em].b ) . in agreement with the cooling rate",

    "the single atom cooperativity should obey the inequality : @xmath209 this is fundamentally different from the condition in the case of a single atom @xmath210 where @xmath211 does not enter and consequently the detuning does not play a role .",

    "as we see from ( [ ineq_cooperativity_sp_em ] ) , in the case of collective cooling the cooperativity @xmath195 is required to be larger than in a single atom , i.e. the positive effect of the cavity is corrupted by the destructive interference in the cooling dynamic .",
