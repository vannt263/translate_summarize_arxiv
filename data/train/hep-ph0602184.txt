    "since the direct experimental information about structure of susy model and values of susy particles masses are absent now we try to extract any possible data from the cosmology . from the recent wmap data @xcite the mass density in the universe is equal to its critical value @xmath1 ; the structured dark matter ( dm ) and",
    "the isotropic and homogeneous dark energy ( de ) contribute to this density @xmath2 and @xmath3 , correspondingly . as it is known , baryons give @xmath4 of the total universe s mass . in our galaxy @xmath5 of total mass",
    "is the mass of dm which forms the halo .",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particles ( lsp )  neutralino  are supposed to be the main contributors to the cold ( and hot ) dm .",
    "the physics of lsp is discussed intensively in various aspects @xcite .    to observe the neutralino appearance in space or land experiments one can use of the different ways .",
    "for example , the high energy antiprotons , positrons or neutrino flux due to neutralino annihilation in the dark halo or in the center of the sun or the earth . in our work we have concentrated on the specific gamma - radiation @xcite which can be diffuse ( due to annihilation into fermions and bosons ) or monochromatic ( due to annihilation into @xmath6 or @xmath7 @xcite ) . to measure characteristics of these specific gamma - fluxes the special experimental programs have been elaborated with space telescopes ( egret , glast ) @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "now we have from the collider experiments only low restriction for the neutralino mass @xmath8 .",
    "atlas and cms collaborations ( lhc ) will say something else only after 2007 .",
    "but the absolute stability of neutralino ( or metastability ) can not be checked in collider experiments . moreover , some details of the standard cosmological scenario , which are based on the neutralino as the cdm , should be changed if neutralino s and other superparticles characteristics do not agree with the scenario .",
    "thus we need in combined analysis of the lhc and astrophysical data to verify our ideas on cosmological and cosmogonic evolution @xcite .",
    "neutralino in our galaxy or in other galaxies up to @xmath9 at the gravity separation stage can form massive dense clumps of different sizes @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "due to the inner gravitational instability clumps can collapse and intensively annihilate .",
    "our basic supposition is that the nature and origin of the rare high - energy grb can be understood as a result of the neutralino clump total annihilation .",
    "we have shown that at the final stage of the process the powerful gamma - ray burst ( grb ) with photon energies over gev will occur . in the standard grb",
    "the energies of photons are only fractions of mev ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the specific energy and time distribution of this hard @xmath10-radiation can be related with the parameters of superparticles ( neutralino , in particular ) and give an important information on the susy model details and its compatibility with cosmology . as an interesting example we have considered the split higgsino scenario @xcite in the framework of famous split supersymmetry model @xcite and obtained the values of annihilation time of the neutralino clump , characteristic photon energies of the grb and the annihilation spectrum .",
    "consideration of neutralino as a carrier of dm mass in the universe generates questions about their evolution and about astrophysical phenomenons which prove both the existence of neutralino and the reality of the evolution process with neutralino participation .    according to high resolution cold dark matter simulations in the framework of the hierarchical principle of structure formation",
    "the large virilized halos are formed through the constant merging of smaller halos produced at earlier times .",
    "neutralino at the gravitational isolation stage @xmath9 formed dense massive clumps of different scales @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "it likes naturally that dm clumps are in the state of dynamical equilibrium as a result of compensation of own gravitational forces by forces of tidal interactions with each other . in consequence of inner instability",
    "the clump can turn into irreversible collapse state .",
    "the growth of density provides the growth of annihilation rate .",
    "so neutralino clouds become more and more intense sources of relativistic particles . at final stage of this process",
    "there is a gamma - ray burst .",
    "specific energy and time distribution of the gamma radiation are connected with neutralino parameters and give an important information about structure of the mssm and about its correspondence with cosmology .",
    "therefore our main statement consist in the nature of rare powerful cosmological gamma ray bursts is a result of the total annihilation of neutralino clumps .",
    "we have analyzed the qualitative and quantitative descriptions of this process in the spherically symmetric collapse model with two assumptions .",
    "first , annihilation products leave a clump during a time substantially smaller than the time of its macroscopic evolution . and",
    "second , an annihilating clump is spatially homogeneous and isotropic since more dense regions annihilate faster than the rest and heterogeneities are vanishing .",
    "the model , defined by equations of mass and momentum balance and the equation of non - relativistic gravitation theory , is : @xmath11    { \\displaystyle}\\frac{d}{dt}\\int \\rho_{\\chi } v_i dv = -\\int ( \\rho_{\\chi } v_i    v_k + p_{ik})ds_k - \\int \\rho_{\\chi } \\nabla_i \\phi dv - \\int    \\nu_{dis}\\rho_{\\chi } v_i dv - \\int \\frac{2({\\sigma}v)_{ann }    \\rho_{\\chi}^2}{m_{\\chi}}v_idv\\ , , \\\\[5 mm ]    { \\displaystyle}\\delta \\phi = 4\\pi g\\rho_{\\chi}\\ , , \\end{array } \\label{e1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the pressure tensor for neutralino gas .",
    "it is absent in consequence of the second assumption .",
    "last terms in the balance equations describe the momentary going away of annihilation products from the collapsing clump .",

    "this behavior explains by changing of the parameter hierarchy during the collapse .",
    "we use the convenient time scale @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the time of the maximum . since we have @xmath25 then the annihilation rate does nt depend on initial conditions and expresses through the fundamental constants only .",
    "the functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 of dimensionless time @xmath28 are shown at the fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "=    =    about 80 % of clump mass annihilates during the time @xmath29 effectively the annihilation takes place between @xmath30 ( before maximum ) and @xmath31 ( after maximum ) .",
    "such event represents as a powerful gamma - ray burst with total energy about clump mass .",
    "kinetic cross section can be parameterized in the form : @xmath32 , @xmath33  some parameter with the dimension of mass .",
    "so the decay time of collapsing neutralino clump expresses through susy parameters @xmath34 and gravitational constant but it is absolutely independent from initial density and initial velocity of clump compressing .    deeper analysis is possible only in the framework of concrete susy model .",
    "so there exits a possibility to extract of the susy parameters from observable characteristics of the bursts and to find constraints on the susy model . in the framework of split higgsino scenario @xcite the neutralino mass @xmath35",
    "is estimated from the statement that the dark matter in the universe has formed at the high symmetry phase of the cosmological plasma .",
