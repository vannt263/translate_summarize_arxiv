    "a molecular communication network @xcite consists of multiple transmitters and receivers in a fluid medium . the transmitters",
    "encode the messages by types , concentration or emission frequency of signalling molecules .",
    "the signalling molecules diffuse freely in the medium .",
    "when these signalling molecules reach the receiver , they trigger chemical reactions in the receiver to allow their presence to be detected .",
    "there are a number of reasons why the study of molecular communication networks , both natural and synthetic , are important .",
    "first , molecular communication is a fundamental ingredient of life on earth .",
    "multi - cellular organisms make extensive use of molecular communication to regulate body functions @xcite .",
    "second , synthetic molecular communication networks can be used as sensor networks for cancer detection and treatment @xcite , as well as many other applications @xcite .    an important part of the research on molecular communication networks is to understand their performance . work done in this area includes the modelling of molecular communication networks @xcite , capacity analysis @xcite , characterising the noise of transmitters , channels and receivers @xcite , and receiver design @xcite .",
    "this paper will focus on the receiver part of the network .",
    "when signalling molecules arrive at the receiver , they react , via one or more chemical reactions , to produce a number of output molecules . the number ( or counts ) of output molecules in the receiver over time is regarded as the _ output signal _ of the receiver .",
    "a way to detect the presence of signalling molecules at the receiver is to test whether the number of output molecules at the receiver is more than a threshold .",
    "however , the output signal is _ noisy _ due to the stochastic nature of diffusion and chemical reactions .",
    "an important part of performance analysis is to characterise the probability distribution , mean and variance of the receiver output signals .",
    "the aim of this paper is to characterise two different types of receiver reaction mechanisms , namely _",
    "reversible conversion _ and _ linear catalytic _ , and compare their performance .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are :    * we characterise the output signals of receivers that use reversible conversion in terms of probability distribution , mean , variance and frequency response . *",
    "we derive the mean , variance and frequency response of the output signal for receivers that use the linear catalytic reaction mechanism . *",
    "we investigate the properties of the output signals of these receivers . for reversible conversion , we find that the variance of the output signal is always smaller than the mean output signal",
    ". however , the linear catalytic reaction magnifies the noise to create an output signal whose variance is greater than the mean .",
    "we also find that , for both reaction mechanisms , an increase in mean output also leads to an increase in variance .",
    "* we show that the diffusibility of the receiver membrane ( a parameter which does not appear to have been studied in the literature ) can be used to affect the properties of the receiver output signal .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we present our modelling framework in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "this is followed by performance analysis of the two different types of receiver reaction mechanisms in sections [ sec : sol ] and [ sec : sol2 ] .",
    "section [ sec : num ] presents numerical results .",
    "related work is discussed in section [ sec : related ] . finally , section [ sec : con ] concludes the paper .",
    "this section presents a model for molecular communication networks .",
    "the model assumes the medium ( or space ) is discretised into voxels while time is continuous .",
    "features included in the model include geometric constraints , directional emissions of signalling molecules and others .",
    "in particular , we will consider two different types of receivers based on different types of chemical reactions .",
    "the proposed model will be analysed in sections [ sec : sol ] and [ sec : sol2 ] .",
    "we will present the _",
    "basic _ model in section [ sec : model_basic ] and various _ extensions _ will be discussed in section [ sec : model_ext ] .",
    "a molecular communication network consists of multiple transmitters and receivers . in this paper , we limit ourselves to one transmitter and one receiver .",
    "the model and the solution method can be readily generalised to the multiple transmitter and receiver scenario .",
    "we assume the transmitter uses one type of signalling molecules @xmath0 .",
    "generalisation to multiple types of non - interacting signalling molecules is straightforward .",
    "we model the transmission medium as a three dimensional ( 3-d ) space with dimensions @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are integral multiples of length @xmath5 .",
    "that is , there exist positive integers @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 such that @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "the 3-d volume can be partitioned into @xmath12 cubic _ voxels _ of volume @xmath13 .",
    "figure [ fig : model ] shows an arrangement with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we refer to a voxel by a triple @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are integers or by a single index @xmath20 $ ] where @xmath21 .",
    "the indices for the voxels are shown in figure [ fig : model ] .",
    "diffusion is modelled by molecules moving from one voxel to another .",
    "diffusion from a voxel to a non - neighbouring voxel is always not allowed . the diffusion from a voxel to a neighbouring voxel may or may not be allowed .",
    "this can be used to specify different modelling constraints .",
    "we use a few examples in figure [ fig : model ] to explain this :    1 .   for voxel 11 , the diffusion of signalling molecules @xmath0 is allowed in both directions , i.e. in and out of the voxel .",
    "the two - way arrows are used to indicate this .",
    "for voxel 1 , signalling molecules can only diffuse out of the voxel but not into it .",
    "this is indicated by the one - way arrows .",
    "3 .   with the exception of voxel 4 , diffusion to the outside of the medium is not allowed . for voxel 4 , diffusion to the outside of the medium",
    "is allowed for one surface as indicated by the one - way arrow .",
    "our model can be used to capture standard boundary conditions such as reflecting and absorbing boundaries .",
    "no molecules are allowed to flow in and out of voxel 8 ( the hatched voxel ) .",
    "this can be used to model shadowing effects or regions that are impermeable to the signalling molecules .",
    "the _ basic _ model assumes that the medium is homogeneous with the diffusion coefficient for @xmath0 in the medium is @xmath22 .",
    "define @xmath23 .",
    "if a molecule is allowed to diffuse from a voxel to another , it takes place at a rate of @xmath24 , i.e. within an infinitesimal time @xmath25 , the probability that a molecule diffuses to a neighbouring voxel is @xmath26 .",
    "we assume the transmitter and the receiver each occupies a distinct voxel .",
    "however , it is straightforward to generalise to the case where a transmitter or a receiver occupies multiple voxels .",
    "the transmitter ( resp . receiver ) is assumed to be located at the @xmath27-th ( @xmath28-th ) voxel , where @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) is an integer to indicate the position of the voxel . in figure",
    "[ fig : model ] , we assume voxel 1 ( dark grey ) contains the transmitter , and voxel 11 ( light grey ) contains a receiver . hence @xmath29 and @xmath30 in this example .",
    "we model a transmitter by a sequence which specifies the number of signalling molecules emitted by the transmitter at a certain time .",
    "we assume that , at time @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 ) , the transmitter emits @xmath33 signalling molecules .",
    "this means that : @xmath34 signalling molecules are added to the voxel containing the transmitter at time @xmath35 , @xmath36 signalling molecules are added at time @xmath37 etc .",
    "note that in figure [ fig : model ] , we only allow signalling molecules to leave the transmitter ( voxel 1 ) but our model can also deal with one - way or two - way flow on any surface of a voxel .",
    "when a signalling molecule @xmath0 arrives at a receiver , it may react , via one or more chemical reactions , to produce one or more _",
    "output molecules_. we assume that these reactions can only take place within a receiver voxel , and the output molecules do not leave the receiver voxel .",
    "in this paper , we consider the following two types of reactions at the receivers .    1 .   the signalling molecules @xmath0 are converted to complexes @xmath38 , reversibly , at the receiver via the reaction : @xmath39{\\text{k}_{+ } } c   \\label{cr : conversion } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are , respectively , the macroscopic rate constant for the forward and reverse reactions .",
    "we will refer to this reaction as _ reversible conversion _",
    "the output molecule is the complex @xmath38 .",
    "the signalling molecule @xmath0 acts as a catalyst to produce the output molecule @xmath42 .",
    "the molecule @xmath42 decays at a certain rate",
    ". we will refer to this type of receiver as _ linear catalytic _ or cat .",
    "the chemical formulas for cat are : @xmath43 l + e \\label{cr : cat1 }   \\\\ e & ->[\\text{f}_{- } ] \\emptyset   } \\label{cr : cat2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are macroscopic rate constants , and @xmath46 denotes a chemical species that we are not interested in .    for both rc and cat ,",
    "the output molecules are formed at a rate of @xmath47 or @xmath48 times the number of signalling molecules in the voxel . if @xmath49 and @xmath50 , then the relation between the mean number of signalling molecules in the voxel and mean number of output molecules is described by exactly the same first order ordinary differential equations for both receiver types .",
    "however , as we shall later , the behaviour of the mean and variance of the number of output molecules , for the same transmitter emission pattern , are very different for the two types of receivers .",
    "note that both rc and cat consists of _ linear reactions _ , which means the reaction rate is a linear function of the concentration of the reactants .",
    "reactions and are examples of _ monomolecular _ reactions because there is exactly one chemical species on each side of the chemical formula .",
    "it is appropriate to make a few remarks here .",
    "first , rc and cat can be used to approximate more complex reactions .",
    "for example , we show in @xcite that rc can approximate more complicated reactions such as michaelis - menten .",
    "cat reactions have been studied in @xcite as a detection mechanism .",
    "second , a receiver may consist of a chain of reactions but we know from data processing inequality @xcite that the capacity of the network is upper bounded by the output of the first reaction in the chain , therefore we limit our consideration to one reaction .",
    "we define the state of the molecular communication network as the number of signalling molecules in each voxel , the number of complexes in the receiver and the total number of molecules that have left or degraded in the network .",
    "let @xmath51 be the number of signalling molecules in voxel with index @xmath52 at time @xmath53 , @xmath54 be the number of signalling molecules that have either left the medium or degraded by time @xmath53 and @xmath55 be the number of output molecules in the receiver at time @xmath53 .",
    "also let @xmath56 be the total number of voxels in the medium .",
    "the state @xmath57 of the network is defined as : @xmath58^t \\label{eqn : state}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the superscript @xmath59 is used to denote matrix transpose .",
    "note that we also use @xmath27 and its subscripted form @xmath60 to indicate the index of the transmitter voxel .",
    "although the same symbol @xmath27 is used in different situations , its meaning can easily be deduced from its context .",
    "we use the network depicted in figure [ fig : model ] as an example .",
    "the unfilled and solid circles represent , respectively , signalling and output molecules .",
    "the state vector @xmath61 has 5 non - zero elements : @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "all other elements of @xmath61 are zero .",
    "note that , for @xmath67 , the @xmath68-th element of @xmath61 is the number of signalling molecules in the @xmath68-th voxel .",
    "a convenient way to represent the emission of molecules by the transmitter is to use the following notation : assume that at time @xmath53 , @xmath69 molecules are emitted by the transmitter , which is located at the @xmath27-th voxel , we can write : @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are just before and after time @xmath53 , and @xmath73 is the @xmath27-th standard basis vector .",
    "for this reason , we also include unreachable voxels , such as voxel 6 in figure [ fig : model ] , in @xmath61 to simplify notation .",
    "the state @xmath61 is in fact a vector - valued random process .",
    "the state evolves because of diffusion and reactions .",
    "we show in @xcite and @xcite that the probability distribution of @xmath61 evolves according to a reaction - diffusion master equation with exogenous input ( rdmex ) , which is a generalisation of the reaction - diffusion master equation ( rdme ) taking into consideration the emission of signalling molecules by the transmitters . in @xcite , we show how the mean of @xmath61 can be calculated for an infinite transmission medium . in @xcite , we show how the covariance of @xmath61 can be approximately calculated for an infinite medium .",
    "we will derive the probability distribution of @xmath61 for rc receivers in section [ sec : sol ] .",
    "for cat receivers , we derive the mean and variance of the number of output molecules in section [ sec : sol2 ] .      [",
    "sec : ext ] in this section , we present a number of extensions to the basic model presented earlier .",
    "the solution method in sections [ sec : sol ] and [ sec : sol2 ] can still be applied to these extensions .    1 .",
    "we assume that each voxel has the shape of a cube .",
    "it is possible to use other shapes for the voxel too .",
    "however , the rate of diffusion has to be appropriately adjusted according to the geometry , see @xcite on how this can be done .",
    "we assume a homogenous medium . an heterogeneous medium with different diffusion constants at different surfaces of the voxels can easily be incorporated",
    ". we will consider in later section how heterogeneity can be used to improve the communication performance .",
    "we assume that no flows exist in the medium .",
    "flows can be easy incorporated by adjusting the rate of flow to neighbouring voxels .",
    "for example , let us assume there is a flow in the positive @xmath17 directions of speed @xmath74 , then the rate of flow of molecules from a voxel to its neighbour in the positive @xmath17 direction should be changed to @xmath75 .",
    "4 .   degradation of signalling molecules in the voxels can also be handled , in fact in the same way as a molecule leaving the medium .",
    "multiple transmitters and multiple receivers can be used .",
    "6 .   instead of assuming",
    "the number of molecules emitted by the transmitter at a time instance is deterministic , a stochastic emission model can also be handled .",
    "in this section , we solve for the probability distribution of the state @xmath61 of a network consisting of one transmitter and one rc receiver .",
    "the solution uses the method introduced in @xcite for solving a system of monomolecular reactions .",
    "the reactions in the rc receiver are certainly monomolecular .",
    "the diffusion of signalling molecules between the voxels can be viewed as monomolecular reactions if we identify the signalling molecules in each voxel as a distinct chemical species .",
    "therefore , we can view our network as a system of monomolecular reactions .",
    "note that the work in @xcite does _ not _ consider transmitters .",
    "our contribution is to extend the method in @xcite so that it can used to analyse the performance of molecular communication networks .",
    "an important result for a system of monomolecular reactions is that each molecule evolves * independently * @xcite .",
    "this means we can analyse one molecule at a time and  sum \" the results up .",
    "we begin with some background .",
    "this section is divided into two parts .",
    "we first consider markov chains with one molecule and then we present some background on multinomial distributions .",
    "since each molecule in a rc receiver network evolves independently , we present a _ continuous - time _ markov chain representation of such networks with only _",
    "one _ molecule .",
    "if there is only one molecule in the network , the molecule can be a signalling molecule in a voxel , in an absorbing state or as a complex in the receiver .",
    "we will refer to this markov chain as the single - molecule markov chain associated with the network or 1-mc for short .",
    "the easiest way to describe 1-mc is via an example . for the network depicted in figure [ fig : model ] ,",
    "the corresponding 1-mc is depicted in figure [ fig : mc ] . in the figure ,",
    "each circle is a state of the markov chain .",
    "each state is labelled by @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) , @xmath78 or @xmath28 .",
    "the molecule is in state @xmath76 if it is a signalling molecule in voxel @xmath68 . if the molecule in state @xmath78 , the molecule has either left the medium or degraded , and is in an absorbing state . if the molecule is in @xmath28 , then it is a complex in the receiver .",
    "all the state transitions given in solid lines are due to diffusion and occur at a rate of @xmath24 for the basic model which assumes homogeneous medium .",
    "these rates are not indicated in the figure to avoid cluttering .",
    "the conversion rates ( @xmath79 and @xmath41 ) between a signalling molecule and a complex in a receiver are shown in the diagram .",
    "we will order the states of the 1-mc in the same order as that in the network state vector @xmath61 in equation .",
    "let @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 be the probability that the molecule is , respectively , a signalling molecule in @xmath68-th voxel , in absorbing state and in the receiver as a complex . define the state probability vector @xmath83 as : @xmath84^t \\label{eqn : qvec}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the probability vector @xmath83 of 1-mc evolves according to : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the infinitesimal generator of the 1-mc .",
    "the matrix @xmath86 can be transcribed from the state transition diagram such as figure [ fig : mc ] . note that , when there is only one molecule in the network , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the states in the 1-mc and the network state @xmath61 .",
    "in particular , if the molecule is in the @xmath87-th state of the 1-mc at time @xmath53 , then @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "we will make extensive use of multinomial distributions .",

    "note that in the above expression , we assume that @xmath99 .",
    "a standard result that we will make use of is that the marginalization of a multinomial distribution is again a multinomial distribution .",

    "we have the following theorem on the probability distribution of the state @xmath61 .",
    "consider a network with a transmitter and a rc receiver .",
    "the initial network state @xmath61 is zero .",

    "[ thm : rc ]    * proof : * we will establish the result step by step .",
    "let us assume that the transmitter emits only once , and this takes place at time @xmath35 and the number of molecules emitted is @xmath34 .",
    "since the network state is zero initially , it means the network state remains zero until time @xmath35 . at this time , @xmath115 which means @xmath34 molecules in the transmitter voxel .",
    "since the network can be viewed as a collection of monomolecular reactions , we can now apply ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 1 ) to show that the network state @xmath106 is @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the solution to .",
    "note that the time shift is needed in the multinomial distribution because the signalling molecules are emitted at time @xmath35 .",
    "let us now assume that the transmitter emits only twice : @xmath118 and @xmath119 molecules at , respectively , time @xmath35 and @xmath37 .",
    "since the network consists of a collection of monomolecular reactions , the molecules in the network evolves independently .",
    "we can consider the @xmath34 molecules emitted at time @xmath120 separately from those @xmath36 molecules emitted at time @xmath121 .",
    "let @xmath122 and @xmath123 denote the network state of the molecules emitted at time @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "following on from the result in the last paragraph , the probability distributions of these two state vectors are respectively @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the network state @xmath61 is the sum of two independent random variables @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , the probability distribution for @xmath61 is the convolution of the distributions of @xmath122 and @xmath123 . in other words , the probability",
    "that @xmath106 is : @xmath127 equation is obtained by repeating the above argument .",
    "we remark that : ( 1 ) theorem [ thm : rc ] can also be proved by substituting the result into the rdmex ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation 4 ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation 9 ) , but such proof would be tedious and un - intuitive ; ( 2 ) the above results can be extended to non - zero initial condition , multiple transmitters , multiple receivers and non - deterministic emission patterns of transmitters .",
    "let @xmath128 denote the number of output molecules in the rc receiver at time @xmath53 .",
    "note that @xmath128 is a random process .",
    "the probability distribution of @xmath128 can be obtained by marginalising over the first @xmath129 elements of @xmath61 given in theorem [ thm : rc ] .",
    "since marginalization of a multinomial distribution is again multinomial , and marginalization and convolution are interchangeable , we have the probability that @xmath130 is @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the element in @xmath83 related to the output molecule , see . from the discussion in section",
