    "the objects were observed at torun observatory as a part of the , , targets of opportunity  project .",
    "spectroscopic and photometric observations were obtained between 2006 and 2008 .",
    "the photometric data were collected using the 60 cm cassegrain telescope and 60/90 cm schmidt camera .",
    "the telescopes are equiped respectively with the ccd sbig stl-1001e and stl-11000 m cameras .",
    "we also used the data from _ savs _ project @xcite and the aavso association @xcite .",
    "low resolution ( @xmath0 ) and a objective prism spectroscopy ( @xmath1 near h@xmath2 ) were taken with the canadian copernicus spectrograph ( ccs ) and the flint prism attached to the 60/90 cm schmidt - cassegrain telescope .",
    "medium resolution ( @xmath3 ) echelle spectra were carried out with 28 cm telescope in castanet tolosan observatory in france .",
    "we also used high resolution echelle spectra ( @xmath4 ) obtained with a 40 cm newton telescope in poznan .",
    "nova v2362 cyg was discovered by h. nishimura on apr . 2 , 2006 at @xmath5 @xcite and classified by @xcite as a , , fe  ii  type .",
    "the light curve shows unusual brightening between 130 and 250 day after the maximum ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "@xcite shown that this event contained about @xmath6 of the total energy radiated during the whole outburst .",
    "they also found main properties : the maximum time apr .",
    "6 , 2006 , the brightness @xmath7 , the decline times @xmath8 , @xmath9 and the distance @xmath10 kpc .",
    "the spectra obtained near to both maxima show double p  cyg absorptions in the emission line h@xmath11 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "at the first maximum the expansion velocities were @xmath12 and @xmath13  km  s@xmath14 , between maxima the p  cyg absorption disappeared and emerged in the second maximum with highest velocities @xmath15 and @xmath16  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "simultaneously the h@xmath11 emission has been significantly broader at the second maximum .",
    "an additional red - shifted emission appeared , however the total flux in h@xmath11 , did not increase more than twice .",
    "nova v2467  cyg was discovered by tago @xcite on mar . 15.8 , 2007 at @xmath17 .",
    "the early spectrum obtained on mar .",
    "16.8 , 2007 showed the expansion velocity of about @xmath18 in the p  cyg absorption in h@xmath11 emission line @xcite .",
    "this object was classified by @xcite as `` feii '' type .",
    "@xcite estimated the distance between 1.54 kpc and the outburst amplitude @xmath19 .",
    "our light curve of v2467  cyg is shown in fig .  2 . the spectra of v2467  cyg between apr .",
    "13 , 2007 and may 16 , 2007 were dominated by the balmer emission lines and the extremely strong oi 8446  emission line , which flux was grater than the flux observed in h@xmath11 line .",
    "the photon emitted by oi 8446  can be strengthened as a result of pumping of the ly@xmath2 photons @xcite , and the observed fluxes suggest an overabundance of oxygen in this object @xcite .",
    "nova vulpeculae 2007 was discovered by h. abe @xcite on 2007 aug 8.54 ut . at @xmath20 . in the beginning",
    "the object was classified as a `` fe  ii '' type nova and later as a hybrid nova @xcite .",
    "the nova presented an unusual light curve ( fig .",
    "3 ) with fast fading and three short maxima separated by 35 days . at each of the maximum we measured velocities of p  cyg absorption observed in h@xmath11 emission line which were slightly increasing in following maxima . in fig .",
    "3 we show the evolution of hei 6678 .",
    "most characteristic in this line seems to be the , , saddle shape ",
    "profiles visible after each of the maxima .",
    "the full width at zero intesity ( fwzi ) of this line measured one day after the first , second and the third maximum , was @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 km  s@xmath14 respectively .",
    "the most probably , we can see the three independent ejections with the increasing velocities .",
    "nova v2491 cyg was detected by f. kabashima and k. nishiyama on apr .",
    "10.7 , 2008 at @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the very broad h@xmath11 emissions with fwhm of @xmath25 km  s@xmath14 were visible on our first spectra on apr . 11.99 , 2008 and apr . 13.95 @xcite .",
    "we classified this nova as a , , he / n  type with a post - maximum spectrum of subclass @xmath26 ( see * ? ? ? * ) , and also suggested its similarity to spectra of the recurrent nova u sco and v394 cra .",
    "moreover , v2491 cyg is the second nova which has been observed in x - rays before the outburst @xcite , the previous was v2487 oph . on our early spectra , except balmer emission lines , there were strong lines in the near infrared region : hei 10083 , ni 8692 , 8212 , mgii 9226 .",
    "spectra obtained between apr .",
    "15 and 25 , 2008 showed the double p  cyg absorptions in balmer emission lines with the velocities from @xmath27 to @xmath28 km  s@xmath14 for the slower , and from @xmath29 to 6400 km  s@xmath14 for the faster component .",
    "the light curve , the color variations and the evolution of h@xmath11 and oi 8446  profiles are shown in fig .  4 .",
