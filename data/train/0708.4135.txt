    "in recent years , the role of the strangeness content of the nucleon has been the subject of numerous experimental and theoretical studies .",

    "the happex collaboration measured the strange electric form factor @xmath3 .",
    "the data produce @xmath3 and @xmath4 values consistent with zero at low @xmath1 , hence a hadron model with no strangeness contributions is compatible with the data .",
    "the pva4 experiment @xcite measured the parity violating asymmetry in polarized electron elastic scattering at @xmath1=0.1 and 0.230 ( gev / c)@xmath2 and forward electron scattering angles , and found a negative asymmetry that is smaller than the one expected in the absence of strangeness contributions .",
    "they extracted a combination @xmath5 that is positive , indicating small values for the strangeness form factors , but consistent with zero @xcite . a combination of these results with those of the sample experiment at mit - bates @xcite , that isolated the magnetic contribution @xmath4 in a low - energy measurement at backward scattering angles for @xmath1 values of 0.1 and 0.04 ( gev / c)@xmath2 , hints at small and positive values for @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite .",

    "the @xmath1 dependence of the extracted @xmath5 is quite remarkable .",
    "it might indicate negative values for @xmath7 for @xmath1 values up to 0.3 ( gev / c)@xmath2 , and shows a clear tendency towards positive values of @xmath5 at larger @xmath1 .",
    "these results are consistent with the happex , sample and pva4 ones .",
    "although the value of the strangeness contribution to the axial current and its @xmath1 dependence is not precisely known yet , it is clear that strangeness has a considerable impact on the axial form factor .",
    "polarized lepton deep inelastic scattering experiments carried out by the smc @xcite and hermes @xcite collaborations pointed to negative values for @xmath8 of the order @xmath9 - 0.1 .",
    "unfortunately , quite some uncertainty stems from the fact that the extraction of the first moment of the strange quarks helicity distribution from the polarized structure function is subject to assumptions concerning the validity of @xmath10 flavor symmetry in hyperon @xmath11-decays and extrapolation of the spin structure function to vanishing bjorken @xmath12 . in pves the heavily suppressed axial strangeness contribution is veiled by radiative corrections .",

    "an important effort in this direction was the brookhaven e734 experiment @xcite that measured neutrino and antineutrino scattering off protons in the range 0.4 ( gev / c)@xmath13 ( gev / c)@xmath2 , and used the ratio of neutral - to - charged current cross sections to extract information on the strange spin of the proton .",

    "hadron models have made widely different predictions for the vector strangeness quantities @xcite .",
    "several recent theoretical studies of neutrino - nucleus scattering at intermediate energies @xcite highlighted particular aspects of the strangeness glimpses that can be caught in quasielastic neutrino - scattering experiments . in this paper , we aim at providing a more systematic overview of the sensitivity of various neutrino cross - section ratios to the nucleon s strange quark content .",
    "next to the well - studied ratios of proton - over - neutron knockout and neutral - over - charged current cross sections , we look into the influence of strangeness on the paschos - wolfenstein relation and the longitudinal helicity asymmetry .",

    "<S> we present a systematic study of the sensitivity of quasielastic neutrino - nucleus cross sections at intermediate energies to the strange quark sea of the nucleon . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the impact of the weak strangeness form factors on the ratio of proton - to - neutron knockout , the ratio of neutral - to - charged current cross sections , on the paschos - wolfenstein relation , and on the longitudinal helicity asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of axial as well as vector strangeness effects is discussed . for the latter , we introduce strangeness parameters from various hadron models and from a recent fit to data from parity violating electron scattering .    in our model , the nuclear target </S>",
    "<S> is described in terms of a relativistic mean - field approach . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of final - state interactions on the outgoing nucleon are quantified within a relativistic multiple - scattering glauber approach . </S>",
    "<S> our results are illustrated with cross sections for the scattering of 1 gev neutrinos and antineutrinos off a @xmath0c target .    </S>",
    "<S> folding with a proposed finesse ( anti)neutrino energy - distribution has no qualitative influence on the overall sensitivity of the cross - section ratios to strangeness mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> we show that vector strangeness effects are large and strongly @xmath1 dependent . </S>"
