    "chaotic quantum systems have been found to obey remarkable universal laws related to , e.g.  , energy levels , eigenfunctions , transition amplitudes or transport properties .",
    "these laws are independent of the details of individual systems and depend only on spin and time - reversal symmetries .",
    "the universality manifests itself in various statistical distribution , such as the famous wigner - dyson distribution for the energy levels in closed systems , the thomas - porter distribution for wave function intensities , wave function form , conductance fluctuations , etc.(for overviews , see e.g.  [ ] ) .",
    "two - dimensional ballistic systems like chaotic quantum billiards ( quantum dots ) have played an important role in the development of quantum chaos .",
    "these systems are ideal because they have clear classical counterparts .",

    "may proceed continuously from completely closed systems to open ones . here",
    "we will focus on open chaotic systems in which a current flow is induced by external means .",
    "simulations for open chaotic 2d systems have shown , for example , that there is an abundance of chaotic states that obey generalized wave function distributions that depend on the degree of openness [ ] .",
    "there are universal distributions and correlation functions for nodal points and vortices [ ] and the closely related universal distributions [ ] and correlation functions for the probability current density [ ] .    in this article",
    "we will focus on the pauli quantum stress tensor ( qst ) for open planar chaotic billiards and its statistical properties . as we will see qst supplements previous studies of wave function statistics and flow patterns in an important way as it probes higher order derivatives ( irrespective of the chosen gauge ) and thereby fine details of a wave function .",
    "qst was introduced by pauli [ ] already in 1933 but in contrast to the corresponding classical entities for electromagnetic fields and fluids [ ] , for example , it has remained somewhat esoteric since then . on the other hand ,",
    "studies of stress are in general an important part of material science research and , on a more fundamental atomistic level , stress originates from quantum mechanics .",
    "efficient computational methods based on electronic structure calculations of solids have therefore been developed to analyze both kinetic and configurational contributions to stress [ ] .",
    "the recent advances in nanomechanics also puts more emphasis on the quantum - mechanical nature of stress [ ] .",
    "furthermore it features in quantum hydrodynamic simulations of transport properties of different quantum - sized semiconductor devices like resonant tunneling devices ( rtd ) and high electron mobility transistors ( hemt ) [ ] and in atomic physics and chemistry [ ] . all in all , qst is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics that ties up with local forces and the flow of probability density .",
    "hence it is natural to extend the previous studies of generic statistical distributions for open chaotic quantum billiards to also include the case of stress .",
    "our choice of planar ballistic quantum billiards is favorable in this respect as stress is then only of kinetic origin .",
    "moreover , the motion in an open high - mobility billiard may ideally be viewed as interaction - free because the nominal two - dimensional mean free path may exceed the dimensions of the billiard itself . in this sense",
    "we are dealing to a good approximation with single - particle behavior .",
    "there is an ambiguity in the expression for the stress tensor because any divergence - free tensor may be added without affecting the forces [ ] . for clarifying our definitions and particular choice , we repeat the basic steps , albeit elementary , in pauli s original derivation of his qst [ ] .",

    "the kinetic pauli qst is sometimes referred to as the quantum - mechanical momentum flux density , see e.g. ref .",

    "there are obvious measurement problems associated with qst for a quantum billiard , among them the limited spatial resolution presently available ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "[ ] ) . in the case of 2d quantum billiards there is , however , a beautiful way out of this dilemma , a way that we will follow here .",
    "it turns out that single - particle states @xmath14 in a hard - wall quantum billiard with constant inner potential obey the same stationary helmholtz equation and same boundary condition as states in a flat microwave resonator do [ ] .",
    "this means that our quantum billiard can be emulated from microwave analogues in which the perpendicular electric field @xmath15 takes the role of the wave function @xmath14 . since the electric field",
    "may be measured this kind of emulation gives us a unique opportunity to inspect the interior of a quantum billiard experimentally @xcite . using the",
    "one - to - one correspondence between the poynting vector and the probability current density , probability densities and currents have been studied in a microwave billiard with a ferrite insert as well as in open billiards .",
    "distribution functions based on measurements were obtained for probability densities , currents , and vorticities .",
    "in addition , vortex pair correlation functions have be extracted .",
    "for all quantities studied [ ] complete agreement was obtained with predictions based on the assumption that wave functions in an chaotic billiard may be represented by a random superposition of monochromatic plane waves [ ] .",
    "the layout of the article is the following . in section  [ sectionii ]",
    "we outline the meaning of qst by referring to madelung s hydrodynamic formulation of quantum mechanics from 1927 [ ] .",
    "section  [ sectioniii ] presents the derivation of the distribution functions for the components of the qst in 2d assuming that the wave function may be described in terms of a random gaussian field and that the net current is zero .",
    "although our focus is on 2d the results are extended to 3d as well . section  [ sectioniv ] deals with the distribution of the quantum potential that appears naturally in the hydrodynamic formulation of quantum mechanics . in section  [ sectionv ]",
    "we present numerical simulations of transport through an open sinai billiard with two opposite leads and a comparison with the analytical gaussian random field model is made .",
    "microwave measurements are reported in section  [ exp ] and analyzed in terms of the quantum stress tensor . a berry - type wave function with directional properties",
    "is introduced in the same section to analyze the influence of net currents on the statistical distributions for @xmath0 .",
    "one of the earliest physical interpretations of the schrdinger equation is due to madelung who introduced the hydrodynamic formulation of quantum mechanics already in 1927 [ ] . this is a helpful step to get a more intuitive understanding in classical terms of , for example , quantum - mechanical probability densities and the meaning of quantum stress ( see e.g.  refs .

    "in particular the deviations from the theory in section  [ sectioniii ] increase monotonously with the net current , just as in the experiment .",
    "an obvious question is why these net current effects are unimportant in the simulations for the sinai billiard presented in section  [ sectionv ] .",
    "one may argue that the number of independent plane waves entering at a given frequency is given by the circumference of the billiard divided by @xmath175 , where @xmath143 is the wavelength .",
    "also the width of each wave guide is of the order of @xmath175 , i.e. the relative net current is approximately given by the total widths of all openings divided by the circumference of the billiard .",
    "following this argumentation the net current in the experiments amounted to about 10  percent of the total current , whereas in the simulations for the sinai billiard it was smaller by a factor of 10 ; i.e. too small to be of any importance in the simulations .",
    "we have shown that in the limit of small net currents , the distributions of qst components obtained from the experiment are well described by means of the random plane wave model and the analytic distributions in section  [ sectioniii ] .",
    "on the other hand net currents are unavoidable in open systems .",
    "as indicated by the simulations for a sinai billiard in section  [ sectionv ] , the magnitudes and effect on the different stress tensor distributions may be sensitive to geometry and energy .",
    "hence it remains an open task for theory to incorporate net currents in order to allow a more realistic comparison with present experimental results .",
