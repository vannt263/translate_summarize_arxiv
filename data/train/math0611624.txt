    "one of the ideas in these works is to identify the cases where @xmath10 is exact and proceed to the computation of the mahler measure by means of stokes s theorem , obtaining special values of the bloch - wigner dilogarithm .",
    "later maillot suggested a way to continue these ideas for more variables keeping in mind the cohomological interpretation .",
    "in @xcite we developed these ideas for some three - variable cases involving evaluations of trilogarithms and shed some light on how these computations could be carried on for more variables .",
