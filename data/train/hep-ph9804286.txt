    "the pseudoscalar octet @xmath12 forms the set of lowest mass hadronic states and are thus particles that play a central role in heavy ion collisions , since they occur copiously . in particular",
    "the pion , with lowest mass and being an isospin triplet has a central role , while the kaonic sector , occurring as isospin doublets , gives us information on strangeness production .",
    "since this octet consists of the goldstone bosons associated with spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , their role in nature is determined almost exclusively by this feature .",
    "conversely , our understanding of chiral symmetry breaking is augmented by studying the properties of such mesons , and this can be extended to finite temperatures and baryon density .    the purpose of this paper is to examine elastic @xmath13 scattering in particular at @xmath7 and at finite temperatures .",
    "expressions for the transition amplitudes and hence the scattering lengths at @xmath7 are derived and then the temperature dependence of the scattering lengths is investigated .",
    "this is of interest ( a ) in its own right , although at present it is unclear how one would access finite temperature scattering lengths experimentally , and ( b ) as it provides a first step in the calculation of the elastic @xmath13 cross - sections as a function of the temperature that are required as input for the collision dynamics for a simulation of heavy - ion collisions using a chiral lagrangian .    at @xmath7",
    ", @xmath0 scattering has been studied within the framework of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite .",
    "it is not _ a priori _ clear to what extent a chiral expansion is appropriate for properties involving the strange quark , in view of its mass . yet",
    "the results of even the early calculations of the scattering lengths @xcite fall within the expected measured range @xcite , although one should note that actual experimental values are rather poorly known .",
    "an elaboration of this approach that includes intermediate resonances @xcite , in particular the exchange of the vector @xmath14 in the @xmath4-channel as well as of a @xmath15-meson in the @xmath2-channel , alters the actual numerical values by 2% at most .    in this paper",
    ", we wish to examine the @xmath0 scattering lengths at finite temperature .",
    "the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite gives a good description of these deeply bound mesons at @xmath7 . in obtaining such a description , the mean field or hartree approximation to the self - energy , together with the random phase approximation for the mesonic fields has been used .",
    "it has been recognized that these approximations taken together constitute an expansion in the inverse number of colors @xmath1 , within the model @xcite and are essential in order to preserve the chiral symmetry of the underlying lagrangian . for @xmath16 , the dependence of some of the pseudoscalar and scalar mesons as a function of temperature",
    "has qualitatively been validated by lattice gauge calculations @xcite .",
    "the results of ref.@xcite display a remarkable qualitative agreement with the finite temperature behavior of the njl model ( pole ) masses .",
    "this gives one some confidence in the application of this model in this form to finite temperature , although it is speculative .",
    "in addition , it can be shown that the current algebra results or alternatively the results of chiral perturbation theory to lowest order can be obtained from this model on making a suitable chiral expansion @xcite .",
    "it is then a simple issue to extend calculations to finite temperature , and examine the consequences thereof .",
    "there is no necessity to enforce the chiral limit , since this is a model study .",
    "we thus examine the three flavor njl model .",
    "contributions to the scattering amplitude are organized according to the expansion in @xmath1 .",
    "to lowest order within this scheme , there are several sorts of graphs that occur : a box graph is present , analogous to the four - point tree - like structure of mesonic theories . in addition , in the @xmath2 channel , exchange of neutral scalars , in this case the @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 states occur .",
    "this has no counterpart in the chpt version .- meson can be exchanged in this minimal version of the njl model , but would also be of the same order as the @xmath21 exchanges in the @xmath1 expansion within an extended njl model @xcite . for this reason , we do not calculate the @xmath22 scattering lengths @xmath23 , @xmath24 . ]",
    "finally , the @xmath4 channel contains the exchange of a @xmath5 , corresponding to the @xmath25 meson  note that this also differs from the chpt calculations that explicitly include vector resonance exchange of the @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "note that in our case , no six point tadpole - like diagrams @xcite are present .",
    "in addition , unitarising graphs that include @xmath0 scattering in the intermediate state are not included to this lowest order in @xmath1 calculation of the scattering lengths in the njl model , but which would be essential for a complete description of the scattering amplitude of cross section calculated as a function of center of mass energy .    before discussing our results ,",
    "we comment on the procedure that is to be taken , in particular with regard to the application of the mean field plus random phase approximation at @xmath7 and at @xmath16 . as discussed earlier , this coupled symmetry preserving approximation works excellently at @xmath7 .",
    "this is true for calculating static mesonic properties , such as masses , mean charge radii and scattering lengths , particularly in the su(2 ) sector , where these have been studied in detail and are well - known .",
    "corrections to the mean field values introduce chiral logarithms , see for example @xcite and further powers in the pion mass .",
    "calculations of the full scattering cross - sections , however , do require these corrections , even at @xmath7 , in order to preserve unitarity .",
    "thus only scattering lengths can be reliably calculated .",
    "this is well - established for the two flavor case @xcite and is the reason for our restriction to investigating this quantity only .    in extending our calculation to finite temperature , we are being speculative , encouraged however , by the success of the qualitative agreement of the lattice predictions of the temperature variation of particle masses with those predicted by the model .",
    "furthermore , it is not expected that terms beyond this leading @xmath1 calculation play a dominant role , since the chiral logarithms and powerlike mass terms that might then occur depend then on the temperature dependent pion mass , which in turn stays constant within the model for a wide range of temperatures , even up to 200 mev .",
    "the divergences that have been found in this work in the scattering lengths are induced by the presence of the inverse of the decay constants which themselves become small at high temperatures .",
    "this feature should remain unchanged by higher order corrections .",
    "our model results depend on the regularization procedure used , and can therefore at most be qualitative . while the pauli - villars method is generally preferred at @xmath7 since it preserves all symmetries , and enables one to check that the crossing symmetries are correctly implemented , at @xmath26 , lorentz invariance is broken by the heat bath so that a three dimensional cutoff can be used .",
    "we thus only expect to obtain a qualitative description .",
    "we evaluate the scattering lengths at @xmath7 using both prescriptions , and considering parameters sets of other authors @xcite that were used for different purposes to fix other variables . in this sense",
    ", we do not fit model parameters so as to explicitly give us good values of the scattering lengths .",
    "our results at @xmath7 are obtained using both regularization schemes . at finite temperatures",
    ", we find that the @xmath2 channel varies somewhat with temperature due to the exchange of the scalar mesons , which themselves have a strong temperature dependence , and we find that the variation of @xmath9 in particular , is visible . at @xmath11  mev , the @xmath7 value is increased by a factor of 2.36 .",
    "this is in contrast to the temperature dependence found for the @xmath27 scattering lengths @xcite which show almost no change over @xmath7 to 150 mev .",
    "the value of @xmath10 changes only slightly , increasing in this case only by a factor of 1.18 .",
