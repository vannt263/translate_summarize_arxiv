    "<S> the ratio of the two fragmentation probabilities for the @xmath54 case also differs significantly more from the heavy quark spin symmetry prediction of 3 , being about 1.6 , than in the @xmath0 case , as one expects . also , the ratio @xmath66 is 0.62 , rather than 0.75 .    to further test the sensitivity of our results to the input parameters assumed we have repeated the calculation of the @xmath54 and @xmath55 spectra using the measurement of the decay constant </S>",
    "<S> @xmath67 recently reported by the cleo collaboration @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the measured total production probability was used to determine the strange quark mass parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the result for @xmath6 was quite reasonable , being well above the current quark mass value , but lower than values often used for the constituent quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> we note that at the scale @xmath27 that @xmath71 is uncomfortably large , which could mean there are significant corrections , which have not been calculated , to the fragmentation function at the heavy quark scale , which was calculated using perturbative qcd . but </S>",
    "<S> this only affects the normalization and we determined the parameter @xmath6 from the experimental value of the total production probability . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we repeated the calculation for @xmath54 and @xmath55 meson production by fragmentation and found substantially the same value for @xmath6 and verified that the momentum distributions were only moderately sensitive to the value of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the results were also not sensitive to the values assumed for the heavy quark masses or the meson decay constants . </S>",
    "<S> essentially , the experimental production probability fixes the normalization , the perturbative qcd result determines the shape of the momentum spectrum at the heavy quark mass scale , and the altarelli - parisi equation governs the evolution up to the scale @xmath72 ; so perhaps it is not so surprising that the results are not too sensitive to the particular values of the parameters .    </S>",
