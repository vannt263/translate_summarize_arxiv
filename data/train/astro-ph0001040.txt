    "the study of individual nearby galaxies that belong to the local group is presently one of the most active areas of extragalactic research . as a result",
    "the recent reviews by van den bergh ( 1999a , 2000 ) are already slightly out of date .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to provide an updated report on the status of the most recent research on individual local group members , and on the structure of the local group itself .",
    "the individual galaxies for which new information has become available are listed below in approximate order of decreasing luminosity .      kormendy & bender ( 1999 ) have used spectroscopy with high angular resolution to study the binary nucleus of m31 .",
    "their observations support tremaine s model in which p@xmath1 is the brightest part of a single eccentric disk , where stars linger while at the apocenters of their orbits around p@xmath2 .",
    "the latter object is found to contain a @xmath3 black hole .",
    "barmby et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have published a catalog of 435 probable globular clusters in m31 , of which 330 have ubv photometry , and 158 have been observed spectroscopically .",
    "these authors find that the metal - poor clusters have larger projected distances from the galaxy center , and show lower rotation , than do the metal - rich clusters .",
    "they estimate that m31 contains @xmath4 globulars , from which the specific globular cluster frequency @xmath5 .",
    "hamilton & fesen ( 1999 ) have used the hubble space telescope to image absorption by the remnant of the supernova s andromedae ( sn 1885a ) , which is observed to have a diameter of @xmath6 , in the light of fe ii . from their observations",
    "these authors conclude that this remnant contains between 0.1 and 1.0 @xmath7 of iron .",
    "many years ago eggen & sandage ( 1959 ) suggested that rr lyrae and groombridge 1830 ( hr 4550 ) belong to a small physical group of five stars that are traversing the solar neighborhood at high velocity . the view that such clumps of high - velocity stars are real is supported by observations with the hipparcos satellite ( helmi et al .",
    "1999 ) . from space motions of a nearly complete sample of nearby high - velocity halo stars",
    "these authors conclude that seven objects are members of a single debris stream . from their data helmi et al .",
    "conclude that @xmath88% of all metal - poor stars outside the solar radius represent the remnants of a single disintegrated dwarf galaxy .",
    "however , this estimate may turn out to be too high if a single narrow debris stream presently happens to be passing through the solar neighborhood .",
    "figer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have determined the slope of the mass spectrum of in the arches and quintuplet clusters , which are located near the galactic center .",
    "they find that the mass spectra of these very young clusters have a slope @xmath9 , which is less steep than that for young clusters elsewhere in the galaxy which typically have @xmath10 .",
    "each cluster has a mass of @xmath11 , which are among the highest known in the galaxy .",
    "taken at face value these results suggest that the region near the galactic center is particularly prone to forming very massive open clusters . from near - infrared echelle spectra carr , sellgren & balachandran ( 1999 ) find that [ fe / h ] = -0.02 @xmath12 0.13 , i.e. nearly solar , for the galactic center supergiant irs 7 .      corbelli & salucci ( 1999 ) have measured the rotation curve of m33 out to a distance of 16 kpc ( 13 disk scale - lengths ) and find that the rotation curve rises out to the last measured point .",

    "gibson ( 1999 ) has reviewed recent distance determinations for the lmc , which range from ( m - m)@xmath20 to 18.75 .",

    "sakai , zaritsky & kennicutt ( 1999 ) have recently used the magnitude level of the tip of the lmc red giant branch to derive a distance modulus ( m - m)@xmath21 ( random ) @xmath22 ( systematic ) , which agrees well with previous determinations via cepheid variables .",
    "dolphin ( 1999b ) has studied the star formation history in two fields in the lmc .",
    "his results , which are summarized in table 1 , appear to show ( 1 ) a steady rise of the metallicity index [ fe / h ] with time , and ( 2 ) that the rate of star formation between 2.5 and 7 gyr ago was an order of magnitude lower than it has been during the most recent 23 gyr period .",
    "since the two fields studied by dolphin are separated by @xmath23 ( 2.6  kpc ) his data refer to global star formation rates .",
    "taken at face value dolphin s results appear to weaken the previous conclusion that the rate of cluster formation in the large cloud increased more rapidly @xmath83 gyr ago than did the rate of star formation .",
    "however , holtzman et al . ( 1999 ) reach a very different conclusion from observations of two fields in the outer disk of the lmc .",

    "it is presently not understood why globular cluster formation occurred simultaneously in the lmc , the main body of the galactic halo , and in the outer galactic halo ( ngc 2419 ) .    from the relatively large number of red clump stars in the lmc bar holtzman",
    "conclude that the stellar population in the bar is older than that in the outer fields of the large cloud .",
    "this conflicts with some previous work that had suggested that the lmc bar might be a relatively recent feature . from their integrated spectra dutra et al .",

    "these authors give likely identifications for 144 sources . of these objects 46 ( 32% )",
    "appear to be associated with supernova remnants , 17 ( 12% ) are x - ray binaries , and nine ( 6% ) are `` supersoft '' sources .",
    "the majority of unidentified sources are probably associated with background galaxies or foreground stars .",
    "demers & battinelli ( 1999 ) have surveyed the periphery of the lmc for young blue stars that might be associated with the bridge linking the large and the small clouds .",
    "few such stars are found suggesting that the bridge does not extend deep into the lmc .",
    "liebert ( 1999 ) has pointed out that the hot blue star found in the lmc cluster ngc 1818 has the wrong luminosity and radius to be a luminous white dwarf .",
    "murali ( 1999 ) finds that the motion of the magellanic stream through ambient gas can strongly heat the stream clouds , driving mass loss and causing evaporation .",
    "survival of the stream for 500 myr sets an upper limit @xmath26 for the galactic halo gas through which the stream in orbiting .",
    "most previous investigators have concluded that cluster formation in the small cloud has proceeded at a more - or - less uniform rate .",
    "however new cluster age determinations by rich et al .",
    "( 1999 ) now suggest that cluster formation in the smc may have been enhanced during bursts that occurred 2 gyr and 8 gyr ago .",
    "more , and more accurate , age determinations for small cloud clusters will be required to strengthen this conclusion .",
    "an unbiased survey of 93 star clusters in a 2.4 square degree area of the smc ( pieterzyski & udalski 1999 ) shows an age distribution that is very strongly biased towards young clusters , with only 3% of the clusters having ages @xmath27  gyr .",
    "the fact that 60% of all smc clusters are younger than 100 myr should probably be interpreted as evidence for short cluster life - times , rather than as evidence for a recent burst of cluster formation .",
    "bica & dutra ( 1999 ) have published an updated census of smc clusters , and of clusters in the bridge between the lmc and smc , that is based on the ogle survey .",
    "their paper contains a map of the distribution of smc clusters , which shows a strong concentration in the small cloud `` bar '' and a lesser concentration of clusters in the wing of the smc .",
    "cold atomic hydrogen has been detected in the bridge between the magellanic clouds by kobulnicky & dickey ( 1999 ) .",
    "the early - type stars observed in the bridge could have formed in these cold clouds .",
    "these objects therefore need not have migrated from the main body of the smc .",
    "rolleston et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have compared the abundances of three early - type stars in the bridge between the lmc and the smc with those observed in `` normal '' b - type stars near the sun .",
    "they found an average metal deficiency [ m / h ]  @xmath28 for these objects .",
    "surprisingly this value falls well below the present ( luck et al .",
    "1998 ) smc metallicity [ fe / h ]  @xmath29 .",
    "in fact it lies between that of the globular cluster ngc 121 ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath30 ) , which has an age of @xmath812 gyr , and that of the old open cluster l  1 ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath31 ) that has an age of @xmath810 gyr . taken at face value",
    "this result suggests that the material in the bridge was tidally detached from the small cloud @xmath810 gyr ago .",
    "however , putman ( 1999 ) has argued that the bridge was formed only 0.2 gyr ago , when the lmc and smc had a very close encounter with a minimum separation of only @xmath87 kpc .",
    "alternatively it might be hypothesized that the metallicity of gas in the bridge was lowered by swept - up pristine inter - galactic gas .",

    "<S> the present note updates the information published in my recent monograph on . </S>",
    "<S> highlights include ( 1 ) the addition of the newly discovered cetus dwarf spheroidal as a certain member of the local group , ( 2 ) an improved distance for sagdig , which now places this object very close to the edge of the local group zero - velocity surface , ( 3 ) more information on the evolutionary histories of some individual local group members , and ( 4 ) improved distance determinations to , and luminosities for , a number of local group members . </S>",
    "<S> these data increase the number of certain ( or probable ) local group members to 36 . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial distribution of these galaxies supports hubble s claim that the local group `` is isolated in the general field . '' presently available </S>",
    "<S> evidence suggests that star formation continued much longer in many dwarf spheroidals than it did in the main body of the galactic halo . </S>",
    "<S> it is suggested that `` young '' globular clusters , such as ruprecht 106 , might have formed in now defunct dwarf spheroidals . </S>",
    "<S> assuming sagdig , which is the most remote local group galaxy , to lie on , or just inside , the zero - velocity surface of the local group yields a dynamical age @xmath0  gyr . </S>"
