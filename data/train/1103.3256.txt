    "let us construct ranked percolation configurations on a random landscape starting with the bond with the largest number ( height ) and then occupying bonds sequentially in order of decreasing number . each time a chosen bond closes a loop , it is not occupied ( loopless ) .",
    "one stops the procedure when , for the first time , a path of connected sites spans from one side to the other ( percolation threshold ) . since all clusters are trees , the backbone and the shortest path are the same and their fractal dimension is identical to the bridge - bond line , as verified in fig .",
    "[ fig::nbbdim ] .",
    "in fact , given the connectivity / disconnection relation discussed in the previous section , this line corresponds to the bridge line when bonds are occupied from the lowest to the largest number in the covering graph .",

    "the sequence of optimal paths between opposite borders is obtained and their highest site removed .",
    "every such path crosses the bridge line .",
    "the highest site on successive paths is either on the bridge line itself or is higher than the lowest bridge - line site .",
    "therefore , as in the loopless percolation described before , the removed sites percolate when all sites on the bridge line are removed , which is the backbone of the crack , giving the same fractal dimension @xmath12 .",
    "this is in fact the case for the crack of any sequence of self - avoiding paths between opposite borders .",
    "since in this case the duality between cutting and bridges is not used ( only valid in 2d ) , the relation between opc and bridge bonds is still true in higher dimensions .",
    "let us now define the optimal minimax path ( omp ) in the following way .",
    "one starts selecting the set of paths on the landscape for which the highest - ranked site is minimum ( minimax paths ) .",
    "such set is then reduced to include only the paths for which the second highest site is also minimum and one proceeds iteratively to the following sites , until a unique path is obtained .",
    "this path is the optimal path in strong disorder @xcite , since under such disorder strength each site is higher than the sum over the height of all sites with lower rank .",
    "this path is also identical to the backbone of the loopless - ranked - percolation cluster when occupied from the lowest to the largest number and , therefore , the cutting line in any dimension .    in summary",

    "<S> discretized landscapes can be mapped onto ranked surfaces , where every element ( site or bond ) has a unique rank associated with its corresponding relative height . </S>",
    "<S> by sequentially allocating these elements according to their ranks and systematically preventing the occupation of bridges , namely elements that , if occupied , would provide global connectivity , we disclose that bridges hide a new tricritical point at an occupation fraction @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the percolation threshold of random percolation . for any value of @xmath2 in the interval @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the set of bridges has a fractal dimension @xmath4 in two dimensions . in the limit @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> , a self - similar fracture is revealed as a singly connected line that divides the system in two domains . </S>",
    "<S> we then unveil how several seemingly unrelated physical models tumble into the same universality class and also present results for higher dimensions .    </S>",
    "<S> any real landscape can be duly coarse - grained and represented as a two - dimensional _ discretized map _ of regular cells ( e.g. , a square lattice of sites or bonds ) to which average heights can be associated . </S>",
    "<S> this process is exemplarily shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig::rank](a)-(c ) . as such </S>",
    "<S> , the concept of discretized maps has been considered as a way to delimit spatial boundaries in a wide range of seemingly unrelated problems , ranging from tracing water basins and river networks in landscapes @xcite to the identification of cancerous cells in human tissues @xcite , and the study of spatial competition in multispecies ecosystems @xcite . moreover , previous studies have shown that cracks or surviving paths through discretized maps possess a universal fractal dimension which can be physically realized in terms of optimal paths under strong disorder @xcite , optimal path cracks @xcite , loopless percolation @xcite , or minimum spanning trees @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that all these problems can be understood in terms of the same universal concept of _ fracturing a ranked surface_.        we start by defining a ranked surface . given a two - dimensional discretized map of size @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> , we generate a list containing the heights of its elements ( sites or bonds ) in crescent order , and then replace the numerical values in the original map by their corresponding ranks . as depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig::rank](d ) , the result is a ranked surface . </S>",
    "<S> the process of fracture generation is rather simple . </S>",
    "<S> once the ranked surface is obtained , we sequentially occupy the elements of an empty lattice with the same size following the crescent rank order of the corresponding elements ( i.e. , in the same position ) on the ranked surface . during each step of the allocation process , only bridges , identified as those lattice elements which , once occupied , would create a spanning cluster ( i.e. , a globally connecting cluster ) @xcite , are never occupied . </S>",
    "<S> these elements will eventually form a macroscopic fracture .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig::snap ] we show the evolution of the fracture line on a large ranked surface with the fraction of occupied bonds @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> as displayed , the lattice is initially seeded by a set of disconnected bridge elements at low values of @xmath2 , while for @xmath5 the fracture finally emerges towards a singly connected line that divides the system in two . as we show later in this article </S>",
    "<S> , our results reveal that this line is fractal with dimension @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , this value is statistically identical to the dimensions of fractures generated from different models previously investigated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , at the percolation threshold value of the classical random percolation model @xcite , @xmath7 , the set of bridge bonds appearing in any configuration of our model should be identical to the set of the so - called _ anti - red bonds _ in random percolation @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . as first proposed by coniglio @xcite and numerically verified by scholder @xcite , at @xmath7 , this set is also fractal , but with dimension @xmath8 ( @xmath9 in 2d ) , where @xmath10 is the correlation length exponent .        </S>",
    "<S> motivated by this substantial change in the fractal behavior at distinct stages of our fracturing process , in what follows we address how the set of bridges scales with the fraction of occupied bonds and the system size at @xmath7 analogously to a theta point @xcite , while for all values of @xmath2 above @xmath11 , it has a fractal dimension @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we introduce a new tricritical crossover exponent , which we study up to dimension six , the upper - critical dimension of percolation . </S>"
