    "we refer to @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a common example is the use of a @xmath6 code to store four bits @xmath7 . by storing the pairs of bits @xmath8 on four different servers ( @xmath9 ) , the four bits @xmath7 can be recovered from the combined information on any two servers ( @xmath10 ) . and",
    "if a server fails it can be rebuilt by retrieving one bit from each of the remaining three servers ( @xmath11 ) . in particular , the first server can be rebuilt from the three bits @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",

    "for the example , @xmath18 .",
    "the gains in a dss are obtained by using a total repair bandwith @xmath19 that is possibly larger than @xmath16 but much smaller than the file size @xmath15 .",

    "the outer bound can be interpreted as an upper bound on the file size @xmath15 , for given @xmath16 and @xmath17 , or as a lower bound for @xmath16 and @xmath17 , for a given file size @xmath15 . in the first case it is standard to scale to variables @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and in the second case to variables @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    in this work ,",

    "is describeded by adding to ( [ b433 ] ) the new inequality @xmath34 to prove that all points in the new region can be achieved it suffices , using a standard time sharing argument , that the vertices with @xmath35 can be achieved .",
