    "the distribution of wealth among individuals in an economy has been an important area of research in economics , for more than a hundred years .",
    "pareto @xcite first quantified the high - end of the income distribution in a society and found it to follow a power - law @xmath3 , where @xmath4 gives the normalized number of people with income @xmath0 , and the exponent @xmath2 , called the pareto index , was found to have a value between 1 and 3 .",
    "considerable investigations with real data during the last ten years revealed that the tail of the income distribution indeed follows the above mentioned behavior and the value of the pareto index @xmath2 is generally seen to vary between 1 and 2.5 @xcite .",
    "it is also known that typically less than @xmath5 of the population in any country possesses about @xmath6 of the total wealth of that country and they follow the above law .",
    "the rest of the low income population , in fact the majority ( @xmath7 or more ) , follow a different distribution which is debated to be either gibbs @xcite or log - normal @xcite .",
    "much work has been done recently on models of markets , where economic ( trading ) activity is analogous to some scattering process @xcite .",
    "we put our attention to models where introducing a saving factor for the agents , a wealth distribution similar to that in the real economy can be obtained @xcite .",
    "savings do play an important role in determining the nature of the wealth distribution in an economy and this has already been observed in some recent investigations @xcite .",
    "two variants of the model have been of recent interest ; namely , where the agents have the same fixed saving factor @xcite , and where the agents have a quenched random distribution of saving factors @xcite . while the former has been understood to a certain extent ( see e.g , @xcite ) , and argued to resemble a gamma distribution @xcite , attempts to analyze the latter model are still incomplete ( see however , @xcite ) .",
    "further numerical studies @xcite of time correlations in the model seem to indicate even more intriguing features of the model . in this paper",
    ", we intend to analyze the second market model with randomly distributed saving factor , using a master equation type approach similar to kinetic models of condensed matter .",
    "the market consists of @xmath8 ( fixed ) agents , each having money @xmath9 at time @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) . the total money @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) in the market is also fixed .",
    "each agent @xmath14 has a saving factor @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) such that in any trading ( considered as a scattering ) the agent saves a fraction @xmath15 of its money @xmath9 at that time and offers the rest @xmath17 for random trading .",
    "we assume each trading to be a two - body ( scattering ) process .",
    "the evolution of money in such a trading can be written as : @xmath18,\\ ] ] @xmath19\\ ] ]    where each @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a random fraction ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "typical numerical results for the steady state money distribution in such a model is shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) for uniform distribution of @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) among the agents .",
    "we will now investigate the steady state distribution of money resulting from the above two equations representing the trading and money dynamics .",
    "we will now solve the dynamics of money distribution in two limits .",
    "in one case , we study the evolution of the mutual money difference among the agents and look for a self - consistent equation for its steady state distribution . in the other case",
    ", we develop a master equation for the money distribution function .      clearly in the process",
    "as considered above , the total money @xmath23 of the pair of agents @xmath14 and @xmath24 remains constant , while the difference @xmath25 evolves as @xmath26.\\ ] ]    numerically , as shown in fig . 1",
    ", we observe that the steady state money distribution in the market becomes a power law , following such tradings when the saving factor @xmath15 of the agents remain constant over time but varies from agent to agent widely . as shown in the numerical simulation results for @xmath1 in fig .",
    "1(b ) , the law , as well as the exponent , remains unchanged even when @xmath27 for every trading .",
    "this can be justified by the earlier numerical observation @xcite for fixed @xmath28 market ( @xmath29 for all @xmath14 ) that in the steady state , criticality occurs as @xmath30 where of course the dynamics becomes extremely slow . in other words , after the steady state is realized , the third term in ( [ ddelmijtt ] ) becomes unimportant for the critical behavior .",
    "we therefore concentrate on this case , where the above evolution equation for @xmath25 can be written in a more simplified form as @xmath31    where @xmath32 and @xmath33 . as such , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the steady state probability distribution @xmath36 for the modulus @xmath37 of the mutual money difference between any two agents in the market can be obtained from ( [ ddelmt ] ) in the following way provided @xmath38 is very much larger than the average money per agent @xmath39 .",
    "this is because , using eqn .",
    "( [ ddelmt ] ) , large @xmath38 can appear at @xmath40 , say , from ` scattering ' from any situation at @xmath10 for which the right hand side of eqn .",
    "( [ ddelmt ] ) is large .",
    "the possibilities are ( at @xmath10 ) @xmath41 large ( rare ) and @xmath42 not large , where the right hand side of eqn .",
    "( [ ddelmt ] ) becomes @xmath43 ; or @xmath42 large ( rare ) and @xmath41 not large ( making the right hand side of eqn .",
    "( [ ddelmt ] ) becomes @xmath44 ) ; or when @xmath41 and @xmath42 are both large , which is a much rarer situation than the first two and hence is negligible .",
    "then if , say , @xmath41 is large and @xmath42 is not , the right hand side of ( [ ddelmt ] ) becomes @xmath45 and so on .",
    "consequently for large @xmath38 the distribution @xmath36 satisfies @xmath46    where we have used the symmetry of the @xmath47 distribution and the relation @xmath48 , and have suppressed labels @xmath14 , @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath49 denote average over @xmath28 distribution in the market .",
    "taking now a uniform random distribution of the saving factor @xmath28 , @xmath50 for @xmath51 , and assuming @xmath52 for large @xmath38 , we get @xmath53    giving @xmath54 .",
    "no other value fits the above equation .",
    "this also indicates that the money distribution @xmath1 in the market also follows a similar power law variation , @xmath3 and @xmath55 .",
    "we will now show in a more rigorous way that indeed the only stable solution corresponds to @xmath56 , as observed numerically @xcite .",
    "we now proceed to develop a boltzmann - like master equation for the time development of @xmath57 , the probability distribution of money in the market .",
    "we again consider the case @xmath58 in ( [ mi ] ) and ( [ mj ] ) and rewrite them as @xmath59    where @xmath60    collecting the contributions from terms scattering in and subtracting those scattering out , we can write the master equation for @xmath57 as ( cf",

    "we can rewrite the equation for @xmath1 above as @xmath70    where the result applies for @xmath71 and @xmath72 sufficiently small .",
    "if we take @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) , then @xmath77    assuming now as before , @xmath78 for @xmath76 , we get @xmath79,\\ ] ]    as the ratio of the third term in ( [ mumu1 ] ) to the other terms vanishes like @xmath80 , @xmath81 in this limit and @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the distributions of the variables @xmath84 and @xmath85 , which vary uniformly in the ranges @xmath86 $ ] and @xmath87 $ ] respectively ( cf . eqn ( [ amu ] ) ) .",
    "the @xmath88 indices , for @xmath84 and @xmath85 are again suppressed here in ( [ mugama ] ) and we utilise the fact that @xmath89 and @xmath90 are independent for @xmath91 . an alternative way of deriving eqn .",
    "( [ mugama ] ) from eqn .",
    "( [ aftrpartial ] ) is to consider the dominant terms ( @xmath92 for @xmath93 , or @xmath94 for @xmath95 ) in the @xmath96 limit of the integral @xmath97 ( see appendix a ) . we therefore get from eqn .",
    "( [ mugama ] ) , after integrations , @xmath98 , giving @xmath56 .",
    "in our models @xcite , we consider the ideal - gas - like trading markets where each agent is identified with a gas molecule and each trading as an elastic or money - conserving ( two - body ) collision . unlike in a gas ,",
    "we introduce a saving factor @xmath28 for each agents . our model , without savings ( @xmath99 ) , obviously yield a gibbs law for the steady - state money distribution .",
    "our numerical results for various widely distributed ( quenched ) saving factor @xmath28 showed @xcite that the steady state income distribution @xmath1 in the market has a power - law tail @xmath3 for large income limit , where @xmath100 . this observation has been confirmed in several later numerical studies as well @xcite .",
    "since @xmath101 can be identified with the inverse rank , our observation in the model with @xmath102 suggests that the rank of any agent goes inversely with his / her income / wealth , fitting very well with the zipf s original observation @xcite .",
    "it has been noted from these numerical simulation studies that the large income group people usually have larger saving factors @xcite .",
    "this , in fact , compares well with observations in real markets @xcite .",
    "the time correlations induced by the random saving factor also has an interesting power - law behavior @xcite . a master equation for @xmath57 , as in ( [ mstr ] ) , for the original case ( eqns . ( [ mi ] ) and ( [ mj ] ) )",
    "was first formulated for fixed @xmath28 ( @xmath15 same for all @xmath14 ) , in @xcite and solved numerically . later",
    ", a generalized master equation for the same , where @xmath28 is distributed , was formulated and solved in @xcite .",
    "we have formulated here a boltzmann - type master equation for the distributed saving factor case in ( [ mi ] ) and ( [ mj ] ) . based on the observation that even in the case with @xmath103 ( with @xmath28 distributed in the range @xmath16 , @xmath104 ) , in ( [ mi ] ) and ( [ mj ] ) , the steady state money distribution has the same power - law behavior as in the general case and shows the same pareto index , we solve the master equation for this special case .",
    "we show that the analytic results clearly support the power - law for @xmath1 with the exponent value @xmath56 .",
    "although our analysis of the solution of the master equation is for a special case and it can not be readily extended to explore the wide universality of the pareto exponent as observed in the numerical simulations of the various versions of our model @xcite , let alone the quasi - universality for other @xmath2 values as observed in the real markets @xcite , the demonstration here that the master equation admits of a pareto - like power law solution ( for large @xmath0 ) with @xmath102 , should be significant .",
    "apart from the intriguing observation that gibbs ( 1901 ) and pareto ( 1897 ) distributions fall in the same category of models and can appear naturally in the century - old and well - established kinetic theory of gas , our study indicates the appearance of self - organized criticality in the simplest ( gas - like ) models so far , when the stability effect of savings is incorporated .",
    "this remarkable effect can be analyzed in terms of master equations developed here and can also be studied analytically in the special limits considered .",
