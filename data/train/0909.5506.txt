    "pseudopotentials are often generated using data from mean - field theories such as density - functional theory and hartree - fock ( hf ) theory , but they are often used in more accurate many - body approaches , such as multi - configuration self - consistent field ( mcscf ) and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations . in this paper",
    "we apply such methods to a simple system , the lih molecule with pseudopotentials representing the li@xmath0 and h@xmath0 ions , for which we can obtain very accurate ground state energies .",
    "our main aim is to investigate the accuracy of pseudopotentials for this system , including the performance of a li core - polarization potential ( cpp ) which introduces some of the effects of core - valence correlation and core relaxation .",
    "the accuracy of the lih interatomic potentials is measured by calculating the spectroscopic constants of the diatomic molecule and the well - depth , which can readily be compared with experiment .",
    "note that our goal is not to achieve the most accurate _ ab initio _",
    "spectroscopic constants - if it were we would solve the all - electron system directly using qmc , or one of the range of accurate methods tractable for a four electron system - but to separate the deficiencies of a model valence hamiltonian from those of the methods available for its solution .",
    "our most accurate results are obtained with the variational quantum monte carlo ( vmc ) method and the more sophisticated diffusion quantum monte carlo ( dmc ) method.@xcite although the scaling of the computational cost of these calculations with particle number @xmath1 is reasonable ( @xmath2@xmath3@xcite ) , the cost increases rapidly with @xmath4 ( @xmath2@xmath5@xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore normal to use pseudopotentials for heavier atoms .",
    "it is highly advantageous to use pseudopotentials which are smooth at the origin in vmc and dmc calculations , but most of the pseudopotentials found in the quantum chemistry literature diverge at the origin .",
    "we have tested two sets of recently published pseudopotentials@xcite for the li@xmath0 and h@xmath0 ions , which are smooth at the origin and have been designed for use in qmc calculations .",
    "one of these is a `` shape - consistent '' pseudopotential@xcite generated from the hartree - fock atomic ground state while the other is an `` energy - consistent '' pseudopotential@xcite generated from the ground and excited state energies of the hartree - fock atom .",
    "the pseudopotential model of the lih diatomic molecule contains two valence electrons of opposite spin .",
    "the ground state wave function is therefore nodeless , so that no error arises from the `` fixed - node approximation '' used to enforce the fermion antisymmetry in dmc .",
    "however , the dmc energy is not exact , even in principle , because the non - local pseudopotential is treated approximately , although we demonstrate that the error must be small in this case .",
    "our calculations are therefore exacting tests of the accuracy of the pseudopotentials and cpp .    throughout",
    "we consider the error of the lih diatomic molecule with both li and h described by pseudopotentials .",
    "no attempt is made to separate the performance of each pseudopotential , but atomic calculations suggest that errors arising from deficiencies of the h pseudopotential will be an order of magnitude smaller than those from the li pseudopotential .",
    "the quality of a diatomic potential can be characterised by the spectroscopic constants , or dunham coefficients,@xcite which can be determined experimentally from the rotation / vibration spectrum .",
    "calculations which include an accurate description of electron correlation are computationally expensive and so they are normally performed at a small number of geometries and the interatomic potential is obtained by fitting to a suitable functional form . fitting to a small number of energies introduces an error which is further exacerbated if the energies have a statistical uncertainty , as in qmc estimates .",
    "we explore this problem carefully and ensure that such errors are small . in what follows only the @xmath6 ( ground ) state of the @xmath7li@xmath8h isotopologue",
    "is considered .",
    "a born - oppenheimer decoupling of the electron / nucleus coordinates of a diatomic molecule leads to the energy levels @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers , and the spectroscopic constants , @xmath12 , depend on the underlying interatomic potential.@xcite not all of these coefficients may be extracted directly from experimental data - @xmath13 can not since it does not influence the spacing of levels , although it is required to define the zero point energy @xmath14 .",
    "we follow dunham and express @xmath13 as @xmath15 for experimental data , while @xmath13 is available directly from _ ab initio _ data .",
    "the zero point energy is given by @xmath16 and the ` harmonic equilibrium separation ' , @xmath17 , is defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the reduced nuclear mass of the system , and all quantities are in atomic units .",
    "finally , we note that the spectroscopic constants are normally defined as @xmath20 although we use the @xmath12 notation throughout .",
    "to obtain estimates of @xmath21 from a set of total energy values requires some further analysis .",
    "we fit a highly flexible form for the interatomic potential to a finite number of total energies evaluated at different geometries .",
    "we use the `` modified lennard - jones oscillator''@xcite potential , @xmath22 , \\label{eq:4}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the total energy for interatomic spacing @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the position of the minimum in the interaction potential , @xmath26 is the well depth , @xmath27 is the large @xmath24 limit of @xmath23 , and @xmath28 is defined by @xmath29 for some choice of @xmath30 , where @xmath31 a non - linear least - squares fit to @xmath23 ( with @xmath27 provided by isolated atom calculations using the same method as the diatomic calculations ) provides the parameters @xmath32 .",
    "note that the bond dissociation energy , @xmath33 , is related to the well depth and the zero point energy by @xmath34 .",
    "the derivatives of @xmath23 at @xmath25 may be evaluated and used together with dunham s formulae@xcite to obtain the spectroscopic constants and the values of @xmath26 and @xmath17 . ) , giving the spectroscopic constants .",
    "although this might be slightly more accurate , tests indicate that it makes no significant difference to the accuracy achieved in lih . ]",
    "the above procedure gives the spectroscopic constants from the total energies at a finite number of geometries .",
    "to apply the procedure we choose a set of sample geometries and the number of free parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) ( @xmath35 ) . for the qmc calculations it is also necessary to choose a target statistical error bar for the qmc energies . generally speaking , for a fixed statistical error in each energy point , using more data points",
    "reduces both the statistical error and systematic bias in the spectroscopic constants , while using data points covering a smaller range of @xmath24 increases the statistical error and reduces the bias . using fewer parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) reduces the statistical error in the estimated spectroscopic constants but increases the bias .",
    "an example of choosing suitable geometries so as to obtain acceptably small statistical errors and biases in a fit to qmc energies is described in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the equation of state of diamond is estimated .    to study these effects",
    "we need a reasonably accurate model of the interatomic potential , for which we use the one constructed recently for lih by coxon and dickinson,@xcite which accurately reproduces a wide range of experimental spectroscopic data",
    ". we will refer to this as the cd potential .",
    "we take energies from the cd potential at a finite number of geometries and determine the resulting errors in the spectroscopic constants using the derivatives of the potential at @xmath25 and dunham s equations .",
    "we then add random noise to the energies and determine a second set of errors in the spectroscopic constants by averaging over the noise .",
    "a set of results from this procedure are given in table  [ tab:1 ] for @xmath36 free parameters and nine geometries characterised by interatomic distances distributed evenly over @xmath37 about @xmath38    ( an estimate of the equilibrium bond length ) , and a statistical error in the energies of @xmath39  a.u . the data in the second row of table  [ tab:1 ] differ from the first row by an amount typical of the variation between experimental estimates , which illustrates the very high accuracy of the spectroscopic constants obtained from the cd potential and dunham s equations . comparing the second and third rows of table  [ tab:1 ]",
    "gives the systematic bias due to using only nine geometries , while the fourth row gives the additional random error due to the noise in the energies .",
    "the net effect on the spectroscopic constants of the bias and random error is small .",
    "for all eight quantities the random error is larger than the bias due to sampling at nine geometries , and the only quantities that differ by more than the statistical error are the values of @xmath26 from experiment and the model potential .",
    "the statistical errors in the total energies calculated in this work are in the range @xmath40  a.u . , and the corresponding errors in the spectroscopic constants are not significantly larger than those reported in table  [ tab:1 ] .",

    "( [ eq:4 ] ) were obtained from either a gaussian basis set and the gamess code , a numerical integration and the atsp2k code,@xcite or the best available values in the literature ( all calculated using the appropriate hamiltonian ) . @xmath41 and",
    "@xmath17 were obtained from the @xmath21 , but @xmath26 was obtained from the fitted potential . both of the pseudo - atoms possess only a single electron , hence only hf calculations were required .",
    "all - electron atomic hf results were calculated numerically or with a gaussian basis , as appropriate , and the post - hf ae atomic energies are from the same papers as the molecular data .",
    "no ae qmc calculations were performed .",
    "the data in table  [ tab:3 ] allows a direct comparison of estimates of the vibrational and rotational properties , the equilibrium geometry , and dissociation energies . in order to be consistent with the experimental results the ` harmonic equilibrium separation ' of eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) is reported rather than interatomic separation with lowest total energy , but the difference between these two quantities is less than @xmath42   .    the experimental results taken as benchmark data are found in the bottom two lines of the table .",
    "the `` cd model '' values are extracted from the cd model potential@xcite using exactly the same procedure as for the _ ab initio _ results .",
    "the `` experimental '' values are those recommended in the literature for low level excitations , which are the most appropriate for our results , i.e. , the results obtained by maki _ et al . _ and reviewed by stwalley@xcite .",
    "hartree - fock results for the tn and bfd pseudopotentials are reported in table  [ tab:3 ] .",
    "also shown are the ae results obtained using the same basis set as for the pseudopotential results ( from gamess ) , using the same gaussian basis and scalar relativistic corrections ( from the douglas , kroll , and hess hamiltonian and gamess ) , and using accurate numerical integration ( from the 2dhf@xcite package ) without relativistic corrections .",
    "this set of results allows a separation of the errors due to the pseudopotentials generally , due to the differences between the tn and bfd pseudopotentials , due to the use of a finite basis set , and due to relativistic effects .",
    "a separation of errors within hf theory is useful since any approximation that fails at this level is unlikely to succeed at a higher level of theory , and because the uncorrelated energies are certainly obtained very accurately .",
    "the hf data gives poor approximations to the experimental results , and the calculations are precise enough to draw some conclusions about the sources of these errors .",
    "the difference between the finite basis set and numerical ae hf results is approximately equal to the target accuracy , and is small compared to the difference between the ae hf and experimental or pseudopotential results . from this",
    "it seems reasonable to conclude that basis set errors are not significant at the available resolution , especially when we bear in mind that the gaussian basis used was constructed and tested for use with pseudopotentials .",
    "similarly , the difference between the relativistic and non - relativistic ae hf results is less than the target precision , and hence we conclude that relativistic effects are not significant at the available resolution .",
    "the hf results for the tn and bfd pseudopotentials are very similar , so it seems reasonable to ascribe most of the consistent difference between the ae hf and pseudopotential hf results to core relaxation .",
    "a similar level of consistency occurs between results for both pseudopotentials when we include correlation at different levels , suggesting that we may ascribe most of the consistent difference between these results and the experimental results to the combination of core relaxation and core - valence correlation , and so distinguish between the two effects .",
    "for example , @xmath43 shows an increase of @xmath44  @xmath45 due to core relaxation , and an increase of @xmath46  @xmath45 due to core - valence correlation , to be compared with a reduction of @xmath47  @xmath45 due to valence correlation .",
    "( where valence correlation is defined via the vmc results , the quoted values are the mean of the values for the two pseudopotentials , and the bracket gives the absolute difference between them . )",
    "table  [ tab:3 ] also contains results obtained from the ae full ci total energies of ref .",
    "these data were used because they provide the most accurate _ ab initio _ estimates of the spectroscopic constants that we are aware of .",
    "these results are in good agreement with experiment , except for @xmath26 which is underestimated .",
    "the mcscf results with the two pseudopotentials agree well with each other , but differ significantly from the ae ci results .    similarly , the vmc results for the tn and bfd pseudopotentials ( without the li cpp ) agree well with one another and are consistent with the analogous mcscf results .",
    "the only clear improvement in the vmc results over the mcscf ones is in the well depth , @xmath26 , which might be expected from the more complete description of correlation effects provided by the vmc calculations .    for each level of correlated calculation ,",
    "the values of @xmath26 and @xmath17 calculated using the tn and bfd pseudopotentials differ by more than the target accuracy , and therefore we can distinguish differences in their performance",
    ". however , the results obtained with the two pseudopotentials are much closer to each other than they are to experiment , so it is clear that neither pseudopotential gives highly accurate results .",
    "we note that the tn pseudopotential consistently gives slightly larger values of @xmath17 than the bfd one , by @xmath48    in hf theory , @xmath49    in mcscf and @xmath50    for vmc ( without the cpp ) .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite studied a number of molecules , including lih , and found the lih bond length with the tn pseudopotentials to be @xmath51    larger than for the bfd ones .",
    "this difference is an order of magnitude larger than we have found , and we believe their bond - length difference must be biased .",
    "similarly , the harmonic vibrational frequencies ( @xmath43 ) and well depth ( @xmath26 ) calculated for tn and bfd by burkatzki _",
    "differ by @xmath52  @xmath45 and @xmath53  @xmath45 , respectively , whereas our vmc results ( without the cpp ) differ by @xmath54  @xmath45 and @xmath55  @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "again we suggest that the harmonic vibrational frequencies and well depths calculated by burkatzki _",
    "are biased in some way .",
    "difference between the vmc total energies , @xmath56 , and those provided by the cd model potential of @xcite .",
    "energy differences are shown for calculations performed with both tn ( solid lines ) and bfd ( dashed lines ) pseudopotentials , and both with ( squares ) and without ( circles ) the li cpp potential .",
    "an offset is added such that @xmath57 as @xmath58 . ]",
    "introducing the li cpp@xcite into the qmc calculations improves @xmath41 and @xmath43 significantly , but makes @xmath26 too large and @xmath17 too small .",
    "these `` biases '' in the calculated values are consistent with those found in previous mcscf calculations@xcite using a different pseudopotential and cpp to those used here .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to attribute these biases in our results to a general deficiency of the pseudopotential+cpp model for the ionic cores .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] shows these biases as the difference between the vmc total energies and the cd model potential@xcite , with an energy offset added such that all curves approach zero for increasing @xmath24 .",
    "all results show an underestimate of the total energy with decreasing @xmath24 of rapidly increasing magnitude , which we ascribe to the overlap of the pseudopotential core regions .",
    "for the calculations without the cpp an overestimate occurs near equilibrium , whereas when the cpp is included this becomes an underestimate of larger magnitude , and for all @xmath24 .",
    "this general trend occurs for both pseudopotentials , such that at the equilibrium separation the bfd result is better than the tn result for no cpp , but the reverse is true when the cpp is introduced .",
    "the same trend also occurs for the equilibrium separation itself .",
    "note that the improved cpp estimates for @xmath43 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath41 correspond to superior 2@xmath61 and higher order derivatives of the potential at @xmath17 , so are more subtle in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .    for all geometries considered , the change in total energy upon introduction of the cpp is very similar for both pseudopotentials .",
    "this is consistent with the suggestion of shirley and martin@xcite that their cpps are valid for use with different types of hf pseudopotential .    for many systems",
    "the computational cost of evaluating the integral required for the pseudopotential energy is very significant , and may even be dominant for dmc calculations in which the number of points in the integration grid , @xmath62 , is large .",
    "the computational cost of the non - local integration depends on the size of the region inside the non - local radius , which is the distance beyond which the angular momentum components of the pseudopotential differ by less than some parameter @xmath63 .",
    "the non - local radii of the _ tabulated _ tn pseudopotentials are consistently smaller than those of the bfd pseudopotentials . for @xmath64  a.u . and",
    "li , the non - local radii are @xmath65    ( tn ) and @xmath66    ( bfd ) . for the dmc calculations considered here this resulted in a @xmath67 smaller computational cost when using the tn pseudopotentials .",
    "the advantage is smaller for vmc calculations .",
    "the cutoff radii of the tn pseudopotentials also depend less sensitively on the value of @xmath63 .",
    "for example , with a tolerance of @xmath68  a.u .",
    "the li core radii are @xmath69    ( tn ) and @xmath70    ( bfd ) ( @xmath71 greater ) , while for a tolerance of @xmath72  a.u .",
    "the two radii are @xmath73  and @xmath74   , respectively ( a @xmath75 increase ) .",
    "we emphasise that the tabulated tn pseudopotentials are intended for use in qmc calculations,@xcite while the gaussian parameterisations are intended for use in quantum chemistry codes which require such a representation . for the latter ,",
    "the non - local radius is larger , taking the value @xmath76    for @xmath64  a.u .",
    "pseudopotentials are often used in _ ab initio _ calculations with very little account taken of the error introduced . in many cases , particularly for explicitly correlated calculations , the errors from the pseudopotential and the approximate method used to calculate the energies are not distinguished .",
    "we have chosen a system which is sufficiently small that we can solve it to very high accuracy using a variety of methods and for which a large amount of accurate experimental data is available .",
    "anharmonic effects are very important for the lih ground state and the prediction of its spectroscopic constants is a severe test of the theory .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that in the process of extracting the spectroscopic constants from the _ ab initio _ total energies an interatomic potential is generated with controlled accuracy .    we have compared pseudopotentials constructed from uncorrelated atomic calculations using different approaches , the `` shape - consistent '' or norm - conserving pseudopotentials of tn , and the `` energy - consistent '' pseudopotentials of bfd .",
    "the differences between the results obtained with the tn and bfd pseudopotentials are small compared with the differences from experiment .",
    "this conclusion holds whether or not the cpp is included . introducing the cpp",
    "substantially improves the zero - point energy @xmath41 , but the harmonic equilibrium separation @xmath17 , and well - depth @xmath26 , are poorer .",
    "the changes in the qmc estimates of @xmath17 , @xmath77 , and @xmath26 upon introducing the cpp are consistent with those found by previous authors using quantum chemistry methods , and their analysis of the source deficiencies of the cpp.@xcite however , the accurate description of the electron - electron cusp in the qmc calculations significantly improves the estimates of @xmath77 and @xmath26 over those found using quantum chemistry methods .",
    "it appears that using a hf - based pseudopotential which does not contain correlation effects and adding the cpp which approximately describes core relaxation and core - valence correlation effects provides a reasonable model of lih , but one which still suffers from significant errors . whether these errors can be reduced by using a li pseudopotential constructed using data from correlated calculations and/or by modifying the li cpp is currently unknown .",
