    "the boundary condition model ( bcm ) ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) is of interest due to its simplicity in describing the short - range component of the interaction between particles . in the bcm",
    "the interaction is specified by boundary conditions imposed on the wave function when the particles approach each other at a certain distance @xmath1 .",
    "the so - called hard core potentials represent a particular variant of the bcm where one requires that the wave function vanishes at @xmath1 .",
    "such a requirement is equivalent to an introduction of an infinitely strong repulsion between particles at distances @xmath2 .",
    "the standard formalism for scattering @xcite does not deal with hard - core interactions described by these boundary conditions .",
    "therefore a derivation of special equations to handle this class of interactions is desirable .",
    "replacement of the finite , for @xmath3 , but often singular at @xmath4 , repulsive short - range part of the potential with a hard - core interaction turns out to be a very effective way to suppress inaccuracies related to a numerical approximation of the schrdinger operator at short distances .",
    "although in two  body applications these potentials are easy to handle , in three - body systems certain mathematical difficulties appear @xcite , which are absent when conventional potentials are used .",
    "to overcome these difficulties various approaches were considered .",
    "we shall recall here the two main ones related to the faddeev equations @xcite . in the first",
    ", a certain limiting procedure is used where special potentials that include only a finite repulsive core are constructed at a first step .",
    "the parameters of these potentials are then chosen so that the final two - body wave function satisfies the desired boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the corresponding two - body @xmath5matrices are subsequently substituted into the faddeev integral equations @xcite under an implicit assumption that the latter are still valid .",
    "the resulting equations are considered as a generalization of the faddeev equations for the bcm .",
    "a similar approach was also used in refs .",
    "a common feature of the reduced equations in these approaches is that they are not of a fredholm type and that they have not a unique solution at all energy values , including the complex ones . to obtain a unique solution one",
    "is forced to introduce auxiliary conditions or relations @xcite .    in the second approach ,",
    "body integral equations of a fredholm type are derived in the bcm model without any limiting procedure .",
    "instead , one uses the fact that the spectral problem for the schrdinger operator is an example of a classical boundary  value problem for elliptic differential equation in partial derivatives of the second order .",
    "one of the traditional methods to deal with such problems is the potential theory @xcite .",
    "an approach to the three  body problem in the bcm which is based on the potential theory was developed in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , in contrast to the boundary value problems for compact surfaces , the initial three - body equations were not of fredholm type , similarly to the three ",
    "body lippmann ",
    "schwinger equation in the case of the conventional soft  core potentials .",
    "this is due to the same reason , i.e , the noncompactness of the support of the two - body interaction in the three - body configuration space . to overcome this problem ,",
    "these equations were rearranged in refs .",
    "@xcite using the faddeev method @xcite .",
    "the resultant equations are of fredholm type and suitable for use in the three - particle scattering problem .",
    "these developments allowed the reformulation of the faddeev equations for the bound state and scattering problems in configuration space in terms of boundary - value problems which are suitable for numerical calculations .",
    "this was demonstrated in three - nucleon bound - state and scattering calculations @xcite .    in this work",
    "we shall present a hard core version of the bcm formalism @xcite and apply it to the three - atomic @xmath0he system .",
    "various methods have been used in the past to study the ground state properties of @xmath0he molecules .",

    "@xcite . from the experimental works we mention those of refs .",
    "@xcite where molecular clusters consisting of a small number of noble gas atoms were investigated .",
    "the interaction between bosons in such clusters is usually described by central potentials having a very strong repulsive cores  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we approximate the strong repulsion between the helium atoms at short distances by a hard core and solve the corresponding boundary value problems for the faddeev  type differential equations .",
    "we shall show that the method gives excellent results for the ground - state energy of the helium @xmath0he trimer .",
    "it further allowed the calculation of an excited state interpreted in  @xcite as an efimov one  @xcite .",
