    "because of the very long coherence times , electronic states at the edge of a two - dimensional electron gas in the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) regime  @xcite are ideal systems for designing of coherent electronics circuitry or to implement quantum information processing . in particular , electronic versions of several optical interferometers have been realized  @xcite using continuous electron sources .",
    "recently it was also shown that high frequency gate modulation can realize single electron sources ( sess )  @xcite , that allow one to inject in a controlled and coherent way single electrons and holes onto an edge state . exploiting the beam splitting technique via quantum point contact ( qpc ) , the electronic wave packet produced by the ses could also be split , recombined , or coherently guided toward different paths , via the application of external gate voltages  @xcite . altogether ,",
    "sess , qpcs , and electronic waveguides represent the necessary toolbox toward the realization of an electronic version of the numerous protocols developed in quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "the only qualitative difference is in the measurement process , in that photons are usually absorbed by photodetectors and are studied in terms of @xmath0-photon coincidence correlation functions , whereas electrons are characterized by currents and higher - order momenta . in ref .",
    "[ ] this formal equivalence was used to characterize two - particle non - local effects originating via collision and proper post - selection from two independent sess whose output states were coherently mixed at a  qpc .",
    "a full exploitation of the capabilities of quantum information however requires the production and manipulation of entangled states .",
    "several schemes to generate entangled states in multi - terminal mesoscopic conductors have been proposed so far ( see  [ ] and references therein ) .",
    "the realization of the ses  @xcite opens possibilities to realize entangled states .",
    "here we exploit the coherence of time - resolved single - electron wave packets at the output of a single ses , operated in the weak tunneling regime to generate superpositions of an electron - hole ( _ e_-_h _ ) pair produced at different times . differently from ref .",
    "[ ] our scheme does not rely on collisional mechanisms followed by post - selection : as a consequence , in our case the _ e_-_h _ pair emerges from the device in an entangled state without the need of any filtering processes .",
    "the resulting output closely reminds us of the bi - photon state produced by a down - conversion nonlinear crystal ( see e.g. ref .  [ ] ) or , more precisely , the entangled photon holes states  @xcite produced via two - photon absorbing processes .",
    "it admits a representation in terms of time - bin entanglement  @xcite whose two - particle correlations we characterize by performing current cross - correlation measurements at the output of a franson interferometer  @xcite ( the latter being an interferometric setting which is specifically designed to detect coherence properties of sources emitting pairs of correlated particles ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we present the setup and describe in brief the basic idea of the proposal .",
    "the dynamics of the device is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : dyn ] and in sec .",
    "[ sec : nonidealcase ] we discuss deviation from the ideal case . conclusions and remarks are given in sec .",

    "( c ) implementation of a franson interferometer for an iqhe architecture at @xmath1 .",
    "a quantum dot driven by a gate potential @xmath2 generates an _",
    "pair on the edge channel at position @xmath3 .",
    "the electron and hole propagate freeley until they reach the qpc driven by the time - dependent voltage @xmath4 that splits them and send the electron toward the right - hand mzi  @xcite and the hole toward the left - hand one .",
    "the black elements are ohmic contacts to different reservoirs , all kept grounded.[fig1],width=302 ]",
    "we start with an intuitive description of the model whose validity will be checked later . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( c ) , the ses is described as a quantum dot whose energy levels are externally controlled via a time - dependent voltage gate @xmath2 , and which is connected to an edge state of the iqhe effect at a filling factor @xmath1 via a qpc characterized by a tunneling amplitude  @xmath5 which can be externally modulated  @xcite . in this setup",
    "the linear dispersion relation of the edge state close to the fermi energy gives rise to a constant velocity of propagation @xmath6 for the electronic wave packets : consequently , a particle generated by the ses at the position @xmath3 of the edge will be found translated by an amount @xmath7 after time @xmath8 has elapsed .",
    "as in refs .  [ and [ ] , we consider then an elementary driving sequence of duration @xmath9 consisting of two subsequent movements in which we first rapidly rise the dot energy level above the fermi sea and keep it there for a time @xmath10 , and then we rapidly lower it below the fermi sea and keep it there for a time @xmath10 . assuming @xmath10 to be much smaller than the dot escaping time @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , a pair of well - separated time - resolved electron and hole can be created on the edge channel with probability @xmath13 , the electron being localized in the first half of the time - bin and the hole being localized in the second half ( other processes in which no excitation or just a single excitation is emitted can be neglected since they do not contribute to the current cross - correlation measurements ) .",
    "this weak tunneling regime is crucial for the results we present and is actually opposite to the one usually considered in other proposals  @xcite ( to stress this fact from now on we will refer to our source as a weak tunneling ses , or wt - ses in brief ) . still it is well within the reach of current experimental capabilities : for instance , considering that @xmath11 of the order of @xmath14 ns can be achieved while preserving the coherence of the process  @xcite , the rising time of the dot energy level can be set to be of order of few ps , while @xmath10 can be taken to be of the order of a fraction of ns .",
    "notice also that during the driving we never leave the dot at resonance with the fermi level for an extended period of time : as experimentally verified in ref .",
    "[ and [ ] , this allows us to avoid the collateral generation of pairs induced by resonance effect between the fermi level and the dot  @xcite .",
    "consider hence the case in which the dot is initially charged and the elementary driving sequence is repeated several times , say , twice , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) . in the weak tunneling regime the global state of the system [ dot + one - dimensional ( 1d ) line ] at the lowest order in the tunneling amplitude",
    "@xmath5 contains three contributions .",
    "first , we have an unperturbed component in which the dot is still charged and no excitations are produced in the 1d channel ( zero - order contribution in @xmath5 ) .",
    "then there is a contribution proportional to @xmath5 in which the dot electron has emerged from the dot but no holes have been subsequently produced by the driving sequence .",
    "last , we have a term proportional to @xmath15 describing the case in which no charge is trapped in the dot and the 1d line contains a delocalized _ e_-_h _ pair : as anticipated , this is the only component of the state which can contribute to the current cross correlations we perform at the output of the setup , the probability of the event being proportional to @xmath16  see below . if the driving process is kept coherent , it is described as a coherent superposition of an _",
    "e_-_h _ pair emitted in the first time bin , an _",
    "e_-_h _ pair emitted in the second time bin and an _",
    "e_-_h _ pair with the electron emitted in the first time bin and a hole emitted in the second time bin ,  see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . we can hence represent it as the following vector : @xmath17 is the state with one electron ( hole ) in the first time bin ( first label in the ket ) and none in the second time bin ( second label in the ket ) , while @xmath18 is the state with no electron ( hole ) in the first time bin and one electron ( hole ) in the second time bin .",
    "we stress that @xmath19 is only the second order contribution in the tunneling amplitude @xmath5 to the real full state of the system , which we can use to evaluate the current cross correlations at the output of the device ( in other words , it is the component of the full state that gets post - selected by our measuring apparatus ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : ehtimebin ] ) represents an entangled state of two qubits : for instance , it violates the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality @xcite up to @xmath20 for suitable measurements  @xcite .",
    "specifically , identifying @xmath21 and @xmath22 with the eigenstates of @xmath23 , the value in ( [ chsh ] ) is achieved by using the following set of local observables @xmath24 for the electronic part of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ehtimebin ] ) , and @xmath25 for the hole part .",
    "the time - bin entanglement of the state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ehtimebin ] ) can be detected by means of a franson interferometer  @xcite .",
    "the two sub - systems ( here , the electron and the hole ) must be separated and sent to unbalanced mach - zehnder interferometers ( mzis ) , at the output of which coincidences are recorded .",
    "furthermore , on each side , single - qubit measurements can be implemented probabilistically by adapting the phase delays and the transmittivity of the second beam - splitter ( bs ) of the mzi .",
    "therefore , in principle , in the franson setup the value of chsh or of any other entanglement witness can be measured .",
    "this is well known and we refer the reader to the optical implementations for details @xcite . here",
    ", we rather have to discuss how a franson setup can be realized for our _ e_-_h _ pairs generator .",
    "the electron and the hole in each time bin are separated by means of a time - dependent qpc that acts as a switch , sending the electron and the hole , respectively , toward different mzis , which are implemented along the lines of ref .",
    "[ ] , as depicted in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "this separation is a challenging task : the potential @xmath4 of the qpc has to rise on a time scale equal or smaller to the inverse frequency of the gate potential @xmath2 on the dot , in such a way that the switch perfectly  cuts \" the wave function .",
    "the difference @xmath26 between the long and the short path in each mzi is chosen equal to @xmath27 .",
    "on the one hand , this guarantees that no single - particle interference arises within the mzis which then operate as effective , probabilistic ( but coherent ) delay lines . on the other hand , this allows us to align the time slot associated with the long path of a particle belonging to the first time bin with the time slot of the short path associated with second time bin .",
    "the current cross correlations are finally measured at the outputs of the setup , i.e. , @xmath28 with @xmath29 , where for @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the current operator at the @xmath33 port evaluated at time @xmath8 , and where @xmath34 stands for the expectation value on the initial state of the system ( notice that different times @xmath35 have to be chosen since the electron and hole are time shifted within the same time bin ) .",
    "this allows to post - select the events we are interested in , discarding single - particle currents .",
    "the transmittivities of the bss can be engineered as in ref .  [ ] and do not require special discussion .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we first assume to fix them at @xmath36 as in the original proposal by franson  @xcite : indeed , this choice is sufficient to detect a signal which is sensitive to the superposition of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ehtimebin ] ) [ instead to recover @xmath37 one would need to adjust the transmittivities as detailed at the end of the section ] . in order to have a phase difference between the two arms of a mzi ,",
    "we invoke instead the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect .",
    "accordingly , the statistics of the coincidence events will be sensitive to a non - local two - particle ab phase  @xcite that gives rise to interference fringes that can witness entanglement in the _",
    "e_-_h _ pair . to see this , consider that each of the three input terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ehtimebin ] ) is mapped after the mzis into the sum of four states .",
    "out of the 12 total contributions , three will be indistinguishable when revealing the proper coincidence counts : the event where the _ e_-_h _",
    "pair is generated in the first time - bin and both particles choose the long paths in the mzis , i.e. , @xmath38 are the ab phases computed with a gauge for which only particles traveling along the long arms of the mzis acquire a phase , the difference in sign arising from the opposite charge for electron and the hole ) ; the event where the _ e_-_h _",
    "pair is generated in the second time bin and both the particles choose the short paths of the mzis , i.e. , @xmath39 finally , the event where the electron is generated in the first time bin , the hole in the second time bin and choose , respectively , the long and the short paths , i.e. , @xmath40 measuring then coincidence events in the second time - bin at the output of the mzis ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) will then produce a signal which is sensitive to the coherent superposition of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ehtimebin ] ) , i.e. , @xmath42 the three terms correspond to the three vectors which compose eq .",
    "( [ eq : ehtimebin ] ) and display coherent oscillations . in particular , a dependence on a non - local two - particle ab phase appears as the difference of the ab phases of the left- and right - hand mzis .",
    "we analyze in more details how to use our franson setting to measure the value of chsh@xmath43 .",
    "we remind that to do so we need to perform local measurements on the two subsystems ( electron and hole separately ) . as anticipated , this can be done in a probabilistic fashion by properly adjusting the transmittivities of the bs of the setup .",
    "indeed , let us consider the effect of an asymmetric mzi , characterized by transmission @xmath44 and reflection @xmath45 amplitudes of the second bs , while keeping the first bs symmetric .",
    "let us suppose also that the generic state of , say , the electron before the right - hand mzi can be written as @xmath46 . by focusing on the second time bin at the outputs of the mzi",
    ", the electron will come out with an amplitude @xmath47 from the output 1 and with amplitude @xmath48 from output 2 . defining the rotated input qubit states @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and",
    "it becomes clear that in the second time - bin outputs one reads the results of the measurements of @xmath51 on the eigenstates of @xmath52 where the pauli matrices are written in the basis @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the probability of success is @xmath55 , provided that @xmath56 .",

    "[ fig1 ] , and the observables  ( [ sigmah ] ) by taking instead @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and @xmath62 for the mzi on the left - hand side .",
    "we now turn to a more quantitative model where the dynamics of the wt - ses is described via a time - dependent hamiltonian  @xcite of the form @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are , respectively , the fermionic annihilation operators of the dot energy level and of the 1-d free - electron modes associated with the chiral iqhe edge channel at @xmath1 , while @xmath66 is the tunneling term .",

    "we consider a ( time dependent ) tunneling amplitude peaked around the resonance value @xmath69 associated with the instantaneous dot energy  @xcite within a bandwidth @xmath70 , i.e. , @xmath71}(d^{\\dag}c_k+c^{\\dag}_kd ) \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and assume @xmath72 .",
    "the spread @xmath73 is associated with the uncertainty in the emission position of the electron on the 1d channel , taking into account the not perfect point - like coupling between the dot and the edge , allowing hence the tunneling hopping to extend over a range @xmath74 . a natural bound on @xmath75 can be set as @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the linear dimension of the quantum dot .",
    "the latter , however , is directly related with the dot energy - level spacing @xmath78 via the expression @xmath79 , @xmath80 being the effective mass of the electron ( @xmath81 for gaas heterostructures ) .",

    "consider now the time evolution of the input state @xmath105 , where @xmath106 describe the charged state of the dot and @xmath107 is the free fermi - sea state of the edge .",

    "a theoretical study has shown that , for a single - electron wave packet injected in chiral luttinger liquid , the deformation of the wavepacket due to electron - electron interaction can be partly undone by a suitable voltage pulse [ ] , whereas in a real device a capacitive coulomb interaction may add dissipation into the system  [ ] .",
