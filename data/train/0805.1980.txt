    "we obtain a precise description of the polynomials @xmath17 and @xmath18 which is uniformly valid for all @xmath19 , for all @xmath8 sufficiently large .",

    "new riemann - hilbert techniques originally developed for the asymptotic analysis of problems in integrable nonlinear partial differential equations were applied to the asymptotic analysis of riemann - hilbert problems encoding systems of orthogonal polynomials with respect to varying weights on @xmath6 , first for the case of external fields of the form @xmath20 @xcite , and then for the case of general real analytic @xmath1 in @xcite .",
    "( see @xcite for more information about plancherel - rotach type asymptotics for orthogonal polynomials prior to the use of riemann - hilbert techniques . )",
    "the riemann - hilbert method has been extended , and applied to various types of asymptotic questions in approximation theory ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) . with the exception of @xcite and @xcite ,",

    "by contrast with that method , a fundamental new feature of orthogonal polynomials with varying weights _ on the real line _ is the presence of `` transition points '' ( also known as endpoints of the equilibrium measure ) in the neighborhood of which the asymptotic behavior exhibits a complicated transition from oscillatory to exponential behavior .      among many applications of the asymptotic theory of orthogonal polynomials",

    "one of the origins of the theory of random matrices in physics was the study of nuclear resonance levels in the 1950s .",
    "see @xcite and the references contained therein for more information .      a remarkable connection to orthogonal polynomials was discovered in the late 1960s by gaudin and mehta @xcite .",
    "the connection is the following formula for the density of the probability measure on eigenvalues induced by : @xmath28 where the function @xmath29 is the so - called _ reproducing kernel _ of orthogonal polynomials : @xmath30 the polynomials @xmath31 being defined in .",
    "it is a basic result of the theory that indeed defines a probability measure on @xmath32 .    from formula one",
    "may effectively compute many statistical quantities involving the eigenvalues ( see @xcite , and also @xcite ) .",
    "two examples are as follows :    * _ mean density of eigenvalues _ @xmath33 defined as @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the expectation of @xmath36 with respect to the probability measure or equivalently .",
    "this may be equivalently represented in terms of the orthogonal polynomials : @xmath37 * _ gap probabilities _",

    "it is also known that if @xmath1 is real analytic , the convergence in is uniform . for those nonanalytic @xmath1 for which existence of the limiting density @xmath51 can be established",
    ", the convergence implied by the statement has only been proven in a weaker sense .",
    "one consequence of the present work is that the convergence in is in fact uniform assuming only that the function @xmath1 possesses 2 lipschitz continuous derivatives .",
    "the function @xmath52 is also a well - known quantity in approximation theory , where it is referred to as the density of the _ equilibrium measure_. the equilibrium measure is defined in subsection [ subsec : eqmeas ] ( for the purposes of the current discussion one may take the parameter @xmath53 appearing in the definition of the equilibrium measure to be unity ) .    in many circumstances , the largest eigenvalue distribution has been shown to possess a limit as @xmath54 known as the _ tracy - widom distribution _ , a distribution function expressible in closed form in terms of the hastings - mcleod solution of the painlev ii equation .",
    "the form of the asymptotic result is : @xmath55 where the constant @xmath56 depends on the external field @xmath1 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is the famous tracy - widom distribution .",
    "another fundamental object concerning the eigenvalues of random matrices is the limiting spacing distribution . properly speaking ,",
    "this is defined in terms of the _ spacing _ between ordered eigenvalues ; however a `` poor - man s '' version of this distribution is the following ( easier to define ) quantity : @xmath59 this limit is known to exist provided the external field is real analytic and provided that @xmath60 is such that @xmath61 , and it turns out that the function @xmath62 which emerges in the limit is _ universal _ in that it does not depend on properties of the function @xmath1 . indeed , under the assumption that @xmath1 is real analytic , one has @xmath63 where @xmath64 is an integral operator on the interval @xmath65 : @xmath66    0.2 in via the connection to orthogonal polynomials explained earlier , the following asymptotic result concerning the reproducing kernel @xmath29 built from the orthogonal polynomials implies :    there is a constant @xmath56 so that for every @xmath67 , we have @xmath68 here @xmath69 denotes the unique solution to airy s equation @xmath70 that is real , and that behaves as follows as @xmath71 : @xmath72 .",
    "[ ar : airykernel ]    similarly , the limit appearing in is implied by the following result :    for every @xmath60 with @xmath61 , and every @xmath67 , we have @xmath73 [ ar : sinekernel ]    asymptotic result [ ar : airykernel ] was first established in the special case of the gaussian unitary ensemble ( i.e. @xmath49 ) @xcite , using the classical plancherel - rotach asymptotics of hermite polynomials @xcite .",
    "this was extended to quartic potentials of the form @xmath74 in @xcite , where furthermore asymptotic result [ ar : sinekernel ] was also established . because the polynomials associated with quartic @xmath1 are not known to possess elementary contour integral representations , the analysis of @xcite required a new method , namely the use of the riemann - hilbert formulation of orthogonal polynomials found in @xcite .",
    "asymptotic result [ ar : sinekernel ] was established for general real analytic potentials @xmath1 in @xcite , and the asymptotic formulae for orthogonal polynomials given in @xcite were used to establish asymptotic result [ ar : airykernel ] in @xcite .",
    "the new strategy introduced in @xcite was a general method linking the equilibrium measure associated with @xmath1 to a so - called @xmath75-function enabling the use of the non - commutative steepest descent technique for riemann - hilbert problems originally invented by deift and zhou @xcite and extended in @xcite .",
    "pastur and shcherbina @xcite have also studied the problem of establishing asymptotic result [ ar : sinekernel ] under the assumption that @xmath1 has three continuous derivatives .",
    "as is clear from the above discussion , the historical trend is toward establishing asymptotic results [ ar : airykernel ] and [ ar : sinekernel ] for more and more general external fields @xmath1 .",
    "the program of _ universality _ in random matrix theory is concerned with determining the most general external fields @xmath1 under which such results hold true . in particular , it is of some interest to admit external fields that are not real analytic . as pointed out by deift in @xcite , the steepest descent method that works so well for analytic @xmath1 can not be easily applied to the nonanalytic case .",
    "the authors recently introduced a `` @xmath21 steepest descent method '' applicable to some riemann - hilbert problems involving nonanalytic data , but as formulated in @xcite this method does not apply to the orthogonal polynomials described by conditions  because the equilibrium measure is compactly supported and the endpoints of support obstruct the type of nonanalytic deformations involved in the method .    among the applications of the results in this manuscript",
    "are proofs of asymptotic results [ ar : airykernel ] and [ ar : sinekernel ] under weakened hypotheses on the external field @xmath1 ( we require two lipschitz continuous derivatives ) via rigorous plancherel - rotach type asymptotics for orthogonal polynomials .",
    "our method involves a hybrid `` riemann - hilbert-@xmath21 steepest descent method '' generalizing the simpler method of @xcite to handle support endpoints .",
    "our results hold under weaker conditions on @xmath1 than those under which asymptotic result [ ar : sinekernel ] is considered in the paper @xcite , and to our knowledge we have the first proof that asymptotic result [ ar : airykernel ] holds in the absence of analyticity of @xmath1 .",
    "we remark that it is not necessary to first obtain asymptotics for the orthogonal polynomials themselves in order to deduce enough information about the reproducing kernels @xmath76 to establish asymptotic results [ ar : airykernel ] and [ ar : sinekernel ] for certain general external fields @xmath1 .",
    "for example , a recently introduced method ( based on a comparison principle for christoffel functions ) of levin and lubinsky has been quite successful in establishing asymptotic result [ ar : sinekernel ] @xcite under extremely weak global conditions on the external field @xmath1 and stronger local conditions ( but still far from analyticity ) near the point @xmath60 of expansion in the spectrum .",
    "also , asymptotic result [ ar : airykernel ] has been studied for real analytic @xmath1 without the use of orthogonal polynomials by pastur and shcherbina @xcite .      in the asymptotic analysis of riemann - hilbert problems",
    "there is an analog of contour deformations which plays a crucial role in identifying subsets of the plane which produce the dominant contribution to the riemann - hilbert problem s solution .",
    "it is common to begin with a riemann - hilbert problem whose solution , @xmath77 , is analytic off a given contour @xmath78 , and to use explicit piecewise analytic quantities to define a new matrix @xmath79 solving a new equivalent riemann - hilbert problem in which the relevant contour @xmath80 is a deformation of the original contour @xmath78 .",
    "a fundamental obstacle to this procedure occurs when one requires the analytic extension from a given contour of a rapidly oscillating function whose phase possesses no analyticity properties . for the asymptotic analysis of orthogonal polynomials with varying weights on the real line , in which the external field @xmath1 possesses only finitely many derivatives ,",
    "this is a central issue .    in this paper , the new approach which circumvents",
    "this problem is to depart from riemann - hilbert problems entirely , by introducing transformations that explicitly violate analyticity . instead of riemann - hilbert problems ,",
    "we then characterize our newly - defined matrix - valued function as the unique solution of a @xmath21 problem .",
    "given a smooth matrix - valued function @xmath81 of compact support in @xmath82 , a @xmath21 problem is a first - order system of linear partial differential equations on @xmath83 involving @xmath81 as coefficients and the cauchy - riemann operator @xmath84 acting on the unknown . here is a prototypical example .    determine a @xmath85 matrix @xmath86 for @xmath87 having the following properties :    * * continuity .",

    "* normalization . *",
    "the matrix @xmath86 is normalized as follows : @xmath94    [ dbp : prototype ]    once one admits the possibility to use non - analytic extensions of functions originally defined on contours , one is faced with an overabundance of choices , and the issue becomes one of selecting , constructing , or otherwise establishing the existence of , an extension suitable for subsequent asymptotic analysis .",
    "this idea actually yields an interesting approach to a classical result of asymptotic analysis .",
    "given a real - valued function @xmath95 \\to \\mathbb{r}$ ] satisfying @xmath96 , @xmath97 , the problem is to provide a large @xmath12 asymptotic description for the integral @xmath98 for convenience , let us assume that @xmath99 is bounded and @xmath100 for all @xmath101 $ ] .",
    "the usual approach to this problem ( see , for example , @xcite ) involves many steps , including integration by parts , implicit variable changes , and taylor expansions , the result of which is @xmath102 we may instead establish this in the following way , which elucidates certain aspects of the methods we use in the sequel . let @xmath103 represent an arbitrary extension of @xmath104 , which satisfies @xmath105",

    "this begs the question : can we pick the extension @xmath103 and the contour @xmath107 so that the right - hand side of may be easily estimated ?",
    "the answer is yes .",
    "we take @xmath107 to be the contour comprised of a vertical segment from @xmath115 to @xmath116 , followed by the line segment connecting @xmath116 to @xmath117 , and ending with the vertical line segment from @xmath117 to @xmath118 , and let @xmath119 and @xmath120 denote the interior of the two triangles formed by this contour and the real interval @xmath111 $ ] , @xmath119 in the first quadrant , and @xmath120 in the third quadrant , exactly as illustrated in figure  [ fig : statphase ] .",

    "firstly , @xmath593 is analytic at least for @xmath594 , where @xmath595 is the union of @xmath498 and the boundaries of the square regions @xmath255 and @xmath257 , and @xmath593 takes continuous boundary values on @xmath595 .",

    "thirdly , @xmath593 must tend to the identity matrix as @xmath598 .",
    "in other words , these three facts show that @xmath593 satisfies its own riemann - hilbert problem .",
    "the riemann - hilbert problem satisfied by @xmath593 is of a particularly convenient type : it is a `` small - norm '' problem in the sense that the jump matrix @xmath597 is a small perturbation of the identity matrix in a suitable space of matrix - valued functions on the contour @xmath595 .",
    "in fact , it is easy to check by direct calculation that @xmath599 for @xmath600 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of property 3 in lemma  [ lem : thetaextendgeneral ] and lemma  [ lem : phiextendgeneral ] characterizing respectively the extensions @xmath103 and @xmath327 on these portions of the contour @xmath498 , and of the identity @xmath601 an even easier calculation shows that @xmath599 for @xmath602 . with the use of the asymptotic formulae",

    "to do this we need to observe that as a consequence of our assumptions on the external field @xmath1 and the corresponding smoothness of @xmath103 and @xmath327 described in property 1 of lemma  [ lem : thetaextendgeneral ] and lemma  [ lem : phiextendgeneral ] , and also as a consequence of the piecewise analyticity of the comparison matrix @xmath566 , the jump matrix @xmath597 is sufficiently smooth on a sufficiently ( piecewise ) smooth contour that the hlder version of the small - norm theory applies .",
    "the result is that as @xmath136 , @xmath593 exists uniquely in the space of matrices with hlder - continuous boundary values , and also @xmath606 holds uniformly throughout the complex @xmath208-plane .",
    "a detailed account of the existence theory for small - norm riemann - hilbert problems is discussed , for example , in @xcite .",
    "specific information relevant to the application of small - norm theory in hlder spaces can be found in appendix a of @xcite .",

    "the construction of @xmath566 is one part of the argument where the details are somewhat different for @xmath239 than for @xmath238 . to handle the case with more than one interval of support",
    "one must replace the definition of @xmath566 for @xmath614 with a matrix constructed from riemann theta functions for hyperelliptic curves of nonzero genus modeled by two copies of the complex @xmath208-plane identified along cuts made on the real axis in the support intervals of the equilibrium measure @xmath204 .",
    "full details may be found , for example , in @xcite .",
    "the key property of uniform boundedness of @xmath566 away from the endpoints of the support intervals remains valid in this more general case .",

    "the matrix @xmath616 is normalized as follows : @xmath622    in view of the normalization condition and the fact that @xmath623 outside some compact set , we may invert the @xmath21 operator in with the help of the cauchy kernel : @xmath624 where @xmath625 it is a basic fact that if @xmath616 satisfies the integral equation then @xmath616 also solves @xmath21 problem  [ dbp:01 ] ; in fact the integral equation is equivalent to @xmath21 problem  [ dbp:01 ] .    in this section",
    "we will show that the integral operator @xmath626 , when considered in the space @xmath627 , has norm bounded by @xmath628 for some @xmath423 .",
    "this implies that the integral equation may be solved by neumann series .",
    "the strategy to prove this is quite straightforward : because the singularity of the cauchy kernel is integrable in @xmath82 , the basic estimate is : @xmath629 , \\label{eq : kopnorm}\\ ] ] where @xmath630 is a pointwise matrix norm , i.e. a norm of the matrix @xmath92 evaluated at @xmath631 .",
    "since @xmath92 is uniformly bounded and has compact support , this immediately implies that @xmath626 is a bounded operator on @xmath627 .",
    "the goal is then to prove that the integral appearing on the right hand side of is small , and for this the @xmath631 dependence of @xmath632 will be essential .",

    "we begin by describing the asymptotic behavior of @xmath81 . according to",

    "therefore , we have @xmath644    now we will show that there is a constant @xmath423 such that @xmath645 indeed , since @xmath646 , on the one hand we have @xmath647 we will use this estimate when @xmath648 is large . on the other hand , for @xmath648 small we have the following .",
    "firstly , since @xmath649 , @xmath650 secondly , we have may evaluate @xmath651 explicitly as @xmath652 from which it follows that @xmath653 @xmath654 and @xmath655 the estimates and  may be combined for @xmath648 sufficiently small to give @xmath656 this estimate is useful for @xmath648 small . taking with yields .    using in and extending the integration from @xmath657 to @xmath658 yields @xmath659 for some modified positive constant @xmath122 independent of @xmath87 and @xmath12 . now rescaling the integration variable by @xmath660",
    "gives @xmath661 the first integral is clearly finite and independent of @xmath12 , and since by cauchy - schwarz , @xmath662^{1/2 } \\left[\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\log\\left(1+\\frac{1}{|s|}\\right)^2\\,ds\\right]^{1/2}\\ ] ] the second integral is bounded by a finite quantity independent of @xmath12 .",
    "this proves that @xmath663 holds for some constant @xmath423 independent of @xmath12 , for @xmath12 sufficiently large .",
    "the neumann series for the integral equation corresponding to @xmath21 problem  [ dbp:01 ] therefore converges in @xmath664 for sufficiently large @xmath12 , and the estimate follows immediately .",
    "we will restrict our attention to @xmath252 in `` the bulk '' ( i.e. away from the endpoints @xmath256 and @xmath258 ) and also to the upper half - plane in the vicinity of the endpoint @xmath258 .",

    "we will use the notation @xmath666      the leading coefficients @xmath667 and @xmath668 are obtained from @xmath271 using . in a neighborhood of @xmath287 ,",
