    "recent experimental developments in manufacturing quantum dots@xcite and rings@xcite with only a few electrons have made quantum rings an ever increasing topic of experimental and theoretical research . in a quantum ring",
    "the electrons move in a ring - shaped quasi - one - dimensional confinement .",
    "the one - dimensionality makes the electrons strongly correlated . among the quantum effects seen in such systems",
    "are the aharonov - bohm oscillations@xcite and persistent currents@xcite .",
    "many properties of the quantum rings can be explained with single - electron theory , which in a strictly one - dimensional ( 1d ) system is naturally very simple . on the contrary , the many - particle fermion problem in 1d systems is surprisingly complicated due to enhanced importance of the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "it is then customary to say that strictly 1d systems are not fermi liquids but luttinger liquids with specific collective excitations ( for reviews see@xcite ) .",
    "= 3.7 in    we consider two models for quantum rings . in the _ continuum model _ the electrons move in an external two - dimensional potential ( shown schematically in fig .",
    "1a ) usually considered to be harmonic : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the radius of the ring and @xmath5 the strength of the radial confinement .",
    "the electron - electron interaction is the normal long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "if the number of electrons is small , the many - electron states in this external potential can be solved ( numerically ) exactly using standard configuration interaction ( ci ) methods@xcite .",
    "another theoretical approach@xcite to quantum rings has been a model where the ring consists of discrete lattice sites , as shown in fig .",
    "the many - particle hamiltonian can be approximated with the hubbard model@xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the hubbard parameters determining the hopping between neighbouring sites and the on - site energy , @xmath9 is the number of electrons and the number of sites , respectively , and @xmath10 is the magnetic flux through the ring ( in units of the flux quantum @xmath11 ) .",
    "the advantage of the discrete model is that the many - body problem is much easier than that of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , and can be solved exactly in some limiting cases .",
    "the two theoretical approaches , although seemingly very different , give in many cases qualitatively similar results .",
    "the aim of this work is to compare these models quantitatively and study the reasons for the similarities of these two approaches ( for an introductory review see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "= 3.7 in    figure 2 shows the energy spectra of quantum rings with six electrons , calculated from the continuum model and from the lattice model with eight sites . in both cases",
    "the excitation spectrum contains a low energy band of _ rotational _ states with energy increasing in the continuum model roughly as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the total angular momentum and @xmath14 the moment of inertia @xmath15 .",
    "the low energy electron spectrum thus corresponds to rigid rotation of a ring of six electrons while the higher bands correspond to vibrational excitations .",
    "moreover , the energy splitting ( due to spin ) can be quantitatively described with an antiferromagnetic heisenberg model@xcite .",
    "thus one arrives at the following model hamiltonian @xmath16 where the last term describes vibrational states of electrons localized on the ring ( in fig .",
    "2 the vibrational states are the ones not marked with the spin number ) .",
    "figure 2 shows that nearly exactly the same low energy spectrum can be obtained from the hubbard model with suitably chosen parameters .",
    "it is known that in the limit of large @xmath8 the half - filled hubbard model ( @xmath17 ) approaches the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model , explaining the correct spin structure of the model hamiltonian above",
    ". however , the correspondence seems to go even further : if @xmath18 the rigid rotations and vibrational states also appear in agreement with the continuum model .",
    "the similarity of the discrete lattice model with contact interaction and the continuum model with long - range interaction can be traced back to the special properties of one - dimensional systems .",
    "the strong contact interaction effectively prevents electrons to pass each other and the kinetic energy repulsion makes the strong @xmath19-function interaction look like a @xmath20 interaction as evident from the calogero - sutherland model@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is surprising that the similarity survives to quasi - one - dimensional rings considered in fig .",
    "2 .    = 3.7 in    the localization of electrons along the ring happens at all electron numbers .",
    "similar traces of electron localization can be found in the energy spectra of two - dimensional quantum dots@xcite .",
    "figure 3 shows the energy spectra of quantum rings and dots with four electrons . in both cases",
    "the classical localization geometry is a square .",
    "indeed the low - energy spectrum is similar for a ring and for a dot .",
    "the hubbard model gives again qualitatively the same spectra as the continuum model ( not shown here)@xcite .",
    "the persistent current of a quantum ring can be determined from the flux dependence of the total energy@xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the magnetic flux through the ring .",
    "since the discrete hubbard model gives the same energy levels as the continuum model , we can use it to study the persistent current .",
    "the hamiltonian ( 2 ) can be solved numerically for small number of electrons and sites . due to the phase factors",
    "the energy levels , and consequently the persistent current , will be periodic functions of the flux .",
    "figure 4 shows the spectrum of a hubbard ring of four electrons in eight sites , as a function of @xmath22 for different values of @xmath8 .",
    "for @xmath23 the ground state energy has a periodicity @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath8 increases the period changes first to @xmath1 and eventually to @xmath2 .",
    "this happens at all electron numbers and in a similar fashion for continuum@xcite and discrete@xcite rings .",
    "the increase of the strength of the radial confinement , @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , of the continuum model corresponds to the increase of the on - site energy @xmath8 of the hubbard model . in both cases",
    "the ring becomes more strictly one - dimensional in the sense that electrons are prevented to pass each other ."
