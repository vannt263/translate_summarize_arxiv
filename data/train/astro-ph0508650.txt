    "many images of the globular cluster = c1207 + 188 exist in public astronomical data archives around the world , primarily because it is included among the six photometric calibration fields defined by the `` kpno video camera / ccd standards consortium '' ( christian  1985 ) . yet , surprisingly few detailed studies of its color - magnitude diagram and variable - star properties are available in the literature .    according to the summary of cluster properties compiled by harris ( 1996 ) ( revision : february 2003 ) , the cluster lies at the position @xmath210062 , @xmath33231(j2000 ) , @xmath4253 , @xmath5 , thus near the boundary between the third and fourth galactic quadrants and not far from the north galactic pole .",
    "its foreground reddening is accordingly quite small , @xmath6 . lies some 19@xmath7kpc from the sun and 21@xmath7kpc from the galactic center , making it clearly a member of the halo rather than the disk subpopulation of globular clusters .",
    "in fact , it lies pretty much within the transition zone between the inner and outer components of the galactic halo ( , carney  1990 , 1991 ) .",
    "the cluster metallicity is listed as [ fe / h]@xmath81.8 ; apparently nothing is known about its [ @xmath9/fe ] ratio .",
    "ngc@xmath74147 is intrinsically rather small : among the 146 galactic globular clusters with estimated absolute visual magnitudes in harris s compilation , with @xmath10 ranks 112@xmath11 in total intrinsic luminosity , comparable to notoriously sparse clusters like palomar  4 .",
    "however , the cluster s half - light radius is estimated at 2.4  pc ( van  den  bergh & mackey 2004 ) , which is more typical of inner - halo clusters than outer - halo ones .",
    "djorgovski & king ( 1986 ) list as _ possibly _ being among the @xmath1220% of galactic globular clusters with central density cusps believed to be the result of gravothermal core collapse , although aurire & lauzeral ( 1991 ) suggest that the central brightness cusp might be explained by the presence of a mere three bright giants in the inner 4  of the cluster .",
    "does not seem to be a candidate post - core - collapse cluster either in the surface photometry of trager  ( 1993 ) or in the velocity - dispersion data of pryor & meylan ( 1993 ) .",
    "an early photometric study of was published by sandage & walker ( 1955 ) , based upon both photoelectric and photographic measurements from mount wilson observatory and palomar observatory .",
    "they regarded the cluster as an important test of the modern theory of stellar evolution , which has since become universally accepted but was then quite new .",
    "they also reported the discovery of ten new variable stars , presumably of the rr lyrae type , which were assigned the designations v5v14 ; one variable star had previously been discovered by davis ( 1917 ) , and three more had been reported by baade ( 1930 ) .    more recent work on has been rather sparse , perhaps in part because of its relatively great distance and isolation in a direction well apart from most other globular clusters .",
    "aurire & lauzeral ( 1991 ) published @xmath13 ccd photometry of a 100@xmath14160  region around the center of the cluster , based upon a night of observations in 1012 seeing conditions at the observatoire du pic du midi .",
    "they found a fairly steep red giant branch ( rgb ) typical of metal - poor globular clusters , along with a prominent blue horizontal branch ( hb ) not unlike that of ngc  288 ( except for the clear presence of a more substantial rr lyrae component ) .",
    "however , their photometry did not go deep enough to reach the main - sequence turnoff of the cluster . since then , wang et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have also presented color - magnitude diagrams for this cluster , although they barely reached the hb level .",
    "piotto  ( 2002 ) reported on hst photometry for the innermost regions of the cluster , which although revealing the main - sequence turnoff point for the first time , appeared to extend @xmath15  mag below it .",
    "this , along with the fact that the hb of the cluster was not particularly well defined in the hst study , especially at its `` horizontal '' level ( , around the rr lyrae region ) , have led to few attempts to utilize these data for reliable age dating of the cluster .",
    "the first detailed study of the variable - star population in was carried out by newburn ( 1957 ) , who added three more entries to the catalog of variable - star candidates in the cluster . in this paper",
    ", newburn also retracted his earlier claim that candidate v9 was a variable , which he had made in a private communication to a.  r.  sandage .",
    "another study of six of the best cluster rr  lyrae candidates was carried out at about the same time by mannino ( 1957 ) .",
    "as of may 2005 christine clement s web sitecclement / read.html ] ( clement  2001 ) still lists those 17 objects as the only known or suspected photometric variables in the field of ; among them , the periods listed for seven are flagged as dubious and v9 is indicated as `` probably not var . ''",
    "on the basis of these data ,  has stood out from other galactic globular clusters due to its reportedly unusual rr lyrae star properties . in particular , castellani & quarta ( 1987 )",
    "classified this cluster as belonging to oosterhoff ( 1939 ) type i ( oo  i ) despite the fact that it possesses a low metal abundance and a blue hb .",
    "such a classification seems inconsistent with the scenario  which gained significant impetus in the late-1980s / early-1990 s with the work by lee  ( 1990 ) , and later on by clement & shelton ( 1999)whereby rr  lyrae stars in oo  i globular clusters ( predominantly red or intermediate hbs ) are relatively unevolved objects , whereas those in",
    "oo  ii globulars ( predominantly blue hbs ) are evolved from a position on the blue zero - age hb ( zahb ) .",
    "however , when this potential conflict with the evolutionary interpretation was identified , the possibility was soon raised that at least some of the rr lyrae periods reported in the literature were in fact incorrect .",
    "for this reason , clement ( 2000 ) stressed the need for additional work on the variable stars in this cluster .",
    "arellano  ferro  ( 2004 ; hereinafter af04 ) have recently provided new periods and light curves in the @xmath1 and @xmath16 photometric bandpasses for the 17 previously known  variable candidates , and for an eighteenth candidate variable that they identified in the cluster field .",
    "the work is derived from 23 nights of observations from three observatories sampling a total range of 171.6 days in 2003 . the number of individual magnitudes reported by af04 for any given star ranged from a minimum of 68 ( v18 ) to a maximum of 551 ( v9 ) .",
    "this work confirmed that some of the older periods for the variable stars were incorrect , but nevertheless the cluster s",
    "oo  i classification was also confirmed .",
    "af04 did not provide a color - magnitude diagram for .",
    "in the remainder of this paper we present the results of our analysis of 524 ground - based images of as well as five exposures obtained with the wfpc2 camera on the _ hubble space telescope_. these data span the period 19832003 , and are independent of those employed by af04 .",
    "section 2 below describes the nature and the provenance of our ccd images .",
    "section 3 presents some details of the methodology by which we determined fundamental positions and magnitudes for stars in the cluster field .",
    "section 4 discusses new color - magnitude and color - color diagrams for the cluster . in section 5",
    "we present new period determinations and inferred physical properties for the known variables in the cluster field based upon a combination of our own data with the independent data of newburn , mannino , and af04 . here",
    "we also include results for a new c - type rr lyrae star that is identified here for the first time .",
    "finally , we present a brief discussion of the significance of the present results .",

    "in addition to the 452 ground - based exposures and five wfpc2 exposures listed in table  1 , which produced a total of 534 distinct ccd images , we also had seven ground - based exposures ( ten images ) in one or another flavor of the @xmath18 bandpass .",

    "they might be  or might someday become  secondary standard fields ( see stetson 2000 ) .",
    "mean bias , flat - field , and , when necessary , fringe frames were constructed in accordance with procedures that have by now become well established , and the images of science targets were corrected for these instrumental signatures in the usual way .",

    "the total body of imagery for spans an area of roughly 71east - west versus 39  north - south , centered on @xmath210124 , @xmath33638  ( j2000 ) . however , the outer limits of this field are defined by the cfh12k data , which exist only for the @xmath1 filter . those stars for which @xmath0 , @xmath1 , _ and _ @xmath17 photometry ( at least ) are available are contained within the bounds 1208344@xmath201210558 , + 182047@xmath21 + 184707(j2000 ) .",
    "a congeries of images representing this 34@xmath1426  area of sky is presented here as fig .  1 .",
    "the ground - based and  observations of were analysed separately , as experimental reductions of ground - based and  data together have so far proven disappointing .",
    "one would think that we could use the  imagery to establish an ironclad star list and set of centroid positions , which could then be imposed as prior conditions on the analysis of ground - based images in a solution for photometric parameters alone within the area of overlap .",
    "we have not yet stumbled upon an effective way to make this work .",
    "it is often the case that a bright star is seen to have numerous fainter companions in the   images .",
    "however , when this information is used in the analysis of the ground - based data , only the stars relative _ positions _ are carried along from the  to the ground - based reductions , not their relative _ magnitudes _ ; otherwise , it would be impossible to fairly treat stars of differing colors , or stars whose brightnesses vary with time .",
    "it seems that under these circumstances  when a given blob of light in the ground - based data encompasses several distinct but unequal detections in the  imagery  the software at present has too much freedom to distribute the ground - based photons among the various  detections as it attempts to optimally model the detailed distribution of light in the observed blob .",
    "the net result is a compact clump of objects that individually appear to brighten and dim spasmodically in response to the varying distribution of noise in the object s profile as recorded in the different ground - based images . in most cases",
    "it seems preferable , at least with the current generation of software , to ignore the fact that brighter stars may have fainter companions visible in the images .",
    "instead , we reduce the ground - based data independently of the star lists , and cross - identify the stars _ ex post facto_. it will generally be obvious from the wfpc2 data which stars sufficiently dominate their companions that such a comparison will be meaningful , and which stars will be so badly blended in the ground - based data that no reasonable comparison is possible .      employing the services of the canadian astronomy data centre ,",
    "we extracted from the u.  s.  naval observatory `` usno - a2.0 '' guide - star catalog ( monet  1998 ) all 7,941 sources within a square box 1200 on a side centered on coordinates @xmath2101379 , @xmath331224 ( j2000 ) .",
    "these coordinates represent the origin of the differential @xmath22 coordinate system that we will henceforth employ for identifying detected objects . also through the data",
    "centre , we extracted images 80  on a side , centered on the same coordinates , from the stsci digitized sky survey  1 `` o '' plate , and the digitized sky survey  2 `` b , '' `` r , '' and `` i '' plates .",
    "these were analyzed with a modernized version of the stetson ( 1979 ) software .",
    "the program daomaster ( stetson 1993 ) was then used to transform the data from these star lists and from our own allframe ( stetson 1994 ) analysis of the ground - based ccd images to a common reference system based upon the usno2 coordinates .",
    "ten - parameter cubic fits in @xmath23 and @xmath24 were used to effect the transformations .",
    "the @xmath22 coordinates in our composite star list should now be accurately aligned with the cardinal directions , with @xmath23 increasing east and @xmath24 increasing north .",
    "positions are expressed in units of arcseconds with the origin of the coordinate system at the celestial coordinates given above .",
    "measurements from the wfpc2 images were subsequently transformed to the same system by comparing the coordinates of detected objects to positions derived from the ground - based ccd images , again employing a 10-parameter cubic transformation for each of the two spatial dimensions .",
    "the precision at the present epoch of the usno2 positions is generally in the range 0204 per detection , and appears to be dominated by the proper motions of nearby stars and the difficulty of unambiguously centroiding extended objects like stellar blends and galaxies .",
    "our positional system as a whole should therefore be the same as the usno system with an accuracy @xmath25 04@xmath2601 , but we can provide no independent estimate of the absolute accuracy of the usno system itself .",
    "the precision of the position of any one star relative to the others in our catalog is probably never better than a few @xmath2701 , and will be much worse than this for faint or crowded stars , and for non - stellar detections .",
    "profile - fitting and concentric - aperture photometry were obtained for all images of science targets with the daophot - allstar - allframe - daogrow-@xmath28 software packages following commonly understood reduction procedures ( , stetson 1987 , 1990 , 1994 ) .",
    "the corpus of ground - based instrumental magnitudes measured in the various _ bvri _ systems was then transformed to stetson s current best approximation of landolt s ( 1992 ) _ bvri _ system via the ccdstd - ccdave - newtrial ( stetson 1993 ) software packages .",
    "the way in which the instrumental magnitudes from the various observing runs are transformed to a common standard system duplicating that of landolt as closely as possible has been discussed in some detail recently ( stetson 2005 ) .    in brief",
    ", for each _ photometric _ night , observations of large numbers of primary and secondary standards are used to determine the photometric zero points , extinction coefficients , and polynomial - approximation color - transformation coefficients relating instrumental to standard magnitudes for that specific telescope / filter / detector combination .",
    "these quantitative transforming relationships are used to convert the instrumental magnitudes for hand - selected stars in the  field to the standard system . the totality of calibrated data for each of these stars from all photometric nights is robustly averaged to define a local sequence of secondary standards in the  field itself .    for a _ non - photometric _ data set ,",
    "the data for all celestial fields that contain at least two standard stars spanning some range of color are used to determine the corrections for bandpass - mismatch as functions of the standard color ; during this analysis the photometric zero point of each individual ccd image is allowed to float . in calibrating an individual image of from a non - photometric data set ,",
    "the color transformation derived from all standard - star observations included in that data set is imposed , but the photometric zero point of each image is determined only from the _ local _ secondary standards contained within that image itself .    in the field of",
    ", the first author has identified 712 stars that appear to be both bright and isolated enough to be potentially useful as photometric standard stars . among these ,",
    "412 stars have been sufficiently well observed that they are listed on his web site ( as of january 2005 ) as potential secondary standards for the calibration of other science targets : these are defined as those stars having at least five observations on photometric nights _ and _ standard errors of the mean calibrated magnitude @xmath29mag in at least two of the _ bvri _ filters , and no indication of intrinsic variability greater than 0.05@xmath7mag , root - mean - square , when data from all filters are considered together . for our present purposes , we will use the local reference stars solely to redetermine the photometric zero points of the individual ccd images to place them all on as internally consistent a system as possible .",
    "all other color terms , extinction coefficients , and spatially dependent corrections will be imposed as known quantities from previous calibration stages .",
    "since the zero point of any given ccd image is now the only unknown quantity , for our present purposes we have slightly relaxed the aforementioned criteria and adopted a local reference sequence consisting of 531 stars that were observed on at least three photometric occasions and have standard errors of the mean magnitude @xmath30mag in at least two of the four principal filters , and have no evidence of variability in excess of 0.05@xmath7mag , root - mean - square .",
    "the minimum , median , and maximum number of these local reference stars in any individual ccd image were , respectively , 1 , 159 , and 479 .",
    "our experience is that the aggregate of ccd data for any given astronomical field obtained on any given photometric night can typically be calibrated to the standard magnitude system with an external accuracy @xmath120.02@xmath7mag , root - mean - square ( this is a _ very _ crude generalization ) .",
    "some vague sense of the likely external accuracy of our photometry can therefore be obtained from the data in table  1 .",
    "for instance , at least some data in the @xmath1 band were obtained for the  field on 18 photometric nights , so the absolute @xmath1 magnitude scale has probably been established with an accuracy no better than @xmath31mag .",
    "a pessimist might say that the 0.02@xmath7mag figure actually applies to the accuracy possible from a given _ run _ , rather than _",
    "night_. in this case , the external accuracy would be guesstimated at @xmath32mag . in either case",
    ", the absolute accuracy in @xmath0 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 would be even poorer than these estimates , since these filters were less commonly used than @xmath1 .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes for stars in the wfpc2 observations of were extracted from the images in pretty much the same way as was done for the ground - based data ( see , , stetson  1998 for more details ) . that done , the wfpc2 star lists were searched for cases of individual bright stars that , while not being saturated , nevertheless sufficiently dominated their fainter neighbors that one might be able to relate their wfpc2 instrumental magnitudes to their magnitudes on the fundamental landolt ( 1992 ) photometric system via the ground - based observations of the cluster .",
    "table  2 and table  3 , respectively , list the positions and photometric results for the 91 stars hand - selected for this purpose .    in calibrating these data to the ground - based photometric system",
    ", we found that the color - transformation coefficients of holtzman  ( 1995 ) for the @xmath1 filter were satisfactory : @xmath33 left no serious residual trends with color or magnitude , as we illustrate in fig .  2 .",
    "however , holtzman s @xmath0 transformation , @xmath34 did not seem to work for the  data .",
    "when we imposed this color transformation on the data from the four wfpc2 chips and solved only for a photometric zero point for each image , we obtained the transformation residuals shown in fig .",
    "3 . not only",
    "is there a systematic curvature of the fitting residuals with color , but since the bluest stars all have similar apparent magnitudes  they are on the blue horizontal branch  the poor color transformation appears as a magnitude nonlinearity as well .",
    "we therefore used these data to redetermine the color transformations for the @xmath0 filter , and arrived at the following relationship : @xmath35 this represents the weighted average of the transformations derived independently from the four ccds , and this average transformation was imposed equally on the data from the four chips in the final reduction .",
    "the star - by - star residuals from this best fit are illustrated in fig .",
    "the data shown in the lower panel suggest that a cubic color term might be called for , as the bluest stars still tend to have positive fitting residuals , and the two reddest stars  which have very small uncertainties  have negative residuals . however , in view of the number and quality of the calibrating stars , we judge a cubic transformation to be too extreme to be attempted in this case .",
    "the formal uncertainties of the linear and quadratic coefficients are already @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "our @xmath0-band color - transformation coefficients are painfully huge , and very different from the published values .",
    "we note that in a previous analysis of these same data by piotto  ( 2002 ) , the holtzman color corrections were adopted .",
    "some indications of a problem with the standard f439w calibration were noted by bedin  ( 2000 ) in their study of = c0911 - 646 , which they dealt with by means of an empirical _ linear _ adjustment of the wfpc2-based  colors to ground - based values for stars in the cluster field .",
    "we can offer no explanation for the difference between holtzman s calibration and ours , and fall back on the feeble justification that this transformation appears to be necessary to make our analysis of the wfpc2 images accord with our ground - based results .",
    "the left panel of fig .  5 is a ground - based @xmath1 versus color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for every detection in the field of for which we have photometry in at least the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath17 filters , and @xmath38mag , within the indicated magnitude and color limits .",
    "the right panel plots the value of @xmath39 for the same detections against the visual magnitude .",
    "note that the horizontal scales of the two parts of this diagram are not the same .",
    "solid squares in this plot represent average photometric indices for the 15 previously identified variable candidates in the cluster field , plus one additional variable candidate that we have identified in these data .",
    "the variable candidate at @xmath40 is v18 , discovered by af04 , which they tentatively identify as a foreground rr lyrae star . for those variable candidates for which we were able to estimate periods and produce reasonable light curves ( see next section ) ,",
    "we have derived mean magnitudes by converting the fitted light curves to flux units , integrating over one cycle , and converting the results back to a magnitude scale . in the case of v18for which we were unable to find a period  the mean photometric indices are only robust averages of the individual magnitudes we have in hand .",
    "there will be more discussion of these stars in  5 below .",
    "the cmd clearly shows the presence of foreground stars and background galaxies , especially those with red colors and faint magnitudes .",
    "the presence of stellar blends in the crowded cluster center is also evident in the broad lump of stars above the subgiant branch .",
    "the fact that @xmath39 tends to values larger than 0.1@xmath7mag primarily for stars considerably fainter than @xmath41 suggests that our photometry is reasonably complete to at least this limit implies , in the worst case , @xmath42 , or a signal - to - noise ratio of about 5 in each filter ; if the s / n ratio is slightly poorer than this in one filter , then it will be much better than this in the other .",
    "therefore a star with @xmath43 is at least a @xmath44 detection in @xmath0 and @xmath17 considered together , and is probably a @xmath45 detection when the @xmath1 filter is added , since that bandpass is close to the peak quantum efficiency of standard ccds . ] , which is close to the main - sequence turnoff ( to ) of the cluster .",
    "we therefore estimated the astrometric position of the cluster center as follows : a virtual circular aperture of some specified radius was scanned over the catalog of detections with calibrated positions and magnitudes .",
    "this aperture was judged to be centered on the cluster when the median @xmath23- and median @xmath24-position of all objects with @xmath46 contained within the aperture coincided with the center of the aperture itself .",
    "for instance , when a virtual aperture of radius 5  was concentric with the cluster , it contained 938 catalog entries , and the one - dimensional root - mean - square width of the distribution of objects about the centroid was @xmath47 , so the precision of this cluster centroid may be estimated at @xmath48  68/@xmath49  in each direction .",
    "we presume that any residual incompleteness of stars with @xmath50 at small cluster radii will be more or less independent of position angle , so this should not systematically affect our estimate of the cluster centroid position .",
    "repeat experiments with virtual - aperture radii from 9  down to 10produced ratios @xmath51 that continued to decrease monotonically for smaller aperture radii . during these experiments",
    "the derived cluster centroid position drifted over an _",
    "extreme _ range of 29 in right ascension and 24 in declination .",
    "the center of these two ranges corresponds to the position @xmath2100634 , @xmath332334 ( j2000 ) , which is very close to the estimate obtained with a virtual - aperture radius of 60 , enclosing 741 objects with a positional root - mean - square dispersion of 27 .",
    "this estimated position , which we believe to be accurate to @xmath520 in each coordinate , lies about 3  northeast of the value tabulated by harris ( 1996 ) .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "6 shows the radial distances of all stars with @xmath53mag from this adopted cluster centroid position , plotted against their apparent visual magnitudes .",
    "the filled squares mark 15 of the 16 variable - star candidates ( v18 now lies above the upper edge of the diagram ) .",
    "the lower panel shows @xmath1 magnitude against radius for all stars with @xmath54mag .",
    "the rising lower envelopes for @xmath55  result from the increasing effect of crowding for faint stars at small radii . taken together , these plots suggest that serious incompleteness for stars with @xmath56 probably sets in only for radii less than 10 ; the detection limit improves from @xmath57 at 20  radius to @xmath58 at 100 , and remains _ roughly _ constant at that level as far as the remotest corner of the field some 20  from the cluster center .",
    "the slight upturn of the error  magnitude curves at larger radii is due to the fact that the outer parts of the field are contained in fewer ccd images than the cluster center .",
    "our star list is probably close to complete to @xmath59 at all radii down to the cluster center .",
    "the cluster hb , indicated by the variable stars and an overdensity of constant stars near @xmath60 , can be clearly traced out to a radius of 200 , with one probable rr  lyrae variable ( the one discovered here ) lying nearly 5  from the cluster center . in the upper panel there also appears to be a vague edge to the distribution of upper - main - sequence stars with @xmath61 near a radius of 200 .",
    "5 represents every star with reliable _ bvi _ photometry in our sample .",
    "we now want to produce a cleaner cmd in order to better define the morphology of the cluster fiducial sequence .",
    "7 is an attempt to produce a cleaner diagram by plotting only the catalog entries with the following properties : @xmath53mag , and    @xmath62    these selection criteria have been applied only to the putatively constant stars ; all the variable candidates have been plotted as filled squares regardless of position or magnitude .",
    "it is clear from the figure that even these criteria include a few stars of larger photometric uncertainty , especially among stars slightly brighter than the boundaries of our imposed magnitude zones at @xmath63 and @xmath64 ; presumably these stars with larger color errors are concentrated in the innermost parts of their radial zones as well .",
    "this illustrates a known shortcoming of the allframe analysis package : when photometric errors are dominated by _ crowding _ , rather than _ noise _ , allframe systematically underestimates the uncertainties of the derived photometric indices .",
    "this is shown most clearly by the group of stars to the blue of the rgb and below the hb , with @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "these are mostly cluster giants that have been scattered by up to 0.4@xmath7mag in  color by crowding errors , despite the fact that their @xmath39 color uncertainties have been estimated to be less than 0.10@xmath7mag .",
    "this tendency of the software results from the fact that those photometric uncertainties are estimated from the known readout noise and poissonian photon statistics in the digital image as well as the size of the individual - pixel residuals from the profile fits .",
    "however , when a given blob of light is being modeled by many overlapping profiles each of which has an amplitude and a centroid in two dimensions that may be freely adjusted , many different combinations of fitted parameter values may produce fits of nearly the same quality . as a result , the adopted solutions may in fact be rather farther from the `` true '' solution than the fitting residuals would seem to imply .",
    "the stars here are affected most strongly in the @xmath0 filter because at shorter wavelengths the brightness contrast between the giant - branch stars and the fainter , bluer subgiants and turnoff stars is smaller than in @xmath1 or @xmath17 , which makes the crowding effects more severe .    to reduce the influence of stars whose photometric errors",
    "have been underestimated due to crowding , one can employ a separation index such as that defined by stetson  ( 2003 ; see their sec .",
    "4.1 ) to supplement the @xmath67-based selection criterion .",
    "fig .  8 here results from the same selection criteria as fig .  7 augmented by @xmath68 for an assumed seeing of 10 , which means that a star must be at least sixteen times brighter than the summed contribution of all other stellar profiles at its position , its light must be contaminated by no more than 6% by known companions  when the seeing is one arcsecond .",
    "as one can see , this additional acceptance criterion completely removes the slight haze of stars below the nominal position of the red horizontal branch , and reduces the number of stars above the main - sequence turnoff and subgiant branch .    in table  4",
    "we present our derived fiducial sequences for .",
    "the principal sequences were derived from hand - sketched curves drawn on large - scale plots of cleaned cmds with @xmath1 plotted against , separately , , , , and . once normal points had been read out with a ruler , we considered the first and second differences between the tabulated points , and made minor adjustments to the normal points to produce reasonable smoothness .",
    "the final curves were visually verified by digitally overplotting the final normal points on the cmds . in the case of the horizontal branch , we estimated the locus from a large - scale plot of the @xmath69 cmd ( fig .",
    "9 ) , because this diagram offers the most favorable ratio of photometric uncertainty to color range .",
    "the hand - drawn curve skirts the lower envelope of the horizontal branch where it is nearly flat  and therefore is expected to represent the zahb  and continues through the greatest density of points where it bends faintward at the blue end .",

    "here we have made no selection on radius or crowding ; every point is plotted provided only that @xmath71mag , and the derived color and magnitude fall within the limits of the diagram .",
    "the rr lyrae candidates that fell within the wfpc2 field have again been plotted as filled squares , but since all the  images were obtained within an interval of about 20 minutes , these represent instantaneous photometric quantities , and the estimated photometric errors do not stand out from those of the other stars . the same fiducial sequences as in fig .",
    "11 are reproduced here ; they indicate that our calibration has done a reasonable job of referring the instrumental f439w and f555w magnitudes to the standard _",

    "only the bluest horizontal - branch stars appear to have been measured a bit too red , and the reddest giants have been measured a bit too blue .",
    "this may be a reflection of the third - order color calibration that we eschewed in the previous section .      a comparison of figs .",
    "11 and 12 suggests that a population of blue stragglers  stars brighter than the to and bluer than the lower giant branch  is much more prominent in the wfpc2 data than in the ground - based data . to investigate whether there is a significant reality behind this appearance",
    ", we have estimated the relative frequency of stars in the blue straggler region of the cmd in various subsamples of the data .",

    "the farthest corner of the wfc field lies some 90  from the cluster center .",
    "the ground - based coverage of the cluster , of course becomes confused and imprecise as the center is approached ( fig .",
    "6 above ) .",
    "furthermore , the photometric boxes we will use here are comparatively crude , so we will not be measuring a specific blue - straggler frequency in the sense of bolte ( 1993 ) , for instance .",
    "we define a blue - straggler box in the cmd by the limits @xmath76 and @xmath77 ; similarly we define a lower giant - branch box by @xmath78 and @xmath77 (  figs .  11 and 12 ) .",

    "our past experience is that the detection completeness is not worse than 90% when the photometry achieves these levels of precision . especially with the broad wavelength difference between the @xmath0 and @xmath17 filters enhancing the detectability of , respectively , blue and red stars",

    "we have attempted to compensate by plotting only the stars with the very best data : @xmath89mag , but this has not reduced the scatter .",
    "there are a number of possible explanations .",

    ". however , the perceived scatter does not decrease for the brighter stars as rapidly as one would expect .",
    "second , our 30@xmath1430  field includes the cluster center , while the 4@xmath144  field of mandushev  was some 7  (=  2.4 core radii ) from the center .",

    "third , we believe it is possible that m55 is subject to differential reddening ; its galactic coordinates are @xmath909 , @xmath91 , and the aforementioned plots of color residual versus position suggest that the reddening e ( ) may be increasing toward the east .",

    "the extent of the color difference between a cluster s main - sequence turnoff and its lower giant branch is affected by both age and abundance , with a smaller difference indicating either a greater age or a lower metallicity . by this measure m@xmath755",
    "is then either older or more metal - poor , since for this assumed difference in the clusters reddening values its main sequence is redder and its giant branch is bluer than in .",

    "as discussed above , this age indicator is very nearly the same in the two clusters ; if anything , in fig .",
    "15 m@xmath755 s subgiant branch is skewed slightly to the blue / bright side of that of , and the stars on the sloping part of m@xmath755 s hb are skewed to the red / faint side of s .",

    "* v16 : * our data in the @xmath0 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 filters phase reasonably well for a period near that found by af04 , but the data in the @xmath1 filter do not . by experimenting",
    ", we found that by considering only the data taken before hjd 2,450,000 ( october 9 , 1995 ) , we were able to get reasonable light curves in all filters for a period of 0.372@xmath725@xmath7d , which is close to our overall best period .",
    "conversely , for the data taken since then , including the af04 data , the best period is 0.372@xmath788@xmath7d , with a small amount of enhanced scatter in the @xmath1-band light curve .",
    "* v17 : * like the case with v11 and v16 , in @xmath0 and @xmath16 our data phase well with af04 s for a period very near their derived value , but a small percentage of the @xmath1 data are out of phase .",
    "( the @xmath17-band data for this star are comparatively poor , but they appear to dislike this period , too . ) here , the optimum slice point seemed to be near hjd 2,451,000 ( july 5 , 1998 ) . for the data from earlier than that date ,",
    "quite nice light curves were obtained for a period of 0.371@xmath7222@xmath7d ; the later data , which are dominated by af04 , indicate a best period of 0.374@xmath7944@xmath7d with amplitude variations .",
    "there is also a slightly more complicated scenario .",
    "( 1 )  if we take _ our _ data from before hjd 2,450,000 , they can be reasonably well fit with a period of 0.374@xmath78@xmath7d .",
    "a period of 0.371@xmath72@xmath7d is not as good .",
    "( 2 )  in the data taken between 2,450,000 and 2,450,999 there are a number of reasonable periods : one of them is around 0.374@xmath78@xmath7d and , again , 0.371@xmath72@xmath7d is not as good . ( 3 )  but if we try to phase these two groups together , there is no single period that works well . ( 4 )  if we try to phase all our data from after 2,450,000 , but not the af04 data , the comparatively few points obtained after 2,451,000 could not be well phased with those obtained earlier at any period .",
    "conclusion : it seems that each major group ( the mannino data , the newburn data , our pre-2,450,000 data , our 2,450,000 - 999 data , the af04 data ) , taken by itself , can be well fit with a period in the range 0.374@xmath78@xmath7d to 0.374@xmath79@xmath7d .",
    "it is only when we seek to combine the data sets over a long time interval that a 0.371@xmath72@xmath7d period appears .",
    "this suggests that we have some sort of phase jumps or short - lived period changes that we do not record well , but that the main period does not really change very much .",
    "* v18 : * candidate variable v18 was identified by af04 and was thought by them to be a likely foreground rr  lyrae variable projected onto the cluster core .",
    "we used our software to examine our data for any plausible periodicities in the range 0.20@xmath7d to 0.80@xmath7d .",
    "25 presents the light curve corresponding to the most plausible periodic variation found , with a period of 0.324@xmath151d . in presenting this figure ,",
    "we have resisted the temptation to edit out by hand those magnitude measurements that are obviously discrepant . as the cmds of the previous section have shown , this star is by a significant margin the brightest one in the direction of the main body of the cluster .",
    "it is very likely that this star is near or above the saturation level of the detector in some of the long - exposure images , especially for the longer - wavelength filters .",
    "it may also have fallen near the edge of the ccd or on a cosmetic blemish in some of the exposures .",
    "the star is close to the center of the cluster , and our reconstruction of the scene splits the image of v18 into three components , with companions separated by 02 and 09 from the primary star",
    ". the reality of the second and third components of the blend may reasonably be doubted , but their presence and astrometric positions  inferred from the best - seeing images available  have been uniformly assumed in poorer - seeing images as well .",
    "differing seeing conditions can quite easily lead to the attribution of different fractions of the photons to different components of the optical blend in different images . in any long list of automatically derived photometry",
    "there will always be some corrupt measurements .",
    "however , our robust software has been designed to reduce the weight of grossly discrepant data points unless it can find some way to phase them up into the reasonable semblance of a light curve . a periodicity search extended out to a possible period as large as 1000@xmath7d turned up a statistically slightly more significant periodicity of 32.99@xmath7d for v18 , but that light curve was no more visually satisfying than fig .  25 .",
    "our conclusion is that the star may or may not be be varying ( we suspect it is nt ) , but we certainly can not infer the physical nature of any intrinsic variation from the data in hand .    * v19 : * this star was not previously recognized as a variable candidate , so it has no previous time - resolved photometry in the literature .",
    "the light curve fit to our data is noisy , and can be slightly improved if we assume two periodicities rather than one or , alternatively , a change of period or discontinuous jump in phase during the time span covered by our observations .",
    "the available data do not permit a definitive conclusion , and the period that we have tabulated seems to be a reasonable compromise .",
    "it is probably noteworthy that the four most anomalous variables , v11 , v13 , v16 , and v17 , have best periods of 0.39 , 0.41 , 0.37 , and 0.37@xmath7d , respectively .",
    "these relatively long rrc periods suggest that the erratic phasing may have something to do with a blending of the fundamental and first overtone pulsation modes .",
    "however , although the fits to the light curves of these stars might be marginally improved by double - mode solutions , in no case do we see conclusive evidence for genuine double - mode behavior .",
    "comparison of the older and modern periods for the rr  lyrae variables ( table  8) indicates that some of the variables have undergone real period changes over the past half century . neglecting v17 , for which the long - term period behavior is perhaps uncertain , the mean period change for the thirteen remaining variables is + 0.5 days per million years .",
    "this is a large average period change compared to theoretical expectations ( catelan 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "however , rr  lyrae stars are known to exhibit  noisy \" period changes as well as the longer - term period changes expected from evolution ( , rathbun & smith 1997 ) .",
    "it is likely that observations spanning half a century do not yet reveal the true evolutionary period changes of the rr  lyrae stars .",
    "the revised number of rr  lyrae stars in also leads to a revision of its specific rr  lyrae fraction , defined as @xmath152 , where @xmath153 ( harris 1996 ) is the cluster s integrated absolute magnitude in @xmath1 . with @xmath154 ,",
    "we find @xmath155 , compared to 30.8 in the current version of the harris catalog . with this result , now has one of the highest @xmath156 values known , falling behind only six other galactic globular clusters .    in fig .",
    "26 we show a histogram of the rr  lyrae pulsation periods in .",
    "the rrc periods were `` fundamentalized '' by adding 0.128 to their @xmath157 values . as can be clearly seen",
    ", there is a sharp peak in the period distribution at a period around @xmath158  d. such a peaked period distribution is not uncommon among galactic globular clusters , as discussed by rood & crocker ( 1989 ) and catelan ( 2004a ) .",
    "the origin of this phenomenon is unclear at present , but it does suggest that the full width of the instability strip is not uniformly populated .",

    "it is possible that the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) point source catalog can help us with this question .",
    "we have searched in that catalog for detections near our measured positions for the variable candidates and the constant stars near the instability strip .",

    "obviously , the @xmath1 and @xmath17 magnitudes have been taken from our work , and the _ jhk _ magnitudes from the 2mass point source catalog .",
    "the uncertainties of the 2mass magnitudes are large , and not all of our stars have 2mass counterparts ; evidently these objects are very near the 2mass detection limit , and in fact the actual errors of the infrared measurements may be larger than indicated due to the patchy underlying cluster light .",

    "apart from this one star , all the other objects in the diagram are supposed to be in or near the instability strip , much bluer than v18 .",
    "therefore , assuming that our cross - identification of _ this _ object is correct , then it would be unreasonable to expect that any of the other stars should be redder than it _",
    "if _ the provisional cross - identification between the optical object and the infrared catalog entry is also correct . on this basis , we can probably say with confidence that the two provisional cross - identifications where the optical and infrared positions differ by more then 12 are both incorrect , since their inferred  colors are redder than that of v18 .",
    "these are variable candidate v11 and possible constant star c2 ; the 2mass indices probably do not refer to these objects , and can not tell us anything new about them .",
    "the infrared sources are sufficiently distant from the optical detections that even blending between them is probably not a serious issue .    among the stars",
    "whose positions agree to less than 12 , we have labeled four : the putatively stable stars c1 , c7 , and v15 ( empty circles ) and the rrab star v7 ( filled square ) . clearly the inferred color for v7 is anomalous . in reversing the search , , in looking for optically detected objects near 2mass sources rather than looking for 2mass sources near our variable stars , we did find that v7 is in fact the brightest , closest optical object near the infrared detection .",

    "there are 26 other objects with @xmath196 in the wfpc2 detection catalog ; the closest and brightest of these ( defined as the one that produces the most severe contamination in one - arcsecond seeing conditions ) is a subgiant / turnoff star with @xmath197 and @xmath198 . in terms of the fraction of photons delivered to the position of v7 s centroid on the sky in one - arcsecond seeing ,",
    "this companion is fainter than v7 by 3.2@xmath7mag in the @xmath1 photometric bandpass ; correspondingly , it would contaminate v7 at a 5%  level in @xmath1 if its contribution were unrecognized .",
    "the other companions would each contaminate v7 at a level of less than 1.6% each .",
    "even if all 26 of the companions were added together , and even allowing for the fact that they are probably all cooler than v7 and , hence , not so faint  relatively speaking  in the infrared bandpasses , it is not clear that the superposition of these stars with v7 could produce the @xmath199-band magnitude of the 2mass detection .",
    "the 2mass source likely represents , rather , the integrated photometry of an ensemble of stars considerably larger than 4  in diameter surrounding the position of v7 . at this point",

    "the remaining entries in table  15 are plausible cross - identifications on both astrometric and photometric grounds . encouraged by this comparison that these remaining stars have been well photometered , we are able to place quantitative constraints on the colors of the blue and red edges of the instability strip . no constant star has been shown to lie definitively within the instability strip on the basis of both optical _ and _ infrared colors , although some stars  c1 and c7 , for instance  are very near or in the instability strip in optical _ or _ infrared colors but not both .",
    "these conclusions are weaker than might otherwise be the case , due to the low mass and relative remoteness of : its horizontal - branch magnitude appears to lie very near the 2mass detection limit , the total number of horizontal - branch stars is small , and confusion is an issue for many of them because the angular extent of the cluster is also small .",

    "as discussed by contreras  ( 2005 ) , such a classification seems inconsistent with the current theoretical paradigm , which holds that rr  lyrae stars in oo  i globular clusters ( comparatively metal - rich systems with predominantly red or intermediate hbs and @xmath203d ) are relatively unevolved objects , whereas those in oo  ii globulars ( metal - poor clusters with predominantly blue hbs and @xmath204d ) are evolved from a position on the blue zahb ( , lee  1990 ; clement & shelton 1999 ) .",
    "however , when this potential conflict with the evolutionary interpretation was identified , the possibility was raised that at least some of the rr  lyrae periods reported in the literature for  were in fact incorrect ( clement 2000 ) . while catelan ( 2005 ) has shown that the oosterhoff dichotomy  as defined by the mean period of the rrab variables  is present even among galactic globular clusters with @xmath205 , it is important to check the position of the variables in the bailey ( period - amplitude ) diagram to place firmer constraints on the oosterhoff status of a cluster or galaxy ( catelan 2004b and references therein ) .",

    "however , the _ ab_-type variables of clearly lie closer to the oo  i relations despite the cluster s comparatively low metal abundance and predominantly blue horizontal branch .    the present analysis and that of af04 have confirmed the observation of clement ( 2000 ) that many of newburn s ( 1957 ) periods were uncertain and probably incorrect ;",
    "in fact , essentially _ all _ the periods that newburn flagged as uncertain have turned out to be seriously imprecise or wrong . however , despite these necessary revisions the oo  i classification of the cluster stands as a firm result .",
    "our analysis gives a @xmath207  d for the five confirmed rrab variables , and @xmath208  d for the ten rrc ( including the candidate rre s ) .",
    "these values are both clearly consistent with an oo  i classification , and incompatible with an oo  ii type .",
    "we note again that our analysis of the morphology of the evolved sequences in the cmd of suggests that its metal abundance may be somewhat higher than previously thought : higher than the abundance of m@xmath755 and thus intermediate between that cluster ( oo  ii ) and m@xmath73 ( oo  i ) . the observed color of the main sequence in leads to a similar conclusion _ provided _ we accept that the interstellar reddening toward m@xmath755 is considerably higher than the value listed in harris s compilation catalog , but very close to the value given by the schlegel  reddening maps .",
    "the properties tentatively inferred from the fourier decomposition of the rr lyrae light curves of also suggest a greater similarity to the variables of m@xmath73 than to those of m@xmath755 .",
    "an intriguing aspect related to the oo  i status of the cluster is its very large rrc number fraction , @xmath209 , which stands in sharp contrast with the much smaller values ( @xmath210 ) typically found in oo  i globular clusters with intermediate or predominantly red hb types .",
    "in fact , the rrc number fraction seems to fall much more in line with the predominantly blue hb of the cluster .",
    "the same combination of predominantly blue hb morphology , large rrc number fraction and oo  i status has recently also been confirmed for the galactic globular cluster m62 ( = c1658300 ) by contreras et al .",
    "we therefore favor the interpretation that is intermediate in metallicity between m@xmath73 and m@xmath755 , and close to whatever conceptual boundary it is that separates oo  i clusters from oo  ii ; it is predominantly on the oo  i side of that boundary , but with some extreme properties compared to other oo  i clusters , such as its comparatively low metallicity , mainly blue horizontal branch , and high fraction of rrc - type variables .",
    "ngc@xmath74147 has recently surfaced from a long period of relative oblivion to a renewed interest , due to its claimed association with the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) satellite of the milky way , which appears to be merging with the main body of the galaxy and supplying the latter with its stars and globular clusters ( bellazzini  2003a , 2003b , and references therein ) .",
    "the present detailed analysis of the color - magnitude diagram and variable - star properties of the cluster may help us understand its place within the framework of formation models of the galactic halo .",

    "in contrast with previous photometric studies of the cluster , we have been able to examine a wide field that has provided an essentially complete assessment of the cluster s hb . furthermore , we have also been able to reach about 2.5  mag below the to point , thus being able to establish  for the first time  a secure age for  relative to other , better - studied globular clusters .",
    "our results indicate that , compared to similar objects in the studies of rosenberg  ( 1999 ) and vandenberg ( 2000 ) ,  has a completely normal age .",
    "( in the course of this exposition , we have noted that the @xmath217 value adopted by vandenberg from previous studies of m@xmath755 is probably overestimated by @xmath218mag . )",
    "if the cluster is indeed associated with the sagittarius dsph , this suggests that the latter was able to form globular clusters over an extended period of time , since at least for palomar  12 , which people have also associated with the sagittarius dwarf ( da costa & armandroff 1995 ; dinescu  2000 ) , there appears to be a consensus regarding its relative youth ( gratton & ortolani 1988 ; stetson 1989 ; chaboyer  1996 ; rosenberg et al . 1999 ; vandenberg 2000 ; salaris & weiss 2002 ) .",
    "while the variation in mean globular cluster age with metallicity remains somewhat debatable , it seems fairly certain that pal  12 is at least 25%33% younger than .    as concerns the rr  lyrae variable stars , together with af04",
    "we have been able to correct the problematic period values to which clement ( 2000 ) called attention , thus confirming  on the basis of the average ab- and c - type periods , as well as the bailey ( period - amplitude ) diagram for the rrabs  castellani & quarta s ( 1987 ) classification of the cluster as type oo  i. unlike what is typically found in oo  i clusters , has a predominantly blue hb .",
    "interestingly , the c - to - ab number ratio is more in line with the cluster s blue hb type than it is with its oo  i classification .",
    "this all suggests that the stars in the instability strip are relatively unevolved from the zahb , but concentrated toward the blue side , unlike traditional oo  i clusters where the variables are near the zahb but uniformly distributed or concentrated to the red side of the instability strip , and also unlike traditional oo  ii clusters , where the zahb is populated primarily to the blueward of the instability strip , and many stars do not become pulsationally unstable until after considerable luminosity and temperature evolution .",
    "a similar phenomenon has been recently seen in the case of m62 ( contreras 2005 ) .",
    "for a critical discussion of the role played by evolutionary effects in producing oo  ii clusters , the reader is referred to pritzl et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and a discussion of appropriate nomenclature is to be found in catelan ( 2004a ; last paragraph on his p.  411 ) .",
    "other sagittarius - related globulars have been studied by salinas  ( 2005 ) and cacciari  ( 2002 ) ; the combined results suggest that those globular clusters that have been notionally associated with the sagittarius dwarf galaxy have fairly unusual rr  lyrae pulsation characteristics when compared with the remainder of the galactic globular cluster system .",
    "this suggests ( see also catelan 2004b , 2005 ) that the sagittarius merger is not truly representative of the typical process that has led to the formation of the present - day galactic halo : the latter s oldest stellar populations would have looked quite different if sagittarius - like protogalactic fragments were primarily responsible for its assembly .",

    "<S> new _ bvri _ broad - band photometry and astrometry are presented for the globular cluster , based upon measurements derived from 524 ground - based ccd images mostly either donated by colleagues or retrieved from public archives . </S>",
    "<S> we have also reanalysed five exposures of the cluster obtained with wfpc2 on the _ hubble space telescope _ in the f439w and f555w ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) filters . </S>",
    "<S> we present calibrated color - magnitude and color - color diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the color - magnitude diagram reveals morphogical properties generally consistent with published metal - abundance estimates for the cluster , and an age typical of other galactic globular clusters of similar metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> we have also redetermined the periods and mean magnitudes for the rr lyrae variables , including a new c - type variable reported here for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> our data do not show clear evidence for photometric variability in candidate v18 , recently reported by arellano  ferro  ( 2004 rmxaa 40 , 209 ) . </S>",

    "<S> the mean periods and the bailey period - amplitude diagrams support the classification of the cluster as oosterhoff  i despite its predominantly blue horizontal branch . the number ratio of c- to ab - type rr  lyrae stars , on the other hand , is unusually high for an oosterhoff  i cluster .    </S>",
