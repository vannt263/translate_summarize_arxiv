    "there is compelling evidence that baryonic matter in the presence of einstein gravity does not suffice to describe the universe we live in .",
    "the most natural and popular suggestion is that we are surrounded by a sea of massive , non - relativistic particles .",
    "dubbed cold dark matter ( cdm ) , it can account for the dynamics of galaxies and clusters and the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "furthermore it can arise in a plethora of extensions to the standard model of particle physics and would currently exist as a thermal relic from hot era at early times @xcite .",
    "alternatives to the cdm scenario have been proposed . at the more extreme level , it has been suggested that einstein gravity is modified , either through higher order corrections to the einstein - hilbert action , or through the addition of new gravitational degrees of freedom that affect the relationship between the geometric and physical nature of the space - time metric @xcite .",
    "the less radical proposals typically involve replacing the cold dark matter by some non - particulate degree of freedom such as a scalar field or a fluid which has an effectively pressureless equation of state . within this class of models ,",
    "there have been attempts at resolving _ both _ the dark matter problem and the dark energy problem .",
    "a notable example is that of chaplygin gas @xcite .",
    "a proposal has been put forward in @xcite from a different approach . a theory for degenerate metrics is lacking and it was suggested that the solution would be the introduction of additional dynamical degrees of freedom for the space - time connection @xcite .",
    "a candidate action , the eddington - born - infeld action ( ebi ) for these degrees of freedom was proposed in @xcite and it was shown that they had unexpected effects : they could mimic the presence of dark energy and dark matter in the expansion of the universe and could modify the newton - poisson equation , leading to flat rotation curves for galaxies .",
    "hence it was proposed that the ebi action was a candidate for non - particulate dark matter and dark - energy .",
    "the eddington action @xcite has also been considered in the context of dark energy@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we wish to study the effect of ebi degrees of freedom on the expansion of the universe and on the growth of structure of the universe . in doing so",
    ", we will identify the different regimes in the expansion rate and how they depend on the parameters in the action and we will calculate the effect on the density perturbations and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "we will focus on two possible uses for the ebi theory , one in which the extra degrees of freedom unify the dark sector , as proposed in @xcite and another in which they co - exist with a cosmological constant , playing the role of dark matter . as a result",
    "we can identify a viable theory of dark matter which is competitive with the standard cdm paradigm .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the section [ action ] we display the ebi action and equations of motion and rewrite them as a specific case of _ bigravity _ or , alternatively , as a particular _ bimetric _ theory , as recently shown in @xcite",
    "; in section [ cosmos ] we study the dynamics of homogeneous and isotropic solutions to the equations of motion ( see  @xcite for homogeneous but anisotropic solutions ) ; in section [ perturbations ] we study the growth of linear perturbations and in section [ lss ] we calculate the power spectrum of density perturbations and anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background , allowing us to make a cursory comparison with current data ; finally in section [ discussion ] we discuss our findings .",

    "a number of examples of bigravity theories have been studied in detail  @xcite , in particular in terms of their consistency , asymptotic behavior and the global dynamics of isotropic and homogeneous space times .",
    "it should be remarked that in the context of bigravity theories , ebi turns out to be the simplest theory with a minimal interaction between both sectors . in this paper",
    "we study in detail the cosmological dynamics both of the background and at the perturbative level and hence extract useful hints of what one might expect from more general classes of bigravity theories .",

    "if one looks at the action as it is presented in equation [ bigravity ] , i.e. a theory of two metrics , one of them , @xmath5 , quite clearly couples to the matter fields and has physical significance- it is this metric that defines how clocks and rulers respond- and hence we can call it a  physical \" metric .",
    "the other metric , @xmath12 satisfies the einstein - hilbert action and couples to the rest of the world through it s interaction with the physical metric .",

    "this is entirely akin to the approach in the tensor - scalar - vector theory of gravity @xcite and can give us an intriguing interpretation of roles of the different fields .",
    "the field equations which are found from either the original ebi or the bigravity ( or bimetric ) action are the einstein equations for @xmath5 @xmath21 and the einstein equations for @xmath12 @xmath22      \\label{curv_ebi_eq}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the einstein tensor of @xmath12 .",

    "is that when @xmath54 , the equation of state @xmath43 will evolve slowly and the ebi field will behave as cold dark matter .",
    "this is independent of whether the ebi field is dominating the background dynamics or not , and is therefore valid throughout the entire history of the universe ( e.g. during radiation , matter and possible cosmological constant eras ) provided @xmath55 is small . in this case @xmath56 where @xmath57 is an initial condition .",
    "since @xmath43 is proportional to @xmath58 , the cold dark matter behaviour is unstable , and is bound to end when @xmath43 is sufficiently driven away from zero and becomes @xmath59 . at this point ,",
    "the subsequent behaviour of the ebi field , depends on various factors which we analyse below on a case by case basis .",
    "let us first consider the case where @xmath60 i.e the ebi field is driving the background dynamics .",
    "apart from the dark matter behaviour ( @xmath61 ) which as we have discussed above can always be realized , we uncover two more phases .",
    "the first is a constant-@xmath62 phase such that @xmath63 which solves the equation @xmath64 this constant @xmath62 depends only on the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath65 we have that @xmath66 while for @xmath67 we have that @xmath68 .",
    "this means that @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath72 . indeed in this case",
    "phantom behaviour is possible by allowing @xmath73 .    when @xmath74 ( i.e. @xmath69 ) , the above constant-@xmath62 phase is unstable , simply because @xmath75 eventually drops and approaches @xmath76 .",
    "if this happens before the fluid @xmath77 becomes dominant ( which could happen if @xmath77 is a cosmological constant ) , then the constant-@xmath62 phase ends and the ebi fluid now behaves like a cosmological constant , i.e. @xmath78 .",
    "( [ w_e_p ] ) , then gives that this cosmological constant is given by @xmath79    it turns out that this desitter phase is stable under homogeneous time - dependent perturbations ( although not under inhomogeneous perturbations ; see relevant section below ) .",
    "we postpone the stability analysis until case 3 .",
    "an interesting case emerges if @xmath42 is neither negligible nor dominant but rather is assumed to track the fluid .",
    "this is possible provided @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a proportionality constant related to the ebi relative density as @xmath84 .",
    "eq ( [ w_e_p ] ) then tells us that this is possible iff @xmath85 , in which case we get @xmath86 which gives @xmath87 .",
    "since there are no interesting fluids with equation of state @xmath88 ( apart from a cosmological constant , treated below ) , this case is not of much relevance .      in the limit where @xmath90 we find @xmath91 and therefore @xmath92 , which is valid only for @xmath73 .",
    "we can explore this limit further ; if @xmath93 is constant and @xmath76 non - negligible then we have that the ebi density is given by @xmath94 while the effective cosmological constant such that @xmath95 is @xmath96 in the limit in which @xmath97 we recover the previous case .",
    "one should further impose the conditions @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "for @xmath70 , a necessary and sufficient condition for this to hold , is that @xmath100 ( regardless of the sign of @xmath101 ) , while for @xmath73 we need @xmath102 .",
    "this second subcase can not be realized ( see case-5 below ) . for @xmath74 ,",
    "taking the limit @xmath103 takes us back to case-1 .",
    "the negative sign appearing in the expressions above is quite misleading , and one could think that it might be possible to cancel the effective cosmological constant to sufficiently small values .",
    "this is clearly impossible for @xmath104 simply because by virtue of ( [ rho_e ] ) we also have @xmath105 .",
    "it is also impossible for @xmath106 since again because of ( [ rho_e ] ) we need @xmath74 which implies that @xmath107 .",
    "thus we can not have cancellation of the cosmological constant .",
    "we now perform stability analysis ( as mentioned in case-1 ) of this desitter phase ( for which @xmath74 ) .",
    "let @xmath108 and @xmath109 with @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "perturbing ( [ rho_e_p ] ) and ( [ w_e_p ] ) to linear order we find @xmath112 and @xmath113 which combine to give @xmath114 the normal modes are @xmath115 where @xmath116 \\nonumber\\ ] ] therefore the approach to desitter is critically damped for @xmath117 while it is underdamped for @xmath118 and overdamped for @xmath119 . furthermore",
    ", we have that @xmath120 and so the underdamped solutions are always decaying . finally it is possible to have only the overdamped solutions by choosing @xmath121 .",
    "we now pass to the regime where @xmath123 , i.e. the ebi field is subdominant , and the cosmological dynamics are driven by some fluid @xmath77 which is _ not _ a cosmological constant .",
    "consistency requires that @xmath124 ( otherwise this case can not be realized ) , and we therefore get that @xmath125 hence we find that if the ebi - field is subdominant , the above equations lead to two possible behaviours : the ebi fluid behaves either as cold dark matter if @xmath126 , i.e. very close to zero , or as curvature if @xmath127 .",
    "the final case we consider is when @xmath75 is negligible but now @xmath129 , i.e. the background fluid which drives the dynamics is the bare cosmological constant @xmath35 .",
    "here we find a new regime such that @xmath130 in addition to the cold dark matter regime which can still be realized .",
    "note that we recover the curvature like behaviour if @xmath131 while @xmath132 if @xmath133 .",
    "one may wonder whether phantom behaviour such that @xmath134 can be realized in this case , by choosing @xmath2 such that @xmath135 .",
    "this turns out to be impossible : when @xmath101 becomes smaller than the threshold value @xmath136 , this takes us back to case 3 .",
    "decreasing @xmath2 further ( or decreasing @xmath101 ) eventually leads to case 1 .",
    "having analyzed the different possible behaviours of the ebi field in various cases above , we now turn to realistic model building .",
    "we will use units in @xmath137 which is the standard in popular boltzmann solvers such as cmbfast  @xcite , camb  @xcite and cmbeasy  @xcite . in these units",
    "we have that the hubble constant today is @xmath138 , with @xmath139 . for numerics we can absorb @xmath140 into the definition of densities .",

    "turning to the ebi field , we need to set its initial density @xmath146 and initial equation of state parameter @xmath147 at the initial scale factor @xmath148 . to do this we require that the initial condition for @xmath42 is such that it would give rise to an equivalent cdm density in the past . in other words requiring that the equivalent cdm density today would be @xmath149 , with @xmath150 , we extrapolate this to the initial scale factor @xmath148 and set the initial condition for the ebi density as @xmath151 , with @xmath152 .    for setting the initial condition for @xmath43 , we require that the ebi field behaves as cdm all the way up to at least @xmath153 where @xmath43 starts to become @xmath59 . since in the cdm phase @xmath154 , we set the initial condition for @xmath43 as @xmath155 , by specifying a positive parameter @xmath156 .",
    "the background model is thus completely determined by six parameters : the initial conditions @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath156 as well as the two parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 ( for the fixed radiation density discussed above ; massive neutrinos can easily be accommodated in the usual way but we refrain to discuss it here for reasons of simplicity ) . on top of specifying these parameters one has to make sure that the inequality constraint ( [ w_ineq ] ) is obeyed . in the light of setting up initial conditions",
    "as we have just described the inequality becomes @xmath160      the simplest possibility is when the ebi field is chosen to act as cdm all the way , and is not responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe which is due to the bare cosmological constant @xmath35 . in this case , in order for the ebi field not to deviate from the cdm track , we must have that @xmath161 .",
    "moreover the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 do not have any role in the background .",
    "thus we are down to three parameters : @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 , the same as in the standard @xmath35cdm model .",
    "we call this model the @xmath35ebi model .",
    "choosing @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 we have a background evolution identical to the wmap5 best fit @xmath35cdm model .",
    "it is therefore not distinguishable from the @xmath35cdm model using , for example , type-1a supernovae data  @xcite .      by lowering the cosmological constant @xmath165 gradually to zero",
    ", we should start compensating by having the ebi field to play a role in the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "lowering @xmath35 changes the angular diameter distance to the surface of last scatter and hence shifts the position of the acoustic peaks in the cmb .",
    "since the peaks are very tightly constrained , we must change one further parameter to make up for the change induced by varying @xmath35 .",
    "as a 2nd parameter ( for illustration ) we choose to vary @xmath156 .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ equal_dist ] shows the locus curve for which both the angular diameter distance and conformal time today @xmath166 , remain constant , in the @xmath156 and @xmath158 plane .",
    "the point @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "we call this model `` model a '' . the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 are chosen to be @xmath169 and @xmath170 for this model .",
    "increasing @xmath2 or lowering @xmath156 still gives acceptable @xmath35ebi models as the dependence on lowering @xmath156 or increasing @xmath2 is very week and for most cases does not produce any observable result . as we lower @xmath158 towards zero , we keep increasing @xmath156 , along the displayed curve to make sure that the angular diameter distance to recombination stays constant . when @xmath171 exactly , @xmath172 ( this depends on our choice of @xmath157 and @xmath159 ) .",
    "we call this `` model c '' . for clarity",
    "we also consider a `` model b '' for which @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "figure [ fig_rhoe_real_var ] shows the evolution of the ebi energy density ( solid ) , radiation density ( long dash ) , baryons ( dotted ) and cosmological constant ( dash ) for four models along this curve .",
    "the upper left panel is model a , the upper right panel is model b with @xmath173 and @xmath175 , the lower right panel is a model with @xmath176 and @xmath177 , and finally the lower right panel is model c. figure [ fig_xy_real_var ] exhibits the variables @xmath40 ( solid ) , @xmath41 ( dashed ) , @xmath178 ( dotted ) and @xmath179 ( long  dashed ) for the same set of models . observe that during the time for which the ebi field is like cdm , both @xmath40 and @xmath41 are approximately constant ( very slowly varying ) , while during the @xmath180 phase , @xmath40 is still an approximate constant while @xmath41 is varying .",
    "once we reach the point @xmath181 ( model c ) we can start investigating the effect of changing @xmath1 . once again we keep changing @xmath156 in order to compensate and keep the angular diameter distance the same . along this line",
    "we consider two further models : model d has @xmath182 and @xmath183 , while model e has @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "remember that @xmath1 is connected with the constant @xmath43 phace .",
    "in particular model d has @xmath186 during the acceleration era while model e gives rise to phantom behaviour with @xmath187 .",
    "in principle we can further investigate varying @xmath2 .",
    "we find however that changing @xmath2 does not lead to any interesting new behaviour .",
    "if we compensate the variation of @xmath2 with @xmath156 , then @xmath156 must be increased , and this leads to a similar effect as decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "let us also note that the general ebi family of models would give a background evolution that deviates from the @xmath35cdm model .",
    "they can therefore be distinguished from @xmath35cdm using , for example , type-1a supernovae data  @xcite .",
    "however , as we discuss further below , we do not find any parameter space allowed ( apart from the @xmath35ebi special case ) when we consider the cosmic microwave background angular power spectrum observations .",
    "it is therefore of little significance to try to constrain such models with the supernovae data .      in this section",
    "we have mapped out various possibilities for the background evolution . as claimed in @xcite ,",
    "it is possible to construct a theory in which the ebi field plays the dual role of both dark matter and dark energy .",
    "we have generalized the results in @xcite by uncovering a third phase of the ebi field where it has a constant - w equation of state which interpolates between the cdm phase and the cosmological constant phase .",
    "thus the ebi field is a unified model very similar to to chaplygin gas .",
    "we stress however that contrary to the chaplygin gas , @xmath43 is an independent dynamical degree of freedom , and thus the equation of state of ebi is not rigid .",
    "this leads to even richer dynamics in the perturbations as we show in the next section .",
    "we have specified the requirements on the initial conditions of the ebi field as well as the two parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 , in order to have a background evolution that is compatible with the standard paradigm .",
    "this gave us the simple @xmath35ebi model , for which the ebi field replaces cdm but is not responsible for the accelerated expansion which is still due to the cosmological constant @xmath35 . by gradually lowering @xmath35 to zero , and compensating with the ebi field , one can have the initial condition @xmath156 as well as the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 to play a role , leading to the mixed ebi model , where the effective cosmological constant recieves a contribution from @xmath35 and the ebi field . when @xmath188 we get the plain ebi model",
    "as we have seen in previous sections , the ebi background field can behave as pressureless matter and as cosmological constant , and there are transitions between these two phases .    after displaying the equations of motion for linearized fluctuations , in this section",
    "we show via analytical approximations that the matter phase is consistent with current observations . on the contrary ,",
    "fluctuations on the acceleration phase show an unacceptable growth .",
    "finally , we show an analytical series in @xmath189 providing a systematic way to isolate the matter phase , as the zero order approximation , leaving an evolution indistinguishable from @xmath35cdm .",
    "corrections in powers @xmath189 can then be computed to any desired order .",
    "these will be reported elsewhere .",

    "we now show that if @xmath54 and the pressure perturbation @xmath214 and shear @xmath215 are initially chosen to be zero , then they will remain arbitrarily small , and the ebi field will behave as cdm even at the fluctuation level .    during this phase",
    "we get that @xmath219 , hence we can set @xmath220 , @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "the @xmath214 equation then becomes @xmath223\\pi_{\\ensuremath{{e}}}\\ ] ] since it is not sourced by any other variable in this limit , if we set @xmath224 initially , it will stay zero . thus imposing @xmath224 in the shear equation and taking the same limit above we get @xmath225 which has solution @xmath226 .",
    "thus for very small initial relative pressure perturbation and shear , i.e. @xmath227 and @xmath228 , the ebi field will behave exactly as cold dark matter at the perturbative level , i.e. the equations for @xmath212 and @xmath213 would read @xmath229 respectively .",
    "this means that if @xmath230 throughout the entire history of the universe until today ( such as the @xmath35ebi model - a ) , we would expect any observable to be completely indistinguishable between an ebi dark matter model and a standard dark matter model .",
    "note also that we have assumed that @xmath227 and @xmath228 to obtain _ exact _ cdm - like behaviour .",
    "but if we were to include a small amount of pressure perturbation and shear in the initial conditions on very small scales , this might lead to differences with the cdm which might be observable at the cores of galaxies , clusters and in the small scale structure of gravitating bodies .",
    "indeed , differences vis - a - vis cdm are expected to occur once a system enters the non - linear regime where @xmath227 and @xmath228 are inevitably sourced .",
    "the evolution of perturbations during a regime of accelerated expansion is more intriguing .",
    "assume that @xmath231 and neglect baryons and other components .",
    "as shown in @xcite the equations of motion for ebi gravity have an exact de - sitter solution , @xmath232 this field solves equations ( [ h_c ] ) and ( [ y_dot ] ) .",

    ".    we would like to stress that this conclusion may change when introducing extra  fierz - pauli \" couplings to the ebi action .",
    "see @xcite for a recent discussion .",
    "in this paragraph we develop an analytical method to isolate the matter phase for the ebi field .",
    "numerical analysis show that this occur for @xmath2 and @xmath41 large .",
    "we then attempt to use @xmath189 , the coupling between both metrics , as a perturbative parameter .",
    "consider the following frobenious type series for the background functions @xmath242",
    ", @xmath243 we have included a positive power of @xmath2 in @xmath41 for two reasons .",
    "first , recall the ebi background density has the form @xmath244 . thus ,",
    "if @xmath41 scales as @xmath245 , then at order zero in @xmath189 there will be a finite contribution to the friedmann equation from the ebi field , which turns out to be dark matter .",
    "the interesting observation is that this series also provides the right equations for all other variables including fluctuations .",
    "there is another reason to include a growing @xmath2 term in the background .",
    "if the metric functions do not depend on @xmath2 , then in the limit of large @xmath2 the metrics @xmath5 and @xmath12 become decoupled .",
    "this is clearly seen from the bi - gravity action ( [ big ] ) .",
    "the decoupled system describes two massless gravitons and is a theory with a different number of degrees of freedom .",
    "switching on the interaction term , proportional to @xmath189 , is in this sense a discontinuous change to the theory . on the contrary , for a series of the form ( [ 1/l ] ) the two metrics never decouple .",
    "we first discuss the background equations and then the fluctuations . plugging ( [ 1/l ] ) in the background equations we find consistent equations for the coefficients @xmath246 order by order in @xmath247 .    at order zero",
    "one finds that @xmath248 and @xmath249 must be constants while @xmath250 satisfies the friedman equation @xmath251 thus , by choosing @xmath252 and @xmath35 appropriately we find a background evolution which is , at this order , indistinguishable from @xmath35cdm .",
    "corrections @xmath189 can be computed order by order .",
    "since @xmath2 is so far arbitrary we can make it as large as necessary in order to suppress @xmath189 corrections . for completeness",
    "we display the first order equations @xmath253 the equation for @xmath254 is longer and not really worth displaying .",
    "the important point is that once @xmath250 is known , the first order equations can be solved .",
    "we now explore the fluctuation equations in the same limit assuming that the background satisfies @xmath255 , @xmath256 . in this paragraph",
    "we work in terms of the original metric variables @xmath257 .",
    "we only consider here the leading terms .",
    "one finds that the newton potential @xmath236 satisfies the usual equation ( recall that for matter @xmath258 ) ) @xmath259 where @xmath260 .",
    "( we drop the subscript @xmath261 in @xmath262 because we work only to this order and no confusion can arise . ) for matter @xmath263 and we recover , as already shown in section [ ebicdm ] , the familiar @xmath264 , while for acceleration with @xmath265 we have @xmath266 .",
    "all other functions are expressed via the field equations in terms of @xmath267 as follows : @xmath268 where @xmath269 are integration constants .",
    "recalling the fluid variables ( [ fluid ] ) it is direct to prove from here that both ( [ matterf ] ) and the newton - poisson equation ( [ np ] ) are satisfied .",
    "the @xmath189 series provides a systematic way to isolate the dark matter phase . at the same time",
    ", it provides a way to compute order by order deviations from @xmath35cdm which may reveal new features .",
    "we shall study these corrections elsewhere .",
    "the main goal in our analysis is to estimate the two main cosmological observables : the cmb and the large scale structure of the distribution of galaxies in the universe .",
    "the anisotropies in the cmb can be described in terms of fluctuations in temperature , @xmath270/t_0 $ ] , where @xmath271 is the average temperature in the cmb and @xmath272 is the temperature measured in the direction @xmath273 .",
    "it is convenient to look at the variance of these fluctuations expanded in legendre polynomials , @xmath274 such that @xmath275 where @xmath276 is the ensemble average and @xmath277 is the angular power spectrum of fluctuations .",
    "we can calculate @xmath278 by evolving the boltzman equation for the radiation distrubution function , coupled to the perturbed field equations presented above .    as suggested above",
    ", the evolution of ebi field as dark matter is exactly equivalent to that of ordinary dark matter .",
    "hence its effect on the cmb will be equivalent and we therefore expect that such observables as the peak positions and heights will be preserved .",
    "this is clearly so if we look at the solid curve in figure [ fig_cl]- it is indistiguishable from @xmath35cdm .",
    "severe differences can arise depending on how the ebi field evolves in the accelerating era . if ebi continues to evolve as dark matter",
    "then the evolution of the gravitational potentials is such that , again , the angular power spectrum is indistinguishable from that of @xmath35cdm .",
    "this is clearly not so in the case where the ebi field drives acceleration .",
    "the large scale behaviour of the @xmath277s is strongly dependent on the integrated sachs wolfe effect which is roughly given by : @xmath279\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where primes , @xmath280 , are derivatives with respect to conformal time , @xmath166 is conformal time today and @xmath281 is conformal time at recombination .",
    "note that the combination of potentials is the same as presented in equation ( [ isw_pot ] ) and its evolutions is clearly different from the one experienced in the @xmath35ebi case . indeed in figure",
    "[ fig_potentials ] we plot the evolution of @xmath282 for a few cases labeled in figure [ equal_dist ] .",
    "quite clearly the unstable , oscillatory behaviour is triggered early on and hence we expect it affect relatively small scales .",
    "this is clear from looking at figure [ fig_cl ] where the modifications to the @xmath277s , through the integrated sachs - wolfe is present all the way to @xmath283 , well into the first peak .",
    "interestingly enough , for the phantom case , the accelerating phase kicks in later and hence there is a smaller integrated sachs - wolfe effect for @xmath284 ; once acceleration kicks in , however , it is much stronger than in the other cases and has a dramatic effect on the largest scales of the @xmath277s .    in the same way",
    ", we can directly relate the fluctuations in the galaxy distribution directly to the density contrast .",
    "it is convenient to look at the power spectrum of the density fluctuations by taking the fourier transform of @xmath285 , where @xmath286 is the wave number and constructing the variance : @xmath287 once again , we find that that the @xmath35 ebi model looks identical to a @xmath35cdm model . in figure [ fig_pk ]",
    "we plot such a model with a choice of parameters that render it indistinguishable from the best - fit wmap-5 @xmath35cdm model .",
    "it is clear that this is not true of the ebi model where we find that there is a strong shortage of power on small scales as well as a much broader turnover associated to the radiation matter transition .",
    "the effect is sufficiently dramatic that we do nt even attempt to compare the ebi model to the angular power spectrum as measured by wmap-5 @xcite or the power spectrum of galaxy fluctuations as measured by the sloan digital sky survey @xcite in figure [ fig_cl_pk]- the ebi model is not a viable candidate for a theory of structure formation- while the @xmath35ebi model is quite clearly a good candidate .",
    "the evolution of perturbations in the ebi model do have an interesting feature that is worth noting . in theories of pressureless dark matter , such as wimps ,",
    "the evolution of perturbations is such that the two gravitational potentials are effectively identical , i.e. @xmath288 .",
    "it has been pointed out that in many , if not all , theories of modified gravity , these potentials will differ from each other @xcite and that this may be a smoking gun for modified theories of gravity .",
    "a plethora of observational techniques have been proposed , cross correlating galaxy surveys with weak lensing surveys and with measurements of the cmb @xcite and is one of the main science targets of up and coming experiments such as the euclid project . as pointed out in @xcite",
    "such a signature is not exclusive to modified gravity and it suffices that the dark sector have a component that takes the form of anisotropic stress .",
    "this is indeed what we find in this theory and specifically in the case of ebi , where @xmath210 and @xmath209 can have a substantial effect on the evolution of perturbations . in figure [ fig_potentials_minus ]",
    "we illustrate this fact by plotting the evolution of @xmath289 for a selection of models .",
    "granted that we have been unable to find an ebi model that fits the data and the question still remains whether it is still possible to constrain a fundamental theory of dark matter with @xmath289 .",
    "in this paper we have explored the cosmology of universe permeated by a field that obeys the eddington - born - infeld equation .",
    "as shown in @xcite , such a field can play the dual role of dark matter and dark energy and therefore supplies us with a counterpart to the chaplygin gas as a possible unification of the dark sector . in our analysis",
    "we have shown that there are other regimes in which the ebi field can play a different role , either as an alternative to simply dark matter or as a source of energy that can renormalize the cosmological constant .",
    "we have then looked at the effect the ebi field has on the growth of structure .",
    "we show that it can be described in terms of a set of fluid variables , akin to the construction of @xcite and then identify the different key regimes . during the dark matter",
    "dominated regime , i.e. the regime in which @xmath290 and the ebi field dominates , the evolution of perturbation is exactly as in the standard scenario in which the dark matter field is described by massive , non - relativistic particles .",
    "the gravitational potentials are constant and indistinguishable during this era , under the assumption that the initial shear and entropy is negligible .",
    "distinctive signatures emerge in a period of accelerated expansion .",
    "if the ebi field dominates and is responsible for cosmic acceleration , there is a clear instability in the gravitational potentials ; they not only grow but @xmath282 diverges leading very rapidly to an overwhelming integrated sachs - wolfe effect on large scales .",
    "it is difficult to reconcile the angular power spectrum of fluctuations and the power spectrum of the galaxy distribution predicted by an ebi theory which unifies the dark sector , with current data . if we restrict ourselves to a regime in which the ebi field simply behaves as dark matter , then , as expected , we find the our best fit model to be entirely indistinguishable from the standard , @xmath35cdm scenario",
    ".    the ebi field can clearly play an important role in cosmology and , in particular , as a non - particulate form of dark matter .",
    "it s interpretation becomes interesting if we view the theory as bi - metric and @xmath12 as the true , geometric , metric of space - time ; it is then this metric which is interpreted as dark matter .",
    "this is the point of view implicit in @xcite .",
    "what we mean by the `` true '' metric of space - time is of course open to debate .",
    "clocks and rulers will feel @xmath5 and hence real geometry will be built out of it and in this case @xmath12 plays a purely auxiliary role as an extra field .",
    "we would like to re - emphasize that the generalized ebi model , in which the ebi field drives cosmic acceleration , gives us an interesting example of a theory with an exotic signature : the mismatch between @xmath267 and @xmath291 .",
    "a number of methods have been proposed to do ease out this mismatch from current and future data sets @xcite .",
    "we have found that the ebi field can source this mismatch without modifying gravity .",
    "this is not surprising : the ebi field is a two tensor with four scalar degrees of freedom .",
    "one linear combination of these degrees of freedom can be seen as anisotropic stress which can freely source the @xmath289 .",
    "it turns out that its effect is severe enough that the integrated sachs - wolfe effects generated is too extreme to be reconcilable with current observations .",
    "but it does suggest that it may be possible to build models which do nt modify gravity , generate accelerated expansion and could be confused with bona - fide modified theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "consistent parameterized frameworks such as  @xcite may be able to provide alternative ways to distinguish such theories and it would be interesting to find the ebi s predictions for these frameworks .    finally , we would like to point out that the ebi model is a viable alternative to the @xmath35cdm but which may have particular features which make it stand out . as we saw in section [ ebicdm ] , even though the evolution of perturbations may be equivalent to that of that cdm if one assume no pressure perturbations and shear in the initial conditions , the non - linear evolution will be different .",
    "pressure perturbations and shear will be generated at the non - linear level and may play a significant role in the small scale structure of galaxies and clusters .",
    "indeed , one of the major problems that @xmath35cdm has had to face is the excess of small scale power compared to observations @xcite .",
    "@xmath35ebi may have a natural dynamical solution to this problem .",
    "this is one of the many aspects of this theory we wish to explore further .",
