    "if supersymmetry ( susy ) exists at the electroweak scale , then gluinos and squarks will be copiously produced in pairs at the lhc and will decay via cascades involving other susy particles .",
    "the characteristics of these decays and hence of the signals that will be observed and the measurements that will be made depend upon the actual susy model and in particular on the pattern of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "previous , detailed studies of signals for susy at the lhc@xcite have used the sugra model @xcite , in which the supersymmetry breaking is transmitted to the sector of the theory containing the standard model particles and their superpartners via gravitational interactions .",
    "the minimal version of this model has just four parameters plus a sign .",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( @xmath2 ) has a mass of order 100  gev , is stable , is produced in the decay of every other supersymmetric particle and is neutral and therefore escapes the detector . the strong production cross sections and the characteristic signals of events with multiple jets plus missing energy @xmath3 or with like - sign dileptons @xmath4 plus @xmath3@xcite enable susy to be extracted trivially from standard model backgrounds .",
    "characteristic signals were identified that can be exploited to determine , with great precision , the fundamental parameters of these model over the whole of its parameter space .",
    "variants of this model where r - parity is broken@xcite and the @xmath2 is unstable have also been discussed@xcite",
    ".    there also exists a class of gauge mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) models@xcite in which the supersymmetry breaking is mediated by gauge interactions .",
    "the model assumes that supersymmetry is broken with a scale @xmath5 in a sector of the theory which contains heavy non - standard - model particles .",
    "this sector then couples to a set of particles with standard model interactions , called messengers , which have a mass of order @xmath6 .",
    "these messengers are taken to be complete representations of su(5 ) so as to preserve the coupling constant unification of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "the mass splitting between the superpartners in the messenger multiplets is controlled by @xmath5 .",
    "one ( two ) loop graphs involving these messenger fields , then give mass to superpartners of the gauge bosons ( quarks and leptons ) of the standard model .",
    "this model is preferred by some because the superpartners of the standard model particles get their masses via gauge interactions , so there are no flavor changing neutral currents , which can be problematic in the sugra models .",
    "the characteristic spectra of superparticles are different from those in the sugra model ; in particular , the lightest supersymmetric particle is now the gravitino ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "this particle has feeble interactions and can be produced with significant rate only in the decays of particles which have no other decay channels . in the sugra models , @xmath7 has a mass of order 1 tev and is phenomenologically irrelevant ( except possibly for cosmology ) . in gmsb models , the next lightest supersymmetric particle , which we will refer to as the nlsp , decays into @xmath7 .",
    "the lifetime of the nlsp is very model dependent : @xmath8 .",
    "as it is not stable , it can either be charged or neutral .    if the nlsp is neutral , it is the lightest combination ( @xmath9 ) of gauginos and higgsinos , and it behaves , except for its decay , in the same manner as the @xmath2 in the sugra model .",
    "( the rather unlikely possibility that it is a gluino@xcite is not explored in this paper . )",
    "if its lifetime is very long so that none of the produced @xmath2 decay within the detector , the phenomenology is very similar to that in the sugra models .    if the nlsp is charged , it is most likely to be the partner of a right handed lepton .",
    "two cases are distinguished . if @xmath10 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs fields , is small , then @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are degenerate . if @xmath14 is large , @xmath13 is the lightest slepton and the others can decay into it with short lifetimes .",
    "if the lifetime of the nlsp is very long , each susy event contains two apparently stable charged particles @xcite .",
    "if it is short , each event contains two charged leptons from each of the decays .    the simulation in this paper is based on the implementation of the minimal gmsb model in isajet@xcite .",
    "the model is characterized by @xmath15 , the susy breaking mass scale ; @xmath16 , the messenger mass ; @xmath17 , the number of equivalent @xmath18 messenger fields ; @xmath14 , the usual ratio of vacuum expectation values of the higgs fields that couple to the charge 2/3 and 1/3 quarks ; @xmath19 , the sign of the @xmath20 term , the value @xmath21 being determined by the @xmath22 mass from usual radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ; and @xmath23 , the scale factor for the gravitino mass which determines the nlsp lifetime ( @xmath24 ) . at the scale @xmath16 , for example ,",
    "the masses of the gluino , squark and slepton are given by @xmath25 here @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the coupling constants of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "these masses are then evolved from the scale @xmath16 to the weak scale , inducing a logarithmic dependence on @xmath16 . as in the case of the sugra models",
    ", this evolution leads to the spontaneous breaking of electro - weak symmetry as the large top quark yukawa coupling of the top ( and possibly bottom ) quark induces a negative mass - squared of the higgs field(s ) . from these equations it can be seen that as @xmath17 is increased the slepton masses increase more slowly than the gaugino masses .",
    "hence only for small values of @xmath17 will the nlsp be a @xmath32 , at larger values it is a ( right ) slepton .",
    "messenger fields in other representations of su(5 ) can be included by modifying the value of @xmath17 .",
    "if there are several messengers with different masses their effects can be approximated by changing @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , we will consider @xmath17 to be a continuous variable when we estimate how well it can be measured at lhc .",
    "this paper presents a series of case studies for this model which illustrate its characteristic features .",
    "we use the four sets of parameters shown in table 1 .",
    "these cases are paired and differ only in the value of @xmath33 and hence in the lifetime of the nlsp .",
    "the masses of the superpartners of the standard model fields are given in table 2 . in cases g1a and g1b , the nlsp is @xmath34 ; its lifetime is quite short , @xmath35 , in the former case and long , @xmath36  km , in the latter . in cases g2a and g2b the nlsp is a stau . in the latter case",
    "it has a very long lifetime , @xmath37 , and exits a detector without decaying .",
    "the decay @xmath38 is not kinematically allowed , so the @xmath39 and @xmath40 are also long lived . in the case of point g2a ,",
    "the @xmath41 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are short lived with @xmath42 @xmath20 m .",
    "the production cross section for supersymmetric particles is quite large ; 7.6 pb and 22 pb at lowest order in qcd for cases g1 and g2 respectively .",
    "note that the larger value of @xmath17 in the case of g2 results in considerably smaller squark masses and hence the larger cross section ; the gluino masses are very similar .",
    ".parameters for the four case studies in this paper.[params ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the errors on @xmath43 are determined by minos@xcite .",
    "we can expect systematic uncertainties of order @xmath44 on these measurements .",
    "we therefore expect that the precision of the upper edge will be limited by statistics even for 100  fb@xmath45 of data . for the purposes of parameter fitting below",
    ", we will assume that the errors are 70 and 270  mev for 10  fb@xmath45 and 50 and 180  mev for 100  fb@xmath45 respectively .",
    "-14pt      here we use the decay chain @xmath47 . the same event selection as in section  [ sec : g2alep ]",
    "is used with the addition of the requirement that the dilepton pair have mass @xmath48 gev and transverse momentum @xmath49 gev to enhance the probability that the leptons come from the same decay chain .",
    "the two jets with the largest transverse momentum were then selected ; each is required to have @xmath50 and and to contain least 4 charged tracks .",
    "we show the invariant mass of the dilepton and one of these two jets ( @xmath51 ) in figure  [ stau1_mllq ] and of one the leptons and a jet in ( @xmath52 ) distributions are show in figure  [ stau1_mlq ] . in each case only the smaller of the various mass combinations is plotted and again we shown the subtracted distributions @xmath53 which have a cleaner structure .",
    "-14pt    the @xmath54 distribution has an expected endpoint at @xmath55 while the @xmath56 distribution has an expected endpoint at @xmath57 the plots show a linear fit below the end points .",
    "these fits extrapolate to end points slightly larger than the actual values .",
    "the errors on the precision of these values will be dominated by the systematic uncertainties in the jet energy scales estimated to be of order 1% .",
    "we expect that the systematic uncertainty in the measurement of the _ ratio _ of these two end - points will be less than this .",
    "-14pt    we can now solve for the @xmath58 , @xmath2 , and @xmath46 masses in terms of the measured endpoints : @xmath59 note that this method for extracting masses requires only the existence of the decay chain ; the underlying model is not used in the analysis .",
    "of course the interpretation of the masses as those of @xmath46 , @xmath58 , _ etc .",
    "_ , is model dependent .",
    "approximately 50% of the decays of @xmath61 occur to a @xmath60 .",
    "there is a decay chain starting from @xmath60 proceeding through a slepton and a @xmath2 that gives a final state with three isolated leptons _ viz . _",
    "@xmath62 the combined branching ratio is 29% .",
    "we begin with the event selection of the previous section , requiring that there be at least three isolated leptons in addition to the jets .",
    "events are then required to have at least one opposite sign , same flavor pair with an invariant mass in the range @xmath63 gev @xmath64 52 gev so that they are likely to have come from a @xmath2 decay .",
    "any other pairs of leptons of same flavor and opposite sign with @xmath65 175 gev are discarded as they are likely to come from @xmath66 decay .",
    "the selected dilepton is then combined with any other remaining lepton and the invariant mass of the trio is shown in figure  [ tri - lep ] . if all three selected leptons arose from the decay of @xmath60 , this distribution would have a linear vanishing at @xmath67 there is considerable background in this plot .",
    "nevertheless there is clear evidence of structure .",
    "while it may not prove possible to extract a precision measurement from this distribution , it provides evidence for the existence of @xmath60 and a strong consistency check of the model .    -14pt",
    "in this case the nlsp is the @xmath68 , and it has a long lifetime , @xmath69 .",
    "the decay @xmath38 is not kinematically allowed , so the @xmath39 and @xmath40 are also long - lived .",
    "each event will contain two of these quasi - stable particles which will appear in the detector as a pair of slow muons .",
    "these will provide a trigger as the mean velocity is quite large ( see below ) and the first evidence for new physics in this case .",
    "a small fraction of the sleptons will decay within the detector ; significant energy is released in the decay so the result is a track which ends somewhere and a decay product that points back to this end point .",
    "if the sparticle in question is a selectron , the resulting electron could be pointed back using the electromagnetic calorimeter in combination with information from the central tracker .",
    "if the sparticle is a smuon , the resulting muon would have to be pointed using the remainder of the tracking volume and the outer muon system .",
    "if it is a stau , the resulting hadronic decay of the tau might be pointed using a combination of the central tracker and the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "it is worth emphasizing the importance of measuring this decay length : it is the only way to obtain information on the gravitino couplings and the fundamental scale of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the events can be triggered using the quasi - stable particles that will appear as muons .",
    "the velocity distribution of these particles is shown in figure  [ beta ] , from which it can be seen that the mean velocity is greater than @xmath70 .",
    "hence many of these should pass the atlas level-1 muon trigger@xcite .",
    "the events also have a large amount of missing @xmath71 as measured by the calorimeter .",
    "the distribution is shown in figure  [ etmiss ] , which has a mean value of @xmath72 .",
    "if the measured momenta of the sleptons is included , the missing energy is much smaller as can be seen from the dotted curve in figure  [ etmiss ] .",
    "the true missing @xmath71 is larger than standard model backgrounds due to the larger number of taus and heavy flavors in the susy sample .",
    "the standard model background shown on this plot is controlled by the requirement that it contain at least two muons .",
    "this calorimetric missing @xmath71 could also be used as a trigger .    -14pt",
    "-14pt    we begin the analysis by using the effective mass distribution found by selecting events that have at least four jets and forming scalar sum of the @xmath73 s of the four hardest jets and the missing transverse energy @xmath3 , @xmath74 here the jet @xmath73 s have been ordered such that @xmath75 is the transverse momentum of the leading jet .",
    "there is no requirement that the jets or missing @xmath71 be large enough to provide a trigger ; we assume that the events are triggered by the muon system .",
    "note that the standard model background shown on this plot is required to have two muons in it and is suppressed as a result .",
    "the nlsp s are ignored when making this effective mass variable . the distribution shown in figure  [ meff ] ,",
    "has a mean value of @xmath76 characteristic of the masses of the strongly interacting sparticles which dominate the production .",
    "there is a peak in the effective mass distribution at zero , corresponding to the production of events which have little hadronic activity and @xmath3 .",
    "it is due to the direct production of nslp via such processes as @xmath77 and the direct production of @xmath32 and @xmath78 which then decay to the nlsp .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ ident ] which shows the i d codes for the produced primary sparticles and demonstrates that they are mainly sleptons and gauginos .",
    "we will discuss these events in more detail below .    -14pt",
    "-14pt      the sleptons ( nlsp ) are dominantly produced at the end of decay chains and consequently the majority of them are fast .",

    "for each slepton with @xmath80 the time delay relative to @xmath81 to the outer layer of the muon system , taken to be a cylinder with a radius of @xmath82 and a half - length of @xmath83 , is calculated using the generated momentum and smeared with a gaussian @xmath79 resolution .",
    "the smeared time delay @xmath84 and measured momentum are then use to calculate a mass .",
    "the resulting mass distribution is shown in figure  [ mslep ] for sleptons with @xmath85 .",
    "raising the lower limit on @xmath84 improves the mass resolution but reduces the efficiency .",
    "the resolution is never good enough to resolve the @xmath68 and @xmath86 masses of @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the upper limit on @xmath84 is somewhat arbitrary ; it reflects practical concerns and also eliminates sleptons with very low @xmath89 that lose most of their energy in the calorimeter .",
    "the average of the generated distribution , @xmath90 , agrees well with the fitted mean value in figure  [ mslep ] .",
    "it is important to note that this method will provide an mass measurement of an average over the @xmath68 , @xmath12 and @xmath11 masses as this analysis can not distinguish slepton flavors .",

    "the two highest @xmath73 particles among the sleptons and muons ( _ i.e. _ those particles that penetrate to the muon system ) are assumed to be sleptons and are assigned their measured @xmath95 and the slepton mass ; the rest are assumed to be muons .",
    "the standard model background is already negligible , so there is no need to make a time - of - flight cut to identify the sleptons .",

    "the rather strange shape of the @xmath2 peak is a consequence of the fact that the splitting between the @xmath2 and @xmath58 is small , so the mass is dominated by the rest mass of the @xmath58 .",
    "there is a small peak at 348 gev due to the decay of @xmath98 .",

    "each step in the chain provides a constraint and sufficient constraints can occur that together with the measurement of @xmath3 enables the event to be reconstructed . in such cases",
    "the masses of the superparticles in the decay chain can be measured directly rather than inferred from kinematic distributions .    in all of the cases discussed in this paper , as in the sugra cases discussed previously @xcite",
    ", the lhc will be capable of making many precise measurements that will enable the underlying model of supersymmetry to be severely constrained should supersymmetric particles be observed .",
    "the key to all of these analyses is the ability to identify a characteristic final state arising from the decay of a sparticle that is copiously produced .",
    "the main such decays that have been used in the sugra and gmsb analyses done so far are :    * dileptons from @xmath218 or @xmath219 ; * taus from the decays @xmath220 or @xmath221 , which can dominate when @xmath14 is large ; * @xmath222 .    in the case of gmsb or @xmath223-parity breaking models",
    "the subsequent decay of @xmath2 can provide additional information and constraints .",
    "of course the information extracted in this way is only a small fraction of the total available .",
    "a complete analysis will involve generating large samples of events for many susy models and comparing all possible distributions with experiment .",
