    "the other is a blended object consisting of an emission line galaxy and an m - star .",
    "increasing or decreasing the internal dust extinction increases the offset between the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts and increases the random scatter . as varying the dust extinction does not improve the accuracy of the photometric redshifts , we use the constant value of @xmath73 .",

    "in addition , in figure  [ fig : dndz ] , the model redshift distribution of the most luminous red galaxies shows evidence of individual structures .",
    "we therefore assume that the @xmath195 difference between the clustering of luminous galaxies in the ndwfs and 2dfgrs is due cosmic variance .",
    "even if cosmic variance were not an issue , it is difficult to measure clustering evolution with galaxies in the absolute magnitude range where @xmath5 is strongly correlated with luminosity as small luminosity errors can translate into large errors in @xmath5 .",
    "it is therefore preferable to measure clustering evolution with @xmath196 galaxies , as we have done in ",
    "[ sec : z ] .    as the correlation between @xmath5 and spectral type is relatively weak in the ndwfs and 2dfgrs , our measurements of the evolution of clustering are not sensitive to small errors in the estimates of the spectral types .",
    "the strong correlation between @xmath5 and absolute magnitude for luminous galaxies is a prediction of recent large volume @xmath12cdm simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : r0mag ] , a @xmath197 @xmath12cdm simulation with galaxy selection criteria similar to the @xmath198 sample ( * ? ? ?",
    "* a. benson 2002 , private communication ) is a good approximation of the clustering of @xmath199 red galaxies .",
    "the evolution of spatial clustering galaxies was studied with @xmath10 red galaxies .",
    "luminous galaxies were excluded as their spatial clustering is strongly correlated with absolute magnitude and small redshift or spectral evolution errors could produce large changes in the measured spatial clustering .",
    "the faint limit was chosen to allow the same range of absolute magnitudes to be studied over a broad redshift range .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : r0 ] and table  [ table : r0z ] , no significant evolution of @xmath5 ( comoving ) occurs over the redshift range studied .",
    "two models of the clustering of red galaxies , derived from the gif @xmath12cdm simulations @xcite , are plotted in figure  [ fig : r0 ] and provide good approximations to the measured clustering from the ndwfs , sdss and 2dfgrs .",
    "the @xcite model predicts the clustering of early - type galaxies with stellar masses of @xmath200 while the benson ( 2002 , private communication ) simulation models the clustering of @xmath201 , @xmath202 galaxies .",
    "if the evolution of the underlying dark matter distribution at @xmath91 is well described by the linear or quasi - linear growth of density perturbations , the bias of red galaxies must be rapidly evolving with redshift .",
    "the evolution of @xmath5 was empirically measured by estimating the clustering evolution parameter @xmath161 ( from equation  [ eq : ep ] ) .",
    "the @xmath203 and @xmath204 bins were assumed to be independent estimates of @xmath5 at the median redshifts of their model redshift distributions .",
    "the 2dfgrs and sdss clustering estimates were also included to provide additional constraints on @xmath161 .",
    "the selection criteria for the ndwfs @xmath176 sample allow direct comparison with the 2dfgrs early - type sample of @xcite .",
    "the present - day colors of the ndwfs @xmath176 sample are only @xmath205 magnitudes redder in @xmath100 than the sdss @xmath101 sample of @xcite .",
    "the best - fit estimates of @xmath161 are summarized in table  [ table : ep ] and plotted in figure  [ fig : epev ] .",
    "models with @xmath162 are rejected with @xmath206 confidence when constraints from the 2dfgrs are included with the ndwfs data .",
    "the evolution of @xmath5 is consistent with clustering fixed in comoving coordinates ( @xmath163 ) at @xmath90 .",
    "the clustering of red galaxies undergoes little or no evolution from @xmath207 to the present - day . at @xmath208 ,",
    "the only published clustering study using comparable template selection criteria is that of @xcite which used galaxies fitted with the evolving e and sbc templates of the hyperz photometric redshift code @xcite .",
    "their estimate of @xmath209 , with @xmath130 assumed to be @xmath210 , is consistent with @xmath5 remaining fixed in comoving coordinates to @xmath211 .",
    "however , to differentiate between currently plausible @xmath12cdm models larger survey areas , on the order of the complete ndwfs ( @xmath212 ) , will be required .",
    "further constraints on the clustering of @xmath213 galaxies are available from samples of qsos @xcite and @xmath214 extremely red objects ( eros ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the qso spatial correlation function , measured in redshift space ( @xmath215 replacing @xmath5 ) , marginally increases from @xmath216 with @xmath217 at @xmath218 to @xmath219 with @xmath220 at @xmath221 @xcite .",
    "however , as pointed out by @xcite , interpretation of qso clustering relies on poorly constrained models of qsos lifetimes and host populations as a function of redshift .",
    "eros are easier to relate to low redshift populations than qsos as the majority appear to be the progenitors of early - type galaxies with the remainder being dusty starbursts @xcite .",
    "eros could therefore extend the redshift range of early - type spatial correlation function evolution estimates to @xmath211 . with the exception of @xmath222 eros in the las campanas infrared survey @xcite ,",
    "all eros clustering studies measure @xmath223 @xcite .",
    "this is comparable to the clustering of the most luminous red and early - type galaxies at @xmath91 .",
    "if @xmath224 eros correspond to @xmath225 galaxies @xcite , the ero clustering results are difficult to reconcile with @xmath91 studies and @xmath12cdm theory .",
    "the clustering of red @xmath13 galaxies in the ndwfs can be increased to @xmath226 only by increasing the photometric redshift @xmath35 uncertainties to @xmath227 of the photometric redshifts or increasing the stellar contamination to @xmath227 .",
    "these scenarios are inconsistent with the redshift comparisons in figure  [ fig : photoz ] and the lack of a stellar locus in figure  [ fig : col ] .",
    "the discrepancy between the ero @xmath5 values and @xmath91 studies could be due to errors in the ero model redshift distributions used to deproject the angular correlation function .",
    "@xcite , who measure @xmath228 for @xmath222 eros , have few @xmath229 objects while the @xcite and @xcite models have a significant fraction of eros at @xmath230 .",
    "improved constraints on ero clustering should be provided with model redshift distributions constrained with photometric redshifts which have been verified with spectroscopic samples .",
    "the clustering of eros , as measured from the ndwfs , will be described in a future paper ( brown et al .",
    ", in preparation ) using a @xmath231 dataset .",
    "we have used the noao deep wide - field survey to measure the clustering of @xmath232 red galaxies .",
    "the wide - field and @xmath2 bands allow large galaxy samples to be selected as a function of spectral type and absolute magnitude using photometric redshifts .",
    "pegase2 spectral evolution models with exponentially decreasing star formation rates have been used to select an evolutionary sequence of related galaxies as a function of redshift . the red sample , with present - day rest - frame colors of @xmath4 ,",
    "was chosen to allow direct comparison with the low redshift early - type sample from the 2dfgrs .",
    "the clustering of red galaxies is strongly correlated with luminosity , with @xmath5 increasing from @xmath6 at @xmath7 to @xmath8 at @xmath9 .",
    "clustering evolution measurements with samples where the distribution of spectral types and luminosities are a function of redshift will be dominated by selection effects .",
    "the strength of @xmath5 ( comoving ) as a function of absolute magnitude in our sample is comparable to estimates at @xmath172 from the 2dfgrs , with differences at high luminosity being attributable to structures of sizes comparable to the field - of - view .",

    "@xmath4 galaxies , the largest sample studied , the value of @xmath5 is @xmath233 with @xmath130 fixed at @xmath171 .",
