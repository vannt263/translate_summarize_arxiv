    "the strong field approximation ( sfa ) @xcite is a key technique in the study of interactions of matter with intense laser fields . in particular ,",
    "the sfa is used to describe high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) @xcite .",
    "the three - step model ( tsm ) @xcite , which is based on the sfa , has proven very successful describing much of the experimental behavior .",
    "the best known examples are the cutoff formula @xcite and time - frequency structure of the hhg signal @xcite , which led to the prediction of attosecond pulses @xcite .",
    "reviews can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it has been long known however that the tsm is incorrect by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude predicting the spectral intensity of hhg in atomic hydrogen , as found from comparisons with numerically - exact results @xcite . for the @xmath2 ion",
    "the tsm gives a spectrum which is _ many _ orders of magnitude away from numerically - exact results @xcite , and the shape of the spectrum can be heavily distorted @xcite .",
    "hhg experiments are now coming to the point where more accurate theory is needed .",
    "the race towards harnessing hhg for a coherent short wavelength source @xcite can benefit from quantitative theoretical estimates of the hhg efficiency , which to date are very scarce @xcite .",
    "the recent orbital imaging experiment @xcite uses the hhg spectrum to infer the structure of a molecular orbital , which also requires quantitatively reliable theory , capable of giving a precise description of the shape of the hhg spectrum .    in a recent theoretical work @xcite we proposed a modified version of the tsm , where the sfa wavefunction is used with the dipole operator in the acceleration rather than the length form .",
    "comparison of the tsm with a numerical solution of the time dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) then demonstrated excellent quantitative agreement for atomic hydrogen , and significantly improved agreement for the @xmath2 ion . the argument why using the acceleration form improves the tsm so much was that the tsm then becomes correct to first order in the binding potential ( we shall henceforth refer to the tsm obtained this way as @xmath0-order tsm ) , whereas the standard tsm @xcite ( @xmath1-order tsm ) is correct to zeroth order in the binding potential .",
    "this work is a followup on ref .",
    "@xcite , and it has three goals .",
    "first , the first - order accuracy of the @xmath0-order tsm is established .",
    "second , a detailed and general comparison between the @xmath0-order tsm and the @xmath3-order tsm is given .",
    "it is shown that the two always disagree with respect to the connection between the orbital symmetry and the positions of the minima in the hhg spectrum , as demonstrated for @xmath4 @xcite .",

    "( [ reqs2 ] ) ] , a good approximation for the evolution of the ground state can be found using the adiabatic theorem @xcite : it is approximately given by @xmath146 , where the @xmath147 and @xmath148 are the field - dependent ground state wavefunction and energy , defined through the eigenvalue equation @xmath149 the adiabatic theorem holds even though @xmath147 becomes a resonance @xcite .",
    "if we neglect the stark shift of the energy , we obtain @xmath150 .",

    "in fact , eq .  ( [ ansatz ] ) itself is obtained for @xmath152 .",
    "the discussion can be extended to at least one common gauge , namely the velocity gauge .",

    "the large discrepancy between the @xmath1-order tsm hhg spectra and numerically - exact calculations has been attributed long ago @xcite to the sfa wavefunction being inaccurate .",
    "it is often argued that this sfa wavefunction is especially inaccurate for molecules @xcite .",
    "this work strongly supports these ideas : the length and acceleration forms of the dipole operator used on the same sfa wavefunction are shown to give dramatically different results , especially for molecules . for an exact wavefunction",
    "the results would be identical , and thus the large discrepancy is evidence for the inaccuracy of the wavefunction .",
    "since the wavefunction is so far from being exact , it is especially important to use it properly . in this work",
    "we have argued that together with the acceleration form of the dipole , the zeroth - order sfa wavefunction leads to an approximation ( the @xmath0-order tsm ) with first - order overall accuracy in the binding potential .",
    "since the wavefunction itself is so inaccurate , it can lead to very large errors if used otherwise than in the specially - suited way introduced in this work .",

    "we have shown that the continuum - continuum term in the @xmath0-order tsm is negligible compared to the bound - continuum term .",
    "therefore , the widely - used @xmath1-order tsm is upgraded to first - order accuracy by simply replacing @xmath10 by @xmath153 in the recombination amplitude , which is simple to implement .",
    "the @xmath0-order tsm shows excellent agreement with numerically - exact results for atoms @xcite and good agreement for @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the sfa decomposes the wavefunction into a continuum , and a quasi - bound ground state .",
    "this is justified , since the strong laser field smears the excited states of the unperturbed system and turns them into a continuum @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the continuum is approximated by the volkov propagator , which can be corrected order by order in the binding potential .",
    "the quasi - bound state however should be treated separately .",

    "this is commonly the case in single - electron models of multi - electron atoms .",
    "then the states lying energetically below the initial state are also quasi - bound , and should also be treated separately .",
