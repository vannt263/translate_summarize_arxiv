    "many cosmological observations @xcite , such as the type ia supernova(sn ia ) , wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe(wmap ) , the sloan digital sky survey(sdss ) etc . , support that our universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion .",
    "this accelerated expansion is always attributed to the dark energy with negative pressure which induces repulsive gravity 5,6 . except for the property of negative pressure",
    ", we do not know too much about the components and other properties of the dark energy .",
    "what is more , we have no idea about how the dark energy evolves .",
    "various dark energy models have been proposed to describe the evolution , all of which must be constrained by astronomical observations . in these models ,",
    "the equation of state @xmath2 plays a key role and can reveal the nature of dark energy which accelerates the universe , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the pressure and energy density of the dark energy respectively .",
    "different equations of state lead to different dynamical changes and may influence the evolution of our universe . @xmath5 and",
    "its time derivative with respect to hubble time @xmath6(where @xmath7 is scale factor ) are currently constrained by the distance measurements of sn ia , and the current observational data constrain the range of equation of state as @xmath8 @xcite . the cosmological constant model with equation of state @xmath9 , which is considered as the most acceptable candidate for dark energy has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the quintessence scalar field with @xmath5 in the range from @xmath10 to @xmath11 has been investigated in @xcite . the phantom scalar field with @xmath12 , which can introduce the negative kinetic energy and violate the well known energy condition , has been found in @xcite .",
    "in order to get more information on dark energy , it has been widely discussed from the thermodynamical viewpoints , such as thermodynamics of dark energy with constant @xmath13 in the range @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 in the de sitter space - time and anti - de sitter space - time @xcite , @xmath16 in the phantom field @xcite and the generalized chaplygin gas @xcite and so on .",
    "more discussions on the thermodynamics of dark energy can be found in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the thermodynamical properties of an accelerated expanding universe driven by dark energy with the equation of state @xmath0 and the hubble parameter @xmath17 $ ] ( where @xmath18 is the hubble constant and @xmath19 is the parameter of matter density ) .",
    "this model is in agreement with the observations in low redshift , where the parameter @xmath20 and @xmath21 are suggested by @xcite .",
    "though combining quantum mechanics with general relativity , it was discovered that a black hole can emit particles .",
    "the temperature of a black hole is proportional to its surface gravity and the entropy is also proportional to its surface area @xcite .",
    "the hawking temperature is given as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the surface gravity of a black hole , and the entropy of a black hole is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is its surface area .",
    "hawking temperature , black hole entropy , and the black hole mass satisfy the first law of thermodynamics @xmath26 @xcite . if a charged black hole is rotating , the thermodynamical first law is expressed as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 are the dragged velocity , angular momentum , electric potential and charge of a black hole respectively .",
    "the event horizon of a stationary black hole is considered as the system boundary @xcite , inside which the black hole should maintain thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "if our universe can be considered as a thermodynamical system@xcite , the thermodynamical properties of the black hole can be generalized to space - time enveloped by the apparent horizon or the event horizon .",
    "the thermodynamical properties of the universe may be similar to those of the black hole , the thermodynamical laws should be satisfied .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec ii , we examine the thermodynamical first and the second laws on the apparent horizon with @xmath32 . in sec iii",
    ", we similarly examine the thermodynamical laws on the event horizon . in sec iv",
    ", we draw some conclusions and discussions .",
    "the friedmann - robertson - walker metric is @xcite @xmath33 if setting @xmath34the dynamical apparent horizon can be determined by the relation@xmath35 so we can get the apparent horizon radius @xmath36 the wmap data suggest that our universe is spatially flat with @xmath37 , so the apparent horizon is @xmath38 in this case .",
    "the surface gravity on the apparent horizon is @xmath39and the temperature is @xmath40    in this paper , we concentrate on a more general model with @xmath41 .   \\label{x2}\\ ] ] as we just want to know more properties about dark energy , we take @xmath42 . and the hubble parameter becomes @xmath43 in this section we use temperature , entropy and energy to examine the first and the second laws of thermodynamics on the apparent horizon",
    ". the temperature and entropy of the universe on the apparent horizon are @xmath44 and @xmath24 respectively .    when calculating the flux of energy through the area @xmath45 of the apparent horizon , we treat the horizon as a static surface , but allowing it to vary slowly with time .",
    "the amount of energy flux @xcite crossing the apparent horizon within the time interval @xmath46 is   @xmath47the entropy of the apparent horizon is @xmath48 and its differential form is @xmath49 thus we can get @xmath50from eq.(9 ) and eq.(12 ) , we obtain the result @xmath51 , so the first law of thermodynamics on the apparent horizon of this redshift - dependent model is confirmed .",
    "the entropy of the universe inside the apparent horizon is related to its energy and pressure through @xmath52the energy inside the apparent horizon is @xmath53 and the volume is @xmath54 .",
    "so we get @xmath55 in which @xmath0 and @xmath56 .",
    "thus we can get the derivative of @xmath57 with respect to @xmath1 @xmath58for the entropy of the apparent horizon , we get@xmath59and the derivation of @xmath60 with respect to @xmath61 is @xmath62    the total entropy varies with redshift @xmath61 , so its derivation is    @xmath63    considering the relation @xmath64 , we get @xmath65 we find that the total entropy of the apparent horizon does not decrease with time and the second thermodynamical law is satisfied on the apparent horizon .",
    "the event horizon of the universe is the position of the greatest distance that an particle can reach at a particular cosmic epoch , so the definition of the event horizon is @xmath66    the energy flux through the event horizon can be similarly expressed as    @xmath67    meanwhile , we get @xmath68the entropy of the event horizon is@xmath69using hawking temperature of the event horizon , we can also obtain @xmath70    it is shown in fig.1 and fig.2 that @xmath71 in the higher redshift , @xmath72 is in agreement with @xmath73 , but in the lower redshift , they are not consistent .",
    "therefore , the first law of thermodynamics with the usual definition of entropy and temperature on the event horizon is not always confirmed .    for the entropy of matter and fluids inside the event horizon , we have@xmath74the energy inside the event horizon is @xmath75 , so we get @xmath76the entropy of the event horizon is @xmath77 , so we have @xmath78similarly we get @xmath79\\frac{dr_{e}}{% dz}.   \\label{b7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in fig.3",
    ", we also find the total entropy inside the event horizon is not always negative . through the relation @xmath64 , we can get @xmath80as a result , @xmath81 does not keep positive all the time . the thermodynamical second law breaks down inside the event horizon .",
    "the hawking temperature , entropy together with the black hole mass follow the thermodynamical first law @xmath26 , and the einstein equation can be derived from the thermodynamical law @xcite . as the thermodynamical laws hold on the event horizon of a stationary black hole , the black hole keeps thermodynamical equilibrium inside it .",
    "the apparent horizon of a black hole is a two - dimensional surface for which the outgoing orthogonal null geodesics have zero divergence @xcite .",
    "a black hole in asymptotically flat space - time is defined as a region so that no casual signal ( i.e. , a signal propagating at a velocity not greater than light ) from light can reach , then the event horizon constitutes the boundary of a black hole . when the weak energy condition is satisfied , the apparent horizon either coincides with event horizon or lies inside it . in stationary black holes ,",
    "the apparent horizon and the event horizon coincide , such as schwarzschild black hole and kerr - newman black hole and so on . there always exists the event horizon located outside the apparent horizon .",
    "when a spherically symmetric black hole becomes non - stationary for some time due to the matter falling into it , the thermodynamical laws are not fit for a non - stationary black hole . when a black hole is non - stationary , the apparent horizon is always not consistent with the event horizon and the thermodynamical laws may not always hold on the event horizon .",
    "the universe is accelerating and should be not stationary . due to the heat through apparent horizon area , we have calculated a variation of the geometrical entropy on the apparent horizon .",
    "we find that the thermodynamical relation is @xmath82 .",
    "in addition , we also examine the changes of the total entropy with the time @xmath83 , therefore , the second law of thermodynamics is evidently confirmed .",
    "while the thermodynamical laws on the event horizon do not hold on , the results are in agreement with the work of wang @xcite .",
    "when the apparent horizon can be regarded as a thermodynamical system which has associated entropy @xmath84 with the temperature @xmath85 , the differential form of the first thermodynamical law on the apparent horizon can be written to the differential form of the friedmann equation @xcite . in a word ,",
    "the apparent horizon is a good boundary of keeping thermodynamical properties , and the universe has a thermal equilibrium inside it .",
    "these properties disappear on the event horizon .",
    "maybe the usual definition of temperature and entropy are not well - defined , or it is non - equilibrium of thermodynamics inside the universe .    in fig.4 , in the low redshift , the changing rate of the apparent horizon and the event horizon is not significant.the thermodynamical description of horizons @xcite will be approximately valid .",
    "the apparent horizon always exists and usually is inside the event horizon . in fig.5 ,",
    "the event horizon is outside apparent horizon at higher redshift phase and the universe is undergoing accelerated expansion .",
    "but in this model the redshift becomes smaller than zero and the equation of state is @xmath86 the universe may have a superacceleratd expanding process and the apparent horizon is outside the event horizon .",
    "this model is similar with the phantom field which will lead to undesirable future singularity and violate the weak energy condition .    in summary",
    ", it is interesting to investigate the universe from the thermodynamical viewpoints , although thermodynamical properties need to be explored more deeply in the future .",
