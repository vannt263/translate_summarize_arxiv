    "a speculative explanation is that the downward magnetic tension forces from the injection regions , which drive downward sound - like waves , are not relatively sufficient because the upward forces by the gas pressure are comparably important in this case ( middle panel of figure [ fig : efx ] ) .",

    "this indicates that the toroidal magnetic fields change the sign before the magnetic fields are amplified to the level as strong as that obtained in the isothermal case .",
