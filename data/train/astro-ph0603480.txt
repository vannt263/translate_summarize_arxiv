    "a large number of m dwarfs have been detected in the last few decades , and our knowlegde of these faint stars has kept improving , but there are still many challenges for research on their magnetic activity .",
    "main - sequence stars are expected to be fully convective if their mass lies below a certain value , about 0.3 - 0.4 @xmath3 ( m3-m4 spectral types ) as suggested by the stellar evolution theory ; this probably shifts toward lower masses due to the influence of the magnetic field @xcite . in fully convective stars , their magnetic field may be produced by dynamo processes @xcite that differ from the shell - dynamo at work in partly - convective sun - like stars .",
    "however the nature of these dynamos is not clear @xcite .",
    "additionally , recent models @xcite disagree with the observations as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "one way to understand the nature of magnetic activity in m dwarfs , especially in fully - convective stars , is to directly measure magnetic fields . in the two last decades , magnetic fields in late type",
    "main sequence stars have been measured for : g , k dwarf stars @xcite or m dwarfs ( * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the basic idea of the measurement method employed by these authors is a comparison of differential zeeman broadening between magnetically sensitive and insensitive spectral lines , through unpolarised high - resolution spectra .",
    "these line broadening measurements have indicated that in some active m dwarfs the stellar surface is covered with magnetic fields of 3 - 4  kg and the filling factor of about 50% ; however they are poorly informative on the field topology .",
    "one should note that an early attempt to search for circular polarisation in m dwarfs was carried out by @xcite but there was no clear detection . in this paper",
    ", we report our analysis of polarised high - resolution spectra of 2 m - dwarf stars : a rapidly rotating m3.5 ( ev  lac ) and a slowly rotating m5.5 ( hh  and ) . based on their spectropolarimetry presented in sec .  2 , we discuss some interesting aspects on the complex field topology in ev  lac and hh  and in sec .  3 .",
    "the star is a fast rotator for an m dwarf : @xmath4  km / s @xcite , with this rotational velocity ev  lac is expected to have a strong magnetic field .",
    "this is therefore a good target to study the dependence of magnetic dynamo on rapidly rotating m stars .",
    "ev  lac is also well - known as an m3.5 flare star ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ; the strong @xmath5 emission observed @xcite indicates a high chromospheric activity level in ev  lac .",
    "the rotational period of the star is about 4 days , derived from its rotational velocity and a corresponding radius of an m3.5 dwarf ( @xmath6 , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite have also well determined a photometric period of 4.4  days for ev  lac .",
    "the mean field measurements using synthetic spectrum fitting have previously been reported : @xmath7 = 4.3 kg , @xmath8% in @xcite ; and @xmath7 = 3.8 kg , @xmath9% in @xcite .",
    "however , no measurements of its longitudinal magnetic field @xmath0 have been reported so far .",
    "the m5.5 dwarf star in contrast with ev  lac is a slow rotator : @xmath10  km / s @xcite .",
    "this is therefore a good target to study the dependence of magnetic dynamo on slowly rotating m stars .",
    "no @xmath5 emission detected @xcite indicates a very low chromospheric activity level in hh  and .",
    "its rotational period is longer than 7 days , derived from an upper limit for @xmath11 as given above and an m5.5 dwarf radius ( @xmath12 , @xcite ) .",
    "there are no measurements of its magnetic field up to now .",
    "the x - ray observations @xcite of nearby stars have implied that the coronal activity level in ev  lac is from 10 to 100 times higher than in hh  and .",
    "we observed ev  lac and hh  and with the espadons / cfht high resolution spectrograph ( @xmath13 ; @xcite ) providing a wavelength coverage of 370 - 1,000  nm , in spectropolarimetric mode to measure stokes @xmath14 and @xmath15 parameters .",
    "for each star we took three successive exposures , 50 minutes of each exposure for ev  lac and 40 minutes for hh  and .",
    "we obtained high signal - to - noise spectra of about 270:1 and 150:1 for ev  lac and hh  and , respectively .",
    "wavelength calibrated unpolarised and polarised spectra corresponding to each observing sequences are extracted with the dedicated software package libre - esprit ( @xcite ; donati et al .",
    ", in preparation ) following the principles of optimal extraction @xcite .    to compute the mean longitudinal magnetic field of the stars from the photospheric lines , we use the least - squares deconvolution ( lsd ) multi - line analysis procedure of about 1.2 are used simultaneously to retrieve the average polarisation information in line profiles , with typical noise levels of @xmath160.06% ( relative to the unpolarised continuum level ) per 1.8  km / s velocity bin and per individual polarisation spectrum , corresponding to a multiplex gain in s / n of about 10 with respect to a single average line analysis .",
    "] given in @xcite , producing mean stokes @xmath14 ( unpolarised ) and @xmath15 ( circularly polarised ) profiles for all collected spectra .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show our mean stokes @xmath15 profiles of ev  lac and hh  and . in the case of ev  lac , mean",
    "longitudinal field strengths corresponding to three successive exposures are : @xmath0 = 18@xmath13  g , @xmath240@xmath13  g and @xmath237@xmath13  g , respectively .",
    "it is very interesting to note that using the formula given in @xcite the mean longitudinal field strengths estimated from the chromospheric lines are much stronger than from the photospheric lines ; and they are different between the balmer lines ( @xmath17  g ) and the ca  ii infra - red triplet ( irt ) ( @xmath18  g , an average over the three triplet lines ) .",
    "we defer a discussion of this result to sec .",
    "3 .    for hh  and , its stokes @xmath15 profiles from our observations have not revealed a significant magnetic field , @xmath19  g. we have therefore set up an upper limit of 5  g on @xmath0 for the star .",
    "in this paper , we could not detect the circularly polarised signature in hh  and but we did detect it in ev  lac . the explanation might be a difference in the kind of magnetic dynamo that dominates in each star . since ev  lac ( m3.5 ) and hh  and ( m5.5 ) have low enough masses , @xmath20 for ev  lac and @xmath21 for hh  and @xcite , and they are therefore expected to be fully convective @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , a turbulent dynamo @xcite may dominate in hh  and and generates a small - scale structure that is not accessible to us . in the case of ev  lac , the magnetic field",
    "is probably generated from both a turbulent dynamo and another dynamo kind .",
    "the latter may only work in rapidly rotating stars and produces a large - scale structure whose magnetic fields are able to be detected , e.g. ev  lac ( this paper ) or v374  peg @xcite .    figures 3 - 6 show the stokes @xmath15 and @xmath14 profiles of the h@xmath22 at 656.28  nm , and the ca  ii  irt ( at 849.802 , 854.209 , and 866.214  nm ) respectively for the last exposure .",
    "the difference in the stokes @xmath15 profile between the h@xmath22 and the ca  ii  irt reflects : ( 1 ) an imhomogeneous and complex field topology in ev  lac ; ( 2 ) the different shapes of the emission cores ( @xmath23 ) ; ( 3 ) the difference in the effective land factor and the @xmath24 component distribution of the lines ; ( 4 ) the difference in line formation heights of the h@xmath22 and the ca  ii  irt , and the field strengths at those heights @xcite .    during our observation ,",
    "the balmer lines as well as the emission cores of the ca  ii  irt in ev  lac indicate chromospheric ( and therefore magnetic ) activity .",
    "this supports the idea that the zeeman signatures of the balmer lines and the ca  ii  irt have a chromospheric origin . on the other hand , the longitudinal magnetic field strength computed from the balmer lines ( @xmath25  g ) is much stronger than that from the ca  ii  irt ( @xmath26  g ) , implying that the zeeman signatures of the balmer lines and the ca  ii  irt might be formed at different heights @xcite .",
    "our observations have also indicated a significant variability of the field in ev  lac : an opposite sign of @xmath0 observed in the first exposure compared with the second and the third one .",
    "the time scale of this variability is very short , i.e. less than 50 minutes .",
    "we consider several possibilities that could explain the variability .",
    "first , the possibility of star rotation changing the field vector is ruled out since in the case of ev  lac its rotational period of 4 days could not significantly change the field vector in 50 minutes or @xmath270.8% of a whole phase .",
    "second , the possibility of a strong flare during our observations , modifying the zeeman signature obtained in the first exposure , is also precluded since we do not find any significant change in the h@xmath22 profile whose equivalent width is of about 3.3    for all three exposures .",
    "finally , with high probability the magnetic field in ev  lac is intrinsically variable .",
    "this again indicates the imhomogeneous and complex field in the star that probably leads observational results as discussed above .    more spectropolarimetric observations at different rotational phases will allow us to reconstruct the ev  lac field topology not only on the stellar surface but also in three dimensions by using different lines coming from different layers of the star",
    "this will lead to a strong improvement of our understanding on magnetic field in ev  lac and hence in low mass stars .",
    "we thank the referee for many helpful comments that clarified and significantly improved our paper . p.b.n .",
    "acknowledges useful discussions with j. valenti and g. chabrier .",
