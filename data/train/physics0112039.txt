    "the regulation of gene expression involves many different proteins known as transcription factors which bind passively to specific sites on the genomic dna ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . in bacteria ,",
    "each such site ( called ` operator ' ) typically consists of a contiguous sequence of @xmath0 nucleotides which binds a specific transcription factor with much higher affinity than would a random dna sequence of comparable length @xcite .",
    "known examples of different operators for the same factor usually differ from the maximum affinity binding sequence in a number of positions , typically in as many as @xmath1 to @xmath2 of the significant positions that contribute most to the specificity of the interaction .",
    "the ensemble of viable binding sequences is collectively referred to as the binding `` motif '' for a factor ; its `` fuzziness '' creates a difficult computational problem for the prediction of binding sites via informatic methods ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; and references therein ) . in many known cases , a _ single _ regulatory region contains _ multiple _",
    "operators for the same factor , each of which deviates from the maximum affinity binding sequence .    why are the motifs fuzzy ?",
    "one possible scenario is that the binding affinity of each operator is tuned evolutionarily to maximize the function of each regulated gene or operon .",
    "an alternative scenario is that the function is insensitive to the detail of the binding affinity as long as it is above some threshold . in the former case , fuzziness in the binding arises due to the particular distribution of functional requirment . in the latter case ,",
    "binding sequences in different regulatory regions are deemed `` equal '' , and fuzziness results from maximizing the sequence `` entropy '' . while anecdotal examples of both cases are known ,",
    "understanding whether either case dominates in biology is of interest not only for its own sake , but also very important for the choice of proper informatics tools for motif finding . in this paper , we describe a detailed theoretical study of the latter case from an evolutionary perspective , recognizing that as with any other portion of the genome , the binding sequences are subject to the opposing forces of mutation and selection over evolutionary timescales . in particular , we address the quantitative question of how large a selective advantage the presence of a binding motif needs to provide , in order to guarantee its survival against mutations , and how large an advantage before multiple motifs are justified . to make the study concrete and explicit",
    ", we will mostly confine the discussion to gene regulation in bacteria or phages , and focus on the binding of one specific transcription factor to its operator(s ) in the regulatory region of one specific gene or operon .",
    "we will not treat the interactions among different factors , since in bacteria such as _",
    "e.  coli _ , the majority of genes are regulated by a single factor  @xcite .",
    "another motivation for our study is that the evolution of transcription factor binding motifs seems to be a well - suited starting point for an attempt to establish a link between the microscopic molecular mechanisms in the cell and the `` macroscopic '' principles of evolution : in general , the most important ingredient in an evolutionary study is to relate the genotype on which mutation acts to the fitness of the organism on which selection acts through some quantifiable phenotype .",
    "this relation is particularly simple for the operator binding problem at hand , where a natural choice of the phenotype is the binding probability of the transcription factor to the operator .",
    "regardless of whether the factor acts as an activator by attracting a polymerase to transcribe the gene , or as a repressor to block transcription , it can function only when it is bound to its operator .",
    "the fraction of time an operator is occupied in equilibrium is given by the binding probability . to regulate the transcription of the gene , e.g. , in reaction to a change in the environmental conditions or in order to trigger a different phase of the cell cycle",
    ", the cell changes the factor - operator binding probability by varying the concentration of the ( activated ) factor inside the cell .",
    "the concentration may vary from practically zero in the `` off - state '' to typically several hundred copies per cell in the `` on - state '' .",
    "we will make the reasonable ( but critical ) assumption that the fitness gain an operator contributes to the organism depends solely on the binding probability @xmath3 in the on - state , with the value of @xmath3 itself determined by the actual sequence of the operator through the binding energetics .",
    "for a few exemplary transcription factors , the variation in binding affinity upon mutation of the binding sequence has been studied in great detail experimentally  @xcite . in particular , fields , stormo , and coworkers",
    "have shown for the case of the mnt repressor that its binding ( free ) energy is approximately a sum over _ independent _ contributions from each of the nucleotide positions in the binding sequence  @xcite .",
    "typically , only @xmath4 positions in a binding site have a strong preference for specific nucleotides , while the other positions do not contribute significantly to the binding energy .",
    "known binding sequences display a fuzziness of up to @xmath5 mismatches in these significant positions . a useful simplified ` two - state model ' for transcription factor binding",
    "is obtained by taking only the significant bases into account and assigning to each of them the same binding energy @xmath6 , i.e. a match ( to the optimal binding sequence ) is favored by an energy difference @xmath6 over a mismatch .",
    "this model , introduced long ago by @xcite , takes into account the effect of sequence - specific binding by a single parameter @xmath6 , without reference to detailed binding energies which have not yet been measured for most transcription factors .",
    "based on the two - state model and our assumption on the contribution of the binding of the factor towards fitness , we construct an explicit theory for the evolution of the binding sequences . within the mean - field approach originally proposed by eigen in the context of quasispecies evolution  @xcite",
    ", we characterize the balance between the opposing forces of selection and mutation quantitatively .",
    "we determine the critical selection pressure needed to keep a motif from mutating away , and show how the fuzziness in the motifs arises naturally above the selection threshold .",
    "we further apply the theory to investigate the frequently observed occurrence of multiple motifs in a given regulatory region , and elaborate on various plausible causes . towards the end",
    ", we will provide extended discussions on experimental approaches to pursue the open questions suggested by this study .",
    "we focus on the operator sequence located in the regulatory region of a gene of interest . by assumption ,",
    "this gene is regulated by a single transcription factor .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the @xmath8 significant nucleotides of the operator which specify transcription factor binding .",
    "we will keep the alphabet size , @xmath9 , as a variable in our equations , since , as we will see below , this facilitates the intuitive understanding of certain dependencies ; however @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the only case of interest here . to describe the evolution of @xmath12 in a population of bacteria or phages , we need to specify the action of selection and mutation .",
    "* selection mechanism *    it should be clear that gene regulation is only needed in the presence of a _ changing _ cellular state , triggered either internally , e.g. cell cycle , or externally through a change in the environment .",
    "hence to study the fitness of a regulatory mechanism , we must invoke at least two different states .",
    "selection arises when the growth rate of an organism depends on the probability @xmath13 that the factor binds to the sequence @xmath12 in the state that prefers factor binding ( the `` on - state '' ) . for",
    "the sake of concreteness , let us consider an environment that oscillates between two states .",
    "we assume that in state a ( the on - state ) , the environment induces a certain concentration of activated factors , say on average @xmath14 factors per cell ( these may either be produced upon entering state a , or preexisting factors may be activated for binding by inducers that cause an allosteric transition ) .",
    "let the growth rate or `` fitness '' of the organism in this state be @xmath15 if the factor is never bound ( binding motif not present ) , and @xmath16 if the factor is always bound ( see table 1 ) .",
    "when the environment is in state b ( the off - state ) , let the fitness be @xmath17 if the factor is never bound and @xmath18 if the factor is always bound .",
    "in the following we will assume that the concentration of activated factors in state b is practically zero , so that the operator is never occupied ( hence the parameter @xmath19 does not enter our model ) .",
    "an example for the general situation described above could be the binding of the _ lac_-repressor to its operator in the _ lac_-operon of _ e. coli_. in this case , the on - state would be the glucose - rich environment , and the off - state would be the glucose - poor and lactose - rich environment",

    "@xmath21 would be the increment in fitness when the unnecessary _ lac_-operon is turned off , and @xmath22 is the deleterious situation when lactose is present as the main source of sugar but the _ lac_-operon is not operative due to the undesirable binding of the repressor .",
    ".fitness of the organism in two different cellular states , with or without the binding of the transcription factor . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this study , we will discuss mainly the time - averaged effect over evolutionary time scales , which are much larger than the time scales of cellular or environmental fluctuations .",
    "we choose @xmath23 as our unit of time , with @xmath24 denoting the average generation time in the absence of the factor , so that the time averaged growth rate there can be set to 1 .",

    "furthermore , we neglect the difference between transversions and transitions , and assume a constant rate @xmath32 at which a base mutates into any other base . the total mutation rate of a site of length @xmath8 is then @xmath33 . for bacteria such as _ e. coli _",

    "instead , sequencing the same binding sites in several different strains should yield the desired data . besides allowing a comparison to our model , detailed information on polymorphisms in binding sequences would also make it possible to address a number of interesting questions , e.g. how does the selection pressure on binding sites compare with the selection pressure on coding sequences ? or , can one identify compensating mutations between promoter and binding site sequences , e.g. could a mutation that weakens the promoter be compensated by a mutation that increases the affinity of an activator to its operator site ?",
    "we conclude that the evolution of transcription factor binding sites is a problem that is well suited to establishing a link between the detailed molecular biophysics of a system and its evolutionary dynamics .",
    "the theory presented in the present article is meant as a first step , with the hope of stimulating future experiments in this direction .",
    "there are many directions for the improvement of the model and the analysis .",
    "one important question is the validity of the mean - field analysis described here .",
    "is the finite population size effect important here and how would it change the motif statistics within our model ?",
    "one can also investigate more elaborate models including , for instance , the effect of time - dependent environment , the coupled evolution of the polymerase and transcription factor the binding sites , and the interaction among different factors .",

    "<S> the model is confined to the mean field ( i.e. , infinite population size ) limit . using realistic values for all parameters , we determine the minimum fitness advantage needed to maintain a binding sequence , demonstrating explicitly the `` error threshold '' below which a binding sequence can not survive the accumulated effect of mutation over long time . </S>",
    "<S> the commonly observed `` fuzziness '' in binding motifs arises naturally as a consequence of the balance between selection and mutation in our model . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we devise a simple model for the evolution of multiple binding sequences in a given regulatory region . </S>",
    "<S> we find the number of evolutionarily stable binding sequences to increase in a step - like fashion with increasing fitness advantage , if multiple regulatory proteins can synergistically enhance gene transcription . </S>",
