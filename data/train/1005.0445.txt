    "the human bronchial tree can be seen as a set of dyadically connected pipes , which sums up to 23 bifurcation levels from the trachea to terminal branches , on which gas exchanges occur .",
    "thanks to poiseuille s law for a pipe , which states a proportionalty relation between air flow rate and pressure jump , it behaves as a fluid conductor like a resistive network , where pressure at bifurcating nodes plays the role of the electric potential , and air flow the role of electric intensity .",
    "schematically , air is driven to the alveoli ( zone of gas exchange with the blood ) by a negative pressure maintained on the outlets during inspiration .",
    "in the situation where pressure is a constant @xmath1 and the tree is regular ( i.e. resistances are the same for all pipes of a given generation ) , the overall process follows a generalized poiseuille law ( fluid counterpart of ohm s law ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the global resistance . yet , as soon as pressures are not uniform , or if the tree is no longer regular ( which can happen for example during an asthma crisis ) , this scalar ohmic law has be to extended . for the idealized tree with @xmath4 outlets , this law takes the form of a linear ( if atmospheric pressure is set at @xmath5 ) relation between a collection of @xmath4 values for the pressure , and a vector of fluxes .",
    "the corresponding matrix @xmath3 can be written explicitly as a function of the resistances ( see  @xcite ) .    in a recent paper  @xcite , a model of the respiratory system as an infinite tree was proposed .",
    "this extrapolation of the finite resistive tree to an infinite one is natural because the actual bronchial tree exhibits some geometric regularity .",
    "indeed , it is shown in  @xcite that dimensions of the pipes ( at least in the conducting , central part of the tree , i.e. between generations 6 and 17 ) progress in a geometric way , with a reduction factor @xmath6 close to @xmath7 . as the poiseuille resistance of a pipe scales like @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the length and @xmath10 the radius ) , resistance at generation @xmath11 scales like @xmath12 , with @xmath13 . for the extrapolated infinite tree ,",
    "as generation @xmath11 contains @xmath14 resistances in parallel , one obtains a finite global resistance @xmath15 and this finiteness is stable under small perturbations of the geometry .",
    "next step consists in replacing the collection of discrete pressures at the end of the actual tree by a `` continuous '' field ( a function defined over the uncountable set of ends ) .",
    "a first way to identify the corresponding trace space is immediate .",
    "denoting by @xmath16 the set of vertices of tree @xmath17 , @xmath18 the pressure at vertex @xmath19 , writing @xmath20 for connected vertices and @xmath21 the resistance of the corresponding edge , sobolev space @xmath22 over @xmath17 is defined as all those pressure fields such that @xmath23 note that the previous definition makes sense for any kind of network with bounded connectivity  : the quantity above simply represents the instantaneous rate of dissipated energy by viscous effects . denoting by @xmath24",
    "the closure of finitely supported fields , a first expression of the trace space is the quotient @xmath25 . as detailed in  @xcite ( in a probabilistic framework ) , non triviality of this space , which is equivalent to @xmath26 , indicates that `` something happens '' at infinity , i.e. it does make sense to prescribe certain pressure fields at infinity to drive some fluid through the tree .    in order to obtain a more explicit description of the space of trace functions ( pressure fields on the set of ends ) , an explicit construction of a hilbert basis of harmonic , finite energy functions",
    "is proposed in  @xcite .",
    "such functions are in some sense piecewise constant at infinity , so that their trace can be defined canonically .",
    "general trace theorems then follow in a standard way by density .    following a suggestion by p. colmez",
    ", we propose here an alternative approach , based on the identification of the boundary of the tree ( set of ends ) to the ring of 2-adic integers @xmath27 , and a different strategy to define traces . to any pressure field",
    "@xmath28 defined over the tree , we shall consider its restriction @xmath29 to the @xmath11-th generation , consider the corresponding function @xmath30 in the schwartz space of @xmath0 ( constant over each bunch of leafs stemming from any of the @xmath11-th generation vertices ) , and show that this sequence converges in @xmath31 , and possibly in a stronger way under some condition on the resistance growth .",
    "regularity of the corresponding trace function will be expressed in terms of behaviour near infinity of the fourier transform ( sobolev - like regularity ) .",
    "the approach presented here may seem excessively and artificially abstract considering the actual object it aims at reproducing in some way .",
    "indeed , we are aware that some parts of what we present can be ( and actually have been in some cases ) presented in a different and less abstract setting , in particular    1 .",
    "regularity of the trace functions ; 2 .",
    "expression of the neuman - dirichlet operator , which maps flow fields onto pressure fields .    concerning @xmath32 , functions over the set of ends of the tree can be described in terms of @xmath33 regularity , as presented in  @xcite , without any reference to 2-adic integers .",
    "yet , as we will see , the @xmath27 approach allows a very natural and concise way to define sobolev spaces in the fourier setting , which enlights the deep similarities with trace operators in the partial differential equations context .",
    "as for the neuman dirichlet operator , it can be represented by matrices for finite tree ( see  @xcite ) , and by kernel operators for infinite tree ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "we will present here how the @xmath27 approach makes it possible to express them as a convolution by a riesz kernel with a exponent directly related to the geometric growth of resistances .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : ident ] , we present the identification between the set of ends of a dyadic tree and @xmath0 , and we give a first trace theorem based on this identification . in section  [ sec : sob ] we give some regularity properties of trace functions ( sobolev regularity ) .",
    "section  [ sec : dn ] is dedicated to dirichlet- neuman and neuman - dirichlet operators , and in section  [ sec : embed ] we investigate the possibility to imbed the end of the infinite tree onto a domain of @xmath34 ( actual domain occupied by a real lung ) .",
    "finaly we gather in the appendices some facts on fourier analysis and sobolev spaces on @xmath27 .    in what follows the ideal dyadic infinite geometric tree , with resistances following a geometric growth in @xmath12 ( with @xmath35 close to @xmath36 for a healthy lung , as stated before ) will play a central role . yet , we shall present results with maximal generality , allowing when it is possible non - regular trees ( non - uniform resistances within a generation ) .",
