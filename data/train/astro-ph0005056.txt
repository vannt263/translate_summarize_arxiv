    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars provide keys to our understanding of massive stellar evolution , nucleosynthesis processes and chemical enrichment of the ism . of these , the oxygen - sequence ( wo ) introduced by barlow & hummer ( 1982 ) is by far the rarest .",
    "their high excitation oxygen emission lines are widely interpreted as revealing the late core helium - burning or possibly carbon - burning stage ( smith & maeder 1991 ) , of importance for constraining the controversial @xmath8c(@xmath9o reaction rate .    in spite of searches in all local group galaxies , only six massive",
    "wo stars are known to date , namely sand  1 ( sk188 ) in the smc , sand  2 ( bat99123 ) in the lmc , sand 4 ( wr102 ) , sand 5 ( wr142 ) and ms4 ( wr30a ) in our galaxy , and dr1 in ic1613 . since ovi 381134  is a primary wo classification diagnostic , with an equivalent width of up to 1700   ( kingsburgh , barlow & storey ( 1995 , hereafter kbs ) , observations of ovi 103238  are keenly sought .",
    "however , its location in the far - uv has ruled out such observations to date .",
    "this situation has changed following the successful launch of the _ far - ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse _ , moos et al .",
    "2000 ) , which permits routine high dispersion far - uv spectroscopy of massive stars in the magellanic clouds .    in this letter , we analyse _ fuse _ spectroscopy of sand  2 ( sanduleak 1971 ) , alias sk@xmath1068@xmath11 145 = brey  93 = bat99 - 123 ( breysacher , azzopardi & testor 1999 ) , together with",
    "_ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ and ground - based datasets .",
    "previously unpublished far - uv , uv and optical / near - ir spectroscopy of sand  2 have been obtained with _ fuse _ , _ hst _ and the mt stromlo and siding spring observatory ( mssso ) 2.3 m , respectively .",
    "sand  2 was observed by _ fuse _ as part of the early release observation programme x018 on 1999 oct 31 .",
    "a 8134 sec exposure of sand  2 with the @xmath12 ( lwrs ) aperture provided data at @xmath1312,000 with the two lithium fluoride ( lif ) channels , covering @xmath149791187 , obtained in time - tag ( ttag ) mode . at this epoch , the two silicon carbide ( sic ) channels , covering @xmath149051104 , were badly aligned so that sic data were of poor quality .",
    "sand  2 data were processed through the pipeline data reduction , calfuse ( version 1.6.8 ) , and are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the pipeline extracted the 1d spectrum , removed the background , and corrected for grating wobble and detector drifts .",
    "no corrections for astigmatism or flat fielding have been applied . from fig .  1",
    ", the far - uv continuum flux of sand  2 is low ( @xmath15 ergs@xmath2@xmath16@xmath2 ) , with two principal stellar features , ovi @xmath171032 - 38 and civ @xmath171168 .",
    "the latter is blended with ciii @xmath171175 , while civ @xmath171108 and ovi @xmath171125 are present , though weak . the _ fuse _ spectrum is affected by a multitude of interstellar absorption features , principally hi and h@xmath18 , plus airglow emission features due to ly@xmath19 , [ oi ] and [ ni ] .      sand  2 was observed with the _ hst _ faint object spectrograph ( fos ) instrument during 1996 march ( pi : d.j .",
    "hillier , program i d 5460 ) .",
    "exposures totalling 5980 , 3780 and 1090 sec were obtained with the g130h , g190h and g270h gratings , respectively .",
    "many important spectral features are identified in the _",
    "hst_/fos dataset ( see also kbs ) , principally civ @xmath171550 , ciii @xmath172297 , heii @xmath171640 , oiv @xmath171340 , ov @xmath171371 , @xmath17278187 .",
    "following prinja , barlow & howarth ( 1990 ) we find @xmath1=4100 kms@xmath2 from civ @xmath17154851 ( kbs derived 4500 kms@xmath2 from _ iue _ spectroscopy ) .",
    "we have used the double beam spectrograph ( dbs ) at the 2.3 m mssso telescope to observe sand  2 on 1997 dec 2427 .",
    "use of a dichroic and the 300b , 600b and 316r gratings permitted simultaneous spectroscopy covering 36206085  and 64108770  for 1200sec , plus 32404480   and 864011010   for 2500sec . a 2@xmath20 slit and 1752@xmath21532 pixel site",
    "ccd s provided a 2 pixel spectral resolution of @xmath225 .",
    "a standard data reduction was carried out , including absolute flux calibration , using wide slit spectrophotometry of hd60753 ( b3iv ) and @xmath23 col ( o9v ) , plus atmospheric correction using hr2221 ( b8v ) .",
    "convolving our dataset with johnson broad - band filter profiles reveals v=15.1 and b - v=+0.54 mag .",
    "since these are contaminated by emission lines , we have convolved our data with smith @xmath24 narrow - band filters to reveal @xmath25=16.1 , @xmath260.19 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 mag .",
    "our optical dataset confirms the spectral morphology previously presented and discussed by kbs , with exceptionally strong oiv @xmath173400 , oiv @xmath173818 , civ+heii @xmath174660 and civ @xmath175801 .",
    "depending on the wo selection criteria , its spectral type is wo3 ( crowther , de marco & barlow 1998 ) or wo4 ( kbs ) .",
    "wolf - rayet winds are so dense that non - lte effects , spherical geometry and an expanding atmosphere are minimum assumptions .",
    "we employ the code of hillier & miller ( 1998 ) , cmfgen , which iteratively solves the transfer equation in the co - moving frame subject to statistical and radiative equilibrium in an expanding , spherically symmetric and steady - state atmosphere .",
    "these models account for clumping , via a volume filling factor , @xmath29 , and line blanketing , both of which have a significant effect on the physical properties of wc stars ( e.g. hillier & miller 1999 ) . through the use of ` super - levels '",
    ", extremely complex atoms can be included .",
    "for the present application , a total of 3,552 levels ( combined into 796 super - levels ) , 60 depth points and 63,622 spectral lines of hei - ii , cii - iv , oii - vi , neii - iv , siiv , siv - vi , ariii - v , and feiv - viii are considered simultaneously ( see dessart et al . 2000 for the source of atomic data used ) .",
    "we adopt a form for the velocity law ( eqn  8 from hillier & miller 1999 ) such that two exponents are considered ( @xmath30=1 , @xmath31=50 , @xmath32=2900 kms@xmath2 , @xmath33=100 kms@xmath2 ) , with the result that acceleration is modest at small radii , but continues to large distance ( 0.9@xmath1 is reached at 100@xmath34 ) .",
    "our spectroscopic analysis derives @xmath35 , rather than @xmath36 and @xmath29 individually , since line blending is severe in sand  2 .",
    "a series of models were calculated in which stellar parameters , @xmath37 , log@xmath38 , @xmath35 , c / he and o / he , were adjusted until the observed line strengths and spectroscopic fluxes were reproduced .",
    "we adopt 0.4@xmath39 abundances for ne , si , s , ar and fe . the distance to the lmc",
    "was assumed to be 51.2kpc ( panagia et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "the wind ionization balance is ideally deduced using isolated spectral lines from adjacent ionization stages of carbon ( ciii @xmath172297 , civ @xmath175801 - 12 ) or oxygen ( oiv @xmath173404 - 14 , ov @xmath173144 , ovi @xmath175290 ) . in practice",
    "this was difficult to achieve for sand  2 because of the severe line blending .",
    "our initial parameter study of sand  2 revealed a fairly similar spectral appearance spanning 120kk@xmath40170kk , with log@xmath38=5.28 and log(@xmath41yr@xmath424.94 fixed .",
    "the principal differences between these models are that ( i ) the observed strength of the ovi 381134  doublet , plus lines in the red such as civ 7700  favour a high @xmath37 ; ( ii ) the weakness of the ovi 103238  doublet , as revealed by _ fuse _ , favours a lower @xmath37",
    ". since other parameters , in particular abundances , are largely unaffected by these discrepancies , we shall adopt @xmath37=150kk ( i.e. @xmath34=0.65@xmath43 ) .",
    "note that higher luminosity models do produce significant effects , such as a dramatic weakening of civ 580112  emission .",
    "fig .  2 compares our synthetic spectrum with the observed far - uv , uv and optical spectroscopy of sand  2 .",
    "our model is reddened by @xmath44=0.08 mag due to our galaxy , obtained from the reddening map of burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) .",
    "an additional lmc component of 0.11 mag was required , such that @xmath45mag . in the absence of a far - uv extinction law ,",
    "standard uv laws ( seaton 1979 ; howarth 1983 ) are _ extrapolated _ for @xmath461200with ( variable ) influence on the fit quality to _ fuse _ data .",
    "overall the observed spectrum of sand  2 is very well reproduced by the model , with most heii , ciii - iv and oiv - vi lines matched in strength and shape , except for ovi @xmath14381134 ( model too weak ) and ovi @xmath1410321038 ( model too strong ) as discussed above . in particular , the flat - topped nature of ciii @xmath172297 is well matched .",
    "it is clear that although wo stars have little or no ciii @xmath175696 ( a classification diagnostic ) , other ciii lines are indeed present ( hillier 1989 ) .",
    "many spectral features in sand  2 are due to blends because of the very broad spectral lines and the fact that recombination lines of ovi and civ overlap with heii lines . for example , the spectral feature at @xmath1446504686 has principal contributors heii @xmath174686 , ciii @xmath144647 - 50 , civ @xmath174658 and civ @xmath174685 , while minor contributors include civ @xmath174646 , @xmath174689 and ovi @xmath174678 .",
    "heii @xmath175412/civ @xmath175471 provides an excellent diagnostic of c / he ( e.g. hillier & miller 1998 ) for spectroscopic studies of wc stars .",
    "however , the large line widths of wo stars , and the fact that civ @xmath175412 ( 148 ) contributes to heii @xmath175412 ( 74 ) hinders the use of these lines ( see inset box in fig .  2 ) . instead , we are able to derive c / he@xmath470.2 by number from heii ( 64 ) @xmath176560/civ @xmath177700 , although civ ( 128 ) contributes to the former .",
    "other civ and heii recombination lines show excellent agreement , except that civ @xmath171107 is predicted to be stronger than _ fuse _ observations reveal .",
    "in contrast to wc stars , numerous oxygen recombination lines are present in the uv and optical spectra of wo stars ( e.g. ovi @xmath175290 , @xmath172070 ) . from their strength relative to he and c recombination lines , we estimate o / he@xmath6 by number . the weakness of lower ionization oxygen features , such as oiv @xmath171400 and ov @xmath173150 also argue against higher o / he ratios , although ov @xmath175590 favours o / he@xmath220.25 .",
    "poor fits to ovi @xmath14103238 and @xmath14381134 are discussed above , while ov @xmath14278187 and oiv @xmath14306371 are systematically too weak for all models .",
    "we present the predicted temperature structure of our sand  2 model in fig .",
    "although sand  2 is an extremely hot star , its very high content of efficient c and o coolants ( see hillier 1989 ) directly results in a very cool ( @xmath4810kk ) outer wind ( @xmath49 100 ) .",
    "consequently , the ionization structure of metal species is predicted to be very stratified , such that o@xmath50 is the dominant ionization stage for @xmath515 , yet o@xmath52 is dominant for @xmath4925 .",
    "the high stellar temperature of sand  2 implies a high bolometric correction ( @xmath105.7 mag ) and consequently hard ionizing spectrum , such that 50% of the emergent photons have energies greater than 13.6ev ( 912  lyman edge ) , and 30% greater than 24.6ev ( 504hei edge ) .",
    "the ionizing fluxes in the hi , hei , and heii continua are 10@xmath53 s@xmath2 , 10@xmath54 s@xmath2 and 10@xmath55 s@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "wo stars are known to produce strong nebular heii @xmath174686 emission in associated hii regions ( e.g. kingsburgh & barlow 1995 ) , although the predicted number of heii continuum ionizing photons in our sand  2 model is much lower than those inferred from other wo stars .",
    "abundances derived here qualitatively support the results from kbs , who used recombination line theory to derive c / he=0.5 and o / he=0.1 for sand  2 .",
    "wo stars are well suited to recombination studies for carbon , although oxygen is somewhat more problematic for recombination line studies , since the ionization structure is more complex ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , and few lines have available coefficients .",
    "grfener , hamann & koesterke ( 1999 ) have carried out a detailed non - lte spectroscopic analysis of sand  2 ( see grfener et al . 1998 ) .",
    "overall , we confirm their @xmath35 determination , but derive a higher luminosity ( by 0.2dex ) and temperature ( they derived @xmath37=101kk ) , attributable to the incorporation of line blanketing .",
    "more significantly , we obtain systematically lower metal abundances ( they estimated c / he=1.3 and o / he=1.2 ) , such that the oxygen mass fraction for sand  2 is only 16% , versus 50% according to grfener et al . ( 1999 ) .",
    "we attribute this major revision to improved spectroscopic and atomic datasets ( grfener et al . used simple c and o model atoms plus low s / n optical data ) .",
    "our higher luminosity and clumpy wind conspire to revise the wind performance ratio , @xmath56 , from 56 to 12 .",
    "4 compares the luminosities and ( c+o)/he ratios for sand  2 with six lmc wc4 stars , updated from dessart ( 1999 ) .",
    "he improved upon similar work by grfener et al .",
    "( 1998 ) using line blanketed , clumped models , revealing a greater range of carbon abundances , 0.1@xmath57c / he@xmath570.3 ( due to improved spectroscopy ) , systematically higher luminosities ( because of blanketing and improved reddenings ) , and lower mass - loss rates ( due to clumping ) .",
    "the carbon enrichment of sand  2 is substantially higher than the wc4 stars , although o / he does not differ so greatly from the wc4 sample , for which o / he@xmath570.08 .",
    "this supports the suggestion by crowther ( 1999 ) that unusually high oxygen enrichment may not be a pre - requisite for a wo classification .",
    "we have superimposed ( non - rotating ) evolutionary tracks from meynet et al .",
    "( 1994 ) at 0.4@xmath39 for @xmath58=60 , 85 and 120@xmath59 on fig .  4 .",
    "these evolutionary models predict c / o@xmath222 when c / he@xmath220.7 , in conflict with our determination of c / o@xmath224 .",
    "better agreement is expected for evolutionary models in which rotation is accounted for , since these predict higher c / o ratios during the wc / wo phase ( maeder & meynet 2000 ) . from interior models ,",
    "@xmath60 for sand  2 , with a corresponding age of @xmath2234.3myr , such that a supernova is expected within the next 0.15@xmath7 years .",
    "the stellar luminosity implies a current mass of 10@xmath59 ( schaerer & maeder 1992 ) , such that the _ mean _ post - main sequence mass - loss rate is 2.55@xmath61 @xmath59yr@xmath2 .    quantitative analysis of other wo stars suffer from either ( i ) high interstellar reddening ( wr102 , wr142 ) , ( ii ) complications because of binarity ( sand  1 ) , or ( iii ) large distances ( dr1 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we expect similar c and o enrichment to that derived here for sand  2 ( kbs ) .",
    "this work is based on data obtained : ( i ) for the guaranteed time team by the nasa - cnes - csa fuse mission , operated by the johns hopkins university , ( ii ) with the nasa / esa hubble space telescope obtained from the data archive at the stsci , which is operated by aura under the nasa contract nas5 - 26555 ; ( iii ) with the 2.3 m mount stromlo and siding spring observatory .",
