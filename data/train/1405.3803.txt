    "the neutron star in the binary system has a wide orbit around a be type star with an orbital period of @xmath3 days and an eccentricity of @xmath4 ( delgado - marti et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the binary orbit of the system is wide and rather circular , such that the x - ray pulsar does not pass through the equatorial disc of the be star .",
    "therefore , x per does not exhibit type - i outbursts near periastron passages , despite the fact that such outbursts are typical of most be x - ray binary systems .",
    "taking into account the observed x - ray luminosities ( @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 ) of the system , delgado - marti et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggested that accreting matter is supplied by a slow ( @xmath7 150 km s@xmath6 ) and dense wind possibly originating from the equatorial disc around the companion star .",
    "long term pulse period variation of the source has been monitored since 1970s using observations of various x - ray observatories ( nagase 1989 ; lutovinov et al .",

    "the source was in a long - term spin - down episode with a rate of @xmath10 yr@xmath9 .",
    "after 2002 , it was found that the spin rate changed sign again as the source was found to spin up with a rate of @xmath11 yr@xmath9 which is significantly higher in magnitude compared to that of the previous spin - up episode before 1978 .    in this paper , we present results of the timing analysis of _ rxte_-pca and _ integral_-isgri observations of x per . in section [ obssec ] ,",

    "pca ( proportional counter array ) onboard _ rxte _ ( _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ) had five identical co - aligned proportional counter units ( pcus ) ( jahoda et al .",
    "1996 , 2006 ) .",
    "each pcu had an effective area of approximately 1300 @xmath12 .",
    "the pca was able to detect photons having energies between 2 and 60 kev , with a spectral resolution of 18 per cent at 6 kev and a field of view ( fov ) at full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath13 . the number of active pcus during the observations of x per varied between one and three .",
    "data from all the available pcus are used in this analysis and count rates shown in figure [ lcurve ] are the values corrected as if 5 pcus were operational .",
    "x per was observed by _",
    "rxte _ between 1 july 1998 and 17 february 2003 .",
    "the exposures of the individual pointed observations vary between 2 ks and 15 ks .",
    "the total exposure of 148 pointings adds up to @xmath14ks ( see table [ rxtelist ] for details ) .",
    "we extract light curves of the source with 0.1s time binning in 3 @xmath15 20 kev energy band using ` goodxenon ` mode events from pca .    `",
    "heasoft ` v.6.13 software is used for the pca data analysis . only the data corresponding to times",
    "when the elevation angle is greater than 10@xmath16 , the offset from the source is less than 0.02@xmath16 and the electron contamination of pcu2 is less than 0.1 are analysed .",
    "the latest background estimator models supplied by the _ rxte _ guest observer facility are used to extract background spectra and light curves .",
    "these background subtracted light curves are corrected to the barycenter of the solar system as well as for binary motion using the orbital parameters of x per ( see table 2 in delgado - marti et al .",
    ".    ._rxte_-pca observation list [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      we investigate the pulsed fraction variation of x per for all the available _ rxte_-pca data between mjd 50995 and 52687 in 3@xmath1520 kev energy band . using the timing solution stated in table [ timingtable ]",
    ", we extract 671 individual pulses of the source .",
    "then we calculate the pulsed fraction and the mean count rate of each pulsation .",
    "the pulsed fractions are calculated with the standard definition ;    @xmath17    where @xmath18 and @xmath19 refers to minimum and maximum counts of the pulse .",
    "pulsed fractions are then rebinned according to the mean count rate of the pulsations .",
    "the results indicate that the pulsed fraction of the source correlates with the mean count rate ( see figure [ pf ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we present our results of timing analysis of _ rxte _ and _ integral _ observations of x per .",
    "firstly , using the cross correlation technique , we add new measurements to the pulse period history presented by lutovinov et al .",
    "( 2012 ) ( see table [ periods ] ) .    from the right panel of figure [ fluxfreqtime ]",
    ", it is seen that frequency derivative of the source correlates with x - ray flux when the source spins up or when the source spins down and the 3 - 20 kev x - ray flux is above @xmath20erg s@xmath6@xmath21 , while frequency derivative does not vary significantly when source spins down and 3  20 kev x - ray flux is below @xmath20erg s@xmath6@xmath21 .",
    "figure [ fluxfreqtime ] resembles figure 1 of shakura et al .",
    "( 2012 ) which presents frequency derivative as a function of normalized mass accretion rate ( which should be positively correlated with the x - ray flux ) of a neutron star accreting from stellar wind . in figure 1 of shakura",
    "et al . ( 2012 ) , a minimum spin - down rate value is reached when mass accretion rate is equal to a critical mass accretion rate ( @xmath22 ) above which spin rate is correlated with mass accretion rate .",
    "mass accretion rates below or above this value lead to smaller spin - down rates and above a certain normalized mass accretion rate value ( @xmath23 ) , the source enters a spin - up regime .",
    "this similarity may be an indication of the fact that the primary source of accreted matter is stellar quasi - spherical stellar wind of the companion .",
    "however , the transient qpo feature of the source suggests a transient formation of an accretion disc as the neutron star accretes via the companion s stellar wind .",
    "another low - luminosity long - orbital - period persistent accretion powered pulsar in a be  x - ray binary system , 1rxs j225352.8 + 624354 , has recently been found to show signs of a possible transient accretion disk formation ( esposito et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "quasi periodic oscillations ( qpos ) with peak frequencies between 0.01 and 0.4 hz have been observed in many accretion powered pulsars ( see inam et al .",
    "2004 and references therein ) .",
    "the qpo peak frequencies ( @xmath24 hz ) and rms amplitudes ( @xmath25 ) of x per are typical .    using a keplerian frequency model ( van der klis et al .",
    "1987 ) , qpo frequency is interpreted as the keplerian frequency at the inner radius of the accretion disc and can be expressed as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the neutron star mass which is taken as @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the radius of the inner disc and @xmath30 is the universal gravitational constant . using keplerian frequency model",
    ", we estimate inner disc radius ( @xmath29 ) as @xmath31 cm for the most prominent qpo observed at mjd 51060 with a frequency of 0.192 hz .",
    "it is important to note that as the x per s spin frequency is too small compared to its qpo frequency , it is not observationally possible to discriminate between keplerian frequency model and beat frequency model ( alpar and shaham 1985 ) .",
    "inner disc radius can also be expressed as ( ghosh and lamb 1979 ) , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the magnetic dipole moment , @xmath34 is the neutron star radius , taken as @xmath35 cm , @xmath36 is the mass accretion rate . at mjd 51060 ,",
    "when the most prominent qpo is observed , 3 - 20 kev luminosity of the source is @xmath37 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "this corresponds to a mass accretion rate of @xmath38 g s@xmath6 assuming that this luminosity value is of the order of the bolometric luminosity and using the relation @xmath39 .",
    "then , the value of @xmath40 gauss is estimated for the surface dipole magnetic field of the source .",
    "this magnetic field estimate is roughly comparable to some previous magnetic field estimates ( @xmath41 gauss ) of lutovinov et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and coburn et al .",
    "( 2001 ) based on cyclotron resonance scattering feature in the energy spectra , but our estimate is not consistent with the magnetar - like magnetic fields proposed for this source by doroshenko et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "power spectra of pulse frequency derivatives have been studied for several accretion powered x - ray pulsars .",
    "random walk in pulse frequency or white noise in pulse frequency derivative are suitable models for wind accreting systems like vela x-1 , 4u 1538 - 52 and gx 301 - 2 ( deeter 1981 , deeter et al .",
    "1989 , bildsten et al .",
    "they have flat power spectra with white noise strengths in the range @xmath42 hz s@xmath43 . for 4u 1907 + 09 random walk in pulse frequency",
    "is the appropriate model for frequencies between 1/1300 @xmath44 and 1/75 @xmath44 with noise strength @xmath45",
    "hz s@xmath43 ( ahiner et al .",
    "2012 ) . for 4u 1907 + 09 , ahiner et al .",
    "( 2012 ) suggested that at shorter time scales there may be a transient accretion disc formation around the neutron star which causes random walk in pulse frequency while the source has a long term steady spin down trend .",
    "her x-1 and 4u 1626 - 67 are disc accretors with low mass companions . for these sources it is found that pulse frequency time series are consistent with a random walk model with white noise strengths in the range @xmath46 to @xmath47 hz s@xmath43 , but red noise in pulse frequency derivative can not be excluded because of the sampling pulse frequencies and narrow range of power spectra .",
    "the disc accretor cen x-3 has red noise in its pulse frequency derivatives and the noise strength varies from low to high frequencies as @xmath48 to @xmath47 hz s@xmath43 ( bildsten et al . 1997 ) .",
    "power law index of power spectra of x per is @xmath49 .",
    "this implies that at short time scales disc accretion dominates and noise is less , on the other hand at longer time scales greater than viscous time scales there is excessive noise .",
    "the steepest power law index for the power spectra of pulse frequency derivatives among the hmxbs have been seen in sax j 2103.5 + 4545 with power law index 2.13 ( baykal et al .",
    "2007 ) . for gx 1 + 4 and oao 1657 - 415 power law indices",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath50 , respectively . for these sources",
    ", accretion discs can be formed at short time scales ( baykal 1997 , bildsten et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "x per has the lowest noise strength ( or torque noise ) among the hmxrbs discussed above ( baykal & gelman 1993 , bildsten et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "however the steep power law index or red noise in pulse frequency derivative suggests that it could have a transient accretion disc .    from the two average ( summed ) power spectra obtained from 411 day and 479 day long observations ( see figure [ ltpow ] )",
    ", we find that a power law model with two breaks that correspond to transitions from @xmath51 to @xmath52 and from @xmath52 to @xmath53 parts of the power spectra fits well to both power spectra .",
    "these break frequencies are shown to be insensitive to x - ray luminosity of the source which may indicate that accretion geometry is not affected significantly as the accretion rate changes .",
    "it is common to observe breaks in power spectra of accretion powered pulsars ( see revnivtsev et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) .",
    "two breaks observed in the average power spectra of x per may be an indication of the fact that the source has at least two different accretion flow components dominating the overall flow .",
    "these breaks sometimes also correspond to different spectral states of sources if power spectra are generated from data with a sufficiently long time interval ( see idem et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "the pulse fractions show a clear correlation with source count rate .",
    "as the flux increases the material appears to accrete more efficiently on the neutron star s magnetic poles . at higher mass accretion rates , the accreting plasma should be interacting with the magnetosphere closer to the neutron star .",
    "the shorter distance and the stronger field there could contribute to a higher fraction flowing to the poles .",
