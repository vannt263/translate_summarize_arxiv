    "we present an analysis of how parametric down converted photons could be very useful in getting better spectroscopic information about the medium .",
    "we demonstrate how the improvement in magneto - optical rotation ( mor ) of light could be realized by employing two different schemes with collinear and non - collinear down conversion geometry in compared to use of coherent light .",

    "we discuss that the heisenberg limit @xcite could be reached in magnetometry by the use down converted light .",
    "consider a single mode coherent light travelling in the z - direction and a linear isotropic medium made anisotropic by the application of the magnetic field @xmath4 in the z - direction .",
    "the incident field can be written in the form @xmath5 the medium is described by the frequency and magnetic field dependent susceptibilities @xmath6 .",
    "that means horizontally and vertically polarized components of the incident light will rotate on travelling the medium of length @xmath7 and the field at the exit can be written as @xmath8 the rotation of the horizontal and vertical components can be expressed by the relations @xmath9 where @xmath10    the corresponding quantum mechanical description can be obtained by replacing the classical amplitudes @xmath11 and @xmath12 by the annihilation operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively . for measurements with coherent sources one can look at the intensities of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 components of the output when the input is @xmath15 polarized with coherent state amplitude @xmath17 ( see fig .",

    "then the measured quantities will be @xmath18 one can estimate the minimum detectable rotation angle @xmath19 by looking at the fluctuations @xmath20 in the photon number difference between horizontal and vertical photons , where the number difference operator is given as @xmath21 .",
    "this expression is calculated to be @xmath22 and since the fluctuation noise is 1 we obtain @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the mean number of input photons which is equal to @xmath25 .",

    "collinearly down - converted photons we measure a rotation angle that is twice as large compared with the angle for a coherent input . for @xmath34",

    "making @xmath38 @xcite we get @xmath39 .",
    "note that the sensitivity of this quantity is also improved by a factor of @xmath3 .",
    "next , we discuss the non - collinear pdc case . we have found an arrangement shown in fig .",
    "[ setup](c ) which is especially attractive for improving sensitivity .",
    "the entangled photons are coming in two different spatial modes , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . while one mode ( say @xmath40 ) is going parallel to @xmath4 inside the medium , the other is going anti - parallel to it . at the exit we separate the @xmath42 and @xmath43 modes by polarizing beam splitters .",

    "we showed that the use of non - collinear type - ii pdc light in mor s increases the sensitivity by a factor of four in comparison to coherent light .",
    "we also give an argument that minimum rotation uncertainty scales to heisenberg limit by the use of down converted photons .",
    "it should be noted that heisenberg limit should be understood as an approximate limit at a large mean photon number , that is , the rotation uncertainty approaches the order of @xmath79 for large @xmath80 @xcite .",
