    "chemical turbulence in oscillatory reaction - diffusion systems can be completely suppressed by means of global feedback  @xcite . theoretically , this fact was found in the complex ginzburg - landau equation  @xcite , i.e. , the normal form of oscillatory reaction - diffusion systems near the supercritical hopf bifurcation point  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments on catalytic co oxidation on pt surface demonstrated the same fact , revealing also a variety of wave patterns caused by the effects of global delayed feedback  @xcite .",
    "a theoretical model for this reaction system reproduced similar behavior  @xcite .    in the present paper , we show that yet another transition of universal nature can occur at a certain feedback intensity which is much weaker than the critical intensity associated with the complete suppression of turbulence .",
    "the new type of transition is characterized by the emergence of small - amplitude collective oscillation out of the strongly turbulent medium without long - range phase coherence .",
    "when the collective oscillation appeared , the system remains strongly turbulent , while the effective damping rate of the uniform mode ( i.e. , the mean field ) shows a change of sign from positive to negative .",
    "thus , the transition is interpreted as a consequence of a complete cancellation of the effective damping of the mean field with the effect of its growth produced by the global feedback .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : langevin ] , we start with the complex ginzburg - landau equation ( cgl ) with global feedback",
    ". then we derive phenomenologically a nonlinear langevin equation governing the mean field in the form of a noisy stuart - landau equation ( sl ) . in order to clarify the nature of the transition of our concern ,",
    "some numerical results for the one- and two- dimensional cgl will be compared in secs .",
    "[ sec : results ] and [ sec : two ] , respectively , with analytical results obtained from the noisy sl . concluding remarks will be given in the final section .",
    "one - dimensional complex ginzburg - landau equation with global feedback is given by  @xcite @xmath0 @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a complex field , and @xmath3 is the system size which is supposed to be sufficiently large .",
    "the intensity @xmath4 of the global feedback is generally a complex number .",
    "it is known , however , that a suitable tuning of the delay time in the feedback in the original system can control the phase of this parameter  @xcite . for the sake of simplicity , therefore , we shall confine our present analysis to the case of real @xmath4 , which corresponds to the situation where the delay time in the feedback is fixed at a certain value but the feedback intensity is allowed to vary .",
    "a brief comment will be made on the case of complex @xmath4 in the final section .",
    "we first consider the system without feedback ( @xmath5 ) , i.e. , the usual one - dimensional cgl  @xcite .",
    "as is well known , uniform oscillations are linearly unstable and turbulence develops when the benjamin - feir instability condition @xmath6 is satisfied . in what follows , we will fix the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 as @xmath9 and @xmath10 so that the system may stay well within the turbulent regime .",
    "we confirmed that under this condition no collective oscillation exists , i.e. , @xmath11 is randomly fluctuating on a `` microscopic '' scale around the zero value without perceptible systematic motion .",
    "the core of our argument developed below depends little on the choice of parameter values as far as the condition  ( [ eq : bf ] ) is well satisfied .",
    "it is known that if the turbulence is sufficiently strong , which is actually the case under the above parameter condition , the system exhibits extensive chaos characterized by the property  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the lyapunov dimension of the high - dimensional chaotic attractor describing the turbulence .",
    "extensive chaos implies that the system can be imagined as composed of a large number of cells of equal size such that the fluctuations of some variables associated with the individual cells about their mean value are statistically independent from cell to cell .",
    "thus , the fluctuations of a macro - variable , i.e. , a variable given by a simple sum of cell variables over the entire system , are expected to obey the central limit theorem .",
    "in particular , in the absence of long - range order , the characteristic amplitude of @xmath11 will scale like @xmath14 for large system size .",
    "if we represent our continuous oscillatory medium with a long array of @xmath15 oscillators with sufficiently small but fixed separation between neighboring oscillators , which we actually do in numerical simulations to be described below , we expect asymptotically the property @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the complex amplitude of the @xmath18-th oscillator in the array .",
    "the simple nature of the extensive variable @xmath11 mentioned above also implies that its time - correlation function defined by @xmath19 obeys a simple exponential decay law for large @xmath20 , or @xmath21 the effective damping coefficient @xmath22 is a quantity which could only be determined from the statistical mechanics of turbulent fluctuations which is still far from being established .",
    "the above decay law is confirmed from our numerical simulation .",
    "figure  [ fig : decay ] shows numerically calculated @xmath23 from which the exponential law with @xmath24 is confirmed except for some initial transient . in this numerical simulation , and in all numerical simulations which follow ,",
    "we applied an explicit euler integration scheme with a constant time step @xmath25 and a fixed grid size @xmath26 , adopting periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the system size @xmath15 used ranges from @xmath27 to @xmath28 .    ,",
    "i.e. , the mean tangent ( the broken line ) of the curve with the initial transient excluded , is estimated to be @xmath29 .",
    "the system size is @xmath30.,width=302 ]    we now introduce global feedback and study its effects on the dynamics of the mean field .",
    "let the complex amplitude be decomposed into fourier series as @xmath31 where @xmath32 ( @xmath33 is an integer ) , and the fourier amplitudes are defined by @xmath34 the uniform amplitude @xmath35 , which is identical with the mean field @xmath11 by definition , obeys the equation @xmath36 one may wish to obtain an equation for the mean field in a closed form , which would be a stochastic equation of the nonlinear langevin type .",
    "however , deriving such an equation would be a formidable statistical mechanical problem , so that in the present paper we will content ourselves by simply assuming phenomenologically that the effective exponential decay of the mean field as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : decay ] is a result of renormalization of the linear coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ eq : um ] ) by the nonlinear mode - coupling term .",
    "if we can neglect non - markovian effects , the result of such renormalization will generally take the form of a nonlinear langevin equation @xmath37\\bar{w } + { \\cal n}\\left(\\bar{w}\\right)+f(t ) , \\label{eq : le}\\ ] ] where a nonlinear term @xmath38 with unknown specific form has been included , and @xmath39 represents random force with vanishing mean .    the analysis of eq .",
    "( [ eq : le ] ) developed in the following section is based on the simplifying assumption that @xmath39 is white gaussian with the only non - vanishing second moment given by @xmath40 the gaussian nature of the random force seems to hold due to the aforementioned extensive nature of @xmath11 .",
    "the white - noise assumption also seems valid because we are particularly concerned with the situation near the transition point where the characteristic time scale of @xmath11 becomes very long .",
    "we should also note that the damping coefficient @xmath22 has been assumed to be unchanged when the global feedback is introduced , which is actually the property confirmed by our numerical experiments at least for real @xmath4 .",
    "our final remark is that in the above argument about eq .",
    "( [ eq : le ] ) we did not explicitly refer to spatial dimension .",
    "therefore , there seems to be no reason why eq .",
    "( [ eq : le ] ) should not be applied to systems of two or higher dimensions .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : le ] ) tells that a transition occurs when the global feedback intensity @xmath4 becomes equal to the effective damping coefficient @xmath22 of the mean filed .",
    "we denote this value of @xmath4 as @xmath41 , or @xmath42 figure  [ fig : over ] shows numerically obtained long - time averages of the mean field amplitude , denoted as @xmath43 , as a function of the feedback intensity @xmath4 over a wide range of @xmath4 . although not very clear from these data , there is an indication of transition from vanishing to non - vanishing @xmath43 at some value of @xmath4 much smaller than those giving rise to a hysteresis between turbulent and non - turbulent uniform states .",
    "in fact , the whole analysis in the rest of this paper is devoted to finding out unambiguous evidence for the existence of a transition through a closer investigation of small-@xmath4 region .     as a function of the feedback intensity @xmath4 over a wide range of @xmath4 .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to uniform oscillations .",

    "[ fig : stp ] , two space - time plots of the complex amplitude modulus for @xmath45 ( weaker feedback ) and @xmath46 ( stronger feedback ) are indistinguishable . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] , however , two phase portraits in the complex amplitude plane each obtained for @xmath45 and @xmath46 are contrasted with each other . while the distribution of the representative points of the local oscillators looks almost isotropic for the case of @xmath45 , implying the absence of collective oscillations , such symmetry is obviously lost when @xmath46 , implying the existence of collective oscillations .",
    "qualitative difference between the two situations is further confirmed from fig .",
    "[ fig : orbit ] where a trajectory of the mean field over a long time at each value of @xmath4 is displayed .",
    "it is clear that when the feedback is weak the mean field is non - oscillatory , simply fluctuating ( presumably due to the finite - size effects described above ) around the origin , whereas for stronger feedback the same quantity clearly exhibits a closed orbit with some amplitude fluctuation again due to the finite - size effects .",
    "thus , if there is a transition somewhere between these @xmath4-values , it is presumably characterized by a noisy hopf bifurcation .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      ( a ) and @xmath46 ( b ) at a given time .",

    "the mean field is fluctuating around the origin when @xmath45 , while it forms a closed orbit with small amplitude fluctuations when @xmath46 .",
    "the fluctuations come from the finiteness of the system size .",
    "the system size is @xmath47.,width=302 ]    the nonlinear langevin equation  ( [ eq : le ] ) actually predicts the occurrence of a noisy hopf bifurcation . from the symmetry of our system and the smallness in amplitude of the collective oscillation near its onset ,",
    "the nonlinear effects @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : le ] ) will be dominated by a cubic term .",
    "then the mean field obeys a noisy stuart - landau equation @xmath48\\bar{w } -\\left(\\eta+i\\alpha\\right)\\left|\\bar{w}\\right|^2\\bar{w}+f(t ) , \\label{eq : sl}\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath41 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are real and depend generally on @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",

    "similarly , the mean field fluctuation @xmath62 is given by @xmath63 which holds for @xmath64 .",
    "it is clear that the critical exponents associated with @xmath43 and @xmath65 obey the classical law or the mean field theory , reflecting the fact that the transition is caused by the applied mean field and not by the development of local order to a macroscopic scale .",
    "still the transition is in some sense statistical in nature unlike bifurcations in deterministic dynamical systems .",
