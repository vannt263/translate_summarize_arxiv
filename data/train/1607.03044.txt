    "we use an external - cavity diode laser at @xmath39809  nm to seed a tapered amplifier ( moglabs , moa002 ) , which provides 1.8  w of output power .",
    "the resulting beam is coupled into a single - mode fiber , and passed through three laser clean - up filters ( semrock ll01 - 808 ) .",
    "this results in a 4  mm beam with @xmath39550  mw of power , which is split into an array of beams by an acousto - optic deflector ( aod ) ( aa opto - electronic model dtsx-400 - 800.850 ) .",
    "these beams pass through a 1:1 telescope with 300  mm focal length and are then focused by a 0.5  na microscope objective ( mitutoyo g plan apo 50x ) into our vacuum chamber to form an array of optical tweezers ( fig .",
    "1b of the main text ) .",
    "these tweezers have a waist of @xmath39900  nm , and their centers are separated by 2.6@xmath40 m .",
    "each beam has @xmath391  mw of optical power , corresponding to a trap depth of @xmath390.9  mk for @xmath41rb atoms .",
    "the experimental sequence begins by laser cooling thermal @xmath41rb atoms in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) around the traps for 100 ms ( fig .",
    "we use a gradient field of 9.7 g / cm , and three intersecting retroreflected beams that are 17 mhz red detuned of the free space @xmath42 transition , overlapped with repumper beams resonant with the free space @xmath43 transition .",
    "one of these beams is perpendicular to the optical table , and the other two are parallel to it ( intersecting at an angle of @xmath44 due to the geometric restriction imposed by the high resolution objectives ) .",
    "all three beams have a diameter of @xmath391.5  cm , and carry @xmath391.5  mw of cooling light and @xmath390.4  mw of repumping light each .",
    "to reduce the necessary time to load the mot , we shine uv light from a diode at 365  nm directly on the region of the glass cell within which the mot is loaded @xcite .",
    "after 100  ms , the magnetic field gradient and the mot beams are turned off to allow the mot to dissipate over 28 ms . at the same time we turn on a set of probe beams which are 20 mhz red - detuned from the bare atom @xmath42 transition .",
    "the probe beams have the same geometric configuration as the mot beams , but they have @xmath3950 times less power , and a diameter of @xmath391  mm , which largely reduces background light due to stray reflections during imaging .",
    "the probe beams further cool the atoms through polarization - gradient cooling , and are left on for the remainder of the sequence .",
    "the result of this process is the probabilistic loading of atoms into the traps .",

    "is scattered by the atoms and collected on the emccd , forming an image of the atoms in the array .",
    "based on the collected photon statistics for each trap , we can set clear thresholds to determine the presence of an atom in a trap ( see fig .",
    "furthermore , the bimodal nature of the photon statistics is an indication that the traps are occupied by either 0 or 1 atom .",
    "once the emccd has finished acquiring the signal , the image file is transferred over the following 10  ms to a computer which determines trap occupations , using pre - calibrated regions of interest and threshold counts for each trap , in sub - ms time . using this information ,",
    "the computer finds the correct pre - calculated waveform to displace each occupied trap during 3  ms from its initial position to its final position , and then adds up all of them into a multi - tone frequency - sweep waveform .",
    "this computation takes @xmath390.2  ms for each trap to be displaced .",
    "once the waveform is ready , it is sent to the aod to perform the trap displacement , and then it goes back to producing the original set of 100 traps .",
    "it is important to note that the rearrangement waveform is only calculated for loaded traps , which means that all empty traps are turned off for the duration of the rearrangement but are restored immediately afterwards , so that the trap array returns after rearrangement to its original configuration .",
    "after rearrangement , there is a @xmath397  ms buffer time before taking another 20  ms exposure image with the emccd . the entire process , consisting of image acquisition , transfer , analysis , waveform generation , rearrangement , and buffer , takes a total of 50  ms .",
    "currently , the profile of the frequency sweeps is calculated to be piece - wise quadratic in time , over a duration of 3  ms . for shorter transport times",
    "we observe an increase in the number of atoms lost during rearrangement .",
    "for the experiments reported in the main text , atom losses are only slightly increased compared to the expected lifetime in static traps ( see fig .",
    "these losses depend on the distance that the atoms move , and it is possible that they could be reduced by changing the length or the profile of the frequency sweep to minimize acceleration and jerk during the trajectory .",
    "however , the fidelity of our rearrangement would not be significantly improved by minimizing these losses ( see fig .",

    "when driving the aod with a single radio frequency ( rf ) tone , a portion of the input beam is deflected by an angle @xmath46 that depends on the frequency @xmath47 of the tone . by applying 100 different rf tones",
    "@xmath48 , we generate 100 beams with output angles @xmath49 , where @xmath50 .",
    "the waveform that we send into the aod is initially calculated by a computer that samples the desired waveform in the time - domain with a sampling rate of 100 mhz .",
    "we stream these waveform samples to a software defined radio ( sdr ) ( ettus research , model usrp x310 , daughterboard ubx  160 ) which performs digital - analog conversion , low - pass filtering , and subsequent analog iq upconversion by a frequency of @xmath51  mhz , and outputs an analog waveform , which we then amplify and send to the aod .",
    "the waveform that we calculate initially is given by : @xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 being the real amplitude and phase , respectively , of the rf tone with frequency @xmath55 .",
    "since we generate all tones in the same waveform ( relative to the same local oscillator inside the sdr ) , the tones in our waveform have well - defined phases @xmath56 relative to one another . also , since all the frequencies we use are integer multiples of 1  khz , we calculate a 1  ms waveform which is streamed on a loop without needing to continuously generate new samples .",
    "the finite power bandwidth , along with other imperfections of our system ( rf amplifier and aod ) generate a nonlinear response to the input signal . to the lowest order nonlinearity ,",
    "the system acts as a mixer and generates new tones at the sum and difference of the input frequencies .",
    "for example , for two tones , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , at the input , there will be a corresponding set of tones at the output : @xmath59 @xmath60    these terms are far removed from the main set of desired tones @xmath61 and can in principle be filtered by frequency .",
    "however , they seed the next order of nonlinearity .",
    "the next order of nonlinearity contains the mixing of these first order nonlinearities with the original tones .",
    "for example , with two tones we would now see a mixing of the @xmath62 tone with the original @xmath63 tone to produce a sum tone at @xmath64 and a difference tone at @xmath65 . similarly , the @xmath62 tone would mix with the original @xmath65 tone to produce a tone at @xmath66 and @xmath63 . if the phases of each input tone @xmath56 are not carefully selected , these intermodulations interfere destructively with the original tones , as shown in fig .",
    "s3a .",
    "we address the issue of intermodulations by adjusting the phases of the different rf tones to almost completely cancel out the nonlinearities . as a first step ,",
    "we generate a computer simulation of 100 tones evenly spaced in frequency and with random phases , and equal amplitudes . for each pair of traps",
    "@xmath67 , we calculate the difference tone @xmath68 . by starting with random initial phases ,",
    "the difference tones nearly completely destructively interfere with one another .",
    "we then optimize each phase , one at a time , to further reduce the sum of all difference tones @xmath69 . after this",
    ", we proceed to generate the waveform to be streamed onto the sdr .",
    "the starting amplitudes for each tone are selected such that they individually produce a single deflection carrying the correct amount of optical power .",
    "the frequencies span from 74.5 mhz to 123.01 mhz in steps of 0.49 mhz .",
    "the next step in optimization consists of imaging the focused trap array on a ccd and performing 2d gaussian fits .",
    "we use the amplitude of these fits to feed back on the amplitude of the individual tones .",
    "once all the fitted amplitudes are approximately uniform , we continue to the last step of optimization .",
    "since we are interested in the uniformity of the traps at the positions of the atoms , we measure the ac stark shifts induced by the traps , and use these values to feed back on the amplitude of each tone . in order to extract the ac stark shift ,",
    "we shine a single laser beam onto the trapped atoms for @xmath70s , and measure the loss probability introduced by this ",
    "pushout \" beam as a function of detuning from the bare @xmath42 resonance ( fig .",
    "s4a inset ) . from the fits we extract the individual lightshift for each trap and use these values to perform feedback on the amplitudes .",
    "we repeat the procedure until the shifted resonances are uniform to within @xmath71 across the trap array ( fig .",
    "s4a ) . at this point",
    "we have a set of optimal amplitudes @xmath72 and phases @xmath73 associated with the rf frequencies @xmath74 ( fig .",
    "we interpolate between the values of @xmath72 to define the optimal amplitude as a function of frequency @xmath75 .",

    "( * a * ) the trapping light causes a lightshift on the atomic resonances that depends on the amplitude of the trap .",
    "the measured lightshifts across the array are used to optimize the rf amplitudes @xmath76 .",
    "this process results in homogeneous traps with lightshifts that are uniform to within @xmath392% .",
    "inset shows the result of a `` pushout '' measurement ( see text ) on trap 26 that is used to determine the individual lightshift .",
    "( * b * ) the trap frequencies are determined from a release and recapture measurement @xcite ( see inset for trap  26 ) .",
    "the errors from the fits are smaller than the marker size for all the figures . ]    to characterize the homogeneity of the final trap configuration , we perform experiments to determine the ac stark shift and trap frequency for each trap in the array ( fig .",
    "s4 ) .    as outlined in the previous section , the measurement of the ac stark shift is used to equalize the traps .",
    "we find an average shift of 17.5 mhz with a standard deviation of 0.1 mhz across the whole array .    the trap frequency ( fig .",
    "s4b ) is found through a release and recapture technique @xcite .",
    "we obtain the radial frequency from a fit to the probability of retaining an atom as a function of hold time ( fig .",
    "s4b  inset ) .",
    "we find the average trap frequency to be 98.7  khz with a standard deviation of 1.7  khz across the array .",
    "combining these measurements with an independent determination of the waist , we estimate a trap depth of @xmath390.9  mk .      for most of the experimental sequence time ,",
    "the traps are static .",
    "however , during short bursts we stream new waveforms to the aod to rearrange them , and the atoms they hold .",
    "we move our traps by sweeping the frequencies @xmath77 of the tones that correspond to the traps we wish to move , in a piecewise - quadratic fashion .",
    "this way , the atoms experience a constant acceleration @xmath78 for the first half of the trajectory , and @xmath79 for the second half . during the sweep , we also continuously adjust the amplitude of the rf tone to match the optimized amplitude for its current frequency : @xmath80 .",
    "further , by slightly adjusting the duration of each sweep , we enforce each trap to end with the optimal phase corresponding to its new position .    using these parameters we pre - calculate all waveforms to sweep the frequency of a tone at",
    "any given starting frequency in our array to any given final frequency , over 3 ms .",
    "this amounts to @xmath81 precalculated trajectories .",
    "the lifetime for each trap is found by an exponential fit to the probability of retaining an atom as a function of time . under optimal conditions , this results in an average lifetime for the traps in our array of 11.6  s with a standard deviation of 0.5  s across the array .",
    "however , this value depends on the background pressure inside the vacuum chamber and therefore depends on the current with which we drive our dispenser atom source . for the measurements presented in fig .  3 of the main text ,",
    "an average lifetime of 6.2  s was found from independent calibration measurements .    in these measurements ,",
    "we apply continuous laser cooling throughout the hold time .",
    "we observe that without continuous cooling , the lifetime is reduced compared to these values . the retention as a function of time in this case",
    "does not follow a simple exponential decay ( indicative of a heating process ) , and we define the time at which the retention probability crosses @xmath82 to be the lifetime . for the standard configuration in the main text ( 100 traps with 0.49  mhz spacing between neighboring frequencies ) ,",
    "we find a lifetime of @xmath83 .",
    "while we have not characterized the source of the lifetime reduction in detail , we have carried out a number of measurements in different configurations to distinguish various effects :    * generating a single trap by driving the aod with a single frequency from a high - quality signal generator ( rhode & schwartz smc100a ) , we find a lifetime of @xmath84 .",
    "this indicates that there are additional heating effects , such as photon scattering from trap light or intensity noise , that are independent of the use of the sdr or the fact that we drive the aod with a large number of frequencies .",
    "possible improvements include using further detuned trap light and improving our intensity stabilization .",
    "furthermore , in a separate experiment  @xcite , we observed that using a titanium - sapphire laser instead of a ta significantly improved trap lifetimes even at the same trapping wavelength . * generating a single trap by driving the aod with a single frequency from the sdr , we find a lifetime of @xmath85 .",
    "this indicates that the rf - waveforms from the sdr could have additional phase or intensity noise .",
    "a possible source is the local oscillator used for iq upconversion in the sdr , which could be replaced with a more phase - stable version .",
    "* we observe the same trap lifetime of @xmath85 when driving the aod with 70 frequencies at a spacing of @xmath86 mhz using the sdr .",
    "this indicates that , in principle , there is no lifetime reduction associated with driving the aod with a large number of frequencies .",
    "* we observe a reduction of lifetime for frequency spacings smaller than @xmath87 .",
    "for example , we found a lifetime of @xmath83 , when setting the frequency spacing to @xmath88 .",
    "( this lifetime is unchanged by increasing the number of traps from 70 to 100 . )",
    "we interpret this effect to be the result of interference between neighboring traps .",
    "due to the finite spatial overlap of the tweezer light , a time - dependent modulation occurs with a frequency given by the frequency spacing between neighboring traps . when bringing traps closer together , both the spatial overlap increases and the modulation frequency approaches the parametric heating resonance at @xmath89 given by twice the radial trapping frequency",
    ".    we would like to stress that these effects only play a role after the rearrangement procedure is completed . during rearrangement ,",
    "continuous laser cooling is a valid and powerful method to reduce heating effects .",
    "additionally , the flexibility of our system makes it possible to load and continuously cool atoms in a set of closely spaced traps , and to rearrange the filled traps to an array with larger separations , at which point cooling can be turned off .",
    "this method of rearrangement takes advantage of the large number of atoms that can be initially loaded in our set of 100 traps separated by 0.49 mhz , while eliminating the effect of interference by setting a larger final frequency separation of , for example , 0.7 mhz .",
    "furthermore , atoms could also be transferred into a fully  static \" trap array , such as an optical lattice , after rearrangement .",
    "however , even with optimal cooling parameters , heating effects can not be always compensated .",
    "for example , we observed a significant reduction of lifetime for frequency spacings below @xmath90 even with continuous laser cooling .",
    "this sets a limit on the maximum number of traps that can be generated within the bandwitdh of our aod , and therefore limits the final sizes of the atomic arrays .",
    "in this section we will discuss possible extensions of our method to form uniformly filled two - dimensional ( 2d ) arrays .",
    "we will describe two different rearrangement strategies and compare their performance given realistic parameters for loading efficiencies and lifetimes .      using a 2d aod",
    "we could generate a 2d array of optical tweezers using two sets of rf tones , one set corresponding to rows and the other corresponding to columns .",
    "after loading atoms probabilistically into the array , it would be possible to eliminate each defect by turning off the rf frequency that generates either the row or the column containing the defect , and then transport all remaining rows and columns to form a defect - free uniform array .",
    "a different approach is to generate a static two - dimensional array of traps using techniques such as optical lattices or spatial - light modulators . in a first step ,",
    "atoms would be probabilistically loaded into this static array .",
    "after loading , we could use an independent aod to generate a linear array of traps , deeper than the ones forming the static array and overlapping precisely with one row of static traps . by rearranging the linear array",
    ", we could transfer the atoms to their final locations in the static configuration , where they would remain after turning off the traps used for transport . doing this for",
    "each row would make it possible to fill an entire region of the static 2d array .",
    "the final size of the array will depend on the initial loading efficiency , while the probability to have a defect - free array after rearrangement will depend on the atom lifetimes in the traps , and the total feedback time .",
    "this time consists of several blocks : image taking , image transfer , waveform calculation , and trap movement .",
    "we can take an image in 20  ms . the time it takes to transfer the image from the camera to the computer takes a minimum of 9 ms and each row of atoms adds 0.8 ms to the transfer time . analyzing the image to determine",
    "the location of the atoms and necessary frequency sweeps can be done in sub - ms time . generating the waveform takes @xmath390.2  ms for each sweep necessary .",
    "this time scales as the final number of atoms ( @xmath91 ) for method  2 , and with the final number of rows and columns ( @xmath92 ) for method  1 .",
    "finally , the rearrangement itself takes 3  ms for each set of frequency sweeps : for method 1 there are two sweeps , and for method 2 the number of sweeps equals the number of rows .",
    "figure s5 shows the result of a monte carlo simulation for the expected number of atoms in a defect - free rectangular array using two sets of parameters , and both rearrangement methods described above .",
    "given our current loading efficiency of @xmath93 and vacuum - limited lifetime of @xmath3910  s , we can expect more than 160 atoms in the final defect - free configuration ( fig .",
    "s5a ,  c ) .",
    "however , if we were to upgrade our vacuum setup to increase the lifetime from 10  s to 60  s , and we increased the loading efficiency to 0.9 using currently available techniques @xcite , we could expect more than 600 atoms in defect - free configurations ( fig .",
    "s5b ,  d ) .",
    "these numbers were calculated by simulating a sequence that performed repeated rearrangement until no more defects appeared , and every point on the plot is the average of 500 simulations .",

    "<S> while the initial filling of our array is probabilistic , the rearranged configurations show highly ordered atom arrays . </S>",
    "<S> our approach also allows us to construct flexible atomic patterns as shown in fig .  2c .    </S>",
    "<S> the rearrangement procedure creates defect - free arrays with high fidelity . </S>",
    "<S> this can be quantified by considering the improvement of single atom occupation probabilities ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3a ) and the success probabilities , @xmath13 , for creating defect - free arrays of length @xmath14 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the single atom occupation probability in the left - most forty traps increases from @xmath15 before rearrangement to @xmath16 after rearrangement , demonstrating our ability for high - fidelity single - atom preparation . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the success probabilities for creating defect - free arrays show an exponential improvement . </S>",
    "<S> prior to rearrangement , the probability of finding a defect - free array of length @xmath14 is exponentially suppressed with @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( blue circles , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b ) . after rearrangement , </S>",
    "<S> we find success probabilities as high as @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( red circles , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the same exponential improvement is observed by considering the average wait time for producing defect - free arrays , given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the cycling time of our experiment  ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b ) . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we are able to generate defect - free arrays of @xmath0 atoms with an average wait time of less than @xmath1 ( red circles , fig </S>",
    "<S> .  3c ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the likelihood of finding defect - free arrays of this length without rearrangement is so small that the corresponding wait time would be on the order of several hundred years .    </S>",
    "<S> the success probabilities can be further enhanced through multiple repetitions of the rearrangement protocol . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 illustrates the procedure in which we target an atomic array of fixed length and create a reservoir from surplus atoms in a separate zone . after the initial arrangement of atoms into the target and reservoir zones , we periodically take images to identify defects in the target array and pull atoms from the reservoir to fill in these defects . </S>",
    "<S> this enhances our initial success probabilities at producing defect - free arrays within one mot - loading cycle to nearly the ideal limit ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4c ) .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , a similar procedure can be used for correcting errors associated with atomic loss . </S>",
    "<S> this becomes a significant limitation for large arrays since for a given lifetime of an individual atom in the trap @xmath23 , the corresponding lifetime of the @xmath14 atom array scales as @xmath24 . to counter this loss </S>",
    "<S> , we repeatedly detect the array occupation after longer time intervals and replenish lost atoms from the reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> as demonstrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4d , this procedure leads to exponentially enhanced lifetimes of our arrays .    </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate the ability to generate and control large , defect - free arrays at a fast repetition rate . </S>",
    "<S> the success probabilities are limited by two factors : the initial number of loaded atoms and losses during rearrangement . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the average total atom number in our array is @xmath25  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which results in the cutoff in the success probability in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b starting from @xmath26 ( solid line ) . for shorter arrays , </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity is mostly limited by losses during rearrangement . </S>",
    "<S> these losses are dominated by our finite vacuum - limited lifetime , which varies from @xmath27 to @xmath28 ( depending on the setting of our atomic dispenser source ) , and are only minimally increased by the movement of the atoms  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the single atom occupation probability is correspondingly reduced by a factor @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the time for the whole rearrangement procedure  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this results in the success probabilities of creating length-@xmath14 arrays scaling as @xmath31 , which dominates the slope for @xmath32 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b ( dashed line ) . currently , we reach vacuum limited lifetimes only with sub - doppler cooling applied throughout the sequence </S>",
    "<S> . however , the lifetime without cooling could be improved , for example , by using a different trapping laser and trapping wavelength  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the size of the final arrays can be considerably increased by implementing a number of realistic experimental improvements . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the initial loading probability could be enhanced to @xmath33  @xcite and the vacuum limited lifetime could be improved to @xmath34 in an upgraded vacuum chamber . increasing the number of traps in the current configuration is difficult due to the aod bandwidth of @xmath35 and strong parametric heating introduced when the frequency spacing of neighboring traps approaches @xmath36  @xcite . however , implementing two - dimensional ( 2d ) arrays could provide a path towards realizing thousands of traps , ultimately limited by the availability of laser power and the field of view of high - resolution objectives </S>",
    "<S> . such 2d configurations could be realized by either directly using a 2d - aod or by creating a static 2d lattice of traps ( using spatial light modulators  @xcite or optical lattices  @xcite ) and sorting atoms with an independent aod  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> realistic estimates for the rearrangement time @xmath37 in such 2d arrays indicate that the robust creation of defect - free arrays of hundreds of atoms is feasible  @xcite . finally , the repetitive interrogation techniques , in combination with periodic reservoir reloading from a cold atom source ( such as a mot ) , could be used to maintain arrays indefinitely .    </S>",
    "<S> remarkable recent advances have been made in building , exploring , and applying engineered quantum matter in systems ranging from ion traps  @xcite and ultracold atoms  @xcite to solid - state qubits such as superconducting qubits  @xcite and color - centers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> atom - by - atom assembly of defect - free arrays forms a novel scalable platform with unique possibilities . </S>",
    "<S> it combines features that are typically associated with ion trapping experiments , such as single - qubit addressability  @xcite and fast cycling times , with the flexible optical trapping of neutral atoms in a scalable fashion . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in contrast to solid - state platforms , such atomic arrays are formed of indistinguishable particles and are mostly decoupled from their environment .    </S>",
    "<S> these features provide an excellent starting point for engineering interactions in multi - qubit experiments and for exploring novel applications . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , our approach can be used for the realization of logical qubits based on quantum registers consisting of up to several dozens of atomic spin qubits . </S>",
    "<S> the necessary entangling operations can be realized using atomic rydberg states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the parallelism afforded by our flexible atom rearrangement enables efficient diagnostics of such rydberg - mediated entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the use of atomic configurations demonstrated in fig .  2c , supplemented by the repetitive reloading mechanism in fig </S>",
    "<S> .  4 , could allow fidelities to be optimized to their theoretical limit  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar techniques can be used for novel approaches to quantum simulations using both coherent coupling and engineered dissipation  @xcite and for creating large - scale maximally entangled quantum states for applications in precision measurements  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the realization of homogeneous arrays  @xcite should allow for simultaneous sideband cooling of atoms in optical tweezers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ground state fractions in excess of @xmath38 have already been demonstrated , and can likely be improved via additional optical trapping along the longitudinal tweezer axes . </S>",
    "<S> this could enable bottom - up approaches to studying quantum many - body physics in hubbard models  @xcite , where atomic mott insulators with fixed atom number and complex spin patterns could be directly assembled without the fluctuations and long cycling times associated with evaporative cooling . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , these techniques could potentially be applied to create ultracold quantum matter composed of exotic atomic species or complex molecules  @xcite that are difficult to cool evaporatively . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our atom arrays are ideally suited for integration with hybrid atom - nanophotonic platforms  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these can be employed to couple the atoms within a local multi - qubit register or for efficient communication between the registers using a modular quantum network architecture  @xcite .     </S>",
