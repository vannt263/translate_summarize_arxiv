    "the 2175  uv extinction feature was discovered in 1965 by @xcite with sounding rocket observations . since then , several satellite observatories helped to characterize it towards many sightlines @xcite , yet its physical origin is still being debated .",
    "one suggested origin is absorption by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) molecules , that are the most abundant organic molecules in nature and a key ingredient of the interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite . indeed , theoretical molecular structure computations @xcite as well as by laboratory experiments @xcite indicate that pahs absorb ultraviolet ( uv ) light and emit in broad mid ir ( mir ) bands .",
    "these works and other have ascribed the 2175  feature to very small graphite grains @xcite .    pahs are organic molecules composed of c and h atoms , structured in the form of multiple aromatic rings with delocalized electrons .",
    "they contain up to 10% of the c content in our galaxy , and have thus been hypothesized to play a key role in the earliest forms of organic life in the universe @xcite .",
    "the pahs are ubiquitous in the ism , as revealed by their emission bands in the mir around 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.2 , and 12.7 @xmath0 m , originating in different vibrational modes @xcite .",
    "the typical temperature of ism dust grains ( @xmath2 100 k ) can not account for efficient mir emission , which is thus attributed to smaller species with low heat capacity , such as pahs .",
    "the excitation energies of @xmath3ev then imply typical molecule sizes of about 50 c - atoms @xcite the pah hypothesis is , thus , that the mir pah emission is excited by uv photons in the ism , although perhaps not exclusively @xcite .    mid ir observations with the _ iso _  and _ spitzer _",
    "space telescopes revealed the pah emission band profiles , and their relative intensities @xcite .",
    "observations showed a dependence of the central wavelength of the 6.2 , 7.7 , and 8.6 @xmath0 m bands on the illuminating stellar temperature @xcite .",
    "the variation in band position has been attributed to varying size and charge of the pah molecules @xcite .",
    "the position of the uv extinction feature 2175 , on the other hand , is rather uniform .",
    "this contrasts with the diversity of pahs @xcite , ism conditions , and thus challenges the pah hypothesis . nonetheless ,",
    "a small number of cases have been reported where the uv extinction feature occurs at longer wavelengths @xcite .    here",
    ", we use an analysis of a new sample of stars that have both uv and mir spectra to demonstrate the missing connection between the uv absorption and mir emission bands .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "[ discussion ] we conclude with a discussion and draw the conclusion in sec .  [ conclusions ] .",
    "we assembled a sample of objects of spectral type a2 and earlier ( hotter ) that have spectra both from the iue  ( uv ) , and from either the _ spitzer _  or _ iso _  ( mir ) telescopes .",
    "we did not impose any visible extinction requirements ; therefore , the present sample includes many stars with low color excess that would not be included in studies aimed at obtaining general extinction curves .",
    "we identified 27 stars that have both significant ( equivalent width @xmath4 ) uv absorption around 2175 , and significant pah emission ( @xmath5 m in the 7.7 @xmath0 m band ) .",
    "although not selected for it , most stars in the present sample happen to be pre main - sequence stars that are shrouded in dust and gas , often in the form of a proto - planetary disk , which has been shown to provide favorable conditions for the growth of large pahs @xcite .",
    "besides its main attribute of including both uv and ir spectra , the present sample is unique in that it extends both to cooler stars ( down to 8.25 kk ) than those usually studied in the uv , and to hotter stars ( up to 37 kk ) than those usually studied in the ir .    in order to test the uv - mir connection and its relation to pahs",
    ", we also constructed a control sample of 32 stars with uv absorption ( @xmath4 ) , but with no detectable mir emission ( @xmath6 m at 7.7 @xmath0 m ) , for comparison .",
    "a list of the present sample can be found in table  1 ; objects 1 - 27 are those with both uv absorption and pah mir emission , while objects 28 - 59 are those with uv absorption but no detectable mir emission .",
    "spectral type and b & v magnitudes were taken from the simbad astronomical database .",
    "stellar temperatures @xmath7  were determined from @xcite according to spectral type . given the poor knowledge of the bolometric corrections , @xmath7 is uncertain by a few percent @xcite , which is insignificant here .",
    "intrinsic b@xmath8 -v@xmath8 values for main sequence stars were taken from the space telescope science institute ( stsci ) 2002 archive , for other spectral types we used @xcite tables .    despite the fact that the hubble space telescope ( ) has improved uv capabilities compared to iue ,",
    "had it observed only about 10% as many uv - bright stars as iue .",
    "for example , only two stars from our sample have adequate hst spectra therefore we used the iue data .",
    "moreover , the two cases in which the hst and iue had the same objects the analyzed results was similar .",
    "[ [ uv ] ] uv ~~    the iue  spectra were extracted from the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) , and comprise of data obtained by three cameras .",
    "the short wavelength camera ( swp ) includes spectra from 1150  to 1978 , the two long wavelength cameras ( lwp & lwr ) include spectra from 1850  to 3347 , in both the large aperture and the small aperture .",
    "observations that include at least one swp spectrum and one lwp or lwr spectrum were selected . in the combined spectrum ,",
    "the less noisy swp is used up to 1970 , and lwp / lwr is used above 1970 .",
    "where possible , we used the large iue  aperture since the small aperture can suffer from large flux variations during the observation .",
    "iue  bins flagged for bad quality were ignored .",
    "observations that include more than 20  of sequentially flagged data , or more than 60  in total in the wavelength range of interest were omitted from the sample . in cases where several observations exist , we combined spectra bin - by - bin to obtain error - weighted ( 1/@xmath9 ) means and uncertainty of the mean ( 1/@xmath9 added in quadrature ) . in cases where the large aperture data did not comply with",
    "the above set of quality requirements , and small aperture spectra exist , we completed the large aperture spectrum with the small aperture data , using a flux scaling based on the overlap regions .",
    "the combined spectra were fitted between 1600  and 3200 .",
    "we fitted the iue  spectra directly and locally around the 2175  feature using the @xcite stellar - atmospheric spectra , modulated by a power law to represent the broadband extinction , and absorbed by a feature with a drude profile .",
    "the measured flux spectrum @xmath10 as a function of wavelength @xmath11 then takes the following form :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the theoretical stellar spectrum @xcite , @xmath14 is the normalization , and the power law slope is @xmath15 . in the exponent",

    "most stars are fitted extremely well , while the few ( 3/62 ) that are not ( reduced @xmath22 /d.o.f @xmath24 5 ) were eliminated from the sample . in figure [ uvfit ] , we present a typical fit .",

    "this is particularly the case for the stars that have pah mir emission bands , and less so for those that do not .",

    "the standard deviation of 63.9  is large for stars with mir pah emission , and less ( 24.2 ) for those without it .",
    "the present sample has more shifted uv features than previous samples because it was selected differently .",
    "we did not impose any visible extinction requirements , nor assume a standard extinction curve .",
    "in fact , our sample includes many stars with low color excess that fitted locally show a strong uv feature .",
    "in addition , our method allows the stellar metallicity to deviate from solar and thus improve the fit to the observed spectrum .",
    "few early claims in the literature of shifts towards long wavelength of the uv feature attributed it to carbon rich environments around the stars @xcite .",
    "we analyzed the spectra of all of these sources .",
    "the objects hd89353 & hd213985 , discussed by @xcite are included in our sample , and both show strong pah mir emission ( see table  1 ) . on the other hand , the abell 30 planetary nebula @xcite and ry sgr & r crb @xcite do not have significant uv absorption , and as such do not qualify for inclusion in the present sample , nor can they represent regions of the ism where uv absorption can be studied .      the dependence of the pah mir shifts on @xmath7  in fig .",
    "[ mirvst ] corroborates previously published results , as can be seen in figure [ lmirvst ] , where the position of the 7.7@xmath0 m band as a function of @xmath7 continues to increase down to 4kk ( data from * ? ? ?",

    "the present sample extends the trend to higher temperatures and demonstrates that he central wavelength tends to the nominal value of @xmath44 m above 15kk .",

    "note that stellar temperature can not be the only parameter governing the mir shift , as the 7.7 @xmath0 m feature around planetary nebulae ( pne ) , where @xmath7  can reach 100 kk , is also shifted to 7.9 @xmath0 m @xcite .",

    "the dependence of the central wavelength on stellar temperature from the literature @xcite is extended to higher temperatures of up to 37 kk using the present uv selected sample of hot stars . , scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the limitation of the statistical correlation notwithstanding ,",
    "the important result here is that stars whose uv absorption is red - shifted also have red - shifted mir pah bands , both beyond the high-@xmath7  average ( blue data point in fig .  [ uvircor ] ) , suggesting that pahs are responsible for at least the shifted uv absorption .",
    "the correlation presented in figure [ uvircor ] shows that many ir - shifted sources in the sample appear specifically at @xmath45 m .",
    "this feature was identified in proto - planetary disks @xcite and uv - bright pne with large pahs , while here it is found in the weakest uv ( low @xmath7 ) sources .",
    "the scatter in the correlation of figure [ uvircor ] is likely due to more complicated molecular astro - chemistry and the varying circumstellar environments , but the upshot is that stars that feature red - shifted uv absorption also feature red - shifted mir emission bands .",
    "this result , in conjunction with the same pattern of the uv absorption and the mir emission shifting with decreasing stellar temperature , suggests that the uv absorption feature around 2200  is a result of the same molecules that emit the mir bands , and which are believed to be pahs .",
    "longer uv and mir wavelengths indicate larger pah molecules with more than 50 c - atoms @xcite , as can also be seen by comparing , e.g. , cross sections of coronene c@xmath46h@xmath47 vs. circumcoronene c@xmath48h@xmath49 , or ovalene c@xmath50h@xmath51 vs. circumovalene c@xmath52h@xmath53 @xcite .",
    "red - shifted mir bands tend to arise from larger molecules as well , but ionization @xcite , nitrogen atoms in the aromatic rings @xcite , and aliphatic compounds @xcite can also shift their central wavelength .    although pah uv shifts have not been studied systematically , and although several effects can cause mir shifts , the present correlation between the two , and the similar dependence on @xmath7 lends support to the size playing a dominant role .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , larger molecules are present around the cooler stars , but not around the hot ones , with @xmath54kk being the dividing temperature .",
    "both the uv and the mir features start being significantly shifted only below @xmath1kk .",
    "this is the critical temperature for uv - pressure driven stellar winds @xcite .",
    "although one might expect the uv flux from the hot stars to destroy the smaller molecules , this is not what is observed here .",
    "another possible effect of the hot - star winds may have to do with the shocks and the hot ( mk ) x - ray gas that they produce .",
    "if shock heating destroys preferentially the large molecules , it could explain why no uv and mir wavelength shifts are observed in these hot stars , where the nominal wavelengths of 2175  and @xmath42 m may represent normal ism composition of dust grains and normal - size pahs with @xmath5550 c - atoms @xcite .",
    "this speculation remains to be investigated in future studies .",
    "one may wonder if the absorbing and emitting molecules are associated with the background stars , or are they typical of mean ism properties .",
    "the similar behavior of the uv and ir wavelength shifts , as well as the dependence on stellar temperature strongly suggest these features are associated with the host stars .",
    "moreover , we find no correlation between the measured uv @xmath25 and the galactic latitude ( a correlation coefficient of determination r@xmath21 = 0.14 ) , or the ew and the stellar distance ( r@xmath21 = 0.09 ) .",
    "this is in fact expected for the present sample that consists mostly of nearby stars , and for which the measured uv and mir properties are not associated with mean ism values along the random lines of sight .",
    "one can estimate mean ism uv absorption and ir emission based on the expected absorbed and emitted fluxes in the ism @xcite .",
    "the mean ism h number density @xmath56 along a random line of sight can be expected to range between 0.1 to 1.0 @xmath57 . assuming a solar c abundance of c / h@xmath58 , and that 10% of the c is in pahs , the number density of c atoms in pahs is @xmath59 .",
    "the column density towards a star is then the mean density times the distance to the star .",
    "the most distant stars in our sample are @xmath60 2 kpc ( @xmath61 cm ) away , which corresponds to column densities of @xmath62@xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the uv pah absorption cross - section at the center of the feature ( @xmath18 ) is @xmath65 = 10@xmath66 @xmath67 per pah c atom @xcite .",
    "hence , the mean ism optical depth is expected to be @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the distance to the star .",
    "if @xmath70 is the distance measured in pc , one can plug in the numbers and write simply    @xmath71    we were able to find distances to 51 out of the 59 stars in the sample , most of which are closer than 500pc and therefore are not expected to have much ism absorption . in figure [ od ] , we compare the analytic estimate with the optical depth @xmath72 measured from the fitted spectra .",
    "it is demonstrated that all of the current measurements lie much above the line for @xmath73@xmath57 , and all but two stars lie above the line for @xmath74@xmath57 .    in the ir ,",
    "the intensity of the @xmath75 m band per h column density is @xmath76erg s@xmath77 @xmath63str@xmath77 @xcite . using n@xmath78 from above",
    ", the intensity up to 2kpc would be @xmath79ergs@xmath77@xmath63str@xmath77 .",
    "spitzer_/irs spectra we use are reduced from a 20 arcsec@xmath80 extraction ( 4.7 x 10@xmath81 str ) on the sky .",
    "thus , the expected mean ism flux in the @xmath75 m band is    @xmath82    the integrated flux of the feature is approximately @xmath83 .",
    "the measured width ( fwhm ) of the @xmath75 m feature is on average @xmath84 m , or @xmath85 , thus the expected flux of the feature due to the ism emission is @xmath86ergs@xmath77@xmath63 , even for a distant target 2kpc away . for the range of n@xmath87 between 0.1 - 1.0 @xmath57 , we thus obtain @xmath88ergs@xmath77@xmath63 , which is by far weaker than the flux range of @xmath89 to @xmath90ergs@xmath77@xmath63 measured in our sample .",
    "we conclude therefore that the uv and ir measurements towards stars in the present sample can mostly be associated with the stellar environment and not with the random , mean ism properties of the individual lines of sight .",

    "an analytical ( linear ) estimate for @xmath92 is plotted for @xmath73@xmath57 ( lower line ) and for 1.0 @xmath57 ( upper line ) .",
    "the mean ism optical depth is expected to fall between these two lines , demonstrating that the uv absorption measured in the sample is not commensurate with ism absorption and can be mostly ascribed for the most part to the stellar environment.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    [ od ]",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * we find significant shifts of the uv extinction feature around 2200 . *",
    "these shifts become more appreciable as the temperature of the background star decreases below 15kk where hot - star winds cease to exist . *",
    "exactly the same trend of shifts with stellar temperature occurs also in mir pah bands .",
    "* we find the shifts in the uv to correlate with those in the mir , suggesting they both originate in the physical properties of pah molecules .",
    "* one possible reason for the shifts could be molecular size .",
    "these results open new possibilities to diagnose specific molecular species in the ism , which is unattainable in the mir alone , but could be achieved with more uv laboratory and computational experiments .",
    "these could test whether the shifts are due to molecular size .",
    "while the present results associate large pahs preferably with windless , planet - forming stars , the astrophysical setting for the formation and survival of these organic molecules , and their possible connection to the origin of life remains to be investigated .",
    "moreover , our findings will allow one to predict the presence of pahs in the ism and the positions of their mir bands from the uv spectra , and vice versa .",
    "furthermore , the observed variation in the 2175  may be the long sought - after electronic signature of pahs in the uv .",

    "<S> the 2175  uv extinction feature was discovered in the mid-1960s , yet its physical origin remains poorly understood . </S>",
    "<S> one suggestion is absorption by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) molecules , which is supported by theoretical molecular structure computations and by laboratory experiments . </S>",
    "<S> pahs are positively detected by their 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 8.6 , 11.3 & 12.7@xmath0 m ir emission bands , which are specified by their modes of vibration . a definitive empirical link between the 2175  uv extinction , and the pah ir emission bands , however , is still missing . </S>",
    "<S> we present a new sample of hot stars that have both 2175  absorption and pah ir emission . </S>",
    "<S> we find significant shifts of the central wavelength of the uv absorption feature , up to 2350 , but predominantly in stars that also have ir pah emission . </S>",
    "<S> these uv shifts depend on stellar temperature in a fashion that is similar to the shifts of the 6.2 and 7.7@xmath0 m pah ir bands , namely the features are increasingly more red - shifted as the stellar temperature decreases , but only below @xmath1kk . above 15kk both uv and ir features retain their nominal values . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we find a suggestive correlation between the uv and ir shifts . </S>",
    "<S> we hypothesize that these similar dependences of both the uv and ir features on stellar temperature hint to a common origin of the two in pah molecules and may establish the missing link between the uv and ir observations . </S>",
    "<S> we further suggest that the shifts depend on molecular size , and that the critical temperature of @xmath1kk above which no shifts are observed is related to the onset of uv driven hot - star winds and their associated shocks . </S>"
