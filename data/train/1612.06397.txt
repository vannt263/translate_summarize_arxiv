    "electromagnetic collective excitations play an important role in various plasmas @xcite including relativistic ones .",
    "the latter are usually studied in the context of the early universe @xcite , the relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite , and degenerate states of dense matter in compact stars @xcite .",
    "since the low - energy quasiparticle excitations in the recently discovered dirac @xcite and weyl @xcite materials are described by the massless dirac / weyl equations , the properties of their collective effects should resemble those in relativistic plasmas . by taking into account that the massless dirac / weyl quasiparticles carry a well defined chirality , an imbalance between the number densities of opposite chirality carriers could be induced .",
    "such a chiral asymmetry opens the possibility of qualitatively new effects and could modify the properties of collective excitations in the relativistic - like quasiparticle plasma .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the dirac and weyl materials may not only reveal some characteristic properties of truly relativistic forms of matter but also allow one to probe absolutely new quantum effects inaccessible in high - energy physics .",
    "some of them , for example , are connected with the unusual plasma response to a background pseudomagnetic field @xmath0 . unlike an ordinary magnetic field @xmath1 , a pseudomagnetic field @xmath0 couples with different signs to fermions of different chiralities . in weyl and dirac materials ,",
    "the pseudomagnetic field can be induced by various types of strains @xcite . in the case of cd@xmath2as@xmath3 material , for example",
    ", it is estimated that the magnitude of the corresponding field could reach about @xmath4 when a static torsion is applied to a nanowire @xcite and about @xmath5 when a thin film is bent @xcite .",
    "since weyl nodes in condensed matter materials always come in pairs of opposite chirality ( this stems from the nielsen  ninomiya theorem @xcite ) , the pseudomagnetic field by itself does not break the time reversal symmetry in weyl materials .",
    "plasmons are perhaps the best known and characteristic collective excitations in plasma . they are gapped excitations whose minimal energy is determined by the plasma frequency .",
    "recently , we showed @xcite that plasmons in relativistic matter in constant magnetic and pseudomagnetic fields are , in fact , _ chiral _",
    "( pseudo-)magnetic plasmons whose chiral nature is manifested in the oscillations of the chiral charge density , which are absent for ordinary electromagnetic plasmons . moreover",
    ", the constant pseudomagnetic field @xmath6 affects the dependence of plasmon frequencies already in the linear order in the wave - vector .",
    "similar modifications to the energy dispersion of these plasmons can be also induced by the chiral shift parameter @xmath7 ( i.e. , the momentum - space separation of the weyl nodes ) in weyl materials .",
    "interestingly , even in the absence of the chiral shift and external fields , the chiral chemical potential leads to a splitting of the plasmon frequencies in the linear order in the wave vector @xcite .",
    "for a long time it was believed that low frequency electromagnetic waves can not propagate in metals .",
    "however , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite showed that there exist transverse low - energy gapless excitations propagating along the background magnetic field in uncompensated metals ( i.e. , metals with different electron and hole densities ) , which were called helicons .",
    "their counterparts propagating in ionospheres of planets are known as whistlers .",
    "pioneer study of helicons in weyl materials was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that the dispersion law of these collective excitations encodes information on the chiral shift parameter @xmath7 . in this paper , we extend the corresponding study to the case of a background pseudomagnetic field , a nonzero chiral chemical potential , and temperature .",

    "@xcite to the case of weyl materials with a nonzero chiral shift parameter @xmath7 ( odd under time reversal symmetry ) and the energy separation between the weyl nodes @xmath12 ( odd under the parity transformation ) .",
    "moreover , in the presence of pseudo - electromagnetic fields , the consistent formulation of the chiral kinetic theory @xcite is required by the local conservation of the electric charge .",
    "( for similar arguments in the context of quantum field theory , see refs .  @xcite . )",

    "<S> the existence of pseudomagnetic helicons is predicted for strained weyl materials . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding collective modes are similar to the usual helicons in metals in strong magnetic fields but can exist even without a magnetic field due to a strain - induced background pseudomagnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of both pseudomagnetic as well as magnetic helicons are investigated in weyl matter using the formalism of the consistent chiral kinetic theory . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that the helicon dispersion relations are affected by the electric and chiral chemical potentials , the chiral shift , and the energy separation between the weyl nodes . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibrium as well as non - equilibrium regimes of weyl matter are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> a simple setup for experimental detection of pseudomagnetic helicons is proposed . </S>"
