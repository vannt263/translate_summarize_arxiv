    "ly@xmath2 is the most common electronic transition in the universe . most often , it is a product of the photo - ionizing photons emitted by young stars : as recombining electrons cascade through the energy levels , they are funneled into hydrogen s @xmath10 state by the high optical depth of the interstellar medium to lyman series transitions .",
    "the result is that strong ly@xmath2 is a signature of star formation , and indeed , @xcite noted that this feature may be our best probe for identifying galaxies in the act of formation .    due to the resonant nature of the line ,",
    "a typical ly@xmath2 photon must undergo tens or even hundreds of absorptions and re - emissions before escaping into intergalactic space .",
    "consequently , the radiative transfer of this line is quite complex , and even a small amount of dust can break the chain of interactions which is necessary for its escape .",
    "this fact is reflected in the observed redshift evolution of ly@xmath2 emitting galaxies ( laes ) : in the nearby universe , such objects are quite rare , but between @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath12 there is a strong increase in both the number density of ly@xmath2 emitters and their characteristic luminosity @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional radiative transfer models have demonstrated that the ly@xmath2 emission line can contain a great deal of information about the distribution of a galaxy s ism , its surrounding circum - galactic medium , and the physics of its on - going star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , to extract this information , one needs accurate measurements of the fraction of ly@xmath2 photons escaping the galaxy ( ) , and the profile of the emission line .    over the past decade ,",
    "there have been numerous attempts to estimate   in the normal ( non - agn ) galaxies of the distant ( @xmath13 ) universe , mostly by comparing ly@xmath2 to measurements of galactic emission in the rest - frame uv ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the far - infrared @xcite , or the x - ray @xcite . the premise behind these measurements is straightforward : like ly@xmath2 , the strength of a galaxy s uv , far - ir , and x - ray emission all depend in some way on the existence of young stars and star formation .",
    "consequently , the ratio of ly@xmath2 to these quantities should yield a measure how efficiently ly@xmath2 is escaping its environment . using a compilation of such measurements",
    ", @xcite determined that , over time , the `` volumetric '' ly@xmath2 escape fraction of the universe has declined monotonically , from @xmath14 at @xmath15 to @xmath16 locally .",
    "this evolution is consistent with models in which ly@xmath2 is quenched by dust , which slowly builds up as the universe ages .",
    "there is , however , one difficulty with this analysis : all the star - formation rate tracers listed above are somewhat indirect and rely on empirical calibrations derived from galaxies in the local @xmath17 universe . for example",
    ", not only is the observed uv luminosity of a galaxy extremely sensitive to the effects of internal extinction , which may depend on such factors as star formation rate , inclination , and redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it also arises from a stellar population that is slightly different from that which is producing the ionizing photons . although both the uv continuum and ly@xmath2 are generated by the flux from hot , young stars , ly@xmath2 is excited by the far - uv emission of stars with @xmath18 , whereas the uv light originates in the atmospheres of @xmath19 objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the ratio of the two quantities is subject to shifts in the initial mass function , metallicity , extinction law , and the timescale over which star formation is occurring . indeed , @xcite has examined these effects and has shown that , even if both the star - formation rate ( sfr ) and extinction are well determined , measurements of the rest - frame uv in galaxies at @xmath20 will underestimate the flux of ionizing photons by almost a factor of two .    to overcome the need for empirical calibrations , one requires a more direct probe of the ionizing flux from hot , young stars .",
    "since ly@xmath2 is produced by transitions out of the @xmath10 state of hydrogen , the best possible tracer of its intrinsic strength is one which measures the preceding transitions into the @xmath10 state . to date",
    ", only one such investigation of this type has been made in the @xmath13 universe . by performing narrow - band surveys for @xmath21 galaxies in both h@xmath2 and ly@xmath2",
    ", @xcite was able to fix the epoch s volumetric ly@xmath2 escape fraction at @xmath22% .",
    "however , the precision of this measurement was limited by the survey s small volume ( @xmath23  mpc@xmath6 ) , and the dearth of galaxies brighter than @xmath24 .    to improve upon this situation ,",
    "we have combined the data from four recent surveys : 3d - hst and aghast @xcite , the pilot survey for hetdex , the hobby - eberly telescope dark energy experiment ( hps ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the 3727    narrow - band observations of the chandra deep field south ( cdf - s ; * ? ? ?",

    "we describe the observational data and detail the procedures used for identifying and measuring h@xmath0 and ly@xmath2 in our target fields . in section  3",
    ", we use these data to measure ( or place limits on ) the ly@xmath2/h@xmath0 ratio of 73 galaxies in the redshift range @xmath25 . by converting stellar reddenings into nebular extinctions via the empirical @xcite obscuration law ,",
    "we show that the typical ly@xmath2 escape fraction of these galaxies is just a few percent . in section 4 , we consider the epoch s volumetric ly@xmath2 escape fraction by deriving the h@xmath0 and ly@xmath2 luminosity functions for a @xmath5  mpc@xmath26 volume of space . after correcting for nebular h@xmath0 extinction , we demonstrate that , at most , only @xmath7 of the ly@xmath2 photons escape their galaxies , and argue that any systematic error associated with this measurement must be less than @xmath8 .",
    "we conclude by discussing this measurement , and the implications it has for the evolution of galaxies .    for this paper , we assume a @xmath27cdm cosmology , with @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30  km  s@xmath31  mpc@xmath31 @xcite .",

    "this dataset , which is the product of the 3d - hst @xcite and aghast @xcite surveys , consists of @xmath32 slitless spectroscopy over the wavelength range @xmath33 m , and records total emission line fluxes over 625  arcmin@xmath34 of sky .",
    "tens of thousands of spectra are observable on these images , but of special interest are those produced by galaxies in the redshift range @xmath1 , where the emission lines of [ o  ii ] @xmath35 , h@xmath0 , and the distinctively - shaped [ o  iii ] blended doublet @xmath36 are simultaneously present in the bandpass .",
    "for these objects , redshift determinations are unambiguous , and total h@xmath0 fluxes can be measured to a 50% completeness flux limit of @xmath37  ergs  @xmath38  s@xmath31 , independent of redshift .",
    "@xcite has used these data to measure the h@xmath0 fluxes of 260 [ o  ii ] and [ o  iii ] selected galaxies in the goods - s , goods - n @xcite , and cosmos @xcite fields , while @xcite has derived metallicities and masses for these systems .",
    "comparisons with the deep x - ray surveys of the regions @xcite confirm that the vast majority of these objects are normal galaxies with star - formation rates between @xmath39 and @xmath40  yr@xmath31 and no evidence of agn activity @xcite . any h@xmath0 source projected within @xmath41 of a cataloged x - ray position has been excluded from our analysis .",
    "our ly@xmath2 measurements ( and upper limits ) come principally from hps , a blind integral - field spectroscopic study of four areas of sky , including cosmos and goods - n .",

    ", the hps survey covered 169  arcmin@xmath34 , with 107  arcmin@xmath34 in the cosmos and goods - n regions .",
    "roughly 76  arcmin@xmath34 of this area overlaps the fields studied by _",
    "hst , _ with @xmath50 of the overlap region useable for science ( see section  [ subsec : hbeta_lf ] ) .",
    "thus , the intersection of two surveys encompasses a co - moving volume of @xmath51  mpc@xmath6 between @xmath52 .    to compare the hps ly@xmath2 measurements with the h@xmath0 fluxes from the _ hst _ grism , we began by examining the virus - p spectra at the location of every galaxy in the _ hst _ emission - line selected sample .",
    "since the original hps survey ignored all detections below @xmath53 confidence , we re - measured these spectra , mimicking the procedures of @xcite using a @xmath54 radius aperture centered on the position of each h@xmath0 source .",
    "this spectrophotometry did present some challenges .",
    "because the dither pattern of the hps placed roughly two of the @xmath55 diameter fibers at any given position , we had to precisely compute the fraction of each fiber falling within any given aperture .",
    "this calculation was done by summing the total fiber area within the designated aperture and then normalizing the flux by this aperture area .",
    "in addition , although we did have prior knowledge of the approximate redshift of each source , the limited spectral resolution of the _ hst _ grism ( @xmath56 at @xmath20 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) prevented us from knowing the exact wavelength of the corresponding ly@xmath2 line .",
    "we therefore searched a spectral window about the h@xmath0-defined wavelength of ly@xmath2 that was six times the wavelength resolution of the grism , ( @xmath57   ) , summing up the putative ly@xmath2 flux in a series of 4.2     bandpasses ( i.e. , twice the spectral resolution of the instrument ) . the total flux and noise",
    "were then corrected for flux losses due to the fixed spatial and spectral aperture by assuming an effective psf through the @xmath43 fibers of @xmath54 fwhm and adopting an 8    fwhm for the line profile . finally , we searched for sources with a signal - to - noise detection greater than 3 within the spectral bandpass .",
    "this procedure recovered the fluxes of all the @xmath53 ly@xmath2 detections found by @xcite in our h@xmath0 redshift window , and identified one additional h@xmath0 counterpart with a ly@xmath2 @xmath58 of @xmath59 . for the remaining h@xmath0 sources we used the @xmath60 ly@xmath2 limits in our analysis .    to supplement the hps data",
    ", we also used a second source of ly@xmath2 measurements : the deep , narrow - band observations of the extended chandra deep field south .",
    "@xcite imaged this field with the ctio 4-m and mosaic camera for 28.17 hours through a 50    wide interference filter centered at 3727   , and obtained a sample of over 200  ly@xmath2 emitting objects in the redshift range @xmath61 .",
    "[ see @xcite for more details on this dataset . ]",
    "a subset of these sources fall in the goods - s region surveyed by 3d - hst , thus allowing us to increase the number of ly@xmath2 emitters with reliable h@xmath0 constraints .",
    "because these narrow - band observations sample only a small redshift slice of the universe , the actual volume covered by the goods - s data is rather small , just @xmath62  mpc@xmath6 , or @xmath63 that of the overlap region between hps and the fields surveyed by the _ hst _",
    "grism . also , due to the redshift uncertainty associated with the _ hst _ grism measurements , the ly@xmath2 emission from any given h@xmath0 source with @xmath64 may , or may not fall within the narrow - band filter s bandpass .",
    "this ambiguity , plus the flux errors introduced by the filter s gaussian - shaped transmission curve , complicates the interpretation of these photometric measurements .",
    "nevertheless , the narrow - band ly@xmath2 data do reach significantly deeper than the hps spectra ( to a 90% completeness limit of @xmath65  ergs  @xmath38  s@xmath31 ) and are useful , for both probing the faint end of the lae luminosity function , and performing the inverse experiment of measuring  for targets where ly@xmath2 is already detected .    finally , to complete our sample",
    ", we performed a reverse search and examined the _",
    "grism frames for evidence of h@xmath0 emission at the position of known ly@xmath2 sources . for several objects ,",
    "this proved to be impossible due to contamination from overlapping spectra .",
    "however , in a few cases , we were able to extract the h@xmath0 fluxes for the lae candidate , thereby reconfirming its existence . our final sample in the area of hps / hst overlap therefore consists of 54 h@xmath0 emitting galaxies and 13 ly@xmath2 emitters , with four objects detected in both surveys .",
    "the goods - s region contains 24 galaxies with grism - based redshifts between @xmath66 , though only 13 have redshifts that fall within the effective volume surveyed by the gaussian - shaped narrow - band filter ( defined by the filter s full - width at two - thirds maximum ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* for the details of this calculation ) . of the 10 narrow - band selected ly@xmath2 emitters falling within the 3d - hst survey area , 8 have h@xmath0 detections .",
    "a list of these objects appears in table  [ tab : galaxies ] .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : ratio ] compares our _ hst _ h@xmath0 fluxes to ly@xmath2 measurements and limits made via hps spectroscopy .",
    "the measurements are plotted against @xmath0 , the slope of the rest - frame uv continuum between 1250    and 2600   , as derived from the deep multicolor photometry compiled and homogenized by @xcite . also plotted",
    "are the laes found in the goods - s field . from the figure , it is immediately obvious that for most galaxies , ly@xmath2 is below the detection limit of the ground - based surveys .",
    "as stated above , only four of the 54 h@xmath0 emitting galaxies were detected with the hps spectroscopy ; this agrees with the results of @xcite , who found little overlap in the blind samples of ly@xmath2 and h@xmath2 emitters at @xmath67 .",
    "the fraction of ly@xmath2 recoveries is greater for the deeper goods - s data , but since it is not known exactly where these objects fall on the narrow - band filter s transmission curve , the uncertainties associated with their ly@xmath2 fluxes are generally large .",
    "nevertheless , these objects do suggest the existence of an upper limit to the ly@xmath2/h@xmath0 ratios of galaxies .    of course , the values shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : ratio ] do not reflect the true ratio of these emission lines .",
    "before we can use these limits to infer ly@xmath2 escape fractions , we must correct h@xmath0 for the effects of internal extinction . for the dataset under consideration ,",
    "this is not straightforward .",
    "the _ hst _ grism spectra do not extend to @xmath20 h@xmath2 , and h@xmath68 is generally too faint ( and too close in wavelength to h@xmath0 ) to constrain the balmer decrement .",
    "consequently , we have no direct measure of the extinction affecting the objects recombination lines .",
    "we do , however , have access to a measure of _ stellar _ reddening , as each field has deep multicolor photometry that extends throughout the rest - frame uv , from 1250    to 2600    @xcite .",
    "@xcite has shown that over this spectral range , the intrinsic slope of the stellar continuum of star - forming galaxies is very nearly a power law , with @xmath69 . for steady - state star - formation extending over @xmath70  gyr , @xmath71 , while for extremely young starbursts",
    ", @xmath72 may be as steep as @xmath73 .",
    "if the rest - frame uv slope of a star - forming galaxy is observed to be flatter than this value , the most likely explanation is reddening due to dust .",
    "we next need to know how the observed slope of the uv continuum translates into nebular extinction .",
    "as has been noted many times in the literature , the distribution of stars within a galaxy is generally wider than that of the dust , and the latter is often associated with individual h  ii regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , emission - line gas is usually extinguished more than the stars . by observing 8 starburst galaxies in the local universe",
    ", @xcite concluded that @xmath74 and that the slope of the rest - frame uv continuum is related to the total stellar extinction ( in magnitudes ) at 1600     and the total nebular h@xmath0 extinction by @xmath75 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 . without direct measurements of the balmer decrement for large samples of @xmath20 galaxies , it is impossible to confirm this relation for the objects in our sample .",
    "nevertheless , using the same g141 grism data studied here , @xcite showed that , indeed , a power - law fit is good representation of the stellar continuum , and the product @xmath78 is at least consistent with the value of 0.162 expected from the @xcite obscuration relation .",
    "this law is also supported by several recent surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though others have found @xmath79 @xcite . nevertheless , it is reasonable to conclude that a @xcite relation , at least in the statistical sense , is applicable to the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : ratio ] repeats our ly@xmath2/h@xmath0 comparison , but with h@xmath0 corrected for extinction via the @xcite obscuration relation and the assumption that @xmath80 .",
    "these values can easily be translated into escape fractions . under case",
    "b recombination , every ionization results in the creation of a balmer - line photon , with @xmath81 of these photons coming via an @xmath82 to @xmath10 transision ( i.e. , h@xmath0 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "three quarters of these balmer transitions land in a @xmath83 orbital and immediately decay to the ground state via the emission of ly@xmath2 ; the other 25% of the electrons become temporarily trapped in the @xmath84 state before decaying to @xmath85 via two - photon emission .",
    "thus , under normal conditions , the ly@xmath2/h@xmath0 ratio should be @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the case  b recombination coefficient ( @xmath88  cm@xmath6  s@xmath31 at 10,000  k ) and @xmath90 is the effective case b recombination coefficient for h@xmath0 ( @xmath91  cm@xmath6  s@xmath31 at @xmath92  k ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the escape fractions shown in figure  [ fig : ratio ] used @xmath93 as the intrinsic ratio of ly@xmath2 to h@xmath0 . in practice , however , these escape fractions are upper limits . if the case  b condition is relaxed so that the lyman continuum is optically thin , then the ly@xmath2/h@xmath0 ratio may be boosted to values as large as @xmath94 , thereby lowering .",
    "most evidence suggests that at the redshifts considered here , the escape fraction of lyman continuum photons is at most a couple of percent ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this possibility can not be excluded .",
    "similarly , if the ism density approaches @xmath95  cm@xmath26 collisions will redistribute @xmath84 electrons into the @xmath83 state , again enhancing ly@xmath2 relative to h@xmath0 . in the galaxies of the local universe ,",
    "most h  ii regions have electron densities between 1 and 100  cm@xmath26 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though this number may be slightly larger in dwarf systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "shocks or very high densities ( such as in the broad - line regions of agn ) may also increase ly@xmath2 relative to h@xmath0 by creating an environment where the @xmath97 state of neutral material is collisionally populated . finally , our estimates of nebular reddening assume that the observed @xmath20 galaxies have been undergoing vigorous star formation for at least @xmath70  gyr , so that @xmath80 .",
    "since all our grism - selected objects have very high h@xmath0 equivalent widths , the intrinsic slopes of their rest - frame uv continua are unlikely to be flatter than this value @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath72 could be steeper , up to @xmath98 in the extreme , if the systems have only recently begun their star forming activity @xcite . in this case",
    ", our reddening estimates would be underestimated , h@xmath0 would be enhanced , and , once again , our inferred ratios of ly@xmath2 to h@xmath0 would need to be reduced .    in summary ,",
    "our adopted values of @xmath93 and @xmath80 both produce upper limits for the ly@xmath2 escape fraction . any deviations from simple case",
    "b recombination or steady - state star formation will only serve to reduce .",
    "while factor of @xmath99 errors are theoretically possible for systems younger than @xmath99  myr , in most cases , any systematic error associated with our escape fraction measurements should be less than @xmath100 .    as the upper panel of figure  [ fig : ratio ] illustrates , the median h@xmath0 emitter detected by the _ hst _",
    "grism has an escape fraction below 7% , with no statistical difference between the results of the two hps fields .",
    "note that our constraints on   become progressively stronger as the slope of the uv continuum becomes redder .",
    "this is simply the result of our extinction law : as the stellar reddening increases , so does the assumed extinction correction for h@xmath0 .",
    "the implied increase in h@xmath0 then translates into a decreased limit for the ly@xmath2/h@xmath0 ratio .    another way to view the data of figure  [ fig : ratio ]",
    "is through the mathematics of survival analysis @xcite .",
    "several authors have shown that the distribution of ly@xmath2 equivalent widths is exponential in form above a rest - frame equivalent width of @xmath101    @xcite .",
    "if the same is true for ly@xmath2 escape fractions , then the computation of the median escape fraction is straightforward .",
    "the result is a most likely median value of @xmath102% , where the errors are computed via a markov chain monte carlo sampler @xcite . of course ,",
    "since this calculation depends on the underlying shape of the distribution , the formal errors on   underestimate the true uncertainty in the measurement .    perhaps the most instructive way to interpret figure",
    "[ fig : ratio ] is through the geometric parameter @xmath103 , which has been defined by @xcite as the ratio of the optical depth of ly@xmath2 to that of the stellar continuum at 1216   . in objects where resonant scattering is important and",
    "the escape path for ly@xmath2 photons is long , the likelihood of such a photon encountering a dust grain is large and @xmath104 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath105 , ly@xmath2 must have a relatively direct escape route from the galaxy , with a path - length similar to that of the star light",
    ". values of @xmath106 point to either anisotropic emission , a spatial offset between the points of origin for ly@xmath2 and the continuum , a clumpy ism @xcite , or significant deviations from case  b recombination .",
    "the dashed lines figure  [ fig : ratio ] display the @xmath107 and 2 relations under the assumption that a @xcite obscuration relation holds , with @xmath108 .",
    "as expected , most of the sources have upper limits that are larger than @xmath109 , demonstrating that resonant scattering of ly@xmath2 photons within these galaxies is significant .",
    "perhaps as importantly , none of the objects show values of @xmath103 significantly less than one .",
    "several studies have found that luminous ly@xmath2 emitting galaxies tend to cluster about the @xmath109 line ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xcite found that small values of @xmath103 are common in compact , low - mass laes .",
    "but these analyses were for systems selected via their strong ly@xmath2 emission .",
    "the sources analyzed here were primarily chosen via their bright [ o  iii ] ( or [ o  ii ] ) lines . in these more normal star - forming galaxies , @xmath103 is generally greater than one , demonstrating that ly@xmath2 has a difficult time escaping its immediate environment .",
    "an alternative approach to exploring the escape fraction of ly@xmath2 photons from the @xmath20 universe is to do so globally , via a comparison of the h@xmath0 and ly@xmath2 luminosity functions . the @xmath5  mpc@xmath6 volume of space surveyed for both h@xmath0 and ly@xmath2 contains 67 galaxies detected in h@xmath0 and 23 identifiable via ly@xmath2 .",
    "these numbers are more than sufficient for defining the emission - line luminosity functions of the two galaxy populations and integrating for their total luminosity density .      in order to calculate the @xmath20 h@xmath0 luminosity function , we must first estimate the effective area of overlap between the hps and the _ hst _ grism observations .",
    "this is not just a simple geometry problem , since , as with all slitless spectroscopy , overlapping sources render a fraction of the survey area unusable .",
    "@xcite estimated this fraction via a series of monte carlo experiments , in which realistic magnitude and positional distributions were used to create simulated frames , which were then `` observed '' in the same manner as the original data . at each point on the simulated frames , the amount of contamination",
    "was compared to the local sky noise , and all regions where the systematics of spectral subtraction were greater than this noise were excluded from consideration . since sky noise is the dominant source of uncertainty for all @xmath20 observations , this procedure generated a reliable statistical measure of the grism survey s effective area .",
    "based on the results of these simulations , we reduced the geometric hps / hst overlap region by 15% to 65  arcmin@xmath34 , and used this new area in our calculation of survey volume .    to measure the total h@xmath0 luminosity density at @xmath20 , we began by following the procedures described by @xcite and applied the @xmath110 technique @xcite to the h@xmath0 sources found in cosmos , goods - n , and goods - s .",

    "we began with the assumption that over the redshift range @xmath25 , the h@xmath0 luminosity function can be modeled via a @xcite law @xmath118 with @xmath24 being the characteristic monochromatic luminosity of the epoch .",
    "the observed function , of course , does not follow this relation , as incompleteness takes an ever increasing toll at fainter fluxes .",
    "hence we define @xmath119 as the schechter function modified by the flux - dependent completeness fraction at each redshift as given by @xcite . from poissonian statistics ,",
    "the probability of observing @xmath120 galaxies in any given luminosity and volume interval @xmath121 is then @xmath122 where the expectation value @xmath123 .",
    "if we let these intervals become differentials , then the likelihood of drawing an observed set of @xmath124 h@xmath0 luminosities from a given schechter function with parameters @xmath24 , @xmath125 , and @xmath2 becomes @xmath126 where , for purposes of our analysis , we define the lower limits of the luminosity integral by where the completeness fraction drops to 50% .",
    "the top right panel of figure  [ fig : lf ] displays the likelihood contours in @xmath24 and @xmath125 , with the faint - end slope fixed at @xmath127 for consistency with other studies @xcite . to avoid the well - known degeneracy between @xmath24 and @xmath125 , the ordinate of the plot gives the integral of the schechter function ( down to @xmath128  ergs  s@xmath31 ) , rather than the traditional coefficient , @xmath125 .",
    "the most likely solution , with @xmath129 and @xmath130  mpc@xmath26 , is displayed in the top left of figure  [ fig : lf ] . for comparison , the most likely h@xmath0 luminosity function for the full sample of @xmath1 _",

    "although this latter quantity does require the extrapolation of the @xcite function to zero luminosity , this extension is not an important issue , as galaxies below our detection threshold are predicted to contribute only @xmath134 to the universe s total h@xmath0 luminosity density . for reference ,",
    "table  [ tab : lf ] also lists the h@xmath0 luminosity function parameters for the entire @xmath1 grism survey region of cosmos and goods . although this full volume is roughly four times larger than that for the just the regions of survey overlap , the luminosity function defined by its galaxies is virtually identical to that of the smaller region .",
    "the likelihoods given in table  [ tab : lf ] and displayed in figure  [ fig : lf ] represent only the formal statistical error of our fit .",
    "not included are systematic uncertainties associated with the data themselves , most notably , with the completeness corrections .",
    "our estimates for the survey area and completeness fraction are based on the simulations performed by @xcite , who also confirmed that metallicity , equivalent width , and redshift are not important factors for determining the detectability of h@xmath0 .",
    "this analysis did not , however , take galaxy size into account , and this can be an important factor for slitless spectroscopic surveys . fortunately , for the dataset considered here , the effect is minor .",
    "as @xcite have shown , @xmath135 of massive ( @xmath136 ) late - type galaxies at @xmath137 have effective radii smaller than @xmath138 , while all the h@xmath0 galaxies analyzed here have @xmath139 @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the completeness of an _ hst _ grism survey is a very weak function of size ( see the analysis of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the simulations of @xcite should be valid . based on this result , our calculation of survey area and incompleteness fraction likely carries an additional error of @xmath140 .    similarly , because the _ hst _ survey fields are relatively small , the effects of cosmic variance on our luminosity functions are non - negligible .",
    "we can estimate this number using the cosmic variance calculator developed by @xcite , which combines press - schechter theory with n - body cosmological simulations to predict field - to - field fluctuations in arbitrary slices ( or pencil beams ) of the universe . according to this estimator",
    ", our number counts in the three _ hst _ fields carry an additional uncertainty of @xmath141 , while that for just the 65  arcmin@xmath34 region of overlap between the _ hst-_grism surveys and our two sets of ground - based ly@xmath2 observations is @xmath134 . of course , for estimates of the ly@xmath2 escape fraction , it is the field - to - field variations of galactic properties such as star formation rate and dust content which are the important parameters for the calculation , not simply the number of galaxies present in the region .",
    "while we are less able to quantify this number , it seems likely that the effect is significantly less than @xmath134 .",
    "the last piece of information needed to compute the h@xmath0 luminosity density of the @xmath20 universe is an estimate of h@xmath0 attenuation . once again , we are limited by the lack of direct knowledge of the galaxies nebular extinction .",
    "measurements of the balmer decrement in the @xmath20 universe are rare , especially for samples of emission - line selected galaxies .",
    "( the closest comparison sample to our own  that created by @xcite from 128 wfc3 grism - selected galaxies in the @xmath142 universe  has very large uncertainties , with a mean value of @xmath143  dex . )",
    "consequently , we must again compute the loss of h@xmath0 statistically from measurements of the stellar continuum .",
    "we did this by translating the uv slopes of each h@xmath0 source in our sample into a nebular extinction using the obscuration relations of @xcite , and then examining the distribution of these extinctions .",
    "if we just consider the sample of 42 galaxies in the region of space surveyed for h@xmath0 and ly@xmath2 , then the median logarithmic extinction at h@xmath0 is @xmath144 , while the effective extinction , defined via the total amount of h@xmath0 luminosity lost due to dust in all the galaxies , is @xmath145 .",
    "for comparison , the logarithmic extinctions found for all @xmath146 galaxies brighter than the 50% h@xmath0 completeness limit in the _ hst _ fields of cosmos , goods - n , and goods - s is @xmath147 ( median ) and @xmath148 ( effective ) .",
    "this difference between the median and effective attenuation is not unexpected : as noted by many authors , reddening is strongly correlated with stellar mass and therefore star - formation rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the brightest h@xmath0 emitters are also those most heavily extinguished by dust , the effective extinction of the sample should be larger than the median extinction .",
    "for the remainder of this paper , we will adopt @xmath4 as the total logarithmic extinction at h@xmath0 , while noting that the uncertainty on this number is likely to be @xmath149  dex .",
    "the resulting intrinsic h@xmath0 luminosity density and total error for the @xmath20 universe is then @xmath150 ( ergs  s@xmath31  mpc@xmath26 ) .",
    "our h@xmath0 luminosity function is the first such measurement at @xmath13 .",
    "however , there have been previous estimates of the epoch s h@xmath2 luminosity function from deep , narrow - band surveys in the infrared . while @xcite found @xmath151 ( ergs  s@xmath31 ) and a total h@xmath2 luminosity density of @xmath152 ( ergs  s@xmath31",
    "mpc@xmath26 ) in a 56  arcmin@xmath34 region of goods - s , a much larger ( @xmath99  deg@xmath34 ) study by @xcite inferred @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "our best - fit h@xmath0 function , coupled with an effective logarithmic extinction of @xmath4 , a @xcite extinction law ( with @xmath155 ) and an assumed intrinsic h@xmath2/h@xmath0 ratio of 2.86 @xcite implies observed values for @xmath24 and the h@xmath2 luminosity density of @xmath156 ( ergs  s@xmath31 ) and @xmath157 ( ergs  s@xmath31  mpc@xmath26 ) . in other words ,",
    "our measurement of @xmath24 is in good agreement with that of @xcite , but our estimated luminosity density is more in line with that found by @xcite .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that these three surveys differ by more than 0.3  dex in their determination of luminosity density , but given the small volumes involved ( 5440 , 77,000 , and 108,000  mpc@xmath6 for the @xcite , @xcite , and this survey , respectively ) , and the expected cosmic variance in the number counts ( @xmath158 , and 20% ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the result is still reasonable .",
    "we can also test our measurement of the h@xmath0 luminosity function by converting it into a star formation rate . the observed h@xmath0 luminosity density in our _ hst _ fields",
    "is @xmath159 ( ergs  s@xmath31  mpc@xmath26 ) .",
    "if we again de - redden this number by @xmath4 and assume an intrinsic h@xmath2/h@xmath0 ratio of 2.86 , then @xmath160 ( ergs  s@xmath31  mpc@xmath26 ) .",
    "the application of the local h@xmath2 star - formation rate calibration @xcite then yields @xmath161 ( @xmath162  yr@xmath31  mpc@xmath26 ) where the error is dominated by the uncertainty in the reddening correction .",
    "this value is generally consistent with most other determinations of the epoch s star - formation rate density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although , as pointed out above , it is slightly lower than that found from the h@xmath2 observations of @xcite .",
    "to compute the volumetric ly@xmath2 escape fraction of the @xmath20 universe , we repeated the above analysis using the ly@xmath2 emitting galaxies found in our overlapping survey area .",
    "for the hps objects , this involved using the estimates of completeness versus line flux computed by @xcite for the 186 separate virus - p pointings covering the _ hst-_grism fields in cosmos and goods - n ; for the narrow - band data , the completeness fraction versus monochromatic flux relation was based on the artificial star experiments performed by @xcite on the region s deep mosaic images .",
    "these functions were then folded into the @xmath110 calculation of equation  ( [ eq : vmax ] ) and the luminosity function was fit using the maximum - likelihood procedures described by equation  ( [ eq : likelihood ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : lf ] and summarized in table  [ tab : lf ] . because our survey fields contain far fewer laes than h@xmath0 galaxies , the ly@xmath2 luminosity function is not as well defined as its h@xmath0 counterpart .",
    "indeed , only 11 hps galaxies and 6 narrow - band selected objects have ly@xmath2 detections that are brighter than their frame s 50% completeness limit . as a result ,",
    "the `` knee '' of the @xcite function is poorly defined and detected only with @xmath163 significance .",
    "nevertheless , the best fit function , with @xmath164 ( ergs  s@xmath31 ) and @xmath165 ( mpc@xmath26 ) , is similar to that found by @xcite for the entire sample of 49 non - x - ray - emitting hps laes with @xmath166 .",
    "our @xmath20 value of @xmath167 is significantly larger that those found by narrow - band surveys @xcite , but , given the vastly larger volume studied by the hps and the increased likelihood of finding rare , exceptionally bright objects , this difference is not a serious concern .    despite the rather large uncertainty associated with @xmath167 , the total ly@xmath2 luminosity density of the @xmath20 universe ,",
    "as defined through equation  ( [ eq : sch_int ] ) , is very well defined , with @xmath168  ( ergs  s@xmath31  mpc@xmath26 ) .",
    "this number is a slight underestimate , since , unlike the _ hst _ grism , the hps and the narrow - band surveys do not unambiguously identify every ly@xmath2 source above a flux limit .",
    "to be classified as an lae , a galaxy must also have a rest - frame equivalent width greater than 20   .",
    "( lower equivalent width objects can be confused with foreground sources and are usually ignored . ) to correct for these missing objects , one must estimate the total amount of emission associated with low - equivalent width galaxies .",
    "if the equivalent width distribution of such objects follows the exponential function defined by the higher ew laes , then our census may be missing between 20% and 30% of escaping ly@xmath2 photons @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "if , as suggested by @xcite , the true distribution of ly@xmath2 equivalent widths has a lognormal form similar to that associated with local [ o  ii ] emitting galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then the missing ly@xmath2 flux would be far less . since observations of lyman - break galaxies appear to support the former possibility ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we use this more conservative approach in our calculations and assume that we are missing @xmath134 of the epoch s total ly@xmath2 luminosity density .",
    "figure  [ fig : escape_prb ] combines our two likelihood functions to show the total ly@xmath2 escape fraction within our @xmath5  mpc@xmath6 survey volume . in the figure ,",
    "the most probable escape fraction for the @xmath20 universe is @xmath7 , with the bulk of our statistical error arising from the uncertainty in the ly@xmath2 luminosity function .",
    "we must note , however , that the systematic errors associated with our measurement may be greater than this . while our assumptions about case  b recombination , the history of @xmath20 star formation , and the population of low equivalent width ly@xmath2 emitters suggest that our measurement of   is an upper limit",
    ", the greatest uncertainty is that associated with internal extinction .",
    "as mentioned above , none of the objects studied in this program have measured balmer decrements ; instead , we have estimates of the stellar reddenings derived from the observed slopes of the rest - frame uv continua .",
    "these are , at best , indirectly related to the nebular extinctions applicable to our problem @xcite . to produce figure  [ fig : escape_prb ] ,",
    "we have assumed @xmath4 , but this number likely has an uncertainty of @xmath149  dex .",
    "this factor adds an additional @xmath8 error onto our estimate , making our systematic error term comparable to our statistical uncertainty .",
    "our estimate of @xmath7 for the ly@xmath2 escape fraction is consistent with the study by @xcite , who normalized their @xmath166 lae observations via rest - frame uv measurements of the epoch s star formation rate density .",
    "it also agrees with most models for the evolution of  with redshift @xcite .",
    "but these analyses rely predominantly on indirect measurements : in fact , the only previous study to directly compare ly@xmath2 emission with ly@xmath2 production is that of @xcite . by performing dual narrow - band surveys in ly@xmath2 and h@xmath2 , and estimating nebular extinction via the reddening of the stellar rest - frame uv continuum ,",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath22% as the ly@xmath2 escape fraction for the @xmath67 universe .",
    "our @xmath25 measurements , which also rely on stellar reddenings , encompass a volume @xmath101 times larger than that of the @xcite survey , and are therefore far less sensitive to issues associated with cosmic variance .",
    "more importantly , by surveying this larger volume , we have been able to better define the bright end of the ly@xmath2 and h@xmath0 luminosity functions . while our data are not as good as those of @xcite for defining the slope of the faint - end of the luminosity function ( we adopt @xmath127 , rather than fitting for the variable ) , we have many more @xmath169 galaxies , and , unless the @xcite function has a very steep , faint - end slope , it is this latter parameter which is most important for defining the total emission - line flux",
    "of course , our observations also have the drawback of being based on h@xmath0 , rather than h@xmath2 , and are thus more sensitive to the effects of dust and internal extinction than the previous study .    at present , our measurements of  are limited by two factors : the depth of our survey for ly@xmath2 , and our ability to estimate @xmath170 for individual galaxies",
    ". both of these issues should improve rather rapidly .",
    "at the wavelengths considered here , the hps typically reached a monochromatic flux limit of @xmath171  ergs  @xmath38  s@xmath31 , or @xmath172  ( ergs  s@xmath31 ) at @xmath21 .",
    "unfortunately , as shown in figure  [ fig : ratio ] , this is not deep enough to detect many of the emission - line galaxies found by the _ hst _ grism , as our median upper limit on the ly@xmath2 escape fraction is @xmath3 . in other words ,",
    "our detection threshold lies just above that expected from our analysis of the epoch s volumetric escape fraction .",
    "the main hetdex survey , which begins in 2015 , is designed to reach ly@xmath2 flux limits that are a factor of @xmath173 fainter than that for the hps , i.e. , @xmath174  ergs  @xmath38  s@xmath31 at @xmath175   .",
    "this limit should allow us to directly measure   for the typical star - forming galaxy of the epoch , and enable a search for trends with object size , stellar mass , and star formation rate .    similarly , our ability to measure the intrinsic balmer line luminosities of the h@xmath0-selected galaxies is rapidly advancing .",
    "like most previous studies of ly@xmath2 emission at @xmath176 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our estimates of nebular extinction are inferred from measurements of stellar reddening , and , while there may be a relation between the two parameters , this unknown does introduce an uncertainty into the calculation .",
    "fortunately , instruments are now available which allow simultaneous infrared spectroscopy for large numbers of @xmath20 sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thereby enabling direct measurements of the galaxies balmer decrements .",
