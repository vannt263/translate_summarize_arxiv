    "phase transitions in strongly interacting matter have been a subject of intense theoretical , computational and experimental research over the past decades .",
    "apart from the physical values of the qcd parameters , a lot of effort has been devoted to understand different limits of the theory as the mass parameters values , numbers of colors and flavors are varied .",
    "several qualitative and in some cases quantitative aspects have been revealed : for example , we know that in the absence of quarks the @xmath0 yang - mills theory has a global @xmath1 symmetry @xcite , and there exists a gauge invariant operator charged under @xmath1 , the polyakov loop , which can be identified as the order parameter of the theory . hence , the deconfinement phase transition can be easily characterized using the universality arguments @xcite .",
    "numerical studies have confirmed this picture as it has been found that the deconfinement phase transition is second order when the number of colors is @xmath2 @xcite , first order for @xmath3 @xcite ( although weakly @xcite ) , and presumably first order for @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "adding quarks to the theory changes the picture considerably .",
    "for light fermions in the fundamental and pseudoreal representations for @xmath3 and @xmath2 , respectively , the corresponding @xmath5 or @xmath6 the center of the gauge group is not a good symmetry .",
    "however , the exact chiral symmetry of massless fermions is only little perturbed by small masses and the order parameter is the chiral condensate which characterizes the chiral phase transition . for @xmath7=3 and two massless quark flavors at finite temperature and zero net baryon density ,",
    "the chiral phase transition is in the same universality class as the three dimensional @xmath8 spin model @xcite , becoming a smooth crossover as small quark masses are accounted for @xcite .",
    "for @xmath9 the relevant universality class is that of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "in addition to finite temperature , one can also study the response of the qcd vacuum by considering finite net quark densities . at finite",
    "chemical potential one needs to take into account the pairing phenomena and superconducting phases result .",
    "however , a systematic approach based on the full qcd dynamics can be applied only in asymptotic densities @xcite where asymptotic freedom simplifies the analysis . to determine the phases at intermediate densities relevant for phenomenological applications one needs to resort to effective models . within the model studies taking into account the patterns of chiral symmetry breaking ,",
    "one usually hopes to gain insight on the qualitative aspects of the phase diagram .",
    "studies within different models have revealed that in cold dense matter , a first order phase transition to a superconducting phase characterized by nonzero diquark condensate takes place .",
    "contrasting this with the finite temperature crossover transition at @xmath11 one concludes that in the @xmath12-plane there must exist a critical endpoint .",
    "a central paradigm for the first principle studies of the qcd equation of state @xcite over the @xmath12-plane is therefore the existence , location and other properties of this critical point .",
    "the lattice determinations using different techniques have provided estimates for the location of the critical point . for two flavors see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the existence of the critical point in three flavor qcd is currently debatable , @xcite , and in any case one should be careful in drawing any conclusions from @xmath13 results to the physical 2 + 1 case .    the perturbative calculations for cold quark matter at asymptotically large chemical potential or for hot quark gluon gas at high temperature can not be directly applied to the phenomenologically relevant densities and temperatures . at finite temperature",
    "the perturbation expansion is known to converge poorly and reliable results can be obtained only at near - zero chemical potential well above the suitably defined transition temperature @xmath14 , where the picture of weakly interacting dressed quark and gluon quasiparticles becomes correct . to address quantitative phenomenology for all temperatures at zero net quark density , a numerical `` recipe '' for interpolating smoothly between thermodynamics described by perturbation theory at high temperatures and by a resonance gas at low temperatures",
    "was proposed in @xcite , taking also into account the contribution of quarks with finite masses .",
    "this approach provides one with a working definition of @xmath15 and of the resulting thermodynamics , but it does not yield insight to the nature of the underlying effective degrees of freedom and mechanisms responsible for the dynamics between the thermally dressed hot quarks and gluons and low temperature hadronic resonances .    in this work we concentrate on the case of qcd with two light quark flavors and study a particular effective model description of it . this effective model is based on the following picture : as a function of the quark mass there exist two separate dynamical sectors .",
    "for massless quarks there is spontaneous breaking of exact chiral symmetry , while if the quarks are very heavy , and decouple from the dynamics , the center symmetry and its spontaneous breaking becomes relevant . in real qcd",
    "neither of these two is exact .",
    "lattice calculations indicate that for quarks with finite masses , the transition is a smooth crossover as is also expected on the basis of universality arguments , and the transition can be located by measuring the expectation value of the chiral condensate .",
    "however , even if the discrete symmetry associated with deconfinement is broken by the presence of light quarks , one can still study the temperature dependence of the polyakov loop on the lattice .",
    "this has been done , and one observes the polyakov loop to rise from zero to one as temperature is increased from low to high values . due to this behavior one also speaks of deconfining phase transition @xcite .",
    "moreover , the lattice results @xcite indicate that at zero chemical potential chiral symmetry breaking and confinement ( i.e. a decrease of the polyakov loop ) occur at the same critical temperature . several attempts to explain these behaviors exist @xcite . relying only on the exact and approximate symmetries of the system and general effective field theory methods a qualitative solution to this puzzle",
    "was established in @xcite based on the idea of transfer of information from the order parameters to non - critical fields . as a function of quark mass , from light to heavy quarks",
    ", this mechanism allows one to treat either chiral symmetry or center symmetry as the relevant one driving the transition and through interactions allowing also the other would - be - order parameter field to behave in a similar way .",
    "the framework proposed in @xcite also explains the independence of deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration in the case of adjoint quarks which do not break the center symmetry . the @xmath12 phase diagram for adjoint two color qcd was considered in detain in @xcite .",
    "this behavior has been reanalysed and confirmed in numerical studies of njl model and linear sigma model coupled to the polyakov loop via quarks which are integrated out in the random phase approximation @xcite . in this work",
    "we study the coupling of polyakov loop and chiral degrees of freedom described either with a linear sigma model or njl model , and compare the resulting thermodynamics to that of two flavor qcd .",
    "inclusion of the polyakov loop makes the result qualitatively , and to some extent , even quantitatively insensitive to the underlying model used to describe the chiral degrees of freedom at finite temperature and small values of quark chemical potential .",
    "the importance of the polyakov loop is not surprising , since the gluonic degrees of freedom are known to be important for the bulk thermodynamics of qcd matter when the net baryon densities are small .",
    "we consider also finite densities , and show that quantitative discrepancy between the two models increases as larger values of chemical potential are considered .",
    "to display this concretely , we determine the location of the critical point in @xmath12-plane and show how the two models lead to very different results .",
    "the effective models studied here , may provide input to the phenomenology of relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "recently , with the advent of rhic data , it has been established that the spacetime evolution of the hot dense qcd matter is well described by nearly ideal hydrodynamics .",
    "this means in particular that the system evoles along the lines of constant @xmath16 .",
    "hence , we study in particular the behavior of isentropic lines in the @xmath12 phase diagram in these two models . whether these have",
    "the tendency to focus on the critical point is important for the possible experimental discovery of the critical point in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we find that in these models strong focusing behavior does not exist .",
    "we introduce the models in some detail in section [ section_models ] , and carry out an analysis of the thermodynamics in section [ section_termo ] . comparing these models at zero chemical potential , we find that they imply very similar results .",
    "we also compare with the results of the resummed perturbation theory @xcite . at finite chemical potential",
    "we find that the quantitative results of the models show large deviations .",
    "especially the location of the qcd critical point can not be estimated reliably within these models .",
    "we end with concluding remarks and discussion of further prospects in section [ section_checkout ] .",
    "the chiral dynamics of two - flavor qcd is often formulated in terms of a linear or non - linear sigma model , which treats the goldstone bosons as the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "of these two possibilities , the linear representation is more useful to study the finite temperatures and densities in order to find the phase diagrams of the theory , since also the order parameter is included explicitly .",
    "yet another possibility is to treat the fundamental fermion fields as basic degrees of freedom , the mesons appearing as the bound states of the theory , and this leads to nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) -models .",
    "the effects of small quark masses are taken into account in the effective model lagrangians by terms explicitly breaking chiral symmetry .",
    "these terms , appearing with small coefficients , render the chiral symmetry of the theory only approximate . both of the above mentioned effective models for the phenomenology of two flavor qcd can be parametrized to describe equally well the vacuum structure at @xmath17 .",
    "finite temperature dynamics of @xmath0 pure gauge theory on the other hand is represented by @xmath1 symmetric effective theory for which the order parameter is the polykov loop .",
    "polyakov loop can be constructed and studied also in a theory with quarks eventhough the presence of fermions in the fundamental representation of the gauge group breaks the center symmetry explicitly due to the antiperiodic boundary conditions of the fermion fields at finite temperature .",
    "therefore , in real qcd neither chiral symmetry or the center symmetry is exact , and we know that the finite temperature phase transition at @xmath11 is a smooth crossover",
    ". however , one may ask which of the two symmetries is more accurate and would act as a `` driving force '' for the transition . since chiral symmetry breaking is proportional to @xmath18 , and @xmath1",
    "breaking is proportional to @xmath19 , in the case of two light flavors , it seems natural to consider the system to have an approximate chiral symmetry .",
    "this expectation is strenghtened also by looking at the spectrum of the bound states , as the pions clearly show the approximate goldstone behavior . based on these motivations , in @xcite",
    "the situation was considered taking the @xmath20 limit in which the chiral symmetry becomes exact , while the @xmath1 symmetry is completely broken .",
    "then the general principles of effective theory dictate a following form for the potential @xmath21={\\mathcal{l}}_0[\\sigma,\\pi^a]+{\\mathcal{l}}_0[\\phi]+ { \\mathcal{l}}_{\\rm{int}}[\\sigma,\\pi^a,\\phi],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 $ ] is the chiral lagrangian which has exact chiral symmetry , @xmath23 $ ] is the potential for the polyakov loop and contains both @xmath1 symmetric and symmetry violating terms and finally @xmath24 is the part containing the interactions between the chiral fields and the polyakov loop .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the most important term for the dynamics is @xmath25 , which leads to transfer of information between the order parameter and a non - order parameter field .",
    "when quark mass is increased away from the chiral limit , the transition becomes a smooth crossover , but the coincidence of the chiral symemtry restoration and deconfinement is expected as long as chiral symmetry remains good approximation .    on the other hand one can consider infinitely heavy quarks , i.e. the pure gauge limit .",
    "then the mechanism described above works similarly , but the roles of chiral symmetry and center symmetry are switched and the deconfinement order parameter drives the change of the chiral condensate . again",
    "the two phenomena will coincide .",
    "decreasing the quark mass from the pure gauge limit , the first order deconfinement line is expected to terminate at a critical point a some value of quark mass and for smaller values become a smooth crossover . since lattice investigations find coincidence of critical temperatures related to chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement for the accessible quark masses , it is reasonable to expect that there is a single phase border in @xmath26 plane interpolating between these well known small and large quark mass behaviors .",
    "the results of @xcite can be applied to understand the behaviors near either small or large quark mass critical points .",
    "for intermediate values , more specific model studies or first principle lattice calculations are needed .",
    "in @xcite a specific model framework claimed applicable for all values of @xmath18 was proposed . in this work",
    "we study this framework in detail .",
    "we consider , side - by - side , both the njl model and the linear sigma model ( lsm ) for two mass - degenerate quark flavors coupled to the polyakov loop .",
    "the important feature underlying the dynamics in the approaches @xcite is the assumption of independent deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration described by the order parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , and having independent effective potentials , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , connected by interactions between the two .",
    "the central further assumption , then , is that the proposed interaction term yields the correct form for the resulting effective potential at all values of the quark mass , i.e. interpolates correctly between the limits of exact center symmetry and exact chiral symmetry hence describing also correctly the behaviors at the point @xmath31 , corresponding to real two - flavor qcd .",
    "we aim to test this underlying assumption in detail by cartographing the thermodynamics of these models over the @xmath12 plane and study in quantitative detail these two models against each other as well as against the numerical knowledge of real two - flavor qcd at zero net quark density .",
    "let us start by describing the details of the models we use . to derive the grand canonical potential",
    ", we consider the following lagrangian    @xmath32    where we have separated the contributions of chiral degrees of freedom and the polyakov loop . the part @xmath33 is for the linear sigma model and njl model , respectively , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the light quark field , @xmath36 the bare quark mass ( @xmath37 , i.e exact isospinis assumed ) , @xmath28 and @xmath38 constitute a chiral field @xmath39 and finally @xmath40 .",
    "we work under the mean field approximation , hence the kinetic term of the chiral field is neglected in ( [ lsm_lagrangian ] ) and the four - fermion interaction of the njl - model lagrangian has been linearized in the condensate in ( [ njl_lagrangian ] ) .",

    "namely , lattice data implies a critial temperature @xmath76 mev , a value @xmath77% lower than we obtain . in @xcite",
    "it has been noted that better agreement can be achieved in pnjl model by detuning the polyakov loop potential away from the pure gauge thermodynamics through shifting of the parameter @xmath78 down to 190 mev .",
    "since the lattice data has still some uncertainty to it due to the extrapolation to continuum limit , we choose not to aim for perfect fits and rather plot the thermodynamical quantities as a function of @xmath79 when comparing different models .",

    "this peak arises since @xmath98 is proportional to heat capacity which diverges in a second order phase transition .",
    "another issue present in the temperature dependence of @xmath98 is a small second peak visible very weakly in pnjl model but more strongly in plsm model .",
    "this is due to the remnant of the deconfinement transition described by the temperature dependence of the parameters in the polyakov loop potential .",

    "note that at finite chemical potential @xmath27 and @xmath102 are no more equal . at large chemical potentials we observe that already at first derivatives of the condensates a double peak structure arises .",
    "this is due to the fact that as chemical potential is increased , the critical temperature in the chiral sector decreases as shown by the location of the leftmost peak in the figures , while the remnant of the deconfinement transition in the polyakov loop potential is unaffected by the value of the chemical potential and remains visible at temperature @xmath103 mev .",
    "as the two distinct transitions underlying these effective models are separated over wider temperature range their separate features become also more visible .",
    "hence , this provides another way to numerically investigate the correctness of the initial assumption of independent deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration underlying these models .    -0.4truecm",
    "-0.4truecm    we show the @xmath12 phase diagram in fig .",

    "various effective theory estimates deviate a lot when finite chemical potentials are considered .",
    "the lattice determinations using different techniques also lead to very different results for the location of the critical point . for example , for two flavors the authors of @xcite find the critical point at @xmath106 mev while in @xcite a value @xmath107 mev is reported .",
    "currently the existence of the critical point is debatable @xcite , and in any case one should be careful in drawing any conclusions from @xmath13 results to the physical 2 + 1 case .    with these remarks in mind ,",
    "let us assume that the critical point in the @xmath12 plane exists as implied by these effective theories .",
    "then , even if the exact location of the critical point is not exactly known , one may argue in favor of its experimental detection if the spacetime evolution of the strongly interacting elementary particle matter is such that the system passes through the vicinity of the critical point starting from almost any initial condition .",
    "the outcomes of such _ focusing _ behavior have been recently advocated for in @xcite strongly motivated by @xcite .",
    "however , the focusing observed in @xcite can be due to the particular equation of state applied in that work and is not a general feature of hydrodynamics approach applied successfully to describe the rhic data as in e.g. @xcite . given the success of ideal fluid hydrodynamics in the description of the rhic data , it is likely that the system expands nearly isentropically .",
    "therefore , to decide if the focusing behavior in the models studied here should occur , we find the adiabats of plsm and pnjl models in the @xmath12 plane . the result is shown in figs [ isentropes_plsm ] and [ isentropes_pnjl ] , and the conclusion for both of these models is negative .",
    "based on these figures we conclude that for the hydrodynamical evolution starting from a near zero net quark density , as would be the case in a central au+au collision at rhic , the trajectory of the system in @xmath12-plane is non - focusing .",
    "as the closeups in the right panels of figs [ isentropes_plsm ] and [ isentropes_pnjl ] show , there is no special behavior near the critical points .",
    "this result is similar to the one obtained on the lattice @xcite .    -0.4truecm    -0.4truecm    -0.4truecm    another interesting quantity is the sound speed shown in fig . [ sound_speed ] for chemical potentials near the critical one .",
    "the stronger dependence of the location of the minimum in @xmath108 as a function of the chemical potential in pnjl model is due to the fact that near the critical point the value of @xmath109 changes more rapidly than in the case of plsm model . together with figs .",
    "[ isentropes_plsm ] and [ isentropes_pnjl ] we see from here that in the hydrodynamical evolution the sound speed is very small during the part of the evolution the system spends near the phase transition region . at @xmath12 regions relevant for rhic and lhc / alice phenomenology ,",
    "the sound speed is probably well approximated by the @xmath11 result as the system evolves very close to the @xmath110 axis along a nearly parallel trajectory until low temperatures deep in the hadronic phase are reached and the trajectory bends to end at the finite value @xmath111 at zero temperature .",
    "however , if it was possible to create systems which would follow the trajectory bending along the phase boundary as the ones at large chemical potential in figs [ isentropes_plsm ] and [ isentropes_pnjl ] , then the sound speed could stay small over larger temperature range and this might have consequences for e.g. mach cones created by high momentum jets traversing the thermal medium @xcite . on the other hand , while the collisions planned at gsi / fair facility might lead to more optimal @xmath16 trajectories for this argument to work , the probability for the production of the required high momentum probes is much smaller .",
    "however , we remind the reader that a thorough investigation of the heavy ion phenomenology should be carried out with an effective theory suited to describe the @xmath112 case .",
    "in this paper we have analysed thermodynamics of two effective theories for qcd containing as relevant degrees of freedom the polyakov loop and chiral fields within a framework proposed to correctly interpolate between the pure gauge , center symmetric , and chirally symmetric two flavor qcd . at zero chemical potential but finite temperature",
    "we observed that the contribution from the polyakov loop to thermodynamical quantities like the pressure is very important ; roughly half of the total pressure .",
    "another aspect which underlines the importance of the polyakov loop sector is the fact that adding it to the dynamics tends to diminish the qualitative differences present in the bare chiral theories at finite temperature .",
    "we have considered explicitly two realizations , the linear sigma model and the njl model .",
    "our results indiate that even if both lsm and njl models describe the chiral dynamics of the qcd vacuum correctly , they must be supplied by other degrees of freedom in order to obtain quantitatively correct effective description of qcd thermodynamics .",
    "we presented a comparison with respect to a recent result interpolating between resummed perturbation theory result and resonance gas result @xcite , and outlined how future lattice simulations could allow one to obtain more insight into the qcd dynamics near the phase transition .",
    "we also considered finite chemical potentials and determined the ( @xmath113)-phase diagram of these theories .",
    "here we observed large discrepancies between the plsm and pnjl models .",
    "based on the above discussion , an obvious explanation would be that some important dynamics is again being missed . a natural candidate for a new relevant degree of freedom",
    "is the diquark condensate responsible for the color superconducting phenomena .",
    "we aim to extend our work towards this direction next .",
    "we also determined the lines of constant @xmath114 in @xmath12-plane and discussed the implications for the equation of state as well as for the possible focusing behavior relevant for the experimental discovery of the qcd critical point .",
    "these results can be used for phenomenological applications .",
    "the parametrization of the equation of state obtained from these models has been shown to agree with lattice data at @xmath11 but is easily evaluated also at finite values of the chemical potential . hence it could be applied in hydrodynamical simulations of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "we have evaluated the sound speed , and shown that on the hydrodynamically relevant trajectories there may be substantial temperature range over which the sound speed is small .",
    "however , it may prove difficult in the laboratory to create systems which would follow these particular trajectories .",
    "we hope to extend these phenomenological studies within realistic hydrodynamics in near future .",
    "there are several improvements to be addressed .",
    "we have already stressed that below the critical temperature , a more careful treatment of hadronic degrees of freedom is required , and the lack of this treatment is best seen in the apparent underestimate of the pressure below @xmath75 .",
    "another issue clearly concerns the number of active flavors .",
    "here we have concentrated only on the case of two flavors , while for more quantitative phenomenology it is vital to have the effects of the strange quark under control . however , as a first approximation for the equation of state at small chemical potential it should be reasonable to multiply the pressure by the overall factor @xmath115 where @xmath116 counts both the bosonic and fermionc degrees of freedom .",
    "lattice data @xcite indicates that the flavor dependence of the qcd pressure is dominated by the stefan - boltzman factor and the above scaling can be applied within 10 % accuracy .",
    "similar reasoning has been used also in @xcite to obtain the perturbative qcd result for full @xmath82 flavors with masses @xmath117 .",
    "we aim to address these issues in future work within the effective theory framework discussed here .",
