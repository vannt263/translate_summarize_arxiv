    "a large and diverse variety of cosmological observations @xcite , during the last two decades ( notably the nobel prizes in 2006 and in 2011 ) have established that we live in a flat universe with an accelerated expansion .",
    "this is consistent with the einstein s general theory of relativity with a cosmological constant term .",
    "the cosmological constant ( @xmath1 ) , also known as dark energy , is treated as an ideal fluid with negative pressure ; and with equation of state @xmath2 , where @xmath3 .",
    "dark energy density dominates over that of baryonic and dark matter ; and it constitute two third of the universe .",
    "this model of the universe is known as the @xmath1cdm model or standard model of cosmology .",
    "the foundation of the standard model of cosmology ( @xmath1cdm cosmology ) is the cosmological principle ( hereafter cp ) , which states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on the large scales @xcite .",
    "cp along with the fact that two third of the constituents of the universe is dark energy can explain many cosmological observations and is the most successful model till date . despite its success",
    ", @xmath1cdm model has its shortcomings ; few of which are summarized below :    * observations indicate significantly larger amplitude of flows than what @xmath1cdm predicts .",
    "@xcite found the large scale peculiar velocity larger than 400km / sec at scales up to @xmath4 mpc .",
    "this is in the direction @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "the probability of finding such a flow in the @xmath1cdm cosmology is less than @xmath7 . * the planes normal to the quadrupole ( @xmath8 ) and octopole ( @xmath9 ) are aligned with each other and with the direction of the dipole ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "this indicates a preferred axis ; and is inconsistent with the gaussian random , statistically isotropic skies at about @xmath11 . * using hst key project data @xcite showed that a statistically significant variation of at least 9 km / s / mpc exists in the observed value of @xmath12 with a directional uncertainty of about 10 - 20% .",
    "@xcite also found directional dependence in the hst key project data . *",
    "recent work provides some evidence for what is known as the hubble bubble @xcite which suggests that we might be living inside a large void .",
    "value of the hubble constant inside the bubble is different from what is outside the bubble .",
    "there is evidence for such large scale voids in the cmb maps as well @xcite , suggesting that such large voids are not implausible .",
    "if our position is near the center of such a void one can explain the dimming of sne without invoking dark energy . however , this challenges the copernican principle that we do not occupy a special place in the universe .",
    "if we assume that our position is off - centered then one can explain the preferred axis ( or tiny departures from cp ) also ( @xcite ) .    in summary ,",
    "some cosmological observations show departure from cp and hence are in contradiction to the standard model of cosmology .",
    "another threat to the model comes from the fact that observed value of @xmath1 does not match its theoretical value and requires fine tuning . to avoid this several alternative explanations",
    "have been suggested @xcite . in many of these alternative models",
    ", @xmath13 is allowed to be different from @xmath14 in the past ; and approaches @xmath15 at low red - shifts .",
    "it is different from cosmological constant , since there the value of @xmath13 is always @xmath14 .",
    "cosmological observations suggest @xmath15 at the present epoch , which is consistent with @xmath1cdm as well as the alternative cosmologies . to be able to distinguish among various models , we require data that is precise enough to discern tiny variations in the dark energy . it is also required that data be available at a large number of redshifts to constrain the detailed behavior of dark energy with time . at the present the only data that comes reasonably close to these requirements is provided by the observations of the high - redshift supernovae , which are believed to be standard candles .",
    "besides , the quality of the sne ia data maybe doubtful due to the following reasons :    * the physics of sne ia is relatively poorly understood . *",
    "the possibility of physical mechanisms , such as dust in the inter - galactic medium that systematically dims them . * the supernova data are usually collated from several different sources that might have slightly different systematics , due either to instrumental effects or to the fact that they occur in different directions in the sky .",
    "since we have to correct for the galactic dust extinction , which might not get completely removed from the samples , this might produce anisotropy in data .",
    "these considerations imply that to have precise information about the behavior of dark energy we should have a good knowledge of the statistical properties of supernovae , both random as well as systematic .",
    "there have been several attempts to search for the direction dependence in the sne ia data .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter gsl08 ) and @xcite ( hereafter gs10 ) used the extreme value statistics to show that the two supernova data sets , @xcite ( gd04 ) and @xcite ( gd07 ) , do show some evidence for direction dependence .",
    "@xcite have also shown a preferred axis using the union2 catalogue from @xcite .",
    "several other works have also indicated either systematic problems with the high - redshift supernova data or directional dependence in the supernova data and other probes @xcite .    in this paper",
    "our main task is 1 ) to look for direction dependent systematic effects in the latest sne ia data ( union 2 catalogue ) and 2 ) to compare the quality of this data with the previous data sets ( gold data 2004 and 2007 ) .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we introduce the statistic we have used , in   3 we provide our results and end with conclusions in   4 .",
    "we use the gold data ( gd04 and gd07 ) @xcite and the union2 data @xcite for our analysis . the gold data gd04 and gd07 contain 157 and 182 sne respectively ; while the most recent and largest set union2 contains 557 supernovae . for a given supernova",
    "the measured quantity , the distance modulus @xmath16 , is the difference between the apparent and the absolute magnitude @xmath17 where the apparent magnitude @xmath18 depends on the intrinsic luminosity of a supernova , the redshift @xmath19 and the cosmological parameters ; and @xmath20 is the absolute magnitude of a type  ia supernova . it can be expressed in terms of the luminosity distance @xmath21 as @xmath22 where the luminosity distance is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 , and thus depends only on the cosmological parameters matter density @xmath25 and the dark energy density @xmath26 .",
    "we assume that the prescription for the variation of dark energy with redshift is separately specified , for example in the @xmath1cdm model the energy density in the dark energy remains a constant . in eq  [ eq : mu1 ] the dependence of the measured quantity @xmath16 on @xmath20 is linear . since @xmath16 depends on the logarithm of the luminosity distance it is clear that it depends linearly on the logarithm of the hubble parameter @xmath12 .",
    "usually the data is given in terms of eq  [ eq : mu ] , where the constant @xmath20 has already been marginalized over .",
    "thus , instead of two nuisance parameters we are left with only one parameter , the hubble constant @xmath12 .",
    "we now give an introduction of the @xmath27 statistic previously introduced and used in gsl08 and gs10 .",
    "a generalization was given in gs10 , where we had numerically marginalized over the hubble constant @xmath12 .",
    "some of the details are repeated here to make this work self - contained . for our analysis",
    "we have assumed a flat @xmath1cdm universe .",
    "a similar analysis could be carried out for a more general model of dark energy .",
    "we consider subsets of the full data set to construct our statistic consisting of @xmath28 data points .",
    "since the @xmath1cdm model fits the gold data sets gd04 , gd07 and union2 well , we first obtain the best fit to the _ full data sets _ by minimizing the @xmath29 , which we define as : @xmath30}^2 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath31 is observed standard error in @xmath32 . by this",
    "we obtain the best fit values of the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath12",
    ". then for each supernova we calculate , where @xmath34 is calculated using the best fit values of @xmath33 and @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that all the supernovae are statistically uncorrelated .",
    "we define @xmath35 and the normalized quantity @xmath36 , @xmath37 indicates the statistical scatter of the subset from the best fit @xmath1cdm model and its expectation value is unity that is @xmath38 .",
    "if cp holds then the apparent magnitude of a supernova should not depend on the direction in which it is observed but only on the cosmology and thus supernovae in different directions should be scattered similarly with respect to the best fit model .",
    "supernovae , whose positions on the sky were generated randomly.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]     supernovae , whose positions on the sky were generated randomly.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we divide the data into two hemispheres labeled by the direction vector @xmath39 , and take the difference of the @xmath40 computed for the two hemispheres separately to obtain @xmath41 , where label 1 corresponds to that hemisphere towards which the direction vector @xmath39 points and label 2 refers to the other hemisphere .",
    "we take the absolute value of @xmath42 since we are interested in the largest value of this quantity and it is obvious that for every value of @xmath42 , the antipodal point has the negative of that value .",
    "we then vary the direction @xmath39 across the sky to obtain the maximum absolute difference @xmath43 as shown in gsl08 , the distribution of @xmath0 follows a simple , two parameter gumbel distribution , characteristic of extreme value distribution type  i @xcite , @xmath44\\,\\exp\\left [ -\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta_{\\chi^2 } -m}{s}\\right)\\right]\\,\\,,\\ ] ] where the position parameter @xmath45 and the scale parameter @xmath46 completely determine the distribution . to quantify departures from isotropy we need to know the theoretical distribution ,",
    "which is calculated numerically by simulating several sets of gaussian distributed @xmath47 on the gold set supernova positions and obtaining @xmath0 from each realization . and as in gsl08 , we compute a bootstrap distribution by shuffling the data values @xmath48 ,",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath50 over the supernovae positions ( for further details see gsl08 ) .",
    "a modified version of this statistic was introduced in gs10 , which marginalizes over the hubble constant . however , by this we loose all the information about @xmath12 and hence , here we do not marginalize .",
    "statistic . theoretical distribution is shifted to the left compared to what we find for our simulated data in figure  [ fig : sim157 ] , which uses gaussian deviates suggesting evidence for non - gaussianity.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]     statistic .",
    "theoretical distribution is to the right as expected by simulated data in figure  [ fig : sim157 ] , which uses gaussian deviates suggesting evidence for non - gaussianity.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]     statistic .",
    "theoretical distribution is not compatible with figure  [ fig : sim500 ] for the simulated data , which implies slight non - gaussianity for the residuals.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in gsl08 and gs10 we discussed a specific bias in the bootstrap distribution , showing that it is shifted slightly to the left of the theoretical distribution due to the fact that theoretical distribution is obtained by assuming @xmath47s to be gaussian random variates with a zero mean and unit variance .",
    "therefore theoretical @xmath47s are unbounded .",
    "however , the bootstrap distribution is obtained by shuffling through a _ specific realization _ of @xmath47 , and they have a maximum value for some supernova .",
    "it is clear that this should , on the average , produce slightly smaller values of @xmath0 in comparison with what one expects from a gaussian distributed @xmath47 . for reference",
    "we plot the results for simulations in figure  [ fig : sim157 ] with a total of @xmath51 and in figure  [ fig : sim500 ] with a total of @xmath52 supernovae .",
    "our results in this paper should be interpreted with respect to figure  [ fig : sim157 ] for gd04 and gd07 , and figure  [ fig : sim500 ] for union2 data .",
    "concerns regarding the small number of supernovae in the gold data and its effect on the efficacy of our method can bee addressed by the fact that overall behavior of figure  [ fig : sim157 ] is repeated in figure  [ fig : sim500 ] which is plotted for more than @xmath53 of sne .    .",
    "the model parameters ( @xmath1cdm ) for the three data sets are tabulated here . [ cols=\"^,^,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     this statistic is similar to the one presented in gsl08 and gs10 except for the fact that in gs10 we had marginalized over the hubble parameter .",
    "our results are different from those presented in gsl08 also due to the fact that we have corrected the numerical bug mentioned in the gs10 produced by the fact that the theoretical distribution was produced slightly differently from the way bootstrap method thereby creating a greater discrepancy between them then should have been the case . in table",
    "[ tbl - oldfit ] we give the best fit values of @xmath25 and @xmath12 for all the three data sets .",
    "we note that union2 gives slightly lower value of @xmath25 and higher value of @xmath12 compared to the gold data .",
    "reduced @xmath29 is smallest for gd07 which indicates that errors are overestimated for this set .",
    "union2 is best among all the three sets in terms of @xmath29 .",
    "the direction of maximum discrepancy and the value of ( @xmath0 ) is presented in table  [ tbl - olddel ] .",
    "* gd04 * : in fig  [ fig : old04 ] we plot the bootstrap and the theoretical distribution expected for gd04 and mark the position of gd04 . comparison with figure  [ fig : sim157 ] shows a signature of non - gaussianity since the theoretical distribution instead of being to the right of the bootstrap is shifted to the left . position of gd04 is about 2 sigma away from the peak of the bootstrap distribution , indicating direction dependence .    * gd07 * : fig  [ fig : old07 ] for gd07 is same as for gd04 .",
    "a comparison with figure  [ fig : sim157 ] shows that our results are compatible with the absence of non - gaussianity in the data .",
    "gd07 sits at about one sigma away from the peak of the distribution , thus the directional dependence has got weaker than found in gd04 .",
    "* union2 * in fig  [ fig : union2chisq ] we plot both the distributions for union 2 , which is to be compared with fig  [ fig : sim500 ] .",
    "comparison shows a weak signature of non - gaussianity , since position of the bootstrap distribution is not to the left of the theoretical distribution .",
    "position of union2 is about one sigma away from the peak of the bootstrap distribution which is a sign of direction dependence .",
    "we have presented results for the gd04 , gd07 and union2 data using the statistic introduced in gsl08 and gs10 .",
    "our main conclusions for this part of our work are :    1 .   gd04 shows some evidence for non - gaussianity , however , gd07 is entirely consistent with a gaussian distribution of residuals .",
    "union 2 data again shows some evidence for non - gaussianity although weaker compared to gd04 .",
    "thus , in terms of gaussianity , gd07 is best among the three data sets .",
    "gd04 is different from the peak of the bootstrap distribution by slightly more than one sigma ; while gd07 and union2 both are different from the peak by about a sigma .",
    "there seems a weak but consistent direction dependence in all three data sets .",
    "this consistency indicates a physical effect or a preferred direction .",
