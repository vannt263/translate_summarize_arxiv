    "the quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) insulator , also known as the chern insulator , is a two - dimensional ( 2d ) ferromagnetic ( fm ) insulator with a nonzero chern number , resulting in a quantized boundary anomalous hall conductivity without an external magnetic field as first proposed by the haldane model on a hexagonal lattice.@xcite the quantized conductivity is given by @xmath9 with the planck constant @xmath10 and electronic charge @xmath11 , and the chern number @xmath8  quantized due to topological restrictions .",
    "@xmath8 , whose origin involves occupied states entangled with conduction states , corresponds to the number of dissipationless and gapless edge states for the fm 2d chern insulator.@xcite the qah insulator is anticipated to be a good candidate , with a great advantage in practice , for anticipated applications of no energy consumption electronics@xcite , for majorana fermions and their manipulation@xcite , and for future photonic devices.@xcite high chern number materials will provide comparably higher conductivities .",
    "a chern insulating state arises in a broken time reversal system where spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) inverts valence and conduction bands which would otherwise provide a trivial insulating phase .",
    "the topological gap is thereby limited by the strength of soc . the interplay between strong interactions and strength of soc is being explored in the contexts of topologically insulating iridates@xcite and possibly osmates , but primarily model hamiltonian treatments have explored ( or suggested ) the related phase diagram , and none have followed how the phase transition occurs .",
    "witczak - krempa and collaborators@xcite have presented a heuristic phase diagram in which a chern insulating state borders a ( trivial ) mott insulator .",
    "however , modeling of the evolution of a realizable system through such a transition is only now being addressed , with an example being the results of doennig and co - workers@xcite of the interplay between soc and correlation effects in manipulating the competition between chern and mott phases in a buckled ( 111 ) bilayer of lafeo@xmath12 in laalo@xmath12 . here",
    "we provide a related example for the bulk transition metal oxide and ising fm bafe@xmath6(po@xmath7)@xmath6 ( bfpo ) whose structure is shown in fig . 1 , of the competition between soc and strong interaction in creating and then annihilating a high chern number qah phase .",
    "the qah phase has been predicted in various artificial structures that can be roughly classified into three groups : ( 1 ) topological insulators doped by magnetic transition metal ( tm ) ions@xcite , ( 2 ) thin tm layers on a hexagonal lattice@xcite , and ( 3 ) heterostructures of \\{111}-oriented double perovskite or tm oxides@xcite . a qah state of @xmath8=@xmath13 was calculated for cro@xmath6/tio@xmath6@xcite and vo@xmath6/tio@xmath6@xcite heterostructures .",
    "however , having gaps of 2 - 4 mev leaves them primarily of academic interest .",
    "a qah state was also suggested and then calculated for perovskite bilayers@xcite , but required a tuning of hybridization or trigonal distortion to realize a qah phase .",
    "et al . _ suggested @xmath8=@xmath13 qah with a larger ( @xmath14 mev ) gap in graphene decorated with @xmath15 transition - metal ions@xcite , while zhou _",
    "_ proposed the @xmath8=1 state with a larger gap around 100 mev in a hexagonal tungsten lattice on the monolayer cl - covered si(111 ) surface@xcite .",
    "generally , the qah phase in these thin films has been expected only at a particular thickness . beyond the predicted systems , toy models@xcite with topological flat bands have suggested high chern numbers in thin films or artificial heterostructures .",
    "a chern insulating state in bulk solids remains a goal for both research study and possible applications , and large chern numbers are especially valued .",
    "aside from these theoretically designed systems , a qah realization has been reported in the cr - doped topological insulator ( bi , sb)@xmath6te@xmath12 with @xmath8=1 at very low temperature.@xcite to realize a qah insulator with a large nontrivial gap , high curie temperature @xmath16 , and high chern number in real or easily synthesized compounds remains a challenge .",
    "morimoto and nagaosa proposed,@xcite based on a strong forward - scattering amplitude model , that large gap topological insulators may be possible to achieve in strongly interacting systems , which shifts the focus away from @xmath17 materials .    in this paper",
    "we uncover , and then analyze the nature of , a transition between gapped topological ( chern ) and trivial ( mott ) insulating states in bfpo using a correlated band approach including soc , by tuning the interaction strength . with increasing interaction strength , a compensated low - density chern semimetal evolves into a @xmath8=3 chern insulator with a gap up to 80 mev , then transforms abruptly to a trivial mott insulator , versus increasing strength of on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath0 .",
    "it is remarkable that the critical value for the transition is @xmath18 = 2.45 ev , a factor of more than sixty greater than the soc strength @xmath1=40 mev that produced the chern phase .",
    "this interplay between soc and strong interaction highlights how small energy scales can leverage topological restrictions to resist effects of much larger energy scales .",
    "symmetries that are present can be critical for topological materials .",
    "insulating bfpo@xcite crystallizes in space group @xmath19 ( threefold rotation plus inversion ) and is composed of layered 2d honeycomb sublattices of fe@xmath5 ions within feo@xmath20 octahedra , as pictured in fig . [ structure ] . due to a substantial interlayer separation of the fe layers separated by ba@xmath5 and ( po@xmath7)@xmath21 insulating layers ,",
    "bfpo is 2d electronically .",
    "bfpo was synthesized by mentr and coworkers@xcite , who identified the rare 2d ising fm nature with curie temperature @xmath22 k. the very large calculated magnetocrystalline anisotropy is related to the large orbital moment .",
    "our previous study@xcite provided the relaxed atomic positions and revealed large exchange splitting @xmath23=3 ev of the @xmath24 ion , enforcing the high spin @xmath25 configuration with its filled and inactive majority @xmath26 orbitals .",
    "soc will couple the single minority @xmath27 electron to majority orbitals 2 - 3 ev removed in energy .",
    "nevertheless , as we will see , soc plays a critical role in bfpo .",
    "the all - electron full - potential code wien2k@xcite incorporating density - functional - theory - based methods was applied , with the structural parameters optimized in our previous study.@xcite the perdew - burke - ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) was used as the exchange - correlation functional.@xcite the combined effects of correlation ( hubbard u ) and soc , needed to produce the insulating state , were included through gga+u+soc calculations .",
    "based on previous experience,@xcite @xmath0 is varied up to 4 ev , while the hund s exchange parameter @xmath28 is fixed to 0.7 ev .    from these results , a tight - binding hamiltonian for the @xmath27 manifold",
    "was obtained in terms of maximally localized wannier functions@xcite as implemented in wannier90 .",
    "all necessary files for wannier90 were prepared by the code wien2wannier.@xcite the brillouin zone ( bz ) , gapped almost everywhere , was sampled by @xmath29 @xmath30-mesh , and 16 orbitals were used for the wannier function projection . using wannier90 ,",
    "the berry curvature and the anomalous hall conductivity were calculated with a very dense @xmath30-point grid of 5@xmath3110@xmath32 points to picture the berry curvature and @xmath33 integration mesh to evaluate the anomalous hall conductance .",
    "first we address the evolution of the band structure and berry curvature @xmath34 versus increasing strength of @xmath0 , finding unanticipated behavior .",
    "although the perturbation theory expression for @xmath35 is used in the calculation , it is instructive to note the expression in terms of the periodic part of the bloch function @xmath36 with non - negative magnitude @xmath37 and real phase @xmath38 ( band indices suppressed ) , @xmath39 , \\label{berryphase}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the rank-2 antisymmetric unit tensor .",
    "the usual expression from perturbation theory suggests ( as we find ) that regions with small bandgaps are important.@xcite these regions of small gap may also involve larger matrix elements , because mixing by soc is larger when the gap is smaller .",
    "equation ( [ berryphase ] ) makes explicit that a nonvanishing berry curvature requires a k - dependent phase .",
    "more specifically , it provides a different picture than the perturbation theory expression ( which is what is actually evaluated ) .",
    "the complementary interpretation is that the berry curvature obtains large contributions from where the gradients of both @xmath37 and @xmath38 are large .",
    "evidently small gaps and large velocity matrix elements promote such large gradients . in integer quantum hall effect systems the chern number was related to zeros in @xmath41.@xcite    in the uncorrelated limit @xmath42 , a tiny electron pocket in the dirac point valley at @xmath2 , visible in fig .",
    "2(a ) , is compensated with a hole pocket at @xmath3,@xcite preventing the dirac point from pinning @xmath43 .",
    "soc leads to the opening of a gap of 40 mev between the dirac bands at @xmath2 , providing the soc energy scale@xcite @xmath1=40 mev .",
    "the small gap results in sharp peaks appearing in fig .",
    "[ berry](f ) in the curvature @xmath34 near the two @xmath2-points ; the splitting into two sharp peaks is caused by the fermi level overlapping slightly the conduction band , reproduced correctly by the fine k - point integration mesh .      for @xmath0 as small as 1 ev the band overlap disappears , the dirac point pins the fermi energy as in graphene , and a sharp , almost @xmath44-function like",
    ", peak appears in @xmath34 at k , shown in fig .",
    "unlike in graphene , here an orbital degree of freedom is involved .",
    "the dirac point degeneracy reflects the degeneracy in @xmath19 symmetry of the @xmath45 orbitals , the bands being linear combinations of fe orbitals with opposite orbital moment projections . incorporating soc ,",
    "these orbitals become entangled with the unbalanced spin character , and a gap of several tens of mev is opened at @xmath2 without inducing any significant orbital moment , _ i.e. _ @xmath45 occupation is retained .    with further increase in @xmath0 , the peaks in @xmath34",
    "broaden as the band structure evolves , with the gap at k increasing smoothly without significant orbital moment .",
    "for @xmath0 up to a critical value @xmath4 , soc retains its hold on the chern state ( see below ) , in spite of the large value of @xmath0 and of spin - exchange splitting @xmath23 , compared to @xmath1 .",
    "the bands and berry curvature calculated for values of @xmath0 from 2.40 ev to 2.475 ev are shown in fig .",
    "3 . above @xmath0=2",
    "ev the gap between valence and conduction bands at @xmath3 decreases rapidly , closing at the critical value @xmath4=2.45 ev as shown in fig .",
    "4 , lower panel .",
    "this gap closing and reopening marks a disentanglement of bands and loss of topological character , as we verify below . note that the eigenvalue crossing at @xmath3 does not lead to a metallic trivial state , but to a mott insulating state dictated by the coulomb repulsion @xmath0 .",
    "the vanishing of the chern number at the transition suggests that the character of the wannier functions of the two filled bands will have changed discontinuously at the critical point .",
    "the character of the berry curvature changes dramatically , as shown in fig .",
    "we had previously found@xcite that beyond @xmath46 2.5 ev the orbital moment @xmath47 increases rapidly from @xmath480.1@xmath49 to 0.50.6@xmath49 , asymptoting to the remarkably large value ( for a @xmath50 ion ) of 0.7@xmath49 for @xmath51 5 ev .",
    "this evolution reflects a reoccupation of orbitals . in the chern phase the minority @xmath27 electron is in a linear combination with almost equal amounts of orbital component @xmath52 and perhaps some @xmath53 , while beyond @xmath4 the @xmath54",
    "orbital becomes fully occupied .",
    "the spin remains close to its s=2 value .",
    "this jump in orbital moment signals the reoccupation from a linear combination of the two @xmath45 orbitals to dominant occupation of the complex @xmath54 linear combination , a sign that soc retains influence even after the loss of topological character .",
    "the topological - to - trivial transition thus results from a continuous , strong interaction driven band reordering , manipulated by the interplay between @xmath0 and the soc energy @xmath1=40 mev .",
    "the transition occurs at a ratio @xmath55=60 .",
    "a chemical potential resolved chern number @xmath8(e ) is obtained from the anomalous hall conductivity @xmath56 = @xmath8  @xmath57 by integrating the berry curvature @xmath35 over the zone , up to the chemical potential . for values of @xmath0 increasing through @xmath4 , the energy - resolved @xmath58 near @xmath43 is displayed in the top panel of fig .",
    "the bottom panel of this figure shows the evolution of the gap , increasing from zero at @xmath0=0 and achieving 80 mev at @xmath0=2 ev . in the range @xmath0=2.0 - 2.4 ev the minimum gap moves from its position at @xmath2 to @xmath3 . in this range bfpo is a chern insulator with @xmath8=  -3 , signaling a quantum anomalous hall phase with _ three times _ the minimum quantized anomalous hall conductivity .",
    "rapidly with @xmath0 increasing from 2.40 ev , the gap at @xmath3 closes and re - opens due to the interchange in energy of the two bands at @xmath3 . at @xmath59",
    "ev , the contribution of the very sharp positive peak at @xmath3 is canceled by smaller negative contributions elsewhere , and @xmath8@xmath600 ; bfpo has transformed to a trivial insulator . besides the fundamental gap , there are additional nontrivial gaps at higher energies .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ ahc2ev ] shows @xmath56 in the 0.25 ev to 1.5 ev range for @xmath61 ev .",
    "overall , there are three nontrivial gaps , about 80 mev wide at @xmath43 and 100 mev at 0.5 ev , and a smaller gap at 1.3 ev .",
    "notably , the highest band has @xmath8=6 , while the two bands just below provide @xmath8=+9 to the running sum .",
    "strong spin - orbit entanglement extends throughout the @xmath27 bands in the chern phase .",
    "the nontrivial states can be attributed to topological spin - orbit band entanglement , at the k points for the physical , fundamental gap ; at the @xmath3 point for band filling up to 0.5 ev ; again at the k points for band filling to 1.3 ev ( see the left panel of fig .",
    "[ ahc2ev ] ) . above @xmath4 ,",
    "the last two gaps increase a little , whereas the lowest one becomes trivial .",
    "soc produces noncollinear texture of the spin and orbital magnetizations , as studied early on in real space by nordstrm and singh.@xcite here we study the spin and orbital moment texture in k - space , comparing its behavior in the chern insulator phase to that in the mott insulator phase .",
    "the results indicate effects of spin - orbit coupling can be strongly confined to specific regions of the zone , but in a manner very different from the high but narrow peaks of the berry curvature .",
    "the contribution to the orbital moment ( and analogously for the spin moment ) at point @xmath62 from point @xmath63 in the zone is @xmath64 in terms of the two occupied minority band wavefunctions @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "these quantities can be summed over the zone to give the texture in real space , or integrated over the cell to give the texture in the zone .",
    "it is this latter approach that we address here , since topological character is connected directly to the @xmath63-dependence of the bloch functions .    with the hope of uncovering additional aspects of the nature of the topological transition , we present in fig .  [ orb ] the orbital moment @xmath67 and spin @xmath68 textures summed over the two occupied minority bands , which are the orbitally active ones in the @xmath27 manifold . the band decomposed",
    "analogs are presented in the supplementary material.@xcite one can readily see that the texture is highly structured , compared for example to the simple vortex shape found on cu(111 ) and au(111 ) surfaces by kim _ et al._@xcite    in the chern phase @xmath69 ( left panels of fig .",
    "[ orb ] ) both orbital and spin textures are slowly varying near their mean values except for sharply defined elliptical regions around the k and k points , where a significant disruption appears .",
    "most notably , the orbital texture displays chiral character of oppositely oriented circulations , reminiscent of the source - sink character found in the berry connection in honeycomb lattice models .",
    "the spin is large everywhere , consistent with the ferromagnetic character , with texture that also displays well defined , but different size and shape , regions around the k and k points .",
    "the @xmath70-components differ in the two regions , both being substantially different from the mean .    beyond the critical value @xmath18",
    ", the mott insulating state appears with enhanced @xmath54 character throughout the zone .",
    "there is a small orbital moment @xmath480.1@xmath49 for @xmath71 but it increases rapidly at larger @xmath0 .",
    "the corresponding textures are shown in the right panels of fig .",
    "the transition from chern to mott insulator at @xmath4 is accompanied by a change in character of both orbital and spin texture fields .",
    "now the effect of soc in coupling spin texture to orbital texture dies rather abruptly away from the k , k points , and structure has appeared around @xmath3 .",
    "it should be mentioned that , unlike the chern number , the change between the textures at @xmath0=2 ev and @xmath0=3 ev is , from its definition , not abrupt .",
    "the value of the ( say ) orbital field @xmath67 at one point @xmath63 does not know what is occurring at other k points , nor does it know specifically about global topological properties ; it varies continuously with changes , including changes in @xmath0 , as long as no first - order transition is encountered .",
    "some general observations can be made .",
    "a strictly local isotropic atomic moment should correspond to a smooth , symmetric texture in k - space .",
    "this is not observed , so the fe moment has substantial itinerant character .",
    "a uniform ( purely itinerant ) magnetization in real space would arise from a strong peak at small @xmath72 .",
    "this also is not observed , so the fe moment does have substantial local character .",
    "it might also be relevant that the fe moment is calculated to have extremely large magnetocrystalline anisotropy .",
    "the sharp boundaries of regions differing from featureless texture are much more prominent in the chern phase than in the trivial phase , indicating that real space texture evolves in both the orbital and spin moments as the orbital moment becomes larger and better defined .",
    "in this work we have followed the evolution of the honeycomb lattice ising ferromagnet bafe@xmath6(po@xmath7)@xmath6 from chern insulator at small to moderate interaction strength u to the mott insulator phase beyond the critical strength @xmath4=2.45 ev , the latter being the physical regime .",
    "a noteworthy aspect is that the chern phase has @xmath8= 3 and , at its maximum , a sizable gap of 80 mev . for small @xmath0",
    "after soc is included , the chern insulator phase is obtained within which the gap at k increases very slowly with @xmath0 . the small soc strength @xmath1=40 mev is sufficient to withstand increasing @xmath0 and support the topological phase up to the critical value @xmath4=2.45 ev .",
    "this support is possible because the increasing ( with @xmath0 ) gap at @xmath2 is supplanted by a decreasing gap at @xmath3 .",
    "however , the gap at @xmath3 closes rapidly , and immediately re - opens with the system in a trivial mott insulating phase ( @xmath8= 0 ) .",
    "for fe in an oxide insulator , @xmath0 will be at least 45 ev in magnitude , so we do not expect bafe@xmath6(po@xmath7)@xmath6 to show chern insulating properties . evidently a larger strength of soc or smaller @xmath0 is the direction to search for a chern insulator in this class .    for additional insight",
    ", we have demonstrated that the spin and angular momentum textures throughout the zone experience an evolution from a tight structure around the k and k points in the chern phase to a more extended character in the mott phase , varying more smoothly throughout the zone .",
    "a distinctive feature of bfpo is the large chern number @xmath8= 3 .",
    "in fact , the highest lying minority @xmath27 band has @xmath8= 6 , with the intermediate bands contributing @xmath8= + 9 .",
    "ren _ et al._@xcite in their review have commented on large chern number systems , and referenced the few that have been predicted , mostly in model systems . as an example , jiang _",
    "et al._@xcite have calculated chern numbers for multilayer films in magnetic fields for which the chern number , for tuned field values , can be as large as the number of layers ( up to 12 in their model ) .",
