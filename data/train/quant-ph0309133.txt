    "this is a reasonably inference , but it is also misleading .",
    "the nonzero values for @xmath292 in figs .",
    "[ g2tau - x1 ] and [ g2tau - x2 ] are in fact due to the presence of more than one photon in the cavity .",
    "although the mean intracavity photon number is only @xmath293 , this number is comparable to the saturation photon number @xmath294 .",
    "indeed , the quantum statistical character of the intracavity field is determined from the self - consistent interplay of atom and cavity field as in standard laser theories , even though it might appear as this interplay is not relevant to the determination of a dynamic steady state .",
    "figure [ variousvsf ] attempts to illustrate this point by investigating the passage from the domain of conventional laser theory through the regime of strong coupling and thence into a domain of single photon generation with @xmath295 over the entire range of pumping conditions .              in section iiia we briefly described our analysis of an equivalent raman scheme to address the question of possible coherence effects associated with the @xmath20 recycling beam .",
    "beyond this analysis , we have also considered the possibility that various other coherent processes associated with the pump fields might be important .",
    "one concern relates to the possibility that @xmath34-wave mixing processes could be important , as for example , in a wave - mixing process that cycles the atom @xmath296 @xcite . from an operational perspective , if there were to be a correlated process involved in the cycling of the atom @xmath297 , then two photons would be emitted into the cavity mode ( the signal  on the @xmath96 transition and the idler  on the @xmath35 transition ) . in this case",
    "since we employ no filter to block the idler  field separated by @xmath298ghz , the measured intensity correlation function @xmath4 for the emitted light from the cavity would exhibit bunching around @xmath299 , instead of the observed antibunching and sub - poissonian character .",
    "the measured character of @xmath4 therefore argues against a coherent process that cycles the atom from an initial quantum state and back to that state by way of coherent processes involving coupling to the cavity field .",
    "we also note that the coherent coupling of the cavity field and atom for the @xmath35 transition is greatly suppressed due to the large detuning @xmath300ghz , leading to an effective coupling coefficient @xmath301 khz@xmath302 mhz@xmath303 .",
    "therefore , for whatever mixing processes , the coupling to the external vacuum modes characterized by the rate @xmath304 should dominate that due to @xmath305 . in this regard , note that we have included the effect of off - resonant coupling of the @xmath95 excited state in our simulations ( which is only @xmath306 mhz detuned ) .",
    "the relevant process is then excitation @xmath307 via the @xmath20 pump field , followed by emission into the cavity mode due to the coherent coupling of the transition @xmath308 .",
    "this coupling increases the intracavity photon number by only about @xmath309 , suggesting that coupling for the @xmath35 transition @xmath298 ghz away is negligible .",
    "in support of these comments , our detailed numerical simulations agree sensibly well with the observed behavior of @xmath4 ( as in figures [ g2tau - x1 ] and [ g2tau - x2 ] ) , and do not include any wave - mixingeffects .",
    "this statement is likewise valid for the dependence of photon number versus pump level @xmath310 .",
    "furthermore , as previously discussed , the model calculation for a four - state system agrees well in its essential characteristics with a three - state system where the decay of the ground state @xmath93 is via an ad hoc spontaneous process ( as in a raman laser ) rather than by pumping @xmath311 and decay @xmath35 .",
    "a final general comment relates to the nature of phase - matching ( e.g. , as applied to @xmath34-wave mixing and parametric down conversion ) for a single atom in a cavity . for a sample of atoms ( or a crystal ) , there is a geometry that defines directions for which fields from successive atoms might add constructively for various waves ( e.g. , pump , signal , idler ) .",
    "cavities can then be placed around these directions to enhance the processes ( e.g. , the threshold for an optical parametric oscillator is reduced by a factor of the square of the cavity finesse for resonant enhancement of both signal and idler fields ) .",
    "clearly a cavity would be ineffective if its geometry did not match the preferred geometry defined by the sample and pump beams .",
    "however , for a single atom as in our experiment , these considerations do not apply in nearly the same fashion .",
    "the relevant issues are the coherent coupling coefficients @xmath312 of the various atomic transitions to the cavity field .",
    "we have presented a simplified four - level model which describes the qualitative features of our experiment .",
    "we have shown how decreasing the cavity length causes the model system to move from a regime of weak coupling , where the semiclassical laser theory applies , into a regime of strong coupling , where quantum deviations become important .",
    "the four - state model predicts many of the observed features of our experimental system , including the qualitative shape of the intracavity photon number versus pumping intensity curve , and photon antibunching .",
    "in addition , to predict quantitative values for comparison with our experimental results , we have developed a full multi - level model which correctly describes optical pumping and larmor precession effects within the zeeman substructure .",
    "we have shown that these effects play an important role in describing the observed input/ output characteristics of the system , and that by including a simple model for the motion of the atom we can obtain reasonable agreement with the experimentally observed curve .",
