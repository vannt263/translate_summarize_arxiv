    "<S> we examine the physical basis for algorithms to replace mixing - length theory ( mlt ) in stellar evolutionary computations . </S>",
    "<S> our 321d procedure is based on numerical solutions of the navier - stokes equations . </S>",
    "<S> these implicit large eddy simulations ( iles ) are three - dimensional ( 3d ) , time - dependent , and turbulent , including the kolmogorov cascade . </S>",
    "<S> we use the reynolds - averaged navier - stokes ( rans ) formulation to make concise the 3d simulation data , and use the 3d simulations to give closure for the rans equations . </S>",
    "<S> we further analyze this data set with a simple analytical model , which is non - local and time - dependent , and which contains both mlt and the lorenz convective roll as particular subsets of solutions . a characteristic length ( the damping length ) </S>",

    "<S> the nature of mixing and convective boundaries is analyzed , including dynamic , thermal and compositional effects , and compared to a simple model . </S>",
    "<S> we find that ( 1 ) braking regions ( boundary layers in which mixing occurs ) automatically appear _ beyond _ the edges of convection as defined by the schwarzschild criterion , ( 2 ) dynamic ( non - local ) terms imply a non - zero turbulent kinetic energy flux ( unlike mlt ) , ( 3 ) the effects of composition gradients on flow can be comparable to thermal effects , and ( 4 ) convective boundaries in neutrino - cooled stages differ in nature from those in photon - cooled stages ( different pclet numbers ) . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithms are based upon iles solutions to the navier - stokes equations , so that , unlike mlt , they do not require any calibration to astronomical systems in order to predict stellar properties . </S>",
    "<S> implications for solar abundances , helioseismology , asteroseismology , nucleosynthesis yields , supernova progenitors and core collapse are indicated . </S>"
