    "the discovery of the misalignment between the orbital axes of hot jupiters ( hjs ; giant planets with orbital periods of @xmath1  days ) and the spin axes of their host stars ( e.g. hebrard et al .",

    "; winn & fabrycky 2015 ) continues to pose a significant puzzle . while primordial disk misalignment ( with respect to the stellar spin ) is a possible explanation ( e.g. bate et al .",
    "2010 ; lai et al .  2011 ; foucart & lai 2011 ; batygin 2012 ; batygin & adams 2013 ; lai 2014 ; spalding & batygin 2014 ) , it is likely that a significant fraction of hjs and the associated spin - orbit misalignments are produced by dynamical means involving multi - planet interactions or planet - binary interactions .",
    "lidov - kozai ( lk ) oscillations ( lidov 1962 , kozai 1962 ) induced by external stellar or planetary companions",
    " one of the proposed channels of hot jupiter formation ( e.g. wu & murray 2003 ; fabrycky & tremaine 2007 ; correia et al 2011 ; beaug & nesvorn 2012 ; naoz et al .",
    "2012 ; petrovich 2015 ; anderson , storch & lai 2016 ; muoz , lai & liu 2016 ; petrovich & tremaine 2016 )  provide a natural means of generating spin - orbit misalignment .",
    "lidov - kozai oscillations occur when the proto - hj s host star has a binary ( or external planetary ) companion .",
    "a proto - hj is assumed to form at several aus from its host .",
    "if its orbital axis is sufficiently misaligned relative to the outer binary axis , its orbit undergoes large correlated variations in eccentricity and inclination .",
    "if the misalignment is substantial , very high eccentricities ( in excess of @xmath2 ) can be attained ; during these high - eccentricity phases , tidal dissipation at periastron brings the planet close to its host , eventually creating a hj .    since the host star of a giant planet generally has an appreciable rotation ( with rotation period ranging from a few days to 30  days ) and is oblate , significant coupling can exist between the orbital dynamics of the proto - hj and the dynamics of the stellar spin axis .",
    "this coupling is vital in determining the final spin - orbit misalignments of these systems .",
    "indeed , in storch , anderson & lai ( 2014 ; hereafter sal14 ) we showed that the evolution of the stellar spin axis , driven by the quasi - periodic changes in the planet orbit , can be very complex and even chaotic , and this evolution depends sensitively on the planet mass and stellar rotation period . subsequently , in storch & lai ( 2015 ; hereafter sl15 ) , we studied the origin of the chaotic behavior ( in terms of secular spin - orbit resonances and their overlaps ) by analysing the non - dissipative ( i.e. no tidal dissipation ) `` stellar spin + planet + binary '' system and considering the regime in which the stellar spin precession rate was much higher than the lk oscillation frequency ( the `` adiabatic '' regime ) . in anderson ,",
    "storch & lai ( 2016 ; hereafter asl16 ) , we conducted a comprehensive population synthesis study of hj formation via lk migration in stellar binaries , including all relevant physical effects ( the octupole potential from the binary companion , various short - range forces , tidal dissipation , and stellar spin - down due to magnetic braking ) .",
    "in particular , our extensive monte - carlo experiments ( see section 4 of asl16 ) revealed various paths of spin - orbit evolution during lk migration .    in the present work ,",
    "we develop an analytic theory to understand the evolution of spin - orbit misalignment during lk migration in stellar binaries .",
    "we extend the analysis of sl15 to the non - adiabatic regime ( i.e. the regime in which the star precesses slowly ) .",
    "we account for various non - ideal effects ( such as periastron advance due to general relativity and planet oblateness ) and include tidal dissipation in our `` stellar spin + planet + binary '' system .",
    "our goal is to provide theoretical explanations for the various paths to spin - orbit misalignment that lk oscillations can induce and to shed light on how the final spin - orbit misalignments of hjs are achieved during lk migration .",
    "although our focus is on stellar binary - induced lk migration , most of our results can be adapted to the planet - induced lk migration scenario .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly review our previous work and introduce the most important concepts and equations in lk - driven spin - orbit dynamics . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the effect that short - range forces have on the spin - orbit dynamics . in section 4",
    ", we examine the different regimes of non - dissipative spin dynamics . in sections 5 and 6 ,",
    "we include tidal dissipation and study the various paths toward misalignment during lk migration .",
    "we identify the key paremeters that determine different behaviors of the misalignment evolution .",
    "we discuss the limitations and uncertainties of our work in section 7 and summarize our key findings in section 8 .",
    "readers who are less interested in the technical details can go to section 5.1 for a description of the five different spin - orbit evolution paths ( with more detailed explanations in sections 5.2 - 5.6 ) , and section 8 for a brief summary .",
    "we consider a star of mass @xmath3 hosting a planet of mass @xmath4 ( such that @xmath5 ) , and a stellar binary companion with mass @xmath6 .",
    "note that , in all calculations presented in this paper , we set @xmath7 .    throughout this work we consider lk oscillations to quadrupole order only .",
    "this is an important simplification / approximation in order to facilitate our theoretical analysis .",
    "note , however , that our extensive monte - carlo calculations ( asl16 ) have showed that the dominant effect of the octupole potential of the binary companion is to increase the tidal disruption efficiency of planets , and that a majority of hjs are formed through the `` normal '' ( quadrupole ) channel ( see also muoz et al .  2016 ; petrovich 2015 ) .",
    "thus , we assume that the host star and binary companion are in a fixed circular orbit ( which naturally leads to zero octupole potential ) with semi - major axis @xmath8 , and the binary orbital axis @xmath9 defines the invariant plane of the system .",
    "the planet orbit is described by its semi - major axis @xmath10 , eccentricity @xmath0 , and angular momentum vector @xmath11 , which is inclined relative to @xmath9 .",
    "we define @xmath12 . in the lk mechanism ,",
    "if the initial @xmath13 satisfies @xmath14 , the planet orbit undergoes oscillations in @xmath0 and @xmath15 , as well as nodal and periastron precessions , while conserving @xmath16 .",
    "the oscillations happen on a characteristic timescale @xmath17 given by t_k^-1=n ( ) ( ) ^3 , where @xmath18 is the mean motion frequency of the planet . in the absence of short - range forces ( see section 3 ) , the maximum eccentricity achieved during an lk cycle is given by e_max=(1 - 53 ^ 2_lb^0)^1/2 .",
    "[ emax ] short - range forces tend to reduce @xmath19 from this value , but do not change the characteristics of the lk oscillations .",
    "an important quantity for our later analysis is the frequency of eccentricity oscillations , which is given by n_e = t^-1_k , where @xmath20 is of order unity and depends on strengths of short - range forces and the value of the initial eccentricity @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is the lk eccentricity oscillation period ) .",
    "we also define the quantities _ pl _ pl,0f(e ) , _ lb as the nodal precession rate of @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 the nodal precession rate at @xmath25 ) , and the nutation rate of @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "each of these quantities is a strong function of eccentricity , and therefore time ; together , they serve as the `` driving forces '' for the stellar spin dynamics .      due to the star s rotation - induced quadrupole , the stellar spin axis @xmath26 experiences periodic torquing from the planet , which is strongest at the maximum eccentricity points of the lk cycle",
    "this torque induces precession of @xmath26 around the planet s orbital angular momentum axis @xmath23 , governed by the equation = ps .",

    "- [ omps ] is the precession frequency . here",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 are the principal moments of inertia of the star , @xmath29 is the magnitude of the spin angular momentum , and @xmath30 is the angle between @xmath26 and @xmath23 . to separate out the @xmath30 and @xmath0 dependencies , we define a function @xmath31 via ps .",

    "[ alpha0 ] here we have used @xmath32 , with @xmath33 the dimensionless stellar rotation rate , and @xmath34 . for a solar - type star , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 ( claret & gimenez 1992 ) .",
    "note that since @xmath31 is just @xmath37 evaluated at @xmath38 , it gives the maximum attainable spin precession rate during the lk cycle , and @xmath39 gives the maximum precession rate at @xmath25 .",
    "we emphasize that these rates depends linearly on both the planet mass @xmath4 and the stellar spin rate @xmath40 , and are strong inverse functions of the semi - major axis @xmath10 .",
    "sal14 and sl15 further defined the `` adiabaticity parameter '' @xmath41 as , and showed that , generically speaking , @xmath41 serves as a predictor for the dynamical behavior of the system .",
    "given a set of initial parameters such that @xmath42 , the system behaves `` non - adiabatically '' : the nodal precession of @xmath23 ( around @xmath9 ) is much faster than the precession of @xmath26 ( around @xmath23 ) ; therefore , @xmath26 essentially precesses around the time average of @xmath23 , thereby conserving @xmath43 , the angle between the stellar spin axis and the outer binary axis .",
    "if @xmath44 , the system behaves `` adiabatically '' : the nodal precession of @xmath23 is much slower than the precession of @xmath26 , and therefore @xmath26 has no trouble keeping up with @xmath23 and @xmath30 is conserved . for intermediate values of @xmath41 , which sal14 termed the `` trans - adiabatic '' regime ,",
    "the spin dynamics is complex and often chaotic .",
    "sl15 focused on exploring the spin dynamics in this regime but close to the adiabatic transition ( i.e. for @xmath45 ) .",
    "we summarize their methods and findings in the rest of this section .      because our primary goal is to study the behavior of the spin - orbit misalignment angle @xmath30",
    ", it is convenient to work in a frame of reference where @xmath23 is invariant . in this frame",
    ", it can be shown ( sl15 ) that the spin dynamics are governed by the following hamiltonian : & & h(p,_sl,)=\\ { -p^2 + ( ) p + & &  - } , [ kozaiham ] where @xmath46 ( the precession phase of @xmath26 about @xmath23 ) and @xmath47 constitute the conjugate pair of variables ( with @xmath48 acting as the conjugate momentum ) .",
    "the rescaled time @xmath49 is defined as ( t ) = _ 0^t ( t ) dt , where _ 0 ^ 2/n_e(t)dt [ alphabar ] is the ratio of the time - averaged maximum spin precession frequency , @xmath50 , and the lk eccentricity oscillation frequency @xmath51 and thus gives the maximum number of times that @xmath26 can go around @xmath23 in one lk cycle ( see section 3 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath52 is , in fact , a better measure of the adiabaticity of the system than @xmath41 ; we discuss this in more detail later in the section .",
    "note that @xmath49 is normalized such that it varies from @xmath53 to @xmath54 in one lk eccentricity cycle .",
    "the dimensionless functions @xmath55 are given by & & ( ) = -_lb ( ) , [ beta ] + & & ( ) = , [ gamma ] + & & ( ) = -_lb ( ) [ psi ] . since @xmath56 , the functions @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 depend only on the `` shape '' of the orbit , i.e. , on @xmath60 ( with @xmath49 varying from 0 to @xmath54 ) .",

    "( [ gamma2 ] ) . for convenience , we set @xmath61 = @xmath62 , but note that in actuality the time average of the function @xmath58 is @xmath53 , due to its antisymmetric shape .    a resonance occurs when the argument of one of the cosine functions in the above hamiltonian is slow - varying , i.e. if = n , [ eq : reson]with @xmath63 an integer ( positive or negative ) .",
    "all the discussion up to this point applies for arbitrary @xmath41 . we can appreciate the significance of ( [ eq : reson ] ) by considering the small @xmath41 limit . in this case ,",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hexp ] ) is dominated by the first term and we have @xmath64 . then the resonance condition becomes _ ps = -|_sln n_e ,  n = 0,1,2,3,[rescond ] that is , when the time - averaged stellar spin precession frequency equals an integer multiple of the lk eccentricity oscillation frequency @xmath51 , the system experiences a resonance .",

    "we define n_max = , [ nmax ] and allow it to be non - integer because , as discussed previously , it also has physical significance as the maximum number of spin precession cycles ( @xmath26 around @xmath23 ) in one lk cycle .",
    "in later sections we show that , when tidal dissipation is introduced , @xmath68 is one of the two key parameters in determining the dynamical evolution of the system .    as discussed in detail in sl15 , in the @xmath69 vs @xmath70 phase space , the region of influence of each resonance",
    "is defined by its separatrix , which has a distinctive cat - eye shape centered on @xmath71 and @xmath72 or @xmath73 , depending on the sign of @xmath74 ( see fig .",
    "[ shortrangeforces ] ) .",
    "the chirikov criterion ( chirikov 1979 ) states that overlaps in the separatrices of two or more resonances lead to chaos .",
    "we thoroughly explored this idea in sl15 and showed that , indeed , the appearance of chaos in the system can be explained by overlaps between resonances of different @xmath63 s .",
    "one final point needs to be made .",
    "recall that the above discussion of resonances applies in the regime where the first term of the hamiltonian ( [ hexp ] ) dominates over the others .",
    "this regime corresonds roughly to @xmath45 .",
    "more precisely , since in general ( see sl15 ) we have @xmath75 for @xmath76 , the boundary of this regime can be defined more accurately as @xmath77 .",
    "we thus define |(2 _ 0)^-1 [ abar ] as a new , more precise , adiabaticity parameter , such that when @xmath78 the system is adiabatic .",
    "note that @xmath79 can be expressed as |= , [ abar2 ] where the triangle brackets denote time averaging and we have defined @xmath80 .",
    "physically , @xmath81 represents the ratio of the maximum average rate of spin precession to the average rate of change in @xmath23 during the lk cycle .",
    "thus , if @xmath82 , the spin vector hardly moves compared with the orbital angular momentum vector and the system behaves non - adiabatically , whereas when @xmath83 the spin axis evolves adiabatically , closely following the changing @xmath23 ( as long as @xmath69 is not very close to @xmath53 ) . note that , because @xmath84 , for the high inclinations that we consider in this work it is in general true that @xmath85 .",
    "the quantity @xmath86 is invariant so long as the `` shape '' of the orbit remains the same , i.e. it depends only on @xmath60 .",
    "thus , so long as the `` shape '' of the orbit is unchanged , only one parameter ( either @xmath79 or @xmath87 ) determines the evolutionary behavior of the system . in comparing the behavior of systems with orbits of different `` shapes '' , however , both parameters are necessary .    to recapitulate , @xmath79 measures the ( lk - averaged ) maximum spin precession rate , @xmath50 , relative to the rate of change of @xmath23 , whereas @xmath68 measures @xmath50 relative to the lk eccentricity oscillation frequency @xmath51 and sets the maximum resonance order . both @xmath68 and @xmath79 scale linearly with the stellar spin rate and the planet mass ( see eq . [ alpha0 ] ) . in the remainder of the paper",
    ", we will show how the values of these two parameters determine the behavior of the system and , in the presence of tidal dissipation , the ultimate fate of the spin - orbit misalignment angle .",
    "the analysis of sl15 focused solely on the `` pure '' lidov - kozai system with no short - range forces . as a step toward realism",
    ", we now account for extra periastron advances induced in the system by various short - range forces , including gr and the tide- and rotation - induced quadrupole moments of the planet ( e.g. wu & murray 2003 , fabrycky & tremaine 2006 , liu et al .",
    "these extra periastron advance terms affect the lk+spin dynamics in two ways .",
    "first , they slightly change the lk eccentricity oscillation timescale @xmath51 ; this change is small and has no effect on the system dynamics .",
    "second , they reduce ( sometimes significantly ) the maximum eccentricity attained during each lk cycle , thus changing the `` shape '' of @xmath88 . in general , the new maximum eccentricity depends not only on @xmath89 ( cf .",
    ". [ emax ] ) , but also on the physical parameters of the system , including the planet mass and radius ( @xmath4 & @xmath90 ) , the effective binary separation @xmath91 ( but recall that for the purposes of this paper we set @xmath92 ) , and the planet semi - major axis @xmath10 ( see liu et al .",
    "this leads to significant changes in the shape functions defined in eqs .",
    "( [ beta])-([psi ] ) and hence in the fourier coefficients @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 . figure [ srvsnosr ] demonstrates this effect : in general , the variation in the shape functions becomes smoother and less pronounced .",
    "we note that from fig .",
    "[ srvsnosr ] it is obvious that short - range forces increase @xmath62 ( the @xmath49-average of eq . [ beta ] ) and therefore decrease @xmath79 ( eq .",
    "[ abar ] ) , making the system less adiabatic .    due to the reduction of @xmath96 ,",
    "the maximum of @xmath31 ( eq . [ alpha ] ) is also reduced , leading to a significant decrease in @xmath50 ( eq . [ alphabar ] ) .",
    "thus , another consequence of the inclusion of short - range forces is a decrease in the parameter @xmath68 ( eq . [ nmax ] ) .",
    "figure [ nmaxvsi ] ( left ) presents @xmath68 as a function of the initial orbital inclination @xmath89 with and without short - range forces .",
    "we see that , in general , @xmath68 is greatly reduced when short - range forces are included . furthermore , because at high initial inclinations ( e.g , @xmath97 ) , the maximum eccentricity is determined by the short - range forces and is not sensitive to @xmath89 ( e.g. liu _ et al .",
    "_ 2015 ) , @xmath68 becomes nearly independent of the initial inclination .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath68 still scales linearly with the stellar spin rate ( or inversely with the spin period ) , but its dependence on @xmath4 is no longer as simple , since @xmath4 now plays a role in setting the maximum eccentricity .    likewise , the parameter @xmath79 is also affected ( fig .",
    "[ nmaxvsi ] , right ) . like @xmath68",
    ", it still scales linearly with the stellar spin rate .",
    "however , unsurprisingly ( cf . eq . [ abar2 ] ) , it has a much stronger dependence on the initial inclination .    for comparison , figure [ shortrangeforces ]",
    "demonstrates how a sample phase space previously presented in sl15 ( fig .",
    "6 ) changes when short - range forces are added to the system : as expected , the number of resonances is significantly reduced , and on the whole most resonances become wider . in summary , given a system with a set of initial parameters , the inclusion of short - range forces changes the shape functions that drive the spin precession dynamics , and generally decreases both @xmath79 and @xmath68 , reducing the degree of adiabaticity of the system .",
    "finally , note that there is one more `` non - ideal '' effect we have neglected : the perturbation of the planet s orbit due to the rotation - induced stellar quadrupole .",
    "this perturbation comes in two forms .",
    "first , the stellar quadrupole induces additional periastron advance in the orbit , similar to the other short - range forces .",
    "second , the planet s orbit experiences an extra nodal precession , governed by the equation ( ) _ sl = ps .",
    "sl , where the ratio of the stellar spin angular momentum to the orbital angular momentum is & & sl0.12 ( ) ( ) ^1/2 ( ) ^2()^-1 + & & ^-1/2 ( ) ^-1 .",
    "[ eq : soverl]we ignore these effects because , by creating feedback between stellar spin precession and orbit precession , they break the integrability of the hamiltonian system by introducing more degrees of freedom [ i.e. @xmath88 , @xmath98 , etc .",
    "would no longer be solely determined by lk dynamics and in general would not be `` known '' periodic forcing functions acting on the spin evolution ] . neglecting these feedback effects",
    "is the single biggest simplifying assumption we make in our analysis .",
    "the significance of these effects increases with increasing @xmath99 ( see section 4.3 of asl16 for further discussion ) . for low planet masses and high stellar rotation rates ,",
    "this makes our subsequent analysis of the spin dynamics somewhat pedagogical . for higher planet masses and lower stellar spin rates ,",
    "however , the feedback is not as important , and our conclusions should be fairly robust .",
    "in this section we examine the differences in the spin dynamical behavior of a non - dissipative system in the non - adiabatic vs adiabatic regimes .",
    "we select two representative `` shapes '' of the lk orbit by considering systems with @xmath100 , @xmath101 au , @xmath102 au , and either @xmath103 or @xmath104 .",
    "we then vary the stellar spin period , which scales up / down both @xmath68 and @xmath79 .",
    "note that , in order to explore the entire range of possible behaviors , we consider a somewhat unphysical range of stellar spin periods , from as large as @xmath105 days to as small as @xmath66 day .",
    "we first consider the spin dynamics in the non - adiabatic regime , with @xmath106 ( section 4.1 ) .",
    "we then consider the adiabatic regime with @xmath78 ( section 4.2 ) , which is further divided into two sub - regimes with @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( recall that @xmath85 ) .",
    "finally , we specialize to the dynamics of spin trajectories that start with @xmath38 ( i.e. zero initial spin - orbit misalignment ) and discuss their behavior in each of the aforementioned regimes ( section 4.3 ) .",
    "the form of the hamiltonian ( [ hexp ] ) is such that the non - adiabatic regime of spin dynamics does not easily lend itself to pertubation theory and can not be formally explored .",
    "nevertheless , the non - adiabatic regime is very important ( especially for jupiter - mass or smaller planets ) .",
    "we therefore endeavor to study it based on physical arguments we consider reasonable but not necessarily rigorous .",
    "we classify the non - adiabatic regime as having @xmath106 .",
    "since typically @xmath109 , this implies @xmath110 .",
    "thus in the non - adiabatic regime , the stellar spin vector @xmath26 changes slowly compared to both the rate of change of @xmath23 and the lk oscillation frequency .",
    "we therefore surmise that most of the relevant spin dynamics can be captured using a time - independent hamiltonian whose coefficients are the time averages of the externally imposed shape functions ( @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 ) . in other words ,",
    "most of the spin dynamics can be understood by analyzing the @xmath114 hamiltonian ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ oneharmonic ] )",
    "h_0 = n _ , [ noham ] where we have replaced @xmath52 with @xmath68 , replaced @xmath115 using the definition of @xmath79 , and have defined @xmath116 .",
    "first , it is useful to examine the fixed points of the hamiltonian @xmath117 , and how they depend on the stellar spin period . by considering the equations of motion ,",
    "it is easy to see that this hamiltonian has two sets of fixed points : those with @xmath118 and those with @xmath119 . figure [ fixedpoints ] shows how the locations of these fixed points in @xmath69 change with stellar spin period . at very high spin periods ,",
    "only two fixed points exist , one at @xmath118 and another at @xmath119 .",
    "these fixed points are closely related to the well - known cassini states ( e.g. fabrycky et al .  2007 ) .",
    "at @xmath120 days , another set of fixed points appear for @xmath118",
    ". we can now examine how each of these fixed points affects the system dynamics .",
    "the top panels of figure [ samplephasespaces ] present example phase spaces calculated based on the hamiltonian ( [ noham ] ) , for which @xmath106 .",
    "the curves shown in each panel are separatrices that can not be crossed by any spin evolution trajectory .",
    "the shapes of the separatrices constrain the possible trajectories .",
    "thus , an analysis of the separatrix shapes sheds light on the possible behaviors of the system .    at very low values of @xmath79 ( fig .",
    "[ samplephasespaces ] , panel * a * ) , the phase space is roughly split into two islands of libration , each containing a fixed point .",
    "the separatrix of the center island touches @xmath38 , whereas the other touches @xmath121 .",
    "a trajectory starting inside one of these separatrices will librate about the corresponding fixed point in the center of the island .",
    "trajectories starting in the narrow region in - between the two separatrices are able to circulate .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fixedpoints ] , at @xmath120 days , two more fixed points appear .",
    "panel * b * of fig .  [ samplephasespaces ] shows the phase space structure shortly after the appearance of these fixed points .",

    "the top island has one of the new fixed points at its center .",
    "the second new fixed point defines the separatrix between these two islands .",
    "as @xmath79 gets closer to @xmath66 ( fig .",

    "this marks the transition from non - adiabatic to adiabatic behavior .        shortly after the non - adiabatic to adiabatic transition , @xmath68 is still small , and therefore the spin dynamics are still essentially governed by the @xmath114 hamiltonian .",

    "as @xmath79 and @xmath68 continue to increase , this side island rapidly shrinks and is soon overtaken in importance by the newly forming @xmath125 resonance .",

    "giant planets are formed at a few au s distance from their host stars , with the orbital axis aligned with the stellar spin axis .",
    "although in recent years several methods of generating primordial misalignment have been suggested ( e.g. bate et al .",
    "2010 ; batygin 2012 ; batygin & adams 2013 ; lai 2014 ; lai et al .",

    "what determines the dynamic behavior of the stellar spin as the planet undergoes lk oscillations ?",
    "one key observation can be taken away from the six panels presented in fig .",
    "[ samplephasespaces ] : regardless of what regime the system is in , there is _ always _ a separatrix `` attached '' to @xmath38 . in the non - adiabatic regime ( @xmath106 )",
    "this separatrix is the @xmath114 center island . in the adiabatic regime ( @xmath78 ) , this separatrix is the @xmath114 top side island when @xmath136 ( note this number is somewhat arbitrary ) , and then @xmath125 for @xmath137 , @xmath138 for @xmath139 , and so on .",
    "these are the separatrices that determine the behavior of the initially aligned trajectory .",
    "figures [ influence ] and [ influence87 ] present a different way of visualizing this information . they show the maximum vertical extent of each of the relevant ( `` attached '' to @xmath38 ) separatrices as a function of the stellar spin period @xmath140 , for two different shape functions , with the corresponding values of @xmath79 and @xmath68 given on the top axes .",
    "since , in each case , the initially - aligned trajectory _ starts out _ on the relevant separatrix , its maximum vertical width represents the maximum range of spin - orbit misalignments that the trajectory can cover .",
    "thus , in the non - adiabatic regime the stellar spin has the most `` freedom '' and is able to cover the largest range of @xmath69 . as @xmath79 increases , the spin axis range of excursion becomes progressively more and more limited , though not monotonically so .",
    "there is a clear difference between figures [ influence ] ( @xmath141 ) and [ influence87 ] ( @xmath142 ) : in fig .",
    "[ influence ] the regions of influence of each separatrix are clearly defined and well - separated . on the other hand , in fig .",
    "[ influence87 ] it is not always clear which separatrix dominates the evolution . furthermore , fig .",
    "[ influence87 ] features _ overlaps _ between the different separatrices , which , as we know , is a signature of chaos ( see sl15 ) .",
    "we therefore expect that for @xmath141 the spin dynamics for all stellar rotation periods should be regular and well - behaved , whereas for @xmath142 chaotic behavior may arise for certain ranges of rotation periods .",
    "we now include tidal dissipation in the planet and allow the semi - major axis of the planet to decay , and examine how the non - dissipative regimes discussed in the previous section map onto the final spin - orbit misalignment angle distributions .",
    "we use the standard weak friction model for tidal dissipation ; see sal14 for details .    as the planet s semi - major axis decreases due to tidal dissipation , the stellar spin precession rate increases ( eq .  [ alpha0 ] ) .",
    "the lk precession rate also increases , but not as dramatically , leading to an overall gradual increase in both @xmath79 and @xmath68 .",
    "in addition , as the semi - major axis decays , the shape of the lk orbit changes , with the minimum eccentricity of the lk cycles slowly increasing ( see section 3.1 of asl16 ) ; thus , the shape functions @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 that drive the stellar spin dynamics also slowly change in time .",
    "all of these changes , however , are slow enough for the system to be treated as `` quasi - static '' : for any given lk cycle the spin dynamics of the initially - aligned trajectory is still governed by the non - dissipative hamiltonian , as described in the previous section . however , over the orbital decay time ( involving many lk cycles ) , the coefficients ( @xmath68 , @xmath79 , @xmath143 , @xmath144,@xmath145,@xmath146 ) in the hamiltonian slowly change , and the background non - dissipative phase space slowly evolves through a sequence similar to that depicted in figs .",
    "[ samplephasespaces ] , [ influence ] and [ influence87 ] .",
    "there are two consequences of this slow evolution of the hamiltonian coefficients .",
    "first , since at any given time the system is still governed by a hamiltonian , a ( non - chaotic ) trajectory still can not cross a separatrix ( unless it has no choice  more on this later ) .",
    "the implication is that if a trajectory starts out inside a certain separatrix , its behavior will continue to be governed by that ( slowly evolving ) separatrix .",
    "second , because the system evolves so gradually ( or _ adiabatically _ - not to be confused with the adiabatic regime ! ) , an adiabatic invariant emerges : the area enclosed by a trajectory in the @xmath147 space is an approximately conserved quantity .",
    "together , these two ideas ( avoidance of separatrix crossings , and conservation of area ) are all that is necessary to understand the dissipative system .",
    "thus , in principle , knowing what separatrix governs the behavior of the initially - aligned system at @xmath148 , plus the knowledge of how that separatrix changes under the influence of tidal evolution , should be enough to determine the fate of the trajectory .",
    "the above considerations indicate that the governing separatrix at @xmath148 determines the fate of an initially aligned system .",
    "the initial separatrix is specified by the parameters ( see section 4.3 )    expect that all possible outcomes of the system may be classified using these two parameters .",
    "we begin by repeating the experiment of section [ nondiss ] , including the influence of tides and numerically integrating the system until the planet orbit decays and circularizes .",
    "we select two initial ( @xmath148 ) `` shapes '' for the lk orbit by setting @xmath100 , @xmath149 au ( the initial semi - major axis ) , @xmath102 au , and either @xmath103 or @xmath104 . for @xmath150 ,",
    "the `` shape '' of the orbit slowly evolves ( as the semi - major axis shrinks ) . as in section [ nondiss ] , we vary the stellar spin period ( which remains constant throughout the tidal evolution ) .",
    "we set @xmath151 and plot @xmath152 , the final spin - orbit misalignment angle , as a function of the stellar spin period in figure [ variablep ] .",
    "as before , we cover a somewhat unphysical range of stellar spin periods in order to capture all possible behaviors and outcomes .",
    "five distinct categories of outcomes in fig .",
    "[ variablep ] can be identified :    ( * i * ) the distinct bimodal distribution at very high spin periods ( @xmath153 days and @xmath154 days in fig .",
    "[ variablep ] upper and lower panels , respectively ) ;    ( * ii * ) the unimodal , monotonically decreasing distribution at high to intermediate spin periods ( @xmath155 days in fig .",
    "[ variablep ] , upper panel ) ;    ( * iii * ) the region of wide - spread chaos ( @xmath156 days in fig .",
    "[ variablep ] lower panel ) ;    ( * iv * ) the diagonally striated pattern of spin - orbit misalignments at low and very low spin periods ( @xmath157 days in fig .",
    "[ variablep ] upper panel ) ; we term this behavior `` adiabatic advection '' and discuss it extensively below ;    ( * v * ) the region of very exceptionally small final misalignments at very low spin periods ( @xmath158 days and @xmath159 days in the upper and lower panels of fig",
    ".  [ variablep ] , respectively ) .",
    "figure [ samplepaths ] illustrates the time evolution for the behaviors ( * i * ) , ( * ii * ) and ( * iv * ) .",
    "we discuss each category of outcomes individually in the following subsections .",
    "we first address the clean bimodal spin - orbit misalignment distribution found at high stellar spin periods in fig .",
    "[ variablep ] ( upper panel ) . in order to understand its origin , we need to know which separatrix governs the behavior of the @xmath151 trajectory at @xmath148 .",
    "two simple clues point to the answer : first , the left panels of fig .  [ samplepaths ] show an example of the time evolution in the bimodal regime , as well as the @xmath148 phase space for that evolution .",
    "we see that the separatrix governing the behavior of the trajectory at @xmath148 is the @xmath114 central island .",
    "second , in fig .",
    "[ variablep ] the bimodal region ends very close to @xmath160 , i.e. at the stellar spin period for which at @xmath148 we have @xmath123 . from section [ nondiss ] ,",
    "we know that @xmath123 corresponds to the transition between the non - adiabatic and adiabatic behavior , and that at @xmath123 the governing separatrix for the initially aligned system switches from being the @xmath114 center island to the @xmath114 top island ( see fig .",
    "[ samplephasespaces ] and fig .  [ influence ] ) .",
    "thus , the bimodality found at high stellar spin periods in fig .",
    "[ variablep ] corresponds to the initially non - adiabatic regime .    to understand why the outcome is bimodal",
    ", we now need to know two things : how the @xmath114 center separatrix changes in time ( due to tidal dissipation ) , and how the trajectory interacts with it .",
    "the @xmath114 center separatrix evolves in time ( fig .",
    "[ samplepaths ] , left , the third panel from the top ) in a way exactly analogous to the sequence shown in figs .",
    "[ samplephasespaces ] and [ influence ] : initially the separatrix is attached to @xmath38 . as tidal dissipation acts to reduce the semi - major axis and increase @xmath79 and @xmath68",
    ", the separatrix detaches from @xmath38 and slowly shrinks . on the other hand ,",
    "the actual trajectory can not shrink , due to the aforementioned adiabatic invariance of the area it encloses in the phase space .",
    "its initial area is set by the area of the separatrix at @xmath148 . at intermediate times",
    "the separatrix actually expands ( analogously to the transition between panels * a * and * b * of fig .",
    "[ samplephasespaces ] ) and the trajectory remains inside the separatrix . after the separatrix detaches and begins to shrink again , there comes a point when the area of the separatrix is equal to the area of the trajectory . at that point ,",
    "the trajectory has no choice but to cross the separatrix .",
    "figure [ bimodality ] illustrates this idea . at time of crossing , the trajectory can cross either the top or the bottom part of the separatrix , depending on its phase .",
    "two trajectories that start very close together can , over time , accumulate enough difference in phase that one ends up exiting through the top , and the other through the bottom .",
    "this is the origin of the bimodality seen in fig .",
    "[ variablep ] .",
    "this `` bifurcation '' phenomenon is analogous to the case of a pendulum whose length is slowly decreased with time . the shorter the pendulum gets , the larger its amplitude of oscillation becomes , until at some point it must transition to circulating rather than oscillating . at that point ,",
    "the pendulum will `` choose '' to circulate either clockwise or counterclockwise  corresponding to a positive or negative conjugate momentum ",
    "depending on its phase at the time of transition .",
    "finally , we note that while the bimodality is very clear and distinct in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ variablep ] , it becomes increasingly disordered at lower periods in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ variablep ] .",
    "this is the onset of widespread chaos that arises from resonance overlaps , as discussed in section [ iatsub ] ( see sl15 ) .      for @xmath161 and @xmath162 , fig .",
    "[ variablep ] ( top panel ) shows a smooth unimodal distribution of final spin - orbit misalignments , with @xmath152 decreasing with decreasing @xmath140 . in section 5.2",
    ", we have already determined that the behavior in this regime must be governed by the @xmath114 top side island .",
    "the middle bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ samplepaths ] shows that this is indeed the case . in order to understand the distribution of the final misalignments ,",
    "we again need to ask how the @xmath114 top separatrix evolves with time , and how the trajectory interacts with it .    based on fig .",
    "[ influence ] , we know that an increase in @xmath79 or @xmath68 leads to a rapid decrease in the width of the @xmath114 top island . on the other hand , again , the actual trajectory area is constant and set by the initial area of the top island .",
    "thus , as soon as any significant semi - major axis decay occurs , the trajectory area will exceed the area of the top island , and the actual trajectory should circulate on the outside of the island . for a circulating trajectory ,",
    "the new conserved area becomes the area between the trajectory and the @xmath163 axis .",
    "thus , as more semi - major axis decay occurs , the trajectory can not move up / down , it can only straighten out , eventually settling on a constant @xmath164 equal approximately to its mean @xmath69 value at the time of decoupling from the top island .",
    "thus , if the top island is initially extended , the final @xmath152 should be ( relatively ) large .",
    "as the stellar spin period decreases , the top island decreases in size ; therefore , @xmath152 gets closer and closer to @xmath53 .    a caveat to the above discussion is the following : further into the adiabatic regime , the assumption that only the @xmath114 hamiltonian determines the spin dynamics becomes increasingly erroneous , since the stellar spin vector now precesses at at rate comparable to the precession of @xmath23 and thus sees more than just the time average of the forcing functions .",
    "thus , although the above discussion is suggestive and sound , the actual behavior of the trajectory can be more random and need not obey these rules .",
    "this is why , for example , the trajectory depicted in the middle column of fig .  [ samplepaths ] actually remains level with , or inside , the top island for most of its evolution .",
    "we term this regime of behavior `` stationary adiabatic '' because the trajectory essentially can not move away from its initial location .",
    "this is to be contrasted with type ( * iv * ) behavior discussed below .",
    "note that type ( * ii * ) behavior need not always be present : for example , there is no such apparent behavior in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ variablep ] .",
    "this is because , in many cases , it can be replaced by wide - spread chaos , as discussed below .      for intermediate values of the stellar spin period , in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ variablep ] we can identify a region of widespread or near widespread in the final spin - orbit misalignments , as a result of chaotic spin evolution . this type of behavior was extensively studied in sl15 and we give only a short discussion here .",
    "as discussed in sl15 , chaotic behavior often arises from resonance overlaps . in section [ iatsub ] , based on fig .",
    "[ influence87 ] which shows the existence of resonance overlaps for certain spin periods , we suggested that misalignment distributions computed using this particular set of `` shape '' functions should exhibit chaotic regions .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "in fact , there is good agreement between fig .",
    "[ influence87 ] and the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ variablep ] : for example , for @xmath165 days the behavior of the trajectory should be governed by the @xmath125 resonance and this resonance does not overlap with the @xmath114 island .",
    "thus , there is no chaos in this period range .",
    "in general , we expect the appearance of chaos to be correlated with the widths of the resonances .",
    "since the widths of the resonances generally decrease with increasing @xmath166 ( see sl15 ) , we expect the chaotic bands to be confined to lower values of @xmath166 .",
    "we note , however , that we can not readily explain the existence of widespread chaos in the @xmath167 days region of fig .",
    "[ variablep ] .",
    "this is because our resonance overlap analysis ( sl15 ) assumes that the system is already quite adiabatic , so that any non - adiabatic effects can be treated perturbatively . for @xmath167 days",
    "this is not the case , since @xmath166 is close to or less than @xmath66 .",
    "the concept of adiabatic advection was first considered by sl15 in a schematic manner . here",
    "we demonstrate that adiabatic advection indeed applies in the realistic situation of `` lk oscillation + tidal decay '' considered in this paper .",
    "adiabatic advection is a novel way of generating spin - orbit misalignment .",
    "the idea of adiabatic advection is simple : if at @xmath148 the behavior of the @xmath168 trajectory is governed by a resonance with a specific @xmath63 ( @xmath169 ) , then as tidal dissipation reduces the semi - major axis of the orbit , the trajectory can be advected by the governing resonance to non - zero misalignments .",
    "figure [ advection ] shows an example of this behavior : in the top panel , at @xmath148 we see that the trajectory is trapped inside the @xmath138 resonance , which is still `` attached '' to @xmath38 .",
    "over a gyr later , the resonance has detached and moved down significantly , and the trajectory has likewise moved down and remains inside the resonance , producing a significant spin - orbit misalignment .        as another means of looking at the situation",
    ", we note that at the center of the @xmath63-th resonance we have , by definition , @xmath72 .",
    "thus , a trajectory trapped inside the resonance librates about this point ; that is , @xmath170 of such a trajectory should exhibit moderate variation about @xmath53 . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ advection ] , we show that this is indeed the case : @xmath171 oscillates about @xmath53 , indicating that the trajectory is trapped inside the @xmath138 resonance . likewise , the oscillations of @xmath69 never exceed the maximum width of the @xmath138 resonance , demonstrating that the trajectory is always contained inside .",
    "similarly , figure [ advection2 ] shows sample advections by the @xmath125 ( top ) and @xmath172 ( bottom ) resonances . by locating these examples on the @xmath152 vs @xmath140 plot ( fig .",
    "[ variablep ] , upper panel ) , we conclude that each of the diagonally striated lines in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ variablep ] , located at @xmath173 , @xmath174 , etc . , corresponds to advection by a resonance of a different @xmath63 .      for very low ( extremely fast ) spin periods , the systems presented in both panels of fig .",
    "[ variablep ] are fully adiabatic .",
    "( we note that in the particular case of fig .",
    "[ variablep ] the spin periods in this regime are unphysically short ; however , the same behavior can be achieved at more reasonable spin periods by changing the system orbital parameters or planet mass . ) in this regime , the stellar spin vector has no trouble following the planet angular momentum vector as it undergoes lk oscillations , and no spin - orbit misalignment is generated .",
    "we note that , while we understand what happens in this regime , it is difficult to pinpoint its onset , i.e. the value of @xmath140 or perhaps @xmath68 for which it starts .",
    "in the previous two sections , we have focused on numerical experiments that change the spin dynamics in the simplest way possible : by varying the stellar spin period , while keeping all other system parameters fixed .",
    "we would now like to check whether the understanding of the different outcomes for @xmath152 we have developed in the previous sections holds up when we vary some other parameters of the system .",
    "thus , in fig .",
    "[ thetaslfvsi ] we present the distributions of final spin - orbit misalignment angles as a function of the initial orbital inclination @xmath89 , for two values of the stellar spin period and two planet masses .",
    "we find that , indeed , our classification of the misalignment outcomes based on @xmath166 and @xmath175 holds up well . for jupiter - mass planets ,",
    "the outcomes are either bimodal ( type * i * ) or stationary adiabatic ( type * ii * ) , with the transition between the two regimes occuring at @xmath160 , as expected . for the heavier , @xmath176 planets , a chaotic band ( * iii * ) appears at lower inclinations , likely due to resonance overlaps . aside from that , however , in the non - chaotic regions we find that @xmath152 is nearly constant , consistent with the fact that @xmath175 is moderately large and nearly independent of @xmath89 ( as expected based on fig .",
    "[ nmaxvsi ] ) . based on the values of @xmath175",
    ", we infer that the top right panel of fig .",
    "[ thetaslfvsi ] shows an extended region of adiabatic advection by the @xmath138 resonance ( type * iv.2 * behavior ) , whereas the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ thetaslfvsi ] shows a region of advection by the @xmath125 resonance ( type * iv.1 * behavior )",
    ".    finally , taking one step further , we carry out a suite of calculations for the `` lk oscillation + tidal decay '' time evolutions , with various initial conditions and parameters ( different planet masses , stellar spin periods , binary separations , and initial orbital inclinations ) .",
    "we categorize each time evolution according to its misalignment outcome : bimodal ( * i * ) , stationary adiabatic ( * ii * ) , chaotic ( * iii * ) or adiabatically advected ( * iv * ) , and plot these outcomes in the @xmath175 vs @xmath166 space ( fig . [ params ] ) . from this figure , it is clear that our understanding of the different outcomes is sound : at @xmath177 , bimodality dominates ; at @xmath161 but @xmath162 stationary adiabatic behavior is prevalent ; for @xmath161 and @xmath178 , adiabatic advection is dominant , except where the evolution is chaotic , with the chaotic evolution restricted to lower values of @xmath166 .",
    "we conclude that in general , the two parameters , @xmath166 and @xmath175 , completely determine the evolutionary behavior of the spin - orbit misalignment and whether the final misalignment angle of a given system can be high . for @xmath177 ( regime *",
    "i * ) , the final misalignment distribution is bimodal , and thus a system is equally likely to have low misalignment as high misalignment . for @xmath161 but @xmath179 ( regime * ii * ) the system is incapable of achieving a significantly misaligned state . for @xmath161 and @xmath178 a calculation of resonance widths",
    "must be carried out to determine whether the system is chaotic ( * iii * ) or advecting ( * iv * ) , but in general it can be expected that if @xmath166 is relatively high then the system is not chaotic , and will attain non - zero , but strictly prograde and fairly modest , misalignment .",
    "as explained in section [ srfsec ] , a major assumption in the analysis laid out in this paper , as well as in sl15 , is the omission of the extra precession the planet s orbit experiences due to perturbation from the stellar quadrupole .",
    "this omission enables us to considerably simplify the spin dynamics problem by reducing it to a 1d hamiltonian system .",
    "stellar feedback on planet s orbit becomes important if the host star has nearly as much , or more , angular momentum as the planet s orbit ( see eq .  [",
    "eq : soverl ] ) .",
    "thus , one may question whether our analysis is truly applicable to jupiter - mass ( as opposed to heavier ) planets and rapidly rotating stars .",
    "however , in asl16 we have run a comprehensive suite of numerical simulations including stellar feedback on the orbit and all other important effects .",
    "we found that , while under certain conditions the bimodal and stationary adiabatic behaviors expected to dominate for jupiter - mass planets can be disrupted , on the whole , bimodality remains nearly ubiquitous .",
    "we conclude that our classification of the different misalignment evolution modes and outcomes is generally valid .      in this work",
    ", we have assumed that the stellar spin remains constant throughout the proto - hj s tidal decay and circularization . in reality ,",
    "solar - type stars experience significant spindown due to magnetic winds .",
    "this spindown acts to temporarily reduce the strength of the coupling between the stellar spin and the planet orbit , decreasing both @xmath68 and @xmath180 . however , it is still the initial values of these parameters ( @xmath175 and @xmath181 ) that set the qualitative behavior of the system .",
    "some differences in the final value of the spin - orbit misalignment angle @xmath152 due to stellar spindown could be expected , but the regime classification and predictive power should remain unchanged .      in this paper",
    "we have focused on stellar spin dynamics in systems that have no initial spin - orbit misalignment . however , since several ways of generating primordial misalignment have been proposed ( see references in section 1 ) , the dynamics of initially misaligned systems are of potential interest .    although a thorough exploration of the dynamics of initially misaligned systems is beyond the scope of this work , we believe the ideas developed in this paper , particularly the importance of the parameters @xmath166 and @xmath175 , are still applicable to initially misaligned systems .",
    "the fate of such systems should still be determined by the initial phase space of the system and where in that phase space the system is initialized .",
    "for example , for trajectories starting anywhere inside the @xmath114 center island ( see fig .  [ samplephasespaces ] ) , the final outcome should be bimodal , just as for initially aligned systems ; the only difference is that , for an initially misaligned system , the peaks of the bimodal distribution of the final misalignment angle would lie closer to @xmath182 due to the smaller initial area of the trajectory . in fig .",
    "@xmath183 of asl16 we have demonstrated that this is the case .",
    "thus , the frameworks developed in this paper for the special case of initially aligned systems can be easily generalized to systems with arbitrary initial misalignments and phases .",
    "we have developed an analytical theory to explore and classify the various regimes of stellar spin dynamics driven by planets undergoing lidov - kozai migration . in our previous work ( storch & lai 2015 ) we analyzed only the idealized non - dissipative lidov - kozai system in the adiabatic regime ( when the spin precession frequency is higher than the lk oscillation frequency ) and succeeded in explaining the origin of chaotic behavior of stellar spin . in this paper",
    "we have significantly expanded our analysis to include the effects of various short - range forces ( e.g. , apsidal precession of the planet s orbit due to general relativity and tidal bulge ) and considered all possible spin dynamical regimes .",
    "most importantly , we have included tidal dissipation in the planet , which allows us to examine the long - term evolution of the spin - orbit misalignment angle as the planet migrates in semi - major axis and becomes a hot jupiter .",
    "the work presented here provides a solid theoretical understanding for the various pathways toward spin - orbit misalignments as revealed in our extensive numerical simulations ( storch , anderson & lai 2014 ; anderson , storch & lai 2016 ) .",
    "we find that , in general , the behavior of a `` stellar spin + planet + binary '' system with a given set of initial conditions , planet mass , and stellar spin rate is governed primarily by two parameters ( section 4 ) : @xmath68 ( eq .  24 ) , which compares @xmath184 , the average maximum precession frequency of the stellar spin , with the lk eccentricity oscillation frequency , and @xmath79 ( eq .  26 ) , which compares @xmath184 with the averaged rate of change of the planet s orbital angular momentum vector @xmath23 . for @xmath106 ( which implies @xmath185 ) ,",
    "the spin dynamics is in the non - adiabatic regime .",
    "the adiabatic regime ( @xmath78 ) is divided into two sub - regimes with @xmath107 and @xmath127 ( recall that @xmath85 ) .",

    "@xmath79 vary slowly with time , but the fate of the system is entirely determined by the values of these parameters at @xmath148 ( i.e. during the first lk cycle ) .",
    "in general , five distinct spin - orbit evolutionary behaviors and outcomes are possible ( see section 5.1 ) , and fig .  8 ,  13 and 14 summarize these various types of outcomes .",
    "we find that when @xmath177 ( implying @xmath186 ) , the final spin - orbit misalignment distribution is bimodal ( type * i * ) , and thus the system is equally likely to settle into a retrograde or prograde orbit .",
    "when @xmath161 and @xmath162 , the system experiences `` stationary adiabatic '' behavior ( type * ii * ) and can not achieve very high ( retrograde ) misalignments .",
    "when when @xmath161 and @xmath178 , the system is either chaotic ( type * iii * ) or experiences `` adiabatic advection '' ( type * iv * ) , wherein it can slowly accumulate a modest amount of spin - orbit misalignment ( never more than @xmath182 ) .",
    "the chaotic regime is typically restricted to lower values of @xmath166 . at very high values of both @xmath166 and @xmath68",
    "the system is fully adiabatic ( type * v * ) and can not accumulate any misalignment .",
    "overall , the theoretical work presented in this paper and in storch & lai ( 2015 ) complements our own numerical monte - carlo studies of hot jupiter formation via lidov - kozai migration in stellar binaries ( storch et al .",
    "2014 ; anderson et al .  2016 ) and those by others ( e.g. fabrycky & tremaine 2007 ; correia et al .  2011 ; petrovich 2015 ) .",
    "our theory provides a framework to understand some of the intriguing numerical results on the final spin - orbit misalignment distributions .",
    "for example , we have shown that the bimodal distribution , seen in some of the simulations of fabrycky & tremaine ( 2007 ) , correira et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and storch et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , arises naturally from a `` bifurcation '' phenomenon associated with the crossing of a separatrix in the phase space ( see section 5.2 ) .",
    "another example is the novel `` resonance advection '' phenomenon ( see section 5.5 ) , which leads to the production of misaligned systems even in `` adiabatic '' systems .",
    "finally , we note that , while we have focused on lidov - kozai migration induced by a stellar binary in this paper , the concepts and methods developed in this paper can also be applied to other high - eccentricity migration scenarios involving planet - planet secular interactions ( e.g. nagasawa et al . 2008 ; wu & lithwick 2011 ; beaug & nesvorn 2012 ; petrovich & tremaine 2016 ; hamers et al .",
