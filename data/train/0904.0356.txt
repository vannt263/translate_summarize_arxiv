    "<S> we investigate directed thermal heat flux across 1d homogenous nonlinear lattices when no net thermal bias is present on average . </S>",
    "<S> a nonlinear lattice of fermi - pasta - ulam - type or lennard - jones - type system is connected at both ends to thermal baths which are held at the same temperature on temporal average . </S>",
    "<S> we study two different modulations of the heat bath temperatures , namely : ( i ) a symmetric , harmonic ac - driving of temperature of one heat bath only and ( ii ) a harmonic mixing drive of temperature acting on both heat baths . </S>",
    "<S> while for case ( i ) an adiabatic result for the net heat transport can be derived in terms of the temperature dependent heat conductivity of the nonlinear lattice a similar such transport approach fails for the harmonic mixing case ( ii ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , for case ( ii ) , not even the sign of the resulting brownian motion induced heat flux can be predicted a priori . </S>",
    "<S> a non - vanishing heat flux ( including a non - adiabatic reversal of flux ) is detected which is the result of an induced dynamical symmetry breaking mechanism in conjunction with the nonlinearity of the lattice dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> computer simulations demonstrate that the heat flux is robust against an increase of lattice sizes . </S>",
    "<S> the observed ratchet effect for such directed heat currents is quite sizable for our studied class of homogenous nonlinear lattice structures , thereby making this setup accessible for experimental implementation and verification . </S>"
