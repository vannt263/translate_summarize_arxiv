    "@xcite recently reported the detection of four fast radio bursts ( frbs ) , discovered in the high galactic latitude region of the high time resolution universe survey  @xcite using the 64-m parks radio telescope at @xmath1 .",
    "the characteristics of frbs can be summarized as follows  @xcite ;    * the dispersion measures are @xmath2 , which implies that the sources are at cosmological distances with redshifts @xmath3 . *",
    "the typical flux is @xmath4 .",
    "times brighter than the four frbs  @xcite . ]",
    "the total emitted energy can be calculated as @xmath5 , if the distance is cosmological and the emission is nearly isotropic . *",
    "the observed durations of the bursts are @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , which indicate that the emission regions are relatively compact , @xmath10 , if they are non - relativistic . *",
    "the observed rate is @xmath11 .",
    "this can be translated into @xmath12 for late - type galaxies , which is roughly @xmath13 of that of core - collapse supernovae  ( ccsne ) , @xmath14 . *",
    "no repeated bursts have been reported thus far , so they may be one - time - only events . * no counterparts in other messengers have been reported .",
    "several possibilities for the progenitors of frbs have been proposed , e.g. , magnetar giant flares  @xcite , sn explosion in a neutron - star  ( ns ) binary system  @xcite , accretion - induced collapse of hypermassive nss into black holes  @xcite , binary ns mergers  @xcite , and evaporation of primordial black holes  @xcite .",
    "multi - messenger follow - up observations are crucial to discriminate between the above models . in this letter",
    "we propose binary white dwarf  ( wd ) mergers as a promising candidate for origin of the frbs .",
    "we consider the coherent emission in the polar region of rapidly rotating , magnetized massive wds formed just after the merger .",
    "observationally , up to 10 % of wds have been confirmed to be magnetized , and @xmath15 1 % of them have a strong magnetic field of @xmath16  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since such strongly magnetized wds are typically more massive than the average of the total population  @xcite , they are considered to be formed by binary wd mergers .",
    "our model can reproduce the main observed characteristics of frbs , such as the energetics , emission duration , and event rate . as an offshoot ,",
    "we predict that some frbs can accompany type ia supernova  ( sn ia ) events .",
    "if the redshift or the distance to individual frbs can be determined by identifying their host galaxies or sn ia counterparts , this could open a new possibility for exploring the cosmological parameters and cosmic reionization history by using the dispersion measure of frbs .",
    "double degenerate binary - wd mergers have been investigated in various contexts .",
    "they are particularly interesting as the progenitors of sne ia  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for non - explosion cases ,",
    "the remnant is expected to be a rapidly rotating , magnetized massive wd .",
    "the delayed accretion from the surroundings may induce a collapse into a ns or a magnetar , which may trigger a short gamma - ray bursts  ( grbs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even if the above explosive phenomena do not occur , the remnant wds , so - called wd pulsars  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , can be significant sources of gev - tev electron - positron cosmic rays during the spin - down period  @xcite , which may explain the electron - positron excesses observed by pamela  @xcite , ams-02  @xcite , fermi  @xcite , hess  @xcite , and magic  @xcite .",
    "finally , gravitational waves from binary wds in the in - spiral and merger phase should be detectable by _ lisa _ and decigo  @xcite .",
    "hence , binary wd mergers may be one of the most interesting targets in the coming era of multi - messenger astronomy , e.g. , with specially designed facilities such as amon  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we show that they are also plausible candidates for cosmological frbs .",
    "first , we show that a binary wd merger can provide the right energy budget for a frb .",
    "we consider a rapidly rotating massive wd formed just after a wd - wd merger",
    ". the rotation velocity can be as high as the mass - shedding limit , @xmath17 , and the angular frequency can be estimated as @xmath18 ( hereafter we use @xmath19 in cgs units ) . in numerical simulations ,",
    "the rotation velocities of the merged wds are a factor of @xmath20 smaller than the above value  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we set the nominal mass of the merged wd as @xmath21 , using the average value @xmath22 for the observed wds  @xcite .",
    "also , as the typical radius , we use @xmath23 , which corresponds to a cold wd with a mass of @xmath24 .",
    "given the possible emission mechanism ( see below ) , the kinetic energy is transferred first into magnetic fields and into electron acceleration , and finally into electromagnetic radiation .",
    "if the merged object rotates differentially , the magnetic field may be amplified by magnetorotational instabilities or dynamo processes  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed ,",
    "numerical simulations show that the magnetic fields are amplified up to @xmath25 after the merger  @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we take @xmath26 as a fiducial surface magnetic - field strength . the total magnetic - field energy outside the wd can then be estimated as @xmath27 thus , a fraction @xmath28 of the energy is enough for the total emitted energy in typical frbs , where the pre - factor @xmath29 is the beaming of the radio emission .",
    "note that the magnetic fields could be amplified further , up to a maximum value at which the local gravitational binding can support them , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the possible transient maximum magnetic - field strength is @xmath31 , which is comparable to the surface field of ordinary ns pulsars .",
    "next , we show how the observed duration of the frbs can be reproduced in our scenario .",
    "the inferred sizes of the emission regions , @xmath32 are relatively small compared with our fiducial wd radius , @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the emission has to originate from a portion of the merged wd .",
    "interestingly , the transverse size of the polar - cap region , @xmath34 for a break - up angular frequency @xmath35 , is in a reasonable range , and the resultant light crossing time , @xmath36 is shorter than the observed ( dispersed ) duration .",
    "the region above the polar - cap is also a plausible site for production of coherent radio emission , as we argue below .",
    "an electric - field potential as large as that of ordinary ns pulsars can be produced via the unipolar induction mechanism  @xcite ; @xmath37 and pair - production avalanches can be triggered in the strong magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "we note that the spin - down luminosity of the magnetized wd , @xmath38 , is significantly smaller than the frb isotropic luminosity @xmath39 .. thus , our scenario requires that the magnetic field energy is transiently released in the polar - cap region via processes such as reconnection .",
    "such processes are in fact generally present in strongly magnetized astrophysical objects  @xcite . for example",
    ", soft gamma - ray repeater or magnetar flares would be rapid transient magnetic dissipation events ( as in our case , the spin - down luminosity of magnetars is also much smaller than the luminosity of such flares ) .",
    "also , solar flares are explained by transient magnetic dissipation events in localized regions on the surface .",
    "they are triggered by the emergence of magnetic fields from the stellar interior , which can have orders - of - magnitude higher values than the average field value  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our case ,",
    "if the inner magnetic field of , e.g. , @xmath40 , is convectively transported up into a polar cap region of volume @xmath41 , the corresponding energy budget becomes @xmath42 , which is enough for a frb .",
    "the dissipation timescale would be given by equation ( [ eq : time ] ) , which determines the injection timescale of electron bunches into the polar region ( see below ) , reproducing the observed duration .",
    "next , let us consider the event rate .",
    "reasonable estimates of the galactic wd - wd merger rate are in the range @xcite , @xmath43 though the uncertainties are large , e.g. , in the initial mass function , the distribution of the initial separation , and the evolution of the binary during periods of non - conservative mass transfer .",
    "the angular size of the polar cap is relatively small , @xmath44 , which would imply a surface beaming factor @xmath45 .",
    "however , the beaming factor at the emission region is likely larger , @xmath46 .",
    "as shown below , the emission radius has to be an order - of - magnitude larger than the wd radius , e.g. , @xmath47 , for the ghz radio emission to escape the emitter , where a larger beaming factor is expected .",
    "the other factor is the evolution of the wd - wd merger rate , which can be significantly larger at redshifts @xmath48 than the local rate  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . combining all of the above",
    ", the anticipated detection rate can be considered consistent with the observed frb rate .",
    "the frbs are likely coherent emission as indicated by the high brightness temperatures of @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the emission radius . the mechanism would be similar to the radio pulses from ordinary ns pulsars , including giant pulses , whose mechanism is still highly uncertain  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "below we examine one of the promising models for coherent emission , the coherent curvature emission model  @xcite .",
    "let us consider electron bunches forming a shell with an average thickness @xmath51 , a transverse size @xmath50 , a lorentz factor @xmath52 , and an electron density @xmath53 in the observer frame , coasting along a magnetic field with a typical curvature radius @xmath54 .",
    "the width of the emitting shell is determined by the duration of the central engine activity , i.e. , @xmath55 , which would be roughly constant in the observer frame as long as @xmath56 like grb fireballs  @xcite .",
    "the frequency of the curvature radiation is @xmath57 .",
    "thus , in order to explain the observed frequency of @xmath58 ghz , one needs @xmath59    the total luminosity of the curvature radiation from the emitting shell can be expressed as @xmath60 here @xmath61 is the power radiated by each electron , and @xmath62 denotes the maximum number of electrons in a patch producing coherent emission .",
    "the volume of such coherent patches is given by @xmath63 .",
    "we note that @xmath64 corresponds to the radial width of the patch , and only the electrons within a solid angle of @xmath65 can be causally connected due to relativistic beaming .",
    "the number of such coherent patches in the emitting shell can be estimated as @xmath66 . here",
    ", @xmath67 is the total volume of the emitting shell with the beaming factor @xmath29 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath68 to explain the observed frb luminosities , @xmath69 , one needs @xmath70    importantly , only the radio emission at frequencies above the plasma frequency can escape the emitter without converting into plasma waves , i.e. , @xmath71 here @xmath72 is the electron number density in the comoving frame . to satisfy equation ( [ eq : plas ] )",
    ", one needs @xmath73    in addition , the induced compton scattering can prevent coherent emission from being observed  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one can neglect this effect if the relevant timescale for the scattering is longer than the dynamical timescale of the emitter  ( equations ( 42 ) and ( 47 ) of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; @xmath74 here , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 are the flux and the frequency of the photon bunch , and the thermal lorentz factor of the electrons in the comoving frame , respectively . for coherent curvature radiation , @xmath75 can be estimated from @xmath78 , with the radiation density , @xmath79 , and one can set @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "then , the condition ( [ eq : induced_comp_1 ] ) can be written as @xmath82    from equations ( [ eq : fre ] ) , ( [ eq : lum ] ) , ( [ eq : esc ] ) , and ( [ eq : induced_comp_2 ] ) , one can explain the observed characteristics of the frbs by coherent curvature radiation from emitting shells with @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "in this case , the dispersion measure in the emitter @xmath86 is negligible compared to cosmological dispersion .    in our model ,",
    "first , the magnetic fields in the merged wd are amplified in a dynamical timescale @xmath87 after the merger . with a comparable timescale ,",
    "interior magnetic fields emerge on the surface by convection . in the polar - cap region , they are twisted by differential rotations of the surface or magnetic instabilities , which trigger dissipation processes such as reconnection , and inject electron bunches with a timescale of @xmath88 ( equation ( [ eq : time ] ) ) .",
    "the electron bunches are accelerated in the polar electric fields or by the large internal energy as grb fireballs  @xcite .",
    "the electron - positron numbers are multiplied by photon - pair and/or magnetic - pair production as in ns pulsars  @xcite .",
    "these electrons coast along the open magnetic fields , and emit coherent curvature radiation  ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "first , we note that @xmath89 is close to the light cylinder of newly born wd pulsars , @xmath90 . at these radii ,",
    "the polar magnetic field lines become open , which is a plausible site for curvature radiation .",
    "this also means that the beaming factor of the emitting shell is relatively large , e.g. , @xmath46 .    at the emission radius",
    ", the acceleration rate of an electron can be estimated as @xmath91 .",
    "here , @xmath92 is the magnetic - field strength at the emission radius , which can be estimated as @xmath93 for the dipole case . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy loss rate of the electron is @xmath94 . by equating the above two",
    ", the possible maximum lorentz factor is given as @xmath95 , which is high enough .",
    "comparing the required number density , @xmath96 with the goldreich - julian density @xmath97  @xcite , one obtains the necessary multiplicity as @xmath98 although uncertainties in calculating the multiplicity are large , @xmath99 is inferred for relatively young ns pulsars  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". this may also be the case for newly born wd pulsars given that magnetic pair production avalanches can be triggered in the polar region like ns pulsars  @xcite .",
    "in summary , the proposed binary wd merger scenario can potentially explain the main observed characteristics of frbs , including the energetics , duration , and event rate .    in our model , the frbs may be produced only once , multiple events from the same source are likely inhibited for the following reasons .",
    "first , the rapidly rotating wd can settle down in a dynamical timescale via , e.g. , an angular - momentum transfer to the surrounding debris disk .",
    "then the emergence of the inner magnetic field to the polar region would be suppressed , which limits the energy budget for the frb phenomenon .",
    "also , the differential rotation becomes less significant , and the magnetic - field twisting in the polar region , which triggers the energy dissipation via the reconnection , becomes ineffective . finally , the electric potential in the polar region becomes small , and electron bunches with a sufficient multiplicity and lorentz factor are no longer supplied .",
    "a key to identifying the frb progenitor is to detect the counterparts in other wavelengths , which have not been reported so far .",
    "based on our scenario , one may expect x - ray counterparts due to fallback accretion of tidally disrupted matter onto the disk surrounding the merged wd .",
    "numerical simulations set an upper limit for such accretion luminosities as @xmath100 with a duration of @xmath101 for an equal mass binary of @xmath22  @xcite . for a cosmological distance , e.g. , @xmath102 ,",
    "the anticipated flux of @xmath103 is well below the typical trigger threshold of swift bat @xmath104 in @xmath105  @xcite .",
    "however , given the large event rate , one can also expect relatively close events , which are detectable in x rays .",
    "a sn ia is another possible counterpart of an frb in our model . in the so - called double degenerate model ,",
    "a binary wd merger triggers a deflagration and a detonation in some cases , resulting in a thermo - nuclear explosion of the merged wd  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we strongly encourage sn surveys in the field of view of frb radio observations , although no detection does not exclude our model .    if sne ia and/or the host galaxy were to be observed simultaneously with frbs , the redshift and the luminosity distance would be determined independently . by combining the dispersion measure of the frbs ,",
    "one could put unique constraints on cosmological parameters ( since the luminosity distance and the dispersion measure have different dependences on the redshift ) and the cosmological reionization history  @xcite . to this end ,",
    "long - baseline frb observations with a better angular resolution than single dish observations ( @xmath106 ) are important for finding counterparts and host galaxies .",
