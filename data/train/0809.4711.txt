    "since the advent of modern computational facilities classical field theory is one of the most popular approaches to nonequilibrium field theory . the classical approximation to a quantum filed theory is well justified in several cosmological applications ranging form reheating of the postinflationary universe @xcite followed by an evolution through various phase transitions @xcite to the nonlinear evalution of the hypothetical cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "classical methods have also received an increasing amount of attention from the heavy ion community .",
    "the initial evolution of the highly excited gluon plasma in little - bang experiments turns out to be well modelled by classical yang - mills equations @xcite .",
    "the preheating of the inflationary universe was one of the pioneering applications of the nonlinear classical wave equations @xcite .",
    "in the mostly studied chaotic and hybrid inflation scenarios the nonlinear dynamics is driven by an instability , which is parametric or tachyonic , respectively .",
    "instabilities lead to nonperturbatively large occupation numbers , which is a prerequisite for the classical approximation , but it also requires a nonperturbative treatment , which is the actual strength of the classical equations",
    ". the classical simulations of preheating can make estimates on non - gaussian density perturbations @xcite and gravitational wave production @xcite .",
    "nonperturbative methods are especially useful when dealing with nonequilibrium phase transitions in the early universe @xcite .",
    "a typical example where the fields are required to be out of equilibrium is baryogenesis .",
    "a second strength of the classical approximation is that equilibrium is not a prerequisite . solving the real time yang - mills equations with far - from - equilibrium initial conditions one could gain access to the evolution of the chern - simons number @xcite . for this to accomplish the third strength of the classial equations",
    "has been exploited : its preservation of gauge invariance under time - independent transformations .",
    "the fourth strength of the classical approach is its simplicity and cheap implementation even at large scales .",
    "this feature makes it an excellent tool for studying topological defects , especially the hypothetical network of cosmic strings . to address formation and evolution of defect networks very different length scales have to be properly incorporated into one numerical computation",
    "this situation is getting worse in an expanding universe , but in the classical setting these calculations are still affordable @xcite . in principle",
    ", one could take the zero - width limit and solve the nambu - goto equations @xcite . for fundamental strings",
    "this is a natural procedure , but for strings which are topological defects , microscopic physics plays a significant role in the decay mechanism of strings @xcite .",
    "explicit calculations have been made in the context of gauge strings in the abelian higgs model @xcite , global @xcite and semilocal strings @xcite as well as domain walls @xcite .",
    "the relevance of these calculations have been recently highlighted by the discovery of possible traces of cosmic strings in the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "besides of the cosmological interest classical field theory simulations are also used on the subatomic scale : the early evolution of the gluon plasma formed in heavy ion collisions can be described by by classical yang - mills equations @xcite .",
    "this facilitates a nonperturbative description of the glasma , i.e. the intermediate state after the melting of the color glass condensate prior to thermalisation to quark gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "the produced nonabelian plasma is highly anisotropic , and as such , it is subject to instabilities @xcite .",
    "classical methods have proved very useful for giving a quantitative account on the isotropisation driven by these weibel instabilities @xcite . alternatively",
    ", one can replace the hard sector of the field theory by classical particles represented by a set of vlasov equations on the background of soft classical fields @xcite .",
    "finally we point out that the ergodicity of the classical field trajectories makes the classical simulations an essential and robust method for studying thermal classical lattice systems in real time . in statistical field theory",
    "one averages over an ensemble of initial field configurations and observes e.g. the real time dynamics of symmetry breaking @xcite , with possible formation of quasistable localised excitations , dubbed oscillons @xcite .",
    "the presence of long - lived oscillons induces resonant nucleation , and they become a driving force of first order phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the classical approximation has severe limitations , however .",
    "the continuum equilibrium theory is plagued by rayleigh - jeans divergences , and a renormalisation with local counterterms is not possible in general @xcite .",
    "moreover , the counterterms are temperature dependent , which makes a consistent out - of - equilibrium renormalisation impossible .",
    "this means that classical theories need an intrinsic cut - off scale , which , in practice , sets the spacing of the lattice discretisation . from whatever initial ensemble of classical fields",
    "the straightforward integration of the euler - lagrange equations of the theory brings the systems towards an equilibrium defined by the classical hamiltonian .",
    "this equilibrium differs from a true quantum thermal state , but the difference is negligible for soft modes and only affects hard excitations . in terms of particle numbers",
    "a system is considered in the classical domain if the occupancy is sufficiently high .",
    "the infrared physics , which is mostly sensitive to nonperturbative phenomena , is usually not vulnerable to quantum effects , but on the ulraviolet end of the spectrum one has to balance between discretisation errors and miscalculated hard degrees of freedom .",
    "even if we start from an infrared dominated initial condition , hard modes are becoming increasingly dominant on the course of thermalisation and the classical system automatically leaves its domain of validity .",
    "there is an other first principles approach to nonequilibrium field theory , which shares none of the aforementioned shortcomings .",
    "it has been numerically demonstrated that even a low order truncation of the two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) effective action yields equations of motion , capable of describing irreversible quantum dynamics , including thermalisation @xcite .",
    "this powerful resummation technique can be directly applied to relevant problems in cosmology @xcite or in hot abelian gauge theories @xcite , as well as in the many - body theory of ultracold condensates @xcite . yet , for non - abelian gauge fields the more complete 3pi resummation becomes necessary @xcite , and for a setting with topological defects",
    "an inhomogeneous treatment is inevitable @xcite .",
    "being both extensions expensive , we will have to fall back in these cases to the classical approximation and use 2pi to benchmark it where their domains of validity overlap .",
    "these precision tests in the @xmath0 scalar model had the reassuring result that particle numbers as small as @xmath1 already put the system into the classical domain @xcite .",
    "there is , however , another important deficiency of the classical approximation .",
    "all the applications listed in the previous paragraphs were entirely limited to bosonic fields .",
    "classical simulations of both baryogenesis and heavy ion collisions could benefit from a direct modelling of quarks , if that were feasable .",
    "as dimensional reduction suggests , fermionic fields are purely quantum degrees of freedom , just like the non - static components of a bosonic field theory .",
    "the classical field theory does have bosonic fluctuations , and in the absence of quantum degrees of freedom , bosonic particle production is automatically modelled as the excitation of the fluctuating background .",
    "the analagous production of fermions , however , is not mapped onto any existing degree of freedom .",
    "the inclusion of fermions is rather trivial in the 2pi framework , where bosonic quantum fluctiatons interact with fermionic quantum fluctuations , and an explicit calculation has been presented to show the real - time simultaneous onset of fermi - dirac and bose - einstein distributions @xcite .",
    "however , when dealing with non - abelian gauge fields , or strong inhomogeneities , we will need to resort to some extension of the classical theory .",
    "this extension is the actual topic of this paper . in this paper",
    "we build on the ideas of aarts and smit @xcite and by `` integrating the fermion determinant '' we solve an effective theory for the classical scalar background .",
    "we go beyond the recent applications in refs .",
    "@xcite by including the back reaction in our calculation .",
    "our efficient solution technique enables us to go beyond 1 + 1 dimensions in the simulations .",
    "in section [ sec : hartree ] we review the standard description of the fermionic fluctuations .",
    "then in section [ sec : stochastic ] we introduce a stochastic approach , which provides us a more efficient algorithm than the so far known mode function expansion . in section [ sec : therm ] we investigate the capabilities of this semiclassical approximation for describing irreversible phenomena , such as damping and thermalisation .",
    "we continue with a bit more exotic application involving oscillons in section [ sec : oscillon ] and discuss the possible future applications of this semiclassical scheme section [ sec : discussion ] . the spinor representations that we actually used in our numerics we give in appendix  [ sec : spinors ] . in a naively discertised lattice field theory",
    "the number of fermion flavours is doubled in each space - time direction .",
    "we discuss the possible elimination of the extra flavours in appendix  [ sec : doublers ] .",

    "is linear @xmath12 which manifests on the level of diagrams in the simple rule that fermion propagator lines never cross .",

    "contrary to ref .",
    "@xcite , in this approach we solve equations with divergences , which cancel in the end result .",
    "this makes the final removal of the cut - off impossible , and such a calculation is usually error - prone close to the continuum limit .",
    "but in this case we solve a lattice field theory classically and it makes no sense to even approach the continuum limit .",
    "this renormalisation makes sure that the fermionic vacuum does not alter the bosonic vacuum , but the classical divergences from the closed bosonic loops are as dangerous as before .    by construction ,",
    "fermions have now no impact on a static bosonic field , but there is a damping rate for dynamical fields , which is given in the real scalar case by @xmath82 for a scalar with mass @xmath83 this evaluates for homogeneous mode to @xmath84 if @xmath85 . the damping rate is directly observable from the numerics . since it is proportional to @xmath8 , it facilitates the measurement of the number of doublers in a lattice implementation .",
    "in eq .  ( [ eq : mfedirac ] ) of the previous section a separate field has to be evolved for each mode @xmath86 and spinor index . on a three - dimensional lattice with @xmath87 sites",
    "this means a coupled set of @xmath88 complex ordinary differential equations .",
    "this relatively high price might explain the fact that in nearly ten years time since the equations have been published no calculation has been carried out beyond 1 + 1 dimensions .    an elegant way of performing integrals with high dimensionality is to employ monte - carlo techniques .",
    "importance sampling is a prominent example in statistical field theory , though its formulation for fermionic fields is troublesome because of the grassmann nature of these degrees of freedom .",
    "nevertheless , there have been promising news to the apparently impossible simulations at finite chemical potential @xcite or in real time @xcite .",
    "in fact , the situation in our semiclassical nonequilibrium setting is much simpler than in euclidean field theory simulations . we know everything about the initial fermion ensemble and we will set up evolution equations for the members of this ensemble . at any later time",
    "an averaging over these members will tell the propagator @xmath14 .",

    "if , however , the back - scattering of the produced fermions to bosons becomes relevant , this semiclassical approximation will no longer be applicable .",
    "one can actually monitor the fermion particle numbers to check for relevance of ( the absence of ) back - scattering .",
    "we can consider the semiclassical approximation safe if the resulting fermion energy density is small .",
    "however , one of the justifications for the classical approximation is the high bosonic occupancy , which will inevitably generate an energy transfer into the fermionic fields . in such cases",
    "the approximation will break down within a short time , which is likely to be the damping time we discussed in the previous section .    in the this section we turn to applications where classicality has an other justification .",
    "if the particle content is very low and but there is dilute network of classical structures , such as topologial defects , their evolution can be well described by the non - linear wave equations . the decay of these structures into particles is mapped to the production of classical waves ( `` ripples '' ) by the classical equations .",
    "as this mostly happens in the ultraviolet , the classical approach is not justified for describing particle production , in contrast to its usefulness in the case of the macroscopic networks , like cosmic strings .",
    "we addressed this deficiency of the classical approximation in ref .",
    "@xcite , where we introduced a stochastic approach to the bosonic mean - field approximation , similar to the method presented in this paper . we found that mimicking the quantum distribution by an analogous classical noise ( following the so called `` just - the - half '' prescription ) introduces undesired time - dependent renormalisation effects to the effective potential .",
    "instead we solved the inhomogeneous mean - field equations and found that on the macroscopic level , the decay channel into quantum particles plays negligible role , whereas it on microscopic scale we found deviations .",
    "our numerical analysis suggested that oscillons , which are one of the classical decay products of topological defects @xcite , are the primary sources of quantum particles , while the direct radiative decay of a defect network is suppressed as predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to better understand how oscillons decay quantum mechanically we reproduce one of the experiments in ref .",

    "we put 16 incoherent oscillons with small random velocities in a box with @xmath153 .",

    "this estimate is in harmony with direct measurements @xcite .    in this paper",

    "we plan to investigate the evolution of cosmic strings for such contributions from quantum degrees of freedom in a future publication .",
    "in this paper we propose a low - cost integration scheme for the fermionic path integral , which leads to equations that are equivalent to the mean - field approximation studied earlier by aarts and smit .",
    "these equations also follow from the large-@xmath8 expansion of the 2pi effecitve action . the computational efficiency of this scheme allowed us to do simulations beyond 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "this stochastic method is a generalisation of our earlier technique developed for scalars in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we calculate several test cases on a scalar example and study what the irreversible phenomena can be captured by this simple method .",
    "we confirm that the fermions , once created , can no longer scatter on each other , but this is not the only obstacle that hinders thermalisation .",
    "the damping of the classical oscillations are correctly given account for , but the back - scattering of the fermions into bosons is absent . in the language of the mode function expansion ,",
    "fermions ( and also other quantum fluctuations on the hartree level ) are represented by far more dynamical variables that the background . if these variables strive for classical equipartition ( as usual in a coupled set of non - linear differential equations )",
    ", the energy left in the background is negligible .",
    "this suppression of the background becomes stronger with higher dimensionality , and was less relevant in former 1 + 1 dimensional calculations .    as it was remarked in ref .",
    "@xcite the fermion spectrum can become close to thermal , and this raised hope that the inhomogeneous hartree approximation is still capable to account for an approximate thermalisation .",
    "it is , however , more likely , that it is the praticle production mechanism that brings the fermions close to equilibrium , rather than scattering .",
    "even though scattering can not drive the fermions towards equilibrium , we expect that the back - reaction of the often not - far - from - thermal fermion field has an approximately thermal back - reaction due to prethermalisation of the fermionic current @xcite , and the lack of thermalisation has little impact on the background field .",
    "this assumption becomes even more plausible if we assume that the fermions leave the scene , once created .    in some physical situations",
    "it is difficult for a fermion to leave .",
    "if we apply the presented scheme to the yang - mills equations , and solve the semiclassical chromodynamics , it will be difficult for fermions to be reabsorbed by the plasma .",
    "this puts jet - quenching outside of the range of validity . but a semiclassical simulation of the freeze - out of the plasma is not ruled out by the aformentioned deficiencies .",
    "the numerical calculation of the fermion spectrum in baryogenesis scenarios is a more viable application .",
    "if baryogenesis is driven by a first order phase transition , the presented equations can give account for cp violation as well as the departure from equilibrium without relying on gradient expansion , and thus , allowing for thin walls .",
    "for the subsequent thermalisation , however , one has to make further assumptions .",
    "the scheme is best applicable for systems with low particle numbers and genuine inhomogeneities , like a dilute network of topological defects , such as cosmic strings . in this context fermion production is local , and the produced particles spred in space .",
    "this results in small praticle numbers , and we expect that the lack of thermalisation will introduce very little distortion into the back - reaction .    in conclusion , for cases where the inhomogeneities in the background are ment to be `` particles '' , a big volume is less relevant , and other techniques , such as the 2pi effective action on a homogeneous ensemble may be more favourable . for the large - scale classical simulations with inhomogeneous classical structures ,",
    "however , the inhomogeneous 2pi approach would be beyond feasibility .",
    "in such situations , the hartree approximation already includes the leading quantum corrections , as well as endorses fermions .",

    "the problem of fermion doubling inevitably arises in any lattice implementation . since almost",
    "all numerical analyses of classical field theories use lattice discretisation , an extension that incorporate fermions will also share this heritage .",

    "we simply used the naive fermion discretisation and introduce an effective flavour number , in which we compensate for a pair of doublers in each spatial direction .",
    "we could do this since in our simple model there are no anomalous diagrams where doubling fermions could cancel .",
