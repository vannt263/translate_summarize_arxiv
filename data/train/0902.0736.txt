    "the evolution of cosmic star formation rate density ( sfrd ) and the stellar mass function are two key components required to describe galaxy evolution , representing current and past star formation activities respectively .",

    "1998 ; steidel et al . 1999 ; arnouts et al . 2005 ; schiminovich et al . 2005 ; bouwens et al . 2006 , 2007 ; ly et al . 2007 ) suggest that the global sfr density peaks at @xmath17 . the study of the build - up of stellar mass density ( e.g. , dickinson et al . 2003 ; rudnick et al .",
    "2003 ; glazebrook et al .",
    "2004 ; fontana et al .",
    "2004 ) also indicates that the redshift range @xmath17 is the phase of massive galaxy formation , being the epoch of the strongest star formation .",
    "most studies are in overall agreement that star formation decreases by a factor of 10 to 20 from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .    while the redshift range @xmath20 is expected as the epoch of the strongest star formation , measurements of the sfr density over this redshift range are uncertain . first , most of the significant spectral features useful for redshift identification are in the near - infrared ( 0.72@xmath21 m ) at @xmath22 , so few galaxies at @xmath182 have spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "second , the commonly used rest - frame ultraviolet or mid - infrared selections can be severely biased toward relatively unobscured or obscured star - forming galaxy populations . therefore we performed a nir spectroscopic survey using redshifted h@xmath3 emission lines at @xmath22 , to select star - forming galaxies at the corresponding redshifts .",
    "h@xmath3 is known to be a robust measure of star formation , which is less affected by dust extinction compared to uv continuum ( e.g. , see review of kennicutt 1998 ) . at redshift @xmath20 ,",
    "grism spectroscopy using near infrared camera and multi - object spectrograph ( nicmos ) onboard hubble space telescope ( hst ) offers a unique tool to sample h@xmath3-selected star - forming galaxies .",
    "the first results of a nicmos grism parallel survey were published using hst cycle 7 data ( mccarthy et al . 1999 ) .",
    "operating in pure parallel mode , the survey identified 33 emission - line galaxies over @xmath23 arcmin@xmath2 of randomly selected fields .",
    "the h@xmath3 luminosity function at @xmath241.9 was derived using the identified emission - line galaxies ( yan et al .",
    "hopkins et al.(2000 ) investigate the faint - end of the h@xmath3 luminosity function in more detail by performing deeper pointed grism observations .",
    "this nicmos parallel grism survey resumed after the installation of the nicmos cryocooler and continued until 2005 , including hundreds of observations throughout cycles 12 and 13 .",
    "this extensive amount of new data enables the construction of a new , more robust h@xmath3 luminosity function at @xmath252 .    in this paper",
    ", we present the h@xmath3 luminosity function at @xmath0 .",
    "possible evolution of the luminosity function between redshift 1 and 2 is also investigated , by constructing luminosity functions at @xmath26 and @xmath27 separately . the global star formation rate density inferred by the h@xmath3 luminosity function",
    "is compared with the values from previous studies , in context of the galaxy evolution . throughout this paper",
    ", we use a cosmology with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "all of the data presented in this study have been obtained using camera 3 of nicmos onboard hst , taken in pure parallel mode with the g141 grism and the broad - band f110w / f160w filters .",
    "the original nicmos camera 3 image is @xmath31 pixel array with a pixel scale of @xmath32 pixel@xmath5 , providing a field of view of @xmath33 ( @xmath34 arcmin@xmath2 ) .",
    "the observations were performed between october 2003 and july 2004 ( cycle12 ) , july 2004 and january 2005 ( cycle13 ) .",
    "the fields are randomly selected , approximately 10@xmath35 apart from the coordinates of the prime observation .",
    "the total exposure times for different fields vary from 768 seconds to 48000 seconds , while typical integration times ranged from @xmath36 to @xmath37 seconds .",
    "every observed field has at least three dithered frames . to identify objects that are responsible for the spectra in slitless grism images",
    ", we obtained f160w ( @xmath38-band ) direct images before or after taking the grism images .",
    "for all cycle 13 and several cycle 12 fields , we also obtained f110w ( @xmath39-band ) direct images ( for the information about the reduction and analysis of f110w and f160w direct images , see henry et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "the g141 grism covers a wavelength range of 1.1 to 1.9@xmath21 m , with mean dispersion of @xmath40 m pixel@xmath5 .",
    "the resolving power @xmath41 is a function of the observing condition , including the variation of point spread function ( psf ) due to the changes in the optical telescope assembly and longer term changes in the internal structure ( see mccarthy et al .",
    "1999 for details ) .",
    "according to the previous observations , the nominal resolution is low : @xmath42200 ( noll et al . 2004 ) .",
    "thus , most of the lines are unresolved in this study . assuming h@xmath3 emission line redshifted to @xmath20 and @xmath43 at @xmath44 m , the smallest detectable rest - frame intrinsic equivalent width is 5075@xmath45 , although there is some additional uncertainty resulting from the unknown relative strength of the [ nii ] to the h@xmath3 line .",
    "the data reduction follows similar steps to previous studies using nicmos grism data ( e.g. , mccarthy et al .",
    "1999 ; hopkins et al . 2000 ) , including high background subtraction , one - dimensional spectra extraction , and wavelength / flux calibration .",
    "we start from the calibrated output ` * cal.fits ` files from the hst archive , which are corrected for bias and dark current removal , linearization , and cosmic ray rejection .",
    "flat - fielding is not included in this stage but is done after the extraction of one - dimensional spectrum , since the flat - field strongly depends on the wavelengths in case of nicmos grism . for images taken during the south atlantic anomaly , we apply saa correction using ` saa_clean ` . after the saa correction and the correction for any remaining differences in bias levels between each pedestal quarters ,",
    "the main part of the data reduction is the removal of the high sky background at near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "we use two different methods to make the sky frame that will be subtracted , and select the better method for each case : i ) median - combining all image frames taken and ii ) median - combining only those image frames taken at close dates with the image frame that needs sky subtraction . for several fields taken during the period in which the sky background changes rapidly",
    ", the highly uneven background is not removed completely with the first method . in such cases ,",
    "we use the second method to make a sky frame . at lease",
    "9 frames taken at close dates were used to construct the sky frame , to prevent the increase in background uncertainty .",
    "once the sky frame for each image is determined , the sky frame is subtracted from the observed images .",
    "note that the construction of sky frames using image frames taken at close dates is newly introduced while previous studies used only one sky frame constructed by median - combination of all image frames ( e.g. , mccarthy et al . 1999 ) .",
    "after the sky subtraction , we grouped the frames according to their 139 unique parallel fields and registered each group onto one plane . in order to measure the offsets between the dithered frames",
    ", we shift each frame by a series of @xmath46 , @xmath47 ( @xmath480.1 pixel ) shift values , subtract the shifted one from the reference frame , and find the shifts that minimize the difference through the iteration .",
    "the final shifts in x / y directions are less than 3 pixels in general . during this process ,",
    "the bad pixels and hot pixels are masked out .",
    "for bad pixel masks , we combine the permanent bad pixel mask for the nicmos camera 3 and the data quality flag image associated with the nicmos raw data cube . some `` warm '' pixels , which are missed in bad pixel masks are identified by eye and added in the final mask for correction .",
    "final cleaned , sky - subtracted , coordinate - registered frames are added to construct the reduced mosaic two - dimensional image for each pointing .    from the reduced two - dimensional spectra image , we extract one - dimensional spectrum and perform flux / wavelength calibration using the ` nicmoslook ` software developed by stec - f ( freudling 1999 ) .",
    "we first identify the position of the emission - line galaxy in the direct image ( f160w ) through visual inspection on the two - dimensional spectra image . from the interactively determined position and size of the object ,",
    "we define the extraction aperture and the background region considering the offset between the grism and the direct image , and extract the spectrum .",
    "we apply a correction for the wavelength dependent pixel response to the extracted spectrum using an inverse sensitivity curve . for wavelength calibration",
    ", we first extract the spectrum of a bright point source in each grism image before extracting the spectrum of any emission - line galaxies .",
    "the bright point sources reproduce the significant cutoff in short / long limits ( 1@xmath21 m , 1.9@xmath21 m ) in inverse sensitivity curve with a high @xmath49 , because stellar spectra are flat in the g141 bandpass .",
    "final wavelength calibration for the spectrum of emission - line galaxy is done by adjusting slight offsets between the spectrum and the overlaid sensitivity curve .",
    "note that sometimes the wavelength calibration varies for different locations in a camera field of view .",
    "the uncertainty in wavelength calibration due to the remaining distortion effect is about @xmath50 m , i.e. , in general there is a systematic redshift determination error of @xmath51 .",
    "also , there are a few cases where the emission - line object lies near the edge of the image . in these cases ,",
    "the counterpart of the object is not found in the associated direct image , which causes a large uncertainty in wavelength calibration up to @xmath52 m .",
    "the redshift uncertainty for an object lying at the image edge is @xmath53 . finally , the extracted one - dimensional spectrum is flux - calibrated by dividing the pixels values ( [ dn / s ] ) by the g141 grism inverse sensitivity curve ( [ dn / s]/jy ) .",
    "our reduction method is comparable with that used in hubble legacy archive ( freudling et al .",
    "the consistency between our spectra and the reduced spectra in hubble legacy archive confirms the existence of emission lines for the sample galaxies , although we find matches for only a few objects which are the most luminous .",
    "most of our emission line galaxies are relatively faint , and are therefore missed by the less rigorous reduction in the hubble legacy archive .",
    "this work is an extension of the previous nicmos grism survey for emission - line galaxies from the cycle 7 parallel observation program ( mccarthy et al .",
    "1999 ) , performed during cycle 12 and cycle 13 . in cycle 12 ,",
    "our survey targeted 130 different coordinates with different exposure times . from the original 130 fields ,",
    "26 are excluded in the final analysis since the fields are either too crowded ( i.e. , the stellar densities are over @xmath54 arcmin@xmath55 , m31/smc fields ) , have high galactic foreground extinction ( taurus molecular cloud fields ) , or are damaged by latents produced by very bright objects observed just before the image exposure . in cycle 13 , we excluded 10 fields out of the 45 fields initially targeted for the same reasons . therefore the total survey area is @xmath1 arcmin@xmath2 , covering 139 different fields randomly distributed over the sky .",
    "we compare the exposure times of these 139 useable parallel fields taken during cycles 12 and 13 with the earlier cycle 7 survey in figure [ fig : data]a .",
    "although the number of the deepest exposures is not significantly increased in cycles 12 and 13 , the number of total pointings is nearly double those from the cycle 7 ( cycle 7 data comprises 85 pointings over @xmath56 arcmin@xmath2 ; mccarthy et al .",
    "in particular , the number of pointings with medium exposure times ( 200010000 seconds ) have increased substantially .",
    "we illustrate the distribution of @xmath57 line flux limits in figure [ fig : data]b .",
    "the rms noise in spectra - free regions is measured over a 4-pixel aperture for extracting one - dimensional spectrum .",
    "thus , this `` line flux limit '' reflects the flux limit of a line added to the underlying continuum . as is expected from the exposure time comparison between cycle 7 and cycle 12/13 ( figure [ fig : data]a ) , the line flux limits distribution of our data shows similar trend with that of cycle 7 . though it is true that the fields with longer exposure time have fainter line flux limits , the depth of an image is not necessarily a simple function of the exposure time of an image .",
    "instead , the flux limit is much more dependent on the flatness of the background , i.e. , non - poisson noise caused by imperfect background subtraction .",
    "therefore , below @xmath57 flux limits , we do nt reliably identify emission lines because significant residuals remain from dark subtraction and other large data artifacts .",
    "we identify the emission - line galaxy candidates on the two - dimensional spectra image through visual inspection , prior to the extraction of a one - dimensional spectrum using ` nicmoslook ` ( section 2.2 ) .",
    "we carefully compare the grism images and the direct images , identifying the galaxies in the direct images that are responsible for the emission - line in the spectra .",
    "we cross - check this method by identifying the same emission - line galaxies among multiple different authors .",
    "some major obstacles in the identification of the emission - lines are the existence of zero - order images , the remaining background patterns , and the occasional image artifact .",
    "the zero - order image appears at a location @xmath58 apart from the end of the first order spectrum , so it can be recognized in most cases through the inspection of the first - order spectrum or the inspection of direct images .",
    "however in the middle portion of the detector , it is difficult to tell whether the point - like feature is a zero - order image or a strong emission - line with faint continuum .",
    "figure [ fig : identify ] shows two typical pairs of direct and grism images in our data and the identified emission - line galaxies .",
    "zero - order images , the first and the second order spectrum , and the identified emission - line features are marked .    over the @xmath1 arcmin@xmath2 surveyed in cycle 12 and cycle 13",
    ", we identify 80 emission - line galaxies . as we mentioned in section 2.3",
    ", we only classify an emission - line as real if the line is significant at @xmath59 levels .",
    "table [ tab : objects ] presents the coordinates , redshifts , line fluxes , observed equivalent widths , and available photometry of all 80 emission - line galaxies .",
    "the emission - line galaxies are distributed over 53 different fields , with 23 fields containing more than one emission - line galaxy .",
    "the most likely candidates for the identified emission lines in our grism survey are hydrogen lines ( h@xmath3 , h@xmath60 ) and oxygen lines ( [ oii ] 3727@xmath45 , [ oiii ] 5007@xmath45 ) redshifted to @xmath61 .",
    "because of the broad wavelength coverage of g141 ( 1.11.9@xmath21 m ) , we would expect to see both [ oiii ] and h@xmath3 in galaxies at @xmath62 and both [ oii ] and [ oiii ] in galaxies at @xmath63 .",
    "only a single line is predicted for h@xmath3 at @xmath64 and [ oii ] at @xmath65 .",
    "except for ten possible cases discussed in section 3.3 , we do not convincingly detect more than one emission line in most of the galaxies .",
    "that is , the derivation of redshift depends on only a single strong emission line in most cases .",
    "we believe that most of these single lines are h@xmath3 considering their large equivalent widths .",
    "we can estimate the possibilities of the emission lines being emission lines other than h@xmath3 using the expected equivalent widths of the lines , since our identification is limited to emission lines with ew ( rest - frame ) @xmath6650@xmath45 .",
    "first , the possibility of h@xmath60 line is removed since the average equivalent widths for h@xmath60 in star - forming galaxies are known to be relatively small ( 5@xmath67 , brinchmann et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the next strongest line after h@xmath3 in terms of equivalent width is [ oii ] 3727@xmath45 line . identifying the emission line as [ oii ]",
    "3727@xmath45 requires the redshift of the object to be @xmath68 .",
    "considering the typical magnitude of our emission - line galaxies , the @xmath69 should be @xmath70 mag if the galaxy is at @xmath71 .",
    "the estimated number of @xmath71 galaxies with @xmath72 over our survey volume is less than two according to the v - band luminosity function of @xmath71 galaxies ( shapley et al .",
    "2001 ) , thus the possible contamination rate by [ oii ] lines at @xmath71 is less than 3 percents ( 2/80 ) .",
    "furthermore , most [ oii ] contaminants will be in the @xmath63 range , where [ oiii ] 5007@xmath45 line should also appear in our spectra .",
    "we suggest this possibility for one object , j033310.66 - 275221.4a presented in figure [ fig : comment ] in section 3.3 .",
    "this object is also included in table [ tab : objects ] since the possibility of the line being [ oii ] instead of h@xmath3 is still uncertain .",
    "finally , the last possibility for contamination is the [ oiii ] 5007@xmath45 line . yet as we mentioned in the previous paragraph , [ oiii ] 5007@xmath45 emission line",
    "is accompanied with either h@xmath3 or [ oii ] 3727@xmath45 at @xmath73 .",
    "therefore the possibility of [ oiii ] being the single , strongest emission line of the galaxy is very low .",
    "besides these strong candidates , lines with longer wavelengths are also possible , including heii @xmath74 .",
    "however , these are not likely due to their weakness and the lack of accompanying nearby lines like [ siii ] at @xmath75 .",
    "the follow - up optical spectroscopy targeting 14 emission - line galaxies presented in mccarthy et al.(1999 ) revealed that 9 of the emission - line galaxies are truly at @xmath252 , supporting the identified emission lines through nicmos grism spectroscopy are mostly redshifted h@xmath3 ( hicks et al .",
    "the remaining 5 sources had no identifiable emission lines and were therefore unconfirmed , but not ruled out . in conclusion , we find that contamination from other emission lines is small ( @xmath76% ) .",
    "nonetheless , we include this source of uncertainty in the derivation of the h@xmath3 luminosity function ( section 4 ) .",
    "in addition to mis - identification of emission lines , there is also a possibility of contamination by h@xmath3 emission from agn .",
    "we estimated the fraction of these contaminants using agn luminosity function at similar redshifts and magnitudes . at @xmath77 , the number density of type-1 agn with @xmath78 mag",
    ", corresponding to the median magnitude of our emission - line galaxies , is @xmath79 mpc@xmath7 ( bongiorno et al .",
    "our effective survey volume is @xmath80 mpc@xmath81 at this redshift range , which would indicate 34 agns in our survey .",
    "this is actually the lower limit on the agn number density in our data , since for a given @xmath38-band continuum magnitudes , agn candidates are likely to be brighter and thus easier to be included in the grism survey sample compared to normal star - forming galaxies , due to the larger intrinsic equivalent width of the h@xmath3 line . using the follow - up optical spectroscopy of the objects selected in the previous nicmos grism survey ,",
    "hicks et al.(2002 ) suggested a new diagnostic for seyfert 1 galaxies with l(h@xmath3 ) and h@xmath3 equivalent width .",
    "we have five objects within the conservative cut of log(l@xmath82)@xmath83 erg s@xmath5 and ew(h@xmath3)@xmath84 , while we have five more objects with ew(h@xmath3)@xmath84 and the luminosities of @xmath85log(l@xmath82)@xmath86 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "we assume these numbers represent the possible uncertainties caused by agn contamination .    to summarize , i ) all the galaxies in the brightest bin ( log(l@xmath82)@xmath87 erg s@xmath5 ) can be considered agns according to the criteria of hicks et al.(2002 ) .",

    "these uncertainties are included in table [ tab : lf_val ] , and in the derivation of the h@xmath3 luminosity function .",
    "since h@xmath3 and [ nii ] 6583@xmath45 , 6548@xmath45 are not deblended at the resolution of nicmos grism , we correct the derived h@xmath3 luminosity for [ nii ] contribution when we use h@xmath3 luminosity as measures of star formation rate .",

    "we do not apply any dust extinction correction for the star formation rate of individual galaxies or our derivation of h@xmath3 luminosity function , although @xmath96 mag is expected for h@xmath3-selected star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , kennicutt 1992 ) .",
    "we only use this h@xmath3 extinction correction for our estimates of star formation rate density evolution ( see section 5 ) .",
    "the redshifts of our sample galaxies span the range of @xmath0 , with a steep decrease at the low - redshift ( @xmath97 ) and high - redshift ends ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "this is expected from the sharp end of the g141 grism response curve .",
    "the median redshift is @xmath99 .",
