    "gravitational wave observations will enable an unprecedented view of the cosmos thanks to interferometric detectors such as the forthcoming second - generation ground - based detectors ligo , virgo , and kagra  @xcite , third - generation future ones like the einstein telescope  @xcite , and space - based ones like elisa and decigo  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are also good prospect of detection of gravitational waves using several pulsar timing arrays that are organized in the international pulsar timing array collaboration  @xcite .",
    "when the second generation of ground - based detectors becomes fully operational and reaches the designed sensitivity , these instruments will be truly tools of astronomical discovery . for compact objects ( neutron stars and black holes )",
    ", we will be able to determine from gravitational - wave observations properties such as their masses , radius , rotation rates , and , for the case of neutron stars , the structure of matter itself ( i.e. equation of state )  @xcite .",
    "another remarkable capability of gravitational - wave observations is their potential to validate whether general relativity is indeed the correct classical theory of gravity and to put constraints to alternative theories  @xcite . in summary ,",
    "the detection and characterization of gravitational waves will provide insights on a plethora of physical phenomena , insights that will complement our knowledge obtained from particle accelerators and electromagnetic observations .",
    "processes in compact objects associated with strong magnetic fields are an example of physical phenomena for which only multi - messenger observations provide a complete picture .",
    "for instance , in the case of the giant flares in soft gamma - ray repeaters , evidence points to magnetars ( strongly magnetized neutron stars ) as the objects where these events takes place .",
    "moreover , in the three giant flares detected so far , theoretical studies  @xcite suggest that the quasi - periodic oscillations frequencies , measured during the afterglow of the flare activity  @xcite , are associated with crustal oscillations in the neutron star and/or oscillations in the magnetic field of the neutron star .",
    "furthermore , recent studies  @xcite have speculated that the flare activity could couple with the dynamical gravitational fields of the star to trigger the production of gravitational waves .",
    "in addition , the importance of electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational - wave signals has been also discussed in the context of recent numerical simulations of binary black hole systems  @xcite , of collapsing hypermassive neutron stars  @xcite , and of binary neutron star systems  @xcite .",
    "further studies are needed to investigate the conditions under which electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations couple to generate emission of radiation through both channels .",
    "we have taken a first step in recent work  @xcite ( paper i ) .",
    "we studied the coupling of axial gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations for both , black holes and neutron stars , neglecting the back reaction of the electromagnetic waves since the energy budget in the system is dominated by gravity .",
    "our study found that the emitted energy in electromagnetic waves driven by the gravitational waves is proportional to not only the emitted energy in gravitational waves but also to the square of the strength of the magnetic field of the central object .",
    "that is , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the magnetic field strength . for the case of a black hole background",
    "it was found that @xmath2 , while for neutron stars this factor depends on the compactness of the neutron star . for a compactness of @xmath3 we obtained @xmath4",
    "while for a compactness of @xmath5 the result was @xmath6 .",
    "additionally , it is suggested that there can be resonances between the two types of waves under certain conditions @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate electromagnetic emission driven by polar gravitational perturbations . unlike axial gravitational perturbations , the expectation is that polar perturbations are able to drive longer emission in both gravitational and electromagnetic waves . here",
    "again , we ignore back - reaction effects from the magnetic field on the spacetime geometry . following the previous study in paper i",
    ", we consider both the cases of black holes and neutron stars .",
    "we examine in particular the dependence of the gravitational - electromagnetic coupling for neutron stars on the stellar mass and the equation of state .",
    "then , we find that @xmath7 for a black hole background , a value roughly twice the one found in paper i for electromagnetic waves driven by the axial gravitational waves . on the other hand",
    ", we also find that @xmath8 , for a neutron star background , can be written as a function of @xmath9 as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 an @xmath12 denote the stellar mass and radius .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ( section  [ sec : background ] )",
    ", we briefly describe the equilibrium configurations that provide the gravitational background ( spacetime background geometry ) as well as the the perturbative equations . in section  [ sec : results ] , we show and discuss the numerical results for both the black hole and neutron star cases . we make conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusion ] . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt geometric units , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively , and use the metric signature @xmath16 .",
    "since the systems we are considering involve dynamical gravitational and electromagnetic fields and , for the case of neutron stars , fluids , the equations to be solved are the einstein - maxwell equations , coupled to the relativistic hydrodynamic equations for the neutron star case . in general , the presence of magnetic fields causes deformations in compact objects due mostly to non - radial magnetic pressure .",
    "however , for astrophysically relevant situations , the magnetic energy is much smaller than the gravitational binding energy of the compact object .",
    "for instance , in magnetars , with expected magnetic field strengths of the order of @xmath17 g , the ratio of the magnetic energy to the gravitational binding energy is @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , it is then safe to neglect the back - reaction of the magnetic fields on the background spacetime metric geometry .",
    "that is , the coupling between gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations is such that gravitational perturbations influence the dynamics of electromagnetic perturbations but not vice versa . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume non - rotating black holes and neutron stars ; thus , we use the schwarzschild metric for the exterior of the black hole and the neutron star , and the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) solution in the interior of neutron stars ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this solution can be written as @xmath19 where the metric functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 , in the interior of a neutron star , are determined by the tov equations . in the exterior , as in the case of a black hole , they are determined by the standard schwarzschild solution : @xmath22 .",
    "regarding the magnetic field , we consider only dipole configurations .",
    "detailed expressions of the dipole magnetic fields in the interior of the neutron star and the exterior of the black hole and neutron star can be found in paper i. in the same way , in this paper we continue using the ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) approximation to model the neutron star .",
    "given the background equilibrium configurations described above , we add small perturbations to both the gravitational and electromagnetic fields .",
    "the equations governing these small perturbations are obtained by linearizing the einstein - maxwell equations ( coupled to the fluid stress - energy tensor variables in the case of neutron stars ) .",
    "the energy stored in the gravitational perturbations can be significantly larger than that in the electromagnetic perturbations , since the gravitational binding energy of the equilibrium configurations is typically a few orders of magnitude larger than the energy of the magnetic field . following this argument",
    "we then neglect the back - reaction of the electromagnetic perturbations on the gravitational ones in this paper , in the same way as in paper i.    the detailed form of the coupled system of perturbation equations for both the electromagnetic and gravitational fields are described and presented in detail in paper i. there we have shown that the dipole  electric ( polar ) type \" electromagnetic perturbations are driven by axial quadrupole gravitational perturbations , while dipole  magnetic ( axial ) type \" electromagnetic perturbations are driven by polar quadrupole gravitational perturbations .",
    "the first case has already been studied in paper i while the details of the second case are presented in this paper .",
    "this second case is considerably more involved than the first one , especially for the case of neutron stars .",
    "moreover , the interaction between the two fields lasts longer due to the presence of the fluid which acts as an energy reservoir . as a result ,",
    "the energy emitted in the form of electromagnetic waves is considerably larger than in the case studied in paper i. the perturbation equations for the second case , i.e. for dipole magnetic - type ( axial ) electromagnetic perturbations driven by polar quadrupole gravitational perturbations , are summarized in appendix .",
    "in this section we present results of numerical computations of the generation of dipole `` magnetic '' ( axial ) type electromagnetic perturbations driven by `` electric '' ( polar ) quadrupole gravitational perturbations both for black holes and neutron stars .",
    "first , we consider the case of a black hole immersed in a dipole magnetic field . this case is simpler than the neutron star case because it involves finding solutions to only the gravitational and electromagnetic perturbation equations .",
    "as it was pointed out in paper i , there are issues with the background dipole magnetic field near the event horizon .",
    "the magnetic field diverges logarithmically as one approaches the event horizon , more specifically @xmath23 , with @xmath24 being the magnetic dipole moment that an observer at infinity sees  @xcite .",
    "it is important to remark that the presence of a magnetic field around the black hole is not incompatible with the fact that an isolated black hole can not sustain a magnetic field due to the no - hair theorem of general relativity .",
    "what we are attempting to model here is a black hole in an astrophysical environment , such as the case of a black hole with an accretion disk . in this sense",
    ", we envision the dipole magnetic field in the vicinity of the black hole as being anchored to the accretion disk  @xcite . in practice ,",
    "as we did in paper i , we adopt the condition that @xmath25 for @xmath26 , because @xmath27 const is the valid solution near the horizon , where we have only freedom in deciding where the transition between the internal constant and external dipole solutions occurs .",
    "we especially decide that @xmath28 as the transition position , which is motivated by the location , in the case of non - rotating black holes , of the innermost stable circular orbit for test massive particles at @xmath28 .",
    "we identify the magnetic dipole moment @xmath24 with the normalized magnetic field strength @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the field strength determined at @xmath28 and @xmath31 .",
    "we remark that although we have adopted @xmath28 for the transition position , this selection does not affect significantly the results in this paper provided the transition position is larger than @xmath32 .    in order to solve numerically the perturbative equations we use the same techniques as in paper i ( see  @xcite for more details ) , namely a crank - nicholson method  @xcite on a mesh with uniform grid - spacing in the radial tortoise coordinate ( defined as @xmath33 ) @xmath34 ( see  @xcite for the convergence tests of the results with respect to the grid spacing ) .",
    "the time step is chosen such that @xmath35 .",
    "we choose vanishing initial electromagnetic perturbations , i.e. , @xmath36 , but an ingoing gaussian wave packet for the gravitational perturbation @xmath37 .",
    "that is , @xmath38 $ ] and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "in the course of the evolutions , we compute the luminosity emitted in gravitational waves , @xmath42 , and in electromagnetic waves , @xmath43 , using the well - known expressions  @xcite @xmath44 where it is understood that we consider only the dominant modes , @xmath45 for the electromagnetic perturbations and @xmath46 for the gravitational perturbations .",
    "the total energy emitted in electromagnetic and gravitational waves is obtained by integrating in time these luminosities .    as it happened in the case of axial gravitational perturbations driving  electric - type \" electromagnetic waves , considered in paper i",
    ", we find that the electromagnetic - wave and gravitational - wave energies emitted , @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively , satisfy the following relationship @xmath49 with @xmath8 a proportionality constant depending on the magnetic field distribution .    in what follows",
    ", we present results of numerical simulations where the strength of magnetic field has been fixed to be @xmath50 g , i.e. @xmath51 . in figure",
    "[ fig : gw ] , we show the amplitude of the polar gravitational wave @xmath37 ( left panel ) and of the axial electromagnetic wave @xmath52 ( right panel ) as observed at @xmath53 , where the amplitude of the waves has been normalized so that the emitted energy in gravitational waves satisfies @xmath54 ergs , which is of the order of the typical energy radiated from physical phenomena associated with the compact objects . with this normalization ,",
    "the resulting energy emitted in electromagnetic waves is @xmath55 ergs . from these energies emitted in gravitational and electromagnetic waves , and using eq .",
    "( [ eq : e ] ) , we find that @xmath7 , a value roughly twice the one found in paper i for electromagnetic waves driven by the axial gravitational waves .",

    "this paper presents results of the emission of gravitational and electromagnetic waves from the strongly magnetized compact objects , extending the study presented in paper i  @xcite . in paper",
    "i we formulated the problem and examined in detail the case of  electric - type \" ( polar ) electromagnetic waves driven by `` magnetic - type '' ( axial ) gravitational perturbations . in the present work ,",
    "we focused on the case in which  magnetic - type \" ( axial ) electromagnetic waves are driven by `` electric - type '' ( polar ) gravitational waves . as we have pointed out before , for the case of neutron stars",
    ", this situation is observationally more interesting because such type of gravitational waves are associated with fluid oscillations , and thus they will tell us about properties of the structure of the star .    in the case of black holes , we find that the emission of  magnetic - type \" ( axial ) electromagnetic waves driven by `` electric - type '' ( polar ) gravitational perturbations is very similar to that of  electric - type \" ( polar ) electromagnetic waves driven by `` magnetic - type '' ( axial ) gravitational perturbations studied in paper i. more specifically , we obtained the same relationship as in paper i between the radiated energy in electromagnetic waves and the energy emitted in gravitational waves , namely @xmath63 . on the other hand , for neutron stars , we observe that the polar gravitational waves last longer than in the axial case , and thus also the radiation of  magnetic - type \" ( axial ) electromagnetic waves .",
    "this is due to the coupling with the fluid which acts as a storage reservoir of energy which slowly leaks energy to the electromagnetic sector during a longer time period .",
    "this process is revealed via the study of the spectra of the perturbations , where we can see that the oscillation frequencies of gravitational and electromagnetic waves are the same as those of the fluid perturbations .",
    "our results also show that the larger the compactness of the star , the stronger is the coupling between the two types of perturbations leading to an enhancement in the energy transfer and the emission of electromagnetic waves .    at the same time , the emitted radiation get damped out faster for large compactness models than for those with smaller values .",
    "unfortunately , at frequencies of a few khz , the emitted radiation in electromagnetic waves is easily absorbed by the interstellar medium and/or the plasma around the compact objects . to be detectable , one would have to explore reprocessing mechanisms .",
    "we are currently investigating situations / mechanism where this electromagnetic emission may be detectable and the type of information that we could extract from them .",
    "in this appendix , we present the perturbation equations for gravitational and electromagnetic waves adopted in this paper .",
    "more details can be found in paper i @xcite . using the well - known regge - wheeler gauge ,",
    "the metric perturbations , @xmath64 , with polar parity can be decomposed into tensor spherical harmonics as @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 are functions of @xmath70 and @xmath71 only , and @xmath72 denotes the scalar spherical harmonics on the @xmath73sphere . on the other hand , the tensor harmonic expansion for the  magnetic \" multipoles ( or axial parity ) of the electromagnetic perturbations , @xmath74 , is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 are also functions of @xmath70 and @xmath71 only .",
    "for the perturbations around the neutron star background , we adopt the formalism derived by allen _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , where the perturbations are described by three coupled wave - type equations , i.e. , two equations describe the perturbations of the spacetime and the other one describes the fluid perturbations .",
