    "the properties of super - star clusters set them apart .",
    "they are extremely compact and luminous clusters , with full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of less than 15 pc and m@xmath6 brighter than about @xmath710 ( see , for example , van den bergh 1971 ; arp & sandage 1985 ; melnick , moles , & terlevich 1985 ; holtzman et al .",
    "1992 ; whitmore et al .",
    "if they are bound and contain low mass stars , they resemble what we would expect a globular cluster to be like when it was young .",
    "r136 , for example , the star cluster in the 30 doradus h@xmath8ii  complex in the lmc , is the nearest example of a small super - star cluster .",
    "it has a half - light radius r@xmath9  of 1.7 pc , an m@xmath6 at an age of 2 myr of @xmath711 , and a mass of @xmath10 m_@xmath3  if the mass spectrum continues down to 0.1 m_@xmath3  stars ( hunter et al .",
    "therefore , the super - star clusters are an extreme mode of star formation .    in spite of the fact that the milky way has not been able to form a cluster as compact and luminous as a globular cluster for some 10 gyr ( although there may be one forming now ",
    "kndlseder 2000 ) , young and old super - star clusters have been found in tiny irregular galaxies .",
    "six super - star clusters are known in five nearby dwarf irregular galaxies and are inferred to be present , though still embedded , in 4 others .",
    "ngc 1569 , for example , with an integrated m@xmath6 of only @xmath11 , nevertheless , hosts two young super - star clusters with individual m@xmath6 of @xmath714 and @xmath713 ( arp & sandage 1985 ; oconnell , gallagher , & hunter 1994 ) .",
    "wlm , with a galactic m@xmath6 of only @xmath714 , contains a bonafide globular cluster that is 14.8 gyr old ( hodge et al .",
    "so , what are the conditions that allow small irregular galaxies to form super - star clusters when the milky way can not ? do super - star clusters require the same extraordinary circumstances to develop as globular clusters did , and what are those conditions ?",
    "populous clusters , less extreme cousins to the super - star clusters , have also been found in large numbers in the magellanic clouds ( see , for example , gascoigne & kron 1952 ; hodge 1960 , 1961 ; bica et al .",
    "these objects are less luminous and less massive than the super - star clusters but more extreme in luminosity and compactness than open clusters .",
    "a young populous cluster is exemplified by ngc 1818 in the lmc . at an age of about 20 myr",
    ", it has an m@xmath6 of @xmath79.3 , an r@xmath9  of 3.2 pc , and a mass of 3@xmath12 m_@xmath3  ( hunter et al .",
    "1997 ) . besides the magellanic clouds ,",
    "14 populous clusters have been identified in the irregular ngc 1569 ( hunter et al .",
    "2000 ) , but none have been found in galaxies like ic 1613 ( hodge 1978 ) and ngc 6822 ( hodge 1977 ) .",
    "( the star clusters identified in ic 1613 and ngc 6822 by hodge are open clusters although one in ngc 6822 has a globular - like metallicity [ cohen & blakeslee 1998 ] ) .",
    "so , what conditions are necessary for the formation of populous clusters ?    the high resolution of hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) _ is essential to surveying even nearby galaxies for compact clusters .",
    "since a fundamental characteristic of these clusters is their compactness , it is easy to mistake them for a single star with inadequate resolution .",
    "the closest super - star cluster , r136 in the lmc , has a half - light diameter of about 13 . at a distance of 0.7 mpc , the lower end of the range studied here",
    ", r136 would have a radius of 1 , which pushes the limit of typical ground - based telescopes .",
    "_ hst _ s factor of 10 higher resolution allows us to detect and measure clusters up to 10 times more distant .",
    "the problem with resolution is exemplified by the disagreements based on ground - based data over whether the core of r136 was a super massive 2000 m_@xmath3  star or a cluster of very massive stars ( cassinelli , mathis , & savage 1981 ) and whether the two super - star clusters in ngc 1569 were really star clusters or bright single stars in that galaxy ( arp & sandage 1985 ) . in both cases",
    "the objects are clusters of stars rather than single stars , but studies using ground - based data could not definitely determine this . due to these inadequacies , a survey for compact clusters beyond the magellanic clouds benefits greatly from _",
    "we have used images from the _ hst _ archives of dwarf irregular galaxies within 7 mpc to study cluster - producing environments .",
    "unfortunately , since we are using archival data , we did not have a choice in the pointing of the telescope , the filters used , or the exposure times , and the characteristics of what was available placed limits on our search .",
    "promising galaxies that were imaged for a teasing 0.5 s had to be passed over , as did those with only one filter .",
    "only nearby dwarfs galaxies that could be reasonably searched were included in the survey .",
    "the data used were taken with the _ hst _ and consist of wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) images of 22 dwarf irregular galaxies within a distance of 7 mpc . since the images came from a multitude of different programs , the number of pointings and filters varied from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "table [ galaxypars ] lists , in order of integrated magnitude , the galaxies studied along with the pointings and filters used for each . the footprints of each of these pointings can be seen superposed on broad - band ground - based images of each galaxy in figure [ figfoot ] .",
    "the filters are part of the _ hst _ flight system , and can be calibrated to the johnsons / cousin ubvri system using transformation formulas provided by holtzman et al .",
    "f336w corresponds to a u - band filter , f439w to b , f555w to the v - band , and f814w to an i - band filter .",
    "when available , we combined multiple exposures of the same field of view and same filter to remove cosmic rays , while preserving photometric integrity .",
    "exposure times of individual images varied from 140 s to 2800 s.    all of the pointings in each galaxy were searched for clusters using criteria of a minimum fwhm and magnitude .",
    "the minimum fwhm used was 2 pixels for the wf ccds , which have a pixel size of 0.099 , and 2.5 pixels for the pc ccd , which has a pixel size of 0.0456 .",
    "these limits were just larger than the point spread function ( psf ) , insuring that the object is resolved with respect to a single star .",
    "this does mean that in the more distant galaxies our lower bound was intrinsically much bigger than in near galaxies , and this trend can be seen in the resulting fwhm of the clusters found .",
    "we also imposed a magnitude minimum .",
    "this was chosen to be the v magnitude of a cluster of mass 10@xmath13 m_@xmath3and an age of 1 gyr .",
    "this corresponds to roughly an old populous cluster or the low end of the range of globular cluster masses .",
    "these criteria result in an m@xmath6 limit of @xmath14 . for all of our images ,",
    "this magnitude limit is much brighter than the photometric limit of the images and so all objects brighter than this limit would be found ( but see discussion of other complications below ) .",
    "the images were searched by doing radial profiles on all objects to well below our brightness cut - off to make sure that we were getting all objects that fit our criteria .",
    "the fwhm of the clusters were determined from the radial profile .",
    "we performed photometry on all the clusters that fit these criteria ( except for cases of blatant cosmic ray interference ) using an aperture that contained the visible region of the cluster , usually about twice the fwhm but occasionally more . to subtract the sky contribution from the cluster luminosity",
    ", we used the mode of sky brightness values in an annulus measured around the cluster .",
    "the results of the photometry were then calibrated to the wfpc2 system using the synthetic zero points of holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .    in order to deredden the photometry",
    ", we used stsdas simulations of blackbody spectra through the various filters to find the difference between expected and observed magnitude values , since the reddening correction is a function of the spectral energy distribution of the object .",
    "the extinction values used were an internal e(b@xmath7v ) of 0.05 for each galaxy plus individual values for foreground extinction due to dust within the milky way depending on the location of galaxy ( values taken from burstein & heiles 1984 ) .",
    "a single reddening was used for all clusters in a galaxy .    in the case where the filter f336w was used , we further corrected for the red leak in the filter by again using stsdas simulations .",
    "the correction was a function of an observed color such as f555w@xmath7f814w .",
    "the final step was to convert the flight magnitudes to the johnsons / cousins system as specified in the formulas of holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . in the case of some galaxies",
    "where the only available filters were f606w ( v@xmath15r ) and f814w ( i ) , we compared the observed f606w@xmath7f814w color to blackbody spectra as seen through f606w , f814w , r and i to get r@xmath7i from f606w@xmath7f814w .",
    "we used the conversions from holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) to get i and then solved for the r magnitude .",
    "our objects should be considered _ candidate _ compact clusters . among other problems , we may have imposters in the ranks .",
    "given the low dust density of dwarf irregular galaxies , it is often possible to see background galaxies in the images , and bright elliptical galaxies can be hard to distinguish from red clusters . at the outer edges of galaxies",
    "they can be identified but towards the center , the more likely location for clusters , the subtle distinction between the two poses a more serious risk . rather than discard potential candidates , we chose to include all and accept that some may be background galaxies .",
    "however , we did exclude resolved objects that were located in the outer parts or beyond the optical galaxy as most likely background galaxies .",
    "in addition we can not be certain that all objects are clusters  a collection of stars formed in a single star - forming event .",
    "some may be a chance superposition of several stars along the line of sight . because of our desire to include faint old populous clusters , our magnitude limit overlaps with the brightest stars found in galaxies .",
    "a few of these stars in close proximity could fall within our constraints .",
    "in addition to the possibility of imposters , we also have problems that would lead us to miss clusters .",
    "particularly , clusters that are saturated on the available ccd images and not already known to be a cluster would not make it onto our list .",
    "also , for half of the galaxies searched , there was only one exposure in each filter , leaving it vulnerable to the mercies of cosmic rays .",
    "cluster candidates that were found in one filter occasionally could not be measured in another due to intrusive cosmic ray interference .",
    "also , there were a few candidates annoyingly located at the boundaries of the chip , making it impossible to get a good sky value for that area and forcing us to discard the object .",
    "in addition , the _ hst _ images only covered a fraction of the optical galaxy in most cases .",
    "the fraction of the area covered within d@xmath16 , the diameter at which the galaxy drops to a b - band surface brightness of 25 mag arcsec@xmath5 , is listed in table [ galaxypars ] .",
    "of the 22 galaxies searched , we found candidate compact clusters in 8 of them .",
    "table [ tabcld ] shows the cluster demographics in these galaxies . in tables",
    "411 we present parameters of each cluster found .",
    "figure [ figfwhm ] shows a histogram of the measured fwhms for all of the clusters .",
    "most common is a fwhm of between 4 and 6 pc .",
    "thus , these are indeed compact clusters , and comparable to those seen in other galaxies .    in order to determine an age for each cluster , we compared the integrated cluster photometry to cluster evolutionary models of leitherer et al .",
    "their models chart the colors of a cluster with a mass of 10@xmath17 m_@xmath3over time , assuming a salpeter ( 1955 ) stellar initial mass function ( imf ) of 0.1 to 100 m_@xmath3 .",
    "the models are dependent on the metallicity @xmath18 of the host galaxy .",
    "we estimated @xmath18 from the more commonly available oxygen abundance found from nebular emission .",
    "most galaxies have metallicities near @xmath19 z_@xmath3 .",
    "studies of clusters in ngc 1569 and ngc 4449 have found that the ensemble of clusters were fit better with cluster evolutionary tracks of a somewhat higher metallicity than one would have predicted from the nebular oxygen abundance ( hunter et al .",
    "2000 ; gelatt , hunter , & gallagher 2001 ) .",
    "for this reason , we bracketed the data between models of two @xmath18 where possible to allow better comparison .",
    "however , we have chosen to use the higher metallicity model to estimate the age of the clusters .",
    "the clusters from each galaxy are shown on color - color or color - magnitude plots along with the models in figures [ fign4214 ] to [ figsexa ] .",
    "age estimates from comparison with cluster evolutionary models are uncertain in any event .",
    "this is especially true in small clusters where stochastic effects due to the small numbers of stars can wreak havoc .",
    "this problem is discussed and simulated by girardi & bica ( 1993 ; see also santos & frogel 1997 , brocato et al.1999 ) .",
    "their simulations show a scatter of several tenths in ubv colors .",
    "in addition to this problem , for many galaxies we have only one color to work with .",
    "the additional information of the second color is important in constraining an age . for clusters with only one color",
    "we have simply noted where the cluster color intersects the cluster evolutionary tracks ( @xmath200.05 mag ) . in the cases where clusters were too red or blue to fall near the evolutionary tracks , we assigned the age of the place on the tracks that is closest to the clusters ; these cluster ages are denoted by a colon to mark their uncertainty .",
    "some clusters fell too far from the tracks to assign an age at all . in cases where clusters had a large range of possible ages and were within a region of h@xmath21  emission , we assumed that it must be young and used the lower age as a value for that cluster .",
    "for a few clusters where the age predicted by the colors were in conflict with the presence of nebular emission , we assigned a young age consistent with the nebular emission . in these cases , as well as others , variable extinction across the galaxies may contribute to moving a cluster away from the cluster evolutionary tracks . in a u@xmath7v versus v@xmath7i color - color diagram",
    "a reddening line moves a cluster diagonally to the lower right ( see figure [ fign4214 ] ) .",
    "the clusters are of different ages , and since clusters fade with time , to compare absolute magnitudes , and hence relative mass , we must compare at a fiducial age .",
    "we have chosen a standard of 10 myr , and used the models to determine how much to correct the magnitude of each cluster . when the photometry of a cluster corresponded to a range of possible ages in the model , we calculated the range of magnitudes at 10 myr for those ages .",
    "for those clusters that fell unreasonably far from the evolutionary tracks , we have not estimated a magnitude at 10 myr and they are not counted in our census .",
    "the m@xmath6 at 10 myr of the collection of clusters are shown in figure [ figmag ] .",
    "the terms super - star cluster and populous cluster are not quantitatively defined .",
    "hodge ( 1961 ) first used the term populous cluster to refer to the compact clusters in the magellanic clouds .",
    "the use of super - star cluster arose later to emphasize their extreme nature ( van den bergh 1971 ) . here , we have chosen to define these cluster categories using the m@xmath6 of the cluster predicted for an age of 10 myr .",
    "we have chosen to define a super - star cluster as a cluster with a magnitude at 10 myr of at least @xmath710.5 .",
    "this is the absolute magnitude that r136 is predicted to have at that age .",
    "the criterion for a populous cluster is taken from larsen & richtler ( 2000 ) .",
    "they used a limit of m@xmath22 for red objects ( u@xmath7b@xmath23 ) and an m@xmath6 of @xmath79.5 for blue clusters ( u@xmath7b@xmath24 ) .",
    "since we are using m@xmath6 related to 10 myr , we use an m@xmath6 lower limit of @xmath79.5 for these clusters . for comparison ,",
    "we collect properties from the literature of known super - star clusters found in other dwarf irregular galaxies in table [ tabssc ] .",
    "we have determined the number of clusters n@xmath25 with m@xmath6 at 10 myr brighter than @xmath79.5 .",
    "this includes populous and super - star clusters .",
    "this number divided by the area of the galaxy surveyed ( within d@xmath16 ) is the number density nd@xmath25 .",
    "similarly , the number of super - star clusters is n@xmath26 and the number per unit area is nd@xmath26 .",
    "these values are given for each galaxy in table [ tabcld ] .",
    "we also include in this table several dwarf irregular galaxies studied by others : ic 10 ( hunter 2001 ) , ngc 4449 ( gelatt et al .",
    "2001 ) , ngc 1569 ( hunter et al.2000 ) , and viizw403 ( lynds et al .",
    "ic 10 and ngc 1569 are starburst galaxies ( massey & johnson 1998 ; gallagher , hunter , & tutukov 1984 ) , ngc 4449 has been disturbed by an interaction in the past 1 gyr ( hunter et al .",
    "1998 ) . of these , only ngc 4449 and ngc 1569 contain populous and super - star clusters .",
    "classification as a populous or super - star cluster depends critically on the estimate of age since this in turn determines the prediction of m@xmath6 at 10 myr .",
    "an old cluster has a large correction to m@xmath6 , and such an age estimate misapplied could turn a very modest cluster into a super - star cluster . our uncertainties over ages in many cases are reflected in the range in numbers given in table [ tabcld ] .",
    "the lower number includes only clusters with a single age estimate , as given in tables 411 .",
    "the larger number in the range includes clusters that would fall into our magnitude bin _ if _ the older age is the correct one . in most cases ,",
    "the uncertainty in age reflects the multi - valued nature of the models for a single color ; a second color would improve the age estimates . in the discussion and plots below , we conservatively use only the lower numbers in the ranges in table [ tabcld ] .",
    "this starburst galaxy was a jackpot .",
    "we have identified 29 cluster candidates . in figure [ fign4214 ]",
    "we can see that there are several clumps of clusters .",
    "one clump ( clusters 5 , 12 , 18 , 28 ) is far too blue in ( v@xmath7i)@xmath27 for the models",
    ". contamination of v by h@xmath21  emission is a possibility .",
    "we can see diffuse light around cluster 5 and cluster 18 is sitting in nebulosity . on the other hand",
    ", we can see nothing unusual with clusters 12 and 28 .",
    "we have assumed that these clusters are young , but because their colors are so unusual , we have not determined m@xmath6 at 10 myr and so can not compare them to other clusters .",
    "another clump of clusters falls just redward of the tail end of the cluster evolutionary track that ends at 1 gyr .",
    "we have assumed an age of 1 gyr for these clusters ( clusters 1 , 2 , 4 , 13 , 17 ; clusters 16 and 20 are assumed young because they sit in h@xmath21  emission regions ) .",
    "this region of the color - color diagram is also where one would expect milky way globular clusters to sit ( reed 1985 ) , so these clusters could be older than 1 gyr .",
    "however , this location would also be the place where we would expect to find background early - type galaxies ( poulain 1988 ) , so there is also a higher probability of contamination from non - galactic sources .",
    "finally , there is a clump of clusters that fall a little redward of the young leg of the evolutionary track in ( u@xmath7v)@xmath27 but blueward of the older leg in ( v@xmath7i)@xmath27 .",
    "we have assigned ages according to which branch the cluster falls closest , or in some cases our dual assignment reflects our uncertainty .",
    "leitherer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) had identified a possible embedded super - star cluster of 45 myr in the h@xmath8ii  complex at the center of the galaxy . however , we have identified another 6 which qualify as super - star clusters ( clusters 1 , 2 , 4 , 10 , 13 , 17 ) _ if _ their age estimates are correct .",
    "all are relatively old .",
    "if the older age is the correct one for clusters 3 , 21 , and 24 , they also would fall in the super - star cluster camp .",
    "clusters 15 , 16 , 26 , and 27 qualify as populous clusters , but only cluster 16 is young .",
    "if the older age of cluster 11 is appropriate , it would also qualify as a populous cluster .",
    "this fruitful harvest may be due to the properties of the host galaxy ; ngc 4214 is the brightest and largest galaxy surveyed and has a high star formation rate .",
    "maz - apellniz ( 2000 ) classes ngc 4214 as a starburst system .",
    "the clusters that we have found are only a lower limit to the numbers since the area surveyed by _ hst",
    "_ represents only about 20% of the area defined by its d@xmath16 diameter . on the other hand , the 20% of the area searched was in the center , near or in the large h@xmath8ii  complexes , so the area searched is the most likely to contain clusters .",
    "ngc 2366 is the second brightest galaxy surveyed , but sadly produced nowhere near the spectacular results of its rival , ngc 4214 . only about 38% of this galaxy",
    "was surveyed , although again the pointing was in a likely part of the galaxy .",
    "it does contain 3 clusters , but none merits the populous cluster classification .",
    "one cluster , labeled b after drissen et al .  ( 2000 ) , is located in the h@xmath8ii  complex numbered ii by drissen et al .  and given an age of 3 myr .",
    "ddo 50 is the next brightest galaxy , and also has 3 clusters .",
    "cluster 3 in table [ tabd50 ] is potentially a super - star cluster depending on its age , which is not well constrained , but if the young end of the range is appropriate , it would fall below even our populous cluster cut - off .",
    "the other two clusters did not fit the model well enough to estimate their magnitude at 10 myr .",
    "the cluster census is less certain here , since only 20% of the d@xmath16 area of ddo 50 was surveyed by _",
    "hst _ and the area surveyed was towards the edge of the d@xmath16 perimeter .",
    "in addition , the proximity of the clusters to the edge of galaxy increases the risk that they could be background galaxies instead .",
    "this galaxy , also a starburst , contains a known super - star cluster , previously studied by melnick , moles & terlevich ( 1985 ) and oconnell , gallagher & hunter ( 1994 ) .",
    "this cluster , labeled `` a , '' is included in table [ tabn1705 ] .",
    "we used data from oconnell et al .",
    "( from wfpc1 ) since the cluster saturated all frames used in this survey .",
    "fifteen other cluster candidates were found in this galaxy . in figure [ fign1705 ]",
    "we see that most of the clusters fall into two clumps",
    ". one clump ( clusters 1012 and 14 ) falls around 7 myr on the cluster evolutionary track .",
    "the other clump falls redward of the 1 gyr end of the track .",
    "these clusters we have tentatively assigned an age of 1 gyr although contamination by background galaxies is possible for these colors .",
    "clusters 1 and 15 do not appear in figure [ fign1705 ] because they fall beyond the red corner of the plot , far from the evolutionary track .",
    "the majority of the clusters were found surrounding the super - star cluster . while in other galaxies",
    "the clusters are relatively separated , here 10 of the clusters were found encircling the super - star cluster .",
    "these clusters are identified in figure [ fign1705around ] .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "footprint is helpfully positioned with the pc chip centered on the super - star cluster ; since the pc chip has the highest resolution , this proved useful in detecting the multitude of clusters around the center one .",
    "eight of these clusters ( clusters 714 ) are arranged in a semi - circle within 13@xmath28325 pc of the super - star cluster .",
    "two others ( clusters 4 and 5 ) are somewhat more detached but still within the same hemisphere .",
    "these two clusters plus two of the others were assigned an age of 1 gyr because they are very red .",
    "the others have ages of 7 or 15 myr .",
    "the age of the super - star cluster itself is 720 myr .",
    "if the age of 1 gyr for the red clusters is correct , their m@xmath6 corrected to 10 myr would place three of them in the category of populous clusters ( clusters 4 , 5 , and 9 ) and one would be a super - star cluster ( cluster 7 ) .",
    "none of the young clusters , which presumably formed at the same time as super - star cluster a , are bright enough to fall into the populous cluster category .    of the rest of the clusters in the galaxy , only three red clusters that we have dated at 1 gyr are comparable to populous ( cluster 2 ) or super - star clusters ( clusters 3 and 6 ) .",
    "the fact that only old clusters , with a large correction for fading with time , have m@xmath6 at 10 myr bright enough to be classed as populous or super - star clusters does make us suspicious that they are background galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , it seems an impressive number of clusters to find in a galaxy that is so much smaller than ngc 4214 , the only other galaxy to have clusters in comparable abundance .",
    "the cluster density is the highest in our survey sample , exceeded only by ngc 1569 ( hunter et al .",
    "however , this density is exaggerated due to the dense packing around the super - star cluster , and probably does not apply to the entire galaxy .",
    "as seen in table [ tabd168 ] , ddo 168 has 3 clusters in the area surveyed , 46% of the area defined by d@xmath16 . only about half of the _ hst _ footprint was within the galaxy , and those parts of the ccds that were exterior contained quite a few identifiable background galaxies .",
    "if we assume that these background galaxies , our own species of cosmic vermin , exist in the same density through the galaxy as around it , the risk that the clusters found are actually galaxies in disguise is a little higher and the reality of the clusters a little more doubtful .",
    "one of the clusters , cluster 1 , if the older age is appropriate would be classed as a populous cluster .      in the survey of this galaxy , again , there is a substantial sample of background galaxies , making the 4 clusters found slightly doubtful ( table [ tabd165 ] ) .",
    "we surveyed 60% of the d@xmath16 area and excluded the parts of the ccds outside the optical galaxy .",
    "the ages of these clusters are uncertain because we only had one color and several ages would be consistent with the colors .",
    "if the older age is correct , two of the clusters would be super - star clusters and one , a populous cluster .",
    "wlm has the advantage of already having a known globular cluster , studied by hodge et al .",
    "it was noticed next to wlm by humason , mayall , & sandage ( 1956 ) and later found to be associated through a common radial velocity . determined by hodge et al .  to be very similar to our own galactic halo globulars ,",
    "this is cluster 1 in table [ tabwlm ] .",
    "it is measured here to have an m@xmath6 of @xmath78.9 , close to the value of @xmath78.8 quoted by hodge et al.using data from sandage & carlson ( 1985 ) .",
    "this globular cluster is unusual in so faint a galaxy , the only one to exist in a dwarf irregular galaxy with a m@xmath6 fainter than @xmath29 in the local group , according to hodge et al .",

    "wlm currently fits the trend , having @xmath38(u ) near zero , but when it was younger the globular cluster would have been much brighter , possibly dominating the u - band emission from the whole galaxy unless the sfr over the entire galaxy was extraordinarily high at the same time .",

    "there are also 4 dwarf galaxies , listed in table [ tabssc ] with a `` ?",
    "'' mark , that are believed to contain an _ embedded _ super - star cluster .",
    "the properties of these clusters , including their compactness , are inferred from reradiation from the surrounding nebula rather than from direct optical observations of the clusters , so their classification as super - star cluster , rather than a very large ob association , is less certain than if the cluster were visible .",

    "most of the super - star clusters are young , with the exception of the globular cluster in wlm .",

    "table [ tabssc ] lists any crucial status of the galaxy that hosts a super - star cluster .",
    "most of the galaxies show some sign of being affected by an interaction with another galaxy , either currently or in the past .",
    "furthermore , most of the super - star clusters are located near the centers of the galaxies ( see also meurer et al .",
    "a few that are not located near the centers are located at the end of a stellar bar .",
    "the centers of interacting galaxies are special places since interactions can drive gas into this region ( noguchi 1988 ) .",
    "similarly , streaming motions around bars can pile the gas up there ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1980 ) .",
    "this correlation between the presence of super - star clusters and large - scale galactic disturbances suggests that dwarf irregulars need a special mechanism , like an external perturbation , internal stellar bar , or shell - shell interaction ( chernin , efremov , & voinovich 1995 ; fukui 1999 ) , to concentrate the gas enough to form a massive compact cluster .",
    "the exception to all of this is wlm . with an integrated m@xmath30 of only @xmath34",
    ", it nevertheless contains a globular cluster .",
    "when the globular cluster was 10 myr old , it would have had an m@xmath6 of order @xmath34 , rivaling the brightness of the entire galaxy as seen today .",
    "furthermore , wlm does not show any particular sign of having been disrupted by an interaction 15 gyr ago or of having gone through an extraordinary starburst then , although our ability to probe the star formation histories that far back is limited .",
    "the existence of this globular cluster in such a small galaxy and its rarity does suggest that something extraordinary happened to wlm nearly 15 gyr ago when the galaxy was first forming .",
    "other dwarf irregular galaxies are undergoing starbursts that do not show evidence of compact star formation and super - star clusters .",
    "ic 10 , for example , is a starburst galaxy ( massey & johnson 1998 ) that has not produced anything but small clusters and ob associations at least in the portion imaged with _ hst _ ( hunter 2001 ) .",
    "viizw403 and izw18 are bcds that have only made large ob associations ( hunter & thronson 1995 , lynds et al .",
    "neither the conditions that produce a starburst nor the starburst itself are sufficient to produce clusters of such an extreme nature .",
    "we do find a rather gregarious nature to super - star clusters .",
    "the super - star cluster in ngc 1705 has a collection of 10 smaller compact clusters arranged in a semi - circle around it .",
    "six of these have an age that is similar to that of the super - star cluster .",
    "there are also 10 compact clusters surrounding the youngest of the two super - star clusters in ngc 1569 ( hunter et al .",
    "2000 ) . again , at least 5 of these have an age comparable to that of the super - star cluster and another 3 have ages only @xmath4510 myr older .",
    "there are also ob associations formed over the past 10 myr arrayed around the super - star cluster r136 in the lmc that is itself 2 myr old .",
    "it appears that these super - star clusters have formed from very large gas complexes that produced compact clusters and ob associations as associated debris .",
    "star formation in such complexes appears to extend over a time - scale of roughly 10 myr . however , not all such complexes form super - star clusters ( kennicutt & chu 1988 ) .",
    "constellation iii in the lmc , for example , is an older complex that formed stars over a scale comparable to the 30 doradus nebula in which r136 sits .",
    "however , only a few populous clusters have formed in constellation iii ( dolphin & hunter 1998 ) .",
    "the gregarious nature of super - star clusters is consistent with the previous observation that stars form primarily in large regions where the gas column density exceeds a threshold value for strong gravity and a cool phase of hi ( skillman 1987 ; van zee et al .",
    "1997 ; hunter , elmegreen , & baker 1998 ) . in dwarf",
    "irregular galaxies , these pockets of high pressure are very localized because most of the interstellar medium is at low pressure ( elmegreen & hunter 2000 ) . as a result ,",
    "dense clusters form with other clusters and ob associations in islands of high pressure and high column density , with little activity between .",
    "spiral galaxies are different because they have a pressure that exceeds the threshold throughout the main disk , so star formation is distributed as well .",
    "the similarities and differences between the formation of dense massive clusters in dwarf and spiral galaxies gives us some insight into the correlation between @xmath39 and sfr@xmath16 .",
    "there is generally a relation between star formation rate per unit area , @xmath46 , and gas column density , @xmath47 , that spans a wide range of conditions , i.e. , @xmath48 ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "there is also an expectation that column density correlates with pressure too , from the self - gravity of the gas layer , giving @xmath49 .",
    "thus @xmath50 .",
    "the formation of a dense cluster also depends on pressure .",
    "all self - gravitating objects have a pressure that scales with the square of the mass column density , so both dense clusters and molecular cloud cores will have high pressures . in the case of a cluster ,",
    "this pressure is kinematic , from the motions of stars , but it reflects the high gas pressure in the cloud core where it formed .",
    "two equations may be used to relate cluster mass to pressure , given the characteristically high density that is used to define a cluster .",
    "these are the virial theorem , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the velocity dispersion and @xmath53 is the radius of the cluster , and the density - mass - radius relation , which may be converted into a pressure - mass - radius relation for average internal pressure @xmath54 .",
    "these two equations give a relation between mass , pressure and density : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the gas volume density .",
    "the normalization for this relation comes from the properties of the molecular core near the trapezium cluster in orion ( lada , evans & falgarone 1997 ) .",
    "the cluster mass derived in this way is a maximum for two reasons : smaller clusters can fragment out , and the cluster mass function may not sample out to this high value if there are not many clusters overall .",
    "also , larger clusters can form by coalescence , but their pressures will not reflect the initial cloud core conditions . from this relation",
    "we get @xmath57 for a given stellar density in a cloud core .",
    "virialized regions with lower average densities can form higher - mass star - forming regions for a given pressure , but these regions will be called ob associations and not clusters because of their lower densities . if the internal pressure @xmath58 scales with the ambient pressure , @xmath59 , then the maximum cluster mass @xmath60 .",
    "now we sum all the clusters to find the the total cluster mass , which is proportional to the total cluster l(u ) .",
    "if @xmath61 is the cluster mass function ( e.g. , zhang & fall 1999 ) , then the integral over @xmath62 from @xmath63 to infinity gives the normalization factor @xmath64 , i.e. @xmath65 , or @xmath66 . with this normalization ,",
    "the total cluster mass is @xmath67 , which depends only weakly on the minimum cluster mass , @xmath68 .",
    "similarly , the total number of clusters , @xmath69 , equals approximately @xmath70 , as may be determined from @xmath71 . for fixed @xmath68 defined by the survey , i.e. by the definition of a certain type of star cluster , such as galactic , populous , super , etc . , @xmath63 scales directly with the total number of clusters , @xmath72 , as found observationally by whitmore ( 2000 ) .",
    "the total mass in clusters scales mostly with @xmath63 because the logarithmic term is slowly varying .",
    "thus @xmath73 .",
    "the top left part of figure [ fig : masslum ] shows the total u - band luminosity of clusters brighter than m@xmath37 versus the star formation rate per unit area , plotting normal or starburst galaxies in larsen & richtler ( 2000 ) as dots , the starburst dwarfs ngc 1569 and ngc 1705 as triangles , and the four largest galaxies in their study ( ngc 7252 , ngc 3921 , ngc 3256 , and ngc 1275 ) as squares .",
    "the total cluster luminosity is derived from their value of @xmath39 and the u - band magnitude of the galaxy .",
    "the data for ngc 1569 and ngc 1705 are taken from our tables here .",
    "other galaxies from our tables are plotted as a circle ( ngc 4214 ) , a plus ( ngc 4449 ) , and a cross ( wlm ) to be consistent with the symbols in figure [ figsfr ] .",
    "the dashed line is a bi - variate least squares fit to the dots and squares only , i.e. , to the normal and large galaxies in larsen & richtler s study .",
    "the slope is @xmath74 , close to the theoretical value of 2 given above .",
    "the dwarfs ( circle , cross , plus and triangles ) have a similar trend but are displaced downward in this plot because there are fewer clusters and a smaller total cluster luminosity .",
    "the bottom left part of figure [ fig : masslum ] shows the total galaxy luminosity in u - band versus the star formation rate .",
    "the dashed line is a fit to the dots and squares and has a slope of @xmath75 .",
    "this plot has an increasing trend because the galaxies in larsen & richtler s ( 2000 ) study all have about the same size ( see below ) .",
    "thus the total u - band luminosity , which is related to the star formation rate per unit area times the area , ends up nearly proportional to the star formation rate per unit area .",
    "the right hand side of figure [ fig : masslum ] shows the same quantities normalized to the galaxy areas .",
    "the dashed lines are fits : the slope is 1.4 on the top and 0.5 on the bottom .",
    "the correlations are much better for the normalized data than for the un - normalized data .",
    "dwarf galaxies that plotted below the mean relations on the left in this diagram are brought in to a tight correlation on the right .",
    "the low value of the slope for galaxy @xmath76 versus @xmath77 is odd : it indicates that the average u - band intensity of a galaxy does not scale with the star formation rate per unit area ( if it did , the slope would be 1 ) .",
    "there could be several reasons for this .",
    "the u - band suffers more extinction than h@xmath21 , which was used for @xmath77 , and this extinction increases systematically with column density and therefore with @xmath77 , making the @xmath78 that escapes the galaxy increase slower with the star formation rate than the intrinsic @xmath78 ( hopkins et al .",
    "another possibility is that galaxies with high star formation rates form stars for a longer time relative to the average age of the hii region than galaxies with low star formation rates .",
    "this seems counter - intuitive since high rates should exhaust the gas supply faster than low rates , given the @xmath79 relation for gas column density @xmath47 ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the duration affects the ratio between u - band light , which comes from stars younger than @xmath80 myr ( many of which are in the field  hoopes , walterbos , & bothun 2001 ) and h@xmath21 , which comes from stars younger than @xmath81 my inside hii regions .",
    "a third explanation is that the average surface brightness of galaxies is about constant in b - band ( freeman 1970 ) , nearly independent of the star formation rate , so the average surface brightness in u - band is somewhat constant too , varying mostly because of a change in color with sfr@xmath16 .",
    "this goes in the right direction for the correlation in figure [ fig : masslum ] , but the actual color variations are not large enough to explain the total effect .",
    "perhaps some combination of these effects and others are responsible .",
    "whatever the reason , the change in slope going from un - normalized to normalized @xmath78 also occurs for the total cluster @xmath78 , so the ratio of these two quantities , which gives the parameter @xmath38 , preserves its near - linear correlation with @xmath77 regardless of normalization .",
    "the sizes of all the galaxies considered in this paper are shown in figure [ fig : sizes ] .",
    "the symbol types are the same as in the previous diagrams . the smallest galaxies in the larsen & richtler ( 2000 ) survey , ngc 1569 and ngc 1705 ( triangles ) , are about the same size as the dwarfs studied here ( circles , plus , and x symbols ) .",
    "the dots have a narrow range of sizes , and the squares are bigger , as defined .",
    "this separation between triangles , dots , and squares in the larsen & richtler data explains the similar separation in the lower left part of figure [ figsfr ] .",
    "there is a slight correlation between the star formation rate per unit area and the galaxy size in the larsen & richtler sample , but not among the dots alone and the squares alone in this figure .",
    "the overall correlation gives approximately a galaxy area @xmath82 sfr@xmath83 , which explains the decreases in slope of the total cluster @xmath78 and the galaxy @xmath78 versus @xmath77 in going from un - normalized to normalized quantities in figure [ fig : masslum ] .",
    "the ratio of the quantities plotted at the top and bottom of figure [ fig : masslum ] , multiplied by 100 , is the parameter @xmath39 .",
    "the linear increase in @xmath39 with sfr@xmath16 found by larsen & richtler ( 2000 ) is the result of a squared dependence of the numerator on sfr@xmath16 , as determined in part by _ local _ properties of cluster formation in environments with varying surface densities , pressures , and maximum cluster masses ( discussed above where @xmath84 ) , and a linear dependence of the denominator on sfr@xmath16 , as determined by the narrow range of galaxy sizes in the sample .    in a dwarf irregular galaxy ,",
    "the pressure may be large enough to make a massive dense cluster in a localized region of intense star formation , but because that region is small , the total sample of all clusters in the galaxy may be too small to produce one of the uncommon clusters at the high mass end of the mass spectrum . in this case , the star formation rate per unit area can be high over a small region , but the galaxy can be without a super - star cluster .",
    "most of the dwarfs studied here are in this category .",
    "they account for the circles in lower right part of figure [ figsfr ] .    in a large galaxy with a high star formation rate per unit area ,",
    "the maximum cluster mass is large and the number of clusters is also large enough to sample out to around this maximum mass .",
    "then the parameter @xmath39 represents the fraction of stars that is still in bound clusters after the evolution time for uv light .",
    "this fraction should depend on only the local conditions for star formation and consequently defines a _ maximum value for @xmath39 in galaxies of any size_. these local conditions suggest that most stars reside in dense clusters for the first @xmath85 years ( carpenter 2000 ) , and then disperse when their clusters emerge from the cloud cores ( lada , margulis , & dearborn 1984 ) . at an age of @xmath81 myr ,",
    "the mass fraction of stars that are still in bound clusters is only @xmath81% .",
    "this is the fraction of young stars in the form of bound clusters in the solar neighborhood ( elmegreen & clemens 1985 )",
    ". this fraction slowly decreases with time for a given population as the clusters continue to evaporate and disperse . in the @xmath80 myr time during which most of the uv light from star formation comes out ,",
    "only the smallest clusters evaporate .",
    "the super - star clusters studied here and by larsen & richtler ( 2000 ) , which are more massive than @xmath86 m@xmath87 , have long evaporation times and are hardly effected by disruption in the first 100 myr after they leave their cloud cores ( this situation changes in the nuclear regions , where even massive clusters disperse rapidly ",
    "kim et al . 2000 ) .",
    "thus the fraction of star formation in the form of super - star clusters is @xmath81% for surveys of high - p galaxies involving uv light  as long as the galaxy has a large enough mass to sample the cluster mass spectrum out to the high value of @xmath88 given by the pressure .",
    "this is what is seen in the bottom right panel of figure [ figsfr ] where t@xmath43(u)@xmath81 .",
    "the cluster fraction should be lower than 10% among low - mass clusters , i.e. , in the mass range from @xmath89 to @xmath90 m@xmath87 , even for high - p galaxies , because these clusters evaporate more quickly than high - mass clusters in the u - band evolution time .",
    "the cluster fraction should be lower in redder passbands too because the longer evolution time gives more clusters an opportunity to disrupt .",
    "the fraction of stars in massive bound clusters is also lower in lower pressure galaxies , which means galaxies with lower normalized star formation rates , because then @xmath63 is small as a result of the small total number of clusters and the small pressure .",
    "this decreasing fraction is what is shown by the larsen - richtler relation in figure [ figsfr ] ( lower right panel ) among galaxies that have about the same area , to within a factor of @xmath91 .",
    "when the area is much smaller , as in the dwarf irregulars , it becomes physically difficult to form a massive cluster if @xmath59 is low , and it becomes unlikely to form one even if @xmath59 is high .",
    "occasionally a dwarf will do this if the random fluctuations that make dense clouds happen to produce a rare massive one .",

    "it is affected by whatever makes the mass spectrum of clouds and clusters , which is presumably related to turbulence ( elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) , and it does not depend much on the details of the star formation process . however , there is a second property of the maximum cluster mass : it scales with the square of the normalized star formation rate , forcing the total cluster luminosity to scale with sfr@xmath99 too ( fig . [ fig : masslum ] ) .",
    "thus , there is a local influence in the star formation process , like the pressure discussed in section [ sect : origin ] .",
    "the difference between the global and local aspects of cluster formation are not evident from the spiral galaxy cluster sample because most of these galaxies have the same size .",
    "the differences between the global and local affects show up better after comparing the spirals and dwarf irregulars .",
    "this brings us to the third property of clusters evident from figure [ fig : sos ] . for small galaxies with large sfr@xmath16",
    ", the size - of - sample effect should not give a superstar cluster because the total sample of clusters is small .",
    "indeed , most of the dwarf galaxies surveyed here do not have one , even if their normalized star formation rates are as high as for the spiral galaxies in larsen & richtler s sample ( see the circles in the bottom right panel of fig . [ figsfr ] ) .",
    "however , when the sfr@xmath16 is high , there _ are _ high pressure regions that _ can _ form massive clusters sometimes .",
    "this occurs when the stochastic process of cloud formation in a turbulent fluid happens to make a massive dense cloud .",
    "when such a cloud forms stars , the resulting cluster will be more massive than expected from the extrapolation of the cluster mass function elsewhere in the galaxy .",
    "then the galaxy will be plotted in the lower right parts of the bottom three panels in figure [ fig : sos ] .",
    "the correlation between massive cluster formation in dwarf irregular galaxies and galaxy - wide disturbances suggests that turbulence may have been elevated before star formation began .",
    "interactions agitate a galaxy , increasing the velocity dispersion and leading to large scale flows ( kumai , basu , & fujimoto 1993 ; elmegreen , kaufman , & thomasson 1993 ) .",
    "these flows compress the gas , systematically at first and then randomly as the turbulence cascades , and they ultimately make the clouds in which clusters form .",
    "other cluster formation mechanisms are probably at work too .",
    "we already mentioned end - of - bar flows and shell collisions as mechanisms for creating anomalously high pressures .",
    "the 30 doradus region in the lmc could have been made by either . in any case",
    ", the final condensation of gas into a massive dense core requires the strong and persistent action of self - gravity . _",
    "the lack of shear is perhaps the biggest factor differentiating dwarfs from spirals_. gravitational instabilities in both the ambient medium and globally perturbed regions generally form giant clouds on the scale of the local jeans length , which can be hundreds of parsecs to several kiloparsecs in size , depending primarily on the ambient density . when there is little shear , these clouds retain their shape and condense over time as the turbulent energy dissipates and the angular momentum moves outward along magnetic field lines . the result can be a cloud core that is both massive enough and dense enough beneath the weight of the overlying material to form a super - star cluster .",
    "gravitational instabilities are very different in large galaxies , which always have shear in their main disks and may also have stellar spiral waves .",
    "if there are no stellar spirals , then gaseous instabilities form clouds as in dwarf galaxies , but these clouds quickly shear into flocculent spiral arms .",
    "the reason for this is that the shear time is comparable to the instability time when the gas surface density is close to the critical value and the rotation curve is approximately flat . smaller instabilities and smaller clouds form inside the shearing arms by parallel flows ( elmegreen 1991 ; kim & ostriker 2002 ) .",
    "as a result , the initial jeans - mass cloud fails to collapse into a single dense object . in galaxies with stellar spirals , ambient gravitational instabilities form clouds primarily in the arms where the density is high ; the shear is low there , so these clouds can take a globular shape forming the familiar beads - on - a - string pattern .",
    "however , spiral arm clouds reside in this low - shear environment for too short a time to be able to condense monotonically into massive dense cores ( elmegreen 1994 ; kim & ostriker 2002 ) .",
    "they only have time to build up modest pressures , and as a result , make small clusters and unbound associations with a wide range of masses .",
    "a similar argument about shear applies to the formation of giant shells around ob associations : dwarf galaxies can have shells ( as in the lmc , kim et al . 1999 ; ho ii , puche et al .",
    "1992 ; ic 2574 stewart & walter 2000 ) that are much larger compared to their galaxy sizes than the shells in spiral galaxies .",
    "this is because the pressure from star formation or cloud impacts in a low - shear galaxy can drive expansion for a long time without any distortion of the overall shape .",
    "coriolis forces are still present , but without shear , they only twist the whole structure around in a self - similar fashion as it expands outward .",
    "this well - known difference in shell morphology between dwarf galaxies and spiral galaxies is analogous to the proposed difference in cloud morphology .",
    "super - star clusters also form in the nuclear regions of some galaxies where the shear is low again .",
    "nearby examples of embedded nuclear clusters with thousands of o - type stars are in ngc 253 ( watson et al . 1996 ; keto et al . 1999 ) and ngc 5253 ( turner , beck & ho 2000 ) .",
    "an important difference is that the ambient pressure and density can be very high in galactic nuclei , so the clusters that form by gravitational instabilities can be even more massive than those in dwarf irregulars .",
    "after examining _ hst _ images of 22 nearby dwarf irregular galaxies , we have found compact star clusters in 8 of them . among these 8 we found 3 galaxies ( ngc 4214 , ngc 1705 , wlm ) that host populous clusters , which we define as clusters with m@xmath6 at a fiducial age of 10 myr brighter than @xmath79.5 .",
    "these same three galaxies host super - star clusters , which we define as clusters with m@xmath6 at an age of 10 myr brighter than @xmath100 .",
    "another 4 galaxies in our survey might contain populous clusters and another 3 could join the list as containing super - star clusters _ if _ the older age estimate in a range of ages consistent with the cluster s color is correct .",
    "however , this seems unlikely .",
    "we supplement our survey with our previous census of compact clusters in ic 10 , ngc 1569 , ngc 4449 , and viizw403 .",
    "ic 10 , ngc 1569 , and ngc 4449 contain compact clusters candidates , but only ngc 1569 and ngc 4449 contain populous clusters , and both also contain super - star clusters .",
    "> from these host galaxies , if we exclude wlm , we find a magnitude cutoff of m@xmath2 for the formation of populous and super - star clusters ; fainter than this and a galaxy does not seem to form these extreme star clusters with a high enough probability to have detected any in our sample .",
    "this is consistent with hodge et al.s ( 1999 ) claim that no dwarf irregular galaxy , except wlm , in the local group with m@xmath6 fainter than @xmath29 contains a globular cluster .",
    "there is also a minimum normalized star formation rate of 0.003 m_@xmath3  yr@xmath4 kpc@xmath5 for cluster formation .",
    "these limits , however , are not sufficient to mandate the development of clusters ; there exist bright enough galaxies with high star formation rates that are barren .",
    "the dwarf irregulars also contribute to the trends seen for spiral galaxies by larsen & richtler ( 2000 ) : the contribution of populous clusters to the u - band light of a galaxy increases as the integrated galactic m@xmath30 and normalized star formation rate increases .",
    "however , a few of the dwarf irregulars also contribute to the scatter and , again , there are examples of galaxies with high m@xmath30 or star formation rate and zero contribution from populous clusters .",
    "we can explain these results in terms of a general framework for understanding the larsen & richtler ( 2000 ) @xmath39 correlations , combined with the small sizes of dwarf galaxies and the observation that most dwarfs with super - star clusters look agitated .",
    "the correlations follow partly from the inter - dependencies of pressure , gas column density , and star formation rate in galaxies that are all about the same size and also large enough to sample the cluster mass spectrum out to the maximum cluster mass that is likely to form .",
    "small galaxies can not generally sample out this far , and will usually fall short of producing a massive compact cluster .",
    "small galaxies with global perturbations can make massive bound clusters , however .",
    "they may do this by the same star formation processes that operate in spiral galaxies , in which case the dwarfs with super star clusters are stochastic fluctuations in the dwarf sample . or , the dwarf may produce super star clusters by a mechanism that is unique to their type , such as a gravitational instability that is rendered more effective by the low rate of shear .",
    "similar processes may occur in the nuclear regions of large galaxies .",

    "<S> nearby dwarf irregular galaxies were searched for compact star clusters using data from the _ hst _ archives . </S>",
    "<S> eight of the 22 galaxies in our sample were found to host compact clusters of some type . </S>",
    "<S> three of these have populous clusters , with m@xmath0 at a fiducial age of 10 myr , and the same three also have super - star clusters , with m@xmath1 at 10 myr . </S>",
    "<S> four other dwarf galaxies , two of which contain populous and super - star clusters , are also considered using data in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest that galaxies fainter than m@xmath2 or with star formation rates less than 0.003 m_@xmath3  yr@xmath4 kpc@xmath5 do not form populous or super - star clusters , and that even the brighter and more active dwarfs rarely form them . yet </S>",
    "<S> when they do form , the associated star formation activity is very high , with numerous compact clusters of similar age in the same complex and evidence for a galaxy - wide perturbation as the trigger . </S>",
    "<S> this tendency to concentrate star formation in localized regions of high column density is consistent with previous suggestions that self - gravity must be strong and the pressure must be high to allow a cool phase of gas to exist in equilibrium .    </S>",
    "<S> statistical considerations emphasize the peculiarity of super star clusters in dwarf galaxies , which are too small to sample the cluster mass function to that extreme . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that triggered large - scale flows and ambient gravitational instabilities in the absence of shear make the clouds that form super - star clusters in small galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this is unlike the case in spiral galaxies where density wave flows and scale - free compression from turbulence seem to dominate . </S>",
    "<S> further comparisons with spiral galaxies give insight into larsen & richtler s relation between the star formation rate per unit area and the fraction of young stars in massive dense clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this relation is the result of a physical connection between maximum cluster mass , interstellar pressure , interstellar column density , and star formation rate , combined with a size - of - sample effect . </S>"
