    "semiflexible polymers such as actin or microtubules play essential roles for the elastic behavior of cellular structures @xcite .",
    "their mechanical properties are determined by their relatively high bending stiffness , characterized through a compared to the contour length @xmath1 large persistence length @xmath2 .",
    "many of the static and dynamic properties of single filaments have been investigated in the last decades , and many of the results carry over to more complex structures such as polymer networks @xcite and solutions @xcite , the latter of which are theoretically described through single filaments confined to an effective tube . in recent years , much experimental research",
    "is also focused on single molecule studies , by means of powerful new nano - technological methods , where filaments are routinely confined to micro- or nanometer - sized channels @xcite .",
    "theoretical understanding of confined semiflexible polymers has mainly been gained in terms of equilibrium statistics @xcite and some dynamical properties in microcapillary flows @xcite and on the linear response level @xcite . however , for larger forces such as those commonly applied in single - molecule experiments , it is important to account for the extremely high stretching stiffness of most semiflexible polymers , which as an effective inextensibility has not only significant consequences for the static force - extension relation but also heavily influences dynamical properties .",
    "the responsible nonlinearities are especially apparent when externally applied forces are suddenly changed , for in this case the backbone tension , which prevents stretching of monomer bonds , shows a highly nontrivial spatial and temporal dependence .",
    "previous approaches to capture this phenomenon were based on heuristic scaling arguments and effective theories @xcite .",
    "these early results were later confirmed and generalized by means of a systematic formalism based on a multiple scale perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "recent extensions of these results include prestressed filaments @xcite , transverse forces @xcite , extensible backbones @xcite , and oscillatory forces @xcite .",
    "a common observation of these studies is that the essential nonlinearities contained in the nontrivial tension profile lead to a mixing of short- and long - wavelength fluctuations , such that experimentally changing the equilibrium mode spectrum of contour fluctuations can have far more drastic consequences as usually suspected , for instance on the scenario - specific relaxation dynamics observed for polymers that were prepared in initially straight conformations by different means @xcite .",
    "it is well known that confinement leads to a changed fluctuation spectrum , because contour undulations with a wavelength longer than odijk s deflection length @xmath3 ( @xmath4 denoting the channel diameter ) @xcite are strongly suppressed . under many circumstances ,",
    "this merely leads to a renormalization of some characteristic length and time scales @xcite .",
    "however , in the light of the above we expect substantial changes for the dynamics of the tension along the contour . because of the widespread presence of confinement in common single - molecule experiments , we analyze the effects of confinement on the longitudinal response of semiflexible polymers in three generic scenarios ( cf .",
    "[ fig : scenarios ] ) .",
    "first , we consider the sudden stretching of a semiflexible chain in cylindrical confinement upon applying a constant `` pulling '' force at its ends .",
    "next , we discuss the inverse `` release '' scenario , where this stretching force is suddenly removed . compared to the corresponding unconfined scenarios analyzed previously , we find in both cases dynamic signatures strongly reminiscent of a prestress . in order to clearly elucidate the specific dynamical consequences of the different contour statistics of a chain confined to a channel",
    ", we finally address the idealized scenario where this constraint is suddenly removed",
    ". we will refer to this latter scenario as `` free relaxation from confinement '' ( frc ) .    .",
    "_ middle ( release ) _ : the confined polymer is equilibrated under an externally applied prestretching force @xmath5 , which is suddenly released . _ bottom ( free relaxation from confinement ) _ : the contour is equilibrated in confinement and relaxes in free space . in all cases ,",
    "the sudden change in external conditions propagates along the contour within growing boundary layers of size @xmath6 . ]",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section [ sec : e ] we present the basic mathematical formulation of the problem and derive the equations of motion .",
    "the linearized version of these equations of motion are investigated on a scaling level in section [ sec : s ] . there",
    "the physical principles behind all subsequently treated relaxation processes are illuminated and scaling laws governing the longitudinal dynamics are derived .",
    "section [ sec : a ] contains the analytical core of this work . after a brief survey of the ideas that lead hallatschek _",
    "@xcite to a refined formulation of the relaxation dynamics of semiflexible polymers , we adjust this description to the particular scenarios outlined above and investigate the tension dynamics within the various asymptotic limits .",
    "the following section [ sec : l ] builds upon these analytical results to discuss the longitudinal dynamics of the polymer s projected end - to - end distance .",
    "section [ sec : experiments ] quantifies our analytical findings in terms of numerical estimates for time , force , and length scales relevant in experiments .",
    "finally section [ sec : su ] summarizes the main results of this work .",
    "to determine the polymer s equations of motion , we resort to the wormlike chain model @xcite in its continuous version @xcite . according to this model the polymer",
    "is described by means of an inextensible continuous space curve @xmath7 and a bending hamiltonian @xmath8 introducing an energetic penalty proportional to the chain s ( squared ) curvature @xmath9 to account for bending rigidity ( primes indicate derivatives with respect to the arc length coordinate @xmath10 ) . in three dimensions",
    "the modulus @xmath11 is related to the persistence length @xmath2 , which characterizes the decay of tangent - tangent correlations along the contour , via @xmath12 . confinement in a hard - walled channel will be modeled by means of an additional harmonic potential @xmath13 punishing fluctuations @xmath14 away from the symmetry axis of the channel .",
    "the relation between the effective confinement strength @xmath15 and the diameter @xmath4 of the corresponding hard - walled channel is discussed in section [ sec : experiments ] ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . further introducing the backbone tension @xmath16 as a lagrange multiplier function ensuring local inextensibility of the chain ( @xmath17 ) @xcite",
    ", the hamiltonian reads @xmath18.\\ ] ] the polymer s overdamped motion thus follows from equating friction forces on the one hand and elastic and thermal forces on the other hand : @xmath19+\\bm{\\xi}(s , t).\\ ] ] the slender shape of the polymer allows to decompose the friction matrix @xmath20 $ ] into a parallel and transverse component @xcite , where the parameter @xmath21 quantifies the friction anisotropy .    in order to simplify notation , we shall set @xmath22 and @xmath23 from now on , making forces a length@xmath24 , times a length@xmath25 and the effective confinement strength @xmath15 a length@xmath26 .",
    "now , assuming the chain to be either strongly confined or sufficiently stiff , the transverse gradients @xmath27 become very small ( we will give a definition of @xmath28 in terms of the system s parameters below ) .",
    "moreover , choosing the @xmath29-axis to coincide with the direction of the polymer s extension allows us to effectively discriminate between transverse and longitudinal displacements and to write @xmath30 , where @xmath31 quantifies the amount of contour length stored in thermal undulations . for weakly bending polymers",
    "the inextensibility constraint @xmath32 implies @xmath33 and we may expand eq . in powers of @xmath28 .",
    "keeping terms up to order @xmath34 , we thus arrive at the following equations of motion , governing the chain s transverse and longitudinal dynamics :    [ eq : em ] @xmath35'+\\bm{\\xi}_{\\perp}\\\\ { \\hat{\\zeta}}\\partial_tr_{\\parallel } & = & ( { \\hat{\\zeta}}-1){\\mathbf}{r}_{\\perp}'^{t}\\partial_t{\\mathbf}{r}_{\\perp}-r_{\\parallel}''''-f'+\\left(fr_{\\parallel}'\\right)'+\\xi_{\\parallel}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    solving eqs . by means of ordinary perturbation theory only works for large enough times , but runs into trouble in the limit of short times .",
    "we will thus present a refined perturbation theory in section [ sec : a ] .",
    "much of the physics underlying the relaxation mechanisms of confined semiflexible chains can be understood by considering the interplay between the various characteristic length scales . apart from the contour length @xmath1 and the persistence length @xmath2 ,",
    "four additional length scales can be identified , which are crucial to the dynamics of such polymers ( see table [ tab : lengthscales ] for a summary ) .",
    "two static length scales may readily be inferred from the externally applied force @xmath5 and the confinement strength @xmath15 .",
    "a simple dimensional analysis reveals that , in our system of units , the length @xmath36 may be identified with odijk s deflection length @xcite , whereas the scale @xmath37 , set by the externally applied force , is nothing else but the very length for which @xmath5 represents the critical euler load .",
    "we shall refer to this latter scale as `` euler buckling length '' .",
    "apart from these static scales , two characteristic dynamical length scales have been identified to play a key role in the understanding of the polymer s relaxation dynamics , the first of which can easily be deduced using the linearized version of the equations of motion @xmath38 here we used @xmath39 ( to lowest order ) from the expansion of the longitudinal part of . denoting the characteristic length scale for transverse fluctuations by @xmath40 , inspection of eq . on a scaling level",
    "@xmath41 ( where the externally applied force @xmath5 sets the scale for the backbone tension @xmath42 ) immediately yields the scaling law for @xmath40 @xmath43 as will be obvious from a more detailed treatment of the linearized equation of motion in section [ sec : a ] , at time @xmath44 the transverse fluctuations of the polymer are in equilibrium with their surroundings on length scales @xmath45 , which is why we refer to @xmath40 as ( transverse ) `` equilibration length '' .",
    "note , in particular , that the second line of eq . only applies in cases where the euler buckling length is much smaller than odijk s deflection length .",
    "this last statement can be re - expressed in more intuitive terms .",
    "a simple dimensional analysis reveals that confinement induces a new force scale @xmath46 which we will refer to as `` effective confinement force '' .",
    "the concept of identifying confinement as an effective force will be central in the further course of our discussion .",
    "in particular , it allows to directly compare the strengths of applied forces and confinement . to this end",
    ", we introduce the `` force scale separation parameter '' @xmath47 measuring the effective confinement force @xmath46 in units of the externally applied force @xmath5 .",
    "so for the second scaling regime in eq . to occur , the effective confinement force @xmath46 has to be small compared to the externally applied force @xmath5 , viz .",

    ".summary of characteristic length scales [ cols=\"^ , < \" , ]",
    "in summary we have presented a detailed discussion of confinement effects on the relaxation dynamics of weakly bending polymers .",
    "our work was based on the investigation of three paradigmatic scenarios including a sudden application and release of a point force @xmath5 at the polymer s ends ( _ confined pulling _ and _ confined release _ ) , as well as _",
    "free relaxation from confinement ( frc)_.    in the context of tension propagation and longitudinal response we showed that for both force scenarios dynamical signatures resulting from confinements become visible only above a certain threshold for the effective confinement strength @xmath15 , which is given by @xmath49 .",
    "this translates into an upper channel diameter ( cf .",
    "eq . ) which imposes almost no restrictions for experiments on dna but requires channel widths below @xmath50 m for actin in order to observe effects caused by confinement",
    ". for weak confinement strengths the chain s dynamics reduces to that of unconfined chains . for sufficiently strong confinement",
    ", we introduced the force scale separation parameter @xmath51 in order to quantify the strength of confinement relative to the externally applied force @xmath5 .",
    "we showed that both cases @xmath52 and @xmath48 are accessible in experiments and consequently derived the chain s dynamics for comparably strong ( @xmath48 ) and weak ( @xmath52 ) forces @xmath5 .",
    "the scaling laws governing the longitudinal dynamics of confined chains in the two force scenarios turned out to bear close resemblance with those of prestretched polymers @xcite , suggesting to view confinement as effective prestretching force of strength @xmath53 in this context . in particular , the polymer s longitudinal response @xmath54 saturates at its new equilibrium value already for times @xmath55 ( cf . eqs . and ) , even though @xmath56 is smaller than the usually obtained value for the longest relaxation time .",
    "this behavior is explained by a suppression of long wave lengths in the mode spectrum of the stored length density due to confinement and has already been observed for prestretched chains where it was termed `` premature saturation '' @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of confinement as effective prestretching force carries over to the scenario of free relaxation from confinement ( frc ) , which is for late times identical to the release scenario discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , safe for a different prefactor of @xmath57 which arises as a consequence of somewhat different bulk conditions . for short times , however , the initially tension free contour builds up backbone tension in the bulk , which grows like @xmath58 before it saturates at the constant value @xmath59 .",
    "this tension build - up in turn affects the longitudinal dynamics of the chain , which responds superlinearly ( @xmath60 ) in this regime .",
    "the frc scenario thus constitutes an intriguing example of initially straight contours , which were discussed quite generally in ref .",
