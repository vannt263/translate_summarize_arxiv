    "graphene@xcite plays a unique role in materials science since it is the mother structure of most carbon @xmath0 nanosystems of current interest . by stacking , folding or bending a graphene sheet",
    "it is indeed possible to generate , respectively , graphite - like systems , fullerene cages ( pentagonal rings are here needed as well ) or nanotubes . in particular , the bending properties are critical in attaining the structural stability and morphology for both suspended and supported graphene sheets , and directly affect their electronic properties.@xcite rippling of pure graphene has been also observed with mesoscopic amplitude and wavelength , both for suspended monolayers@xcite and sheets deposited on substrates such as silicon dioxide.@xcite moreover , the bending properties play a central role in the design of graphene- or carbon nanotube - based devices , like e.g. mechanical resonators.@xcite the bending features of functionalized graphene sheets have been probed by atomic force microscopy , observing that the folding behavior is dominated by defects and functional groups.@xcite finally , bending ultimately governs the carbon nanotubes unzipping process , recently used to produce narrow ribbons for nanoelectronics.@xcite with the same technique , a new class of carbon - based nanostructures , which combine nanoribbons and nanotubes , has been introduced in order to obtain magnetoresistive devices.@xcite    within this scenario we frame the present investigation , addressed to improve our fundamental understanding of the bending properties of a one - atom thick carbon sheet .",
    "the main goal is twofold : ( i ) to draw a thorough theoretical picture on bending , fully exploiting the elasticity theory and providing an atomistic quantitative estimation of the corresponding bending rigidity ; ( ii ) to prove that the bending process of a carbon nanoribbon is always associated with the emergence of a ( small ) stretching , particularly close to the edges .",
    "these results have been obtained by combining continuum elasticity theory and tight - binding atomistic simulations ( tb - as ) .    the conceptual development and actual exploitation of our theoretical model proceeds through the following steps .",
    "at first , by means of continuum mechanics we have obtained the exact shape for a purely bended nanoribbon , by imposing suitable boundary conditions . the bending rigidity",
    "is then evaluated by tb - as for several nanoribbons differing by length and width . as a second step",
    ", we observed that , under the above assumption of pure bending , the corresponding rigidity must be a constant independent of the actual shape of the sheet .",
    "nevertheless by allowing full atomic - scale relaxation during bending , we rather found a geometry - dependent rigidity , a feature that we have attributed to the onset of stretching phenomena .",
    "therefore , as final step , we have developed a procedure to discriminate between stretching and bending energy , so providing a complete picture about the mechanical behavior of graphene and also reconciling the atomistic data with the continuum theory results .",
    "the structure of the paper follows : in section ii we outline the theoretical framework from both the continuum elasticity theory and the tight - binding atomistic simulations point of view . in section iii",
    "we describe the results concerning the bending stiffness and the interplay between stretching and bending . finally , in section iv we draw the conclusions .",

    "while the bending moment for the kirchhoff plate derives from a compression / extension of the different material layers forming the thickness @xmath19 , in graphene it is due to the interactions among orbitals @xmath24 which are affected by the bending process .",
    "therefore , the determination of @xmath7 and @xmath8 for graphene is a well - posed ( and , to a large extent , still open ) problem , which is independent of the evaluation of @xmath4 and @xmath6.@xcite    our model system is a rectangular ribbon with length @xmath25 and width @xmath26 ( see fig.[capt : geometri3d ] ) .",
    "the ribbon is bended without stretching ( @xmath27 ) along its width .",

    "applications to molecular - dynamics studies of liquid carbon and small carbon clusters indicate that this model correctly describes carbon systems over a wide range of environments.@xcite this approach has been successfully used to show that the surface of nanodiamond particles reconstructs in a fullerenelike manner , generating carbon clusters called bucky diamonds.@xcite moreover , the growth of nanostructures ( linear , ring , and fullerenelike objects ) in a carbon plasma@xcite and the formation of carbon clusters ( onion - like and endohedral structures ) from the condensation of liquid droplets@xcite have been simulated by the present tight - binding model .",
    "finally , this parametrization has been recently used for determining the nonlinear elastic moduli governing the graphene stretching elasticity.@xcite    the previous continuum analysis is useful both to create the input configurations for atomistic calculations and to define the simulation protocol .",
    "the investigated system consists in a nanoribbon formed by a perfect hexagonal carbon lattice , having width @xmath26 in the range 4 - 12 nm and length @xmath44 imposed to obtain a simulation box containing a constant number of @xmath66 carbon atoms .",
    "morever , periodic boundary conditions are assumed along the direction of the length @xmath44 . the length ( width )",
    "is developed along the armchair ( zig - zag ) direction of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "each nanoribbon is deformed as defined in eqs.([eq : parametric geometry ] ) and ( [ eq : parametric geometry2 ] ) in ten configurations corresponding to different values of @xmath28 . in any bended configuration , all the interatomic distances are fixed at the equilibrium value for flat graphene ( so that no bond stretching is for the moment allowed ) . the bending rigidity has been straightforwardly obtained as @xmath67 with @xmath68 given by eq.([eq : energy integral ] ) , where the integral @xmath69 is computed for the given configuration .",
    "it is important to remark that the obtained value for @xmath7 must be independent of the actual configuration since the deformation is a pure bending one .",
    "accordingly to the scheme outlined in the previous section , we have firstly evaluated the ( pure ) bending energy as @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 represent the tb - as total energy of the bended ( but not relaxed ) and equilibrium ( flat ) configurations , respectively .",
    "the atomistic results for @xmath7 are reported in fig.[capt:72 ] ( symbols ) as function of the @xmath73 ratio and for different width @xmath26 .",
    "we estimate an average value @xmath74 ev . while the reported values of @xmath7 ( for nanotubes ) vary in the range 1 ev@xmath752 ev , @xcite we remark the most reliable _ ab - initio _ data @xmath76 ev , @xcite and @xmath77 ev , @xcite are in excellent agreement with our prediction , a feature standing for the reliability of the present computational procedure .",

    "therefore , full relaxation of the internal degrees of freedom of the bended systems is performed by zero temperature damped dynamics until interatomic forces resulted not larger than @xmath78ev /  .",
    "we have so generated a new set of configurations where bending and stretching features are entangled . during the relaxation ,",
    "the positions of the atoms belonging to the edges ( i.e. atoms with @xmath79 or @xmath80 , see fig.[capt : geometri3d ] ) are fixed and , therefore , the distance @xmath28 between the edges remained constant .",
    "overall we observed that the geometry is only marginally affected by relaxation as shown in fig.[fig : graphene angles ] .",
    "here we compare the attack angle @xmath29 predicted from eq.([eq : edge distance ] ) versus the ratio @xmath73 with the corresponding values obtained from the relaxed configurations .",
    "we note that , for @xmath81 , we obtain the universal value @xmath82 as previously discussed . as a matter of fact , after the relaxation , the attack angle @xmath29 do not change and the maximum variation of @xmath26 was as little as @xmath83 nm , corresponding to a variation of the integral @xmath84 smaller than @xmath85 .",
    "nevertheless , even for such minor relaxations the energetics of the fully relaxed systems is expected to sizeably differ from the purely bended case , because of the extraordinary large value of the graphene young modulus.@xcite it is therefore important to provide a new estimation of the bending energy for the fully relaxed configurations .    following the above argument",
    ", we evaluated the new bending rigidity @xmath7 by means of the energy @xmath86 and eq.([eq : energy integral ] ) , where @xmath87 is the energy of a relaxed bended ribbon and @xmath88 is the energy of a flat ribbon after a full relaxation ( different from the energy of the infinite graphene sheet because of the edge effects ) . in this case , we have found a variation of @xmath7 upon @xmath73 as shown in fig.[fig : bending rigidity ] ( full circles ) .",
    "this result suggests that atomic - scale relaxations upon bending have induced as expected an additional field of in - plane stretching , which provides new energy contributions as reported in eq.([eq : density energy ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the largest differences between the unrelaxed and relaxed configurations are found for @xmath89 .",
    "in fact , in this case the forces exerted by the constraints ( maintaining the distance @xmath28 between the edges ) are almost parallel to the graphene sheet , favoring the stretching emergence .",

    "we have defined a proof - of - concept computational procedure based on the virtual process of straightening ( or unbending ) of a given relaxed and bended ribbon : atoms are projected from such a configuration onto a plane by conserving all the 1nn bond lengths and all the 2nn planar angles .",
    "the process recovers a planar configuration , still maintaining all the details about any possible stretching ( in - plane strain field ) ; the corresponding energy @xmath91 is straightforwardly evaluated by means of tb - as .",
    "the bending rigidity @xmath7 can be consequently determined by using @xmath92 : the results are shown in fig.[fig : bending flat ] ( crosses ) where we also report @xmath7 as obtained by @xmath93 ( open circles ) .",
    "the comparison points out a good agreement between the two different approaches since stretching features are either at all non considered ( open circles ) or included in both the bended and flat configurations ( crosses ) so as to compensate .",
    "it is interesting to note that the constant trend of @xmath7 versus @xmath32 and @xmath94 has been found similar to fig.[capt:72 ] . in other words ,",
    "we have proved that the evaluation of @xmath95 through the energy term @xmath86 is not correct since it is corrupted by a strain energy amount which is not directly related to the bending process .",
    "the energy due to the sole stretching field ( induced by the bending process ) can be accordingly defined as @xmath96 .",
    "the demonstration that such an energetic contribution corresponds only to stretching relies on the fact that both the terms @xmath97 and @xmath98 have been evaluated on flat ribbons through tb atomistic simulations .",

    "we can calculate three strain fields @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 which are respectively defined as the relative difference between : ( i ) the relaxed and straightened configuration ( energy @xmath91 ) and the flat relaxed configuration ( energy @xmath88 ) ; ( ii ) the flat relaxed configuration ( energy @xmath88 ) and the flat unrelaxed configuration ( energy @xmath72 ) ; ( iii ) the relaxed and straightened configuration ( energy @xmath91 ) and the flat unrelaxed configuration ( energy @xmath72 ) . while the strain @xmath101 is only due to bending , the term @xmath102 is induced by the presence of the edges ( finite nanoribbon ) in a flat configuration .",
    "the quantity @xmath103 represents the total strain induced by the relaxation of the bended ribbon with reference to the ideal graphene sheet .",
    "we observed with good accuracy the validity of the relation @xmath108 , further proving that the total strain in a bended ribbon is the sum of two different contributions : the first one ( @xmath101 ) is directly related to the bending process and the second one ( @xmath102 ) is originated by edges effects , i.e. by the finite size of the nanoribbon .",
    "although the first term seems to be quite negligible with respect to the second one , the previous energetic analysis reveals that both contributions are essential in order to explain the discrepancies between continuum and atomistic results .",
