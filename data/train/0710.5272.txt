    "in this paper we deal with the classical image restoration problem of blurred and noisy images in the case of a space invariant blurring . under such assumption",
    "the image formation process is modelled according to the following integral equation with space invariant kernel @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the true physical object to be restored , @xmath2 is the recorded blurred and noisy image , @xmath3 takes into account unknown errors in the collected data , e.g. measurement errors and noise.as customary , we consider the discretization of ( [ eq : modello_continuo ] ) by means of a standard @xmath4 generalization of the rectangle quadrature formula on an equispaced grid , ordered row - wise from the top - left corner to the bottom - right one .",
    "hence , we obtain the relations @xmath5 in which an infinite and a shift - invariant matrix @xmath6_{(i , j)=((i_1,i_2),(j_1,j_2))}$ ] , i.e. , a two - level toeplitz matrix , is involved.in principle , ( [ eq : modello_discreto_base ] ) presents an infinite summation since the true image scene does not have a finite boundary .",
    "nevertheless , the data @xmath7 are clearly collected only at a finite number of values , so representing only a finite region of such an infinite scene .",
    "in addition , the blurring operator typically shows a finite support , so that it is completely described by a point spread function ( psf ) mask such as @xmath8_{i_1=-q_1,\\ldots , q_1,i_2=-q_2,\\ldots , q_2}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 for any @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( normalization according to a suitable conservation law).therefore , relations ( [ eq : modello_discreto_base ] ) imply @xmath14 where the range of collected data defines the so called field of view ( fov).once again , we are assuming that all the involved data in ( [ eq : modello_discreto_sistema ] ) , similarly to ( [ eq : modello_discreto_base ] ) , are reshaped in a row - wise ordering . in such a way we obtain the linear system @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a finite principal sub - matrix of @xmath17 , with main diagonal containing @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and with @xmath21 , for any two - index @xmath22 .",
    "such a reshape is considered just to perform the theoretical analysis , since all the deblurring / denoising methods are able to deal directly with data in matrix form . for instance , it is evident that the blurring process in ( [ eq : modello_discreto ] ) consists in a discrete convolution between the psf mask , after a rotation of @xmath23 , and the proper true image data in @xmath24_{i_1=-q_1 + 1,\\ldots , n_1+q_1,i_2=-q_2 + 1,\\ldots , n_2+q_2}.\\ ] ] hereafter , with a two - index notation , we denote by @xmath25_{i_1=1,\\ldots , n_1,i_2=1,\\ldots , n_2}$ ] the true image inside the fov and by @xmath26_{i_1=1,\\ldots , n_1,i_2=1,\\ldots , n_2}$ ] the recorded image .",
    "thus , assuming the knowledge of psf mask in ( [ eq : coefficienti_psf ] ) and of some statistical properties of @xmath3 , the deblurring problem is defined as to restore , as best as possible , the true image @xmath27 on the basis of the recorded image @xmath28 . as evident from ( [ eq : modello_discreto ] ) , the problem is undetermined since the number of unknowns involved in the convolution exceeds the number of recorded data .",
    "boundary conditions ( bcs ) are introduced to artificially describe the scene outside the fov : the values of unknowns outside the fov are fixed or are defined as linear combinations of the unknowns inside the fov , the target being to reduce ( [ eq : modello_discreto_sistema ] ) into a square linear system @xmath29 with @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33.the choice of the bcs does not affect the global spectral behavior of the matrix .",
    "however , it may have a valuable impact both with respect to the accuracy of the restored image and to the computational costs for recovering @xmath1 from the blurred datum , with or without noise .",
    "notice also that , typically , the matrix @xmath34 is very ill - conditioned and there is a significant intersection between the subspace related to small eigen / singular values and the high frequency subspace .",
    "such a feature requires the use of suitable regularization methods that allow to properly restore the image @xmath27 with controlled noise levels @xcite , among which we can cite truncated svd , tikhonov , and total variation @xcite.hereafter , we focus our attention on special case of psfs satisfying a strong symmetry property , i.e. , such that @xmath35 this assumption is fulfilled in the majority of models in real optical applications . for instance , in most 2d astronomical imaging with optical lens @xcite the model of the psf is circularly symmetric , and hence , strongly symmetric ; in the multi - image deconvolution of some recent interferometric telescopes , the psf is strongly symmetric too @xcite .",
    "moreover , in real applications when the psf is obtained by measurements ( like a guide star in astronomy ) , the influence of noise leads to a numerically nonsymmetric psf , also when the kernel of the psf is strongly ( or centro ) symmetric .",
    "in such a case , by employing a symmetrized version of the measured psf , comparable restorations are observed @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sez : bc ] we focus on two recently proposed bcs , i.e. , the reflective @xcite and anti - reflective bcs @xcite and their relevant properties . section [ sez : filtering_methods ] summarizes some classical filtering techniques as the truncated singular / eigen - values decomposition and the tikhonov method .",
    "the re - blurring method @xcite is considered in the case of anti - reflective bcs and its re - interpretation in the framework of the classical tikhonov regularization is given . in section [ sez : cross_channel_blurring ] the model is generalized for taking into account the cross - channel blurring phenomenon and the previous filtering methods are suitable adapted .",
    "lastly , section [ sez : numerical_tests ] deals with some computational issues and reports several numerical tests , the aim being to compare the quoted filtering methods and the two type of bcs , both in the case of gray - scale and color images . in section [ sez : conclusioni ] some conclusions and remarks end the paper .",
    "in this section we summarize the relevant properties of two recently proposed type of bcs , i.e. , the reflective @xcite and anti - reflective bcs @xcite .",
    "special attention is given to the structural and spectral properties of the arising matrices .",
    "in fact , though the choice of the bcs does not affect the global spectral behavior of the matrix @xmath34 , it can have a valuable impact with respect both to the accuracy of the restoration ( especially close to the boundaries where ringing effects can appear ) , and the computational costs for recovering the image from the blurred one , with or without noise .",
    "moreover , tanking into account the scale of the problem , the regularization methods analysis can be greatly simplified whenever a spectral ( or singular value ) decomposition of @xmath34 is easily available .",
    "this means that the target is to obtain the best possible approximation properties , keeping unaltered the fact that the arising matrix shows an exploitable structure .",
    "for instance , the use of periodic bcs enforces a circulant structure , so that the spectral decomposition can be computed efficiently with the fast fourier transform ( fft ) @xcite . despite these computational facilities , they give rise to significant ringing effects when a significant discontinuity is introduced into the image .",
    "hereafter , we focus on two recently proposed boundary conditions , that more carefully describe the scene outside the fov.clearly , several other methods deal with this topic in the image processing literature , e.g. local mean value @xcite or extrapolation techniques ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , the penalty of their good approximation properties could lie in a linear algebra problem more difficult to cope with .      in @xcite ng _ et al .",
    "_ analyze the use of reflective bcs , both from model and linear algebra point of view .",
    "the improvement with respect to periodic bcs is due to the preservation of the continuity of the image .",
    "in fact , the scene outside the fov is assumed to be a reflection of the scene inside the fov .",
    "for example , with a boundary at @xmath36 and @xmath37 the reflective condition is given by @xmath38.more precisely , along the borders , the bcs impose @xmath39 and , at the corners , the bcs impose for any @xmath40 , @xmath41 @xmath42 i.e. , a double reflection , first with respect to one axis and after with respect to the other , no matter about the order.as a consequence the rectangular matrix @xmath43 is reduced to a square toeplitz - plus - hankel block matrix with toeplitz - plus - hankel blocks , i.e. , @xmath44 shows the two - level toeplitz - plus - hankel structure .",
    "moreover , if the blurring operator satisfies the strong symmetry condition ( [ eq : strong_simmetry_condition ] ) then the matrix @xmath44 belongs to dct - iii matrix algebra .",
    "therefore , its spectral decomposition can be computed very efficiently using the fast discrete cosine transform ( dct - iii ) @xcite.more in detail , let @xmath45 be the two - level dct - iii matrix algebra , i.e. , the algebra of matrices that are simultaneously diagonalized by the orthogonal transform @xmath46_{s , t=1}^m,\\ ] ] with @xmath47 denoting the kronecker symbol.thus , the explicit structure of the matrix is @xmath48 , with @xmath49 $ ] and where each @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the unilevel dct - iii matrix associated to the @xmath52 row of the psf mask , i.e. , @xmath53 , with @xmath54 $ ] . here ,",
    "we denote by @xmath55 the shift operator such that @xmath56 $ ] and by @xmath57 the usual flip matrix ; at the block level the same operations are intended in block - wise sense.beside this structural characterization , the spectral description is completely known .",
    "in fact , let @xmath1 be the bivariate generating function associated to the psf mask ( [ eq : coefficienti_psf ] ) , that is @xmath58 then the eigenvalues of the corresponding matrix @xmath59 are given by @xmath60},x_{s_2}^{[n_2]}\\right),\\ s=(s_1,s_2 ) , \\quad x_r^{[m]}=\\frac{(r-1)\\pi}{m},\\ ] ] where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and where the two - index notation highlights the tensorial structure of the corresponding eigenvectors.lastly , notice that standard operations like matrix - vector products , resolution of linear systems and eigenvalues evaluations can be performed by means of fct - iii @xcite within @xmath63 arithmetic operations ( ops ) .",
    "for example , by multiplying by @xmath64^t$ ] both the sides of @xmath65 , it holds that @xmath66_{(i_1,i_2)}= [ r_n^t ( a_n e_1)]_{(i_1,i_2 ) } / [ r_n^t e_1]_{(i_1,i_2 ) } , \\quad i_1=1,\\ldots , n_1 , i_2=1,\\ldots , n_2,\\ ] ] i.e. , it is enough to consider an inverse fct - iii applied to the first column of @xmath44 , with a computational cost of @xmath67 ops .      more recently , anti - reflective boundary conditions ( ar - bcs ) have been proposed in @xcite and studied @xcite .",
    "the improvement is due to the fact that not only the continuity of the image , but also of the normal derivative , are guaranteed at the boundary .",
    "this regularity , which is not shared with dirichlet or periodic bcs , and only partially shared with reflective bcs , significantly reduces typical ringing artifacts.the key idea is simply to assume that the scene outside the fov is the anti - reflection of the scene inside the fov .",
    "for example , with a boundary at @xmath36 the anti - reflexive condition impose @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the center of the one - dimensional anti - reflection , i.e. , @xmath70 in order to preserve a tensorial structure , at the corners , a double anti - reflection , first with respect to one axis and after with respect to the other , is considered , so that the bcs impose @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the center of the two - dimensional anti-reflection.more precisely , by choosing as center of the anti - reflection the first available data , along the borders , the bcs impose @xmath73 at the corners , the bcs impose for any @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath74 as a consequence the rectangular matrix @xmath75 is reduced to a square toeplitz - plus - hankel block matrix with toeplitz - plus - hankel blocks , plus an additional structured low rank matrix .",
    "moreover , under the assumption of strong symmetry of the psf and of a mild finite support condition ( more precisely @xmath76 if @xmath77 , for some @xmath78 ) , the resulting linear system @xmath79 is such that @xmath44 belongs to the @xmath80 commutative matrix algebra @xcite .",

    "we compare the effectiveness of truncated spectral decompositions ( sds ) with respect to the standard truncated svds both in the case of reflective and anti - reflective bcs . due to scale of the problem ,",
    "the svd of the matrix @xmath44 is in general an expensive computational task ( and not negligible also in the case of a separable psf ) .",

    "more in detail , the rre is analyzed by progressively adding a new basis element at a time , according to the non - decreasing order of the singular / eigen - values ( the eigenvalues are ordered with respect to their absolute value).in the case of sds ( or svds related to a separable psf ) this can be done as described in section [ sez : computational_issues ] and , beside the preliminary cost related to the decomposition computation , the addition of a new term has a computational cost equal to @xmath252 ops .",
    "the algorithm proposed in @xcite , that makes use of the anti - reflective direct and inverse transforms , is less expensive in the case of tests with few threshold values.hereafter , the aim is to compare the truncated svd with the truncated sd restorations both in the case of reflective and anti - reflective bcs .",
    "periodic bcs are not analyzed here , since reflective and anti - reflective bcs give better performances with respect to the approximation of the image at the boundary.in table [ tab : sigma2_cameraman_psfgauss ] and [ tab : sigma5_cameraman_psfgauss ] we report the results obtained by varying the dimension of the psf support , the parameter @xmath245 related to the amount of the noise perturbation and the variance of the considered gaussian blur .",
    "as expected the optimal rre worses as the parameter @xmath245 increases and the anti - reflective bcs show better performances in the case of low noise levels .",
    "in fact , for low @xmath245 values , the reduction of ringing artifacts is significant , while the quality of the restoration for higher @xmath245 values is essentially driven by the goal of noise filtering .",
    "therefore , in such a case , the choice of the bcs becomes more an more meaningless since it is not able to influence the image restoration quality .",
