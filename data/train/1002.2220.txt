    "dark matter s presence is inferred from gravitational effects on visible matter at astronomical scales .",
    "a wide range of observational data show that the dark matter is cold or warm ( i.e. it became non - relativistic before or at the time of galaxy formation ) and composes about 23@xmath2 of the total density of the universe @xcite .",
    "there are no viable candidates for dark matter within the standard model of elementary particles , but many in proposed extensions of the standard model . among these , weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) of mass in the 100 gev to several tev range provide a natural explanation for the observed dark matter density @xcite .",
    "we are going to concentrate on wimps in this paper .",
    "although the detection of dark matter particles may be possible at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , finding them in direct or indirect dark matter searches will be necessary to determine if they are indeed stable on cosmological timescales and how abundant they are at present @xcite .",
    "many direct or indirect dark matter searches are being carried on at present @xcite .",
    "indirect dark matter searches look for wimp annihilation ( or sometimes decay ) products , either photons @xcite or anomalous cosmic rays , such as positrons and antiprotons @xcite , or neutrinos @xcite . for some years",
    ", observations of an excess in the positron fraction @xmath3 by heat ( the high energy antimatter telescope ) @xcite , a bright 511 kev gamma - ray line from the galactic center by integral ( the international gamma ray astrophysics laboratory ) @xcite and a possible unaccounted - for component of the foreground of wmap around the galactic center , the  wmap haze \"  @xcite ( among others ) have been considered possible hints of wimp dark matter annihilations .",
    "more recently , the pamela satellite ( payload of antimatter matter exploration and light - nuclei astrophysics ) reported an excess in the positron fraction in the energy range of 10 - 100 gev with respect to what is expected from cosmic rays secondaries @xcite , which confirmed the heat excess . also atic ( the advanced thin ionization calorimeter ) and ppb - bets ( the polar patrol balloon and balloon borne electron telescope with scintillating fibers ) observed a bump in the @xmath4+@xmath5 flux from 200 to 800 gev @xcite , but",
    "this was not confirmed by the air cherenkov telescope hess @xcite and by the fermi gamma ray telescope .",
    "fermi found a slight excess in the e@xmath6+e@xmath7 flux between 200 gev and 1 tev @xcite .",
    "indirect searches for dark matter annihilations via neutrinos with experiments such as amanda ( antarctic muon and neutrino detector array ) @xcite and icecube @xcite also constrain dark matter models .",
    "the cubic kilometer size neutrino telescope ( km3net ) , planned to be built at the bottom of the mediterranean sea @xcite , will provide additional constraints , with its different view of the sky and in particular , the galactic center .",
    "many theoretical studies have concentrated on the indirect dark matter detection via neutrino signals @xcite .",
    "the positron excess observed by pamela may be explained by the presence of particular astrophysical sources ( e.g. , pulsars ) @xcite , or by the annihilation @xcite or decay @xcite of dark matter particles .",
    "if the observed anomalies in the pamela and fermi data are due to dark matter annihilation , a larger annihilation rate than expected for typical thermal relics must be assumed .",
    "this enhancement may happen due to either large inhomogeneities in the dark matter distribution near earth ( subhaloes ) and/or a larger annihilation cross section of the dark matter particles .",
    "this last possibility may happen if the dark matter particles are not thermal relics @xcite , in which case they can have larger annihilation cross sections in the early universe , or due to an enhancement of the annihilation cross section only at very low velocities @xcite , which would not affect their annihilation in the early universe .",
    "whatever its origin may be , the needed enhancement is quantified by a  boost factor , \" @xmath8 , ranging from 10 to 10@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the typical wimp thermal relic annihilation cross section is @xmath10 .",
    "wimp models explaining the pamela positron excess must be peculiar in other aspects as well . to avoid overproduction of antiprotons ,",
    "the dark matter annihilation or decay must proceed dominantly to leptons .",
    "moreover , the absence of a sharp shoulder in the electron plus positron spectrum ( that had been observed by atic ) in the fermi data corresponding to an energy close to the parent dark matter particle mass means that the direct production of electrons must be suppressed with respect to the production of electrons ( and positrons ) as secondaries .",

    "neutrinos with energies of the order of the dark matter mass , @xmath13 , would propagate without being deflected towards the earth .",
    "however , during their travel , vacuum oscillation effects would mix the three flavors .",
    "some fraction of the arriving muon neutrinos would be converted into muons via charged current interactions in the earth which can be detected in earth based neutrino telescopes .",
    "neutrino signals in underground or underwater detectors of dark matter annihilation in the galactic center are the subject of this paper .",
    "we calculate the neutrino induced upward and contained muon flux , as well as the neutrino induced muon and shower event rates due to dark matter annihilation in the galactic center .",
    "we take into account the muon propagation in the earth when evaluating the upward muon flux @xcite and study the energy range of muons for which upward muon events dominate over the contained ones .",
    "we show that the shape of upward muon fluxes differs significantly from the shape of the neutrino spectra at production , due to the smearing produced by neutrino interactions and muon propagation .",
    "the muon propagation shifts the flux to lower energies , while the contained muon flux increases with muon energy due to the linear energy dependence of the neutrino charged - current interaction .",
    "we consider different wimps annihilation channels that contribute to the neutrino signal , including direct annihilation to neutrinos , to charged leptons and to quarks or gauge bosons .",
    "we evaluate rates of contained events and upward events , of relevance to icecube and future neutrino detectors like km3net .    in the next section ,",
    "we evaluate expressions for muon flux from the incident neutrino flux interacting with the medium . in section",
    "iii we present our results for muon flux and muon event rates from the annihilation of the dark matter in the galactic center compared with the atmospheric background and evaluate rates for hadronic and electromagnetic showers .",
    "finally , in section iv we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "the neutrino flux at the earth due to the annihilation of dark matter particles with mass @xmath14 in the galactic center is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the annihilation rate given by : @xmath17 @xmath18 is the neutrino spectrum at the production for a given annihilation channel @xmath19 with branching fraction @xmath20 , @xmath8 is the boost factor , @xmath21 is the dark matter density , integral is over the line of sight ( l.o.s ) within a solid angle @xmath22 , centered in the galactic center . the neutrino energy distribution , @xmath23 , depends on the particle produced .",
    "some examples appear in appendix a. for all of the evaluations below , we take the dark matter annihilation cross section to have the typical thermal relic value @xmath24 .    for practical reasons the dimensionless quantity @xmath25 is defined in which the dark matter density profile @xmath21 is embedded @xcite , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the distance from us in the direction of @xmath28 which is the cone half angle from the galactic center , @xmath29 is the distance of the solar system from the galactic center and @xmath30 is the local density near the solar system , which are taken to be @xmath31 kpc and @xmath32 gev@xmath33 . as a practical matter",
    ", we consider two profiles , the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw)@xcite profile and a cored isothermal profile .",
    "some typical values for @xmath34 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath34= 6.0(10.0 ) for @xmath35 for the nfw profile , and @xmath34= 1.3(4.3 ) with @xmath35 for the isothermal profile .",
    "the high energy neutrinos coming from the galactic center then interact with the matter in the earth and produce muons that traverse to the detector ( upward events ) , or they interact in the detector producing muons or showers ( contained events ) .",
    "muon range or stopping distance , @xmath36 , is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 corresponds to the ionization energy loss and @xmath39 accounts for the bremsstrahlung , pair production and photonuclear interactions .",
    "for example , for a muon with initial energy @xmath40 1 tev , when @xmath41 the muon range is roughly @xmath42 km whereas the decay length of a muon with the same initial energy is much larger ( @xmath43 a few thousand kilometers ) .",
    "for detectors with a characteristic size of 1 km@xmath44 , contained events are most important for wimp masses below about 1 tev , while for smaller detectors like superk , upward events are relatively more important .    using eq.(1 ) and following the theoretical framework presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , the upward muon flux at the detector is given by @xmath45 here @xmath46 accounts for muon energy loss in transit from its production position to the muon s entry into the detector .",

    "we have studied neutrino signals from dark matter annihilation in the galactic center .",
    "we have calculated contained and upward muon fluxes from neutrino interactions , when neutrinos are produced in annihilation of dark matter either directly or via the decay of taus , w - bosons or b - quarks .",
    "we have shown that in the case of direct neutrino production , the signal is above the atmospheric background for both contained and upward events , assuming that the annihilation rate is enhanced by boost factor of 200 ( when the nfw dark matter halo profile is used ) and that the branching ratio of dark mater annihilation into neutrinos is one . in general , the boost factor values that are required to explain the data obtained by the indirect detection experiments vary depending on the dark matter model and the dark matter mass .",
    "for the specific dark matter model our results can be rescaled by the corresponding product of the boost factor @xmath8 and the branching ratio @xmath20 .",
    "we have found that the contained muon flux dominates over the upward muon flux for all energies when @xmath63 gev . however , as we increase the mass @xmath14 of the dark matter particle , for example when @xmath64 gev , the upward muon flux dominates up to @xmath65 gev , and for @xmath66 gev , up to @xmath67 gev .",
    "this is due to the increasing muon range as the muon initial energy increases , which becomes possible when @xmath14 is larger thus producing higher energy neutrinos in the annihilation . in the case of secondary neutrino production ,",
    "the signal becomes comparable to the background if the boost factor is an order of magnitude larger than the value we considered .",
    "we have shown that the shape of the muon flux depends on the specific decay mode , and that the dominant flux comes from tau decay at low muon energies , and from w - decay for muon energies above 200 gev .",
    "the total upward muon rates have a weak dependence on @xmath14 and on the muon energy threshold for @xmath68 gev , due to the balance of the energy dependence of the muon range , the upper limit of the muon energy ( given by @xmath14 ) and the explicit dependence on @xmath14 ( @xmath69 ) of the muon flux .",
    "however , the total contained muon rates show a sharp decrease with @xmath14 for @xmath70 gev due to the finite size of the detector .",
    "upward muon events dominate over contained muon events for @xmath71 gev .",
    "we have also shown that showers produced by neutrino interactions , when neutrinos are produced directly in dark matter annihilation , could also be used to detect a dark matter signal from the galactic center .",
    "in particular , electromagnetic showers have much smaller background , from atmospheric electron neutrinos , than the hadronic showers .",
    "in addition , we have studied the contour plots of both the upward muon events and the showers and we have shown the required dependence of the annihilation cross section on the dark matter mass in order to observe a fixed number of event rates .",
    "we have discussed the origin of different shapes for the contour curves in each case and pointed out the contained event nature of the shower events .",
    "we have shown that after one year icecube+deepcore detector could potentially observe a 5@xmath72 signal effect by measuring contained muons ( for direct neutrino production ) , or in @xmath73 to @xmath74 years a 2@xmath72 effect with hadronic showers even in the case when they are due to secondary neutrinos .",
    "icecube+deepcore will be able to identify track - like events due to the charged current interactions of muon neutrinos , the showers due to neutral current interactions of all the neutrino flavors and the charged current interactions of electron and tau neutrinos . in particular , above the neutrino energy of 40 gev the signal to background ratio for showers is further enhanced since the atmospheric tau and electron neutrino fluxes are suppressed relative to the atmospheric muon neutrino flux .",
    "thus , the main background is the neutral current interaction whose cross section is about a factor of three less than the charged current cross section of the atmospheric muon neutrinos .",
    "the measurement of the ratio of track - like muon and shower events eliminates the dependence on some parameters of the theory ( e.g. , boost factor , the dark matter density profile , etc ) which only determine the overall normalization for the energy dependent differential muon fluxes , so the physical properties of the dark matter particle can better be determined .",
    "in addition to the boost factor due to sommerfeld enhancement that we have considered , there is potential enhancement of the dark matter signal due to the existence of small substructures in the milky way halo @xcite .",
    "possible observation of this additional boost may be difficult to observe because of the small population of these substructures unless the neutrino detectors have a very good angular resolution @xcite .",
    "due to its location in the northern hemisphere , the future km3net experiment will be complementary to icecube+deepcore in searching for neutrino signals from dark matter annihilation in the galactic center through the observation of upward muon events .",
    "the atmospheric muon background at the km3net will be suppressed significantly since the earth will act as a shield to those muons .",
    "independent searches of the upward muon events by km3net and the contained muon and shower events by icecube+deepcore look promising for the discovery of the mysterious dark matter particle or for setting stringent constraints on its properties .    we would like to thank tyce deyoung , sven lafebre , irina mocioiu , anna stasto and tolga guver for useful discussions . is and gg would like to thank the aspen center for physics , where part of this work took place .",
