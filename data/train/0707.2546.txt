    "the high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) from atoms and molecules has been one of the most intensely studied aspects of strong - field physics@xcite , because it can be applied as a coherent ultrashort radiation source in the extreme ultraviolet(xuv ) and soft x - ray regions@xcite . due to the multi - center characteristics and greater freedom ,",
    "the molecules show more complicated structures in their hhg spectrum than atoms and the dynamics of molecules in the external field is more difficult to investigate .    among many treatments ,",
    "the semiclassical recollision model@xcite is an applaudable theory that provides a appropriate picture for hhg . in this model ,",
    "the high harmonics are generated by a three - step sequence : ( 1 ) tunnel ionization of the highest energy of the electron , ( 2 ) acceleration of the free electron in the laser field , and driving the electron back to the parent ion , ( 3 ) recombination of the electron to the state from which it originated .",
    "the recombination step leads to the emission of a xuv photon whose energy is given by the sum of the electron of kinetic energy plus the ionization potential of the state .",
    "a widely used semianalytical approach to describe hhg is the strong field approximation ( sfa ) or lewenstein model @xcite , which is applicable to the molecules .",
    "it can be regarded as the quantum mechanical version of the semiclassical recollision model .",
    "the lewenstein model has the advantage of requiring less computational effort than the @xmath0 solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation , which becomes very demanding at high laser intensities .",
    "another advantage of the model is that it yields a physical interpretation of the underlying mechanisms and a certain degree of analytical description .",
    "recently , several theoretical and experimental reports study two - center interference on the hhg from molecules of h@xmath1@xcite and co@xmath2@xcite .",
    "lein @xmath3 observed the phenomenon and attributed it to the returning electron wave colliding with cores of the two - center molecule , where an interference occurs@xcite .",
    "they found that the interference effects are sensitive to the molecular orientation but not to the laser parameters .",
    "ciappina @xmath3 use the sfa model to study two - center interference@xcite .",
    "they compared the sfa prediction of the interference - minimum position to the exact value obtained from the @xmath0 calculations .",
    "they observe that using the two - center continuum wave functions , instead of a plane wave to describe the continuum electron , greatly improves the comparison .",
    "the usage of the continuum wave functions can be considered an attempt to account for coulomb effects on the returning electron .    the previous discussions , however , are mainly toward the molecules with small internuclear distance @xmath4 .",
    "detailed investigations for the interference effects on hhg from molecules with large @xmath4 are still in lack . for the large internuclear distance case , strong coupling between the ground state and the first excited",
    "state emerges due to charge - resonance effect@xcite .",
    "this could complicate the hhg process .    in the present paper , using a sfa model that considers the coulomb effects",
    ", we investigate the hhg from a 1d model diatomic molecule with large @xmath4 ( @xmath5 a.u . ) .",
    "the sfa model calculation gives the hhg spectrum qualitatively consistent with the numerical result and shows the pronounced hump and dip structure in the plateau region .",
    "detailed analysis shows that two - center interference as well as the interference between different recombination electron trajectories are responsible for the enhanced or suppressed harmonic yield at a certain order . and",
    "in particular , the location of the unusual structure is found to be sensitive to the laser intensity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , we present our analytical theory . in sec.iii , we apply our theory to the hhg from a 1d model diatomic molecule with large @xmath4 .",
    "we also analyze the complicated interference patterns here .",
    "sec.iv is our conclusion .",
    "in ref.@xcite , we have developed a sfa model for the hhg from symmetric diatomic molecules , emphasizing the influence of the charge - resonance states that are strongly coupled to electromagnetic fields for the case of large @xmath4 .",
    "and we showed there that for sufficiently large internuclear distances , while initially the system is in the ground state , the contribution to the harmonic comes mostly from the continuum state - ground state transition . for very large @xmath4 with @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the ground state and the first excited state of the unperturbed system , respectively , the harmonic formula along the field direction",
    "can be written as @xmath10}{a}+\\frac{\\delta[(m+1+n){\\omega}-{\\omega}']}{b}\\bigg\\}j_{n}j_{m},\\\\ \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where@xmath11@xmath12 , @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 is the ionization potential of the ground state , @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 is the field amplitude , @xmath18 is the unit vector along the field direction , @xmath19 is the field frequency .",
    "( 1 ) is applicable for the large internuclear distance and the weak field as discussed in our previous paper . in the sfa@xcite",
    ", an important assumption is that electrons in the continuum states can be treated as a free particle moving in the electric field without considering the coulomb potential .",
    "accordingly , the continuum wave function @xmath20 is approximated by a plane wave @xmath21 with the energy @xmath22 , where the binding potential is completely omitted . here , we extend to consider the modification from the comloub potential , thus a better approximation of the continuum states in the following form is exploited , @xmath23 where the effective momentum @xmath24 , and the energy @xmath22 .",
    "this incorporates some effects of the binding potential through its dependence on @xmath15@xcite . with the rectification of eq .",
    "( 2 ) , the harmonic formula of eq . ( 1 ) can be rewritten as @xmath25}{a}+\\frac{\\delta[(m+1+n){\\omega}-{\\omega}']}{b}\\bigg\\}j_{n}j_{m},\\\\ \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for comparison with 1d numerical simulation , the model is simplified to an one dimensional model and the integral over the momentum is evaluated by the so - called pole approximation@xcite throughout this paper . by setting @xmath26 or @xmath27 , which denotes the energy conservation in the ionization process , one can obtain the momentum @xmath28 with certain @xmath29 .",
    "the two @xmath30 functions in eq .",
    "( 3 ) denote the emission of harmonics with certain @xmath29 and @xmath31 in the recombination process . from the above explicit expression , we conclude that the recombination electrons with diverse momenta could contribute to a common harmonic order , since the @xmath30 functions explicitly depend on the integer @xmath31 .",
    "this implies that , not only in the ionization process the electron can absorb @xmath32 photons , but also in the recombination process the electron can absorb ( positive ) or emit ( negative ) @xmath31 photons , which induces the final emission of @xmath33 photons .",
    "the integrand of eq .",
    "( 3 ) can be divided into several parts .",
    "the part of @xmath34 explicitly depends on the ionization energy @xmath35 and the internuclear distance @xmath4 , but is independent of the field parameters .",
    "it incorporates the interference effects between cores of the two - center molecules @xcite , and mainly is determined by the properties of the molecules .",
    "the part of @xmath36 explicitly depends on the field amplitude @xmath17 and the field frequency @xmath19 , representing the probability amplitude for an electron to absorb or emit @xmath37 photons .",
    "it reflects the interaction between the electron and the field and is closely related to the field parameters .",
    "thus , those recombination electrons that have the momenta satisfying the condition of @xmath26 or @xmath27 all could contribute to a harmonic order , and the weight of the contribution depends on not only two - center interference but also the interference between different recombination electron trajectories@xcite .",
    "the latter is strongly depends on the laser intensity , as a result , we expect that the interference structure in hhg spectra could rely on the field parameters .",
    "the above theoretical analysis is verified by our numerical simulations as shown in following .",
    "the hamiltonian of the 1d model diatomic molecule studied here is @xmath38=@xmath39@xmath40 @xmath41@xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the effective charge , @xmath4 is the internuclear separation , @xmath44 is the amplitude of the external electric field , and @xmath45 is the frequency of the external field . in the paper , we adopt the atomic units , @xmath46 .",
    "calculations have been performed for @xmath47 nm trapezoidally shaped laser pulses with a total duration of @xmath48 optical cycles and linear ramps of three optical cycles .",
    "numerically , the above schrdinger equation can be solved by the operator - splitting method@xcite .",
    "a typical result is presented in fig . 1 . here",
    "we plot the harmonic spectra of a 1d model diatomic molecule with @xmath49 , @xmath50 a.u . and @xmath51 a.u .",

    "in contrast , for the large internuclear distance cases as indicated by fig .",
    "1 , the harmonic spectra show some kind of hump or dip structure . especially as the field intensity increases , the hump structure become more pronounced around the 15th order harmonic in figs .",
    "1(b ) with @xmath56 , compared to that in figs .",
    "1(a ) with @xmath58 .",

    "according to the simple picture regarding the nuclei as point emitters proposed by lein @xmath3@xcite , for molecules with symmetric initial states , destructive interference ( minimum in the harmonic spectrum ) occurs when @xmath62 . here",
    "@xmath63 is the effective momentum of the electron , @xmath64 is the angle between the molecular axis and the laser polarization direction . constructive interference ( maximum in the harmonic spectrum ) occurs when @xmath65@xcite . in the 1d case , for @xmath66 a.u .",
    ", the first predicted minimum is at the 13th order harmonic , which agrees with that in figs .",
    "while in figs .",
    "2(b ) , the minimum shifts to the 17th order harmonic . for the large @xmath50 a.u . , the predicted minima are at the 8th order with @xmath67 , the 16th order with @xmath68 , and the 27th order with @xmath69 , etc .",
    "the maxima are at the 12th order with @xmath68 and the 21th order with @xmath69 , etc . while in the numerical cases , the pronounced minimum is at the 17th order in figs .",
    "1(a ) and the 23th order in figs .",
    "the pronounced maximum is at the 15th order in figs .",
    "1(b ) . from the above observations , we find that the interference patterns in the hhg usually depend on the laser intensity . moreover , for the large @xmath4 case",
    ", it becomes difficult for the simple point - emitters model to predict the interference patterns .    to illuminate the hump and dip structure in figs .",
    "1(b ) , we investigate the physical mechanism for the emission of a harmonic order from molecules with large @xmath4 . in fig .",
    "4 , using the same laser and molecule parameters as in figs .",
    "1(b ) , we plot the values of @xmath70 without considering the interference term eq .",
    "( 4 ) ( the red curves with the hollow symbol ) and @xmath71 with considering the interference term eq . ( 4 ) ( the black curves with the solid symbol ) as functions of the electron momentum @xmath28 for certain individual harmonic orders . here",
    "@xmath72 and @xmath73 and only the contributions from positive momenta are shown .",
    "for clarity , we use the dotted arrows to indicate those momenta , which correspond to the first several minimal extrema of @xmath74 in fig .",
    "the relevant momentum values are labelled above the arrows .",
    "we use the horizontal arrows in figs .",
    "4(a ) to indicate several maximal extrema of @xmath70 ( denoted as @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) .    from eq . ( 6 ) , the contributions to single peak of hhg consist of two parts , i.e. , the interference term @xmath74 and bessel function term @xmath70 . for the @xmath77 order harmonic at which the harmonic dip appears in figs .",
    "1(d ) , without considering the interference term @xmath74 , the primary contributions of @xmath70 come from those momenta around the values of @xmath78 a.u . and",
    "@xmath79 a.u .",
    "corresponding to two of the minimal extrema of @xmath74 , as indicated by the red curve with the hollow symbol in figs .",
    "when considering the interference term @xmath74 , the contributions from those momenta are strongly suppressed , as indicated by the black curve with the solid symbol in figs .",
    "4(a ) . in figs .",
    "4(a ) those momenta around the value of @xmath80 a.u . give positive and negative contributions to the amplitude of the @xmath81th order harmonic . because the positive and negative values will cancel each other so the sum of these contributions is small .",
    "for other harmonic orders , for example , the @xmath82th order , around which the harmonic hump appears in figs .",
    "1(d ) . the red curve with the hollow symbol in figs .",
    "4(b ) shows that the primary contributions of @xmath70 to the harmonic order come from those momenta around the value of @xmath80 a.u .",
    ", different from @xmath78 a.u . and @xmath79 a.u .",
    "of the @xmath81th order case . the black curve with the solid symbol in figs .",
    "4(b ) also shows that the suppression effect from the interference term @xmath74 is weaker than that of the @xmath81th order case .",
    "the above observations indicate that the interference term @xmath83 is mainly responsible for the formation of the hump and dip in figs .",
    "4 clearly shows that the formation of single order harmonic is closely related to the recombination electrons with many different momenta @xmath28 . the contribution from the recombination electron at one certain momentum @xmath28",
    "is weighted by the corresponding probability amplitude @xmath84 .",
    "in addition , from figs .",
    "4(a ) it can also be concluded that the interference minimum in the harmonic spectrum could appear at the harmonic order at which the primary contributions from the term @xmath70 are strongly suppressed due to the destructive interference from the term @xmath74 .",
    "since the probability amplitude @xmath71 depends on the field intensity , the position of the harmonic hump or dip depends on the intensity too .",
    "the interference patterns in hhg for molecules with large @xmath4 are much more complicated than that for molecules with small @xmath4 .",
    "the adjacent maximal and minimal extremum points of @xmath74 correspond to constructive and destructive interferences .",
    "they are so close as shown in fig .",
    "3 , that the constructive and destructive interference extrema in the plottings of @xmath71 could be entangled .",
    "this makes the interference effects on hhg very sensitive to the field intensity . in this case , the simple point - emitter model is not available .",
    "our model could provide a good description for the hhg of diatomic molecules even for the case of large internuclear separation .",
    "in conclusion , using a sfa model that considers coulomb potential modification on the continuum wavefunctions , we have analytically and numerically investigated the hhg from diatomic molecules with large internuclear separation .",
    "the harmonic spectra obtained by the sfa model agree with the numerical simulations .",
    "our model calculation reveals that the two - center interference as well as the interference between different recombination electron trajectories are responsible for the unusual enhanced or suppressed harmonic yield at a certain order , and these interference effects depend on the laser parameters such as intensity",
