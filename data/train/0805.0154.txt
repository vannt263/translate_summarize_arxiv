    "<S> we study the properties of tsallis entropy and shannon entropy from the point of view of algorithmic randomness . in algorithmic information theory , there are two equivalent ways to define the program - size complexity @xmath0 of a given finite binary string @xmath1 . in the standard way , @xmath0 is defined as the length of the shortest input string for the universal self - delimiting turing machine to output @xmath1 . in the other way , </S>",
    "<S> the so - called universal probability @xmath2 is introduced first , and then @xmath0 is defined as @xmath3 without reference to the concept of program - size . in this paper , we investigate the properties of the shannon entropy , the power sum , and the tsallis entropy of a universal probability by means of the notion of program - size complexity . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the convergence or divergence of each of these three quantities , and evaluate its degree of randomness if it converges . </S>"
