    "since quite a long time there exists a discrepancy between theoretical predictions and measurements of the quantity @xmath0 , which describes the average number of charm quarks in the final state of a b - hadron decay @xcite . in the last years this difference became smaller and it became a matter of taste whether one speaks of a missing charm puzzle or not . in this talk we try to summarize the theoretical results and to clarify the origin of different numbers for @xmath0 .",
    "+ one can calculate @xmath0 in the following ways : @xmath1 @xmath2 sums up all charmless decay rates like the non - leptonic channels @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and the semi - leptonic channels @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 sums up all decay rates with one charm quark in the final state , like the non - leptonic channels @xmath9 , @xmath10 and the semi - leptonic channels @xmath11 .",
    "finally we have @xmath12 with two charm quarks in the final state : @xmath13 . +",
    "before we compare experimental results and theoretical predictions , let us look at the calculation of these decay rates .",
    "the heavy quark expansion ( hqe ) ( for a recent review see @xcite ) is the theoretical framework to handle inclusive @xmath14-decays .",
    "it allows us to expand the decay rate in the following way @xmath15 here we have an systematic expansion in the small parameter @xmath16 .",
    "the different terms have the following physical interpretations :    * @xmath17 : the leading term is described by the decay of a free quark ( parton model ) , we have no non - perturbative corrections .",
    "* @xmath18 : in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ hqe ] ) we make an operator product expansion . from dimensional reasons",
    "we do not get an operator which would contribute to this order in the hqe .",
    "* @xmath19 : first non - perturbative corrections arise at the second order in the expansion due to the kinetic and the chromomagnetic operator .",
    "they can be regarded as the first terms in a non - relativistic expansion . *",
    "@xmath20 : in the third order we get the so - called weak annihilation and pauli interference diagrams . here",
    "the spectator quark is included for the first time .",
    "these diagrams give rise to different lifetimes for different @xmath14 hadrons . *",
    "the dots represent higher order terms in @xmath21 , possible non - perturbative @xmath22 corrections ( like in the decay @xmath23 @xcite ) and unknown terms which are due to duality violation ( see @xcite for a nice review ) .",
    "schematically one can write the @xmath24 s as products of perturbatively calculable functions ( depending on couplings , masses , renormalization scale , ... ) and matrix elements , which have to be determined by some non - perturbative methods like lattice - qcd or sum rules .",
    "+ now we may have a closer look at eq .",
    "( [ hqe ] ) .",
    "each of the appearing terms can be expanded in a power series in the strong coupling constant @xmath25 we start with a discussion of the perturbative part of the @xmath26 s and then we make some comments about the status of the non - perturbative parameters .      @xmath27 is well known .",
    "in addition we have analytic expressions of @xmath28 for @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath29 @xcite and a numerical value for @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the effects of the charm quark mass were found to be quite sizeable .",
    "although suppressed by one power of @xmath31 , penguin diagrams are dominant for @xmath32 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently the nlo calculation for @xmath33 has been finished @xcite . the inclusion of penguin diagrams with current - current operators for the decay @xmath30 and penguin diagrams with penguin operators for @xmath32 is still missing , but their effects are not expected to be large .",
    "it is a remarkable feature of the hqe that in the leading term @xmath17 only the unit operator appears , so the matrix elements of this operator are trivial .",
    "therefore we have no non - perturbative parameters in @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath34 is known for the most important operator insertions .",
    "some penguin operator insertions are still missing .",
    "it would be nice to have a result for @xmath35 , but the calculation seems to be quite tough .",
    "one has to calculate the imaginary part of three loop diagrams with one external gluon .",
    "here we have two matrix elements : @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the first one is not very well known , see e.g @xcite , while the second number can be extracted from experiment .",
    "spectator effects arise first in the third order of the expansion in @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath38 is known for @xmath39@xcite and for @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 with charm quark mass effects @xcite .",
    "@xmath43 was calculated for @xmath39 by @xcite .",
    "the calculation of @xmath43 for @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 is still missing . in @xmath20",
    "we have the following non - perturbative parameters : decay constants @xmath44 ( depending on the decaying meson @xmath45 ) and bag - barameters @xmath46 ( depeding on the decaying meson @xmath45 and the dirac structures @xmath47 of the appearing operators ) .",
    "for @xmath39 we have already quite stable lattice predictions for these quantities , while for @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 relieable numbers are still missing ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .      for @xmath39",
    "even @xmath50 has been calculated by @xcite ; this could be done for @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , too .",
    "the appearing matrix elements were estimated in vacuum insertion approximation .",
    "in order to determine @xmath0 we have to determine the branching ratios for @xmath51 decays into 0,1 and 2 charm quarks .",
    "so one could simply calculate @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "but there are several reasons , why it might be better not to calculate these quantities straightforward .",
    "+ first , the semi - leptonic decay rate @xmath54 is clearly the most reliable prediction , while @xmath55 is probably the least reliable prediction . by writing @xmath56",
    "we can eliminate @xmath55 in favor of @xmath54 .",
    "in @xmath57 we have no @xmath58- and @xmath59-dependence anymore .",
    "+ second , the decay @xmath60 is most sensitive to possible quark hadron duality violations .",
    "this is due to the fact that the hqe is actually not an expansion in @xmath21 , but in @xmath61 , where e is the energy release in the decay .",
    "for @xmath60 we have @xmath62 , which is already quite a small number .",
    "if we use eq .",
    "( 3 ) and the @xmath63 s instead of the branching ratios , we have eliminated the decay @xmath60 , as proposed in @xcite . now @xmath64 is an important input parameter for the determination of @xmath0 .",
    "possible enhancements of @xmath64 due to new physics would lower @xmath65 and @xmath66 simultaneously .",
    "different mechanisms for such an enhancement were studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "now we summarize the results for the relevant decay rates from the literature and determine @xmath0 in various ways .      the dominant decay is @xmath67 .",
    "there was quite a confusion due to two different numbers in the literature : ball et al .",
    "quote @xmath68@xcite , while neubert was showing @xmath69@xcite in jerusalem .",
    "the difference of these numbers is an effect of second order in @xmath31 . while the authors of @xcite were calculating ratios like @xmath70 nummerically , the author of @xcite expanded the ratio in @xmath31 @xcite . unfortunateley",
    "the difference is quite sizeable . for all possible semi - leptonic decays",
    "we get @xmath71 and for the cabibbo suppressed decay modes the result is @xmath72 . depending on our input for @xmath73",
    "we get two different results : @xmath74      for the non - leptonic charmless @xmath51-decays it turned out , that penguin diagrams are as important as the leading contribution to these decays , although being suppressed by @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "even @xmath75 contributions , so - called double penguins have a sizeable value @xcite .",
    "one gets @xmath76",
    "@xcite for all charmless final states .",
    "recently the nlo qcd calculation of @xmath77 and @xmath78 was finished @xcite .",
    "greub and liniger get an enhancement of more than @xmath79 compared to the lo value @xmath80 with the new result for @xmath77 and @xmath78 at hand we get : @xmath81      for @xmath30 we have again two different results .",
    "quote @xmath82 @xcite , while neubert gets @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "the difference has the same origin as in section 4.1 .      with the experimental value for the semi - leptonic branching ratio presented in osaka @xmath84 @xcite",
    ", we can determine @xmath0 in three different ways .",
    "1 .   elimination of no charm : @xmath85 2 .",
    "elimination of one charm : @xmath86 3 .",
    "elimination of two charm : @xmath87    for @xmath88 and @xmath89 we used the average of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "of course , all these numbers should be the same .",
    "the reason for the disagreement is found by comparing the theoretical and experimental value of the semi - leptonic branching ratio .",
    "theory tells us @xmath90 the central value is quite above the experimental number for @xmath91 , but the errors are large . when we introduced @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ rratio ] ) , we asummed that @xmath92 , which is not satisfied .",
    "this is the reason for the inconsistencies in the determination of @xmath0 .",
    "if we use @xmath93 to determine @xmath0 , we get in all three cases the central value @xmath94 . + in osaka @xmath95",
    "was given as the experimental value @xcite , while kagan gets a value of @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this talk to clarify the origin of these two different experimental numbers .",
    "in this talk we tried to clarify the orgin of different values for @xmath0 on the market .",
    "first we have different numbers for @xmath88 and @xmath89 due to a different treatment of @xmath97 contributions .",
    "the numbers of @xcite give a slightly smaller value for @xmath0 , than the numbers of @xcite .",
    "second , we get quite different results for the three possibilities ( eq .",
    "( 1)-(3 ) ) to determine @xmath0 , if we use a normalization of the decay rates to @xmath54 instead of @xmath55 we have the same situation , that we get quite different numbers for different normalizations ( see talk @xcite ) . ] .",
    "the reason for that is the disagreement of the theoretical number for @xmath91 with the experimental value .",
    "this problem has to be resolved in the future .",
    "third , the experimental value of @xmath0 seems to be not completely clear .",
    "so we are still not in the position to say the final word about the existence of a missing charm puzzle .",
    "if we use an appropriate theoretical input and set @xmath98 ( which means a high value for @xmath31 ) and @xmath99 is fixed by hqet .",
    "] , than experiment ( the numbers shown in osaka ) and theory agree more or less . on the other hand",
    "there is still room for a deviation , which might be due to a new physics enhanced @xmath100 or dualtity violation in @xmath30 or .... precise experimental values of @xmath101 and @xmath64 would help a lot , to confirm or to rule out these interesting possibilities .",
