    "it is a prediction of the hierarchical clustering scenario , borne out by n - body simulations , that dark matter halos are triaxial ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) . to be sure , baryons will alter the shapes of halos , presumably making them more spherical @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , halo triaxiality is expected to be a feature of our universe if structure formation proceeds according to the standard model .",
    "unfortunately , the shapes of dark matter halos are extremely difficult to determine by direct observations .    tidal debris from the milky way",
    "s satellite galaxies provide a potentially powerful probe of the galactic gravitational potential with the tidal stream from the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( sgr dsph ) the most prominent example . in the years following the discovery of the sgr dsph @xcite numerous surveys",
    "have produced an all - sky panorama of the sgr system ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the observed positions and velocities of stars in the stream are compared with theoretical predictions for a range of triaxial halo models .",
    "the underlying assumption is that the kinematics of the stream is determined primarily by the galactic potential , and only to a lesser extent , by the structure of the progenitor .",
    "examples of studies that attempted to use the sgr system in this way include @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented an all - sky map of the sgr system in m - giant stars in which candidate sgr stars were selected from the 2mass catalog using their color , magnitude , and angular position .",
    "the result was a kinematic snapshot of both leading and trailing streams .",
    "@xcite provided a more refined map of the stream using the sdss . recently",
    "@xcite and @xcite ( hereafter lmj09 and lm10 , respectively ) used both of these data sets to argue that the milky way s halo is triaxial .",
    "lmj09 compared single particle orbits to the projected positions of the sdss fields and radial velocities of the m giants .",
    "their best - fit model has isopotential axis ratios of @xmath2 and @xmath3 with the halo s intermediate axis pointing toward the north galactic pole and its minor axis roughly aligned with the line that connects the sun and the galactic centre ( gc ) .",
    "lm10 carried out a similar analysis , but modeled sagittarius as an n - body system rather than a single particle .",
    "their favored halo model is nearly oblate with @xmath4 where again the minor axis of the halo lies in the disk plane nearly along the sun - gc line .",
    "the lmj09 and lm10 results present a challenge for the standard cold dark matter model of structure formation . in general , a halo s gravitational potential will be more spherical than its mass distribution ; the isodensity and isopotential axis ratios of an axisymmetric system ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively ) roughly satisfy the relation @xmath7 , at least in the outer parts of the halo @xcite .",
    "thus , the mass distribution that corresponds to the lm10 potential is approximately oblate with axis ratios @xmath8 . since the formation of the galactic disk",
    "is expected to make the halo more symmetric in the disk plane the axis ratios of the proto - galaxy are likely even larger .",
    "@xcite presented a comprehensive analysis of dark halo shapes based on high - resolution dissipationless simulations .",
    "they found that the mean major - to - minor isodensity axis ratio for galaxy - sized halos was @xmath9 with a dispersion of @xmath10 .",
    "moreover their halos , and those of earlier studies , tended more toward prolate - triaxial than oblate - triaxial ( that is triaxial with one axis significantly smaller than the other two ) .",
    "the effect baryons have on a halo s shape was studied by @xcite and others . in general baryons",
    "tend to make the halos more spherical , particularly in the innermost regions",
    ". the axis ratios of the proto - galaxy should therefore be even larger than those observed today .",
    "the implication is that the galactic halo favoured by the lmj09 and lm10 analyses is an outlier within the context of the standard cosmological paradigm .",
    "a secondary issue concerns the shapes of the isodensity contours themselves . lmj09 and lm10 assume triaxial isopotential contours , which imply peanut - shaped isodensity contours ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "by contrast , triaxiality in simulations is almost always measured in terms of the density and peanut - shaped contours are rarely seen .",
    "these considerations motivated us to reexamine constraints on the dark halo from the sgr stream .",
    "we carry out the modeling exercise within the bayesian statistical framework and are therefore able to calculate the probability distribution function ( pdf ) for the structural parameters of the halo and quantify the model uncertainties .",
    "previous analyses focused on the shape parameters of the halo ( the axis ratios and the euler angles that define the halo s orientation ) .",
    "the general practice has been to fix the structural parameters of the bulge , disk , and spherically - averaged halo and allow the halo shape parameters to vary while trying to fit kinematic data for stars along the sgr stream .",
    "typically , only the most rudimentary constraints on the galaxy s structure are included .",
    "for example , in the lmj09 and lm10 analyses ( see , also @xcite ) the model is designed so that the circular speed at the position of the sun is @xmath11 . as discussed below",
    ", the disk and bulge in this model appear to be too large ( by factors of 2 - 3 ) to be consistent with a number of observational constraints .",
    "in this paper , we consider a general disk - bulge - halo model for the milky way and allow the key structural parameters for all three components to vary simultaneously .",
    "the likelihood function includes not only the stream constraints , but observational constraints from the line - of - sight velocity dispersion ( losvd ) and surface brightness profiles for the bulge , the vertical force and surface density in the solar neighborhood , the oort constants , the circular speed curve , and the mass at large galactocentric radii .    at first glance",
    ", our parameter space has expanded to an unwieldy level .",
    "( our model has twenty - eight free parameters ! ) .",
    "however , by using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm we are able to efficiently estimate the pdf for the full multi - dimensional parameter space . in this paper , we employ the affine - invariant stretch - move ensemble sampler of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "since our mcmc analysis requires a large number of `` likelihood calls '' we are precluded from modeling sgr as a full n - body system .",
    "we therefore follow lmj09 and model sgr and the associated tidal stream as a single particle that orbits in the fixed gravitational potential of the milky way .",
    "the stream likelihood function is calculated by comparing the phase space coordinates from the m giant and sdss observations ( namely , the angular positions and line - of - sight velocities ) with points along model orbits .    in section 2 we use bayesian inference and our mcmc algorithm to reanalyze the m giant and sdss data within the context of the galactic model from lmj09 and lm10 .",
    "we also consider an alternative model in which the isodensity contours ( rather than isopotential contours ) of the halo are triaxial . in section 3",
    "we introduce a more general model for the density - potential pair of the galaxy as well as the observational constraints that enter our analysis .",
    "we present our main results in section 4 .",
    "our analysis points to a similarly triaxial model as the one found in lm10 though the disk - halo decomposition of the mass distribution is quite different .",
    "we conclude in section 5 with a summary of our key results .",
    "we begin this section with brief summaries of the galactic model used in lmj09 and lm10 , the observational constraints from the sgr stream , and the affine - invariant ensemble sampler deployed in our analysis . we then present results from two separate mcmc runs .",
    "the first closely follows lmj09 in that the isopotential contours are assumed to be triaxial ellipsoids and certain model parameters , namely the present - day distance to the sgr dsph and the thickness and intrinsic dispersion of the stream are kept fixed . in the second run , the isodensity contours are assumed to be triaxial and the aforementioned parameters are allowed to vary .",
    "the galactic model used by lmj09 and lm10 comprises a hernquist bulge @xcite , a miyamoto - nagai disk @xcite , and a logarithmic halo ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the contributions to the gravitational potential for each of these components are given by @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the usual right - handed cartesian coordinates with the @xmath16-axis oriented along the symmetry axis of the disk and the sun located on the @xmath17-axis , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "we also define a triaxial coordinate system for the halo with coordinates @xmath20 .",
    "following lmj09 , we fix the @xmath21-axis to be along the symmetry axis of the disk and write @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 in this section , we follow lmj09 ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) and fix the structural parameters of the disk , bulge , and halo potentials to the following values : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 . the halo scale velocity , @xmath31 ,",
    "is adjusted so that the local circular speed is @xmath32 .",
    "we refer to this model as the ljm model .",
    "the sgr system roughly lies in a single plane , which has been identified as the orbital plane of the sgr dsph . to a good approximation ,",
    "this plane contains the sun and is defined by the orbital pole @xmath33 ( lm10 and @xcite ) .",
    "the sgr dsph itself is located at @xmath34 .",
    "@xcite found that the stars observed in the central regions of the sgr dsph have a mean radial velocity of @xmath35 , which is nearly the same as the radial velocity of m54 , a globular cluster usually identified with the center of the sgr dsph .",
    "note that this velocity has been converted to the galactic standard of rest ( gsr ) , a reference frame centered on the sun but at rest relative to the galactic center .",
    "the conversion from heliocentric velocities to the gsr depends on the circular speed at the position of the sun and the sun s peculiar velocity @xmath36 . in @xcite as well as",
    "lmj09 and lm10 , the circular speed of the sun is assumed to be @xmath37 .",
    "we return to this assumption in section 3 .",
    "the heliocentric proper motion of the sgr dsph has been measured by @xcite using archival hubble space telescope ( hst ) data as @xmath38 .",
    "the heliocentric distance to the sgr dsph @xmath39 has been estimated by a various methods and is found to lie in the range from @xmath40 ( see table 2 of @xcite ) .      for simplicity we use the so - called sagittarius spherical coordinate system @xmath41 defined by @xcite where @xmath42 is the heliocentric radial coordinate and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are angular coordinates .",
    "the sgr dsph is located at @xmath45 while the stream approximately follows the @xmath46 great circle with @xmath43 increasing along the trailing portion of the stream and @xmath44 increasing toward the orbital pole . following lmj09",
    ", we assume that the sgr dsph can be modeled as a point mass and that the leading and trailing portions of the stream follow , respectively , the future and past segments of its orbit .",
    "the model orbit is then compared with the radial velocity and angular position measurements of m giants from @xcite and the angular position measurements from the sdss study of @xcite .",
    "this method ignores the internal structure and dynamical evolution of the progenitor and stream .",
    "n - body simulations allow one to explore these effects but their use is unfeasible in the present analysis where 500k likelihood calls are required .",
    "( see however @xcite who discuss a promising approach in which a family of kinematic orbits are used to model the `` thick '' tidal stream . )    for the `` ith '' data point , we determine the position along the orbit with the same @xmath47 and , in so doing , arrive at model predictions for the line - of - sight velocity @xmath48 and the angular position @xmath49 .",
    "the likelihood function , or equivalently , the probability of the data given the model @xmath50 , is then @xmath51 }    \\nonumber \\\\   & \\times&\\prod_{i=1}^{n_v } \\frac{1}{\\left ( 2\\pi\\right ) ^{1/2}\\sigma_{v , i } } \\exp{\\left [ - \\frac{\\left ( v_{m}\\left ( \\lambda_i\\right ) -v_i\\right ) ^2 } { 2\\sigma_{v , i}^2}\\right ] } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term on the right - hand side involves a product over all m giants in the @xcite data set as well as the sdss sgr stream fields from @xcite whereas the second term involves only the m giants . the parameters @xmath52 are meant to account for both observational uncertainties and the intrinsic thickness of the sgr stream .",
    "likewise , the @xmath53 are meant to account for observational uncertainties in the line - of - sight velocity and the intrinsic dispersion .",
    "our aim is to calculate the posterior probability function ( pdf ) of the model , which is given by baye s theorem , @xmath54 where @xmath55 represents prior information and @xmath56 is the prior probability on the model m. the term @xmath57 , often referred to as the evidence , is essentially a normalization factor and does not enter our calculations .    in general , @xmath50 is specified by @xmath58 parameters and therefore @xmath59 is an @xmath58-dimensional function . in order",
    "to efficiently map this multi - dimensional function we use the stretch - move ( sm ) mcmc algorithm from @xcite .",
    "all mcmc algorithms require a proposal distribution or sampler to generate the chain of points in parameter space .",
    "if the different model parameters have different scales or are strongly correlated , then it can be extremely difficult to choose an effective sampler .",
    "and a poorly chosen sampler leads to poor convergence of the chain .",
    "the sm - mcmc algorithm employs an ensemble of @xmath60 `` walkers '' where @xmath61 .",
    "the proposal distribution for a given walker is determined by the other walkers ( rather than by the user ) . by design , the algorithm is invariant under linear re - parameterizations of the model parameters ( i.e. , affine invariant ) and the difficulties of choosing a sampler are avoided .",
    "we next reexamine the @xcite and @xcite data sets within the context of the galactic model described above and model assumptions that are similar to those used in lmj09 .",
    "the free parameters are the axis ratios @xmath62 and @xmath63 , the angular position @xmath64 of the @xmath65-axis in the @xmath66 plane and the two proper motion components of the sgr dsph . following lmj09 , we fix @xmath67 and line - of - sight velocity for the sgr dsph to be @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( gsr ) , respectively .",
    "we also follow lmj09 and set @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we assume uniform priors in @xmath72 and @xmath73 since the axis ratios @xmath74 and @xmath75 are effectively equivalent . to avoid degeneracies ,",
    "we restrict @xmath76 to be greater than unity .",
    "the prior for @xmath64 is assumed to be uniform between @xmath77 and @xmath78 . finally , we assume that the prior probability on the components of the proper motion are uniform across a range that includes both the best - fit values from lm10 and values observed by @xcite .",
    "we fit the stream using our sm - mcmc algorithm with 100 walkers and 5000 steps . here and throughout this work we discard the first 1000 steps , i.e. , the burn - in segment of the chain .",
    "the marginalized pdfs for @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath64 in this run ( referred to as the triaxial potential or tp run ) are shown in figure 1 while a summary is provided in table 1 .",
    "interestingly , the most likely shape from the bayesian analysis is closer to the results of lm10 than the results from lmj09 .",
    "the implication is that the parameter search algorithm is at least as important as whether the sgr dsph is modeled as an n - body system or a point particle .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in figure [ fig : bulgedisp ] we show the losvd measurements from @xcite and the inferred values from the model .",
    "our model does a good job in matching the general value for the dispersion profile though the data show a clear peak at 200 pc and decline for larger radii whereas the model dispersion profile is relatively flat .",
    "the implication is that the simple srsic - prugniel & simion model may be inadequate for the inner - most regions of the bulge .",
    "we see that the ljm model predicts losvd s that are 1.5 - 2 times higher than the measured velocities , which implies that their bulge mass is 2 - 4 times to high .",
    "the surface brightness toward the bulge is shown in figure [ fig : bulgesb ] .",
    "both our model and the ljm model do an acceptable job in fitting the data .",
    "the inner rotation curve is shown in figure [ fig : innervel ] and again , an acceptable fit is obtained .",
    "note that the ljm prediction rises more steeply at small @xmath81 as compared with our model and reaches a peak circular speed that is higher by a factor of 1.5 .",
    "we show the outer rotation curve in figure [ fig : outervel ] .",
    "in contrast with the inner regions of the galaxy , the ljm model and ours have a very similar shape . this point is further illustrated in figure [ fig : rotcurve ] where we show the full circular speed curve across a wide range in radii . for comparison",
    ", we also show the @xcite rotation curve , though this data was not used in our analysis . the ljm model and ours yield remarkably similar circular speed curves even though the bulge - disk - halo decomposition of @xmath82 is very different .",
    "we note that the peak contribution to @xmath82 from the bulge is nearly twice that for our best - fit model , a result echoed in figure [ fig : bulgedisp ] the peak contribution to @xmath82 from the disk is roughly the same in the ljm model as in our best - fit model , though in the ljm model , the peak occurs at r=10 kpc whereas in ours , it occurs at about 5 - 6 kpc . recall that for an exponential disk , the peak in @xmath82 is at 2.2 disk scale lengths , so the implication is that the ljm disk has an effective scale length of   5 kpc , which is roughly a factor of two larger than the standard values for the milky way .      in figure",
    "[ fig : streamfit ] we show the angular position @xmath44 and heliocentric velocity @xmath83 of stars that are presumed to be members of the sgr stream .",
    "a few comments are in order .",
    "first , the m - giant data is considerably noisier than the sdss fields though the latter only covers a portion of the leading arm of the sgr stream . in table 2 ,",
    "the stream - thickness ( or noise ) parameters are @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the analysis accounts for the intrinsic scatter in the m - giant data by choosing a larger noise parameter .",
    "this choice has the effect of reducing the weight the individual m - giant data points as compared with the sdss fields in the likelihood calculation .",
    "the pdfs for @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath64 are shown in figure [ fig : streamshape ] .",
    "the inferred shape is still roughly oblate with the short axis nearly aligned with the sun - gc line .",
    "in fact , the preferred model is more strongly aspherical ; the best - fit values for @xmath86 and @xmath87 are even larger than were found in the analysis presented in section 2 .",
    "note however that the uncertainties in these values is larger than before .",
    "regardless of the model or the suite of constraints , the sagittarius stream consistently points to a halo model that is oblate - triaxial with the short axis of the halo approximately coincident with the sun - gc line .",
    "what properties of the sgr stream drive the fit of the halo in this direction ? in figure",
    "[ fig : haloalign ] we show the isodensity contours for the total milky way model in the @xmath88 plane . also shown",
    "are the principle axes of the halo projected on to this plane . finally , we show positions of the m giant and sdss fields along the stream . roughly speaking , the stream ( and presumably , the orbit of the sgr dsph ) are elongated parallel to the plane of the disk . in general ,",
    "if isopotential surfaces in a particular plane are ellipses , then at least some of the particle orbits in that plane will be elongated perpendicular to the long axis of the potential .",
    "thus , current observations of the sgr stream may require a halo that is elongated perpendicular to the plane of the galactic disk , as found in lmj09 , lm10 and in the present work .",
    "the sgr stream inhabits the region of the galaxy between 20 - 60 kpc , which is roughly where the gravitational potential transitions from disk - dominated to halo - dominated .",
    "the stream therefore has the potential to help break the disk - halo degeneracy and constrain the mass distribution beyond the disk . to explore this point ,",
    "we re - analyze the model without the sgr stream constraint .",
    "the result for the cumulative mass profile is shown in figure [ fig : massprofiles ] .",
    "we see that uncertainties in the mass at @xmath89 kpc are reduced from 0.3 dex to 0.1 dex by including the sgr stream , .",
    "as noted above , and illustrated in figure [ fig : massprofiles ] , the mass distribution for our model and for the ljm model are very similar though the mass decomposition are very different .",
    "in particular , the disk and bulge masses for our model are lower in our models by factor of 2 - 4 .",
    "we have performed a bayesian analysis designed to model milky way that incorporates data for the sgr stream together with a broader suite of observational constraints .",
    "our analysis allows us to not only infer the shape of the dark matter halo , but also its spherically - averaged mass distribution .",
    "we find that our bayesian approach , which uses single - particle orbits , yields results for the shape parameters of the halo that are consistent with the n - body - based approach of lm10 .",
    "moreover , the sgr stream reduces the uncertainty in the milky way mass profile by a factor of @xmath90 .",
    "our analysis has not resolved the central question posed by lmj09 and lm10 : why does the sgr stream appear to favour such a strongly triaxial halo ? as discussed in the introduction , triaxial halo models favoured by lmj09 , lm10 , and this work are outliers in the distribution of halo shapes predicted by the standard @xmath91-cdm cosmology . while the galactic halo may indeed have this shape , we caution the reader that these analyses make use of a single stream .",
    "one should be suspicious that the halo model shares the same approximate orientation as the orbital plane of the sgr stream .    in principle",
    ", the use of multiple stellar streams with different orbital planes can improve the situation .",
    "indeed , the gd-1 , orphan , and monoceros streams have been already been extensively studied and , in some cases , used to constrain milky way models ( see , for example @xcite ) . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the gd-1 stream is a particular attractive feature since it is extremely narrow and therefore has a simple internal structure as compared with the sgr stream .",
    "however , the gd-1 and orphan streams cover a significantly smaller angular extent than the sgr stream and therefore may have limited value in constraining the potential .",
    "the tidal debris of satellite galaxies may , in fact , provide other less direct clues about halo triaxiality .",
    "n - body simulations by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) suggest that the morphology of tidal debris depends on the shape of the host galaxy s halo and in particular , the degree to which it departs from spherical symmetry .",
    "the results presented in this work and in lmj09 and lm10 provide a tantilizing , if not unsettling picture of the galactic halo .",
    "clearly , further analysis and more data are required to establish what the shape of the dark halo is .",
    "advances will likely come from a combination of improved modelling techniques , detailed n - body simulations and new data from the the next generation of surveys , such as gaia @xcite and lsst @xcite .",
