    "there are also subtleties related to the continuous deformations of paths in minkowski space - time , which is argued in the refs .   to be as unconnected as a space can be with respect to a path - topology , making the meaning of the derivatives unclear .",
    "handling these problems will require a deep understanding of what causes them .",
    "the different objects in the eq .",
    "( [ eq : mm_general ] ) hint that the divergence and derivative definition problems either originate from the contours themselves or from the gauge fields defined on these contours .",
    "consider for a moment a rectangular closed contour .",
    "topologically , this contour is identical to @xmath42 , thus although the original contour contains cusps they do not form any obstructions from a purely topological point of view .",
    "the problems with the cusps arise when considering derivatives , what means that one has assumed extra structure on the contours such as embedding them in another space ( minkowski , euclidean ) , a parametrization , a metric / gauge field . from the physical point of view , something happened at the cusp , a particle gets scattered , implying that we shall need to introduce something ( like a vertex function or an operator ) to take this into account when studying the contractions of the gauge fields belonging to opposite sides of our rectangular example .",
    "inspired by the example we split up our investigation of the mm equations into the study of the topological classes of the contours and of the extra structure generated by the gauge fields , the embeddings , etc .",
    "the topology of the contours has lead us to the knot theory , which is able to provide the consistent treatments of the different classes of contours and their properties ( group operations , linking , etc . ) .",

    "the complexified and compactified space - time is considered to be generated from the twistor space .",
    "the advantage of the twistor theory is that the differential data are exchanged for the algebraic data . moreover ,",

    "problems with the behavior of the wilson lines / loops at infinity drive us to consider alternatives to the usually applied one - point compactification of the space - time . for instance , the sign difference caused by the oppositely directed wilson lines in the tmds for the drell - yan and semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering processes might suggest that , from the point of view of the compactification , the point at @xmath44 is not the same as the point at @xmath45 .",
    "given the above motivation , it seems attractive to look into the finite - universe topologies , which have recently been investigated in the light of cmb data@xcite .    in the present work we followed another , more simple , strategy .",
    "we made use of the observation that in the large-@xmath8 limit , in the null - plane , for the light - like dimensionally regularized ( not renormalized ) wilson rectangles , the area differentials can be reduced to the normal ones .",
    "the area differential equations ( which can be treated as the non - renormalizable relatives of the mm eqs . ) in the coordinate representation show up the duality to the energy ( or rapidity , e.g. , in the tmd case ) evolution equations for the light - like wilson polygons in the momentum picture . as the result , the obtained differential energy / area equations form a closed set of the dynamical equations for the loop functionals ,",
    "they can be , in principle , formulated consistently and even solved on the light - cone .",
    "hence we made some progress in understanding of the relationship between the geometrical properties of the loop space in terms of the area differential evolution equations , , from one side , and the dynamics accumulated in the cusps  the angles between the light - like straight lines , from another side .",
    "thus , in the loop space , the ( external ) dynamics can be taken into account by introducing the obstructions to the initially smooth loops , with those obstructions resembling the _ sources _ within the schwinger field - theoretical picture .",
    "we have demonstrated that the universal schwinger quantum dynamical principle is a useful tool to study some special classes of the elements of the loop space , in particular , the cusped wilson exponentials ( null - polygons ) on the light - cone .",
    "more involved cases , e.g. , the non - light - like wilson polygons and polyhedra deserve separate study@xcite .",
    "we thank the participants of the jlab qcd evolution workshop and of the summer meetings in ect * , trento , for useful discussions .",
