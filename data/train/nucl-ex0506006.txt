    "measurements of nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments provide valuable insights into the nuclear structure based on the intriguing interplay of single particle and collective degrees of freedom . in particular ,",
    "nuclei in the @xmath12- and @xmath13-shell model space have recently received considerable attention through many new experiments inspired by the unique possibility to compare extensive data with results from large - scale shell model calculations .",
    "this progress is also related with the observation that general features of the nuclear medium can be studied in lighter nuclei as well .",
    "for instance , superdeformation which had been exclusively investigated for a long time on nuclei in the rare earth mass region and beyond @xcite has recently been observed in @xmath14ar @xcite , @xmath15ca @xcite , @xmath16zn @xcite and @xmath17zn @xcite .",
    "the obvious advantage in all these cases is the possibility to directly compare data with structure calculations based on highly developed nuclear shell model codes thus providing new features of this phenomenon and collectivity in general on a microscopic non - phenomenological level .",
    "+    in the same context measurements of @xmath0 factors and b(e2 ) values have been carried out for even - a zn isotopes with @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "two sets of large - scale shell model calculations were applied , based either on a @xmath15ca core and an @xmath13-shell model space or a @xmath7ni core and an @xmath19-shell configuration space with the inclusion of the @xmath3 orbital ; the latter was considered to be particularly important for the heavier zn isotopes . in these measurements",
    "coulomb excitation of 160 mev zn projectiles was achieved in collisions with a carbon target employing inverse kinematics . at this beam energy",
    "essentially the first @xmath20 states were strongly excited whereas higher - lying states were only weakly populated .",
    "+ this deficiency was overcome in a succeeding experiment aiming at higher excitation energies of both @xmath21zn and @xmath2zn by increasing the projectile energies to 180 mev close to the coulomb barrier @xcite . in these new measurements",
    "the @xmath0 factors and the b(e2 ) values of the now accessible @xmath1 states were determined for the first time . whereas the g(@xmath1 ) value of @xmath21zn was found to be consistent with predictions of both the collective and the spherical shell model , the value for @xmath2zn of g(@xmath1 ) = @xmath22 turned out to be in severe conflict with both model predictions .",
    "the negative sign of the @xmath0 factor was a clear indication for a dominant @xmath3 neutron component in the wave function , whereby the schmidt value is @xmath23 which , however , was not verified by the calculations .",
    "on the other hand , the newly determined b(e2 ) values were very well explained by these shell model calculations based on a @xmath7ni core plus @xmath3 neutrons .",
    "evidently , in this case the explicit inclusion of the @xmath3 orbital seems to be crucial for @xmath2zn , as the alternative calculations , assuming an inert @xmath15ca core but excluding the @xmath3 orbital , underestimate the experimental e2 strength .    in order to set the @xmath0 factor result of the @xmath2zn(@xmath1 ) state on more solid grounds new measurements have been performed . as emphasized in  @xcite such an effort",
    "is required as in the previous measurements the energy resolution of the nai(tl ) scintillators used for @xmath24 detection did not allow to fully separate the relevant ( @xmath25 ) @xmath24 line from a neighbouring ( @xmath26 ) 1261 kev line . as the latter was also strongly doppler - shifted due to the short nuclear lifetime , the separation of the two @xmath24 lines was particularly crucial for the detector pair placed in the forward hemisphere . on the other hand , estimates of an eventual admixture of the @xmath27 state to the measured precession of the @xmath1 state , based on the observed line intensities and the angular correlations of the corresponding @xmath24 transitions , could not explain the deduced @xmath0 factor , even under the assumption of a negative @xmath0 value for the @xmath27 state .",
    "in the present experiment a beam of isotopically pure @xmath2zn ions was accelerated to an energy of 180 mev at the munich tandem accelerator providing intensities of  20 @xmath28na on a multilayered target .",
    "the latter consisted of 0.44 mg/@xmath29 natural carbon deposited on a 3.34 mg/@xmath29 gd layer , which was evaporated on a 1.4 mg/@xmath29 ta foil , backed by a 4.49 mg/@xmath29 cu layer . between c and gd as well as between ta and cu thin layers of natural titanium ( @xmath30 mg/@xmath29 )",
    "provided good adherence being very crucial for the precession experiments .",
    "the same target had been used in former measurements under almost identical conditions @xcite .",
    "the target was cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature and magnetized to saturation by an external field of 0.06 t. the relevant level scheme of @xmath2zn for coulomb excitation is shown in fig",
    ". 1 @xcite .",
    "the excited zn nuclei move through the gd layer at mean velocities of @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) experiencing spin precessions in the transient field and are ultimately stopped in the hyperfine - interaction - free environment of the cu backing .",
    "the de - excitation @xmath24 rays were measured in coincidence with the forward scattered carbon ions detected in a 100 @xmath33 m si detector at @xmath34 .",
    "a 5 @xmath33 m thick ta foil between target and particle detector served as a beam stopper which , however , was transparent to the carbon recoils . as in the previous experiments the detector was operated at a very low bias of @xmath35 v to establish a thin depletion layer for separating the energies of carbon ions from those of light particles as protons and @xmath36 particles resulting from sub - coulomb fusion and transfer reactions . under these conditions",
    "very clean @xmath24-coincidence spectra were obtained .",
    "intrinsic ge detectors of @xmath37 relative efficiency were used for @xmath24 detection .",
    "2 shows a typical coincidence spectrum with emphasis on the ( @xmath25 ) @xmath24 line .",
    "evidently , all relevant @xmath24 lines were well resolved allowing a rigorous determination of their intensities required for the angular correlations as well as for the precessions of the nuclear states in question .",
    "particle-@xmath24 angular correlations @xmath38 have been measured for determining the slope @xmath39 = [ 1/w(@xmath40)]@xmath41[dw(@xmath40)/d@xmath40 ] in the rest frame of the @xmath24 emitting nuclei at @xmath43 = @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where the sensitivity to the precessions was optimal for all transitions of interest .",
    "precession angles , @xmath46 , were derived from counting - rate ratios r for up and down directions of the external magnetizing field which can be expressed as @xcite , @xmath47 where @xmath0 is the @xmath0 factor of the nuclear state and @xmath48 the transient field acting on the nucleus during the time interval @xmath49 ) which the ions spend in the gadolinium layer of the target ; the exponential accounts for nuclear decay with lifetime @xmath50 in the gd layer .",
    "simultaneously with the precessions the lifetimes of several excited states have been redetermined using the doppler - shift - attenuation - method ( dsam ) . for the analysis of the doppler - broadened lineshapes , which were observed with a ge detector placed at @xmath34 to the beam direction ,",
    "the computer code lineshape @xcite has been used .",
    "specific details of the analysis procedure are given in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 factors have been determined from the measured precession angles by calculating the effective transient field @xmath48 on the basis of the empirical linear parametrization ( see @xcite ) : @xmath51 with @xmath52 where the strength parameter @xmath53 @xcite , and @xmath54 is the attenuation factor accounting for the demagnetization of the gd layer induced by the zn beam ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the same scheme has been successfully applied in many former measurements .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tb : table2 ]    in order to study the importance of the @xmath3 orbit we have performed shell model calculations using @xmath7ni as closed shell core , with a model space defined by protons and neutrons occupying the single - particle orbitals @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath3 ( @xmath8 ) . to determine the effective interaction we use the recent charge - dependent potential model of machleidt , the so - called cd - bonn interaction @xcite .",
    "the final effective two - body interaction is obtained via many - body perturbation theory to third order , employing a renormalized nucleon - nucleon interaction defined for @xmath7ni as closed shell core and including folded - diagrams to infinite order . for details , see for example ref .",
    "a harmonic oscillator basis was used , with an oscillator energy determined via @xmath58 = 10.1 mev , a = 56 being the mass number . for the single - particle energies we employ values adapted from grawe in ref .",
    "@xcite , resulting in the energy differences @xmath59 mev , @xmath60 mev , @xmath61 mev for neutrons and @xmath62 mev , @xmath63 mev , @xmath61 mev for protons .",
    "the effective interaction has not been corrected for any eventual monopole changes .",
    "this means that the only parameters which enter our calculations are those defining the nucleon - nucleon interaction fitted to reproduce the scattering data , the experimental single - particle energies and the oscillator basis .",
    "furthermore , for the computation of the b(e2 ) s and @xmath0 factors , we have used unrenormalized magnetic moments and the canonical unrenormalized charges for protons and neutrons .",
    "the latter entails charges of @xmath64 and @xmath65 for protons and neutrons , respectively .",
    "the free - nucleon operator for the magnetic moment is defined as @xmath66 with @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "note , however , that the magnetic moment operator in finite nuclei is modified from the free - nucleon operator due to core - polarization and meson - exchange current ( mec ) corrections @xcite .",
    "the effective operator is defined as @xmath71 , \\ ] ] where @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 or @xmath75 , with @xmath76 the free - nucleon , single - particle @xmath77 factors ( @xmath78 ) and @xmath79 the calculated correction to it .",
    "note the presence of a new term @xmath80   $ ] , absent from the free - nucleon operator , which is a spherical harmonic of rank @xmath81 coupled to a spin operator to form a spherical tensor of multipolarity @xmath82 . in the calculations below we limit ourselves to a calculation with free operators only .",
    "an obvious modification of the latter is to use renormalized moments , as done in the recent work of ref .",
    "@xcite for nuclei in the @xmath83sn mass region .",
    "the results of the calculations for the energies of the low - lying excited states for both @xmath21zn and @xmath2zn in table  [ tb : table2 ] , while @xmath84 ) , @xmath85 ) and @xmath86 ) and the @xmath0 factors @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are presented and compared with the available data .",
    "two types of shell - model results are discussed and shown in this table , sm-1 and sm-2 . in sm-1",
    "we limit the number of neutrons which can be excited to the @xmath3 orbit to two , whereas sm-2 is the full shell - model calculation .",
    "the latter basis is , however , unnecessarily large since the results are converged with four neutrons at most in the @xmath3 orbit .",
    "one sees clearly that with at most two neutrons in the @xmath3 orbit the spectrum is rather poorly reproduced .",
    "however , even for the fully converged calculation the first excited @xmath90 state at 1.655 mev is badly reproduced ( @xmath91=2.406 mev ) , indicating most likely the need for particle - hole excitations , especially from the @xmath92 orbit .",
    "the typical occupation probabilities in the sm-2 calculation of the @xmath3 neutron single - particle orbit span from 2.2 to 2.4 .",
    "the @xmath56 neutron orbit has an average occupancy of 3.5 particles whereas the low - lying @xmath93 neutron orbit has occupancies around three .",
    "we note that for the @xmath94 , @xmath95 and the @xmath96 states there is a satisfactory agreement with the data",
    ".    for @xmath2zn the b(e2;2@xmath970@xmath98 ) exhibits a good agreement with data using unrenormalized effective charges while the b(e2;4@xmath98 @xmath992@xmath98 ) is overestimated .",
    "this could be ascribed to deficiencies in the two - body hamiltonian and/or omitted degrees of freedom in the model space .    for @xmath21zn",
    "we get 170.4 @xmath100@xmath101 for the b(e2;2@xmath970@xmath98 ) , to be compared with the experimental value of 307 @xmath100@xmath101 , hinting at the need of larger effective charges .",
    "this means in turn that particle - hole excitations involving the @xmath92 orbit may be more important for @xmath21zn than for @xmath2zn , in good agreement with previous shell model calculations including this degree of freedom ( see for example the discussions in refs .",
    "this is also reflected in the @xmath0 factors for @xmath21zn , which tend to be larger than the experimental values .",
    "if we , however , introduce effective magnetic moments by assuming a renormalization factor of @xmath102 for @xmath103 of protons and neutrons , we obtain @xmath0 factors closer to experiment .",
    "however , the @xmath92 orbit , if coupled with the @xmath56 orbit can yield a negative contribution to the @xmath0 factors .",
    "the latter analysis is obviously performed at the level of a simple two - body configuration ( see for example discussions in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , however , together with the @xmath104 configuration these are the only two - body configurations of interest here which can yield a negative @xmath0 factor . for @xmath21zn",
    "the occupancy of the @xmath3 orbit is less than one , and plays therefore a negligible role in the calculation of @xmath0 factors .",
    "since excitations from the @xmath7ni closed shell core are not included in the present model space , this reduction can not be accounted for .",
    "thus , the theoretical values should be larger than the experimental ones .    for @xmath2zn and its @xmath0 factors",
    "we note that for the @xmath20 states there is a fair agreement with data , confirming the previous shell - model analysis presented in refs .",
    "for @xmath89 we see that there is again a change from the calculation with only two neutrons in the @xmath3 orbit to the full calculation .",
    "this displays the role played by the @xmath3 orbit , which for the @xmath96 has an average occupation probability of 2.4 in the full sm-2 calculation , much larger than we have for @xmath21zn . for sm-1",
    "the corresponding occupation probability is 1.99 and this difference is clearly reflected in the change of @xmath89 from 0.066 to 0.008 demonstrating thereby the dominating role played by the @xmath104 admixture in the wave function .",
    "however , for sm-2 the @xmath0 factor although very small , is still positive . introducing effective magnetic moments with a scaling factor of @xmath105 reduces the theoretical sm-2 value to @xmath106 .",
    "we speculate again whether particle - hole excitations involving the @xmath92 orbit could yield further reductions and eventually a negative contribution .",
    "furthermore , another possibility is to include the effect of meson - exchange currents , as done in ref .",
    "meson - exchange current corrections arise because nucleons in nuclei are interacting through the exchange of mesons , which can be disturbed by the electromagnetic field . in terms of effective one - body operators",
    "this leads to a correction term @xmath80   $ ] in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) . in spite of these omitted degrees of freedom ,",
    "we see that our model space displays the important role played by the @xmath104 neutron configuration when going from the sm-1 to the full sm-2 shell - model calculation , lending thereby support to the experimental analysis .",
    "the role of the neutron @xmath107 orbit is also seen in the @xmath0 factors of low - lying @xmath108 states in odd @xmath109 isotopes with a large negative value , although smaller in absolute value than the corresponding schmidt value ( see ref .",
    "we have remeasured the @xmath0 factor of the @xmath1 state in @xmath2zn , with an improved energy resolution of the detectors used .",
    "the experimental value is @xmath10 consistent with our previous measurements .",
    "in addition , the accuracy of the @xmath0 factors of the @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 states has been improved and their lifetimes were well reproduced . the experimental results for @xmath21zn and @xmath2zn have been compared with large - scale shell model calculations using @xmath7ni as a closed shell core and a model space consisting of protons and neutrons occupying the @xmath8 single - particle orbits .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is rather good and the calculations reproduce well the experimental trends for the @xmath0 factors from @xmath21zn to @xmath2zn , although our theoretical approach is not capable of reproducing the negative sign of the @xmath110 value in @xmath2zn .",
    "this deficiency may be ascribed to particle - hole excitations , with the @xmath92 orbit playing a major role .",
    "the effect of meson - exchange currents may also play a role and will be investigated in future works , together with the inclusion of the @xmath92 orbit . in view of the present results similar measurements for the ge isotones @xmath111ge and @xmath112ge",
