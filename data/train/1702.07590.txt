    "<S> quality of individual photons and their ability to interfere is traditionally tested by measuring the hong - ou - mandel photon bunching effect . however , this phase insensitive measurement only tests the particle aspect of the quantum interference . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by these limitations , we formulate a witness capable of recognizing both the quality and the coherence of two photons from a single set of measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we exploit the conditional nonclassical squeezing which is sensitive to both the quality of the single photons and their indistinguishability and we show that it can be used to directly reveal both the particle and the wave aspects of the quantum interference . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we experimentally test the witness by applying it to a pair of independent single photons generated on demand </S>",
    "<S> .    quantum interference of individual photons is one of the fundamental keystones of quantum technology . </S>",
    "<S> the ability to recognize whether photons from different sources can interfere is therefore an important one . </S>",
    "<S> the basic tests use photon correlation measurements to ascertain presence of individual photons and two - photon bunching to verify their interference . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental test of the bunching effect traditionally employs the hong - ou - mandel interference @xcite , in which the two individual photons are mixed on a balanced beam splitter and the resulting two mode field is measured by a pair of photon counters . </S>",
    "<S> the bunching manifests as the lack of coincidence counts - if the coincidence probability is below one half , the interference effect is nonclassical , i.  e. incompatible with description using a mixture of classical waves or classical particles . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments for a wide range of experimental platforms safely observed low values of coincidence counts and thus demonstrated this fundamental nonclassical aspect @xcite .    for discrete variable quantum technology ( dv ) </S>",
    "<S> these features are sufficient . however , from the point of view of continuous variables ( cv ) and the more general framework of hybrid quantum technology @xcite , these experiments quantify only the particle nature of the interference and ignore the vacuum and the related phase sensitive aspects @xcite of the photon bunched state . </S>",
    "<S> the full picture of two - photon interference can be obtained by replacing the photon counters with homodyne detection and performing a full tomography @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reconstructed density matrix can then be analyzed in order to visualize and evaluate the interference caused by the the indistinguishability . </S>",
    "<S> the drawback to this tomographic approach is that it can not be used as a direct witness . </S>",
    "<S> the tomographic reconstruction is a process combining information from many incompatible measurements in order to obtain not directly measurable quantities , such as off - diagonal elements of the density matrix .    </S>",
    "<S> the elements of the reconstructed matrix contain , in principle , full information about the state . </S>",
    "<S> however , the information is practically limited due to unavailability of a complete set of measurement and the need to form prior assumptions about the suitable hilbert space of the system @xcite . for this reason some elements , in particular those related to higher fock numbers , are difficult to estimate with sufficient precision . </S>",
    "<S> this may lead to erroneous or indeterminate conclusions , such as attributing nonclassical properties to interference of classical signals . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , there are some phase sensitive photon correlation properties which can be used for construction of a direct witness not reliant on the tomographic approach .    </S>",
    "<S> two - photon interference leads to a state which , by suitably conditioning homodyne measurement , can be transformed into a state with quadrature squeezing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this squeezing , although not strong enough to be of much use on its own , can be created neither from classical light nor from non - interfering photons and is therefore an excellent witness of nonclassical and coherence properties . </S>",
    "<S> it can be also directly measured . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the measurement itself relies only on classical correlations within the state , without exploiting its entanglement @xcite or discord @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the general witness therefore requires one further condition - the phase of the initial states needs to be randomized . </S>",
    "<S> this step , while not affecting single photon states , cancels the possible false positives . </S>",
    "<S> the full _ phase sensitive hong - ou - mandel effect _ therefore serves as a directly observable witness simultaneously for both particle and wave - like aspects of the two photon interference . </S>",
    "<S> it also offers a new , much more challenging , benchmark against which new single photon sources can be tested .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the phase sensitive hong - ou - mandel effect as the witness for both high quality and high overlap of remotely prepared single photon states . </S>",
    "<S> the witness relies on observation of nonclassical quadrature correlations in a state created by interference of two single photons . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the witness to a pair of photons individually prepared in timing synchronization cavities @xcite , and we demonstrate both their high quality and coherence .    in the ideal version of the hong - ou - mandel experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the two single photons indistinguishable in all but a single degree of freedom are in the initial state @xmath0 and get mixed on a balanced beam splitter . </S>",
    "<S> this produces an entangled state @xmath1 with @xmath2 being the relative phase between the two output modes introduced by the beam splitter . </S>",
    "<S> the two resulting modes are then subjected to intensity measurements by avalanche photo diodes ( apds ) whose action is described by their povm elements @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which provide us with probabilities @xmath5 , @xmath6 . for indistinguishable photons there is a distinct lack of coincidences represented by @xmath7 on the other hand , for completely distinguishable photons the probability of coincident detection is firmly set to @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the full hong - ou - mandel measurement is realized by deliberately delaying one of the photons , thus increasing the distinguishability , and measuring the coincidence rates for these different settings . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is then quantified in terms of visibility , which is defined as @xmath9 where the maximization and minimization is performed over the set of different delays , and it is equal to one for perfectly indistinguishable single photons and zero for perfectly distinguishable ones . </S>",
    "<S> the visibility can be also reduced due to imperfection of the single photon states , caused by presence of vacuum or higher fock terms . however , since the vacuum terms do not contribute towards coincidence rates , only the higher fock terms lead to reduction in visibility . </S>",
    "<S> this means the hong - ou - mandel effect is a good indicator of distinguishability of single photons , but it provides a limited insight into their quality . </S>",
    "<S> another shortcoming of the hong - ou - mandel effect is related to the technological aspect of the employed single photon detectors . </S>",
    "<S> these particle detectors have a very broad detection spectrum incompatible with the much narrower spectrum of continuous homodyne detectors , which play crucial role in cv quantum information processing with light @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy can be removed by using optical filtering , but this comes with the cost of detection efficiency and alteration of the photon statistics . </S>",
    "<S> another issue is the fundamental identity of the single photon detectors as _ intensity _ detectors . as such </S>",
    "<S> , the measurement is insensitive to the vacuum and can not reveal the wave portion of the interference - the relative phase between the modes - related to the phase sensitive correlations between the field quadratures . as a consequence , with the particle detectors the state ( [ state_id ] ) can not be differentiated from a completely mixed state @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> needless to say , in cv and hybrid quantum information processing this distinction is quite crucial .    </S>",
    "<S> we are therefore looking for a strong unifying witness capable of verifying the quality of single photon states as well as their indistinguishability . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , we want a witness which employs high quality homodyne detectors in order to make it compatible with cv quantum information processing @xcite . and </S>",
    "<S> finally , we want to observe the interference effect directly , without the need to consider different measurement bases and settings , and subsequent reconstruction of the state s density matrix .        </S>",
    "<S> all of these requirements are reconciled in a three step procedure , in which the two single photon states are first phase randomized , then they interfere on a balanced beam splitter , and finally they are subjected to the joint measurement of phase - correlated quadrature operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 with @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 and @xmath16 obey canonical commutation relation @xmath17 = i$ ] . because of the phase insensitivity of initial single photon states , a common component of phases has no significance . </S>",
    "<S> hence , quadrature operators can be expressed only with the differential component @xmath18 as @xmath19 and @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> let us look at the ideal scenario with the state ( [ state_id ] ) and consider a homodyne measurement of mode 2 yielding a value @xmath21 </S>",
    "<S> . this measurement projects the state of the remaining mode 1 into a state proportional to @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> this state has zero mean values of the quadrature operators @xmath23 and @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the remarkable thing is that by choosing some particular values of @xmath21 , the state in mode 1 is projected into a squeezed state , whose second moment at a certain measurement angle shows a value less than @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the witness , confirming that state @xmath26 was obtained by interference of two phase insensitive single photon states on a balanced beam splitter , can be therefore formulated as @xmath27       = \\frac{\\mathrm{tr } [ x_1 ^ 2(\\delta \\theta)\\otimes|x_2\\rangle\\langle x_2| \\rho]}{\\mathrm{tr } [ 1\\otimes|x_2\\rangle\\langle x_2| \\rho ] }     < \\frac{1}{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 $ ] represents conditional mean value of an operator when condition @xmath29 is satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> the phase @xmath30 that gives minimum second moment is tied with the phase of superposition @xmath2 as @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> it is important that @xmath2 is arbitrarily controllable by classical phase locking , so @xmath30 is known _ a priori _ and can be set to an arbitrary value . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure therefore requires only a single set of measurements , avoids any need for reconstruction , and ( [ directwitness ] ) is a direct witness for both the indistinguishability and quality of single photons . </S>",
    "<S> the conditioning on @xmath21 is related to the generalized theory of squeezing extraction presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , but there are some interesting distinctions . due to the ideally vanishing nature of the first moments , the condition can be specified with help of the second _ noncentral _ moment which makes it unsatisfiable by a lone single photon @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to observing squeezing of the conditional central moment , the variance , which can be achieved even for a single photon interacting with the vacuum and may therefore lead to false positives . </S>",
    "<S> however , the conditional squeezing can be considered as a witness for quality of _ single _ photons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , an imperfect single photon state represented by density operator @xmath32 can be confirmed as nonclassical for an arbitrary positive value of @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the method demonstrates phase - sensitive continuous variable nature of the correlations in photon anti - correlation experiments . </S>",
    "<S> it is also interesting to point out that when the squeezing is replaced by another nonclassicality witness employing only single quadrature measurement , such as one proposed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , no conditional nonclassicality can be detected .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental setup for the test of the phase - sensitive hong - ou - mandel effect for two single photon states is based on our former experiment reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and it is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_expsetup ] . </S>",
    "<S> each of the two photon sources is based on the heralded scheme with parametric down conversion contained in an optical cavity . </S>",
    "<S> photon pairs are generated from the continuous - wave pump light at 430  nm at random times . </S>",
    "<S> one photon of the pair immediately leaves the cavity and is detected by an avalanche photodiode , thus heralding presence of another 860  nm photon stored in the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> a technique involving concatenated shutter cavity @xcite can be then used to release the second photon at a desired time . </S>",
    "<S> this allows timing synchronization of the two generated photons and enables their interference on the balanced beam splitter . with this technique , the simultaneous emission occurs 15 times in a second with 300 ns synchronization window and we gathered 12,000 events within an hour . since the single photon states are generated independently , their phase is random and needs no further randomization . </S>",
    "<S> the state after interference is measured by phase - sensitive homodyne detection in both output modes of the balanced beam splitter : one mode is used for conditioning to generate squeezing and the other mode is used for the verification of squeezing in the conditioned state . </S>",
    "<S> the relative phase between a local oscillator and the output mode at both homodyne detections , and the relative phase of two local oscillators which is equivalent to @xmath34 are actively stabilized . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum efficiency of homodyne detectors and the visibility between a signal beam and the local oscillator are both more than 99% . </S>",

    "<S> the quadratures were locked against each other , but their relation to the outside reference varied over time . </S>",
    "<S> this effectively resulted in a statistics which is equivalent to measurement without an outside phase reference . </S>",
    "<S> we will therefore omit the phase dependence from now on . </S>",

    "<S> the standard deviation of the estimated variances depends on the number of data points and therefore on the position and the width of the post - selection interval . </S>",
