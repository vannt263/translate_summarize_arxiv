    "the power which is in principle offered by the idea of the quantum computation stimulated an extensive effort toward realization of quantum gates .",
    "several quantum systems are studied for application in encoding a quantum bit of information .",
    "the spin of an electron confined inside a semiconductor nanostructure is considered particularly promising @xcite .",
    "a number of nanodevices were proposed and experimentally studied for operations on the electron spin @xcite . for practical applications most useful",
    "are devices that function without microwave radiation and without external magnetic fields .",
    "an example of such a construction is the nanodevice presented in ref .",
    "@xcite in which the operations on the electron spin are performed using the spin - orbit coupling , and the transitions between the spin states are induced by ac voltages applied to the electrodes .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling can also be used for operations on the electron spins in opened quantum rings @xcite . in ref . @xcite a system of quantum rings",
    "is proposed for spin transformations according to three basic quantum gates : not , phase shift and hadamard transform in a spin - dependent scattering experiment . in ref .",
    "@xcite a programable array of rings was proposed to split the incoming electron wave function is split into two parts each corresponding to an opposite spin orientation . in these papers",
    "@xcite time independent scattering problem is solved , with the electron spread all over the space with position dependent spin orientation .",
    "recently , we proposed @xcite a different device in which the position of the electron is localized in form of a wave packet which is self - focused by the interaction of the metal with the charge induced on the surface of metal electrodes which are deposited on top of the nanostructure and form induced quantum wires or induced quantum dots @xcite .",
    "the electron localized in the wave packet has a definite spin orientation in every moment in time , and operation on the spin are performed by electron motion within the nanostructure .",
    "in contrast to the spin - dependent scattering approaches in open structures , the operations on the electron spin are performed in a compact nanodevice and result of time - evolution operators according to the original theory of quantum computation . in the proposed device",
    "@xcite one can set the electron in motion along precise trajectories . due to the interaction of the electron with the charge induced on the metal electrodes the electron wave function becomes self - focused @xcite forming a stable wave packet that can be directed to a chosen location within the nanostructure with probability 1 .",
    "systems proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite exploit the rashba coupling @xcite in the absence of the dresselhaus @xcite coupling .",
    "they can be produced in semiconductors of the diamond structure , in si or ge for instance .",
    "a similar device working in iii - v or ii - vi material of zinc blende structure will work in presence of the dresselhaus coupling resulting of inversion asymmetry of the crystal lattice .",
    "for both rashba and dresselhaus coupling present and @xmath0 direction chosen in the growth direction the spin rotations with respect to the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 axes will occur for the electron moving in spatial directions within a plane of confinement @xmath3 forming a narrow angle whose specific value depends on the the coupling constants .",
    "a practical realization of such a device is possible although more challenging then the ones in which only one type of the spin - orbit coupling is present . in the present paper",
    "we assume that the quantum well in which the electron moves is perfectly symmetric so that the rashba coupling constant is zero .",
    "accordingly , we will consider the dresselhaus coupling only .",
    "then , the spin rotations around both the axes will be performed by electron moving in perpendicular spatial directions .",
    "systems discussed below are based on a planar semiconductor structure as previously considered in refs .",
    "@xcite . it contains a 10 nm wide quantum well sandwiched between tunnel barriers each 10 nm thick .",
    "the structure is separated of the strongly doped substrate by a undoped buffer layer 50 nm thick . on top of the other tunnel barrier metal electrodes",
    "are deposited .",
    "the electron gas within the electrodes is a source of the response potential which keeps the electron wave function in a form of a stable wave packet @xcite and sets it motion with a controlled trajectory by application of voltages @xcite .",
    "the electron motion in the growth @xmath0 direction is frozen by the confinement within the quantum well .",
    "we use the following hamiltonian : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the center of the quantum well , and @xmath6 is the electrostatic potential distribution inside the quantum well .",
    "this potential is evaluated in a three dimensional region containing the entire nanodevice by solution of the poisson equation with the method described in detail in ref .",
    "the calculation method allows for description of the self - focusing effect @xcite and the time dependence of the potential distribution during motion of the electron wave packet .",
    "the last term of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) introduces the spin - orbit coupling by the dresselhaus term @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the pauli matrices and the characteristic wave vector @xmath10 depends on the quantum well thickness , the electron band mass and the bulk coupling constant @xmath11 : @xmath12 .",
    "the state functions are written as two rows single column mattrices @xmath13 the simulations that we performed were based on the time dependent schrdinger equation @xmath14 for moving electron wave packet the electrostatic potential must be evaluated in each time step which introduces the time dependence of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) entering into eq . ( 4 ) . in each simulation as the initial condition we take a stationary eigenstate @xmath15 with the potential distribution corresponding to a standing electron packet .",
    "below we apply znte data parameters , in which the dresselhaus constant is equal to @xmath16 ev @xmath17 , the electron effective mass @xmath18 and the dielectric constant @xmath19 . in this material",
    "the self - focusing effect is stronger than in gaas @xcite due to larger effective mass and smaller dielectric constant .",
    "the dresselhaus coupling leads to rotation of the spin of the electron following a straight line around the direction parallel to the electron trajectory .",
    "the rotation angle depends on the distance traveled by the electron and not on duration of the motion .",
    "the rotation over a full angle occurs for the spin precession length @xmath20 .",
    "let us assume that the electron runs in the @xmath1 direction and in time @xmath21 travels the distance @xmath22 .",
    "then , its spin is rotated around the @xmath1 axis by the angle @xmath23 .",
    "the spin initially parallel to the @xmath2 axis @xmath24 after rotation by the @xmath25 angle becomes parallel to @xmath26 vector .",
    "the spin projection operator on the @xmath27 direction is expressed by the matrix operator @xmath28 the eigenequation for this operator @xmath29 is solved by the eigenvectors @xmath30 the operator transforming the basis of eigenstates of @xmath9 to the above basis has the form @xmath31 similarly one obtains the operator of the spin rotation around the @xmath2 axis for the electron moving along the @xmath2 axis @xmath32 one can also derive the operator of the spin rotation around the @xmath0 axis @xmath33 in contrast to @xmath34 and @xmath35 the @xmath36 operator is not associated with the time evolution of the spin , but it is still useful for the system of reference transformations .",
    "in the device based on induced quantum wires the electron packet follows any desired trajectory and consequently one can obtain an arbitrary spin rotation .",
    "for this purpose induced dots and wires @xcite can be used . in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] the system of the electrodes on top of the structure is presented . in this device",
    "the spin operation will be performed for small voltages applied to the gates .",
    "the system contains 13 electrodes serving to various purposes .",
    "a small electrode @xmath37 plotted with the darkest shade of grey localized in the center of the device generates a quantum dot underneath it .",
    "the spin of the electron confined in this quantum dot will store the quantum bit , on which the logical operations will be performed .",
    "pairs of electrodes ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) , ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) and ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) or their parts which are marked in fig .",
    "2 with medium grey shade are used to set the electron in motion along closed loops . during the electron motion its spin undergoes time evolution corresponding to the logical gates : hadamard , not and phase shift @xmath44 gate .",
    "parts of electrodes @xmath40 and @xmath42 marked with lighter shade of grey serve to deliver the electron from the quantum dot to the not or @xmath44 gates .",
    "the electrodes plotted with the lightest grey are auxiliary and serve only to symmetrize the induced potential in order to make the electron trajectory as straight as possible .    the vertically oriented rectangle on the left part of the figure composed of the @xmath41 electrode and the darker part of @xmath40 electrode form the not gate .",
    "the electron going along the shorter side passes a distance of @xmath45 .",
    "its spin is rotated around the @xmath1 axis by @xmath46 angle , the @xmath47 operation is performed on the spin state . at the end of the segment parallel to the @xmath1 axis there is a cut electrode corner @xcite . the electron packet is reflected of the cur corner under a right angle and starts to move parallel to the @xmath2 axis on a distance of @xmath48 with the @xmath49 operator acting on the spin state .",
    "then the electron moves along the @xmath1 and @xmath50 directions with @xmath47 and @xmath51 operators acting on the spin state . assembling all the spin rotations we obtain the not transformation @xmath52 the electron is delivered to the not gate from under the electrode @xmath37 along the quantum wire induced under the lighter part of the electrode @xmath40 .",
    "we find that for the not gate the length of the @xmath40 electrode is arbitrary , since the rotation of the spin along is compensated by the one occurring for the electron going back to the quantum dot @xmath53",
    "in the proposed device the operations on the electron spin are induced by voltages applied to the electrodes .",
    "the subsequent steps of the spin operations can be followed at fig .",
    "[ f3 ] in which one can observe the time dependence of the position of the center of mass of the wave packet and the average values of the pauli matrices . the electron trajectory in the not gate is depicted in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] by the black color . at the initial moment",
    "the same voltage of -0.2 mv is applied to all the electrodes .",
    "the electron is localized under the @xmath37 electrode with the spin set ( almost ) parallel to the @xmath2 axis ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the not operation on the electron spin is performed by application of zero voltage to @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath55 electrodes .",
    "the electron is first attracted to under @xmath40 electrode , starts to move parallel to the @xmath1 axis and initially increases its velocity until the entire packet is transferred under @xmath40 , when the velocity becomes constant and the motion of the packet acquires a ballistic character .",
    "the electron goes to under @xmath41 electrode from below the lighter part of @xmath40 electrode and goes around the loop . at @xmath56",
    "ps , when the electron is found at the uppermost electrode @xmath40 part , we decrease the voltage on @xmath41 and @xmath55 to -0.4 mv to make the electron reflect on the cut corner and leave the gate changing its direction to parallel to the @xmath1 axis in order to complete the full loop .",
    "when the electron returns to under @xmath37 electrode , with the voltage applied to this gate being lower than the @xmath40 voltage , it looses its velocity and when it stops at @xmath57 ps , we raise the voltage of @xmath37 to 0.1 mv to trap the electron underneath . in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] we notice oscillations of the trapped electron position .",
    "they do not influence the electron spin that acquires orientation opposite to the @xmath2 axis direction , accordingly to the not gate operation .",
    "the phase shift operation is performed in exactly analogical way for the electron completing the loop along the rectangle of electrodes placed at the bottom of the device .",
    "the entire operation on the electron spin is performed by assembling separate rotations @xmath58 the phase shift @xmath44 operation is performed for voltages @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath59 set to zero at @xmath60 . for @xmath56",
    "ps the voltage on electrodes @xmath43 and @xmath59 is lowered to @xmath61 mv to make the electron change its direction and to return to @xmath37 below @xmath42 electrode . then for @xmath57 ps the electron is stopped by the voltage on @xmath37 raised to 0.1 mv .",
    "the details of the time evolution of the position and spin can be followed in fig .",
    "this time we deliver the electron to the gate along the electrode parallel to the @xmath2 direction since for the @xmath44 gate the length of the segment parallel to the @xmath2 direction is indifferent @xmath62 .",
    "the last rectangle of electrodes in fig . [ f2 ] is rotated with respect to the not gate by @xmath63 around the @xmath0 axis .",
    "this rotation corresponds to the operator @xmath64 for the electron moving around the rotated structure the spin is manipulated as @xmath65 in which we recognize the hadamard transform . for the hadamard",
    "gate zero voltage is set to @xmath39 .",
    "the electron is extracted to under @xmath39 from under @xmath37 .",
    "when the electron acquires a velocity at @xmath66 ps we put zero the voltage on @xmath38 and after the electron returns to under @xmath37 its voltage is raided to 0.1 mv .",
    "the results of simulations are presented in fig .",
    "electron with spin initially set parallel to the @xmath2 axis goes to the state in which it is parallel to the @xmath1 axis , i.e. to an even superposition of states parallel and antiparallel to the @xmath2 axis . in the proposed nanodevice",
    "the hadamard operation is accomplished in the shortest time since @xmath37 is placed at the corner of the rectangle and the electron does not need to be delivered from @xmath37 to the gate .",
    "the self - focusing effect due to the interaction of the electron packet with the charge induced on the electrodes placed on the surface of the semiconductor nanostructure allows for the electron transfer along a designed trajectory between chosen points in the device in form of a wave packet of a stable shape . in a semiconducting material",
    "in which the the spin - orbit coupling is present the electron motion is accompanied by rotation of its spin by the angle which depends on the direction of motion and the distance traveled . for carefully chosen lengths of the segments one can assembly the rotation into basic single qubit operations . for electrodes forming closed loops with a common quantum dot at the beginning and the end of each electron loop one can apply the quantum gates sequentially in an arbitrary order .",
    "the nanodevice proposed in the present paper is designed to perform any sequence of operation of the most popular single qubit gates : not , hadamard and phase shift . the choice of the operation and its implementation requires application of weak dc voltages .",
    "the performed computer simulations were obtained by iterative solution of the time dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "the presented results contained the time evolution of the position and spin of the electron and their related modifications .",
    "the simulations indicate that the operations designed algebraically can indeed be performed . for the numerical calculations the material data of a specific material ( znte ) .",
    "the proposed device has dimensions which are realistic and can be produced by the present technology .",
    "therefore , both the processes of the spin rotations and the obtained operation times are reliable .",
