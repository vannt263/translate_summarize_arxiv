    "conventional theories of weak localization ( wl ) and interaction corrections to the conductivity ( for review see refs .  ) are developed for the case @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the fermi quasimomentum and the classical mean free path , respectively .",
    "they are valid when the quantum corrections are small in magnitude compared with the drude conductivity @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote electron density and mass , respectively , @xmath21 is the elastic transport mean free time , @xmath22 is the diffusion constant , @xmath23 is the density of states per spin , and @xmath24 . in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems",
    "the quantum corrections arising due to interference and/or interaction effects are logarithmic in temperature @xmath13 at low temperatures .",
    "the situation when @xmath15 and the quantum corrections are comparable in magnitude to the drude conductivity is quite unrealistic .",
    "for example , using the well - known expressions for the phase relaxation time  @xcite @xmath25 one can easily find that the interference correction  @xcite , @xmath26 is less than 15% of the drude conductivity even for @xmath27 mk , when considering the 2d electron gas in gaas with @xmath28  m@xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , for high values of the dimensionless conductance @xmath31 , the conventional wl theory works perfectly down to very low temperatures . in reality",
    ", the situation when @xmath32 and @xmath33 are of the same magnitude occurs at @xmath34 . in this case",
    "the corrections to the conductivity of higher orders in @xmath35 become important and the wl theory is not expected to work .",
    "this range of intermediate conductances is addressed in the present paper .",
    "fundamentally , the properties of 2d systems are controlled by several characteristic length scales . at zero temperature in two dimensions",
    "the disordered wave function is always localized  @xcite over the length scale @xmath36 which can be estimated as  @xcite @xmath37 here the subscript @xmath38 refers to the orthogonal symmetry of the disordered hamiltonian .",
    "real experiments are carried out at nonzero temperature and another length scale @xmath39 over which electrons maintain phase coherence , arises in this case . in semiconductor 2d systems , at low temperatures the inelasticity of electron - electron interaction is the main source of the phase breaking processes  @xcite and @xmath40    measurement of the magnetoresistance ( mr ) is one of the most useful tools for investigation of physical properties of a 2d electron gas .",
    "an external transverse magnetic field @xmath0 destroys the quantum interference and therefore influences the localization .",
    "it breaks the time reversal invariance , thus changing the symmetry of the disordered hamiltonian from orthogonal to unitary . as a result ,",
    "the localization length becomes @xmath0-dependent  @xcite , @xmath41 and changes with increasing @xmath0 from @xmath42 to @xmath43 .",
    "the latter for classically weak magnetic fields can be estimated as  @xcite @xmath44 , \\label{eq : xiu}\\ ] ] that is much greater than @xmath42 for @xmath45 .",
    "thus , there are three key length scales @xmath42 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 that determine the state of a 2d system and its transport properties . in fig .",
    "[ f0 ] we illustrate schematically the behavior of the lengths @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath48 with changing the conductance @xmath49 at a given temperature . in",
    "what follows , we will consider the case @xmath50 .    ,",
    "@xmath42 , and @xmath43 plotted versus conductance @xmath51 . ]",
    "when the phase breaking length is much shorter than the localization lengths , @xmath52 , the system is in the wl regime for an arbitrary magnetic field . in classically strong magnetic fields ,",
    "the mr is produced by the interaction - induced altshuler - aronov correction to the conductivity ( see ref .   for review ) . at low magnetic fields , the negative mr , arising due to the suppression of quantum interference ,",
    "is a well - known manifestation of weak localization  @xcite .",
    "this effect will be the subject of the present paper .    in fig .",
    "[ f0 ] , for values of @xmath49 lying to the left from the point of intersection of @xmath43 and @xmath48 curves  @xcite , the 2d system is in a strong localization ( sl ) regime .",
    "it is commonly believed that the transport in the sl case is of a hopping  @xcite nature .",
    "the magnetoresistance in this regime is also related to the influence of magnetic field on the quantum interference and has been studied in refs .  .",
    "in particular , a parabolic low - field mr in the hopping regime was predicted .",
    "however , the results based on the conventional hopping picture can not be directly applied to the experimental situation addressed in this paper , even when @xmath53 .",
    "this is because the usual concepts of hopping ( including the percolation treatment ) are justified only when the disorder is large .",
    "finally , there is an intermediate regime which we term _",
    "`` weak insulator '' _ ( wi ) regime , when the phase - breaking length @xmath48 is between the @xmath43 and @xmath42 lines . in this",
    "regime electrons are localized at zero @xmath0 and the wl theory does not work .",
    "however , already a very weak magnetic field shifts the actual localization length @xmath54 toward @xmath43 making @xmath55 in such a situation the transport is again of the diffusive nature .",
    "therefore , the theory of weak localization can be applied when the mr is considered for @xmath56 , even though at zero @xmath0 the total conductance is smaller than unity .",
    "obviously , this situation is only possible when @xmath57 .",
    "this is a necessary condition for opening a window between the two localization lengths @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the wi - problem with a low conductance @xmath58 at @xmath59 but with @xmath60 should be therefore contrasted with the conventional sl problem with @xmath61 where the conductivity mechanism is the hopping .",
    "it is worth mentioning , however , that in three - dimensional systems near the mobility edge , a magnetic field also leads to the delocalization of electronic states ( reentrance phenomenon ) , giving rise to a shift of the mobility edge , in a close similarity to the 2d wi regime  @xcite .",
    "actually , the wi - regime has also much in common with the notion of a `` moderate insulator '' , introduced in ref .   to describe the crossover between the wl and sl regimes in quasi - one - dimensional semiconductor wires .",
    "generally speaking , at @xmath62 the nature of transport of interacting electrons at very low @xmath13 ( when the states are localized with large enough localization length @xmath63 ) is not fully understood . at microscopic scales , @xmath64 the electron dynamics is diffusive . the magnetic field serves as a probe of these scales and hence the mr can provide important information about the crossover between the localization and diffusion .",
    "the wl theory can be generalized ( using , e.g. , scaling arguments ) to describe this crossover .",
    "of course , the corrections of higher orders in @xmath35 become then important .",
    "thus it is desirable to understand the role of these corrections in magnetotransport .",
    "apart from the scaling theory of anderson localization , there is a self - consistent theory  @xcite , which enables to calculate the conductivity for arbitrary value of the quantum interference correction for @xmath59 .",
    "however , as we will show below , while at zero @xmath0 the self - consistent theory works rather well , its generalization to the case of finite @xmath0 fails to describe correctly the magnetoconductivity ( mc ) ( see ref .   for discussion ) in the crossover between the diffusive and localized regimes . in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on study of higher - order corrections to the conductivity using a systematic perturbation theory and scaling approach .",
    "experimentally , the low - field magnetoresistance in the range of intermediate conductances and in the crossover regime between the diffusion and localization in 2d systems has been studied in refs .  .",
    "it turns out that the mc even at low conductance , @xmath53 , can be still fitted by the well - known weak - localization expression  @xcite derived for @xmath15 ( we will term it the wlmc - formula throughout the paper ) , but with a reduced prefactor @xmath65  @xcite .",
    "similar observations have been recently reported in refs .  .",
    "in refs .   the magnetotransport has been studied in quasi-2d systems ( doped gaas / algaas superlattices ) and the mr has been shown to be generated by the quantum interference .",
    "a self - consistent theory of the mc has been employed to fit the data . in ref .",
    ", the mr in a weak perpendicular magnetic field was measured in the vicinity of an apparent metal - insulator transition  @xcite in a @xmath66 structure of @xmath19-type . in this experiment ,",
    "the magnetoresistance on the metallic side was perfectly fitted by the wl formula with the prefactor @xmath8 decreasing with lowering the density ( i.e. upon approaching the transition ) . at the lowest density ,",
    "the value @xmath8 was reported  @xcite to be @xmath67 times smaller than that obtained deeply in the metallic state . finally , the authors of ref .  , who measured the magnetoconductance in ultrathin metallic films , claimed that while for @xmath68 the mr is well described by the wl formula , for @xmath69 the mr corresponds to the hopping picture .",
    "an important quantity extracted from the measured low - field mr is the phase breaking time @xmath25 , usually treated as a fitting parameter in the wlmc - formula . with the decreasing of the conductance , the corrections to this formula",
    "become more pronounced and thus the extracted value of @xmath25 may strongly deviate from the true one . therefore , there is a clear need for a systematic ( both theoretical and experimental ) analysis of the mr at decreasing conductance , including the crossover regime @xmath70 a large scatter of experimental data on the phase breaking time which is evident even in the case @xmath71 renders reliable interpretation of the data at intermediate values of @xmath72 difficult .",
    "some of these reasons have been understood .",
    "these are the influence of @xmath73-doped layers  @xcite , dynamical defects  @xcite , and macroscopic inhomogeneities  @xcite on the phase relaxation time , the temperature dependence of the mobility of electrons in quantum well due to temperature dependent disorder in the doped layers  @xcite , and the scattering on magnetic impurities  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the results obtained in ref .   for both interference and electron - electron contributions to the conductivity in the range of not very high values of @xmath49 are ( surprisingly ) in a qualitative agreement with the existing theories of conductivity corrections , developed for high conductance .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "that at not very high values of @xmath72 ( at low electron densities ) , the role of the interaction correction to the conductivity becomes less important and the main effect comes from the interference .",
    "( this is because the interaction correction in the triplet channel  @xcite increases with decreasing @xmath16 , and tends to cancel out the exchange contribution . )",
    "however , the experimental results have been interpreted in ref .   only qualitatively .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of a quantitative analysis of the interference corrections to the conductivity and the negative mr at decreasing @xmath74 .",
    "we are not going to discuss a theory of the mr in the range @xmath75 and @xmath76 corresponding to the sl regime . on the other hand ,",
    "we address , in particular , the wi regime , when the zero - b conductivity can be less than @xmath77 at low @xmath13 .",
    "the interpretation of experimental results obtained for 2d electron gas in gaas / in@xmath4ga@xmath5as / gaas single quantum well structures is based on the theory taking into account terms of higher order in @xmath35 .",
    "we show that the standard `` one - loop '' wl theory is adequate for @xmath78 . calculating corrections of the next ( `` second - loop '' ) order",
    ", we expand the range of the quantitative agreement between the theory and experiments down to significantly lower conductivity of about @xmath79 .",
    "this is largely related to a fortunate circumstance that @xmath80-terms are absent in the perturbative expansion of beta - functions governing the scaling of the conductance  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the corrections to the second - loop expressions derived in this paper are proportional to @xmath81 and hence turn out to be numerically small at such values of the conductivity  @xcite .    we demonstrate that the wlmc - formula can be still used to fit the mr in the crossover from the wl and wi regimes .",
    "it is shown that the main effect of higher - order terms is a reduction of the prefactor @xmath8 in the these formulas , @xmath82 this expression appears to be applicable for @xmath83 when the fitting procedure is carried out in a broad range of magnetic fields .",
    "thus , it becomes possible to experimentally determine the phase breaking time within a wide conductivity range , @xmath84 .",
    "moreover , the qualitative agreement between the experimental data and the ( properly modified ) wl theory persists down to significantly smaller zero-@xmath0 conductivity @xmath85 , provided that @xmath86 .",
    "in other words , one of the main results of this paper is that the theory of quantum corrections to the conductivity works rather well at the limit of its applicability , i.e. even for `` intermediate '' values of @xmath1 of order of unity , down to @xmath87 .",
    "we also show that when applied to the mc in the wi regime , @xmath88 , the fitting procedure based on the conventional wlmc - formula , yields the value of the dephasing rate which deviates from the real one and contains information about the localization length , @xmath89 this observation may be relevant to the explanation of the tendency to a low-@xmath13 saturation of the experimentally extracted dephasing time reported recently in refs .  , where wl was studied at intermediate conductances in the vicinity of the apparent metal - insulator transition .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next three sections are devoted to a theoretical consideration of the problem of the dephasing and quantum corrections to the conductivity . in section  [ sec : th ] , we recall the basic theoretical results on the dephasing , interference correction , and interference induced negative mr . primary emphasis is put on the possible reasons of the above mentioned fact that the low - field negative mr is practically always well described by the wlmc - expression with the reduced prefactor @xmath8 . in section  [ sec:21 ]",
    "we take a close look at the interaction correction in the cooper channel , which is most frequently invoked for the explanation of the reduction of @xmath8 .",
    "the theory of interference quantum corrections developed in the next order in @xmath6 is expounded in section  [ sec:3 ] .",
    "the experimental results and their analysis are presented in sections  [ sec : exp ] and  [ sec : exp1 ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : concl ] is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "let us start with the consideration of wl effects in zero magnetic field at large values of the conductance , @xmath90 ( here the conductance is measured in units of @xmath91 ) .",
    "this condition allows one to treat the dynamics of a particle quasiclassically , relating the conductivity correction to the return probability . within the framework of the conventional theory of the wl developed in the first order in @xmath6 , the interference quantum correction in a 2d system",
    "is given by  @xcite @xmath92 this result holds within the diffusion approximation , justified for @xmath93 . in this paper",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the diffusive regime [ @xmath94 and will not consider the ballistic contribution .    in the wl theory ,",
    "the phase breaking ( also known as phase relaxation , dephasing , or decoherence ) time @xmath25 is a characteristic time scale at which the two waves traversing along the same path in opposite directions lose their relative phase coherence due to inelastic scattering events . at longer times ( or trajectories lengths ) the two waves do not interfere and therefore do not contribute to the wl correction to the conductivity . at low temperatures",
    "the main source of the inelastic scattering is the coulomb electron ",
    "electron ( e - e ) interaction . in this paper",
    ", we will not address the contribution of other decoherence mechanisms such as electron  phonon interactions , scattering on dynamical defects , interaction with magnetic impurities , etc .",
    "generally , the phase relaxation time is different from other inelastic scattering times , e.g. the energy - relaxation time  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the phase relaxation may depend on the geometry of the system .",
    "in particular , the damping of aharonov - bohm oscillations in quasi - one - dimensional rings differs  @xcite from the phase relaxation rate found for infinite wires  @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning , however , that the same conventional wl phase relaxation time governs the temperature behavior of mesoscopic conductance fluctuations  @xcite and the ( two - loop ) wl correction in the unitary ensemble  @xcite .",
    "the phase breaking rate @xmath95 can be calculated using the path - integral approach and/or perturbative diagrammatics  @xcite . as was shown in ref .",
    ", the inelastic scattering events with energy transfer smaller than @xmath96 ( corresponding to the phase breaking rate itself ) do not give rise to the decoherence .",
    "therefore , the dephasing rate can be found from the following _ self - consistent _ equation  @xcite @xmath97 the solution of this equation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] by the solid line .",

    "the behavior ( and even the meaning ) of @xmath25 for @xmath100 is a subtle issue and depends on the problem considered . in principle , when the actual conductance is not very high , the two equations , one for the conductivity and another for the phase - breaking time , are coupled and should be solved simultaneously .    in practice ,",

    "[ fig3 ]  ( a ) .",

    "it is apparent that treating the constant @xmath183 in eq .",

    "( [ eqeecor ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq20 ] ) with @xmath239 .",
    "what is the result ?",
    "for example , processing the experimental @xmath128-versus-@xmath471 curves for actual conductivity range ( @xmath316 at @xmath234  k is about @xmath472 ) we have obtained that the value of seed constant @xmath183 changes from @xmath473 at @xmath474  k to @xmath475 at @xmath476  k. thus , the interaction constant changes with temperature not only the value but , moreover , the sign .",
    "it is clear that this result is meaningless .",
    "if we fix the interaction constant , say , at the value @xmath477 corresponding to the best fit for @xmath476  k , we obtain drastic positive magnetoresistance for @xmath474  k instead of negative one observed experimentally .",
    "therefore , already the formal fitting procedure demonstrates that the electron - electron interaction in the cooper channel is not responsible for the decrease of the prefactor with conductivity decrease under our experimental conditions .    however , as discussed in section  [ sec:21 ] , the actual value of the effective interaction constant @xmath173 yields a small corrections to the mc ( as an example , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cooper ] ) , which can not be responsible for a drastic decrease of @xmath8 .",
    "this is mainly because the ratio @xmath478 is very large in structures investigated .",
    "therefore the relevance of the interaction corrections in the cooper channel can be ruled out in the present experiment . also , we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha(t ) ] that temperature dependence of the prefactor is determined by the @xmath13-dependence of the conductivity rather than by the @xmath13-dependence of the effective interaction in the cooper channel , @xmath173 ,     plotted against the temperature ( a ) and conductivity ( b ) when the latter changes with temperature .",

    "for point - like impurities , @xmath634 .",
    "it turns out that under the condition @xmath635 ( when the second - loop expression for @xmath636 is sufficient ) , this expression is valid for arbitrary @xmath637 including @xmath352 , i.e. in the wi regime .",
    "in this appendix we describe how the values of @xmath157 and @xmath516 playing a pivotal role in the theory of weak localization , can be obtained experimentally .",
    "since @xmath157 is expressed as @xmath638 where @xmath17 is elastic mean free path , it can be found from the drude conductivity @xmath639 and electron concentration @xmath640 .",
    "the electron concentration can be obtained from the hall effect .",
    "the question is : how can one obtain @xmath33 ?    in the case of relatively high conductivity the experimental low - temperature value of @xmath316 instead of @xmath33 is often used .",

    "the use of @xmath643 ( the interaction correction is neglected ) instead of @xmath644 for determination of @xmath157 leads to overestimation of @xmath157 by a factor of about @xmath645 . in its turn",
    "this results in an overestimation of @xmath25 found experimentally by just the same factor .",
    "another possibility is to measure the high-@xmath13 value of the conductivity , believing that the quantum corrections are destroyed by temperature .",
    "however , at high temperatures the electron - phonon scattering comes into play .",
    "also , the ballistic contribution  @xcite of the e - e interaction is @xmath13-dependent , thus making it difficult to determine the true value of @xmath33 .    in this paper the value of the drude conductivity",
    "has been obtained by subtraction of the both interference and interaction corrections from the experimental value of the conductivity at @xmath59 , using eq .",
    "( [ eq24 ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath503 was measured for the structure presented here in ref .  .",
    "it has been found that the value of @xmath503 is about @xmath646 at @xmath647 and decreases with @xmath74-decrease , almost vanishing at the lowest @xmath648 .",
    "the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq24 ] ) itself depends on the value of @xmath119 , which can be found from the negative magnetoresistance .",
    "therefore , treating the interference induced negative magnetoresistance we used the successive approximation method applying both equations eq .",
    "( [ eq20 ] ) and ( eq .  [ eq24 ] ) . for the first approximation we set @xmath33 equal to @xmath316 , found @xmath157 and , then , determined @xmath120 from the fit of magnetoresistance by eq .",
    "( [ eq20 ] ) using it and @xmath8 as fitting parameters . after that we substituted @xmath120 into eq .",
    "( [ eq24 ] ) and found the corrected value of @xmath33 and so on .",
    "an output of this procedure is the value of the prefactor @xmath8 , the ratio @xmath649 and the value of the drude conductivity @xmath33 .",
    "it is sufficient to make from five to eight iterations to achieve an accuracy in the determination of @xmath33 and @xmath120 better than 10% .",
    "so complicated method is not significant for high conductivity ( @xmath650 ) when the quantum corrections are relatively small .",
    "it should be noted that in the above procedure we do not take into account the non - backscattering contribution to the weak localization , which gives an additional temperature independent positive interference contribution equal to @xmath651.@xcite in view of this and all other facts not pointed out here , we estimate an error in determination of @xmath33 to be about @xmath652 .",
    "strictly speaking , in this regime the phase - breaking length loses its meaning , since for electrons localized at @xmath59 the largest spatial scale is given by @xmath42 . in this sense , it is meaningful to use the quantity @xmath25 instead of @xmath48 .",
    "then one can formally define @xmath48 through @xmath25 using the relation valid for delocalized electrons .",
