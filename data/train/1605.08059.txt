    "the standard model of elementary particles , based upon gauge and lorentz symmetries , has been very successful in the last decades , with impressive experimental confirmation of most of its theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it can not be a final theory , but only a low energy effective limit of some more fundamental high energy theory . in some scenarios beyond the standard model , e.g. string theory , lorentz symmetry  and eventually cpt symmetry ",
    "is violated @xcite , thereby generating low energy effective interactions .",
    "this terms are generally suppressed by the inverse power of some large energy scale @xcite and could give rise to small , though interesting , effects in the physics at scales accessible today or in the near future .    during the last two and a half decades , lorentz symmetry violation has been widely studied both from the theoretical and experimental points of view . on the theoretical side ,",
    "a comprehensive list of possible lorentz - violating ( lv ) terms has been developed , what constitutes the so - called standard model extension ( sme ) @xcite .",
    "the sme complements the usual standard model by including a plethora of novel lv interactions in all its sectors . on the experimental side , tests in several areas over different energy scales , ranging from atomic spectroscopy to astrophysics , have placed very strong bounds on the possible lv coefficients ",
    "see e.g. @xcite and , more recently , @xcite .    an interesting way to introduce lorentz violation in the",
    "otherwise lorentz - preserving qed is to modify the electron - photon vertex directly .",
    "this can be done in a gauge - invariant way by coupling a constant , i.e. , space - time - independent , 4-vector background , @xmath0 , with the usual field - strength tensor , @xmath1 .",
    "this derivative coupling would therefore modify the standard lagrangian , which now reads @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the electron s mass and electric charge .",
    "we omit the gauge - fixing term here , since we are dealing with conserved external currents .",
    "the lv background @xmath5 is a non - minimal coupling with canonical dimensions of inverse mass .",
    "this lv scenario has been proposed in ref.@xcite in the context of topological phases and represents a very simple gauge - invariant non - minimal coupling possibility ( it is important to note that this coupling is not considered in the sme @xcite ) . given that @xmath5 is fixed , it plays the role of a non - dynamical background and lorentz symmetry is broken , as it selects a preferred direction in space - time .",
    "it is easy to see that this lv interaction acts as a non - minimal coupling changing the usual covariant derivative to @xmath6 , whereby the extra term is clearly gauge invariant .",
    "this cpt - even modification affects all electron - photon interactions already at tree level and similar derivative non - minimal couplings have also been proposed in several instances : quantum mechanics and the hydrogen atom @xcite , magnetic and electric dipole moments @xcite  also as an interesting way to generate a tree - level magnetic moment for majorana neutrinos @xcite  and scattering processes @xcite .    here",
    "we will focus on the latter case and discuss the impact of the last term in eq . in a few simple and well - know qed reactions , namely : compton and bhabha scatterings , electron - positron annihilation and the life - time of para - positronium . for simplicity , in the following we shall only keep terms in the squared amplitudes , and consequently also in the differential cross sections and decay rates , up to leading order in the lv parameter .",
    "this is a good level of approximation , once lv effects have not been conclusively observed , so it is expected that the associated parameters are very small .",
    "also , as we consider a dimension-5 operator , restricting our analysis to tree level processes , we can ignore renormalizability - related issues .",
    "scattering processes have also been considered in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors find that , due to modifications in the propagators ( already at tree level ) , linear momentum and velocity may be misaligned , therefore making the task of computing cross sections a bit trickier . in the present work",
    "we evade this issue , as the bare propagators are left intact ",
    "possible modifications may arise at the quantum level , though .",
    "this issue is very interesting , but lies outside of the scope of this paper .    as mentioned above",
    ", @xmath5 is a constant 4-vector playing the role of a fixed background , and it can be decomposed in spherical coordinates , with the axes adequately chosen according to the process of interest .",
    "the polar ( @xmath7 ) and azimuthal ( @xmath8 ) angles are fixed relative to the experimental set - up at a given time and , as will become clear in the following , the extra momentum factor introduced by the lv non - minimal coupling will produce terms proportional to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 are the momenta of the in - coming and out - going particles",
    ". these momentum - dependent terms will be responsible for new angle and energy profiles for the respective reactions , especially regarding the azimuthal angle , so that these non - standard features act as lv signatures to be searched for experimentally .",
    "the lv - modified lagrangian , eq .",
    ", translates into an extension of the usual qed @xmath11 vertex , namely @xmath12 with @xmath13 here representing the 4-momentum carried by the photon line , conventioned as being positive ( negative ) for in - coming ( out - going ) photons . in fig .",
    "below we present the generic @xmath14- , @xmath15- and @xmath16-channel tree - level feynman diagrams that contribute to the processes we consider .",
    "the blob indicates the modified vertex , eq . , and for bhabha and compton scatterings only the @xmath14- and @xmath15-channels play a role , whereas for electron - positron annihilation only the @xmath15- and @xmath16-channels contribute .",
    "our goal is to obtain the modifications brought up by the lv piece of the new vertex and , through experimental limits on deviations from the lorentz preserving qed , establish upper bounds on the components of @xmath5 .",
    "the lv parameters associated with other similar derivative non - minimal couplings ( e.g. involving the dual field - strength tensor ) have been constrained to be @xmath17 @xcite , and we shall extract limits of similar magnitude from bhabha scattering and unpolarized electron - positron annihilation , while the bounds from para - positronium are somewhat looser .",
    "a practical comment is in order : the background @xmath5 is assumed to be completely non - dynamical , i.e. , it is fixed in space - time .",
    "this is truly explicit only in an ( approximately ) inertial reference frame , e.g. the sun - centered frame ( scf ) @xcite , so that , in comparison , earth is not  inertial enough \" due to its sideral and orbital motions .",
    "consequently , in earth - bound experiments , also in satellites @xcite , the lv - modified observables ( e.g. cross sections ) should display daily and/or yearly time - modulations .",
    "since experiments are not performed entirely during small fractions of a single day , but over periods of days spread over months , the experimental signals would effectively give information on the time - averaged lv parameters .    to discuss the precise time",
    "- dependence it is necessary to express the lab - frame components , @xmath18 , in terms of the components , @xmath19 , which are fixed ( static ) in the sun - centered frame .",
    "following refs.@xcite , we find that , up to first order in @xmath20 ( earth s orbital velocity @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the rotation matrix depending on the time @xmath25 in the sun - centered frame and co - latitude @xmath26 of the experiment on earth .",
    "the above expressions clearly display the time - dependent nature of the background 4-vector  specially its spatial part  in the earth - bound reference frame .    in the context of the approximations above ,",
    "the time components are easily factored out from the squared amplitudes .",
    "this is not so simple for the spatial components , which involve a time - dependent rotation matrix .",
    "as one of our goals is to place bounds on the lv parameters , we necessarily need to compare our results with the experimental ones . also , due to the already mentioned non - inertial character of the earth - bound reference frame , we must include the time - averaging procedure in our computations .",
    "this is a trivial task for the time components , as  within our approximations ",
    "they are identical in both frames .",
    "on the other hand , the space components always come together with the time - average of some rotation , what , allied to the fact that our bounds are simply estimates coming from the experimental uncertainties , yields a very cumbersome expression which is not easily readable or even converted into a bound .",
    "therefore we shall only explicitly present the limits on the time components of the background .",
    "the corresponding limits on combinations of the space components should be about the same order as the ones for the time components , as we do not expect the averaging procedure to introduce strong suppressing factors .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec_compton ] and [ sec_bhabha ] we present and discuss the lv - modified compton and bhabha scatterings , respectively , while in section [ sec_ee ] we analyse the unpolarized electron - positron annihilation in two photons .",
    "we also used the life - time of para - positronium to find an upper limit on the lv parameters . in section [ sec_conclusion ]",
    "we present our concluding remarks . in our calculations",
    "we have used the package - x @xcite to automatically evaluate the traces and contractions from the averaging procedure .",
    "as a preliminary examination of the effect of the modified vertex , eq . , we consider compton scattering , i.e. , the process by which radiation of energy @xmath27 is scattered by a free electron , usually assumed at rest .",
    "the final out - going photons are emitted with a different energy , @xmath28 , at an angle @xmath29 and , due to 4-momentum conservation , we find that the initial and final photon energies are related via @xmath30^{-1}$ ] , the well - known compton frequency shift result .    in qed , the electron - photon scattering , @xmath31 , can be represented by the @xmath14- and @xmath15-channel feynman diagrams indicated in fig.[fig : diagrams ] .",
    "this process was first studied by klein and nishima @xcite and was one of the first applications of the then new dirac quantum mechanics .",
    "the differential cross section reads : @xmath32 ,   \\label{kn_qed}\\ ] ] whose low energy limit reproduces the classical thomson scattering differential cross section @xmath33 , which is energy - independent . in this section",
    "we will focus on two opposite energy regimes : @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in the former ,",
    "the process is elastic , i.e. , @xmath36 , while in the latter the compton formula gives @xmath37 .",
    "we are interested in determining the effect of @xmath38 to the scattering of radiation off static free electrons .",
    "the total amplitude for this process may be decomposed in two pieces , a pure qed piece and a lv one , @xmath39 . here",
    "we will work with unpolarized electrons and photons in the lab system , where the electron is initially at rest . in this particular reference",
    "frame the participating particles have momenta given by @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , with @xmath43 fixed by 4-momentum conservation .    the deviation from the klein - nishima result",
    "is determined by @xmath44 , where @xmath45 contains , in principle , terms of first and second order in the background .",
    "we are not going to provide the explicit lengthy expression for the squared amplitude here , but we would like to remark , however , that part of the qed - lv interference terms  the one of @xmath46  turns out to be purely imaginary , thus canceling automatically .",
    "the lv modified klein - nishima formula is then given by @xmath47 \\left ( \\frac{\\omega'}{\\omega } \\right)^2 \\times \\\\ & \\times \\left [ \\frac{\\omega'}{\\omega } + \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega ' } - \\sin^2\\theta   \\right ] .",
    "\\label{kn_lv } \\end{split}\\ ] ] interestingly enough , this result shares great similarity with its lorentz - preserving counterpart , eq ..",
    "an important observation is that our lv result is of first order in @xmath48 , as opposed to qed , which is of second order in the fine structure constant . also , following the momenta assignments given above , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , so that the lv differential cross section , eq .",

    "the extra @xmath57 energy factor in the numerator owes its presence to the electromagnetic field - strength tensor in the lv non - minimal coupling .    for low frequency incident radiation , @xmath58",
    ", we notice that @xmath59 , so that , apart from trigonometric functions , @xmath60 .",
    "this means that , relative to the standard thomson result , the low energy limit of the lv differential cross section is generally strongly suppressed , thus compromising any hope of experimental verification in this energy regime .    on the other extreme of the spectrum , for high frequencies , @xmath61",
    ", we have @xmath62 , modulo angular factors , so that @xmath63 while @xmath64 . with this",
    "we find a linear energy dependence , @xmath65 , and we conclude that the lv - induced modifications are actually amplified in the high energy regime .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that the corresponding limit of the usual klein - nishima formula ( for not too small scattering angles ) is found to be @xmath66 , i.e. , classically the electron is not a good scattering target for highly energetic incident photons .",
    "this is clearly contrasting with our lv results , whose signal may be optimally distinguished from those of standard qed at increasing energies .",
    "as stated above , we are interested in determining the angular profiles emerging in the low and high energy limits , so let us start with the first , where we may assume that the electron is a fixed target and the photon bounces off elastically , i.e. , @xmath36 . to proceed we need to specify the nature of the background and evaluate eq . accordingly , so we choose to start with @xmath67 . in this scenario",
    "all angular information contained in @xmath68 and @xmath69 is lost and we have @xmath70 , so that the lv differential cross section becomes @xmath71 ,   \\label{lv_0}\\ ] ] whose angular profile is the same as in the classical thomson result . as discussed above , numerically , however , this differential cross section is heavily suppressed relative to the qed one not only via the small coupling constant , but also through the extra @xmath72 factor .",
    "we consider next the case of a pure space - like background , for which we expect stronger angular dependence in comparison to the qed klein - nishima formula .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we content ourselves with two physically interesting scenarios , namely , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the first case corresponds to a background aligned with the direction of propagation of the incident photon , while the second is lying in the transverse plane .    for a background parallel to the @xmath75-axis ( @xmath76 )",

    "bhabha scattering is the ultra - relativistic scattering of electrons and positrons and is one of the most basic and well - studied processes , serving as a high - luminosity monitor and a tool for the study of both qed and electroweak interactions @xcite . due to its relative simplicity",

    "its experimental value , which agrees well with theory @xcite , was measured to be 125 ps , with a relative precision of @xmath180 , that is @xmath181 @xcite .",
    "the decay rate of o - ps is not significantly more precise than that of p - ps and its relative precision reads 150 ppm @xcite .",
    "the former is , however , a higher order process in qed , so we go for the simplest one , p - ps , without significant loss regarding the outcoming bound on the lv parameters .    the decay rate of p - ps in two photons , although closely related to the calculation performed above , does not follow as a direct sub - product of the previous result . as a matter of fact , when computing the cross section for pair annihilation we were interested in the unpolarized result in the ultra - relativistic limit , whereas in the present case we consider that the kinetic energies of both the electron and the positron are much smaller than their rest energies .",
    "we also take the spin - polarized case of the singlet state .    imposing the appropriate limit , the correct polarization state and only keeping the lowest order contribution in the lorentz - violating coupling , the squared amplitude is only sensitive to the time component of the background vector .",
    "moreover , the result is now isotropic and there is no interference between the pure qed and the lv sectors : @xmath182 therefore , the total decay rate , including the well - known qed term and the extra lv contribution , is then @xmath183 and , assuming the lv part to be very small ( @xmath184 ) , we may write the modified life - time of p - ps to a good approximation as @xmath185 . demanding that the experimental result is well fit by pure qed , we may set an upper limit on the lv parameters by requiring that the associated lv correction does not extrapolate the experimental error , i.e. , @xmath186 applying this criterium , we find the upper bound : @xmath187    it is important to highlight that other authors have considered the effects of different lv sectors in positronium ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this context , the results for spectroscopy measurements are specially interesting , for these experiments are extremely precise , what could give more restrictive bounds on the lv parameters .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the modifications in simple qed processes due to the inclusion of a new non - minimal coupling between the electron and the photon @xcite , eq .. we found that novel energy- and angle - dependent corrections arise already at lowest order in the lv parameter and , up to this order , we were able to establish upper limits on @xmath138 by demanding that the lv - modified physics do not exceed the established qed results by more than a few percent  see eqs . , and eq ..",
    "similar limits on @xmath188 should be expected , cf .",
    "section [ sec_intro ] .",
    "the limit from p - ps owes its relative weakness to the fact that , contrary to the other processes studied , it is a non - relativistic system , since the initial @xmath189 pair is taken as being practically at rest .",
    "the lv non - minimal coupling we consider brings an energy - dependent correction , which , in the low - energy limit ( @xmath190 and @xmath191 ) , means that the lv correction to the decay rate becomes @xmath192 , which is also expected on purely dimensional grounds .",
    "these considerations , combined with the relatively large uncertainty ( @xmath193 ) , are responsible for the looser bound quoted in eq .. as mentioned in the end of section [ posit ] , an application of our modified vertex to the spectra of simple atoms ( hydrogen , positronium , etc ) may improve the limits quite significantly , as spectroscopic measurements reach uncertainties as low as @xmath194 @xcite .",
    "we have focused on purely time- or space - like background configurations , as is customary in the field of lv , but it is clear that such a division is arbitrary  if such a background exists , it would likely be a non - trivial mixture of such components .",
    "however , since we are interested in estimating upper bounds for the background @xmath5 , we refrain from stating a more general result taking a background with time- and space - like components , as this would not improve neither the readability of the results nor the bounds obtained .",
    "it is worthwhile pointing out that o - ps , being the triplet spin state of positronium , naturally offers a 3-vector ( the polarization ) that should couple to the external background .",
    "this means that an analysis of o - ps could bring information on the spatial components of the background .",
    "however , since the experimental uncertainty is of similar size as for p - ps @xcite , we do not expect better limits .",
    "we would like to point out that , even though p - ps may be used to extract upper limits on the background , it is probably does not provide a ` smoking gun ' for lv , since other beyond - the - standard - model scenarios could possibly generate similar effects . in this context",
    ", it is possible that o - ps , being a triplet state , may be directionally more sensitive to a fixed spatial background , thus more sensitive to sidereal variations , which could provide an unambiguous signal of lv .",
    "we have found that , for a pure space - like background , the instantaneous lv - modified differential cross sections generally present periodic contours as a function of the azimuthal angle ",
    "see e.g. figs . and .",
    "the respective pure qed processes do not discriminate different @xmath102-orientations and this is a clear lv signal that could be searched for in collider experiments .",
    "another interesting feature is the scaling of the lv contributions with energy , which enhances its effects in high - energy experiments ( in contrast to the qed contributions ) , possibly allowing for future direct tests of lv in accelerators .    ignoring the boost factors as above",
    ", we note that the temporal and spatial components do not mix , cf .",
    "section [ sec_intro ] .",
    "this implies that our independent analysis of pure time- and space - like backgrounds may be extended to the components in the scf . for the case where @xmath195 , the upper bounds from eqs . and",
    "immediately translate to @xmath196 at @xmath197 cl , whereas from eq .",
    "we get @xmath198 . despite of the relative simplicity of the pure time - like case ,",
    "the pure space - like scenario ( @xmath199 ) is significantly more cumbersome due to the contractions with the 3-momenta of the participating particles .",
    "for this reason we choose not to display the result in terms of the scf variables , as no new significant physical information would be conveyed .",
    "finally , we would like to indicate that other sectors from the sme @xcite could also induce effects in scattering processes , e.g. the @xmath200 and @xmath201 contributions to the photon sector .",
    "since both enter in the quadratic part of the maxwell lagrangian , they would modify the photon propagator , also demanding corrections to the dispersion relations and polarization 4-vectors ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these corrections would also be momentum - dependent and would potentially lead to modifications in the ( differential ) cross sections in qed processes , including the ones treated above . while schreck @xcite has already discussed the @xmath201 sector in connection to compton scattering , we think that a similar analysis of the carroll - field - jackiw @xmath200 term @xcite would be worthwhile , as it could provide complementary local , i.e. , non - astrophysical , bounds on this lv parameter .    besides the points addressed in this paper ,",
    "it is also possible that the class of non - minimal couplings studied here  also with axial couplings containing @xmath202  could produce interesting contributions to the @xmath203 of the electron ( or more interestingly , of the muon ) already at tree - level @xcite .",
    "the tight experimental constraints on @xmath204 together with the expected momentum dependence of the extra lv vertices should allow for better upper limits on @xmath0 . the task of quantitatively evaluating this prospect is currently being undertaken and shall be presented elsewhere .",
