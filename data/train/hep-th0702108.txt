    "thank you for explaining to me why entropy bounds are interesting and for your collaboration on this and other subjects .",
    "the second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a closed system tends to grow towards its largest possible value .",
    "but what is this maximal value ?",
    "entropy bounds aim to answer this question .",
    "bekenstein @xcite has suggested that for a system of energy @xmath1 whose size @xmath2 is larger than its gravitational radius @xmath3 , entropy is bounded by @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the planck length .",
    "this is known as the bekenstein entropy bound ( beb ) .",
    "entropy bounds are closely related to black hole ( bh ) thermodynamics and their interplay with their  normal \" environment .",
    "they are also probably associated with instabilities to forming bh s , however , this has not been proved in an explicit calculation . the original argument of bekenstein",
    "was based on the geroch process : a thought experiment in which a small thermodynamic system is moved from infinity into a bh .",
    "the small system is lowered slowly until it is just outside the bh horizon , and then falls in . by requiring that the generalized second law ( gsl ) will not be violated one gets inequality ( [ beb1 ] ) .    a long debate about the relationship between entropy bounds and the gsl has been going on .",
    "on one side unruh , wald and others @xcite have argued that the gsl holds automatically , so that entropy bounds can not be inferred from situations where the law seems to be violated .",
    "they argue that the microphysics will eventually take care of any apparent violation .",
    "consequently , they argued that the beb does not have to be postulated as a separate requirement in addition to the gsl .",
    "responding to their arguments bekenstein @xcite has argued that it is not always obvious in a particular example how the system avoids violating the bound and analyzed in detail several of the purported counterexamples of this type and demonstrated in each case the specific mechanism enforcing the bound .",
    "holography @xcite ( see below ) suggests that the maximal entropy of any system is bounded by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the area of the space - like surface enclosing a certain region of space . for systems of limited gravity @xmath8 , and since @xmath9 , the beb implies the holography bound .",
    "physics up to scales of about 1 tev is very well described in terms of quantum field theory , which uses , roughly , one quantum mechanical degree of freedom ( dof ) for each point in space ( the number of dof is the logarithm of the number of independent quantum states ) .",
    "this seems to imply that @xmath10 , but the beb states that @xmath11 .",
    "the beb does not seem to depend on the detailed properties of the system and can thus be applied to any volume @xmath12 of space in which gravity is not dominant .",
    "the bound is saturated by the bekenstein - hawking entropy associated with a bh horizon , stating that no stable spherical system can have a higher entropy than a bh of equal size .",
    "a bold interpretation of the beb was proposed by t  hooft and susskind @xcite , that the number of independent quantum dof contained in a given spatial volume @xmath12 is bounded by the surface area of the region . in a later formulation by bousso @xcite their conjecture reads  _ a physical system can be completely specified by data stored on its boundary without exceeding a density of one bit per planck area _ \" . in this sense the world is two - dimensional and not three - dimensional , for this reason their conjecture is called the holographic principle .",
    "the holographic principle postulates an extreme reduction in the complexity of physical systems , and is not manifest in a description of nature in terms of quantum field theories on curved space .",
    "it is widely believed that quantum gravity has to be formulated as a holographic theory .",
    "this point of view has received strong support from the ads / cft duality @xcite , which defines quantum gravity non - perturbatively in a certain class of space - times and involves only the physical degrees admitted by holography .",
    "one way of viewing entropy bounds is that they are new laws of nature that have to supplement the equations that govern any fundamental theory of quantum gravity . from this perspective",
    "the entropy bounds and the holographic principle are presumed to be valid for any physical system and their  true \" form has to be unravelled .",
    "an alternative perspective is that entropy bounds will be automatically obeyed by any physical system and will be a consequence of the fundamental dynamical equations .",
    "as such entropy bounds will not provide additional independent constraints on the system s evolution . in the final fundamental theory entropy bounds will be tautologically correct .",
    "my personal view on this issue at the present time is closer to the second point of view .",
    "my current perspective is that without detailed knowledge of the dynamical equations that govern physics at the shortest distance scales and at the highest energies it is hard to make detailed quantitative use of entropy bounds .",
    "they are very useful as qualitative tools in the absence of the final fundamental theory of quantum gravity when one is trying to determine whether a candidate theory is correct by studying its consequences .",
    "as i will explain they are particulary useful in discriminating among cosmologies that are suspect of being unphysical for various reasons .",
    "is it possible to extend entropy bounds to more general situations , for example , to cosmology ? in 1989 bekenstein proposed @xcite that it might be possible to apply the beb to a region as large as the particle horizon @xmath13 : @xmath14 , @xmath15 being the scale factor of an friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe .",
    "if the entropy of a visible part of the universe obeys the usual entropy bound from nearly flat space situations , then bekenstein suggested that the temperature of the universe is bounded and therefore certain cosmological singularities are avoided . the proposal to apply the holographic bound from nearly flat space to cosmology",
    "was first made by fischler and susskind @xcite and later extended and modified by bousso @xcite .",
    "e. verlinde @xcite proposed an entirely holographic bound on entropy stating that the subextensive component of the entropy ( the  casimir entropy \" ) of a closed universe has to be less than the entropy of a bh of the same size .    to appreciate the necessity to modify the beb in some situations let us think @xcite about a box of relativistic gas in thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that the gas consists of @xmath17 independent dof and is confined to a box of macroscopic linear size @xmath2 .",
    "we further assume that @xmath2 is larger than any fundamental length scale in the system , and in particular that @xmath2 is much larger than the planck length @xmath18 .",
    "the volume of the box is @xmath19 .",
    "since the gas is in thermal equilibrium its energy density is @xmath20 and its entropy density is @xmath21 ( here and in the following we systematically neglect numerical factors ) .",
    "here we are interested in the case @xmath22 which means that the size of the box is larger than the thermal wavelength @xmath23 .",
    "the case @xmath24 has been considered previously in @xcite . in this case",
    "the temperature is not relevant , rather the field theory cutoff @xmath25 was shown to be the relevant scale .    under what conditions",
    "is this relativistic gas unstable to the creation of bh s ?",
    "the simplest criterion which may be used to determine whether an instability is present is a comparison of the total energy in the box @xmath26 to the energy of a bh of the same size @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is the planck mass ) .",
    "the two energies are equal when @xmath29 .",
    "so thermal radiation in a box has a lower energy than a bh of the same size if @xmath30 another way to determine the presence of an instability to creation of bh s is to compare the thermal entropy @xmath31 to the entropy of the bh @xmath32 .",
    "they are equal when @xmath33 .",
    "so thermal radiation in a box has a lower entropy than a bh of the same size if @xmath34 from eqs .",
    "( [ energy ] ) and ( [ entropy ] ) it is possible to conclude the well known fact that for fixed @xmath2 and @xmath17 , if the temperature is low enough the average thermal free energy is not sufficient to form bh s . for low temperatures the thermal fluctuations are weak and they do not alter the conclusion qualitatively .",
    "now imagine raising the temperature of the radiation from some low value for which conditions ( [ energy ] ) , ( [ entropy ] ) are comfortably satisfied to higher and higher values such that eventually condition ( [ energy ] ) is saturated . since @xmath35 eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) is saturated before eq .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) .",
    "we assume that the size of the box @xmath2 is fixed during this process ( recall that the number of species @xmath17 is also fixed ) , and estimate the backreaction of the radiation energy density on the geometry of the box to determine whether the assumption that the geometry of box is fixed is consistent . to obtain a simple estimate we assume that the box is spherical , homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "then its expansion or contraction rate is given by the hubble parameter @xmath36 , which is determined by the @xmath37 einstein equation @xmath38 .",
    "however , if eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) is satisfied then @xmath39 , and therefore @xmath40 .",
    "the conclusion is that if eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) is saturated then the gravitational time scale is comparable to the light crossing time of the box , and therefore it is inconsistent to assume that the box has a fixed size which is independent of the energy density inside it .",
    "thus we have shown that it is not possible to ignore the backreaction of the gas on the geometry under all circumstances .",
    "sometimes the backreaction has to be taken into account .",
    "when the beb is near saturation we have found that the basic assumptions have to be changed so it has to be modified to adapt to an intrinsically time dependent situation .",
    "some have argued incorrectly that it is impossible to discuss entropy bounds in cosmology .",
    "they argue that the universe is the whole system and thus one can not apply thermodynamical arguments that sometimes rely on separating a subsystem from a heat reservoir .",
    "this argument is false as the following braneworld thought experiment explicitly demonstrated @xcite .",
    "let us consider a brane moving in a higher dimensional bh background .",
    "from the brane point of view it experiences a cosmological evolution and one can imagine that the brane falls into the bh and disappears from an external observer s view into the bh horizon .",
    "we are thus in a situation similar to the one envisaged in the geroch process : the thought experiment in which a thermodynamic system is absorbed by a bh .",
    "the aim is to design the process such that the energy absorbed by the bh is minimal .",
    "in such a way the entropy that the bh gains will also be minimal , as both the energy and the entropy of the bh depend only on its mass after the absorption .",
    "we can make the entropy balance during the process and see under which conditions the gsl is respected .",
    "we can gain some insight by modelling a 4d radiation - dominated ( rd ) universe as a brane moving in an ads@xmath41-schwarzschild spacetime . for the bh in ads to be the dominant configuration over an ads space filled with thermal radiation as required for our analysis to be relevant , the bh must be large and hot compared to the surrounding ads@xmath41 @xcite . in this limit",
    "the closed 4d universe can be treated as flat .",
    "the motion of the brane through the bulk spacetime is viewed by a brane observer as a cosmological evolution . according to the prescription of the rs ii model @xcite",
    ", the 4d brane is placed at the @xmath42 symmetric point of the orbifold . on the other hand , in the",
    "so called mirage cosmology @xcite , the brane is treated as a test object following a geodesic motion . in both cases",
    "the evolution of the brane in the ads@xmath41-schwarzschild bulk mimics an frw rd cosmology . from the 5d perspective",
    "one may expect some limits on the entropy of the brane by considering what happens when the bh swallows the brane .",
    "our interest in entropy bounds in general and cosmological entropy bounds in particular originated from the interest in determining the fate of cosmological singularities . specifically , we were interested in finding whether the bounce that is an essential part of the pre - big - bang ( pbb ) scenario of string cosmology @xcite can be physically realized or perhaps there is some principle that requires the solution to be singular .",
    "we needed a general principle because string theory could not provide an explicit enough model of the hypothetical bounce transition .",
    "the traditional tools for finding such criteria were the energy conditions that are used in the singularity theorems .",
    "however , the use of energy conditions is limited because there are examples of cosmologies that do not seem to be problematic in any of their physical properties and for which the singularity theorems are not applicable because some of the energy conditions are violated . on the other hand ,",
    "there are examples of cosmologies for which we expect some problems while the singularity theorems seem perfectly valid .",
    "let us consider , for example , the scale factor for a closed desitter universe .",
    "this is a closed universe containing a positive cosmological constant @xmath25 . in @xmath43",
    "is given by @xmath44 , showing a bounce at @xmath45 .",
    "the bounce is not allowed by the classic singularity theorems .",
    "this is not surprising since the sources of this model violate the strong energy conditions ( sec ) .",
    "the reliability of the sec as a criterion of discriminating physical and unphysical solutions is therefore questionable ( as is well known in the context of inflationary cosmology ) .",
    "conversely , in a 4d contracting universe filled with radiation consisting of @xmath17 species in thermal equilibrium , the singularity theorems imply the the solution will reach a future singularity . but",
    "entropy bounds indicate expected problems already when @xmath46 as we will show later .",
    "motivated by the necessity to resolve the apparent singularity in the lowest order classical pbb scenario veneziano has studied the possible role of entropy bounds and proposed the hubble entropy bound ( heb ) @xcite .",
    "the physical motivations leading to the proposal of the heb are @xmath47 that in a given region of space the entropy is maximized by the largest bh that can fit in it ; @xmath48 that the largest bh that can hold together without falling apart in a cosmological background has typically the size of the hubble radius . in the following we review the basic ideas that led to veneziano s proposal of the heb .",
    "veneziano considered the possibility that the beb or holography bounds can be applied to an arbitrary sphere of radius @xmath2 , cut out of a homogeneous cosmological space .",
    "entropy in cosmology is extensive so it grows like @xmath49 , but the boundary s area grows like @xmath50 .",
    "hence , at sufficiently large @xmath2 , the ( naive ) holography bound must be violated . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath51 appears to be safer at large @xmath2 .    in order to show how inadequate the naive bounds are in cosmology",
    ", veneziano applied them at the planck time @xmath52 , within standard frw cosmology , to the region of space that has become our visible universe today .",
    "the size of that region at @xmath53 was about @xmath54 in units of the planck length @xmath5 , and the entropy density was of about planckian .",
    "thus , the actual entropy of the patch is @xmath55 while @xmath56 the actual entropy lies at the geometric mean between the two naive bounds , making one false and the other quite useless .",
    "the two bounds differ by a factor @xmath57 .",
    "while such a factor is of order unity in frw - type cosmologies , it can be huge after a long period of inflation .",
    "for this reason the ( naive ) holographic entropy bound appears to be stronger than the cosmological version of the beb , just the opposite of what we argued to be the case for systems of limited gravity .",
    "a sufficiently homogeneous universe has a local time - dependent hubble expansion rate defined , in the synchronous gauge , by @xmath58 .",
    "if @xmath59 does not vary much over distances @xmath60 then the hubble radius @xmath61 corresponds to the scale of causal connection .",
    "if on top of this homogeneous background some isolated lumps of size much smaller that @xmath61 exist , then the expansion of the universe is irrelevant and the situation should be similar to that of nearly flat space .",
    "veneziano argued that it is possible in this case that a single hubble patch contains several bh s .",
    "the bh can coalesce and in the process their entropy will increase .",
    "he argued further that this way of increasing entropy has some limit since it is hard to imagine that a bh of size larger than @xmath61 can form .",
    "the different parts of its horizon would be unable to hold together .",
    "strong arguments in this direction were given long ago in the literature @xcite .",
    "thus , the largest entropy in a region of space larger than @xmath61 is the one corresponding to one bh per hubble volume @xmath62 . using the bekenstein ",
    "hawking formula for the entropy of a bh of size @xmath61 leads to the proposal of a ",
    "hubble entropy bound \" , that the entropy is bounded by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the number of hubble - size regions within the volume @xmath12 , each one carrying maximal entropy @xmath65 , @xmath66    the heb is partly holographic since @xmath67 scales as an area , and partly extensive since @xmath64 scales as the volume .",
    "if the heb is applied to a region of size @xmath13 then the bound is the geometric mean of the beb and the naive holography bound , @xmath68      the causal entropy bound ( ceb ) @xcite aims to improve the heb .",
    "it is a covariant bound applicable to entropy on space - like hypersurfaces .",
    "we do not insist , a priori , on a holographic bound , but aim at generality of the hypersurface and then investigate how holography may or may not work . for systems of limited gravity bekenstein s bound is the tightest bound , while , in other situations , the ceb is the strongest one which does not lead to contradictions for space - like regions",
    ".    we shall refer to entropy in a region as to a quantity proportional to the number of dof in that region . to be more precise",
    ", we shall exclude from consideration entropy associated with the background gravitational field itself .",
    "we will however take into account the entropy of the perturbations of the gravitational field .",
    "let us first state our proposal , and then motivate and test it .",
    "consider a generic spacelike hypersurface , defined by the equation @xmath69 , and a compact region lying within it defined by @xmath70 .",

    "the weak energy condition is sufficient but not necessary for reality .",
    "we expect that for physical systems reality will be always guaranteed .    since eq .",
    "( [ ccb ] ) applies to any space - like region , it can be written in a local form rather than in an integrated form by introducing an entropy current @xmath80 such that @xmath81 .",

    "( 1.10 ) ) .",
    "we already see signs here that the physics at short scales and high energies is important in determining the value of the maximal entropy because @xmath76 is generically at least quadratic in the fields .",
    "the physical motivations leading us to the above proposal are similar to those used to motivate the heb : @xmath47 that entropy is maximized , in a given region of space , by the largest bh that can fit in it ; @xmath48 that the largest bh that can hold together without falling apart in a cosmological background has typically the size of the hubble radius .",
    "the second assumption clearly needs to be refined and , possibly , to be defined covariantly . with such a goal in mind , we will proceed as follows : we will start by identifying a critical (  jeans \" ) length scale above which perturbations are causally disconnected so that bh of larger size , very likely , can not form .",
    "we will first find this causal connection ( cc ) scale @xmath86 for the simplest cosmological backgrounds , then extend it to more general cases and , finally , guess the completely general expression using general covariance .    in order to identify the cc scale for a homogeneous , isotropic and spatially flat background ,",

    "nevertheless , the general discussion in this section shows that in this case the ceb is not violated as long as radiation temperatures remain subplanckian , despite the presence of a bounce .",
    "this happens , in part , because the ceb is able to discriminate better between dynamical and non - dynamical sources ( such as the cosmological constant ) , and imposes constraints that involve the former ones only , such as eq .",
    "( [ cond * ] ) .",
    "we have reached the following conclusions by studying the validity of the ceb for non - singular cosmologies :    1 .",
    "violation of the ceb necessarily requires either high temperatures @xmath333 , or dynamical sources that have negative energy densities with a large magnitude , or sources with acausal equation of state .",
    "of course , neither of the above is sufficient to guarantee violations of the ceb .",
    "classical sources of this type are suspect of being unphysical or unstable , but each source has to be checked on a case by case basis . in the examples that we have discussed the sources were indeed found to be unstable or are strongly suspected to be so .",
    "3 .   sources with large negative energy density could allow , in principle , to increase the entropy within a given volume , while keeping its boundary area and the total energy constant .",
    "this would lead to violation of all known entropy bounds , and of any entropy bound which depends in a continuous way on the total energy or on the linear size of the system .",
    "the ceb is more discriminating than singularity theorems . in the examples we have considered it allows non - singular cosmologies for which singularity theorems can not be applied , but does not allow them if they are associated with specific dynamical problems .",
    "finally , we compare our ceb to other bounds , in particular to bekenstein s and bousso s . for systems of limited gravity",
    "whose size exceeds their schwarzschild radius : @xmath8 , bekenstein s bound is given by @xmath334 , and bousso s procedure results in the holography bound , @xmath335 , but since @xmath8 , @xmath336 , and therefore bousso s bound is less stringent than bekenstein s .",
    "consider now the ceb applied to the region of size @xmath2 containing an isolated system . expressing ceb in the form ( [ ccb ] ) one immediately obtains : @xmath337 implying @xmath338 we conclude that for isolated systems of limited self - gravity the bekenstein bound is the tightest , followed by our ceb and , finally , by bousso s holographic bound .",
    "similar scaling properties for the heb were discussed in @xcite .    for regions of space that contain",
    "so much energy that the corresponding gravitational radius @xmath339 exceeds @xmath2 , bekenstein s bound is the weakest , while the naive holography bound is the strongest ( but very often wrong ) .",
    "bousso s proposal uses the apparent horizon @xmath340 while ceb uses @xmath86 . for homogeneous cosmologies , @xmath341 , since @xmath342 , according to ( [ rcck ] ) , is always larger than the average of the two terms appearing on its r.h.s .",
    ", which is precisely @xmath343 .",
    "since , for a fixed volume , the bounds scale like @xmath344 or @xmath110 , we immediately find that ceb is generally more generous .",
    "an important difference between our proposal and bousso s covariant holographic bound @xcite that scales as @xmath345 is that there the entropy @xmath185 is a flux through light - like hypersurfaces .",
    "a detailed comparison with bousso s proposal is therefore more subtle because of his use of the apparent horizon area to bound entropy on light sheets .",
    "this can be converted into a bound on the entropy of the space - like region only in special cases .",
    "e. verlinde @xcite argued that the radiation in a closed , radiation dominated universe can be modelled by a cft , and that its entropy can be evaluated using a generalized cardy formula .",
    "after an appropriate modification of verlinde s bound which evades the criticism about its validity for weakly coupled cft s the new bound is exactly equivalent to ceb within the cft framework .",
    "there seems to be a close relationship between entropy bounds and the gsl .",
    "we have proposed a concrete classical and quantum mechanical form of the gsl in cosmology @xcite , which is valid also in situations far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "we discuss various entropy sources , such as thermal ,  geometric \" and  quantum \" entropy , apply gsl to study cosmological solutions , and show that it is compatible with entropy bounds .",
    "gsl allows a more detailed description of how , and if , cosmological singularities are evaded .",
    "the proposed gsl is different from gsl for bh s @xcite , but the idea that in addition to normal entropy other sources of entropy have to be included has some similarities .",
    "we will discuss here only 4d models .",
    "obviously it should be possible to generalize our analysis to higher dimensions in a straightforward manner along the lines of the generalizations of the ceb to higher dimensions .",
    "the starting point of our classical discussion is the definition of the total entropy of a domain containing more than one cosmological horizon @xcite .",
    "we have already introduced the number of cosmological horizons within a given comoving volume @xmath346 .",
    "it is simply the total volume divided by the volume of a single horizon , @xmath347 . as usual we will ignore numerical factors of order unity . here",

    ", we obtain @xmath358 adiabatic evolution occurs when the inequalities in eqs.([adeqp],[adeqn ] ) are saturated .",
    "a few remarks about the allowed range of values of @xmath353 are in order .",
    "first , the usual adiabatic expansion of a radiation dominated universe with @xmath359 corresponds to @xmath360 .",
    "adiabatic evolution with @xmath361 , for which the null energy condition is violated would require a source for which @xmath362 .",
    "this is problematic since it does not allow a flat space limit of vanishing @xmath59 with finite entropy .",
    "the existence of an entropy source with @xmath353 in the range @xmath363 does not allow a finite @xmath364 in the flat space limit and is therefore suspected of being unphysical .",
    "finally , the equation of state @xmath365 ( desitter inflation ) , can not be described as adiabatic evolution for any finite @xmath353 .",
    "let us discuss in more detail three specific examples .",
    "first , as already noted , we have verified that thermal entropy during radiation dominated ( rd ) evolution can be described without difficulties , as expected . in this case , @xmath366 , reproduces the well known adiabatic expansion , but also allows entropy production .",
    "the present era of matter domination requires a more complicated description since in this case one source provides the entropy , and another source the energy .",
    "the second case is that of geometric entropy @xmath367 , whose source is the existence of a cosmological horizon @xcite .",
    "the concept of geometric entropy is closely related to the holographic principle and to entanglement entropy ( see below ) . for a system with a cosmological horizon @xmath368",

    "this equation of state is simply that of a free massless scalar field , also recognized as the two vacuum branches of pbb string cosmology @xcite in the einstein frame . in @xcite",
    "this was found for the @xmath372 branch in the string frame as an  empirical \" observation . in general , for the case of dominant geometric entropy , gsl requires , for positive @xmath59 , @xmath373 hence desitter inflation is definitely allowed . for negative @xmath59 , gsl requires @xmath374 and therefore forbids , for example , a time reversed history of our universe or a contracting desitter universe with a negative constant @xmath59 ( unless some additional entropy sources appear ) .",
    "the third case is that of quantum entropy @xmath375 , associated with quantum fluctuations .",
    "this form of entropy was discussed in @xcite .",
    "specific quantum entropy for a single physical degree of freedom is approximately given by ( again , ignoring numerical factors of order unity ) @xmath376 where @xmath377 are occupation numbers of quantum modes .",
    "quantum entropy is large for highly excited quantum states , such as the squeezed states obtained by amplification of quantum fluctuations during inflation .",
    "quantum entropy does not seem to be expressible in general as @xmath378 , since occupation numbers depend on the whole history of the evolution .",
    "we will discuss this form of entropy in more detail later , when the quantum version of gsl is proposed .",
    "geometric entropy is related to the existence of a horizon or more generally to the existence of a causal boundary . from my current perspective",
    "the geometric entropy corresponds to entanglement entropy of fluctuations whose wavelength is shorter than the horizon while  quantum \" entropy is probably related to entanglement entropy of fluctuations whose wavelength is larger than the horizon ( see below ) .",
    "we would like to show that it is possible to formally define a temperature , and that the definition is compatible with the a generalized form of the first law of thermodynamics ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "recall that the first law for a closed system states that @xmath379 let us now consider the case of single entropy source and formally define a temperature @xmath16 , @xmath380 since @xmath381 and @xmath382 . using eqs.([frw ] ) , and @xmath383 , we obtain @xmath384 and therefore @xmath385 to ensure positive temperatures @xmath386 a condition which we have already encountered .",
    "additionally , for @xmath387 , @xmath16 diverges in the flat space limit , and therefore such a source is suspect of being unphysical , leading to the conclusion that the physical range of @xmath353 is @xmath388 .",

    "going backwards in time , @xmath59 is prevented by the restriction @xmath398 from becoming too large .",
    "this requires that at a certain moment in time @xmath174 has reversed sign , or at least vanished .",

    "( [ ec ] ) we see that a transition from an epoch of accelerated expansion @xmath395 , @xmath399 , to an epoch of decelerated expansion @xmath395 , @xmath400 , can occur without violation of gsl .",
    "but later we discuss a new bound appearing in this situation when quantum effects are included .    for a contracting universe with @xmath401 , and if sources with @xmath397 exist , the situation is more interesting .",
    "let us check whether in an epoch of accelerated contraction @xmath401 , @xmath400 , gsl is compatible with entropy bounds .",
    "if an epoch of accelerated contraction lasts , it will inevitably run into a future singularity , in conflict with bound @xmath398 .",
    "this conflict could perhaps have been prevented if at some moment in time the evolution had turned into decelerated contraction with @xmath401 , @xmath402 . but a brief look at eq .",
    "( [ ec ] ) , @xmath403 , shows that decelerated contraction is not allowed by gsl .",
    "the conclusion is that for the case of accelerated contraction gsl and the entropy bound are not compatible .    to resolve the conflict between gsl and the entropy bound , we propose adding a missing quantum entropy term @xmath404 where @xmath405 is a  chemical potential \" motivated by the following heuristic argument .",
    "specific quantum entropy is given by ( [ quantums ] ) , and we consider for the moment one type of quantum fluctuations that preserves its identity throughout the evolution .",
    "changes in @xmath406 result from the well known phenomenon of freezing and defreezing of quantum fluctuations .",
    "for example , quantum modes whose wavelength is stretched by an accelerated cosmic expansion to the point that it is larger than the horizon , become frozen (  exit the horizon \" ) , and are lost as dynamical modes , and conversely quantum modes whose wavelength shrinks during a period of decelerated expansion (  reenter the horizon \" ) , thaw and become dynamical again . taking into account this  quantum leakage \" of entropy , requires that the first law should be modified as in open systems @xmath407 .",
    "consider a universe going through a period of decelerated expansion , containing some quantum fluctuations which have reentered the horizon ( for concreteness , it is possible to think about an isotropic background of gravitational waves ) . in this case ,",
    "physical momenta simply redshift , but since no new modes have reentered , and since occupation numbers do not change by simple redshift , then within a fixed comoving volume , entropy does not change .",
    "however , if there are some frozen fluctuations outside the horizon  waiting to reenter \" then there will be a change in quantum entropy , because the minimal comoving wave number of dynamical modes @xmath408 , will decrease due to the expansion , @xmath409 .",
    "the resulting change in quantum entropy , for a single physical degree of freedom , is @xmath410 and since @xmath411 , @xmath412 provided @xmath413 is a smooth enough function .",
    "therefore , for @xmath17 physical dof , and since @xmath414 , @xmath415 where parameter @xmath247 is taken to be positive . obviously , the result depends on the spectrum @xmath416 , but typical spectra are of the form @xmath417 , and therefore we may take as a reasonable approximation @xmath418 for all @xmath17 physical dof .",
    "we adopt proposal ( [ conjecture ] ) in general , @xmath419 where @xmath67 is the classical entropy within a cosmological horizon . in particular , for the case that @xmath67 is dominated by a single source @xmath420 , @xmath421    quantum modified gsl ( [ qec ] ) allows a transition from accelerated to decelerated contraction . as a check ,",

    "string theory is a consistent theory of quantum gravity , with the power to describe high curvature regions of space - time @xcite , and as such we could expect it to teach us about the fate of cosmological singularities , with the expectation that singularities are smoothed and turned into brief epochs of high curvature .",
    "however , many attempts to seduce an answer out of string theory regarding cosmological singularities have failed so far in producing a conclusive answer ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the reason is probably that most technical advancements in string theory rely heavily on supersymmetry , but generic time dependent solutions break all supersymmetries and therefore known methods are less powerful when applied to cosmology .",

    "classical general relativity predicts space - times with event horizons and other causal boundaries , such as apparent horizons , cosmological horizons and acceleration horizons .",
    "observers in space - times with causal boundaries can see very different physics , as demonstrated by comparing the static observer at infinity and a freely falling observer in the schwarzchild geometry .",
    "for the first , the horizon is a very special place : energies of particles diverge and space - time seems to end there , while for a freely falling observer the horizon and its vicinity do not look special at all . in cosmological space - times with causal boundaries",
    "the situation is similar .",
    "the existence of causal boundaries is determined by the large scale properties of space - time , and hence is intrinsically a non - local concept . in cosmology , for example , it is hard for a local observer to determine whether the space - time is de sitter space that has a cosmological event horizon , or a robertson - walker space which looks approximately de sitter .",
    "the interpretation of the thermodynamic properties of bh s and whether they originate from some underlying , more fundamental , statistical mechanics remains unclear , in spite of the intense efforts and the progress that has been achieved over the last 30 years since the discovery by bekenstein @xcite .",
    "quantum field theory ( qft ) in the fixed background of space - times with horizons is a key element in the quantitative understanding of the statistical mechanics of bh s .",
    "qft in such background has several interesting and well - known features .",
    "the quantum vacuum states associated with different observers can be very different from each other , leading to strong particle production effects : the hawking effect and the unruh effect .",
    "in addition , the appearance of large blue shifts of quantum modes near the horizon lead to the trans - planckian problem @xcite .",
    "the proposed resolutions include the brick - wall model @xcite and the stretched - horizon @xcite idea .",
    "the entropy and thermodynamics are also observer dependent , as demonstrated by the classic comparison between the rindler and minkowski space observers in the minkowski vacuum .",
    "the accelerated observer sees a truly thermal state , while for the minkowski observer the temperature vanishes .",
    "the tension between the possibility of evaluating the entropy and other thermodynamic quantities in the semiclassical approximation and their observer dependence and hence their sensitivity to physics at the highest energy scales is intriguing and is not yet resolved .",
    "my current point of view about the physics of space - times with causal boundaries is the entanglement point of view .",
    "i believe that the statistical properties of such space - times arise because classical observers in them have access only to a part of the whole quantum state .",
    "when a system is in a pure state , but one can not access the complete quantum system , and a measurement is performed , one is instructed by the rules of quantum mechanics to trace over the classically inaccessible dof .",
    "this leads to a natural framework for interpreting the physics of spaces with causal boundaries : that it is described by the density matrix which results from tracing over the inaccessible dof . in the context of bh s",
    "the idea was first proposed by t hooft @xcite , and by sorkin and collaborators @xcite , and then extended and elaborated by srednicki @xcite and others .",
    "the entanglement approach considers the fundamental physical objects describing the physics of space - times with causal boundaries to be their global quantum state and the unitary evolution operator .",
    "the entanglement approach has several obvious advantages : it leads naturally to area - law entropy , it can incorporate the observer dependence of bh thermodynamics and of the thermodynamics of cosmological space - times with causal boundaries .",
    "it can naturally accommodate the geometric and quantum entropies .",
    "the first resulting from the entanglement entropy of short wavelength fluctuations and the second resulting from the entanglement entropy of fluctuations whose wavelength is larger than the causal connection scale .",
    "this interpretation is also automatically compatible with entropy bounds and the gsl as long as the evolution equations are  physical \" because from a global point of view it is clear that nothing special occurs when a horizon develops . obviously , there are also some unresolved issues that need to be understood better in this context .",
    "the space - times that are traditionally used to explore the entanglement point of view are spaces with bifurcating killing horizons such as the eternal schwarzschild bh or rindler space .",
    "israel @xcite has shown that the quantum hilbert space of fields in space - times with bifurcating killing horizons has a product structure that is isomorphic to the product structure that arises in thermofield dynamics @xcite . in thermofield dynamics",
    "one formally doubles the hilbert space and evaluates quantum expectation values in the thermofield double pure state in order to evaluate expectation values in a thermal state of the original system . in this context",
    "the entropy is the entanglement entropy that is obtained from tracing over one of the two spaces .",
    "one of the main unresolved issues confronting the entanglement interpretation is the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergence of entanglement entropy and other entanglement correlation functions near the horizon , and its dependence on the number of fields @xcite .",
    "another issue concerns space - times that do not have non - degenerate bifurcating killing horizons . for such spaces ,",
    "it is unclear what is entangled with what , since some of the regions of the extended space - time are missing .",
    "the entanglement point of view has been discussed in the ads - cft context by maldacena @xcite who studied eternal bh s in ads . in 4d",
    ", the space has two boundaries that are topologically @xmath497 , the dual ft consists of two cfts  living on the boundary \" .",
    "the product theory in the tfd state defines the string theory in the bulk , whose low energy limit is the ads - bh .",
    "the ft side is completely well - defined , and its thermodynamics can obviously be interpreted as entanglement thermodynamics .",
    "the low energy state in the bulk is the hartle - hawking vacuum .",
    "the entanglement point of view suggests the following perspective .",
    "suppose that the universe is in a pure state and that it evolves unitarily .",
    "then the entropy of any sub - system of it is entirely in the eyes of the beholder : a particular classical observer .",
    "we have shown @xcite that the entropy resulting from the counting of microstates of non - extremal bh s using field theory duals of string theories can be interpreted as arising from entanglement .",
    "the conditions for making such an interpretation consistent were determined .",
    "first , we have interpreted the entropy and thermodynamics of spacetimes with non degenerate , bifurcating killing horizons as arising from entanglement .",
    "we have used a path integral method to define the hartle - hawking vacuum state in such spacetimes , and reveal explicitly its entangled nature and its relation to the geometry .",
    "if string theory on such spacetimes has a field theory dual , then , in the low - energy , weak coupling limit , the field theory state that is dual to the hartle - hawking state is a thermofield double state .",
    "this allowed us to compare the entanglement entropy to the entropy of the field theory dual , and thus to the bekenstein - hawking entropy of the bh .    to further understand the nature of the time evolution of subsystems in this context we have considered @xcite a collapsing relativistic spherical shell in a free quantum field theory",
    "once the center of the wavefunction of the shell passes a certain radius @xmath498 , the degrees of freedom inside @xmath498 are traced over .",
    "we have found that an observer outside this region will determine that the evolution of the system is non - unitary .",
    "the non - unitary evolution occurs only when the wavefunction is in the process of crossing the boundary and the amount of non - unitarity is proportional to the area of the boundary .",
