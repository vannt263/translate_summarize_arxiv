    "the idea of implementing quantum information devices based on the use of single atoms or molecules has gone progressively growing up in the course of the last few years .",
    "the reason can be envied in the high contemporary evolution of theoretical dynamical models along with the ability reached by experimentalists in manipulating quantum objects first considered _",
    "theoretician s tools _ @xcite .",
    "the state of art is that , although it has been possible to obtain entanglement conditions between elementary systems in different physical scenarios @xcite , the temporal persistence of quantum coherence is an open problem . in this moment",
    ", it is therefore necessary to put attention on the theoretical aspects of decoherence in order to predict the experimental conditions under which it is maximally reduced @xcite .",
    "almost decoherence free substates seem to have the characteristics of eligibility needed to implement quantum computation .",
    "their generation and temporal persistence can be theoretically predicted in some high symmetrical models @xcite .",
    "the application of the early introduced formal solution of the markovian master equation ( nud theorem ) @xcite has supplied , in the few analyzed systems , the prediction of a conditional building up of entanglement .",
    "the result is obtained under symmetrical condition corresponding to specific locations of involved subsystems ( atoms , molecules ) . unfortunately , despite the positive results in isolating single quantum objects @xcite , the difficulties connected with the location of more than one atoms in fixed arbitrary points is an open task .    in general , practical quantum gates implementation needs to meet stringent criteria in order to operate successfully @xcite . _",
    "first of all , the qubits has to be sufficiently isolated in order to manipulate them in a controlled environment .",
    "they need to be initialized precisely .",
    "the effective interactions among qubits should be carefully tuned and a set of quantum operations should be made possible in order to perform any other required quantum gates . finally , the system must be scalable to more than a few qubits _ @xcite .",
    "these considerations have encouraged us to speculate about the possibility to use hybrid entanglement conditions in order to implement quantum protocols .",
    "a single mode cavity and a two level atom may be considered a hybrid two qubits system .",
    "the isolation of a single atom for enough long time inside a cavity is today possible .",
    "moreover , the jaynes and cummings model is one of the few exactly soluble models in quantum optics .",
    "it predicts many interesting non classical states experimentally testable in laboratory @xcite .",
    "in realistic situation , however , one performs experiments in cavity with finite q and in presence of atomic spontaneous emission .",
    "so it become of fundamental importance to know how the predictions of this model are affected by the unavoidable presence of loss mechanisms .",
    "this problem is currently very extensively studied , the main approximation being the assumption of two different reservoirs , one for the atom and one for the cavity mode respectively @xcite .",
    "the further calculation are simpler under this approximation because the two bath do nt introduce coherences between the atom and the cavity : the master equation is in lindblad form and it is easier to solve than the one we derive ; the solution being the total destruction of coherences because of the two different and nonspeaking channels of dissipation .",
    "moreover , my equation contains the simple one as particular case .",
    "actually , here we show to be able to find the exact solution of a dissipative j - c model assuming a common reservoir for the bipartite system , which , on the ground of the above consideration , appears to be a more realistic hypothesis .",
    "this leads to the prediction of new cooperative effects , induced by the zero - point fluctuations of environment , between the atom and the cavity mode as the creation of conditional transient entanglement , tending to become stationary as the strengths of the coupling with the reservoir take a well defined value . finally , in order to be maximally realistic , prof .",
    "j.m.reimond suggested me to consider also the loose of energy due to the imperfect reflection on the mirrors .",
    "this correction in the microscopic model does not introduce complication in the solution of the relative master equation because the new bath is independent from the first one and , indeed , easily treating from a theoretical point of view ( not induced coherences ) . in presence of the second channel of decoherence",
    "the building up of entanglement exists during the transient period in which the atom is confined inside the cavity .",
    "the long time solution ( the order of magnitude of the time involved is given in the next sections ) shows that the introduction of the second bath makes disappear coherence ( rabi oscillation ) among the two subsystem involved : the atom and the cavity mode . despite this fact ,",
    "the time involved in decoherence process can be made much longer than those necessary to implement a quantum protocol as deducible from the theoretical analysis here developed if interfaced with the experimental measures performed by aroches group .",
    "the measures appear well fitted by the theoretical model here proposed .",
    "the standard models ( two different baths ) are able to reproduce only the top of the curve ( dissipation @xcite ) .",
    "instead mine is able to reproduce also the lower part ( cooperation @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is structured as follow : in section ii we report the principal step and approximation leading to the microscopic derivation of the markovian master equation ( mme ) and we solve it when @xmath0 , showing also the full equivalence between mme and piecewise deterministic processes ( pdp ) @xcite . in section iii",
    "we apply the nud theorem to derive the solution to the dissipative j - c model . in section",
    "iv we try to justify the obtained dynamical behaviour in terms of continuous measurement theory .",
    "it is well know that under the rotating wave and the born - markov approximations the master equation describing the reduced dynamical behavior of a generic quantum system linearly coupled to an environment can be put in the form @xcite @xmath1+d(\\rho_s ( t)),\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the hamiltonian describing the free evolution of the isolated system , @xmath3    @xmath4    @xmath5    and @xmath6    @xmath7 being the one - sided fourier transforms of the reservoir correlation functions .",
    "finally we recall that the operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 , we are going to define and whose properties we are going to explore , act only in the hilbert space of the system .    eq .

    "are operators acting respectively on the hilbert space of the system and of the reservoir .",
    "the eq.([hi ] ) can be written in a slightly different form if one decomposes the interaction hamiltonian into eigenoperators of the system and reservoir free hamiltonian .",
    "definition supposing the spectrum of @xmath2 and @xmath13 to be discrete ( generalization to the continuous case is trivial ) let us denote the eigenvalue of @xmath2 ( @xmath13 ) by @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) and the projection operator onto the eigenspace belonging to the eigenvalue @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) by @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "then we can define the operators : @xmath18 @xmath19    from the above definition we immediately deduce the following relations    @xmath20=-\\omega a_{\\alpha } ( \\omega),\\;\\;\\ ; [ h_b , b_{\\alpha } ( \\omega)]=-\\omega b_{\\alpha } ( \\omega),\\ ] ]    @xmath21=+\\omega a^{\\dag}_{\\alpha } ( \\omega)\\;\\;\\ ; and \\;\\;\\ ; [ h_b , b^{\\dag}_{\\alpha } ( \\omega)]=+\\omega b^{\\dag}_{\\alpha } ( \\omega).\\ ] ]    an immediate consequence is that the operators @xmath22 e @xmath23 raise and lower the energy of the system @xmath24 by the amount @xmath25 respectively and that the corresponding interaction picture operators take the form    @xmath26    @xmath27    finally we note that @xmath28 summing eq .",

    "we will solve a cauchy problem assuming the factorized initial condition to be an eigenoperator of the free energy @xmath42 .",

    "the proof of the theorem is contained in the paper @xcite .",
    "my aim here is to give an explanation of the found implication .",
    "a pdp is a statistical mixture of alternative generalized trajectories evolving individually in a deterministic way .",
    "this statement is mathematically given by the equation @xmath47    where the quantum trajectories @xmath48 are obtained by the deterministic non - unitary equation    @xmath49    where , in particular , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 being @xmath54 with @xmath55 hermitian .",
    "finally , @xmath56    these last are _ generalized _ respect to f.petruccione and h.j.carmochael approach , which leads to @xmath57 , but nobody is able to do it , with exception of few highly symmetrical systems .",
    "the found solution ( nud theorem ) ensures that the dynamical processes , whose statistical mixture gives the open system stochastic evolution , are deterministic .",

    "this , as already highlighted , in general , introduces simplification in the further calculations , but because of the difficulty to recast the equation in this form the results obtained are in general merely formal .",
    "tough the eq .",
    "( [ brutta ] ) seems complicated to use it is a powerful predictive tool .",
    "we have tested it deriving the photocounting formula @xcite ; reproducing the environment - induced entanglement between two two - level not - direct - interacting atoms placed in fixed arbitrary points in the free space @xcite and carmichael unravelling of the master equation @xcite .",
    "moreover i have tested the nud theorem s predictive capability solving the dynamics of two two - level dipole - dipole interacting atoms placed in fixed arbitrary points inside a single mode cavity in presence of atomic spontaneous emission and cavity losses @xcite ; @xmath58 two - level not - direct - interacting atoms placed in fixed arbitrary points inside a single mode cavity in presence of atomic spontaneous emission and cavity losses @xcite ; a bipartite hybrid model , known as jaynes - cummings model , constituted by an atom and a single mode cavity linearly coupled and spontaneously emitting in the same environment ( next subsection ) and two harmonic oscillator linearly coupled and spontaneously emitting in the same environment ( work in progress ) .",
    "two of my results are already published , others will be object of future papers .",
    "all of them contain the same ( predictable ?",
    "@xcite ) result : multipartite systems , discarding the physical nature of the parts and of the environment , can exhibit entangled stationary states towards the system can be guided by a probabilistic scheme of measurement .",
    "the jaynes - cummings model describes , under the rotating wave approximation , the resonant interaction between a single two - level atom and the single mode of the electromagnetic field protected by a perfect cavity ( no loosing of energy ) .",
    "the model has been introduced in 1963 @xcite in order to analyze the classical aspects of spontaneous emission and to understand the effects of quantization on the atomic evolution . actually , despite its apparent simplicity",
    ", this model has revealed interesting non - classical proprieties characterizing the matter - radiation interaction .",
    "moreover , thanks to the recent experimental implementation of high q cavities , it is today possible to verify the most of the theoretical predictions of the model @xcite .",
    "the major experimental limitation is related to the coupling with a chaotic environment able to destroy the quantum coherences . a theoretical approach including the loss of energy due to the interaction of the atom and the cavity mode with the free electromagnetic field is more complete and , as we will show",
    ", it is suitable to reproduce the experimental measured decay of the population of the atom @xcite . in particular , assuming a common bath of interaction between the cavity mode and the atom , the theoretical probability to find the atom in the excited state performs rabi oscillation exponentially decaying .",
    "this fact is consistent with the open dynamics but it is not the only effect .",
    "actually , the common bath induces cooperation between the two involved parts ( mode and atom ) .",
    "this behavior competes with the exponential decay . in the long time",
    "limit the the exponential decay wins on cooperation if we work under the experimental condition performed by haroche group . in the paper @xcite",
    "is reported the experimental graph relative to the probability to find the atom in its excited state as a function of the time .",
    "we can interpret the upper part of the figure as the exponential decay and the lower part of it ( increasing of probability ) as the cooperation induced by the common reservoir .",
    "the new theoretical approach , here presented , is better than the usual one ( two independent baths ) because it is able to reproduce the experimental curve in a complete way .",
    "in fact the two bath approximation keeps account only for the dissipation meaning that the rabi oscillation of the atomic population goes to zero every period characterizing the free dynamics of the bipartite system . in this case",
    "the cooperative part of the dynamics disappears : the two parts do not speak trough the common bath , the main behavior being the dissipation of energy in the reservoirs .",
    "moreover it is possible to demonstrate that single bath approach is more general than the other including it as particular case .",
    "this fact is very well understood if the parts are , for example , two or more atoms , in which case the cooperation is the maximum one if the distance among atoms is small enough and it reaches its minimum value when the distance goes to infinity @xcite . in the last case the out diagonal terms of the spectral correlation tensor",
    "go to zero meaning that the parts see independent reservoirs .",
    "the lack of a microscopical derivation of the coupling constant of the mode with the electromagnetic field makes difficult the analytical derivation of an analogue relation in the case here analyzed .",
    "despite this fact it will be shown that the single bath case is more general than the other one because the independent baths case does not reproduce the out diagonal terms giving a simplified master equation unable to reproduce part of the experimental measurements .",

    "this approximation is made possible because we have considered , ab initio , a direct linear static interaction among the parts respect to which the lamb - shift is negligible . in the above equation    @xmath68    where    @xmath69",
    "@xmath70    @xmath71    @xmath72    the master equation for @xmath73 can be solved applying the nud theorem to this case :    @xmath74    where @xmath58 is the number of the excitation initially given to the system ( @xmath75 ) and @xmath76 is the index giving the number of excitations characterizing every quantum trajectory .",
    "the trajectories evolve in time in accordance with    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is given by eq.([brutta ] ) and @xmath79 is a nonunitary temporal evolution operator , @xmath53 being , in general , non - hermitian as it appears from the following equation :    @xmath80    where @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84    let us suppose the system in the initial state characterized by @xmath85 excitations in the cavity mode and the atom in its excited state @xmath86 : @xmath87 then every quantum trajectory @xmath88 belonging to statistical mixture characterizing the dynamical evolution of the system will have the form @xmath89    the highest energy subspace ( @xmath90 ) is easily solved and the block vector relative to this subspace has the form : @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94 where @xmath95    let us note that if we have started from the initial condition @xmath96 we have obtained the same dynamical behavior .",
    "this fact ensures that an arbitrary linear combination of the two different initial condition will bring to the same dynamics .",
    "this fact is really important because it is not simple to prepare one or the other of the initial states .",
    "actually , when we inject an excitation inside the system we can only know that the system is in a statistical mixture of the two states .",
    "but we have seen seen that the dynamics is not case sensitive and therefore a statistical mixture of the two states leads to the described dynamical evolution .",
    "the circumstance that we succeed in finding the explicit time dependence of the solution of the master equation ( [ jcme ] ) provides an occasion to analyze in detail at least some aspects of how entanglement is getting established in our bipartite system .",
    "as particular case we can choose @xmath97 so obtaining in a simple way the complete dynamics of the open system in the form @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 on the basis of the block diagonal form exhibited by eq .",
    "( [ statmix ] ) , at a generic time instant @xmath101 , the system is in a statistical mixture of the vacuum state of the system and of a one - excitation appropriate density matrix describing with certainty the storage of the initial energy . in order to analyze the time evolution of the degree of entanglement that gets established between the two initially uncorrelated parties , we exploit the concept of concurrence @xmath102 first introduced by wootters @xcite .",
    "if , at an assigned time @xmath101 , no photon have been emitted the conditional concurrence @xmath102 assumes the form :    @xmath103    in the analyzed case ( @xmath97 ) , as clearly shown in fig.1 , obtained using the experimental values setted by haroche s group , the degree of entanglement starting from zero increases during the transient collapsing to the initial value when time is long enough .",
    "this fact depend on the choice of the atom whose spontaneous emission time @xmath104 is much longer than the cavity damping time @xmath105 . in accordance to this fact",
    "the probability to find the atom in the excited state starting from @xmath106 go to zero when @xmath107 as clearly showed in fig.2 .",
    "this figure reproduce in a perfect way the experimental measures performed by haroche s group @xcite .",
    "the standard theoretical models assume two different channel of dissipation ( one for the atom and one for the cavity mode ) .",
    "the corresponding master equation is simpler to solve because of the absence of _ cooperative terms _ @xcite",
    "but the corresponding dynamics fits only the upper part of the measures of the haroche s group ( _ dissipative behavior _ ) .",
    "the low part of the graph represent the cooperation induced by the common reservoir between the cavity mode and the atom .",
    "such cooperation become the maximum one when @xmath108 and @xmath109 , as clearly shown in fig.3 and fig.4 .",
    "these ones depicted the concurrence and the probability to find the atom in its excited state , respectively .    under this condition ( decoherence free regime )",
    "( [ statmix ] ) suggests that , for @xmath107 , the correspondent asymptotic form assumed by @xmath46 is time independent and such that the probability of finding energy in the bipartite system is @xmath110 : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the ground state of the bipartite system and @xmath113 is the maximally antisymmetric entangled state of the system .",
    "this fact suggests that _ stationary _ entangled states of the jc system can be generated by putting a single photon detector able to capture in a continuous way all the excitations lost by the system in the reservoir .",

    "instead , the presence of two different channel of dissipation modifies the dynamical behavior .",
    "actually , the system has now the possibility to loose energy in environments that do not speak each other .",
    "this means that , when the time is much longer than the sum of the single emission time , the coherence induced by the common bath during the transient will go to zero in the long time domain . despite this fact",
    ", the dechoerence time can be made as long as we need to implement the required quantum protocol . actually , named @xmath118 the cavity decay rate , if @xmath118 is much greater than @xmath108 , then the storage of energy can be maximized for a time sufficient to realize the quantum protocol .",
    "in this paper we have considered the interaction of a jaynes and cummings system with the electromagnetic field ( and with another phenomenological zero temperature bath ) in its vacuum state and , solving the dynamical problem , we have analyzed the amount of entanglement induced in the bipartite system by the common electromagnetic reservoir .",
