    "subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars are evolved extreme horizontal branch stars with effective temperatures in the range 20,000@xmath142,000 k and low masses of around 0.5 @xmath2 ( e.g. , saffer et al .",
    "they are believed to be composed of a helium - burning core surrounded by a hydrogen envelope too thin for them to ascend the asymptotic giant branch after core helium exhaustion ( heber 1986 ; dorman 1995 ) .",
    "instead , they evolve off and along the horizontal branch and eventually end their lives as low - mass white dwarfs ( bergeron et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the discovery of pulsators among subdwarf b stars ( kilkenny et al . 1997 ) has opened them up to asteroseismological probing , an important tool for understanding the internal structure of these interesting objects .",
    "pulsating subdwarfs can be divided into two categories : the rapidly pulsating ec 14026 stars and the slowly oscillating long - period variable subdwarf b stars ( or pg 1716 stars for short ) .",
    "the first ec 14026 stars were discovered to be pulsating multi - periodically with typical periods in the range 100 - 200 s in 1997 ( kilkenny et al . 1997 ; koen et al .",
    "1997 ; stobie et al .",
    "1997 ; odonoghue et al .",
    "1997 ) . at about the same time and completely independently , charpinet et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997 ) predicted the existence of pressure mode ( @xmath3-mode ) instabilities in these stars caused by a classical kappa mechanism associated with the iron opacity peak in the subdwarfs envelopes .",
    "this opacity peak in turn is dependent on a local overabundance of iron , which is achieved by the competitive action of gravitational settling and radiative levitation .",
    "as the relative contributions of these two processes are determined by the surface gravity and the effective temperature of the star , all pulsating subdwarfs should lie in a designated instability strip on the log @xmath4 diagram . to date , the number of known ec 14026 stars has risen to 33 ( see kilkenny 2002 , silvotti et al .",
    "2002 , billres et al .",
    "2002 , and fontaine et al .",
    "2004 for a recent census ) , all of which fall into the theoretically predicted instability strip , clustering around @xmath55.75 and @xmath633,000 .",
    "since theoretical and observed pulsational properties are in good agreement , it is believed that a qualitative understanding of the pulsation mechanism has been reached . beyond this , detailed quantitative interpretations of observed period spectra have been possible in a few instances ( brassard et al .",
    "2001 ; charpinet et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 ) , allowing the identification of the modes excited through the so - called forward method .",
    "being the ultimate goal in asteroseismology , this led to the determination of the stars fundamental parameters , including the mass fraction of the thin hydrogen shell which can not be deduced otherwise .",
    "it goes without saying that independent observational tests of these mode idendifications would be most welcome .",
    "in particular , the dense period spectra detected in certain ec 14026 pulsators force the controversial inclusion of modes with @xmath0 = 3 and 4 in the asteroseismological process , since there are not enough theoretical modes with @xmath0 = 0 , 1 , and 2 to account for the mode density observed .",
    "long - period variables constitute a newer , less extensively studied class of subdwarf b pulsator .",
    "their variability was first announced by betsy green at the `` asteroseismology across the h - r diagram '' conference held in porto in july 2002 ( green et al .",
    "2003a ; see also green et al .",
    "slowly pulsating sdb stars are distinctly cooler than their short period counterparts and show multi - periodic , low - amplitude ( @xmath7 1 milli - magnitude ) luminosity variations with typical periods between 0.8 and 1.6 hours .",
    "these are about a factor of 30 longer than those of the ec 14026 stars , and automatically imply high radial order gravity modes ( @xmath8-modes ) .",
    "early ideas on a possible excitation mechanism for this new class of star included tidal excitation in a close binary system ( fontaine et al .",
    "2003a ) and a mechanism involving a slow reviving of the hydrogen shell ( green et al .",
    "2003a ) , but proved unfruitful .",
    "a much more promising mechanism capable of qualitatively explaining the observed periods was brought forward more recently ( fontaine et al .",
    "2003b ) and involves the same driving process that so successfully explains the instabilities in the ec 14026 stars .",
    "this is analogous to the case of the @xmath9 cep / slowly pulsating b stars on the main sequence ( dziembowski & pamyatnykh 1993 ; dziembowski , moskalik , & pamyatnykh 1993 ; gautschy & saio 1993 ) .    in their paper describing the excitation mechanism in the slow pulsators , fontaine et al .",
    "( 2003b ) built a series of representative models of subdwarf b stars along the extreme horizontal branch and computed their nonadiabatic pulsation properties in a wide range of periods for modes with @xmath0 = 0 to @xmath0 = 8 .",
    "this uncovered two distinct `` islands '' of instability in the pulsational period vs @xmath10 diagram ( as can be seen in their figure 4 ) .",
    "the first of these is clustered around @xmath11 k and corresponds to the short period , low - order @xmath3-modes typical of the ec 14026 stars , where modes with degree values of @xmath0 = 0 and upward are driven .",
    "the second region of instability , attributed to the long period pulsators , lies at lower temperatures between 22,000 and 26,000 k and features @xmath8-modes with long periods similar to those observed in the slow oscillators . however , in the majority of models only modes with degree indices of @xmath0 = 3 and higher can currently be excited , which would imply that the long - period luminosity variations observed in the cooler subdwarfs correspond to modes with @xmath0 = 3 , 4 , and 5 .",
    "this is in conflict with canonical wisdom , which suggests that modes with @xmath12 should generally not be observable due to cancellation effects when integrating over the visible disk of the star . while fontaine et al .",
    "( 2003b ) argue that the low amplitudes of the variations observed point to modes of relatively high degree indices , they concede that the instability calculations are subject to a real blue - edge problem . in particular , we now know of long - period pulsators with effective temperatures as high as @xmath13 k , which according to current theory should excite only modes with @xmath14 .",
    "as it does not seem feasible that these could be observed even in the best of circumstances , it is clear that we face major challenges as far as mode identification for the slow pulsators is concerned .",
    "however , there is scope for improvement on the theoretical side . following a suggestion of hideyuki saio",
    ", we are currently developing more realistic subdwarf b star models that incorporate the presence of helium in the iron radiative levitation calculations , rather than adopting the pure hydrogen background assumed by fontaine et al .",
    "( 2003b ) .",
    "while this may well lead to a better description of the pg 1716 stars blue edge , we nevertheless feel it would be highly beneficial if the degree indices of the periods observed could be determined using a method completely independent of the instability calculations .    the best way of achieving this is to exploit the wavelength dependence of a mode s pulsational amplitude , which depends on @xmath0 as well as on other parameters such as the viewing angle and the intrinsic amplitude of the oscillation in question . by calculating the ratio of amplitudes in different wavebands , the latter unknown quantities can be elimitated , leaving ( to a first approximation ) a dependence only on @xmath0 and the atmospheric parameters of the star .",
    "the theoretical colour - amplitude ratios can thus be computed for a given target and compared to pulsational amplitudes from multi - colour photometry in order to determine the modes degree indices .",
    "likeways , phase shifts between oscillations in different wavebands may be exploited in certain cases .",
    "this method is by no means revolutionary and has been applied to many different types of pulsating star , such as @xmath15 scuti stars ( garrido , garca - lobo , & rodriguez 1990 ) , @xmath9 cepheids ( cugier , dziembowski , & pamyatnykh 1994 ) , zz ceti white dwarfs ( robinson et al .",
    "1995 ; fontaine et al .",
    "1996 ) , and @xmath16 doradus stars ( breger et al . 1997 ) , to name just a few .",
    "attempts to understand the observed period spectrum on the basis of multi - colour photometry have also been made for ec 14026 stars , first by koen ( 1998 ) and more recently by jeffery et al .",
    "the former study gives a qualitative interpretation of the periods observed for kpd 2109 + 4401 based on the theory of watson ( 1988 ) , while the latter asserts to have provisionally identified the modes detected for the fast oscillators kpd 2109 + 4401 and hs",
    "0039 + 4302 . in this case",
    ", the identification is based on amplitude ratios computed by ramachandran , jeffery , & townsend ( 2004 ) as well as on comparisons with the pulsational properties of the evolutionary sequences published by charpinet et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .    in the present study",
    ", we assess the potential of multi - colour photometry for pulsating sdb stars in some detail . using a grid of specially designed model atmospheres ,",
    "we are able to compute vital quantities such as the emergent specific intensities and their derivatives to high accuracies .",
    "moreover , we carry out full nonadiabatic pulsation calculations in order to obtain eigenfunctions that are as realistic as possible , an aspect that was not studied by ramachandran et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the theory of colour - amplitude variations in pulsating stars .",
    "we then describe our computations for subdwarf b stars , and present results for a representative ec 14026 and pg 1716 model before examining the influence of the atmospheric parameters of the model in question .",
    "we end with a discussion of the practical applications of the tools developed .",
    "the theoretical foundations for the modelling of lightcurves of a star undergoing non - radial pulsations in the linear regime were laid by the pioneering calculations of osaki ( 1971 ) , dziembowski ( 1977 ) , balona & stobie ( 1979 ) , and buta & smith ( 1979 ) . based on the baade - wesselink technique ,",
    "their work exploited the wavelength dependence of a pulsational mode s amplitude and phase and enabled the inference of its degree index @xmath0 based on light and radial velocity observations .",
    "the equations were reformulated by stamford & watson ( 1981 ) and watson ( 1988 ) for use with multi - colour photometric data alone .",
    "their approach proved very convenient for practical purposes , and has been applied to many types of non - radially pulsating stars by a host of different authors .",
    "more recent versions , comparable in scope to the watson method , have been presented by cugier , dziembowski , & pamyatnykh ( 1994 ) , heynderickx , waelkens , & smeyers ( 1994 ) , balona & evers ( 1999 ) , cugier & daszyska ( 2001 ) , and townsend ( 2002 ) .",
    "the latest advancement was proposed by dupret et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and consists of including a detailed discussion of non - adiabatic effects in the optically - thin atmospheric layers .",
    "all of the above treatments model the lightcurves of non - radially pulsating stars in terms of perturbations to the photospheric pressure or surface gravity , the effective temperature and the stellar radius . for cases where temperature effects completely dominate the brightness variations @xmath1 in pulsating white dwarfs for instance",
    "@xmath1 a simpler approach is possible , as was first discussed by robinson , kepler and nather ( 1982 ) and later exploited for zz ceti white dwarfs by brassard , fontaine , & wesemael ( 1995 , hereafter bfw95 ) . for our application to pulsating sdb stars below ,",
    "we mostly follow the presentations of cugier and daszyska ( 2001 ) and townsend ( 2002 ) , but adopt a notation closer to that of bfw95 .",
    "the lagrangian perturbations to the stellar radius @xmath17 , the effective temperature @xmath18 , and surface gravity @xmath19 caused by a single non - radial pulsation may be expressed as @xmath20,\\\\ \\frac{\\delta { t_{\\rm eff}}}{{t_{\\rm eff}}}(\\theta,\\phi , t ) & = & \\re\\left[\\frac{\\delta t}{t^0}y_l^m(\\theta,\\phi)e^{i\\omega t}\\right ] , \\\\",

    "we define the spherical harmonics in terms of the polar angle @xmath32 and the azimuthal angle @xmath33 using the nomenclature of jackson ( 1975 ) as @xmath34 where the associated legendre functions @xmath35 can be generated by the equation @xmath36 with this definition , we may introduce the real quantity @xmath37 which will be useful below and is described in more detail by bfw95 .",
    "the radial components of the complex eigenfunctions may be written as @xmath38 where we have introduced the dimensionless amplitudes ( moduli ) @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 of the complex radial eigenfunctions , as well as their phases @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 with respect to some arbitrary value , which by convention is set to @xmath42 = 0 .",
    "note that the upperscript `` @xmath45 '' indicates the unperturbed value of the variable of interest in the atmospheric layers .    in the watson approach , the brightness variation of a non - radially pulsating star",
    "is calculated by assuming a dependence of the local flux on the local instantaneous effective temperature and surface gravity , and then integrating over the observed disk taking into account the geometry of the mode and the radial distortions involved . as implemented by townsend ( 2002 )",

    "the angles @xmath52 are the angular coordinates of the observer in the spherical coordinate system of the star .",
    "the quantity @xmath53 refers to the specific case of @xmath49 where the degree index @xmath54 .",
    "it is also understood that the derivative of @xmath49 with respect to the effective temperature @xmath55 ( surface gravity @xmath56 ) is taken at constant surface gravity ( effective temperature ) .    in order to simplify equation ( [ eq : townsend ] ) and to enable the eventual elimination of the intrinsic amplitude of the oscillation by taking flux ratios",
    "obtained at different wavelengths , it is necessary to link the radial components of the three eigenfunctions . by convention",
    ", we express the surface gravity and temperature perturbations in terms of the radius eigenfunction . regarding the former , cugier and daszyska ( 2001 ; see also dupret et al .",
    "2003 ) have argued that one may approximate @xmath57 in the limit where the radial gradient of the amplitude of the pressure perturbation ( @xmath58 ) is small .",
    "the real dimensionless quantity @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 where @xmath17 is the stellar radius and @xmath19 is the surface gravity .",
    "given the definition of @xmath61 and @xmath62 in equations ( [ eq : reigenfunction ] ) and ( [ eq : geigenfunction ] ) , the relationship implies that the radius and surface gravity variations occur in phase , i.e. , @xmath63 ( = 0 , by convention ) .",
    "it must be mentioned that equation ( [ eq : delg ] ) differs from the more standard expression employed in the watson approach ( see , e.g. , equation ( 11 ) of cugier et al .",
    "( 1994 ) ) , which suggests @xmath64    in the original theory outlined by stamford and watson ( 1981 ) and watson ( 1988 ) , the coefficient @xmath65 is multiplied by an additional term of order unity denoted by @xmath66 when used in the context of equation ( [ eq : watson ] )",
    ". there has been some debate as to the proper value to adopt for @xmath67 , with some authors ( e.g. , cugier et al .",
    "1994 , balona & evers 1999 , townsend 2002 ) arguing that it should be taken strictly at unity , while most others employ grids of model atmospheres to compute precise values .",
    "regardless of whether or not the @xmath67 quantity is included in equation ( [ eq : watson ] ) , the expression remains considerably different from that recommended by cugier and daszyska ( 2001 ; our equation ( [ eq : delg ] ) ) , particularly when considering long period modes .",
    "the latter is deemed more physical , as it is more consistent with the outer boundary conditions employed during pulsation calculations for a stellar model .",
    "we thus adopt the result of cugier and daszyska ( 2001 ) after verifying that we do indeed find @xmath58 to be mostly flat in the atmospheric layers of our subdwarf b star models ( as discussed below ) .",
    "the radial component of the temperature eigenfunction for its part may be related to the radius perturbation by the expression @xmath68 where we have introduced @xmath69 as the phase lag between the temperature and the radius perturbation . in the adiabatic approximation ,",
    "we set @xmath70 , since maximum temperature occurs at minimum radius for @xmath3-modes . in the non - adiabatic case",
    ", the phase lag can be evaluated using @xmath71}{\\re\\left[\\frac{\\delta t}{t^0}\\right]}\\right)-\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{\\im\\left[\\frac{\\delta r}{r^0}\\right]}{\\re\\left[\\frac{\\delta r}{r^0}\\right]}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath72 $ ] indicates the imaginary part , and @xmath21 $ ] denotes the real part of a complex quantity .",
    "we will apply this relation to detailed non - adiabatic calculations with the aim of modelling @xmath69 as a function of depth , period , and degree index @xmath0 below .    in the standard watson approach ,",
    "it is customary to introduce a second dimensionless real parameter @xmath17 , which measures the departure from adiabacity of the amplitude factor in equation ( [ eq : deltr ] ) , and can hence be defined as @xmath73 it is obvious that , in the adiabatic limit , @xmath17=1 . as for the non - adiabatic case ,",
    "many authors seem to believe that physically acceptable values of @xmath17 are confined to the range @xmath74 .",
    "we beg to differ , since we see no physical reason for @xmath17 not to exceed 1 and , indeed , find no justification for the constraint in the literature . as far as we can see",
    ", it arose primarily from the fact that observations of certain types of pulsating stars ( such as the @xmath9 cephei , @xmath15 scuti and short - period cepheids mentioned by stamford & watson 1981 ) indicated @xmath75 .",
    "while similar values have been recovered computationally for other classes of pulsator ( see , e.g. , townsend 2002 describing slowly pulsating b stars ) , predictions for white dwarfs have yielded @xmath17 values greater than 1 in some cases ( robinson , kepler , & nather , 1982 ) .",
    "this is also what our pulsation calculations indicate for the slowly pulsating subdwarf b stars , as will be decribed in the next section .",
    "the quantities appearing in the denominator of equation ( [ eq : r ] ) can be described by recalling a well - known expression relating the moduli of the temperature perturbation and the radius perturbation under the assumption of adiabacity and the cowling approximation , namely @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the usual adiabatic temperature gradient and @xmath65 is the same coefficient as introduced in equation ( [ eq : watson ] ) . here",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath78 and @xmath79 are real quantities , and the minus sign corresponds to a phase shift of @xmath70 . using this relation together with the definition of @xmath17 , we can reformulate equation ( [ eq : deltr ] ) to yield @xmath80 note that , in practice , the most direct way of computing the relationship between @xmath81 and @xmath61 is to use equation ( [ eq : deltr ] ) , calculating their relative phase @xmath69 from equation ( [ eq : psit ] ) , and evaluating their amplitude ratio using @xmath82\\right)^2+\\left(\\im\\left[\\frac{\\delta t}{t^0}\\right]\\right)^2\\right\\}^{1/2}}{\\left\\{\\left(\\re\\left[\\frac{\\delta r}{r^0}\\right]\\right)^2+\\left(\\im\\left[\\frac{\\delta r}{r^0}\\right]\\right)^2\\right\\}^{1/2}}.\\ ] ] in addition , we then explicitly evaluate the adiabacity parameter @xmath17 using equation ( [ eq : delt ] ) .",
    "this will prove useful in numerical experiments aimed at assessing the impact of non - adiabatic effects on the predicted pulsational amplitudes and phases in different filters , as @xmath69 and @xmath17 can be input directly and set to the adiabatic values for instance .",
    "returning to equation ( [ eq : townsend ] ) , the expression describing the perturbation to the emergent eddington flux , we now seek to reformulate the intensity terms and link them to both the bfw95 and the standard watson ( 1988 ) notation .",
    "it can be shown that the specific intensity term appearing in the temperature perturbation can be related to the monochromatic quantity @xmath83 defined by bfw95 by the expression @xmath84 where , according to equation ( 17 ) of bfw95 , @xmath85 by following the steps described in appendix b of bfw95 , we can re - write equation ( [ eq : tint1 ] ) using the notion of the limb - darkening law @xmath86 as @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 the two last quantities , the logarithmic derivative of the emergent flux with respect to the effective temperature , and the weighted monochromatic limb darkening integral , are familiar notions in the watson model .",
    "it can be seen that , when expressing the intensity term of the temperature perturbation , one has the choice of using a single expression such as the left - hand side of equation ( [ eq : tint ] ) employed by bfw95 or townsend ( 2002 ) , or the splitted terms on the right hand side of the equation favoured in the more traditional implementations of the watson model .",
    "we choose to adopt the latter here in order to facilitate comparisons with the watson approach .",
    "clearly , the specific intensity component of the gravity perturbation in equation ( [ eq : townsend ] ) can be expressed in an equivalent way , yielding @xmath90 with @xmath91 finally , we use the fact that @xmath92 together with the definition of @xmath49 ( equation ( [ eq : ilnu ] ) ) and equation ( [ eq : blnu ] ) to reformulate the specific intensity coefficient in the radius term of equation ( [ eq : townsend ] ) as @xmath93    we can now re - write the perturbation to the relative instantaneous emergent monochromatic eddington flux of equation ( [ eq : townsend ] ) , using equations ( [ eq : delg ] ) , ( [ eq : delt ] ) , ( [ eq : tint ] ) , ( [ eq : gint ] ) and ( [ eq : rint ] ) , as @xmath94,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used the fact that @xmath95 , the inclination angle , in @xmath96 , the real function giving the viewing aspect ( see bfw95 for details ) .    in practice , the last equation will be applied to broadband , rather than monochromatic photometry , so it is necessary to express it in terms of frequency - integrated quantities .",
    "we thus introduce @xmath97 where @xmath98 represents the transmission function for filter @xmath99 , convolved , in principle , with the response of the telescope / detector combination and the atmospheric extinction curve at a given site .",
    "we can now regroup the various components of equation ( [ eq : eddmono ] ) into five terms analogous to those employed in the traditional watson model .",
    "we thus introduce the following short - hand notation : @xmath100 we finally follow koen ( 1998 ) and define @xmath101 which represent the effects on the brightness variation during a pulsation cycle due to effective temperature ( @xmath102 ) and radius / gravity perturbations ( @xmath103 ) respectively . using a trigonometric identity",
    "we may then obtain our final expression for the relative flux in a photometric bandpass @xmath99 arising from the excitation of a single pulsation mode @xmath104 with the wavelength - dependent amplitude given by @xmath105 and the wavelength - dependent phase given by @xmath106 strictly speaking , this expression is valid only for non - rotating stars where the amplitude and phase depend on the radial order @xmath25 and the degree index @xmath0 , but not the azimuthal order @xmath26 .",
    "however , cugier & daszyska ( 2001 ) have argued that it may also be applied to slowly rotating stars , loosely defined as those with a spin parameter @xmath107 ( where @xmath108 is the rotation frequency ) . in this case , the @xmath109 term in the cosine function of equation ( [ eq : amplitude ] ) is replaced by @xmath110 .",
    "the amplitude and phase also become sensitive to the azimuthal index @xmath26 , but only through the period dependence of an @xmath26 component in a rotationally split @xmath111 multiplet .",
    "for fast rotators with higher values of @xmath112 , things become more complicated and a rigorous treatment such as the one developed by townsend ( 2003 ) becomes necessary .    in practice ,",
    "equation ( [ eq : amplitude ] ) is not used directly since it depends on the unknown factor @xmath113 .",
    "instead , we take advantage of the wavelength independence of the latter and eliminate it by calculating the amplitude ratios @xmath114 and phase differences @xmath115 arising from the lightcurves for two different bandpasses @xmath99 and @xmath116 .",
    "mode discrimination can then proceed by exploiting the fact that the wavelength dependence of an oscillation s amplitude and phase may depend strongly on its degree index @xmath0 , and that observational amplitude ratios and phase differences are readily obtainable from multi - colour photometry .",
    "we note that if non - adiabatic effects are neglected in the calculations of the theoretical quantities , then @xmath70 , the phase @xmath117 calculated from equation ( [ eq : phase ] ) will always be zero , and no phase shifts will be predicted between different bandpasses . however , a small or negligible observed phase shift does not necessarily imply the absence of non - adiabatic effects , and one may well encounter situations where the expected phase shifts remain quite small despite important deviations of the adiabacity parameter @xmath17 from its adiabatic value of @xmath118 .",
    "this is the case for our model of a typical ec 14026 star discussed below . on the other hand",
    ", the observed phase shifts will be expected to be negligible if effective temperature perturbations completely dominate the brightness variation and radius / surface gravity effects can safely be ignored ( @xmath119 in the limiting case ) . in that instance , equation ( [ eq : phase ] ) immediately infers @xmath120 irrespective of the bandpass in question .",
    "moreover , the period dependence of the @xmath121 and @xmath122 terms through their common factor @xmath123 cancels out in the calculation of the amplitude ratios , with the result that the latter bear the signature only of the degree index @xmath0 and not the period dependent radial order @xmath25 . by the same logic ,",
    "the amplitude ratios are no longer affected by non - adiabatic effects , a point on which we concur with ramachandran et al .",
    "in retrospect , this alleviates the worry expressed by robinson et al .",
    "( 1982 ) about the legitimacy of using the adiabatic relationship between @xmath81 and @xmath124 in their discussion of colour variations in pulsating white dwarfs ( see also bfw95 ) .",
    "when considering the pulsations of white dwarfs in the linear regime , the brightness variations are completely dominated by temperature effects , which implies an absence of phase shifts between the light curves of different colours , as well as amplitude ratios insensitive to non - adiabatic effects and the period of the mode in question .",
    "the latter then depend only on the degree index @xmath0 , a situation also encountered for high - order @xmath8-modes in our typical pg 1716 star model discussed below .",
    "the quantities required in the theoretical framework discussed above can broadly be divided into three groups : those that can be inferred observationally , those that must be computed on the basis of full stellar models , and finally those that are derived from model atmospheres . in this section",
    "we focus on the latter group , which includes the monochromatic quantities @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 .",
    "since their computation involves not only the standard specific intensities , but also the corresponding derivatives with respect to effective temperature and surface gravity across the visible disk , we needed to modify our model atmosphere code for subdwarf b stars in order to carry out the task efficiently and accurately .",
    "we constructed a grid of model atmospheres defined at 9 gravity points ( log @xmath8 = 4.8 to 6.4 in steps of 0.2 dex ) and 11 temperature points ( @xmath18 = 20,000 to 40,000 k in steps of 2000 k ) representative of the distribution of sdb stars in the @xmath130 plane .",
    "detailed interpolation within this grid enables the calculation of the desired quantities for any given @xmath130 combination .",
    "the model atmospheres are computed under the assumption of lte and uniform composition specified by log @xmath131 = @xmath12.0 , a typical value for sdb s .",
    "metals were not included , since subdwarf b stars are known to be chemically peculiar , and metal abundances vary from one target to the next .",
    "while it could prove interesting to incorporate representative metal abundances and thus assess the importance of metals in this kind of calculation in the future , our h / he lte model grid is quite sufficient for the purposes of this study .",
    "as mentioned above , the colour - amplitude technique is usually applied to broadband photometry , but we find it instructive to first examine the behavior of the key monochromatic quantities .",
    "we begin with the unperturbed emergent eddington flux , which is shown in the top panel of figure 1 in the optical domain for a model with @xmath18 = 33,000 k and log @xmath8 = 5.75 .",
    "these are also the atmospheric parameters we adopt for our representative ec 14026 star model in the next section , where more details are provided .",
    "as is typical for the observed optical spectra of sdb stars , the eddington flux is characterized by the presence of broad hydrogen balmer lines and several weak and narrow helium lines . for comparison",
    ", the middle panel illustrates the predicted first - order perturbation to the emergent eddington flux assuming a nonradial pulsation with a period of 150 s ( a typical low - order @xmath3-mode in an ec 14026 star ) and six values of the degree index from @xmath0 = 0 ( top curve ) to @xmath0 = 5 ( bottom curve ) . note that here",
    ", @xmath132 is divided by the unknown factor @xmath113 .",
    "it is evident that the pulsational amplitude rapidly decreases with increasing @xmath0 , which is a direct manifestation of the well - known geometric cancellation effects associated with an increasing number of nodal lines crisscrossing the visible disk . for values of @xmath0",
    "@xmath133 2 , the decrease of the amplitude with increasing @xmath0 at a given frequency is no longer monotonic , but also depends on the limb - darkening law of the model atmosphere in question in quite a complex way .",
    "the amplitude of the @xmath0 = 4 curve for instance is higher than that of the @xmath0 = 3 curve in the optical domain shown , and the latter dips below the @xmath0 = 5 curve above @xmath7 4000  . by dividing the curves by the unperturbed flux @xmath134 , one obtains the @xmath135 monochromatic amplitude of the assumed mode ( again to within the unknown parameter @xmath136 ) , as indicated in the bottom panel of the figure .",
    "it is the latter quantity that forms the basis of the colour - amplitude technique , which relies on comparing the relative amplitude at two wavelengths in order to eliminate the unknown factor .",
    "the result of such an operation is illustrated in figure 2 , where we have divided the relative monochromatic amplitude curves for each @xmath0 by the corresponding relative amplitude at an ( arbitrary ) frequency point in the continuum with @xmath137 = 3650 @xmath138 . in this particular example , there is little difference between curves with @xmath0 = 0 , 1 , and 2 , however those with @xmath0 = 3 , 4 , and 5 bear a stronger and more dictinct signature of their degree index .",
    "along with the amplitude ratios , the phase differences between the brightness variations at different wavelengths may also be used to infer the degree @xmath0 of a pulsation mode .",
    "this is shown in figure 3 , where we plot the monochromatic phase difference with respect to the spectral point at 3650 @xmath138 for the same assumed pulsation mode with a period of 150 s and @xmath0 values from 0 to 5 as indicated . in our example",
    ", the phase shifts remain relatively small ( less than a few degrees ) over the optical domain .",
    "this implies that , in practice , mode discrimation will be difficult to achieve on the basis of phase differences alone .",
    "the amplitude ratios and phase shifts discussed in the following sections are simply frequency - integrated counterparts to the monochromatic curves pictured in the last two figures . in this context it should be noted that the spikes associated with the central cores of the absorption lines , and in particularly those related to the narrow helium lines , do not significantly contribute to the bandpass integrated quantities .",
    "we would like also to recall that the behaviour of the amplitude ratios and phase shifts with wavelength depends not only on the degree index @xmath0 , but also on the period of the mode and , of course , on the atmospheric parameters of the model in question .",
    "we now evaluate the quantities @xmath17 and @xmath69 through the use of full nonadiabatic pulsation calculations .",
    "to do this , we use the same numerical tools employed earlier by charpinet et al .",

    "this distribution results from the competition between gravitational settling and radiative levitation and has been shown to be responsible for the excitation of low - order @xmath3-modes in models of ec 14026 stars as well as high - order @xmath8-modes in models of pg 1716 stars ( fontaine et al .",
    "2003b ) through the @xmath141-mechanism .",
    "note that , according to the same authors , standard models of sdb stars with uniform metallicity are unable to excite pulsation modes .    in this section",
    "we will focus on a representative model of an ec 14016 star and a pg 1716 pulsator respectively . according to figure 1 of fontaine",
    "et al . ( 2004 ) , which summarizes the location of subdwarf b stars on the h - r diagram , a typical ec 14026 star has log @xmath8 @xmath142 5.75 and @xmath18 @xmath142 33,000 k , which implies that it is significantly denser and hotter than its typical pg 1716 counterpart at log @xmath8 @xmath142 5.40 and @xmath18 @xmath142 27,000 k. we adopt these values , and list some of the models other characteristics , including the two defining variables @xmath139 and @xmath140 in table 1 .",
    "we explicitly give the value of the total radius as well as that of the adiabatic temperature gradient averaged over the atmospheric layers ( see below ) , as both of these quantities enter into our equations . for completeness",
    ", we also provide the value of the quantity @xmath67 evaluated from our model atmosphere grid at the appropriate values of ( @xmath18 , log @xmath8 ) , despite the fact that we do not use that variable in our calculations , since we choose to relate the surface gravity and radius perturbation via the expression developed by cugier @xmath143 daszyska ( 2001 ) .    taking into account the range of periods observed in typical ec 14026 stars , we compute all modes with periods in the range 80@xmath1300 s and with values of @xmath0 from 0 to 5 for our representative short - period pulsator model . for the case of our pg 1716 star model ,",
    "we calculate modes with periods in the range 2000@xmath16000 s and with values of @xmath0 = 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "the first results are illustrated in figures 4 and 5 , where we show the modulus of the radial component of each mode s nonadiabatic pressure eigenfunction as a function of depth in the outermost layers for the ec 14026 and pg 1716 model respectively .",
    "we define the `` atmospheric layers of interest '' as those lying between the optical depths @xmath144 = 0.1 and @xmath144 = 10.0 . it can be seen that about half of the modes considered in the ec 14026 model show small gradients across these layers as is required in the cugier & daszyska ( 2001 ) expression connecting the surface gravity perturbation to the total radius perturbation .",
    "the other modes , which systematically correspond to those with shorter periods , do not strictly pass this test but , lacking a more generally applicable relation , there is little we can do to remedy this shortcoming .",
    "the situation is better for the pg 1716 model , where the vast majority of the modes considered show very small @xmath145 gradients across the atmospheric layers , with the exception of the few modes with the longest periods . as it turns out",
    ", we will find out below that surface gravity perturbations contribute very little to the brightness variations in pulsating sdb stars , which is lucky in the context of our present `` problems '' , as any inaccuracies in the surface gravity perturbations will have little impact on the final results .",
    "figures 6a and 6b show the behaviour of the adiabaticity parameter @xmath17 in the atmospheric layers of our ec 14026 model for all modes of interest .",
    "figures 7a and 7b illustrate similar results for the phase lag @xmath69 .",
    "the figures give the distinct impression that both @xmath17 and @xmath69 depend primarily on the period and very little on the degree index @xmath0 .",
    "this can , in fact , be confirmed quantitatively by computing an `` average '' atmospheric value of both quantities for each mode , and plotting them as functions of the mode s period as shown in figure 8 .",
    "the averaging process used is a simple unweighted integration over all atmospheric layers between @xmath144 = 0.1 and @xmath144 = 10.0 .",
    "we believe that this approach is slightly more rigorous than simply taking the local values at the photosphere itself ( @xmath144 = 2/3 ) .",
    "figure 8 highlights the almost perfect one - to - one relationship that exists between the value of @xmath146 and the period of the mode for the range of interest .",
    "a similar situation is encountered for the averaged quantity @xmath147 . in both cases there",
    "is very little , if any , dependence on the degree index @xmath0 , allowing us to model @xmath146 and @xmath147 as functions of the period @xmath148 in a simple and accurate way ( we drop the subscript `` @xmath149 '' in what follows for a more concise notation ) . while this is not necessary when examining a specific equilibrium model for which individual values can be obtained for each mode ( e.g. , the small circles in figure 8) , the procedure will prove useful in our applications below , where we want to treat the pulsation period as a free continuous variable rather than a discrete eigenvalue .",
    "values of @xmath17 and @xmath69 sufficiently accurate for our needs were obtained by @xmath150-fitting the data points in figure 8 to cubic curves as illustrated .",
    "the cubic solutions are given by @xmath151 and @xmath152 which are formally valid in the period range 80@xmath1300 s and for values of the degree index in the range @xmath0 = 0@xmath15 .",
    "figure 8 reaffirms the well - known fact that non - adiabatic effects are never negligible in stellar atmospheres , but it is the particular dependence of @xmath146 ( and @xmath147 ) on the period that is of central interest here and that can not be ignored in the computations . in future studies , the accuracy of the estimates for @xmath17 and @xmath69 could be further improved by examining the nonadiabatic pulsation equations in the presence of optically thin layers more closely , for example by following the theory of dupret ( 2001 ) and dupret et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "the situation is slightly more complicated for the high - order @xmath8-modes in our representative pg 1716 model , where @xmath17 and @xmath69 depend on both the period @xmath148 and the index @xmath0 as is illustrated in figures 9 and 10 .",
    "the presence of a few trapped modes ( trapped above the h - rich envelope / he core interface ) renders things somewhat more challenging in terms of defining an `` average '' behavior for a pulsation mode .",
    "furthermore , while @xmath147 depends monotonically on the period for a given @xmath0 ( at least in the period range of interest ) , this is not the case for @xmath146 , making it ever more tedious to acceptably fit the data points . as illustrated in figure 11",
    ", we were finally able to find fits to @xmath146 and @xmath147 sufficiently accurate for our present needs by using the following analytic relationships @xmath153 and @xmath154    figure 11 clearly indicates that nonadiabatic effects are important in the atmospheres of pg 1716 stars , and should not be neglected in the computations . as mentioned in the theory section",
    ", the adiabaticity parameter @xmath146 may become larger than 1 for the long period @xmath8-modes characteristic of these objects .",
    "however , as we will see below , temperature variations increasingly dominate the brightness variations in the limit of long periods , causing the @xmath155 effects of a departure from adiabaticity to disappear .",
    "as a representative application , we consider multi - colour photometry in the standard johnson - cousins system @xmath156 . for each reference model",
    "( specified by a value of @xmath18 and a value of log @xmath8 for the model atmosphere calculations ) , we computed the frequency - integrated quantities @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 , where the subscript `` @xmath99 '' denotes one of the wavebands . in our modelling of the effective response curves",
    "@xmath162 , we convolved the standard transmission functions of the @xmath156 filters with the extinction curve of kitt peak national observatory ( representative of sites with 2000@xmath12500 m altitudes ) .",
    "we also assumed a grey response for the instrument / telescope combination .",
    "our values for the frequency - integrated quantities are given in table 2 ( table 3 ) for our reference ec 14026 ( pg 1716 ) star model .",
    "for the former model , we list the values for modes with degree indices in the range @xmath0 = 0@xmath15 , while for the latter they are provided for modes with @xmath0 between 1 and 6 since the case @xmath0 = 0 is of no interest for the long - period variables ( as a rule , the @xmath3-branch period spectra of sdb stars do not reach into the range of the long periods observed in pg 1716 stars ) .",
    "we draw attention to the fact that in both table 2 and table 3 @xmath163 and @xmath164 with only very few exceptions .",
    "this means that the @xmath165 and @xmath166 terms will generally be very small compared to the @xmath121 and @xmath122 terms in the equations discussed in section 2 , implying that in sdb stars the contributions to the brightness variations due to surface gravity perturbations are small compared to the effects of effective temperature perturbations ( @xmath121 and @xmath122 ) and radius changes ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "thus , the exact expression used to relate the surface gravity perturbation to the radius perturbation ( see our discussion of the cugier & daszyska 2001 method versus the more traditional one in section 2 ) is of minor importance for sdb stars .    employing the data listed in tables 1 , 2 , and 3 as well as our polynomial models for @xmath17 and @xmath69 given by equations ( 44 ) through ( 47 ) , we computed amplitudes and phases for a number of modes according to our equations ( 42 ) and ( 43 ) .",
    "the period was treated as a free parameter , which enabled a detailed examination of its influence on the final results . keeping with tradition ,",
    "the amplitudes ratios and phases shifts were calculated with respect to the bluest filter , in this case the @xmath168 bandpass .",
    "the results for our representative ec 14026 star model and those for our pg 1716 model are discussed separately in the following subsections .",
    "we first show , in figure 12 , the ratio @xmath169 as a function of effective wavelength in the five filters considered for three representative periods spanning the range of those observed in a typical ec 14026 pulsator .",
    "all the modes illustrated are associated with degree indices @xmath0 = 0@xmath15 and correspond to low - order @xmath3-modes . excepting the modes with @xmath0 = 1 , for which @xmath167 is always equal to 0 ( see our equation ( 36 ) ) , as well as the @xmath0 = 3 modes in the @xmath170 bandpass , for which the contributions of the effective temperature perturbations are particularly small , the figure infers that both effects ( i.e. , temperature and radius changes ) contribute to the brightness variations in a non - negligible way . unlike for white dwarfs , it is thus not appropriate to assume that temperature effects completely dominate in ec 14026 stars .",
    "while we already mentioned that the @xmath165 and @xmath166 terms usually remain quite small , it is the @xmath167 term , whose numerical value dominates @xmath103 , that becomes appreciable compared to @xmath102 (= @xmath171 ) .    in order to assess the importance of non - adiabatic effects , we repeated the calculation of @xmath169 , this time imposing the adiabatic values @xmath17 = 1 and @xmath69 = @xmath172 for all modes considered .",
    "the results are represented by the dotted lines in figure 12 . keeping in mind the logarithmic scale of the ordinate axis , it is obvious that non - adiabatic effects are significant in the composition of brightness variations in ec 14026 pulsators .",
    "figure 13 shows the expected phase shifts for the same set of modes .",
    "it can be seen that , in the optical domain , the phase shifts depend on the period quite sensitively , while remaining relatively small and reaching a maximum of a few degrees at the most in the period range of interest . in the adiabatic approximation",
    "we expect no phase shifts at all .",
    "this means that , in practice , it will be very difficult to exploit the ( weak ) @xmath0 dependence of such phase shifts .",
    "the situation seems more promising for the amplitude ratios illustrated in figure 14 .",
    "however , while the modes with @xmath0 = 3 , 4 , and 5 bear distinct signatures of their degree index , the capacity to discriminate between modes with @xmath0 = 0 , 1 , and 2 on the basis of optical photometry appears much more limited .",
    "observational amplitude measurements for such modes will have to be unusually precise if they are to be used as mode discriminators in ec 14026 stars .",
    "we would like to point out that non - adiabatic effects on the amplitude ratios are generally non - negligible , as can be deduced by comparing the continuous lines ( non - adiabatic results ) to the dotted lines ( adiabatic values ) in figure 14 .",
    "it may also be worth mentioning that the results depicted in the middle panels of figures 13 and 14 ( the case with @xmath148 = 150 s ) are consistent with the monochromatic results illustrated in figures 2 and 3 , as is to be expected .    in figures 15a and 15b",
    "( separated for visualization purposes ) , we plot the expected amplitude ratios for modes with @xmath148 = 100 s ( dotted lines ) , 150 s ( dashed lines ) , and 200 s ( long - dashed lines ) , with the aim of emphasizing their strong period dependence . in order to compare the results to corresponding period - independent values",
    ", we also include amplitude ratios ( solid lines ) obtained by postulating that effective temperature perturbations completely dominate the brightness variations ( i.e. by setting @xmath103 = 0 in the calculations ) .",
    "as suggested above , it becomes evident that this not a good working assumption for the ec 14026 stars .",
    "finally , in figure 16 , we show the results of a numerical experiment in which we explicitly adopt @xmath167 = 0 in order to assess the relative impact of the @xmath165 and @xmath166 terms on the amplitude ratios .",
    "the resulting period - dependent ratios are indicated by the dotted lines and contrast with the continuous lines corresponding to the period - independent limiting case in which @xmath103 = 0 . while we previously argued that the contributions of the @xmath165 and @xmath166 terms are generally be quite small in pulsating sdb stars",
    ", the figure reveals that non - negligible effects remain for certain cases , especially in the @xmath173 band .",
    "we thus recommend that these terms be kept by in the calculations , particularly since they are readily computable .",
    "the computations for our reference pg 1716 model uncover two distinct regimes as far as the relative importance of the temperature perturbation is concerned . at the lower end of the period range of interest , contributions from both the @xmath102 and @xmath103 terms are significant , whereas the brightness variations are dominated by temperature changes for the longer periods involved .",
    "this can be seen from figures 17a and 17b , where we show the ratio @xmath169 as a function of effective wavelength in a format similar to that of figure 12 . in these and",
    "the following figures , we illustrate our results for six different periods between @xmath148= 2400 s and @xmath148 = 6000 s. comparing figures 17a and 17b clearly reveals that the ratio @xmath169 monotonically increases with period for all filters and degree indices @xmath0 . this is a direct consequence of the the @xmath102 term increasing in absolute value with period via the period - dependent coefficient @xmath65 for the long periods considered , while @xmath167 remains constant for a given filter and degree index .",
    "we recall that modes with @xmath0 = 1 represent a special case , since @xmath167 = 0 in that instance .",
    "this transition from one regime to the other strongly influences the phase shifts and amplitude ratios calculated .",
    "the former are depicted in figures 18a and 18b for the same set of modes as considered above . for the shorter periods we predict significant phases shifts , which reach more than 10 degrees for the 2400 s period . unlike the much smaller phase shifts expected for the ec 14026 stars ,",
    "this is well within achievable measurement accuracy . at the same time",
    ", we find the magnitude of the expected phase shifts to drop very rapidly with increasing period in pg 1716 stars ( note , in particular , the change of the ordinate scale between fig , 18a and fig .",
    "18b ) , to the point where they would not be detected with any confidence for the longer period modes .",
    "the expected amplitude ratios are shown in figures 19a and 19b .",
    "once again , the transition from the period - dependent regime , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are of similar importance , to the period - independent case dominated by effective temperature perturbations is striking .",
    "the plots also emphasize the diminishing importance of nonadiabatic effects with increasing period , as can be seen from the convergence of the dotted ( adiabatic ) and continuous ( non - adiabatic ) lines .",
    "thus , in our pg 1716 model nonadiabatic effects range from extremely significant for @xmath148 = 2400 s to practically negligible for @xmath148 = 6000 s.    in figures 20a and 20b ( separated for visualization purposes ) , we compare the expected amplitude ratios for modes with @xmath148 = 3000 s ( dotted lines ) , 4000 s ( dashed lines ) , 5000 s ( long - dashed lines ) , 6000 s ( dot - dashed lines ) , 7000 s ( dot - long - dashed lines ) , and 8000 s ( dashed - long - dashed lines ) , again with the aim of highlighting the period dependence of the results .",
    "the convergence of the ratios to the period - independent values ( solid lines ) in the limiting case of long periods is recovered nicely .",
    "as before , the period - independent ratios are obtained by assuming that effective temperature perturbations completely dominate the brightness variations ( i.e. , by setting @xmath103 = 0 in the calculations ) .",
    "analogously to the case presented in figure 16 for our ec 14026 model , we carry out supplementary calculations where we explicitly set @xmath167 = 0 in order to assess the relative impact of the @xmath165 and @xmath166 terms on the amplitude ratios .",
    "the results of this numerical experiment are shown in figure 21 .",
    "as in figure 16 , the resulting period - dependent ratios are indicated by dotted lines and are compared to the solid lines representing the period - independent limiting case for which @xmath103 = 0 .",
    "in contrast to the previous plot , the contributions of the @xmath165 and @xmath166 terms are essentially negligible in pg 1716 stars , apart for in the very shortest periods .",
    "for the three longest periods ( not illustrated ) the two curves are not distinguishable .",
    "having discussed the signature of the period and the degree index , as well as that of the different terms contributing to the brightness variations on bandpass - integrated wavelength , we now focus specifically on results expected from the @xmath174 filter combination ( which corresponds to the longest wavelength base in the system used here ) .",
    "figure 22 shows the @xmath170 to @xmath168 amplitude ratio as a function of the degree index @xmath0 on the basis of calculations extending to @xmath0 = 8 . from bottom to top , the various curves correspond to periods with @xmath148 = 2400 , 3000 , 4000 , 5000 , 6000 , 7000 and 8000 s respectively .",
    "the top curve represents an infinite period , to which the finite period curves converge in the limiting case . while evident from previous figures , the peculiar behaviour of the @xmath0=3 and 5 modes is particularly striking here . in practice , these are the modes most likely to be identified from multi - colour photometry , since the amplitude ratios of the remaining modes may not differ enough to the extent where they can be resolved observationally .    finally , figure 23 and 24 respectively show the @xmath175 amplitude ratio and the @xmath176 phase shift expected for our pg 1716 model as a function of period for modes with @xmath0=1 ( black ) , 2 ( grey ) , 3 ( blue ) , 4 ( cyan ) , 5 ( green ) and 6 ( red ) . note that here , the periods illustrated were not considered as free parameters , but are the solution of the eigenvalue problem .",
    "once again , the convergence of values to the period - independent value in the limiting case of long periods is evident .",
    "interestingly , in figure 23 the results for the very shortest periods break with the systematic decrease in amplitude ratio with period , and slightly increase instead .",
    "these same periods are associated with particularly large ( potentially detectable ) phase shifts in figure 24 , however it should be noted that these are shorter than the periods so far observed in pg 1716 stars and of primarily theoretical interest .      in this section ,",
    "we go beyond the two representative subdwarf b star models explored above and discuss the dependence of amplitude ratios and phase differences on the atmospheric parameters @xmath177 and @xmath18 . to this end",
    ", we constructed a sequence of subdwarf b star models parallel to the zero - age extreme horizontal branch , the vital parameters of which are detailed in table 4 .",
    "note that the surface gravity increases with effective temperature , while the thickness of the hydrogen - rich outer layer decreases .",
    "the division between the pg 1716 and ec 14026 regime is based on spectroscopically determined values of @xmath177 and @xmath18 for the two types of pulsator , such as those illustrated in figure 1 of fontaine et al .",
    "in addition to the fundamental parameters , table 4 also gives the approximate period range in which modes are believed to be excited for each model .",
    "for the ec 14026 stars , these correspond to modes that are found to be unstable from our non - adiabatic pulsation calculations , since the latter have been shown to predict the observed period ranges very accurately . note that we have uniformly decreased the iron abundance in our models by a factor of 3 compared to the original `` second - generation '' models , as suggested by fontaine et al .",
    "( 2003b ) . in the case of the pg",
    "1716 stars the situation is more complicated due to the discrepancies that still exist between modelled and observed instability regions ( see our discussion in the introduction ) . we can however constrain the unstable period ranges for the pg 1716 models in our sequence on the basis of the frequencies extracted from long - period variable subdwarfs observed . to date , a quantitative analysis of the period spectrum has been possible for three targets spanning the range of pg 1716 stars in effective temperature : pg 1627 + 017 at @xmath178 23,000 k ( randall et al .",

    "the study of these objects revealed that the width and mode density of the excited period range , as well as the numerical values of the periods themselves , decrease systematically with increasing temperature , enabling us to infer approximate instability bands for all models in our sequence by interpolation of the observed values .",
    "it is these estimated period ranges , rather than precisely modelled quantities , that are given in table 4 .    for each model in the sequence , we computed the necessary model atmosphere parameters in the same bandpasses as used for the representative models for modes with @xmath179 according to their specific @xmath130 combination .",
    "the stellar radius was likewise determined for every model on the basis of its mass and surface gravity , and its characteristic periods were evaluated from pulsation theory in the range of interest . on the other hand",
    ", the remaining three quantities derived from the full stellar models and non - adiabatic pulsation calculations were approximated to the values determined for the appropriate representative model .",
    "thus the values of @xmath180 were taken from table 1 , while @xmath146 and @xmath147 were computed using equations ( 44 ) and ( 45 ) or expressions ( 46 ) and ( 47 ) for the ec 14026 and pg 1716 models respectively .",
    "the resulting accuracy of @xmath146 and @xmath147 is deemed sufficient for the illustrative purposes sought here , however it is understood that for quantitative analyses of observed multi - colour photometry the fitting process outlined in section 4 will have to be repeated for the designated object .",
    "figures 25 and 26 respectively show the phase shifts and amplitude ratios predicted for our sequence of subdwarf b star models from the @xmath176 bandpass combination .",
    "they are illustrated for modes with @xmath0 = 0 ( yellow , ec 14026 stars only ) , @xmath0 = 1 ( black ) , @xmath0 = 2 ( grey ) , @xmath0 = 3 ( blue ) , @xmath0 = 4 ( cyan ) , @xmath0 = 5 ( green ) and @xmath0 = 6 ( red ) . points of different colour are shifted slightly in effective temperature for a given model in order to facilitate viewing and the pg 1716 and ec 14026 domains are separated by the vertical dotted line . from figure 25",
    "we find that the phase shifts predicted are small ( less than 5 degrees ) for the majority of modes in both ec 14026 and pg 1716 stars , and would most likely lie below the detection threshold of multi - colour observations .",
    "larger phase shifts of up to @xmath7 10 degrees are expected for the very shortest periods in the hotter pg 1716 variables , as well as for the @xmath0 = 3 modes at the higher end of the period range excited in the hotter ec 14026 stars .",
    "while it seems plausible that the latter could be detected observationally , the potential for mode discrimination in subdwarf b stars clearly lies with the amplitude ratios depicted in figure 26 . in the case of the pg",
    "1716 stars , the values for modes with @xmath0 = 1 , 2 , 4 or 6 are very similar , but can easily be distinguished from those of @xmath0 = 3 or @xmath0 = 5 modes .",
    "even though the three regimes slowly approach each other with increasing temperature , they remain well separated irrespective of the model in question . in the case of the ec 14026 stars , we identify four distinct groups of modes with @xmath0 = 0 , 1 or 2 , @xmath0 = 3 , @xmath0 = 5 and @xmath0 = 4 or 6 .",
    "again , the influence of the model parameters is relatively small compared to the separation between the domains and becomes vital only when attempting to discriminate between the modes of a given group .",
    "it should be kept in mind that the results depicted in figures 25 and 26 depend not only on the atmospheric parameters of the models in question , but also on the period range excited in each case . as such",
    ", they represent the phase shifts and amplitude ratios predicted in real subdwarf b stars and give a good indication of what would be expected from multi - colour photometry",
    ". however , in terms of a purely theoretical exploration we find it instructive to examine the impact of both the surface gravity and the effective temperature on the amplitude ratios individually . to this end",
    ", we repeated the computation process detailed above for both ec 14026 and pg 1716 stars , keeping the effective temperature ( surface gravity ) constant at the representative value from table 1 , and varying the surface gravity ( effective temperature ) within the ranges found in the sequences of table 4 .",
    "we imposed a representative period of @xmath148 = 150 s for the ec 14026 star domain and @xmath148 = 4500 s for the pg 1716 star regime .",
    "the variation of the amplitude ratio with effective temperature is illustrated in figures 27a and 27b for short- and long - period variable subdwarf b stars respectively ( see the figure captions for more detail ) .",
    "for both types of oscillator , the curves are reminiscent of the amplitude ratios found for our sequence of subdwarf b stars presented in figure 26 , and change gradually and monotonically with temperature .",
    "the situation is more interesting for the variation with surface gravity , depicted in figure 28a ( 28b ) for ec 14026 ( pg 1716 ) models . in the case of the fast oscillators , the amplitude ratios for",
    "most of the modes move in the opposite direction compared to figure 26 , and the closely spaced @xmath0 = 0 , 1 , 2 graphs seem to diverge from the ( constant ) @xmath0 = 1 value as the surface gravity increases . for the pg",
    "1716 models , curves representing modes of different degree indices overlap in several instances , giving rise to a behaviour similar to that encountered as a function of period ( see figure 23 ) .",
    "in this section we demonstrate the potential of the method developed by applying it to published multi - colour photometry . to date , the only sets of multi - colour observations that exist for pulsating subdwarf b stars are those of koen ( 1998 ) , falter et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , jeffery et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and oreiro et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . among these , the jeffery et al .",
    "( 2004 ) data for the fast pulsator kpd 2109 + 4401 yielded the most accurate amplitude estimates . based on three nights of sloan filter ugr photometry with ultracam ( dhillon et al .",
    ", in preparation ) mounted on the 4.2-m william herschel telescope , the authors were able to extract seven periodicities in the 180@xmath1200 s range .",
    "for the purposes of our brief feasibility study , we attempt to determine the degree index of the highest amplitude mode at 182.4 s only .",
    "the first step towards finding the theoretical amplitudes in different wavebands is the calculation of the monochromatic model atmosphere quantities @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 described in section 3 .",
    "since these depend quite sensitively on the atmospheric parameters of the target , they need to be computed for kpd 2109 + 4401 specifically .",
    "we adopt @xmath10=31,380 k and @xmath177=5.65 as derived from our model atmosphere fit to the hydrogen balmer and helium lines present in the time - averaged high - resolution mmt spectrum obtained by betsy green ( private communication )",
    ". these values are part of an ongoing program designed to provide homogeneous estimates of the atmospheric parameters of a large sample of subdwarf b stars , and we refer the interested reader to the forthcoming paper by green , fontaine , @xmath143 chayer ( in preparation ) for more information .",
    "the monochromatic quantities are then integrated over the effective ugr wavebands , computed by convolving the sloan bandpasses with the quantum efficiency curves of the ultracam ccd chips ( vik dhillon , private communication ) and the atmospheric transparency curve of a representative observing site at 2000@xmath13000 m altitude ( in this case kitt peak national observatory ) .",
    "next , we derive the adiabacity parameters @xmath17 and @xmath183 ( section 4 ) for a period of 182.4 s from the non - adiabatic eigenfunctions of an envelope model characterised by the atmospheric parameters given above as well as representative values of @xmath184=0.48 @xmath185 and @xmath186=@xmath14.0 .",
    "we finally calculate the pulsational amplitudes expected from the u , g , and r photometry for degree indices from @xmath0=0 to @xmath0=5 using the equations given in section 2 .",
    "the predicted multi - colour amplitudes are fit to those observed using a @xmath150 minimisation routine following fontaine et al .",
    "compared to the standard normalisation of all amplitudes to one particular waveband this is a more objective way of determining the quality of a match , since the data from all bandpasses are weighted evenly . for every degree index @xmath0 the theoretical amplitudes @xmath187 in each of the three bandpasses i are multiplied by a scale factor @xmath188 , chosen in such a way as to minimise @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the amplitude observed in a given waveband and @xmath191 is the error on the measurement .",
    "the results of this operation for the 182.4-s mode of kpd 2109 + 4401 detected by jeffery et al .",
    "( 2004 ) are illustrated in figure 29 , and the corresponding @xmath150 and quality - of - fit ( q ) values are listed in table 5 .",
    "it is immediately obvious that the data are matched well by the predictions for an @xmath0=0 mode , the theoretical values falling within the ( very small ) error bars in all bandpasses .",
    "the next best fit is that of the @xmath0=1 mode , however the associated @xmath150 residuals are a factor of 30 larger than those for @xmath0=0 .",
    "in fact , if we adopt the canonical notion that a fit can not be considered convincing unless the quality - of - fit @xmath192 ( see , e.g. , press et al .",
    "1986 ) , the theoretical @xmath0=0 mode is the @xmath193 one that can reproduce the observed amplitudes in a satisfactory manner . while this implies an unambiguous identification of the mode s degree index , it should be kept in mind that the estimated @xmath150 and @xmath194 values are sensitive to the formal uncertainties on the observed amplitudes , which may well have been underestimated .",
    "assuming , in an extreme case scenario , that the true errors are twice as large as those calculated by jeffery et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , both @xmath0=0 and @xmath0=1 would provide acceptable fits .",
    "nevertheless , the match for @xmath0=0 remains far superior , and we believe that our identification of the degree index is sound .",
    "we would like to point out that this is the first partial mode identification in a subdwarf b star on the basis of its amplitude - wavelength dependence alone . while the net result  the mode has a degree index of @xmath0=0 ",
    "is the same as that of jeffery et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we were not forced to invoke additional constraints to distinguish modes with @xmath0=0 , 1 , and 2 .",
    "the greater accuracy achieved is undoubtedly due to the fact that we were able to compute a detailed model atmosphere characteristic of kpd 2109 + 4401 specifically , and could incorporate non - adiabatic effects from realistic envelope models .",
    "we have modelled the brightness variations expected across the visible disk during a pulsation cycle for both short- and long - period variable subdwarf b stars taking into account the effects of temperature , radius , and surface gravity perturbations .",
    "the quantities related to the emergent intensity and its derivatives with respect to effective temperature and surface gravity were computed with the aid of a full model atmosphere code specifically modified for this purpose . employing full model atmospheres has led to a degree of self - consistency not often achieved in this kind of calculation for other types of pulsating stars .",
    "for instance , in the case of pulsators near the main sequence most researchers use the kurucz ( 1993 ) model atmospheres ( or their equivalent ) to compute @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "however , since these data do not treat limb darkening , the same authors are forced to turn elsewhere , in particular to the popular tables of wade & rucinski ( 1985 ) , for limb darkening coefficients that allow them to approximately estimate the quantities @xmath159 , @xmath195 , and @xmath196 .",
    "notwithstanding the fact that sdb stars are not main sequence stars , our approach alleviates the uncertainties associated with this mixed procedure .",
    "in contrast to previous studies concerning the potential of multi - colour photometry for mode identification in sdb stars , we were able to model non - adiabatic effects in some detail .",
    "applying full non - adiabatic pulsation calculations to representative ec 14026 and pg 1716 star models showed that these are by no means negligible . in ec 14026 stars , the two parameters measuring the departure from adiabacity of the eigenfunctions in the atmospheric layers of interest ( @xmath146 and @xmath147 ) vary systematically with period , but are independent of the degree index @xmath0 .",
    "this is fortunate as it implies that @xmath146 and @xmath147 can be accurately computed for observed periodicities without assuming any prior knowledge of @xmath0 .",
    "we should mention here that , while we use the fits to @xmath146 and @xmath147 obtained from our respresentative model throughout this explorative study , the latter are sensitive to the atmospheric parameters of the model in question . as such",
    ", they must be computed individually according to the specifications of each target if a quantitative interpretation of the observational data is to be achieved . for the pg",
    "1716 stars , the situation is more complicated as the departure from adiabacity depends on @xmath0 as well as on the period .",
    "the values of @xmath146 and @xmath147 attributed to oscillations observed will therefore constitute only rough estimates , introducing inaccuracies into the amplitude ratios and phase shifts computed .",
    "fortunately , measurements of the longer periods excited in these stars are insensitive to non - adiabatic effects since they are dominated by temperature perturbations and @xmath197 cancel out in the amplitude ratios and phase shifts .",
    "it is of interest to note that our computations return @xmath198 for the majority of modes believed to be excited in long - period variable subdwarf b stars .",
    "although this is in conflict with the prevailing sentiment that @xmath17 must lie in the range @xmath199 , we find no physical justification for this and believe our results to be accurate .    according to our computations ,",
    "the brightness variations observed in subdwarf b stars are caused primarily by temperature and radius perturbations , the contribution of surface gravity changes being small in ec 14026 stars and negligible in pg 1716 stars .",
    "for the latter , temperature effects alone dominate the flux changes in the limit of long periods . in this regime ,",
    "non - adiabatic effects loose their influence on the amplitude ratios and phase shifts , and the period of the mode is no longer an issue . the adiabatic approximation is thus valid in this particular case , which immediately implies that oscillations should occur in phase at all wavelengths .",
    "note however that conversely a lack of observed phase shifts does not automatically justify use of the adiabatic approximation .",
    "even outside the temperature dominated regime , phase shifts are generally predicted to be small , although they may reach up to @xmath7 10 degrees for the shortest periods in pg 1716 stars and certain @xmath0=3 modes in ec 14026 stars .",
    "whereas this may be large enough for an observational detection , it is clear that mode discrimination will occur primarily on the basis of the amplitude ratios .",
    "we note that for main sequence @xmath8-mode oscillators ( e.g. , aerts et al . 2004 or de cat et al . 2005 ) as well as for white dwarfs ( e.g. , robinson et al .",
    "1982 ) the measured phase shifts are negligible .    in the case of the ec 14026 stars , it should be relatively straightforward to distinguish modes with @xmath0 = 0 , 1 , or 2 from those with @xmath0 = 3 , @xmath0 = 4 or 6 and @xmath0 = 5 .",
    "this could well prove invaluable as a consistency check for the `` forward approach '' in asteroseismology , which has been used to claim mode identification in a number of short period variables through the inference of modes with @xmath0 = 0 , 1 , 2 and 3/4 ( e.g. , charpinet et al .",
    "it is interesting to note , in this connection , that the visibility of the @xmath0 = 3 modes in the optical domain is less than that of the @xmath0 = 4 modes ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , very much like the situation in main sequence @xmath3-mode pulsators ( e.g. , heyndericks et al . 1994 ) , and this should be taken into account in future asteroseismological exercises of the sort .",
    "discrimination between modes with @xmath0 = 0 , 1 , or 2 is much more challenging and requires multi - colour photometry of unprecedented quality as well as accurate spectroscopic estimates of the atmospheric parameters for the target observed .",
    "nevertheless , we have demonstrated that it is feasible using the highest amplitude mode detected for kpd 2109 + 4401 ( jeffery et al .",
    "2004 ) as an example .",
    "it is not yet clear whether similar results can be achieved on the basis of other published datasets , or even for the lower - amplitude modes detected in kpd 2109 + 4401 .",
    "this can only be answered through detailed quantitative analyses , which we plan to carry out in the near future .",
    "it will be particularly interesting to see whether we can confirm the tentative mode identifications reported by jeffery et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for the remaining modes detected for kpd 2109 + 4401 and hs 0039 + 4302 .",
    "regardless of the outcome of this project , we feel confident that colour - amplitude ratios and phase shifts could be measured to sufficient accuracy from future observations provided that the targets are bright enough and light curves with well resolved frequency peaks in the fourier domain are obtained .",
    "several consecutive nights on a 4 m - class telescope , or even a single night on an 8 m telescope for a well - chosen `` simple '' pulsator such as pg 1219 + 534 ( see charpinet et al .",
    "2005 ) would likely be adequate .",
    "alternatively , simultaneous ground- and space - based observations would be useful insofar as the frequency baseline could be extented to the uv , where the signature of the degree index on the pulsational amplitude is greater than in the visible domain . given the observing time on the appropriate instrument , it would be interesting to monitor a target for which an asteroseismological analysis has already been completed , and compare the degree indices inferred from the two independent methods .    for the pg 1716 stars , discrimination on the basis of colour - amplitude ratios",
    "seems feasible between modes with degree indices @xmath0 = 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 and those with @xmath0 = 3 and @xmath0 = 5 . to date , the only substantial set of multi - colour photometry for a long - period variable subdwarf consists of the @xmath7 250 hours of simultaneous ( johnson - cousins ) u / r data obtained for pg 1338 + 481 . while detailed results will be presented elsewhere , a preliminary analysis of the photometry indicates amplitude ratios consistent with those predicted for @xmath0 = 1 , 2 , 4 or 6 rather than @xmath0 = 3 or @xmath0 = 5.-mode pulsators with good empirical mode identification all have @xmath0 = 1 . ] compared to the study of ec 14026 stars , that of the pg 1716 stars is still in its infancy , which is partly due to deficiencies in the models , and partly a result of the considerable observational challenges presented by the low amplitudes and long periods of the pulsations .",
    "unambiguous mode identification in these objects will likely be possible only by using a combination of the `` forward approach '' employed for the ec 14026 stars , and inference of the degree index from multi - colour photometry , which we have developed the tools for . in the immediate future",
    "we hope that restricting , if not identifying , the degree index will clarify the current discrepancies between predicted and observed instabilities and pave the way for a more mature understanding of these exciting objects .",
