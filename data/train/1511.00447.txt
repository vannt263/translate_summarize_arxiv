    "the simplest case is when the frequency of light inside an interferometer is determined by an optical atomic transition frequency and the interferometer arm length is allowed to vary freely ( i.e. , allowed to depend on the length of the solid spacer between the mirrors ) . a strontium clock ",

    "if one performs two simultaneous interferometry experiments with two different transition lines , using the same set of mirrors , then one may search for variations of the fundamental constants associated with changes in the atomic transition frequencies : @xmath52 in particular , note that shifts in the arm lengths ( due to variation of the fundamental constants or undesired effects , such as seismic noise or tidal effects ) cancel in eq .",
    "( [ seismic_shield ] )",
    ". we also note that atomic clock transition frequencies may also be compared by locking lasers to the atomic transitions and using phase coherent optical mixing and frequency comb techniques to measure the laser frequency difference / ratio .",

    "the wavelength and arm length ( as well as the size of earth ) have the same dependence on the bohr radius , and so there are no observable effects if changes of the fundamental constants are slow ( adiabatic ) and if the interferometer arm length is allowed to vary freely ( i.e. , allowed to depend on the length of the solid spacer between the mirrors ) .",
    "indeed , this may be viewed as a simple change in the measurement units .",
    "transient effects due to the passage of topological defects may still produce effects , since changes in @xmath9 and @xmath55 may occur at different times .",
    "the sensitivity of laser interferometry to non - transient effects is determined by relativistic corrections , which we estimate as follows .",
