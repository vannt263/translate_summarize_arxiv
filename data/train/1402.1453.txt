    "a very exciting frontier of low - energy neutrino ( @xmath0 ) astronomy is represented by the detection of neutrinos from core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) , whose first and till now only example was provided by sn1987a  @xcite .",
    "existing large underground neutrino detectors ( like superkamiokande or icecube ) as well as numerous planned ones are well suited to detect these rare galactic events ( a few per century _ in average _ ) with sufficiently high - statistics to allow for the extraction of detailed astrophysical information on the sn explosion mechanism  @xcite .",
    "such measurements could also offer a handle on particle physics such as @xmath0 masses and mixings , too  @xcite .",
    "one of the open questions in the neutrino sector is the existence of light sterile neutrino states , motivated by some experimental  anomalies \" .",
    "although a three ( active ) neutrino mixing scenario explains most of the data consistently , some short - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments suggest some deviations . these include the @xmath1 oscillations in lsnd  @xcite and miniboone  @xcite experiments , the @xmath2 and @xmath3 disappearance dubbed reactor anomaly  @xcite in reactor neutrino experiments and the gallium anomaly  @xcite in the calibration of solar neutrino experiments , respectively .",
    "interestingly , a large fraction of these outlier data can be roughly accommodated if a light ( @xmath4ev ) sterile neutrino state is added to the picture ( the so - called @xmath5 model )  @xcite , although tensions between different sets of data persist .",
    "a plethora of experiments , relying on different strategies and methods , are in design or construction phase to check the existence of sterile neutrinos ( see  @xcite and references therein ; see also  @xcite ) .",
    "not surprisingly , the existence of such a sterile state would have an impact on sn neutrino conversions .",
    "recently , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite showed how in such conditions the electron fraction @xmath6 is reduced and the conditions for heavy - element formation in the supernova ejecta can be affected .",
    "it is also clear that the signal detectable at the earth can be altered , see for instance  @xcite for an example associated to the turbulent shock wave .    in this article",
    "we discuss another interesting effect , which has passed almost unnoticed till now .",
    "in particular , the existence of sterile states with properties in the ball - park of what is required by the interpretation of  anomalies \" lead to interesting phenomenological consequences on the _ neutronization burst _ , that should be observable in a large detector of @xmath3 .",
    "the neutronization burst is a prompt burst of @xmath3 associated to the passage of the newly formed shock to regions with densities low enough that neutrinos ( initially trapped ) begin to stream faster than the shock .",
    "since the medium is basically made of free nucleons and is rich in @xmath7 , the only rapid process is @xmath7 captures on @xmath8 : this significantly suppresses the flux of flavors other than @xmath3 , while the @xmath3 signal lasts .",
    "the existence and time profile of this burst are a generic feature of the early signal ( first @xmath9(20 ) ms post - bounce ) of core - collapse sne .",
    "its properties are largely independent of the progenitor and still uncertain physical properties such as the dense matter equation of state ( see for example  @xcite or fig .  1 in  @xcite . )",
    "the detection of such a burst has already been discussed in the literature as a way to establish inverted mass hierarchy ( ih ) in the ( active ) neutrino sector  @xcite , possibly the most robust and spectacular one from sn @xmath0 , provided that an instrument with enough sensitivity is available .",
    "in fact , for the presently measured `` large '' value of @xmath10 , in the neutrino channel maximal @xmath3 conversion occurs for normal hierarchy ( nh ) , while the survival probability is constant and given by @xmath11 for ih ( see e.g.  @xcite for details ) .",
    "note that detectors such as a @xmath12kton liquid argon time projection chamber  of the same class proposed within the context of the laguna collaboration for a future underground detector  @xcite  or a megaton class water cherenkov detector  @xcite , have already been shown to be capable of such a measurement of neutronization burst signal .",
    "this `` unambiguous '' picture is significantly altered in presence of a sterile neutrino with parameters fitting the laboratory anomalies .",
    "notably , to first approximation the existence of sterile neutrino can make the @xmath3 burst signature disappear altogether !",
    "this fact has been mentioned in the past , see e.g.  @xcite , but has never been studied in detail . here",
    "we present a more precise analytical and numerical discussion of this signature : in particular , we identify the region in parameter space where the phenomenon takes place , comparing them to the preferred ones from sterile neutrino explanations of laboratory anomalies . additionally , we present the peculiar alteration in the energy - time double differential flux , highlighting the presence of a delayed `` peak '' appearing for _ kinematical _ reasons , which may be a non - negligible feature for a sufficiently large mixing angle and mass in the sterile sector .",
    "the phenomenological importance of these features for diagnostics both in the active and sterile sector is discussed .",
    "we also study the consequences of assuming more than one non - vanishing angle in the active - sterile sector : this is particularly important for potential signatures in the @xmath13 detection channel , which we briefly address .",
    "this article is structured as follows : the formalism of @xmath5 scenario and discussions about the resonant active - sterile neutrino conversion is reported in sec .",
    "[ formalism ] . in sec .",
    "[ fluxcomp ] we report the sn @xmath3 flux composition in @xmath5 scenario and in sec .  [ sec : flux ] we illustrate the effect of the existence of a sterile neutrino state with typical mixing parameters on representative time - energy double differential sn @xmath0 fluxes .",

    "we shall discuss our results and finally conclude with some perspectives for forthcoming studies .",
    "as a side remark of some technical importance , it is worth pointing out that we checked our analytical results ( which assume factorization and adiabaticity ) with a numerical code which implements the evolution of a @xmath15 system with appropriate parameters in a ( toy ) sn matter potential , which is the generalization of the method described in  @xcite based on the cayley - hamilton formalism .",
    "since we could not find the explicit result in the literature , we worked out the relevant formulae and report them in appendix  [ 4x4ch ] . for completeness , in appendix  [ fluxearth ]",
    "we also report the details of the derivation of our analytical results for the sn @xmath3 and @xmath14 flux compositions outside the sn surface as a function of the input fluxes at the neutrinosphere .",

    "we study in detail the oscillation of neutrinos in @xmath5 scenario in the medium of sne .      before discussing the effect of sterile neutrino on sn flux , in this subsection we summarize some basic information on the neutrino and anti - neutrino sn fluxes .",
    "numerical simulations of core - collapse sne provide the un - oscillated doubly differential neutrino distribution in energy and time , @xmath16 where @xmath17 in the standard notation  @xcite .",
    "this is related to the instantaneous ( time - dependent ) luminosity via @xmath18    we factorize simulation outputs as follows : @xmath19 for each flavor ( @xmath20 ) , where @xmath21 represents the neutrino emission rate ( number of @xmath0 s per unit of time ) with mean neutrino energy @xmath22 .",

    "are all functions of time , and are extracted directly from the simulations .",
    "for definiteness , in this paper we use as benchmark the spherically symmetric garching simulation  @xcite of a @xmath30 progenitor sn from  @xcite , focusing our attention on post - bounce times @xmath31  ms .",
    "figure  [ fig : lum ] shows the time evolution of the luminosity of un - oscillated neutrino and anti - neutrino fluxes at production region given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lum ] ) .",
    "the peak in @xmath3 flux ( the red dashed curve in figure  [ fig : lum ] ) is the neutronization burst .",
    "note that several studies have established that the properties of the neutronization burst are largely independent of the progenitor and still uncertain physical properties such as the dense matter equation of state , and its normalization is so robust that it has even been proposed as a `` standard candle '' for a sn distance determination  @xcite .      in a four - neutrino mixing scheme ( the so - called @xmath5 scenario ) , the flavor neutrino basis is composed of the three active neutrinos @xmath32 and a sterile neutrino @xmath33 .",

    "thus , one can write @xmath43 where the flavor eigenstates are ordered in such a way that if all the mixing angles vanish we have the correspondence @xmath44 , for the nh case among active neutrino . in the limit where the three mixing angles @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) vanish , the above matrix reduces to @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the conventional @xmath49 unitary mixing matrix ( pmns matrix ) among the active neutrinos defined in terms of three rotation angles @xmath50 . in the following we shall assume that @xmath37 is real , and we shall fix the mixing angles entering @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 to the best - fit values from a global analysis of oscillation data  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) @xmath54 for future reference , in the limit of a vanishing @xmath55 one has @xmath56 and @xmath57 and these two matrix elements are independent of @xmath58 and @xmath59 . notice that reactor and gallium anomalies favor a nonzero @xmath55 ; while the lsnd / miniboone anomaly requires both @xmath60 and @xmath61 . the angle @xmath59 is the least constrained active - sterile mixing angle and can be put to zero in the interpretation of anomalies . it is shown in  @xcite that icecube can constrain this angle to a level comparable to the other angles .",
    "the global analysis of the above - mentioned  anomalies \" in @xmath5 scenario leads to the following best - fit values for @xmath55 and @xmath58 mixing angles ( taken from  @xcite ) @xmath62 in the calculations of the rest of this paper , when a nonzero value for active - sterile mixing angles are considered , we use the values of eq .",
    "( [ eq : active - sterile ] ) as the benchmark .",
    "the expressions of transition and survival probabilities @xmath63 are cumbersome but straightforward to obtain analytically in the case of pure vacuum oscillations .",
    "it is well - known ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that for neutrinos propagating out of sn core the vacuum approximation is far from being sufficient , since a relevant role is played by the matter refractive potential in the stellar envelope , which induces the celebrated mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein  ( msw ) effect  @xcite .",
    "note that it has been recently realized that in the deepest sn regions the neutrino density is so high that the neutrino - neutrino interactions  @xcite may dominate the flavor evolution in a highly non - trivial way ( for a review see  @xcite ) .",
    "fascinating ( and hierarchy dependent ) collective phenomena causing coherent conversions with peculiar energy dependences of the type @xmath64 have been uncovered , but we caution the reader that they are only partially understood and have been modeled under a number of simplifications , so that results concerning those effects have to be taken as preliminary .",
    "nonetheless , for the early time signal of interest here such effects are either almost absent in principle , since during the neutronization burst there are small fluxes of antineutrinos or , concerning the slightly longer timescales of few hundreds ms of the accretion phase , they are typically found to be suppressed by multi - angle `` matter '' effects  @xcite , at least for massive enough progenitors .",
    "hence we neglect them in the following .",
    "the evolution of the neutrino state @xmath65 is written in terms of the fluxes at the neutrinosphere ( @xmath66 ) as @xmath67 where the evolution operator @xmath68 depends on the distance @xmath69 traversed in the medium and the medium properties . in terms of @xmath70 , the probability of an initial neutrino of flavor @xmath34 to be in the flavor eigenstate @xmath71 at @xmath69 is then given by @xmath72 . once the flavor composition at the exit of the sn is known , the flux in the mass basis can be simply obtained by inverting eq .",

    "the details of the calculation of the evolution operator , which is used for the numerical resolution of the system , are given in the appendix  [ 4x4ch ] .",
    "they involve a generalization of the method described in  @xcite , with some technicalities worth reporting separately .",
    "although all results we are interested in can be obtained numerically , the basic physics of the flavor conversion leading to active - sterile conversion can be grasped analytically , as we describe in the following . for our purposes",
    ", it suffices to approximate a typical matter density profile as ( for post - bounce times @xmath73  s , see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath74 in the @xmath75 system ( where @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) , the matter potential writes @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the electron and neutron number densities , respectively ; and @xmath81 . in terms of the electron fraction @xmath6 , @xmath82",

    ", the short - baseline experiment hints for sterile neutrinos require @xmath99 ( see also the dashed contours in fig .  [",
    "fig : etos - high ] ) .",
    "so , @xmath100 would imply that all four neutrino states have an absolute mass of the same order of @xmath101 .",
    "this would lead to severe conflict with cosmological bounds  @xcite , and  in a part of the parameter space  also with the direct bound from tritium beta decay  @xcite .",

    "the effect is almost negligible , while in ih case since the main contribution to @xmath196 is from @xmath203 , moderate distortion are more notable .",
    "the next galactic supernova explosion and the observation of its neutrino flux in the existing and forthcoming experiments at earth will provide a unique opportunity to study both the explosion mechanism and neutrino physics .",
    "in this paper we discussed how the existence of a fourth , mostly sterile neutrino state @xmath204 ( heavier than the active ones , the so - called @xmath5 model ) with a @xmath90 mixing characterized by the mixing element @xmath205 would alter the expected @xmath3 sn flux at earth .",
    "obviously , the effect depends on the mass of new state @xmath206 and its mixing @xmath205 .",
    "however , for a wide range of parameter values ( see eqs .",
    "( [ resupp ] ) , ( [ eq : nhrange ] ) , and ( [ eq : ihrange ] ) ) the @xmath3 radiated from the neutrinosphere convert completely to the @xmath204 state en route to the surface of the sn , and hence to the detector at the earth .",
    "since @xmath204 is mostly sterile , this resonant conversion drastically alters the expected early time neutronization @xmath3 burst , making it unobservable at leading order . in more detail , due to the small ( but not necessarily negligible ) mixing @xmath207",
    ", the @xmath204 flux has still a chance to be detectable as @xmath3 on earth .",
    "however , its kinematic characteristics are altered : depending on the mass @xmath206 , energy @xmath103 and the distance of sn to earth , @xmath208 , the @xmath207-proportional @xmath3 flux will be delayed by a time @xmath209 .",
    "we provided an analytical description of the relevant physics , and checked our analytical results ( which assume @xmath210 factorization and adiabaticity of the resonances ) against numerical calculations , finding a good agreement .",
    "the numerical computations were performed with a @xmath211 generalization of the cayley - hamilton formalism described in  @xcite , and we report the relevant formulae in appendix  [ 4x4ch ] .",
    "our main results can be thus summarized as follows : if the mass hierarchy will be unknown at the time of future galactic sn detection , the presence of a fourth sterile state can fake the nh phenomenology ( lack of observable neutronization burst ) even for ih in the active neutrino sector . turning the argument around ,",
    "should the active neutrino hierarchy be determined to be of the ih type , the existence of a sterile state may be one of the simplest explanation for a lack of visible neutronization burst observation from a future sn events in a sufficiently large @xmath3 detector .",
    "this may corroborate independent evidence from the lab , but also be sensitive to mixing values below current constraints . on the other hand ( and perhaps more important ) , the observation of a neutronization peak consistent with expectations for ih would exclude the existence of a sterile state over a much wider parameter space than what required by laboratory anomalies fits , or even the one testable by detectors coming on - line in the near future .",
    "this provides yet another nice example of interplay and complementarity of the astroparticle observables with laboratory ones .",
    "what are the chances that this signature can be actually observed ? in the past decade , there have been dedicated studies concerning the detectability of the neutronization burst with different techniques , see notably  @xcite .",
    "here we just recall the main results , requirements and challenges , addressing the reader to the original literature for details . obviously , the identification of the neutronization burst is especially clean with detectors using the charged - current absorption of @xmath3 s .",
    "the most widely discussed large detector option for this channel is provided by liquid argon , dominantly via @xmath212 .",
    "the study in  @xcite , considering a 70 kton detector , showed that the presence or absence of a neutralization burst leads to a count number of events as different as 86 vs. 41 within the first 240 ms of the signal , for a fiducial sn model located at 10 kpc from us ( note that from within 10 kpc one expects roughly 50% chances to observe the next sn , see for example the distribution in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . even accounting for poisson fluctuations and ( small ) model - to - model variations , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was estimated that a @xmath213 discrimination could be achieved already by this counting test , provided that the distance to the sn is known . needless to say ,",
    "a closer sn could allow a separation even with a smaller detector ( or equivalently to a higher confidence level , for the benchmark case of 70 kton ) , while an uncertainty in the position would worsen the sensitivity .",
    "note however that a more refined test exploiting the _ time structure _ might improve the perspectives for diagnostics .",
    "the other technique that has been investigated concerns large water cherenkov detectors , such as the proposed hyper - kamiokande in japan .",
    "this experimental technique is less clean , since the @xmath3 elastic scattering on electrons has to compete with other large signals from inverse beta decay on protons , reactions on oxygen and @xmath214 scattering onto electrons , but the larger masses ( mton scale ) permit to take advantage of the higher statistics . furthermore , the @xmath3 elastic scattering on electrons are more forward peaked and less energetic than most background events .",
    "the other channels can be most effectively separated if the detector is doped with gadolinium , as suggested in  @xcite and currently tested at the egads facility with encouraging results  @xcite .",
    "accounting for statistical errors , nuclear cross section uncertainties , supernova model dependence ( such as progenitor mass , equation of state ) it was found that the capability of distinguishing the two cases are often better than @xmath215 for a fiducial sn at 10 kpc , and never worse than @xmath213 .    in conclusion , testing for the presence of a conventional neutrino burst in the next galactic sn signal appears within the reach of next generation of underground neutrino detectors , and actually providing a further particle physics motivation to tackle these major experimental enterprises .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that it may be possible to obtain a detection of the neutronization peak already with the currently operating icecube detector at the south pole .",
    "this instrument offers `` only '' a calorimetric light curve via the correlated increase of  cherenkov noise \" in its detectors ( and thus typically via the inverse beta decay reaction ) , but the statistics is so high that fine time structures can be revealed .",
    "it has been shown that in the first 30 ms or so post - bounce ( _ i.e. _ , of emergence of a signal on top of the instrumental noise ) the two scenarios with / without neutralization peak are markedly different , see e.g. fig .  11 in  @xcite .    the observational perspectives for the other signature ( delayed and energy - distorted peak ) remain to be studied .",
    "its detection requires at least comparable performances as for the neutronization peak detection , if not superior , plus some luck in the particle physics parameters , such as relatively large mixing angles and large masses .",
    "energy and timing resolution also play a great role .",
    "one can envisage in fact to optimize specific strategies to exploit the peculiar time - energy correlation , perhaps extending earlier proposals for the `` active neutrino '' mass measurements from sn signals , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "for sure , the detection of the delayed peak would be a very specific signature of this scenario , but a dedicated analysis is needed to explore the observational perspectives in the allowed parameter space .",
    "we note here that other exotic phenomena have been discussed in relation to the prompt neutronization burst : for example , the appearance of the burst in the @xmath13 channel due to magnetic moments  @xcite or neutrino decay  @xcite .",
    "if anything , these possibilities should highlight the importance of large underground detectors for a high - statistics measurement of the neutrino flux(es ) from the next galactic core - collapse sn .    while being probably the most spectacular one , the alteration of the neutronization burst is not the only manifestation of the presence of sterile neutrinos in the expected neutrino fluxes .",
    "we briefly discussed how the antineutrino channel would also be altered , in particular if small mixings of the sterile state with the @xmath135 or @xmath136 are present .",
    "most neutrino detectors use the inverse beta decay reaction for detection and thus are sensitive primarily to @xmath13 , so that this channel may offer a more easily accessible diagnostic tool .",
    "we showed how large ( up to a factor 3 ! ) alterations of the appearance probabilities are induced by the presence of a sterile state .",
    "a natural follow - up of our article would be to study the observational signatures of this channel as well , either in the number , energy and time distribution of events in a water cherenkov detector , say , or in the luminosity profile that can be measured with impressive detail in a detector like icecube .",
    "finally , one might wonder if specific signatures of the kinematical time - delay may be inferred from other techniques than the study of the neutronization burst .",
    "one possible direction would be to consider if alterations of the time variation of the neutrino emissions revealed in simulations ( at ms level , due to anisotropic mass flows in the accretion layer around the newly - formed neutron star ) are detectable , along the lines of the study  @xcite for mass constraints of the active neutrinos .",

    "<S> we study the impact of the existence of an ev - mass scale sterile neutrino  with parameters in the ballpark of what is required to fit the laboratory anomalies  on the early time profile of the electron neutrino and antineutrino fluxes associated to a core - collapse supernova ( sn ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we focus on the universal feature of neutronization burst expected in the first tens of ms of the signal : provided that a detector with sufficient sensitivity is available , it is well - known that in the 3 neutrino framework the detection of the neutronization burst in neutrino channel would signal inverted mass hierarchy . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is dramatically altered in the presence of a sterile neutrino : we study here both analytically and numerically the region in parameter space where this characteristic signal disappears , mimicking normal hierarchy expectations . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , the detection of a peak consistent with expectations for inverted mass hierarchy would exclude the existence of a sterile state over a much wider parameter space than what required by laboratory anomalies fits , or even probed by detectors coming on - line in the near future . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we show the peculiar alteration in the energy - time double differential flux , with a delayed peak appearing for kinematical reasons , which might offer a remarkable signature in case of favorable parameters and for a high statistics detection of a galactic sn . </S>",
    "<S> we also comment on additional potentially interesting effects in the electron antineutrino channel , if more than one angle in the active - sterile sector is non - vanishing . as an ancillary result that we derived in the technical resolution of the equations , in an appendix we report the cayley - hamilton formalism for the evolution of a four neutrino system in matter , generalizing existing results in the literature . </S>"
