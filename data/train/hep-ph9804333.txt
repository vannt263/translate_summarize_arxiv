    "the functions under consideration can generally be written as @xmath4 with five to seven inverse scalar propagators of the form @xmath5 , @xmath6 denoting a loop - momentum and @xmath7 some combination of external 4-momenta .",
    "note that we do not attach an index @xmath8 to the @xmath9 from the feynman prescription since we will choose them all to be equal .",
    "@xmath10 depends on six independent kinematic variables , a possible choice being the mandelstam - variables @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 together with the masses @xmath14 of the four external particles and the condition @xmath15 .",
    "we will , however , need to choose an explicit lorentz frame for our purposes .    when trying to perform one of the integrals using the residue theorem , it is very attractive to first linearize all the propagators @xmath16 with respect to the corresponding variable since this makes the detection of poles particularly simple and does not introduce unnecessary square roots inhibiting further integrations .",
    "due to the signature of the minkowski metric this linearization can easily be done in one pair of variables .",
    "choosing @xmath17 and @xmath18 for linearization and applying the shift @xmath19 a propagator @xmath20 undergoes the transformation @xmath21 this shift can safely be done since the functions defined by topologies ia ) , iia ) , and ib ) - iiib ) converge absolutely as can be seen by counting powers .",
    "closing the contour in the upper half - plane and using the residue theorem to carry out the @xmath17- and @xmath18-integrations , one obtains constraints for the @xmath22- and @xmath23-integrations .",
    "this appearance of constraints is due to the position of poles in the complex @xmath17- and @xmath18-planes either in the upper or the lower half and hence either contributing as a residue or not .",
    "these constraints affect the @xmath22- and @xmath23-integrations only because no other loop - variables appear in the @xmath17-linear term in  ( [ shifteffect ] ) .",
    "we will return to these constraints in the next section .",
    "noticing that the integrations over the variables @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are still unbounded , suggests solving two of them with the residue theorem again . in",
    "@xcite it was shown how the linearization necessary for simplifying this task can be carried out in what we may call the middle variables : @xmath18 , @xmath17 , @xmath26 and @xmath24 .",
    "we will briefly repeat the argument .    as a consequence of conservation of four - momentum , the external legs of any four - point function span a 3-dimensional subspace of momentum - space  the so - called parallel space . using lorentz - invariance ,",
    "its complement  the orthogonal space  can always be chosen to be parallel to the 3-axis .",
    "the 3-components of the loop - momenta do not mix with any external momenta then :    @xmath28    hence the poles of the integrand in the complex @xmath25 , @xmath27 and @xmath29-planes respectively are all located in the first and third quadrant .    at this stage one can make contact to the case of a general @xmath2-point function . for @xmath3 the 3-components do mix with external momenta .",
    "but the very fact that @xmath3 ensures that _ after _ undertaking appropriate partial fraction in the propagators the convergence of all integrals is sufficiently strong so that termwise linear shifts are allowed which erase the appearance of external momenta in the 3-components of all quadratic propagators .    the observation that the poles of the integrand are in the first and third quadrant ( together with the fact that the integrand falls off sufficiently rapidly at large @xmath25 , @xmath27 and @xmath30 ) suggests that we should try to rotate clockwise by @xmath31 and effectively change the metrics from the usual minkowski metric @xmath32 to @xmath33 in order to be able to linearize the integrand in @xmath24 and @xmath26 .",
    "the mixed propagator @xmath34 , however , seems to spoil this project since its roots in the complex @xmath27- or @xmath25-plane alone are not bound to the first and third quadrant . in order to do the rotation",
    ", we have to treat @xmath25 , @xmath27 and @xmath35 on the same footing .",
    "due to the integrand s symmetry we can restrict our attention to the first quadrant in the @xmath27-@xmath25-plane : @xmath36 now we reparametrize this quadrant by substituting @xmath37 and @xmath38 : @xmath39 here , @xmath13 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are all positive so the propagators have their poles in the first and third quadrant of the complex @xmath42-plane . this allows us to close the contour of @xmath42-integration around the fourth quadrant , with the jacobian picking up a sign : @xmath43 inverting the above transformations we are left with the identity @xmath44 note that this flip in the sign of metric is not related to the standard wick rotation  @xcite where an appropriate analytic continuation has to be applied at the end of calculation in order to obtain the greens function for arbitrary exterior momenta .",
    "the flip  ( [ kreimertrafo ] ) is a simple analytical formula not for our case only but for any loop - component belonging to orthogonal space . in particular ,",
    "we are not allowed to set the imaginary part in the propagators to zero .",
    "now we are in a position to complete the linearization of our propagators in the middle variables @xmath18 , @xmath17 , @xmath26 and @xmath24 by applying the shifts @xmath45 in addition to  ( [ shiftone ] ) .",
    "next we interchange the order of integration in order to apply the residue theorem to the four middle variables first .",
    "recall that we are allowed to interchange the order of integration for our graphs because the integral over the modulus of their integrand exist .",
    "as mentioned above , the sign of the linear coefficient of the variable being integrated ( @xmath17 in  ( [ shifteffect ] ) ) determines whether the pole is inside or outside the contour .",
    "we therefore obtain a sum of residues each having a heaviside function constraining the domain of integration of the edge variables @xmath23 , @xmath22 , @xmath27 and @xmath25 arising at each integration of the middle variables .",
    "at each integration , we expect to obtain one residue for each propagator containing the integration - variable .",
    "the potential proliferation of terms is , however , drastically reduced by two different kinds of relations holding among them as we show next .",
    "the first relation is a well - known corollary to the residue theorem ( see e.g.  @xcite ) :    the sum of the residues of a rational function ( including a possible residue at infinity ) is zero .",
    "therefore we can express one of the remaining residues after each integration by the sum of all the other ones . in our case",
    "we apply this to a product of inverse propagators linear in an integration - variable @xmath6 : @xmath46 , with @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 containing the remaining mass- and momentum - terms .",
    "we are allowed to drop one term and only keep its @xmath50-function : @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the zero of @xmath53 . since",
    "this collecting can be done in four consecutive integrations , one can reduce the number of terms for the planar box - function from 108 to 36 .",
    "the second relation holding among the terms is a consequence of the consecutive integration in @xmath17 and @xmath24 and can be stated as follows :    consider the term obtained by evaluating first the residue at the pole @xmath54 due to @xmath53 in the @xmath17-integration and then the residue at the pole @xmath55 due to @xmath56 ( with @xmath54 inserted ) in the @xmath24-integration .",
    "it differs from the one obtained by first calculating the residue due to @xmath56 and then to @xmath53 ( with @xmath57 inserted ) by a sign only .    to prove it , we write the inverse propagators as @xmath58 and note that the locations of poles @xmath54 , @xmath57 , @xmath59 and @xmath55 are obtained by solving a linear system @xmath60 hence the two orders of integration amount to the two ways of solving such a system : first solving the first line and inserting it into the second or vice versa .",
    "the solutions inserted into the remaining @xmath61 are therefore the same : @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "this , however , specifies only proportionality in our second lemma .",
    "the proportionality - constant @xmath64 can readily be obtained by writing down the residual term after evaluating the @xmath65-order : @xmath66}=\\frac{1}{(\\beta_{i1}\\beta_{j2 } - \\beta_{j1}\\beta_{i2})\\,p_{l , q}|_{l_1^{(i)},l_2^{(j)}}\\cdots},\\ ] ] which is antisymmetric in @xmath8 and @xmath67 .    in the planar case , lemma 2",
    "can always be applied twice to restrict the number of individual terms by a factor 4 . for the topology we thus end up with 9 terms .",
    "one can further see that the coefficients of the middle variables in @xmath16 are generated by subsequent multiplication of terms linear in the edge variables ( the @xmath68 in  ( [ lemmatwosystem ] ) are linear in edge variables according to  ( [ shifteffect ] ) ) and can therefore be factorized when inserted in the heaviside functions .",
    "therefore the domains of integration in the edge variables are always bounded by a number of linear hypersurfaces .",
    "e.g.  when we perform the @xmath24-integration for a scattering - amplitude of type and apply lemma 1 on all the resulting residues , we obtain the infinite domains sketched on the left of figure  [ fig : bounds1 ] .",
    "( the signs denote the weight of the integrand there and stems from the numerator in  ( [ boxkorollar3 ] ) ) . after the @xmath26-integration we obtain the domain in the middle and",
    "when multiplied , only a finite triangle in the @xmath27-@xmath25-plane remains .    performing the @xmath17- and the @xmath18-integrations in the same way we encounter poles on the real axis .",
    "they are , however , purely artificial and a consequence of choosing equal imaginary parts @xmath9 in all propagators . treating the integral as a cauchy principal value integral",
    ", the residue theorem can still be applied in these cases since there are only odd coefficients in the integrand s laurent - series but the residue contributes only with a weight @xmath69 instead of @xmath70  @xcite .    when this procedure is continued and all the constraints are combined applying both lemmata , we get the 6 domains of integration in the @xmath23-@xmath22-plane shown in figure  [ fig : bounds2 ] for a    scattering - amplitude .",
    "( there are only 6 domains remaining instead of 9 due to an incompatibility of constraints after the @xmath24- and the @xmath26-integrations in 3 of them . )",
    "the exact parameters of the borders of these domains depend on @xmath27 and @xmath25 .",
    "we emphasize again , that the resulting domains of integration in the edge variables are always finite and bounded by linear functions  even in the case of crossed topologies  thus making them accessible to an unambiguous reparametrization and subsequent next integration . in the case of crossed topologies ,",
    "lemma 2 can be applicable more than twice because of the presence of two mixed propagators .",
    "the numbers of remaining terms turn out to be 12 in and 5 in .",
    "the procedure outlined above produces a 4-fold integration of rational function over a finite volume in the edge variables : @xmath71 the appearance of a numerator containing integration variables is due to the solutions of @xmath72 with respect to middle variables inserted into the remaining propagators .",
    "after partial - fractioning this integrand can always be transformed into one , where @xmath73 is no more than quadratic in the edge variables .",
    "the integration - domains in the @xmath23-@xmath22-plane which depend on @xmath27 and @xmath25 can be mapped into some fixed domain independent of @xmath27 and @xmath25 using a suitable linear transformation .",
    "the rational function can then be integrated once more , resulting in other rational functions , logarithms and arcustangens where care has to be taken of the small imaginary part and the position of branch - cuts .",
    "the coefficients of the result will generally involve square roots of quartic functions in the remaining three variables .",
    "this three - dimensional integration should be accessible to numerical evaluation using ` vegas `  @xcite or similar routines .",
    "we will now test our method on a simple example : a decay - amplitude of type where a heavy scalar particle decays into a lighter and two massless ones as shown in figure  [ fig : acnodeeggp ] .",
    "the choice of momentum - flow indicated there results in the inverse propagators @xmath74    [ fig : acnodeeggp ]    the most convenient lorentz frame for this case turns out not to be the rest - frame of the decaying particle but the one in which the 3-momenta of the light - like particles are antiparallel and aligned to a specific coordinate - axis , say @xmath75 .",
    "this frame can always be reached by a lorentz transformation as long as the two light - like particles do not have equal momenta .",
    "when integrating out the middle variables with these conditions and applying the rules found in section  [ sec : constraints ] one finds , however , incompatible constraints in the @xmath17- and the @xmath18-integrations . to get out of the dilemma , the light - cone condition for the two massless external particles must be temporarily relaxed .",
    "a possible choice of momenta is @xmath76 where @xmath77 is tacitly assumed .",
    "now the integrations in the middle variables can be performed resulting in the domain of figure  [ fig : bounds3 ] for the @xmath23- and the @xmath22-integrations in addition to the one already known from figure  [ fig : bounds1 ] for the @xmath27- and @xmath25-integrations .",
    "if we use a linear transformation in the @xmath23-@xmath22-plane in order to map this domain into a unit - square @xmath78 , @xmath79 , another one to map the triangle in the @xmath27-@xmath25-plane into a unit - triangle @xmath80 , @xmath81 , the limit @xmath82 can safely be performed and we obtain the representation @xmath83 where the coefficients are given by @xmath84 in this case , all terms quadratic in @xmath85 or @xmath86 in the denominator have canceled , allowing for an integration in both of these variables .",
    "splitting the integral into principal value integral and @xmath87-function separates real- and imaginary part .",
    "we obtain a numerically stable two - fold representation with dilogarithms in the real part and logarithms in the imaginary part which displays the correct behaviour even at thresholds .    by letting @xmath88 we restrict our kinematical regime even further and",
    "obtain a two - point sunset - topology with two propagators squared .",
    "numerical stability , however , breaks down as we approach this limit .",
    "a look at the arguments of the dilogarithms in our two - dimensional representation expanded in small @xmath89 reveals why : @xmath90 the coefficients in this formula are @xmath91 with @xmath92 as the only combination of exterior momenta ( c.f .",
    "( [ extmomenta ] ) ) entering @xmath93 , as it should be .",
    "numerical stability can be restored in  ( [ sunsetexpand ] ) if the expansion of the dilogarithms at their branch - point as generalized taylor series @xmath94 and the relation @xmath95 are used .",
    "we compare this with numerical results obtained via another method  @xcite and find agreement below and above threshold ( figure  [ fig : twoptlim ] ) .",

    "<S> we describe a first attempt to calculate scalar 2-loop box - functions with arbitrary internal masses , applying a novel method proposed in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> four of the eight integrals are accessible to integration by means of the residue theorem , leaving a rational function in the remaining variables . </S>",
    "<S> the result of the procedure is a three- or sometimes two - dimensional integral representation over a finite volume that can be further evaluated using numerical methods .    </S>",
    "<S> the study of higher - loop quantum corrections in qfts is accompanied by rapidly increasing computational challenges . while in pure qed e.g.the presence of only one mass scale allows relative high loop orders to be evaluated  @xcite , the feasibility of loop calculations in the general case with arbitrary internal masses has up to now been cut off at the two - loop level .    in recent years </S>",
    "<S> much work has been done on two - loop integrals with arbitrary internal masses of the self - energy- and vertex - type . </S>",
    "<S> these functions could be reduced to double integrals with manageable numerical behaviour  @xcite ( c.f .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for another approach at these diagrams ) . </S>",
    "<S> not much seems to be known , however , about the different two - loop corrections to scattering - amplitudes ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : functions ] ) involving arbitrary - mass propagators which will become of some importance for probing new physics in @xmath0-processes or in a muon - collider , for example . </S>",
    "<S> some of these topologies factorize into products of one - loop functions , i.e.   no propagator shares both loop - momenta . </S>",
    "<S> others are one - loop functions containing other one - loop functions as subtopologies ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : functions ] , third column ) . rather than analyzing all of these functions , </S>",
    "<S> we focus our attention on five four - point topologies . </S>",
    "<S> they are all obtained by shrinking propagators in the two basic four - point topologies and . </S>",
    "<S> two of them are of crossed type where two propagators share both loop - momenta ( first column ) and three of planar type ( second column ) . </S>",
    "<S> there is no striking difference to the graphs in the third column . </S>",
    "<S> for example the first graph in the first row , third column relates to the graph in the second row , second column if we shrink the appropriate propagator .    </S>",
    "<S> the importance of the four point function derives not only from the fact that it describes the first scattering amplitude ( 2 @xmath1 2 ) , but also from the fact that the multiparticle scattering amplitudes , involving @xmath2-point functions , @xmath3 , are closely related to the four point functions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we will see below how this relation emerges in our method at the two - loop level .    </S>",
    "<S> the idea behind our method is to perform four of the integrals with cauchy s residue theorem and evaluate at least one of the remaining ones analytically , leaving a two- or three - dimensional representation for numerical evaluation .    </S>",
    "<S> this article is organized as follows : in the first two sections we describe how one can generally perform four integrations with the residue theorem alone and analyze the structure of the result . in the remaining sections we will complete the calculation for a graph of type in a special kinematic case , always keeping in mind the more general graphs , notably and as we go along . in section  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : example ] we look at some of the results and discuss what possible problems we need to be concerned with in some limiting kinematical regimes . </S>"
