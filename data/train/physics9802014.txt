    "in a number of branches of physics , mean field theory gives a remarkably effective approximation to the ground state .",
    "similarly , for the response of the system to small perturbations , time - dependent mean field theory is a useful extension .",
    "this is the experience in nuclear physics@xcite , atomic and molecular physics@xcite and condensed matter physics@xcite .",
    "there are of course intrinsic limitations to these approximations , but equally pressing is the large computational resources required for calculations of systems of interest .",
    "this is our motivation to look for algorithms that better match the computational effort to the intrinsic limits of the approximation .",
    "we take our inspiration from the lanczos algorithm @xcite , which is best known in many - body physics for extracting low - lying eigenstates of very large hamiltonian matrices@xcite .",
    "when dealing with large spaces , the computational question often comes down to the number of times the hamiltonian operates on a state vector .",
    "depending on the hamiltonian and the starting vector , the lanczos algorithm is able to extract an accurate ground state vector in a basis of @xmath2 states with a few hundred hamiltonian operations .",
    "the algorithm may be viewed as a numerically stable technique@xcite to compute moments of the hamiltonian with respect to some initial state @xmath3 , that is , @xmath4 for large @xmath5 , @xmath6 is dominated by the extremal eigenvalues @xcite , which are thus available for recovery .",
    "the lanczos algorithm has also been applied to many other topics in atomic , molecular , solid state , and nuclear physics , including computation of the s - matrix @xcite , time - evolution of wave packets @xcite , level densities @xcite , and the continued - fraction expansion of the resolvant or green s function @xcite . particularly relevant to us is the application to strength functions .",
    "the strength function @xmath7 for an operator @xmath8 on a state @xmath9 is defined @xmath10 a powerful technique to calculate the strength function , successfully applied to the nuclear shell model @xcite , uses the lanczos algorithm with a starting vector @xmath11 .",
    "the lanczos algorithm implicitly computes the moments @xmath12 of the strength function .",
    "after a few tens of iterations one can accurately reconstruct the distribution of the exact strength function .    in many cases , however , the matrix elements of the operator @xmath8 are sensitive to correlations in the ground state , and then the size of the wave function basis in the straightforward hamiltonian approach becomes problematic .",
    "in this situation , the time - dependent mean - field theory offers a reasonable compromise .",
    "the small amplitude theory , the rpa or linear response , can be cast into a matrix form in a particle - hole basis .",
    "however , the rpa matrix is not symmetric as required by the lanczos algorithm .",
    "the matrix equation is commonly written as ( ) ( ) =( ) [ rpa ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are particle - hole hamiltonian matrices , @xmath15 is the eigenfrequency , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the vectors of positive- and negative - frequency particle - hole amplitudes , respectively .",
    "an important property of the rpa equation is that eigenvectors come in conjugate pairs : in equation ( [ rpa ] ) @xmath18 is also an eigenvector with eigenfrequency @xmath19 .",
    "for the linear response , the matrix element between the rpa ground state @xmath20 and an excited state @xmath21 may be expressed as |q|0= ( , ) ( ) where @xmath22 is the vector of particle - hole matrix elements and the vector @xmath23 is normalized as @xmath24    there are a number of ways to introduce a lanczos - type algorithm for the rpa matrix .",
    "the method we describe here has the advantages that it preserves the form eq.([rpa ] ) of the rpa matrix and it produces strength functions that respect sum rules .",
    "we seek a new basis of vectors @xmath25 where the matrices of column vectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 transform the rpa matrix as @xmath28 where the transformed matrices @xmath29 and @xmath30 are now tridiagonal : @xmath31    the lanczos basis vectors and matrix elements are generated iteratively as follows .",
    "suppose we have the vectors @xmath32 already computed , together with the transformed matrix up to @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the iteration starts by applying the rpa matrix in eqn .",
    "( [ rpa ] ) to the vector @xmath35 , |z_t= ( ) = ( ) the diagonal elements @xmath36 and @xmath37 are now easily computed : @xmath38 we next project out @xmath39 , the component of @xmath40 that is orthogonal to the space @xmath32 .",
    "this can be done conveniently by using the matrix elements in ( [ transformedmatrix ] ) that have already been calculated , |z_t= ( ) = + ( ) the norm of the vector @xmath39 is then computed as = _ t_t-_t _",
    "t the norm can be negative , and the definition of the new vector @xmath41 depends on the sign .",
    "in fact , because we are actually doing _",
    "block_-lanczos , implicitly operating not only on the vector@xmath42 but also its rpa conjugate @xmath43 simultaneously , there is a degree of freedom , corresponding to a hyperbolic rotation , in choosing the new vector .",
    "the simplest choice for the vectors and corresponding rpa matrix elements is      in analogy with the application to strength functions in the nuclear shell model , we start with the vector given by |z_1= ( ) = ( ) ; with such a starting vector the algorithm manifestly preserves the energy - weighted sum rules : @xmath44 using the eigenvector representation of the rpa matrix , one can show @xmath45 with our method the @xmath46-th iterate respects the odd-@xmath5 sum rules for @xmath47 .",
    "we now illustrate the method with a very simple model , a collective particle - hole interaction fragmented by single - particle energies .",
    "we consider states @xmath48 with matrix elements @xmath49 and @xmath50 . here",
    "@xmath51 represents the energy spacing of the particle - hole configurations , @xmath52 is the strength of the collective coupling to the field @xmath53 , and the components of the vector @xmath54 , where the @xmath55 are gaussian distributed random amplitudes , and normalize @xmath56 .",
    "the factor @xmath57 weights the collective response towards the middle of the excitation spectrum . the parameter @xmath52 should be positive for a repulsive collective interaction such as the coulomb that generates plasmons .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the strength function for such an rpa matrix in a space of 500 states , with parameter values given in the caption .",
    "the parameters were chosen to obtain moderate collectivity , with a strong but broadly - fragmented collective excitation distributed over the spectrum .",
    "1 also displays the @xmath46=3 , 10 , and 50 approximants to the strength function , where @xmath46 is the number of lanczos vectors @xmath58 , or , equivalently , the number of multiplications with the rpa matrix .",
    "one sees that with a handful of states , one state closely approximates the collective excitation and the others distribute themselves over the remaining spectrum . a better way to see",
    "the convergence of the strength function is to plot its integral , @xmath59 .",
    "this is shown in fig . 2 for @xmath46=3 and 10 .",
    "after 50 iterations the integral of the strength function is virtually indistinguishable from the exact solution .",
    "we mention that the algorithm does not explicitly preserve the total strength @xmath60 . if there were no correlations in the ground state , that is ,",
    "if the vectors @xmath61 all vanished , then the total strength would be @xmath62 .",
    "the non - trivial deviations from 1 in our examples are related to the amount of correlations in the ground state .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "3 , which is the integrated strength function for a model identical to that in figs .  1,2 except that the collective interaction is attractive rather than repulsive . here",
    "the total strength is about 3.7 , i.e. quite different from 1 .",
    "3 illustrates how with @xmath633 and 10 the total approximate strength converges rapidly to the exact value .",
    "( in the repulsive model of fig .  2",
    "the total strength had already converged by @xmath64 . )",
    "although we can not prove this rapid convergence in all cases , it seems likely in light of the strong constraints imposed by the odd-@xmath5 sum rules .",
    "we anticipate that the algorithm will be particularly useful in problems which require a single - particle dimensionality of the order of tens or hundreds of thousands , but which allow a sparse matrix approximation for the hamiltonian , such as the local density approximation .",
    "this applies to molecular and condensed matter physics modeled with the kohn - sham equations , and to nuclear physics for excitations in deformed nuclei@xcite . with the lda hamiltonian",
    ", an efficient particle - hole representation can be constructed from the orbital representation of holes and the coordinate - space representation of particles@xcite .",
    "the computational difficulty for the basic matrix - vector multiplication then scales as the number of particles @xmath0 and the dimensionality of the single - particle space @xmath65 as @xmath66 .",
    "only a fixed number of these operations , of the order of ten , are needed to obtain the strength function to the accuracy of the fundamental mean field approximation .",
    "thus the overall scaling of the method is @xmath1 .",
    "this study arose in the program at the institute for nuclear theory , `` numerical methods for strongly interacting quantum systems '' , and we wish to thank j. carlson and r. wiringa for providing that forum .",
    "also thanks k. yabana for many discussions .",
