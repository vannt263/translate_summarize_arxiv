    "with the discovery of the first inorganic spin - peierls compound cugeo@xmath1,@xcite it has become possible to investigate the physics of the spin - peierls transition in quasi - one - dimensional spin chains with high precision . as a consequence , it has attracted much attention both in experiment and theory . yet , for a long time the absence of a soft phonon mode @xcite has been puzzling , since the behavior was believed not to be consistent with the standard approach to spin - peierls transitions by cross and fisher.@xcite the frequencies of the peierls - active phonon modes being of the order of the magnetic exchange,@xcite it has been argued that the cross and fisher approach is not applicable because of the nonadiabacity of the phonons.@xcite only recently we were able to show@xcite that the random - phase - approximation ( rpa ) approach by cross and fisher indeed is consistent with the hardening of the peierls - active phonon modes.@xcite    it is now tempting to combine the rpa results with the detailed data on the phonons acquired by braden _",

    "the latter has been subject to various experimental @xcite and theoretical studies.@xcite    the microscopic three - dimensional ( 3d ) hamiltonian we have to consider consists of three parts : @xmath3 the heisenberg spin hamiltonian @xmath4 with the exchange integrals @xmath2 and @xmath5 between nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) cu @xmath6 orbitals , respectively .",
