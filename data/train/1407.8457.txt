    "since the nobel prize winning first observation of bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in 1995 @xcite , the investigation of this new state of matter has become one of the most active areas of contemporary research .",
    "a bec , first predicted theoretically by einstein for non - interacting particles in 1925 , is a peculiar gaseous state that particles of integer spin ( bosons ) occupy a macroscopic quantum state .",
    "let @xmath5 be the time variable and @xmath6 be the position vector of @xmath3 particles in @xmath7 , then , naively , bec means that , up to a phase factor solely depending on @xmath8 the @xmath3-body wave function @xmath9 satisfies @xmath10for some one particle state @xmath11 that is , every particle takes the same quantum state .",
    "equivalently , there is the penrose - onsager formulation of bec : if we let @xmath12 be the @xmath13-particle marginal densities associated with @xmath14 by @xmath15then bec equivalently means @xmath16it is widely believed that the cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls)@xmath17where @xmath18 is the laplacian @xmath19 or the hermite operator @xmath20 , fully describes the one particle state @xmath21 in ( [ formula : bec state ] ) , also called the condensate wave function since it characterizes the whole condensate .",
    "such a belief is one of the main motivations for studying the cubic nls . here , the nonlinear term @xmath22 represents a strong on - site interaction taken as a mean - field approximation of the pair interactions between the particles : a repelling interaction gives a positive @xmath23 while an attractive interaction yields a @xmath24 .",
    "gross and pitaevskii proposed such a description of the many - body effect .",
    "thus the cubic nls is also called the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "because the cubic nls is a phenomenological mean - field type equation , naturally , its validity has to be established rigorously from the many - body system which it is supposed to characterize .    in a series of works @xcite",
    ", it has been proven rigorously that , for a repelling interaction potential with suitable assumptions , relation holds , moreover , the one - particle state @xmath21 solves the defocusing cubic nls ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "it is then natural to ask if bec happens ( whether relation holds ) when we have attractive interparticle interactions and if the condensate wave function @xmath21 satisfies a focusing cubic nls ( @xmath24 ) if relation does hold . in contemporary experiments ,",
    "both positive khaykovich , streker and negative @xcite results exist . to present the mathematical interpretations of the experiments , we adopt the notation @xmath26and investigate the procedure of laboratory experiments of bec subject to attractive interactions according to @xcite .",
    "* confine a large number of bosons , whose interactions are originally _ repelling _ , inside a trap .",
    "reduce the temperature of the system so that the many - body system reaches its ground state .",
    "it is expected that this ground state is a bec state / factorized state .",
    "this step then corresponds to the following mathematical problem : + [ problem : lieb]show that if @xmath27 is the ground state of the n - body hamiltonian @xmath28 defined by@xmath29where @xmath30 , then the marginal densities @xmath31 associated with @xmath27 , defined in ( e : marginal ) , satisfy relation . + here , the quadratic potential @xmath32 stands for the trapping since @xcite and many other experiments of bec use the harmonic trap and measure the strength of the trap with @xmath33 .",
    "we use @xmath34 to denote the trapping strength in the @xmath35 direction and @xmath36 to denote the trapping strength in the @xmath37 direction as we will explain later that , at the moment , in order to have a bec with attractive interaction , either experimentally or mathematically , it is important to have @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , we denote @xmath39the interaction potential .",
    "case solely . for @xmath40",
    "( hartree dynamic ) , see frolich , e - y1,knowlesandpickl , rodnianskiandschlein , michelangelischlein , gmm1,gmm2,chen2ndorder , ammari2,ammari1,lchen . ] on the one hand , @xmath41 is an approximation of the identity as @xmath42 and hence matches the gross - pitaevskii description that the many - body effect should be modeled by an on - site strong self interaction . on the other hand ,",
    "the extra @xmath43 is to make sure that the gross - pitaevskii scaling condition is satisfied .",
    "this step is exactly the same as the preparation of the experiments with repelling interactions and satisfactory answers to problem [ problem : lieb ] have been given in @xcite .",
    "* use the property of feshbach resonance , strengthen the trap ( increase @xmath44or @xmath36 ) to make the interaction attractive and observe the evolution of the many - body system .",
    "this technique continuously controls the sign and the size of the interaction in a certain range . and @xmath45 .",
    "] the system is then time dependent . in order to observe bec , the factorized structure obtained in step",
    "a must be preserved in time . assuming this to be the case , we then reset the time so that @xmath46 represents the point at which this feshbach resonance phase is complete .",
    "the subsequent evolution should then be governed by a focusing time - dependent @xmath3-body schrdinger equation with an attractive pair interaction @xmath45 subject to an asymptotically factorized initial datum .",
    "the confining strengths are different from step a as well and we denote them by @xmath47 and @xmath48 . a mathematically precise statement is the following : + [ problem : ours]let @xmath49 be the solution to the @xmath50 schrdinger equation@xmath51where @xmath52 with @xmath27 from step a as initial datum . prove that the marginal densities @xmath53 associated with @xmath49 satisfies relation . , @xmath54 , one could not expect that @xmath55 the ground state of ( [ hamiltonian : step a ] ) , is close to the ground state of ( [ hamiltonian : step b ] ) . ]    in the experiment @xcite by cornell and wieman s group ( the jila group ) , once the interaction is tuned attractive , the condensate suddenly shrinks to below the resolution limit , then after @xmath56 , the many - body system blows up .",
    "that is , there is",
    "no bec once the interaction becomes attractive .",
    "moreover , there is no condensate wave function due to the absence of the condensate .",
    "whence , the current  nls theory , which is about the condensate wave function when there is a condensate , can not explain this @xmath57 of time or the blow up .",
    "this is currently an open problem in the study of quantum many systems .",
    "the jila group later conducted finer experiments @xcite and remarked on @xcite that these are simple systems with dramatic behavior and this behavior is providing puzzling results when mean - field theory is tested against them .    in @xcite ,",
    "the particles are confined in a strongly anisotropic cigar - shape trap to simulate a 1d system .",
    "that is , @xmath58 @xmath48 . in this case , the experiment is a success in the sense that one obtains a persistent bec after the interaction is switched to attractive .",
    "moreover , a soliton is observed in @xcite and a soliton train is observed in @xcite .",
    "the solitons in khaykovich , streker have different motion patterns .",
    "in paper i @xcite , we have studied the simplified 1d version of ( [ hamiltonian : step b ] ) as a model case and derived the 1d focusing cubic nls from it . in the present paper ,",
    "we consider the full 3d problem of ( hamiltonian : step b ) as in the experiments @xcite : we take @xmath59 and let @xmath60 in ( hamiltonian : step b ) .",
    "we derive rigorously the 1d cubic focusing nls directly from a real 3d quantum many - body system . here , `` directly '' means that we are not passing through any 3d cubic nls .",
    "on the one hand , one infers from the experiment @xcite that not only it is very difficult to prove the 3d focusing nls as the mean - field limit of a 3d focusing quantum many - body dynamic , such a limit also may not be true .",
    "on the other hand , the route which first derives @xmath61as a @xmath62 limit , from the 3d @xmath3-body dynamic , and then considers the @xmath63 limit of , corresponds to the iterated limit ( @xmath64 ) of the @xmath3-body dynamic , i.e. the 1d focusing cubic nls coming from such a path approximates the 3d focusing @xmath3-body dynamic when @xmath33 is large and @xmath3 is infinity ( if not substantially larger than @xmath33 ) . in experiments , it is fully possible to have @xmath3 and @xmath33 comparable to each other .",
    "in fact , @xmath3 is about @xmath65 and @xmath33 is about @xmath66 in @xcite .",
    "moreover , as seen in the experiment @xcite , even if @xmath47 is one digit larger than @xmath48 , negative result persists if @xmath3 is three digits larger than @xmath47 .",
    "thus , in this paper , we derive rigorously the 1d focusing cubic nls as the double limit ( @xmath67 ) of a real focusing 3d quantum @xmath3-body dynamic directly , without passing through any 3d cubic nls .",
    "furthermore , the interaction between the two parameters @xmath3 and @xmath33 plays a central role . to be specific , we establish the following theorem .

    "this exactly matches the gross - pitaevskii theory that the many - body effect should be modeled by a strong on - site self - interaction . therefore , for the mathematical justification of the gross - pitaevskii theory , it is of particular interest to prove theorems [ theorem:3d->2d bec ( nonsmooth ) ] and [ theorem:3d->2d bec ] for self - interaction ( @xmath139 .",
    "a main tool used to prove theorem [ theorem:3d->2d bec ] is the analysis of the bbgky hierarchy of @xmath140 as @xmath141 in the classical setting , deriving mean - field type equations by studying the limit of the bbgky hierarchy was proposed by kac and demonstrated by landford s work on the boltzmann equation . in the quantum setting , the usage of the bbgky hierarchy was suggested by spohn @xcite and has been proven to be successful by elgart , erds , schlein , and yau in their fundamental papers @xcite which rigorously derives the 3d cubic defocusing nls from a 3d quantum many - body dynamic with repulsive pair interactions and no trapping .",

    "\\label{equation : gross - pitaevskii hiearchy without a trap}\\]]in another part , they show that hierarchy has a unique solution which is therefore a completely factorized state . however , the uniqueness theory for hierarchy is surprisingly delicate due to the fact that it is a system of infinitely many coupled equations over an unbounded number of variables . in @xcite , by assuming a space - time bound on the limit of @xmath142 , klainerman and machedon gave another uniqueness theorem regarding ( [ equation : gross - pitaevskii hiearchy without a trap ] ) through a collapsing estimate originating from the multilinear strichartz estimates and a board game argument inspired by the feynman graph argument in @xcite .",
    "the method by klainerman and machedon @xcite was taken up by kirkpatrick , schlein , and staffilani @xcite , who derived the 2d cubic defocusing nls from the 2d quantum many - body dynamic ; by chen and pavlovi @xcite , who considered the 1d and 2d 3-body repelling interaction problem ; by x.c .",

    "the first main part is the proof of the needed focusing energy estimate , stated and proved as theorem [ theorem : energy estimate ] in  section : energyestimate .",
    "the main difficulty in establishing the energy estimate is understanding the interplay between two parameters @xmath3 and @xmath33 . on the one hand , as suggested by the experiments cornish , jila2,khaykovich , streker , in order to have to a bec in this focusing setting , one has to explore `` the 1d feature '' of the 3d focusing @xmath3-body hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian:3d to 1d n - body unscaled ] ) which comes from a large @xmath33 . at the same time",
    ", an @xmath3 too large would allow the 3d effect to dominate , and one has to avoid this .",
    "this suggests that an inequality of the form @xmath153 is a natural requirement . on the other hand , according to the uncertainty principle , in 3d , as the @xmath35-component of the particles position becomes more and more determined to be @xmath154 , the @xmath35-component of the momentum and thus the energy must blow up .",
    "hence the energy of the system is dominated by its @xmath35-directional part which is in fact infinity as @xmath63 .",
    "since the particles are interacting via 3d potential , to avoid the excessive @xmath35-directional energy being transferred to the @xmath155 direction , during the @xmath156 process , @xmath33 can not be too large either .",
