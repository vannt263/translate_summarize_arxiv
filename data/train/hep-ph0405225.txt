    "nucleon spin functions represent a sensitive tool for understanding the nucleon internal structure in the language of qcd . up to this day",
    "we have accumulated a very good knowledge of the nucleon spin functions @xmath0  and @xmath1 , which were measured in deep inelastic scattering @xcite -her2 .",
    "a further important and interesting quark spin distribution function is the transversity , the third non - diagonal element of the quark spin density matrix .",
    "transversity is not accessible from the measuring of deep inelastic scattering , since it corresponds to the helicity flip amplitude .",
    "its measuring is more complicated and that is the reason , why some more accurate and complete experimental data on the transversity are still missing .",
    "however , the recent and/or future data from the experiments hermes ( desy - hamburg ) , clas ( jlab ) , compass ( cern - geneva ) and rhic ( brookhaven national laboratory ) could be interpreted also in terms of the transversity @xcite -@xcite . for the present status of research in both theory and experiment , see e.g. @xcite  and overview barone .    in refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite the probabilistic , covariant quark - parton model ( qpm ) , in which intrinsic quark motion with spheric symmetry is consistently taken into account , was developed by one of us ( p.z . ) .",
    "it was shown that such a model nicely reproduces some well - known sum rules and gives a very reasonable agreement with experimental data on the spin structure functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "assuming @xmath2 symmetry , a calculation was done from the input on unpolarized valence quark distributions @xmath3 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend this model also for description and calculation of the transversity distribution .",
    "first , let us shortly summarize , how the spin structure functions @xmath4 were calculated in the paper @xcite . the antisymmetric part of the tensor related to the photon absorption by a single quark reads:@xmath5where @xmath6 are the photon momentum , quark mass and polarization vector ; the corresponding handbag diagram is in fig .",
    "then it was shown that the corresponding tensor related to the target ( proton ) consisting of quasifree quarks can be written as@xmath7where @xmath8 is the proton mass , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the quark and proton momenta .",
    "the distribution @xmath11 is the difference of the quark distributions with opposite spin projections . in the proton",
    "rest frame one can write@xmath12for the time being , if not stated otherwise , we consider the quark charge equals unity .",
    "further , we showed that the covariant form of the quark polarization vector reads@xmath13where @xmath14 is the proton polarization vector and@xmath15finally , in the last step the functions @xmath16 were extracted from the tensor ( [ cr17 ] ) . in the approximation @xmath17and identifying the beam direction with coordinate 1 in the proton rest frame , we obtain    @xmath18    which implies@xmath19since@xmath20the @xmath21 function allows a useful alternative representation of @xmath22 :    @xmath23    let us also remark that in the paper @xcite we showed that a similar approach for the corresponding symmetric part of the proton tensor gives the unpolarized structure function@xmath24    now , if one assumes the same spheric shape of the distributions @xmath25 for both opposite polarizations , then the corresponding probabilities can be parameterized as@xmath26so for @xmath27 we have a pure state with the polarization @xmath28 .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath2 we have @xmath29 for @xmath30 quarks .",
    "the last relations imply@xmath31so the relations ( [ tt4 ] ) - ( [ tt5 ] ) can be rewritten as@xmath32    here , in the same approach , we shall try to calculate the transversity .",
    "generally , transversity may be related to the auxiliary polarized process described by the interference of vector and scalar currents @xcite , ik , so that the respective quark tensor carries only one lorentz index .",
    "the simplest handbag diagram in fig .",
    "[ fg1]b corresponds to the expression@xmath33which will be used instead of the tensor ( [ tt1 ] ) . in the next step",
    "we integrate this vector equally as the tensor in ( [ cr17 ] ) . here",
    "we assume for the time being , that due to rotational symmetry in the proton rest frame , the transversity distribution is generated by the same function @xmath11 as that in the case of the longitudinal one : @xmath34obviously only the terms @xmath35 from the vector ( cr15 ) contribute here , i.e.,@xmath36now we take the proton rest frame and assume@xmath37then  one can check that only @xmath38,@xmath39further , if we again assume approximation ( [ tt2a ] ) , then @xmath40and@xmath41so now we shall try to identify the transversity with the dimensionless function@xmath42if we use the alternative notation@xmath43then combination of the relations ( [ tt8 ] ) and ( [ tt9a ] ) assuming @xmath44 gives@xmath45note that for the first moments , assuming the validity of the burkhardt - cottingham sum rule , this implies @xmath46further , using the wanzura - wilczek @xcite relation , which was proved for our @xmath16 in @xcite , @xmath47the rule ( [ ma9 ] )  can be represented as@xmath48moreover , in the same paper we suggested the relations between the spin functions and valence quark distributions:@xmath49 , \\qquad g_{2}^{q}(x)=\\frac{\\cos \\eta _ { q}}{2}\\left [ -\\allowbreak \\allowbreak q_{v}(x)+3x^{2}\\int_{x}^{1}\\frac{q_{v}(y)}{y^{3}}dy% \\right ] ; \\qquad q = u , d ,   \\label{t83}\\]]which imply@xmath50so now one can calculate @xmath51 either using experimental input on @xmath52 or from some fit on the valence distribution @xmath3 . in fig .",
    "fg2 we show transversities calculated with the use of formulae ( [ mc9 ] ) and ( [ t84 ] ) .",
    "the spin functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 are here extracted from the parameterization of the world data on the proton spin function @xmath0@xcite assuming the @xmath2 approach ,   @xmath55for the valence functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 we use the parametrization obtained by the standard global analysis in @xcite .",
    "all the parameterizations are taken for @xmath58 .",
    "the reason why in this figure the ( dashed ) curve based on the experimental input on @xmath0 is above the ( solid ) curve calculated from fitted @xmath3 , can be the same , as it was discussed in @xcite directly for the @xmath0 .",
    "now we check if the obtained transversities satisfy the soffer inequality @xcite:@xmath59after inserting @xmath60 from the relations ( [ n8]),(tt10),([tt8 ] ) we get@xmath61and after rearranging the r.h.s .",
    "one obtains@xmath62which means that@xmath63which is apparently correct for @xmath64 .",
    "further , since@xmath65we have also@xmath66which means that the transversity sign is controlled only by the sign of @xmath67 , which is determined by the sign of @xmath68 .",
    "so in our @xmath2 approach the inequality ( [ n17 ] ) is safely satisfied for @xmath69quarks .",
    "now let us consider negative @xmath51 , for @xmath70quarks in the @xmath2 approach , when @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    ". then the combination of eq .",
    "( [ n8 ] ) and relation ( n17 ) gives@xmath73which is obviously valid .",
    "so in the @xmath2 approach the soffer inequality is satisfied for both @xmath74 and @xmath75 quarks .",
    "however , let us now consider rather extreme case when @xmath76 . relation ( [ n17 ] ) for the angle @xmath77 reads@xmath78which contradicts the inequality ( [ tt12 ] ) , so in this limit also the transversity ( [ n8 ] ) contradicts the soffer inequality .",
    "the reason is in the assumption that transversity is generated by the same function @xmath79 as the spin functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting transversity contradicts the soffer inequality in the case of large negative quark polarization",
    ". indeed , inequality ( [ tb84 ] ) means that @xmath80 can not exceed @xmath81 . at the same time , large negative polarization takes place for @xmath76 ; then @xmath82 becomes small , while @xmath83 is large ( and negative ) .",
    "below we shall modify the transversity definition as follows .",
    "the structure functions are proportional ( see e.g. @xcite ) to the combinations of amplitudes:@xmath84@xmath85@xmath86now , in our approach we identify@xmath87where @xmath88 are the distributions in relations ( [ tt7 ] ) , from which the structure functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 are constructed in eqs .",
    "( [ tt8])@xmath91([tt10 ] ) .",
    "but what about the remaining interference function@xmath92which we are going to insert into eq . ( [ n8 ] ) instead of @xmath93 ?",
    "the @xmath94  is a new function , which has no definite relation to the functions @xmath25 .",

    "@xmath99 is substituted by @xmath100 . ]",
    "one gets for both extremes @xmath101so the inequality is satisfied for any transversity @xmath83 in the band @xmath102 given by eq .",
    "( [ tt23 ] ) with _ any _ @xmath103 .",
    "in fact , two inequalities are now satisfied : @xmath104and in this way we have shown that taking into account the interference nature of the transversity at the stage of parton - hadron transition is quite substantial for general compliance with the soffer inequality .",
    "obviously , nothing can be said about saturation of the inequality@xmath105 within this simple approach .",
    "concerning the sign of the transversity @xmath106 , let us note , that now there is no simple correspondence with the sign of @xmath107 .    since the relations ( [ n8 ] ) and ( [ tt23 ] ) differ only in the @xmath108 dependent factor ahead of the integral , the relations ( [ ma9]),([mc9 ] ) and ( [ t84 ] ) imply for the second approach@xmath109@xmath110    this approach for the transversity is compared with the previous one in fig .",
    "[ fg3 ] , again assuming @xmath2 approximation for contributions from @xmath74 and @xmath75 valence quarks .",
    "however , one should point out that curves corresponding to the second approach represent only upper limits @xmath111 for transversities , in the sense of the relation ( [ tz24 ] ) .",
    "the left part of the figure shows results for @xmath75-quarks .",
    "the relations ( tx24 ) _ - dashed _ and ( [ ty24 ] ) _ - solid _ curves are compared with those in fig .",
    "[ fg2 ] , calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ mc9]),([t84 ] ) .",
    "it follows , that curves of the second approach are enhanced by the factor @xmath112 @xmath113 with respect to the first one .",
    "the right part of the figure demonstrates similar curves for @xmath114quarks , but since @xmath115 @xmath116 both the corresponding pairs of curves are equal up to sign .",
    "so only the second pair is displayed .",
    "the dotted curves in both parts represent tranversities calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite in the lo and evolved from the initial scale @xmath117 to @xmath118 .",
    "obviously , our results are well compatible with them .",
    "further , let us analyze the relation@xmath119obviously , its saturation is equivalent to the equality in relation ( tt24 ) , which takes place either for @xmath120 ( pure state of the quark with polarization + ) or for static quarks ( @xmath121 ) . on the other hand , in the limit @xmath122 and with the use of eq .",
    "( [ t83 ] ) one can write @xmath123 = \\cos ^{2}\\left ( \\eta _ { q}/2\\right ) \\cdot q_{v}(x)-x^{2}\\cos \\eta _",
    "{ q}\\int_{x}^{1}% \\frac{q_{v}(y)}{y^{3}}dy .",
    "\\label{t25}\\ ] ]    in this way , both sides of relation ( [ tu24 ] ) are displayed in fig .",
    "it is seen that particularly the transversity of @xmath75-quarks in this approach is constrained considerably more than only by the soffer bound @xmath124 .",
    "the relationship between both bounds depends on @xmath99 .",
    "one can check that@xmath125which in the @xmath2  approach gives fractions @xmath126 and @xmath127 for @xmath74 and @xmath75 quarks .",
    "the covariant qpm , which takes into account intrinsic quark motion , was generalized to involve the transversity distribution .",
    "two ways of generalization were considered :    \\1 ) the interference effects were assumed on a quark level only ( interference of vector and scalar currents produce the quark trace with one lorentz index ) and the generic quark polarized distribution @xmath128 was assumed the same as that for the structure functions @xmath0  and @xmath1 .",
    "we derived the relation between the transversity @xmath51 and the usual polarized distribution @xmath107 , which implies that the resulting transversity is roughly twice as large as the usual distribution function .",
    "we discussed the compatibility of the obtained transversity with the soffer inequality and we have found that the inequality is violated in the case of large negative quark polarization .",
    "\\2 ) in the second approach we accounted also for interference effects at the quark - hadron transition stage , which is formally represented by the interference sum ( [ tta18 ] ) . in this approach , assuming the validity of soffer inequality at the stage of parton - hadron transition ( [ ttc18 ] ) , we obtained a new bound on the transversity , rather than the transversity in itself .",
    "this bound is more strict , than the soffer one . roughly speaking",
    ", the new bound is more restrictive for quarks with a greater proportion of intrinsic motion and/or smaller ( or negative ) portion in the resulting polarization .    for both approaches , with the use of the obtained sum rules ,",
    "we have done the numeric calculations , in which either experimentally measured spin function @xmath129 or the valence quark distributions @xmath130 were used as an input . to conclude , in general our calculations suggest that the quark intrinsic motion plays an important role for the spin functions - including the transversity ."
