    "recently , brain rhythms in health and disease have attracted much attention @xcite .",
    "particularly , we are concerned about fast sparsely synchronized brain rhythms which are related to diverse cognitive functions ( e.g. , sensory perception , feature integration , selective attention , and memory formation ) @xcite . at the population level",
    ", synchronous small - amplitude fast oscillations ( e.g. , gamma rhythm ( 30 - 100 hz ) during awake behaving states and rapid eye movement sleep and sharp - wave ripple ( 100 - 200 hz ) during quiet sleep and awake immobility ) have been observed in local field potential recordings , while at the cellular level individual neuronal recordings have been found to exhibit stochastic and intermittent spike discharges like geiger counters @xcite .",
    "thus , single - cell firing activity differs distinctly from the population oscillatory behavior .",
    "we note that these sparsely synchronized rhythms are in contrast to fully synchronized rhythms where individual neurons fire regularly at the population frequency like the clocks .",
    "brunel et al .",
    "developed a framework appropriate for description of fast sparse synchronization @xcite . under the condition of strong external noise , suprathreshold spiking neurons discharge irregular firings as geiger counters , and then the population state becomes unsynchronized",
    "however , as the inhibitory recurrent feedback becomes sufficiently strong , this asynchronous state may be destabilized , and then a synchronous population state with stochastic and intermittent individual discharges emerges .",
    "thus , under the balance between strong external excitation and strong recurrent inhibition , fast sparse synchronization was found to occur in both random networks @xcite and globally - coupled networks @xcite .    in brain networks ,",
    "architecture of synaptic connections has been found to have complex topology ( e.g. , small - worldness and scale - freeness ) which is neither regular nor completely random @xcite . in our recent work @xcite , as a complex network we employed the watts - strogatz model for small - world networks which interpolates between regular lattice with high clustering and random graph with short path length via rewiring @xcite .",
    "the watts - strogatz model may be regarded as a cluster - friendly extension of the random network by reconciling the six degrees of separation ( small - worldness ) @xcite with the circle of friends ( clustering ) .",
    "we investigated the effect of small - world connectivity on emergence of fast sparsely synchronized rhythms by varying the rewiring probability from short - range to long - range connection @xcite . when passing a small critical value of the rewiring parameter",
    ", fast sparsely synchronized population rhythms were found to emerge in small - world networks with predominantly local connections and rare long - range connections .",
    "we note that these small - world networks as well as random graphs are statistically homogeneous because their degree distributions show bell - shaped ones .",
    "however , brain networks have been found to show power - law degree distributions ( i.e. , scale - free property ) in the rat hippocampal networks @xcite and the human cortical functional network @xcite .",
    "moreover , robustness against simulated lesions of mammalian cortical anatomical networks @xcite has also been found to be most similar to that of a scale - free network ( sfn ) @xcite .",
    "this type of sfns are inhomogeneous ones with a few `` hubs '' ( superconnected nodes ) , in contrast to statistically homogeneous networks such as random graphs and small - world networks @xcite .",
    "many recent works on various subjects of neurodynamics have been done in sfns with a few percent of hub neurons with an exceptionally large number of connections @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of our study is to extend previous works on sparse synchronization in statistically homogeneous networks @xcite to the case of inhomogeneous sfns with a few superconnected hubs .",
    "we first consider a directed version of the barabsi - albert sfn model with symmetric preferential attachment with the same in- and out - degrees ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "@xcite , and study emergence of sparsely synchronized rhythms by varying @xmath0 ( synaptic inhibition strength ) and @xmath1 ( noise intensity ) for a fixed attachment degree @xmath10 in an inhibitory population of fast spiking ( fs ) izhikevich interneurons @xcite .",
    "fast sparsely synchronized rhythms are found to appear for large values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . for a sufficiently large fixed value of @xmath0",
    ", we make an intensive investigation of the population states by increasing @xmath1 . for small @xmath1 , full synchronization with the same population - rhythm frequency @xmath2 and mean firing rate ( mfr )",
    "@xmath3 of individual neurons occurs . for this case , all the individual neurons exhibit the same behavior , independently of inhomogeneous network structure .",
    "as @xmath1 passes a lower threshold @xmath11 , a transition to partial synchronization with @xmath4 ( @xmath5 : ensemble - averaged mfr ) appears due to intermittent discharge of individual neurons . with increasing from @xmath11 , difference between @xmath2 and @xmath12 increases , and sparse synchronization with @xmath6",
    "emerges when passing a higher threshold @xmath13 . for the case of partial and sparse synchronization ,",
    "mfrs of individual neurons vary depending on their degrees .",
    "as @xmath1 is further increased and eventually passes a critical value @xmath7 , a transition to unsynchronization occurs due to destructive role of noise to spoil the pacing between sparse spikes .",
    "the critical value @xmath7 for the transition to unsynchronization is determined by employing a realistic `` thermodynamic '' order parameter , based on the instantaneous population spike rates ( ipsr ) @xcite .",
    "it is also shown that for @xmath8 , population synchronization emerges in the whole population because the spatial correlation length between the neuronal pairs covers the whole system . furthermore , the degree of the population synchronization is also measured in terms of two types of realistic `` statistical - mechanical '' measures , based on ( 1 ) the occupation and the pacing degrees of the spikes and ( 2 ) the correlations between the ipsr and the instantaneous individual spike rates @xcite . only for the partial and sparse synchronization , contributions of individual neurons to population synchronization change depending on their degrees , unlike the case of full synchronization .",
    "consequently , individual neuronal dynamics reveal the inhomogeneous network structure for the case of partial and sparse synchronization , which is in contrast to the case of statistically homogeneous random graphs and small - world networks . as a next step",
    ", we also investigate the effect of network architecture on sparse synchronization for fixed values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the following three cases : ( 1 ) variation in the degree of symmetric attachment ( 2 ) asymmetric preferential attachment of new nodes with different in- and out - degrees ( 3 ) preferential attachment between pre - existing nodes ( without addition of new nodes ) . as the degree @xmath10 of symmetric preferential attachment in the first case of network architecture",
    "is increased , both the average path length @xmath14 and the betweenness centralization @xmath15 decrease , which results in increased efficiency of communication between nodes .",
    "consequently , the degree of sparse synchronization becomes higher . on the other hand , with increasing @xmath10",
    "the axon `` wire length '' of the network also increases . at an optimal degree @xmath16 ,",
    "there is a trade - off between the population synchronization and the wiring economy , and consequently an optimal fast sparsely - synchronized rhythm is found to emerge at a minimal wiring cost in an economic sfn .",
    "as the second case of network architecture , we consider an asymmetric preferential attachment of new nodes with different in- and out - degrees ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "for this asymmetric case , we also measure @xmath14 and @xmath15 by varying the `` asymmetry '' parameter @xmath18 denoting the deviation from the above symmetric case , and examine how sparse synchronization varies . as the magnitude @xmath19 of asymmetry parameter",
    "is increased , both @xmath14 and @xmath15 increase , which leads to decrease in efficiency of communication between nodes . as a result ,",
    "the degree of sparse synchronization decreases . for both cases of the positive and the negative asymmetries with the same magnitude ( e.g. , @xmath18=15 and -15 ) ,",
    "their values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 are nearly the same because both the inward and the outward edges are equally involved in computation of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "however , their synchronization degrees become different because of their distinctly different in - degree distributions affecting individual mfrs . in addition to the above process where preferential attachment is made to newly added nodes with probability @xmath20 , as the third case of network architecture we also consider another process where preferential attachment between pre - existing nodes ( without addition of new nodes ) is made with probability @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) . by varying @xmath21 , we also measure @xmath14 and @xmath15 and investigate the effect of this @xmath21-process on sparse synchronization .",
    "as @xmath21 is increased , communication between pre - existing neurons becomes more efficient due to decrease in both @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and hence the degree of sparse synchronization increases .",
    "for these three cases of network architecture , dynamics of individual neurons reveal the inhomogeneous structure of the sfn and hence their contributions to sparse synchronization vary depending on their degrees , in contrast to the case of statistically homogeneous random graphs and small - world networks .",

    "in order to extend previous works on sparse synchronization in statistically homogeneous networks such as random graphs and small - world networks @xcite to the case of inhomogeneous networks , we have investigated emergence of sparsely synchronized brain rhythms in the directed version of the barabsi - albert sfn model with symmetric preferential attachment with the same in- and out - degrees @xmath369 .",
    "fast sparsely synchronized rhythms with stochastic and intermittent neuronal discharges have been found to emerge for large values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    "for this case of full synchronization , all the individual neurons exhibit the same oscillatory behaviors , independently of inhomogeneous network structure .",
    "however , as @xmath1 passes a lower threshold @xmath371 , partial synchronization with @xmath4 ( ensemble - averaged mfr of individual neurons ) occurs due to intermittent discharge of individual neurons . as @xmath1 is increased from @xmath11 , difference between @xmath2 and @xmath12 increases , and when passing a higher threshold @xmath372 , sparsely synchronized rhythms with @xmath6 appear . unlike the case of full synchronization ,",

    "the degree of population synchronization has also been measured in terms of two types of statistical - mechanical spiking and correlation measures . unlike the case of full synchronization , individual neuronal dynamics vary depending on their in - degrees and reveal the inhomogeneous network structure for the case of partial and sparse synchronization , in contrast to the case of statistically homogeneous random graphs and small - world networks . as a next step ,",
    "we have also investigated the effect of network architecture on sparse synchronization for fixed values of @xmath370 and @xmath374 in the following three cases : ( 1 ) variation in the degree of symmetric attachment ( 2 ) asymmetric preferential attachment of new nodes with different in- and out - degrees ( 3 ) preferential attachment between pre - existing nodes ( without addition of new nodes ) . as the degree @xmath10 of symmetric preferential attachment",
    "is increased , both the average path length @xmath14 and the betweenness centralization @xmath15 have been found to decrease .",
    "hence , typical separation between two nodes in the network becomes shorter and load of communication traffic becomes less concentrated on the head hub .",
    "consequently , with increasing @xmath10 the degree of sparse synchronization has been found to become higher due to increased efficiency of communication between nodes . on the other hand",
    ", the normalized axon wire length @xmath305 of the network also increases . through a trade - off between the population synchronization and the wiring economy ,",
    "an optimal sparsely - synchronized rhythm has been found to emerge at a minimal wiring cost in an economic sfn with an optimal degree @xmath375 .",
    "as the second case of network architecture , we have also considered the case of asymmetric preferential attachment of new nodes with different in- and out - degrees ( i.e. , @xmath39 ) . for this case , we have also measured @xmath14 and @xmath15 by varying the asymmetry parameter @xmath18 denoting the deviation from the above symmetric case , and investigated how the sparse synchronization changes . as the magnitude @xmath19 of the asymmetry parameter increases , both @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "have been found to increase symmetrically , independently of the sign of @xmath18 .",
    "hence , with increasing @xmath19 typical separation between two nodes in the network becomes longer and load of communication traffic becomes more concentrated on the head hub , due to increased mismatching between the inward and outward edges .",
    "consequently , as @xmath19 is increased the degree of sparse synchronization has been found to become lower due to decreased efficiency of communication between nodes .",
    "for both cases of the positive and the negative asymmetries with the same magnitude ( e.g. , @xmath340 and -15 ) , the values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 have been found to be nearly the same , because both inward and outward edges are involved equally in computation of @xmath14 and @xmath15 . however , their degrees of sparse synchronization have been found to become different due to their distinctly different in - degree distributions affecting individual mfrs .",
    "in addition to the above @xmath20-process where preferential attachment is made to newly added nodes with probability @xmath20 , we have also considered another @xmath21-process where preferential attachment between pre - existing nodes ( without addition of new nodes ) is made with probability @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) . by varying the probability @xmath21 , we have also measured @xmath14 and @xmath15 and investigated the effect of this @xmath21-process on sparse synchronization . as @xmath21 is increased , communication between pre - existing neurons becomes more efficient due to decrease in both @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and consequently the degree of sparse synchronization has been found to increase .",
    "for these three cases of network architecture , contributions of individual neuronal dynamics on the sparse synchronization were also characterized in terms of their mfrs , firing degrees , pacing degrees , and spiking measures .",
    "it has thus been found that the dynamics of individual neurons vary depending on their in - degrees and reveal the inhomogeneous structure of the sfn , in contrast to the statistically homogeneous networks such as the random graph and the small - world network .",
    "finally , we expect that our results might provide important insights on emergence of fast sparsely synchronized rhythms , associated with diverse cognitive functions such as sensory perception , feature integration , selective attention , and memory formation , in real brain networks with scale - free property .",
