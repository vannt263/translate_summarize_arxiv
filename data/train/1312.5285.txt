    "the discovery of the current acceleration of the cosmological expansion has raised the issue of whether this is due to a new form of matter  dark energy  or whether the general relativistic description of gravity needs to be modified . according to general relativity ( gr )",
    ", any form of energy affects space - time dynamics and so cosmological evolution .",
    "this fact allows for a very simple phenomenological explanation of the observed accelerated expansion , attributing it to a cosmological constant @xmath2 , homogeneously distributed in space and constant in time .",
    "this @xmath2cdm model @xcite is now accepted as the standard cosmological model . at the current epoch",
    "@xmath2 dominates the energy budget , with nonrelativistic cold dark matter ( cdm ) being the next largest contributor , followed by ordinary baryonic matter in third place .",
    "a widely discussed generalization of @xmath2cdm is the @xmath3cdm model in which @xmath2 is replaced by a time - varying dark energy density modeled by a self - interacting scalar field @xmath3 . for recent reviews",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . an alternative explanation of the accelerated cosmological expansion",
    "is that gr is not the correct description of gravity on cosmological scales and must be modified so that on these large scales gravity has the property of making space expand with acceleration . for recent reviews of modified gravity",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we assume that gr provides an adequate model for cosmological gravity and we test various models of dark energy ( de ) as a possible explanation of the observed accelerated cosmological expansion .",
    "in particular , we consider three models of de .",
    "the first one is the standard @xmath2cdm cosmology in which the energy density of de does not evolve in time and its equation of state ( eos ) is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the pressure and @xmath6 the energy density of de .",
    "space sections are not assumed to be flat in this case and the cosmological parameters that characterize the model are @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the current value of the nonrelativistic cdm and baryonic matter density parameter and @xmath9 is that of @xmath2 .",
    "the second model we consider is the simplest modification of @xmath2cdm cosmology in which the energy density of de is time dependent and its eos is parametrized as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is constant and @xmath12 .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath13 is a consequence of the requirement that de provide positive acceleration .",
    "this spatially - flat xcdm model is the simplest parametrization of dynamical de , with parameters @xmath14 .",
    "however , it is incomplete as it can not describe density inhomogenities .",
    "the last model we study is the consistent quintessence model of de in which de is a scalar field .",
    "in particular we consider the much studied spatially - flat @xmath3cdm model whose equations of motion in units where @xmath15 are @xmath16 here an over - dot denotes a derivative with respect to time , @xmath17 is the scale factor , @xmath18 is the energy density of nonrelativistic ( cold dark and baryonic ) matter , @xmath19 is that of the dark energy scalar field @xmath3 , @xmath20 is the planck mass where @xmath21 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath22 is a free parameter of the potential energy density of @xmath3 and determines @xmath23 which is @xmath24^{\\alpha /2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath25 the @xmath3cdm model reproduces the spatially - flat @xmath2cdm cosmology while in the limit @xmath26 it reduces to the einstein  de sitter model with no de but only cdm and baryonic matter .",
    "the value of @xmath27 determines the rapidity of the time - evolution of the de density , with a larger @xmath27 corresponding to more rapidly decreasing de density .",
    "the cosmological parameters of the @xmath3cdm model are @xmath28 .",
    "many different data sets have been used to derive constraints on the parameters of the three models we consider here . in this paper",
    "we use growth - factor measurements to constrain cosmological parameters , under the assumption that gr is the correct model of gravity .",
    "growth factor data have previously been used to test gr . here",

    "we suspect that the reason for this and the reason that the constraining power of growth rate data has not previously been recognized is because these data have almost always been used to constrain cosmological parameters in the context of modified gravity models .",
    "these modified gravity models have more free parameters than the models we have considered here , because we have assumed that general relativity provides an adequate description of gravitation on cosmological scales .",
    "the other striking feature of the growth rate data constraints is that for all three models they align well with those of the snia+@xmath37 joint constraints .",
    "we have used three general - relativistic de cosmological models to analyze the largest collection of growth factor measurements to date . we have discovered that growth factor data constraints on cosmological parameters are quite restrictive , roughly close to those from joint snia+@xmath37 and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) peak length - scale measurements , and less restrictive than those from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy observations .",
    "these growth factor results must be viewed as tentative , given that this is an area of research that is still under active development .",
    "it is important to continue to study possible sources of systematic uncertainty  and given the differences we have found between growth rate data constraints and these from snia and @xmath37 measurements , it is not unreasonable to suspect that there might be an as yet hidden source of systematic uncertainty .",
    "it is , however , clear that growth factor measurements will soon be able to provide cosmological constraints as restrictive and as reliable as those from cmb anisotropy , bao , @xmath37 , and snia measurements .",
