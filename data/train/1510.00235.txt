    "in the 1920s h. hopf discovered the homotopy classification of maps from @xmath1-dimensional closed oriented manifold into the @xmath1-sphere .",
    "namely , he proved that the topological degree of the map determines its homotopy class .",
    "more precisely , there is a bijection from the set of homotopy classes of such maps to the integers .    in 1985 , to obtain new bifurcation results , e.  n.  dancer ( @xcite ) introduced a new degree - type invariant for @xmath2-equivariant gradient maps , which provides more information than the usual equivariant degree .",
    "interestingly , five years later a.  parusiski ( @xcite ) showed that in the absence of group action such an extra homotopy invariant for gradient maps does not exist .",
    "the idea of the more subtle invariant in the equivariant gradient case was developed later by s.  rybicki and his collaborators .",
    "many applications of this construction can be found in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present the hopf type classification of the set of otopy classes of equivariant gradient local maps @xmath3 $ ] in the case of a real finite dimensional orthogonal representation @xmath4 of a compact lie group @xmath5 .",
    "more precisely , first we show a decomposition of @xmath3 $ ] into factors indexed by orbit types appearing in @xmath4 and then we give a description of each factor as the direct sum of a countable number of @xmath6 .",

    "thus we obtain essentially stronger otopy invariant in the gradient case .",
    "recall that otopy is a generalization of the concept of homotopy introduced by becker and gottlieb ( @xcite ) and independently by dancer , gba and rybicki ( @xcite ) .",
    "this study is the natural continuation of our previous work .",
