    "spin - dependent phenomena and particularly transport of spin - polarized carriers in semiconductor heterostructures attract a great attention . one of the key problems of spintronics is a development of efficient methods of injection and detection of spin - polarized carriers",
    ". among various techniques ranging from optical orientation to spin injection from magnetic materials , development of non - magnetic semiconductor injectors and detectors is of the special interest .",
    "spin - orbit interaction underlying such devices couples spin states and space motion of conduction electrons and makes conversion of electric current into spin orientation and vice versa possible .",
    "recently it was demonstatred that transparency of semiconductor barriers may depend on the spin orientation of carriers .",
    "two microscopic mechanisms , rashba spin - orbit coupling induced by the barrier asymmetry  [ 1 - 3 ] and the @xmath0 dresselhaus spin splitting in non - centrosymmetrical materials  [ 4 - 6 ] , were shown to be responsible for the effect of spin - dependent tunneling .",
    "devices based on spin - dependent tunneling were suggested to be utilized as components of the spin field effect transistor  [ 7 ] .    in this report",
    "we present a theory of resonant spin - dependent tunneling through the rtd structure grown of non - centrosymmetrical semiconductors .",
    "we show that the rtd can be employed for injection and detection of spin - polarized carriers .",
    "the effects originate from the spin - orbit coupling - induced splitting of the resonant level .",
    "we consider the transmission of electrons with the initial wavevector @xmath1 through a symmetrical double barrier structure grown along @xmath2 $ ] direction ( see fig.1 ) . here",
    "@xmath3 is the wavevector in the plane of the interfaces , and @xmath4 is wavevector component normal to the barrier and pointing in the direction of tunnelling .",
    "the effective electron hamiltonian of non - centrosymmetrical semiconductors contains spin - dependent @xmath0 dresselhaus term that , for the case of the rtd structure , can be simplified to @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a constant depending on the compound , @xmath7 are the pauli matrices , and the coordinate axes @xmath8 are assumed to be parallel to the cubic crystallographic axes @xmath9 $ ] , @xmath10 $ ] , @xmath11 $ ] , respectively",
    ".    the electron spins @xmath12 corresponding to the spin eigen - states `` @xmath13 '' of the dresselahaus term  ( 1 ) depend on the electron wavevector and are given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the polar angle of the wavevector @xmath16 in the @xmath17 plane , @xmath18 .",
    "solution of the schrdinger equation with the term @xmath19 included allows one to derive the transmission , @xmath20 , and reflection , @xmath21 , coefficients for the electrons of the spin states `` @xmath13 '' .",
    "fig.2 presents the dependencies of the rtd transparency , @xmath22 , on the incident electron energy along growth direction , @xmath23 , at certain in - plane wavevector @xmath24 .",
    "the spin splitting of the resonant peak is clearly seen .    in the case of thick barriers",
    "the structure transparency demonstrates a sharp peaks and hence can be approximated by @xmath25-functions @xmath26,\\ ] ] where transmission efficiency , @xmath27 , and the resonance energy , @xmath28 , can be expanded as @xmath29 here @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the position and the width of the level when the spin - orbit interaction is neglected , the constants @xmath32 and @xmath33 are given by @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the well width and the barrier thickness , @xmath37 is the electron wavevector under the barrier , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the well depth and the barrier height , respectively , and @xmath40 is the effective mass .",
    "spin splitting of the resonant peak at non - zero @xmath41 can be employed for injection of spin - polarized carriers .",
    "we consider two parts of bulk semiconductor separated by a rtd structure . in equilibrium",
    "the momentum distribution of incident electrons is isotropic and therefore the average spin of transmitted carriers vanishes .",
    "this isotropy can be broken by application , for example , of an in - plane electric field , @xmath42 .",
    "the carriers tunnel now with non - zero average wavevector in the plane of interfaces that leads to the spin polarization of transmitted electrons .",
    "the degree of spin polarization of electrons transmitted through the rtd has the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the drift velocity of the incident particles , @xmath45 is the electron charge , @xmath46 is the momentum scattering time , and @xmath47 is an energy equal to @xmath48 for 3d fermi and @xmath49 for 3d boltzmann gas , respectively .",

    "the change of the sign of @xmath50 with the temperature increasing is related to interplay between the spin splitting , @xmath51 , and modification of the widths of the resonant spin sublevels , @xmath52 .",
    "generation of an electric current by spin - polarized carriers represents the effect inverse to spin injection .",
    "now we assume the electron gas on the left side of the double - barrier structure to be spin - polarized .",
    "electrons with various wavevectors tunnel through the barrier . however due to the splitting of the resonant level ,",
    "the rtd transparency for the spin - polarized carriers with the certain in - plane wavevector @xmath3 is larger than the transparency for the particles with the opposite in - plane wavevector , @xmath53 .",
    "this asymmetry results in the in - plane flow of the transmitted electrons near the barrier , i.e. in the interface electric current .",
    "the interface current generated by transmission of spin - polarized electrons through the rtd structure is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the average value of the reciprocal kinetic energy of the carriers , equal to @xmath56 for degenerate and @xmath57 for non - degenerate 3d electron gas , and @xmath58 is the carrier distribution function .",
    "fig.4 presents the dependence of the interface current , @xmath59 , on the energy position of the resonant level , @xmath30 , for degenerate and non - degenerate electron gas .",
    "the direction of the current is determined by the spin orientation of the incident electrons with respect to the crystal axes .",
