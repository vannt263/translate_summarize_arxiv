    "quantum phase transitions happen when a small variation in an external field can fundamentally change ground state properties of a quantum system @xcite .",
    "they provide some of the most striking examples of the richness of many - body quantum physics .",
    "they can be studied in electronic @xcite , cold atom @xcite , and cold ion @xcite systems ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for an overview of the field ) .",
    "traditional condensed matter approaches to quantum phase transitions rely on the identification of the order parameter and studies of correlation functions @xcite .",
    "a different strategy has been recently proposed by the quantum information community and is known as the fidelity approach to quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "fidelity is a popular concept in quantum information science .",
    "it is defined here as the overlap between two ground states f(g,)=|(g)|(g+)| , where @xmath0 is a ground - state wave - function of some hamiltonian @xmath1 , @xmath2 is the external field whose variation induces a quantum phase transition , while @xmath3 is a small shift of this field . since the ground states fundamentally change across the critical point , fidelity should have a minimum near the critical point @xcite . this simple yet powerful observation is the basis of the fidelity approach to quantum phase transitions .",
    "recent studies suggest that fidelity is an efficient probe of quantum criticality @xcite .",
    "in particular , the minimum of fidelity near a critical point has been established in several models .",
    "the scaling of fidelity with distance from the critical point @xmath4 , the field shift @xmath3 , and the system size @xmath5 has been shown to encode the critical exponent @xmath6 characterizing the power - law divergence of the correlation length near the critical point @xcite .",
    "fidelity has been also shown to play a crucial role in quantum phase transitions in quantum fields , where superpositions of ground states from different phases are created @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for a different approach to quantum phase transitions in quantum fields ) .",
    "moreover , fidelity has turned out to be useful in studies of the dynamics of quantum systems ranging from simple two - level @xcite to many - body ones ( see e.g. refs . @xcite and sec .",
    "its relevance to the dynamics of decoherence of a central spin coupled to an environment undergoing a quantum phase transition has been described in ref .",
    "there are two distinct regimes where fidelity can be studied .",
    "the first one corresponds to the limit where the field shift @xmath3 is kept constant and the system size @xmath7 . in this limit one observes anderson orthogonality catastrophe : disappearance of the overlap of two ground states in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "quite interestingly , while the anderson s seminal paper shows power - law decay of the overlap with the system size in a particular model that does not undergo a quantum phase transition , there is an exponential with the system size decay of the overlap , i.e. , fidelity , near the generic quantum critical point @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the second regime corresponds to the limit of the field shift @xmath8 taken at the constant system size @xmath5 . in this limit fidelity",
    "is close to unity and it can be approximated by the lowest - order nontrivial taylor expansion f(g , ) 1 - ( g ) , where the linear in @xmath3 term vanishes due to normalization of the ground states .",
    "the prefactor in the quadratic term , @xmath9 , is called fidelity susceptibility @xcite .",
    "it has been recently intensively studied as a probe of quantum criticality @xcite .",
    "we will study fidelity susceptibility in the quantum ising model in the transverse field .",
    "this is a paradigmatic model of quantum phase transitions : all the basic concepts about both equilibrium @xcite and non - equilibrium @xcite quantum phase transitions have been tested on this model .",
    "its versatile experimental realization shall be possible in the nearest future in cold ion setups @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian that we study is given by h(g ) = -_i=1^n ( ^x_i^x_i+1 + g^z_i ) , [ hising ] where @xmath2 is the magnetic field and @xmath5 is the number of spins .",
    "phase diagram of this model reflects competition between the spin interactions and the magnetic field ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the spin interactions try to align spins in the @xmath10 direction , while the magnetic field polarizes spins along the @xmath11 direction . for large enough magnetic fields",
    "the system is in the paramagnetic phase , while for small magnetic fields it is in the ferromagnetic phase .",

    "[ mainfid ] fidelity susceptibility then reads ( g)=_k^2 = _ k , [ chi ] where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "since fidelity susceptibility is symmetric around @xmath13 , it is sufficient to consider magnetic fields @xmath14 .",

    "( [ chi ] )  note that this sum appears not only in the studies of fidelity susceptibility , but also in the similar studies of quantum geometric tensors @xcite , quantum fischer information @xcite , and quantum adiabatic evolution @xcite .",
    "the first option is to perform the summation numerically , see e.g. ref .",
    "this approach has obvious limitations .",
    "the second option is to expand the summand in the taylor series , see e.g. refs .",
    "this technique is necessarily approximate , it produces results whose range of applicability is a priori unknown , and it can not be deployed at arbitrary magnetic fields .",
    "the third option is to factor out small systems , replace @xmath19 by @xmath20 , and calculate the integral , see e.g. refs .",
    "the main drawback of this approach is that it produces results whose range of applicability can only be guessed .",
    "this range of applicability would be precisely known , had the `` remainders '' in the euler - maclaurin summation formula been studied @xcite , which is complicated and has _ not _ been yet done .",
    "in particular , the replacement of the sum by the integral produces meaningless results near the critical point ( see the discussion below ) .",

    "there are two advantages of the reparametrization of @xmath34 in terms of @xmath35 .",
    "first , while @xmath36 is bounded from above in the ferromagnetic phase , @xmath37 can be arbitrarily large in both phases making it a good parameter to consider the far away limit .",
    "second , it is also a convenient variable for the actual calculations ( see the appendix ) .",
    "we start by rewriting fidelity susceptibility on the paramagnetic side , @xmath38 , as @xmath39 such splitting of fidelity susceptibility into the leading term and remainder @xmath40 is exact . while the leading term was known before @xcite , remainder ( [ chi_remainder ] ) was unknown .",
    "knowledge of the remainder is crucial for determining where @xmath9 can be approximated by the leading term . bound ( [ bound ] ) , proven in the appendix for @xmath41 , shows that for @xmath42 the remainder is negligible ( see also fig .",

    "our result shows why the singularity is absent : the singularity of the leading term in eq .",

    "( [ gie ] ) .",

    "( [ chi_para ] ) and ( [ chi_ferro ] )  the two expressions are in fact two sides of the same coin due to symmetry ( [ symmetry ] ) .    * near the critical point*. we define that the system is near the critical point when |y|<1 .",
    "[ ynear ]    we start by noting that fidelity susceptibility does not have maximum at the critical point @xmath12 .",

    ", we see that @xmath47 has an extremum at @xmath12 ( as it is not the constant function here ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath9 can not have maximum at @xmath48 due to the @xmath49 factor shifting the maximum to @xmath50 .    to simplify the exact result for fidelity susceptibility near the critical point , we taylor - expand @xmath51 in @xmath35 and keep the @xmath49 factor unchanged",
    "such an approximation is welcome for two reasons .",
    "first , it is efficient because @xmath51 is an even function of @xmath35 due to the @xmath52 symmetry of @xmath47 : odd expansion terms vanish .",
