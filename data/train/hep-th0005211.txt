    "over the past two years there has been a great deal of progress in the study of non - bps solitonic states in string theory @xcite . among these",
    "are the stable non - bps d - branes of certain orbifold theories @xcite , and of the type i ( and type ia ) theories @xcite .",
    "all of these stable non - bps states can be elegantly characterized in terms of k theory @xcite .",
    "most of the above non - bps d - branes can be obtained by suitable projections from the corresponding unstable non - bps states of the type ii theories @xcite .",

    "( the same is also the case for the type i d@xmath8-brane . )",
    "the presence of the type i d - instanton is associated with the fact that the actual gauge group of type i is @xmath9 rather than the gauge group of the perturbative type i theory which is @xmath10 .    in this paper we will determine some explicit effects of the type i d - instanton by studying a simple scattering process in m - theory that can be identified , via familiar dualities , with a type i string theory process",

    "the tree - level contribution to the scattering of two @xmath15 gauge particles that are confined to distinct boundaries of the eleven - dimensional space - time will be evaluated in section 3 , as illustrated in figure 1 . since the external particles are localized on distinct boundaries the exchanged bulk states are singlets under both the @xmath15 gauge groups .",
    "we will verify that in the low - momentum limit this amplitude reproduces the same expression as that obtained in the @xmath16 heterotic string ( which will be referred to as the @xmath17 theory ) in the same limit , where the subscripts @xmath18 and @xmath13 refer to the two boundaries ( left and right ) at @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this is true independent of the separation of the boundaries .    in section 4",

    "the four - point function for these states follows very simply from the ten - dimensional expression .",
    "we will also describe the interpretation of this amplitude in terms of the type ia theory in which the background is that of the type iia theory on the @xmath6 orbifold of a circle . in this description",

    "this is analogous to the description of the type iib d - instanton as the dual of the world - line of a type iia d - particle @xcite which also has an origin in eleven - dimensional supergravity @xcite . as in that case",
    ", the supergravity feynman diagram calculation automatically takes into account the appropriate quantum measure , including fermionic zero modes .",
    "these modes are interpreted in terms of massless string states in the type ia picture . as expected",
    ", the d - instanton contribution respects @xmath37 but is not invariant under @xmath38 or @xmath39 , as will be described in some detail in section 4.2 .",

    "the m - theory tree - level calculation can be trusted whenever both @xmath55 and @xmath191 are large .",

    "this can also be seen from the fact that both the radius and the ten - dimensional coupling constant of the dual type ia theory are large .",
    "if we had been working in a regime in which perturbative string theory could be trusted there would have been a paradox .",

    "it is easy to see that such a configuration is not at all similar to the exchange of a d - particle that is contained in the m - theory amplitude .",

    "the fact that the d - instanton action extracted from the spinor scattering process corresponds to that expected for large @xmath183 in the type i theory suggests that the non - bps type i d - instanton remains stable in the non - perturbative region @xmath197 .",
    "the reason why the m - theory calculation reproduces the correct value for the instanton action is related to the fact that for the process we are considering , only one term in the superposition of the d - instanton and the anti - d - instanton contributes .",
    "the corresponding d - instanton action is therefore protected by supersymmetry since the bulk d0-brane that is exchanged is a bps state of type iia ( and the anti - d0-brane does not play a role ) .",
    "we thus expect that the exponent in the amplitude can be trusted beyond the original regime of validity .",
    "although the limit which gives ten - dimensional weakly coupled type i theory reproduces the correct normalisation of the instanton action it will not give the correct value for the coefficient of the exponential .      from its description in terms of k - theory , it is clear that the d - instanton is associated with the fact that the gauge group of type i string theory is @xmath9 rather than the @xmath10 that might have been expected on the basis of perturbation theory @xcite .. the issue of the correct spin cover will be discussed later . ] here we will demonstrate this by considering the dual type ia theory in the standard @xmath198 vacuum . consideration of the perturbative approximation to the low energy effective field theory would suggest that the symmetry group could be @xmath199 . however , we will see that the instantonic contribution to the scattering of spinor states is not invariant under the disconnected component of either of the two @xmath200 groups .",

    "are located at each of the two orientifold planes .",
    "as we have seen , the instantonic contribution to the scattering amplitude comes from the diagram where a @xmath34 ( or @xmath201 ) is emitted from the left orientifold plane and absorbed at the right orientifold plane . in this process",

    "this is an important effect as we shall show momentarily .    in order to obtain a clear picture , it is useful to consider the configuration where the eight @xmath111-branes have been moved to @xmath202 , away from the orientifold fixed plane at @xmath19 ( with corresponding displacements of the mirror eight - branes to @xmath203 ) . in this configuration ,",
    "the ` cosmological constant ' @xmath64 takes the value @xmath204 for @xmath205 and @xmath206 for @xmath207 . as was shown by @xcite , in a background characterised by @xmath64 , each @xmath34 has to carry @xmath208 strings , where the sign of @xmath64 determines whether the string begins or ends on the @xmath34 . the @xmath34 ( and its mirror ) that are emitted from the orientifold plane each carry eight strings in the regime @xmath209 .",
    "these strings can be thought of as stretching between the bulk @xmath34 ( that has been emitted from the orientifold plane ) and the remaining fractional @xmath34 that is still stuck . as the bulk @xmath34 ( and its mirror ) crosses the eight @xmath111-branes ( and their mirrors ) , additional strings are created that join it to the @xmath111-branes .",
    "these can recombine with the original strings to give eight strings that stretch between the stuck @xmath34 and the eight @xmath111-branes , as well as eight strings that stretch between the stuck @xmath34 and the eight mirror @xmath111-branes . in the final configuration the bulk @xmath34 does not have any strings attached to it ,",
    "which is consistent with the fact that @xmath206 in the interval between the two fixed planes .",
    "the sixteen different strings that stretch between the stuck @xmath34 and the eight plus eight @xmath111-branes can be identified with the generators @xmath210 , @xmath211 of the clifford algebra \\ { _ i,_j } = 2 _ ij that give rise to the lie algebra elements of @xmath212 by _",
    "ij = 14 [ _ i,_j ] .",
    "indeed , the elements of the gauge group correspond to 8 - 8 strings , and are therefore bilinear in the 0 - 8 strings that are described by the @xmath210 .",
    "the product of all sixteen 0 - 8 strings ( that arises naturally in the above configuration ) is then the _ chirality operator _ of @xmath200 , = _",
    "i=1 ^ 16 _ i .",
    "thus it follows that the vertex that describes the emission of a single @xmath34 ( or @xmath195 ) is actually given by ( s_1 s_2 ) , where @xmath213 describes the state in the spinor representation for the two fractional @xmath34 s .",
    "more generally , if @xmath64 bulk @xmath34 s are emitted , the vertex will be ( s_1 s_2 ^m ) , since each bulk @xmath34 gives rise to one chirality operator .",
    "the chirality operator @xmath214 is invariant under conjugation by any element of @xmath2 , but it changes sign under conjugation by an element @xmath215 in the disconnected component of @xmath200 , @xmath216 .",
    "this implies that the vertex with odd @xmath64 only respects the @xmath2 subgroup of @xmath200 .",
    "since the contributions with odd @xmath64 are precisely those that appear in the instantonic contribution to the amplitude , this exponentially suppressed contribution is associated with the breaking of @xmath200 to @xmath2 . in terms of type i",
    ", @xmath4 is a subgroup of @xmath9 .",
    "the large @xmath10 transformations that are not in @xmath9 can be taken to lie in @xmath3 ; these transformations are indeed not respected by the d - instanton , as was stressed in @xcite .",
    "the actual gauge group of the ten - dimensional type i theory is @xmath217 .",
    "upon compactification to nine dimensions with the above wilson line , this is broken to @xmath218 , where the @xmath126 outside the bracket indicates that either both the elements of @xmath219 are in the disconnected component of @xmath220 or neither of them are . as we have just explained , the effect of the d - instanton of type i is to impose this constraint .",
    "the actual gauge group is somewhat smaller since the nine - dimensional type ia theory also has a d - instanton that is t - dual to the wrapped d0-brane of type i. this instanton is stuck on one of the two fixed planes , and it is responsible for breaking each @xmath220 separately to @xmath221 .",
    "( this follows by essentially the same arguments that were used by witten for the case of the ten - dimensional type i d - instanton . )",
    "thus the actual gauge group is ( spin(16 ) spin(16 ) ) / _ 2 , where the element in the centre by which the group is divided is the element that does not allow states transforming in the vector representation of one @xmath221 and the scalar representation of the other .",
    "it is not difficult to see that all allowed ( and no other ) conjugacy classes of representations of this gauge group are actually present in both nine dimensional heterotic theories .",
    "( this discussion is relevant for some issues raised in @xcite . )",
    "in this paper we have identified the d - instanton contribution to a certain amplitude involving spinor states of type i , using the relation of nine - dimensional type i to m - theory .",
    "this relation involves type ia , and it is therefore natural to ask whether the @xmath6 non - bps d - instanton of type ia ( that is t - dual to the d0-brane of type i with its world - line wrapped along @xmath22 ) can also be understood in terms of m - theory ( compare also @xcite ) .",
    "the wrapped d0-brane of type i can be obtained from a d1-brane anti - d1-brane pair that are wrapped around @xmath22 and @xmath222 say , and that have a relative wilson line along @xmath222 . under t - duality of the @xmath22-circle",
    ", we therefore obtain a d0-brane and an anti - d0-brane , both localised on the _ same _ orientifold plane and wrapped around @xmath222 with a relative wilson line .",
    "one should therefore expect that the type ia d - instanton contributes to the scattering diagram @xmath33 where now all four d - particles are localised on the same boundary .",
    "an analysis of this process can be made that is analogous to that of the main part of the paper , with the important difference that the propagator ( [ schw1 ] ) does not involve a @xmath223 , and therefore becomes ( p^m ; 0 , 0 ) = 1 r_11l_p _ m=-^ = 1 _ n e^-2 |n| r_11l_p .",
    "the term with @xmath224 should correspond to a part of the contribution of the type ia @xmath6 d - instanton .",
    "the terms with @xmath225 come from multiple windings of the @xmath34 world - line and , as in the earlier case , carry the same @xmath6 topological charge as the @xmath224 term ; the latter is therefore the dominant contribution .",
    "thus the tree amplitude describing the exchange of the graviton and the three - form in type ia variables is approximated by a_4 = 12 ( 2l_s^i)^2 1(4)^13/3 t_8 f^4 , [ oneaa ] where we have only exhibited explicitly the term whose group structure is the same as in the main part of the paper . by essentially the same arguments as above , the coupling of the spinors to the bulk graviton and three - form should again involve a chirality operator and therefore break @xmath200 to @xmath2 .",
    "however , the type ia instanton should contribute a term of the form @xmath226 to the amplitude ( for some constant , @xmath227 ) . since the m - theory calculation is justified only in the region of large large @xmath228 , where @xmath229 , the expression ( [ oneaa ] ) can only represent the first term in an expansion of the exponent in powers of @xmath180 .",
