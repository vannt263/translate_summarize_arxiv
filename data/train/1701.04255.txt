    "<S> compact and electrically controllable on - chip sources of indistinguishable photons are desirable for the development of integrated quantum technologies . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that two quantum dot light emitting diodes ( leds ) in close proximity on a single chip can function as a tunable , all - electric quantum light source . </S>",
    "<S> light emitted by an electrically excited driving led is used to excite quantum dots the neighbouring diode . </S>",
    "<S> the wavelength of the quantum dot emission from the neighbouring driven diode is tuned via the quantum confined stark effect . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that we can electrically tune the fine structure splitting .        </S>",
    "<S> sources of indistinguishable single photons or entangled photon pairs have applications in quantum key distribution @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , imaging @xcite and linear optical quantum computing @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> self assembled quantum dots ( qds ) can be used in solid - state quantum light sources . in an inas qd the decay of a bright neutral or singly charged exciton results in the emission of a single photon @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the biexciton cascade of a qd has been used to generate on - demand entangled photon pairs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these qds are produced using well - developed semiconductor fabrication techniques , allowing them to be integrated into semiconductor devices and photonic cavities .    </S>",
    "<S> an ongoing challenge of working with self assembled quantum dots is their random distribution in the size , shape and chemical composition , which leads to a random distribution in the wavelength of the emitted photons . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution in transition energies is over @xmath0 times the width of each individual line , consequently the probability of two randomly chosen quantum dots having emission lines at the same wavelength is less than @xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> any difference in wavelength between photons makes them distinguishable . clearly this obstacle </S>",
    "<S> must be overcome in order to realise the many applications of quantum light sources that make use of hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) interference , which requires the photons to be indistinguishable .    </S>",
    "<S> several methods of tuning the emission wavelengths of quantum dots in - situ have been explored , including varying the temperature @xcite , magnetic field @xcite , strain @xcite and electric field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter approach is very promising as it allows for individual tuning of many closely spaced devices suitable for producing compact integrated quantum technologies . </S>",
    "<S> we note that although strain tuning is usually applied to a whole device , recently a device was developed that would in principle be suitable for the production of multiple strain tuned diodes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> strain tuning can also be used in tandem with electric tuning in order to allow independent control over the exciton and biexciton energies @xcite .             </S>",
    "<S> v.,width=8 ]            applying a vertical electric field to a qd causes the transitions to undergo a stark shift , which tunes the wavelength of the emitted photons . in most devices , applying an electric field of over @xmath2 kv @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> can result in the quenching of emission @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this can be increased by an order of magnitude by embedding the quantum dots in a gaas / algaas quantum well , resulting in an increased tuning range @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these structures have been used to demonstrate electric control of a spin @xcite , tuning of the g - factor of trapped spins @xcite and tuning of the fine structure splitting ( fss ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a small fss is required to produce entangled photons from the bi - exciton cascade . </S>",
    "<S> the key advantages of electrically tunable devices are that many individually tunable devices can be produced on a single chip using standard photo - lithographic semiconductor processing techniques and , unlike piezo - tuned systems , they do not suffer from long term drift @xcite .    for the development of compact and scalable quantum technologies , the capability to electrically trigger </S>",
    "<S> the generation of photons is desirable and has lead to the development of a single photon @xcite and entangled photon @xcite light emitting diodes . </S>",
    "<S> combining the advantages of wavelength tuning and electrical excitation of quantum dots would allow the electrically triggered generation of indistinguishable photons from different sources .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate a method of producing electrically triggered anti - bunched light from an electrically tunable source . </S>",
    "<S> the device is fabricated from a section of a single wafer and contains 16 individually tunable diode structures on a single chip .    </S>",
    "<S> the devices used in this study are @xmath4m@xmath5 m planar microcavity leds containing a layer of inas quantum dots embedded in a 10 nm gaas quantum well with al@xmath6ga@xmath7as barriers . distributed bragg reflectors ( dbrs ) grown above ( 4 repeats ) and below the inas ( 15 repeats ) quantum dot layer and quantum well </S>",
    "<S> are used to form a half - wavelength cavity . </S>",
    "<S> this unbalanced cavity both increases the portion of qd light emitted vertically and acts as a horizontal waveguide for optical emission from the inas wetting layer . </S>",
    "<S> the top dbr is doped p - type and the bottom dbr is doped n - type to form a diode structure suitable for electrical excitation . </S>",
    "<S> the key idea is to use light produced by one led to excite the qds in the neighbouring diode . </S>",
    "<S> we run one led ( diode 1 ) in forward bias , resulting in broadband emission from the inas wetting layer . </S>",
    "<S> the emitted light is guided horizontally due to the bragg reflectors above and below the wetting layer . </S>",
    "<S> a portion of the emitted light is incident on the neighbouring led ( diode 2 ) and will be absorbed by the wetting layer , generating excitons . </S>",
    "<S> these will be subsequently captured by quantum dots in diode 2 resulting in quantum light emission ( see figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this on - chip in plane excitation scheme is similar to the scheme presented in @xcite , which makes use of a whispering - gallery - mode qd laser to excite a qd embedded in a nearby micropillar .    </S>",
    "<S> the cavity mode of the planar microcavity matches the emission wavelength of the quantum dots of interest , increasing the proportion of qd emission directed upwards into the collection optics . </S>",
    "<S> varying the bias across diode 2 allows wavelength tuning by stark shifting the transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum dots are embedded in a quantum well ( as in @xcite ) in order to increase the maximum voltage that can be applied without quenching the emission .    </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of light emission from diode 2 can be controlled by varying the voltage across diode 1 and the devices show good diode - like behaviour ( figure [ fig3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we apply a voltage of 2.5v ( corresponding to a current density of @xmath8 a @xmath9 ) to diode 1 , resulting in a broad emission spectrum with a peak at around 870 nm corresponding to the inas wetting layer ( figure [ fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig5 ] shows the observed emission spectrum of a qd in diode 2 as a function of the applied electric field - a stark shift of over 5 nm is visible .    </S>",
    "<S> a diffraction grating was used to spectrally filter the output of diode 2 to pick out light from a single emission line . </S>",
    "<S> the filtered light was then directed into a hanbury brown and twiss setup in order to perform a second - order correlation function ( @xmath10 ) measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the result can be seen in figure [ fig6 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a dip in @xmath10 as @xmath11 approaches 0 , giving @xmath12 , below the @xmath13 threshold , which shows the output is dominated by light from a single quantum emitter . </S>",
    "<S> this is an order of magnitude improvement on the values of @xmath14 measured in prior demonstrations of on - chip in - plane excitation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that @xmath15 , even though we have accounted for the detector response . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this to the leakage of light from diode 1 into the output .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we demonstrate that we can tune the fss as a function of electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the inset in figure [ fig6 ] shows fine structure splitting of an exciton in diode 2 as a function of the electric field across diode 2 , indicating that these devices could be used as sources of entangled photon pairs .    in the future we can envisage a number of changes that would increase the efficiency of the device . for example , diode 1 </S>",
    "<S> could be structured to increase the directionality of emission towards diode 2 by means of a unidirectional antenna . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , a waveguide between the leds could increase the cross - coupling efficiency , with in principle one driving led exciting many tunable leds . </S>",
    "<S> the use of fast electronics and low rc constant devices could allow ` on - demand ' emission by either varying the bias to diode 1 to modulate the ` pump ' or by varying the bias to diode 2 to modulate the wavelength .    </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated an all - electric tunable quantum source fabricated using a simple photo - lithographic process . </S>",
    "<S> while this is a proof - of - principle device intended to demonstrate the possibility of an electrically tunable and electrically driven quantum light source , we anticipate that future work will improve the coupling between driven and driving leds and lead to the production of devices suitable for compact multiplexed on - chip quantum optics technologies . </S>"
