    "in recent times a growing interest to applications of supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susy qm ) in different fields of theoretical and mathematical physics is noticed .",
    "thus , it has been applied to generate new families of exactly solvable potentials @xcite@xcite , to study ordinary symmetries of the set of riccati equations @xcite , and also to analyse a new kind of symmetry of ordinary differential equations , called translational invariance with respect to darboux transformations @xcite . as it has been understood after the work by andrianov et al .",
    "@xcite , susy qm ( first introduced by witten @xcite as a toy model in quantum field theory ) is basically equivalent to a method of finding solutions of a differential equation from the known solutions of another equation just by applying to them a differential operator .",
    "this approach was studied for the first time by darboux @xcite and is known nowadays as the method of darboux transformations .",
    "its most famous applications are related with nonlinear equations of mathematical physics @xcite and inverse scattering problem @xcite@xcite .",
    "another formulation of the same method is due to schrdinger and it is known as factorization method in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "though this method is widely used for schrdinger - like equations , its application to systems of equations , and in particular to the dirac system , is studied much less .",
    "probably the first paper where a differential - matrix intertwining operator for the dirac equation is constructed is due to anderson @xcite .",
    "it deals with component equations for the transformation operator . for the particular case of a pseudoscalar potential",
    "this author has found rather complicated equations defining the transformation operator .",
    "this might be the reason why his method has not received much popularity . in another paper @xcite stahlhofen",
    "applies a general theorem proved in @xcite to study transparent pseudoscalar potentials for the dirac equation , obtaining and analysing new kind of potentials with eigenvalues embedded in the continuous spectrum . although there is not a new technique in this paper",
    ", it illustrates the idea that similar methods may find unexpected applications .",
    "we notice also the papers @xcite ( for a review see @xcite ) where _ ad hoc _ darboux transformation operators are constructed for some systems of differential equations , and the paper @xcite where the authors use differential transformation operators for finding particular solutions of the inverse problem for a regular dirac operator .",
    "we would like to remark that the technique of integral intertwining operators is well - known in the method of inverse quantum scattering @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , but differential - matrix intertwiners have been found only quiet recently @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we give a consistent introduction to differential - matrix intertwining operators for the one - dimensional stationary dirac equation ( section 2 ) and study their main properties .",
    "we shall show that every property of a differential intertwiner for the schrdinger equation finds its counterpart in the case of the dirac equation .",
    "thus , in section 3 we prove a theorem about factorization of a polynomial of dirac operators by means of darboux transformation operators , which serves as a basis for establishing a hidden quadratic supersymmetry underlying our method ( section 6 ) . in section 4",
    "we show that despite the fact that our transformation operators have nontrivial kernels , a one - to - one correspondence between the spaces of solutions of the initial and transformed equations is possible .",
    "section 5 is devoted to analysing transformation operators as acting in a hilbert space . in section 7",
    "we study chains of transformations and establish relativistic analogs of crum determinant formulas @xcite .",
    "sections 8 and 9 are devoted to studying particular cases of pseudoscalar and scalar potentials .",
    "our method is widely illustrated by numerous examples given in section 10 .",
    "finally , in section 11 we draw some conclusions and give an outlook of future works .",
    "consider the one - dimensional stationary dirac equation @xmath0 here @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 is a pauli matrix , @xmath4 , @xmath5 is @xmath6 real symmetric potential matrix and the function @xmath7 is a two - component vector ( we shall call it spinor ) , @xmath8 ( the superscript  @xmath9 \" meaning the transpose ) .",

    "it is natural to call any differential transformation operator darboux transformation operator @xcite .    using the intertwining relation ( [ splet ] ) , and assuming the linear independence of derivative operators @xmath21 , @xmath22 , we are led to the following system of equations for @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath13 : @xmath23 & & a v_0 - v_1 a + b \\gamma - \\gamma b - \\gamma a_x = 0\\ , , \\label{eqv}\\\\ [ 1ex ] & & a v_{0x } + b v_0 - \\gamma b_x - v_1 b = 0\\ , .",

    "we notice that ( [ equ2 ] ) is very similar to the initial dirac eq .",
    "( [ dirac0 ] ) .",
    "the single difference is that @xmath7 is a spinor and @xmath36 is a number , while @xmath33 and @xmath37 are matrices",
    ". nevertheless , if solutions of ( [ dirac0 ] ) are known we can immediately solve ( [ equ2 ] ) .",
    "since the matrix @xmath34 is hermitian it always can be reduced to a diagonal form .",
    "therefore let us take @xmath34 to be diagonal @xmath38 if we now choose @xmath39 , where spinors @xmath40 and @xmath41 are solutions of ( [ dirac0 ] ) with the eigenvalues @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively , @xmath44 then @xmath33 is a solution of ( [ equ2 ] )",
    ". we will choose the spinors @xmath40 and @xmath41 real , which is always possible if we suppose @xmath45 and @xmath46 to be real .",

    "this means that the set of the spinors @xmath70 , when @xmath7 runs through the whole space of solutions of the initial equation , may in general not coincide with the whole space of the solutions of the transformed equation . in section  3",
    "we shall show that despite this fact a one - to - one correspondence between the spaces of solutions of the equations ( [ dirac0 ] ) and ( [ dirac1 ] ) may be established .",
    "to define the dirac hamiltonian and the transformation operator we have not used the notion of the hilbert space and an inner product is not defined in the space of spinors . nevertheless , we need operators adjoint to given ones . therefore in the space of operators we are working",
    "we shall define the operation of conjugation in a formal way .",
    "namely , we will require @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 ( where @xmath74 is the imaginary unity ) , and if @xmath19 is a matrix , @xmath75 is its hermitian conjugate in the usual sense ( i.e. , it is obtained from @xmath19 by transposing and taking the complex conjugation ) .",
    "moreover , for a given invertible matrix @xmath33 we will assume that the operations of taking the inverse and adjoint commute , i.e. , @xmath76    it is easy to see that the dirac operators @xmath77 and @xmath78 are self - adjoint .",

    "it is well known that for any fixed value of the energy the dirac system ( [ dirac0 ] ) has two linearly independent solutions .",

    "we get the spinors @xmath82 and @xmath83 with eigenvalues @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "they do not belong to the space @xmath86 and hence @xmath87 are nontrivial solutions of the transformed equation with the eigenvalues @xmath88 .",
    "we will find them next .    for this purpose",
    "we need a counterpart of the wronskian which , like in the case of the schrdinger equation , may be defined as a function of two solutions @xmath7 and @xmath89 corresponding to the same eigenvalue @xmath36 , which is independent of the variable @xmath10 . using the adjoint form of the eq .",
    "( [ dirac0 ] ) , we easily find @xmath90 which means that @xmath91 hence , the function @xmath92 we just defined can play the role of the wronskian .",
