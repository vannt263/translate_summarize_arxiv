    "the extraordinary level of interest in the study of single layer graphene has led to the prediction and observation of several unusual phenomena not found in other low - dimensional systems .",
    "these new properties are mainly a consequence of the chiral and massless character of the quasiparticles in graphene @xcite .",
    "this new material is not only expected to lead to several technological applications , but has also helped shed light on relativistic quantum effects , such as klein tunneling @xcite and zitterbewegung .",
    "there is currently a search for experimental methods for producing high quality samples of graphene in large quantities .",
    "however , the current experimental techniques can also create carbon structures with two or more layers .",
    "it has already been recognized that graphene bilayers ( i.e. two coupled layers of graphene ) can display interesting new properties that are distinct from those of single - layers @xcite and that can also be eventually harnessed for the development of devices .",
    "one important aspect of these structures is the fact that , in comparison with the in - plane interactions , the comparatively weaker interlayer coupling can yet exert a significant influence on the carrier spectrum .",
    "thus , whereas the electronic dispersion at the vicinity of the fermi energy in single layer graphene is linear , in bilayer graphene it displays an approximately parabolic shape with the appearance of higher energy bands .",
    "moreover , in striking contrast with single layers , the electronic spectrum of bilayer graphene has been shown to develop a gap in the presence of an external electric field .",
    "thus , the interlayer coupling in stacked layers of graphene gives rise to a rich set of properties that are not found in monolayers , and can be expected to be of particular significance in structures with three or more layers .    in this work",
    "we investigate the properties of three coupled layers of graphene , i.e. trilayer graphene ( tlg ) in the presence of an external magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the layers .",
    "the properties of tlg in the absence of a magnetic field have been considered in the literature within a tight - binding model ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , as well as through first principles calculations @xcite .",
    "the effect of an external magnetic field was calculated by means of an approximation based on the mapping of stacked graphene layers to an 1d tight - binding chain by guinea _",
    "recent experimental studies have investigated the landau level spectrum @xcite and the magnetoconductance of tlg @xcite .",
    "these results showed that one important aspect of tlg is the fact that the energy bands at the vicinity of the fermi energy are very sensitive to the particular type of stacking of the layers .",
    "the two more relevant stacking rules are the rhombohedral , or abc stacking , and the bernal , or aba stacking . in each case , the relative positions of the lowermost layer ( c in one case and a in the other ) helps dictate the possible symmetries of the subsequent wavefunctions associated with each layer .",
    "the type of stacking is also relevant to the properties of the landau levels of the tlg , and it has recently been reported @xcite that 15% of exfoliated tlg has rhombohedral ( abc ) stacking .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to present analytical results for the spectrum of tlg in a magnetic field considering different potentials in each layer . in order to do",
    "that we perform a direct diagonalization of the six - band continuum model and obtain analytical expressions for the landau level spectrum as function of magnetic field and the potentials at each layer , for both the abc and aba stackings . in particular , we calculate the tlg spectrum in the presence of electric fields that break the layer symmetry .",
    "it has recently been shown that these different potentials can lead to the opening of a gap in the tlg spectrum @xcite . in the present paper we focus on the modifications of the landau levels as function of the layer potential .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present the model and solve the resulting system of equations for the aba stacking , followed by section iii in which we present the model and obtain solutions for the abc stacking .",
    "section iv shows and discusses the calculated landau level spectra and finally , the results are summarized in the conclusions .",
    "let us consider a system consisting of three coupled graphene layers , in the context of the tight - binding model .",
    "we assume nearest neighbor hopping between sites within each layer , described by the coupling parameter @xmath0 . in the continuum approximation",
    ", this parameter determines the magnitude of the fermi velocity @xmath1 m@xmath2s .",
    "the nearest neighbor interlayer coupling scheme is @xmath3 , with coupling parameter @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in order to capture some of the finer details of the spectrum",
    ", we also include a remote coupling term @xmath5 between sites of sublattices @xmath6 and @xmath7 and @xmath8 between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the hamiltonian is given as @xmath11 where @xmath12 , with @xmath13 being the components of the in - plane momentum ; @xmath14 is the potential in each layer , respectively , @xmath15 is the onsite energy at sublattices @xmath6 , @xmath16 and @xmath7 , and we defined the eigenstates as @xmath17^t$ ] . in the presence of a uniform magnetic field in the z direction , with the gauge @xmath18 and , for a given sublattice @xmath19 , @xmath20 , one obtains the following system of equations :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 and we defined the operators @xmath26 which obey the commutation relation @xmath27 = 2\\beta$ ] .    for @xmath28",
    "the system can be easily solved by making use of its reflection symmetry .",
    "thus , we can define symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of the spinor components .",
    "for the antisymmetric case we obtain @xmath29 and @xmath30 that leads to the following pair of coupled equations    @xmath31    for the sake of convenience , let us now define the operator @xmath32 we can now decouple the equations to obtain @xmath33\\phi_{g},\\ ] ] which corresponds to the equation that gives the spectrum for a _ single _ graphene layer under an effective electrostatic potential @xmath34 as well as a finite gap term given by @xmath35 .",

    "[ 15 ] we have @xmath37 ev , @xmath38 ev and @xmath39 ev .",
    "hence , the additional effective potential leads to an energy shift of @xmath40 mev , and @xmath41 mev .",
    "thus , the effect of the remote coupling terms @xmath5 and @xmath8 , as well as the on - site energy term @xmath15 is only to introduce a small shift of the dispersion branches and to generate a small gap in the energy spectrum .    for the symmetric case we have @xmath42 and",
    "@xmath43 the equations become    @xmath44    and @xmath45    these equations can be decoupled , resulting in the fourth - order differential equation @xmath46 where @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "this equation is similar to the one describing bilayer graphene .",
    "a second - order equation can be obtained by calculating the roots of the second - order equation as @xmath49 with @xmath50 where we set @xmath51 , since this term only introduces a shift of the wavefunction in particular , for @xmath52 , @xmath53 the equations yield results that are identical to those of a gapless single - layer and bilayer graphene , i.e. the landau levels are found as the solutions of @xmath54 .",
    "as in the previous case , the addition of remote coupling terms introduces a gap in the spectrum .",
    "a more realistic description of tlg structures should take into account asymmetries between the different layers , which can be brought about by the interaction with a substrate or by gating . in order to assess the effect of layer symmetry breaking in the spectrum ,",
    "let us now consider the case @xmath55 .",
    "in addition , we now consider @xmath56 , since we assume that the shifts caused by the layer potentials are more significant than the effect of these terms .",

    "the spectrum should then consist of a superposition of the spectra of single layer graphene and bilayer graphene .",
