    "historically , neutral hydrogen ( h  i ) in the disk of the fourth quadrant of the milky way has been understudied . the last fully sampled survey of this region was made with the parkes 18 m radiotelescope in the 1970 s with an angular resolution of 48  @xcite .",
    "recently the international galactic plane survey @xcite consortium has undertaken a large - scale project to produce a fully sampled survey of the galactic plane with one arcminute resolution . for the fourth quadrant , in particular , the southern galactic plane survey ( sgps ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) constitutes more than an order of magnitude improvement in angular resolution over previous surveys .",
    "in the southern milky way little is known about the full extent of the h  idisk and the shape of the h  i  density fall - off with galactic radius .",
    "@xcite made an ambitious attempt to measure the full extent of the h  i  disk .",
    "the idea behind their work was that for very large radii the radial velocity of the gas approaches the projection of the local standard of rest ( lsr ) velocity , @xmath1 , onto the line of sight .",
    "for an extended disk of h  i  there should be a pile - up of gas at @xmath2 . despite several very deep integrations ,",
    "@xcite did not detect a pile - up .",
    "subsequent attempts , including a recent one with the green bank telescope , have also failed to detect any significant pile - up of gas at extreme velocities @xcite .",
    "the outer disks of large spiral galaxies occasionally show clear h  ispiral arms extending to galactic radii in excess of 30 kpc , while the stellar arms stop at radii of @xmath3 kpc .",
    "a classic example is m83 , where the h  i  spiral arms extend three times as far as the stellar arms @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the positions of the h  i  spiral arms in the outer milky way are not well known .",
    "early studies of galactic spiral structure suggest possible arms out to distances of 20 kpc or more .",
    "in particular , the @xcite latitude - velocity diagrams show a ridge of h  i  in the fourth quadrant at extreme positive velocities .",
    "@xcite maps this feature as a non - continuous spiral arm from @xmath4 to @xmath5 . @xcite also interpreted the low longitude ( @xmath6 ) end of this feature as an outer spiral arm , possibly associated with high - velocity clouds . despite these early studies ,",
    "there has been very little interpretation of this ridge and no discussion of it beyond @xmath5 .",
    "here we present new data from the sgps on this extreme positive velocity ridge from @xmath7 to @xmath8 and discuss its structure .",
    "we argue that it is a cohesive structure and interpret it as a distant h  i  spiral arm at the edge of the milky way . using a simple galactic spiral model ,",
    "we show that the shape is well - fit by a spiral arm with a pitch angle of @xmath0 .",
    "the data presented here are part of the southern galactic plane survey , a survey of the h  i  spectral line and 21 cm continuum emission in the fourth quadrant of the plane of the milky way .",
    "the h  i  data product is a combination of high resolution , interferometric data obtained from the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) and low resolution data from the parkes radiotelescope , covering the region @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "the lower resolution parkes survey covers an extended latitude range of @xmath11 . a complete discussion of the observational and data reduction techniques is given by @xcite and will be described further in mcclure - griffiths et al .",
    "( 2004 , in prep . ) .",
    "the final h  i  cubes , made by combining deconvolved images from parkes and the atca in the fourier domain , have an angular resolution of @xmath12 2 arcminutes , a channel spacing of @xmath13  @xmath14  and rms brightness temperature sensitivity per channel of @xmath15 k.",
    "combining data from all fields in the sgps we created a composite longitude - velocity ( _ l - v _ ) diagram at @xmath16 of the region @xmath17 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lv ] . examining fig .",
    "[ fig : lv ] , we see that at the most extreme positive velocities there is a thin ridge of emission that arcs from @xmath18 , @xmath19 @xmath14through @xmath20 , @xmath21 @xmath14 , to @xmath22 , @xmath23 @xmath14 , and possibly extending as far as @xmath24 .",
    "the feature is kinematically distinct from the surrounding gas , rising to brightness temperatures of @xmath25 k over velocity widths on the order of @xmath26 @xmath14 .",
    "it is notably the last feature in the _ l - v _ diagram ; beyond this the profiles extend with long tails into the noise .",
    "the feature is relatively cohesive over the entire observed longitude range , with the only notable exception between @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where the arc shifts approximately 10 @xmath14  to higher velocities .",
    "overlaid on fig .",
    "[ fig : lv ] are lines of constant galactocentric radius at @xmath29 kpc and 24 kpc , assuming a @xcite rotation curve with the iau recommended values for the lsr , @xmath30 , and galactic center distance , @xmath31 kpc .",
    "the feature extends from about @xmath32 kpc ( heliocentric distance , @xmath33 kpc ) at the low longitude end to about @xmath34 kpc ( @xmath35 kpc ) at the high longitude end . at these radii",
    "the orbital period of the feature must be on the order of 500 myr .",
    "if we assume that the gas in the feature is optically thin , we can estimate a lower limit to the average h  i  number density along the midplane of the feature of @xmath36 . integrating over the @xmath37-width of the feature , we find average h  i  surface density of @xmath38 .",
    "this is almost certainly an underestimate of the total surface density .",
    "using gaussian fits to the velocity profiles along the feature , we have measured the velocity width in 48 directions where the emission is strongest .",
    "these fits cover the longitude range @xmath39 to @xmath40 , with a 10 degree gap around @xmath41 , where the feature is too weak to be reliably fit .",
    "we find that the velocity width of the feature has a mean of @xmath42  @xmath14  with no significant azimuthal or radial variation .",
    "the measured velocity width is slightly larger than values obtained for the velocity dispersion in the outer galaxy , which are on the order of 5 @xmath14  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore assume that the velocity profiles are broadened by the spatial extent of the feature , @xmath43 , times the velocity gradient , @xmath44 .",
    "if we assume that the velocity dispersion is 5 @xmath14 , then the upper limit of the physical line - of sight width of the feature is @xmath45 kpc along most of its length .",
    "the warp of the h  i  disk in the fourth quadrant is such that at @xmath46 kpc the disk is coming back towards the galactic midplane .",
    "however , the feature is not restricted to @xmath16 , but extends as far as @xmath47 below the plane . fig .",
    "[ fig : peaktb ] is a grey - scale image of the peak brightness temperature observed with parkes ( for latitude coverage @xmath48 ) calculated for galactic radii between @xmath49 kpc .",
    "the feature varies in latitude along its length , sweeping gradually from a minimum central latitude of @xmath50 ( @xmath51 pc ) at @xmath52 to a central latitude of @xmath16 near @xmath53 . at all longitudes",
    "there is significant emission at @xmath16 , which allowed us to detect the feature in our high - resolution _ l - v _ diagram of @xmath54 .",
    "the full - width at half - max in @xmath37 of the feature is relatively constant around @xmath55 kpc , varying between extremes of @xmath56 kpc and @xmath57 kpc .",
    "these values are consistent with , though somewhat larger than , the h  i  scale height at @xmath58 found by @xcite .",
    "following @xcite we estimate that a disk density of @xmath59 would be required to confine the scale height of the feature .",
    "though @xcite notes that this density is consistent with the e - folding length of the stellar disk , there is little evidence that the stellar disk extends beyond 1.5 - 2@xmath60 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore must assume that the required density for confinement is provided by dark matter ; an assumption supported by the dark matter model of @xcite .",
    "here we consider several possible physical explanations for the observed ridge . a strong ridge of emission in the _ l - v _ diagram is usually indicative of a density enhancement , a velocity perturbation or a combination of the two .",
    "only for a very extended , smooth h  i  disk can a ridge of emission appear at the most extreme velocity with no extra velocity perturbation . in this case",
    "the final feature of the _ l - v _ diagram is a pile - up in velocity space at the projection of the lsr velocity onto the line of sight , following a curve in _ l - v _ space of the form @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "we can easily exclude this explanation .",
    "first , if this effect were apparent one would expect to see a similar ridge in the _ l - v _",
    "diagram for the first and second galactic quadrants , which we do not .",
    "second , the velocities of the observed feature do not agree with @xmath61 .",
    "assuming the iau accepted value for the lsr velocity of @xmath62 @xmath14 , we would expect the ridge at @xmath63  @xmath14  at @xmath64 and at @xmath65 @xmath14  at @xmath66 , whereas at those longitudes we observe this feature at @xmath67 @xmath14  and @xmath68 @xmath14 , respectively . to be consistent with a disk pile - up in velocity space ,",
    "the lsr velocity would need to be reduced by almost a factor of two , to the unreasonable value of @xmath69 @xmath14 .",
    "the difference of oort s constants @xmath70 , which gives the ratio @xmath71 , is well constrained by _ hipparcos _ measurements of cepheid variables to be @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "reducing @xmath1 to @xmath73 @xmath14  would force the galactic center distance to an unacceptable value of @xmath74 kpc .",
    "it is therefore , highly unlikely that this is the long sought pile - up of distant disk gas .",
    "the most obvious cause of the feature is an outer spiral arm , resulting in a slight ( nominally a factor of two ) density enhancement and a significant ( @xmath3 @xmath14 ) velocity perturbation , both of which contribute to the creation of a ridge in the _ l - v _ diagram .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the feature s shape in _ l - v _ space , which agrees well with a spiral arm found in a synthetic _ l - v _ diagram of the galactic spiral arms and by its relatively small radial width ( @xmath75 kpc ) , which suggests the action of a spiral density wave that provides a radial confining force where there would otherwise be none .",
    "we created a simple synthetic _",
    "l - v _ diagram , following the recipe in @xcite , modified to assume a four - arm spiral in agreement with the galactic spiral models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we allow the pitch angle , @xmath76 , to vary such that @xmath77 varies linearly from @xmath78 at @xmath79 kpc to @xmath80 at @xmath81 kpc .",
    "the differential h  i  density of the model ( spiral perturbation minus an underlying toomre disk ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](_a _ ) , overlaid with the spiral model of @xcite .",
    "the synthetic _",
    "l - v _ diagram , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](_b _ ) uses this spiral model , a @xcite rotation curve , and accounts for streaming motions around the spiral arms . the model is by no means definitive , but it does reproduce many of the dominant features in the observed _ l - v _ diagram . in particular , the synthetic _",
    "l - v _ diagram has a narrow ridge of emission at the most extreme positive velocities .",
    "the ridge corresponds to the spiral arm in the face - on diagram that passes through @xmath82 .",
    "another possibility is that the shape of the feature in _ l - v _ space can be explained by a non - circular motion of the lsr , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate the magnitude of the non - circular lsr to be @xmath83 @xmath14 .",
    "applying this correction shifts outer galaxy orbits away from the expected @xmath84 shape . with this correction the shape of the feature",
    "can be fit reasonably well with an orbit of galactocentric radius 16 kpc .",
    "though the shape of the feature can be fit by altering the lsr , the mere existence of a ridge of emission can not be explained by this motion .",
    "a similar alternative explanation is that the outer galaxy gas follows elliptical orbits , as suggested by @xcite . to estimate this effect we included elliptical orbits in our model _",
    "l - v _ diagram .",
    "@xcite found that galactic h  i  data are best fit by an elliptical disk with the sun near the minor axis of the potential and an equipotential axis ratio of 0.9 . applying this modification to our model _",
    "l - v _ diagram results in an outer envelope at positive velocities with a much steeper slope , @xmath85 , than is observed . to fit the observed feature with an elliptical orbit requires an axis ratio of 1.1 , which @xcite eliminate in their analysis . both @xcite and @xcite",
    "emphasize that there is little global evidence for ellipticity at @xmath86 .",
    "it therefore seems unlikely that the feature can be explained by an elliptical potential .",
    "a notable characteristic of this feature is that it shifts in velocity by about 10  @xmath14  between longitudes @xmath27 and @xmath28 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : lv ] . in the @xcite sketches of this arm it is absent between these longitudes .",
    "@xcite , however , detect high latitude ( @xmath87 ) emission at @xmath88 @xmath14  at these longitudes and suggest that the spiral arm arches to higher latitudes in this area .",
    "our data do not show a shift towards higher latitudes , but rather a shift towards higher velocities .",
    "it is interesting that these longitudes agree well with the galactic longitudes of the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc , smc ) and the leading arm of the magellanic stream . in models of the orbits of the magellanic clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the clouds should cross the galactic plane around @xmath39 .",
    "the relative proximity of the lmc , in particular , should have a significant dynamical effect on the outer milky way disk , and may create a velocity perturbation in the outer spiral arm .",
    "for example , models of the effects of the clouds on the milky way , such as that by @xcite , show that the eccentric orbit of the lmc can create radial velocity shifts on the order of 5 - 10 @xmath14  beyond the solar circle and in the direction of the clouds .",
    "the observed shift in the outer arm velocity may be such an effect .",
    "@xcite recently detected a large diffuse , low latitude stellar stream around the milky way between @xmath89 around @xmath90 kpc .",
    "the nature of this feature is still uncertain with suggestions that it is an outer spiral arm , a tidally disrupted satellite galaxy or a resonance @xcite .",
    "@xcite find several possibly associated stellar clusters that overlap the longitude range of the h  i  feature , but these have significantly smaller radial velocities , are less confined to the galactic midplane and are estimated to be at @xmath91 kpc , so we do not believe they are associated with the h  ifeature .",
    "using the sgps we have mapped a large , coherent feature at extreme positive velocities in the fourth quadrant of the milky way .",
    "the feature extends from @xmath18 , @xmath92 @xmath14  to at least @xmath22 , @xmath93 @xmath14 , placing it at galactic radii in excess of 18 kpc .",
    "the feature appears to be approximately 1 to 2 kpc thick both in @xmath37 and along the line - of - sight .",
    "we discuss several possible explanations for the origin of the feature , specifically that it is a pile - up in velocity space at @xmath61 due to an extended , smooth h  i  disk , and that it results from either a non - circular lsr or an elliptical potential .",
    "we exclude these and conclude that the feature is best described by a very distant spiral arm with a pitch angle of @xmath94 ."
