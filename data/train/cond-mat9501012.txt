    "in the study of the fluctuation of superconductors and the melting transition of the abrikosov flux lattice in a strong magnetic field , ginzburg - landau ( gl ) model is especially useful with the lowest landau level approximation .",
    "this approximation is valid in the region very near to @xmath4 and neglects all the contribution from upper landau levels except the lowest one , and reduces the effective dimension of the system by two due to the landau quantization perpendicular to the magnetic field axis .",
    "the perturbational studies @xcite-@xcite for gl free energy up to high orders are unable to find a flux lattice melting transition in two dimensions .",
    "however , the comparison of the low temperature expansion to the high temperature expansion for the free energy gives the estimation of the melting transition point@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the numerical studies such as monte carlo simulations show that there exists the first order transition in a finite temperature well below the mean field superconducting transition point @xmath4@xcite-@xcite .",
    "although both analytical and numerical calculations agree quite well in derivation of the statistical amounts , the nature of the melting transition of flux lattice is not yet fully understood @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the first order transition has been suggested by the renormalization group analysis@xcite , but two dimensions are far from the valid region around six dimensions .    in this study",
    "we generalize the gl hamiltonian to a gauged matrix model in which the order parameter is expressed by a complex @xmath5 matrix@xcite .",
    "the matrix model in the large @xmath0 limit attracts recently much theoretical interest since it has a close relation to the string field theory @xcite and has been studied in many fields such as @xmath6 quantum gravity coupled to matter field@xcite , mesoscopic fluctuations@xcite and electron correlations@xcite . in several matrix models",
    "the exact solutions have been obtained@xcite and these solutions give the clues to the perturbative analysis of other unsolved matrix models .",
    "it is known that the matrix model has a phase transition in the large @xmath0 limit when the coefficient of the quadratic term is negative or in the lattice gauge theory@xcite- @xcite .",
    "this may be true for our gauged matrix model and we are interested in how this phase transition is related to the superconducting flux lattice melting .",
    "usual ginzburg - landau model corresponds to @xmath7 case , but we generalize the order parameter to @xmath5 complex matrix and take the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "this large @xmath0 limit should be distinguished from the large @xmath0 case of the @xmath0-vector model@xcite , which becomes equivalent to the hartree- fock approximation and has no phase transition in two dimensions .    in the usual gl model ,",
    "the perturbation series becomes asymptotic expansions and one needs borel summation for such divergent series . in the large @xmath0 limit of gl matrix model ,",
    "the perturbation series about @xmath1 is convergent , and the precise analysis of the free energy becomes possible .",
    "thus it is natural to consider the solution of the gl matrix model in the large @xmath0 limit as a first approximation of the @xmath6 superconductor phase transition .",
    "we find indeed a phase transition point @xmath8 for the large @xmath0 limit of the gl matrix model and this point corresponds to @xmath9 in term of the reduced relative temperature . in the previous paper@xcite",
    ", we evaluated the flux lattice melting temperature for @xmath6 superconductors ( @xmath7 ) as @xmath10 by the analysis of the perturbation series of the usual gl free energy .",
    "although the phase transition for @xmath11 occurs in considerably higher temperature than the usual gl model of @xmath7 , we consider this difference may result from the first approximation for @xmath6 superconductors .",
    "the improvement of the evaluation of this phase transition point in the gauged matrix model is suggested by taking the higer order terms in @xmath12 expansion .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , a gauged matrix model with the interaction of ginzburg - landau type @xmath13 is introduced in the lowest landau level approximation and the free energy is obtained as the power series of coupling constant @xmath1 using the saddle point method . in section iii , the critical point of the free energy is obtained for the case the coefficient of @xmath14 term is negative .",
    "this phase transition is investigated in nature and in section iv the relation to the melting transition of flux lattice is discussed .",
    "in the ginzburg - landau model , the order parameter @xmath15 is a complex field and can be expanded with the landau levels .",
    "if the field is near the critical point @xmath4 , the lowest landau level approximation , which neglects all contributions to the order parameter from the upper landau levels and takes into account only the lowest one , is justified for the strong magnetic field due to the absence of mixing between landau levels .",
    "we consider this strong magnetic field case and generalize this complex order parameter @xmath15 to a complex matrix @xmath16 .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a rank @xmath0 complex matrix and @xmath19 .",
    "we denote the charge of superconductor by @xmath20 , and this charge @xmath20 is of course twice of the charge of a single electron . here",
    "the abelian gauge field @xmath21 is a vector potential of a magnetic field . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are usual gl parameters .",
    "we choose the landau gauge @xmath24 .",
    "the complex matrix @xmath18 is written by the projection to the lowest landau level as , @xmath25\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is a @xmath5 complex matrix and we put @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "then the hamiltonian is rewritten as @xmath29\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times & \\delta_{q_1 + q_2 , q_3 + q_4 } { \\rm tr } \\left [ m^\\ast ( q_1 ) m(q_3 ) m^\\ast ( q_2 ) m(q_4 ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is related to the reduced temperature @xmath31/t_c ( b)$ ] .",
    "the free energy @xmath32 is obtained @xmath33 @xmath34    the perturbation series for the free energy is expanded by a new variable defined by @xmath35 this is the same as the expansion parameter in @xmath7 case@xcite . since we have generalized the gl order parameter to a matrix variable , the perturbation series has a @xmath0-dependence . in the diagrammatic language , the planar diagrams are obtained in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "we have nonlocal interaction in eq.([eq : gauged ] ) and have to perform gaussian integration , which is equivalent to count the number of euler path @xmath36 of each diagrams@xcite .",
    "thus there appears additional factor @xmath37 to the combinatorial factor . in the large @xmath0 limit , we have to select only planar diagrams among various terms which have been worked before by considering @xmath0- dependence@xcite .    here",
    "we follow the new calculational method instead of the selecting planar diagrams as proposed in ref.@xcite . except the factor @xmath36 of the number of euler path ,",
    "the combinatorial factor of each diagram in the planar limit becomes the same as one matrix model .",
    "there is no difference between a complex matrix model and a hermitian matrix model in the leading order except a trivial factor @xmath38 .",
    "it has been recognized that the renormalized expansion simplifies remarkably the diagramatic expansion for matrix models : one needs to consider only the irreducible diagrams to obtain the perturbation series of the free energy .",
    "this renormalized expansion can be applied successfully to our case , since the extra factor @xmath37 due to the euler path is factorized .",
    "this factorization is easily understood for any diagrams by the definition of euler path .",
    "therefore , we follow the procedure of the renormalized expansion method @xcite , which gives a remarkably simplified method for the perturbation expansion .    we introduce the equivalent @xmath39-real vector model which is expressed by the @xmath40 dimensional real vector field @xmath41 and the effective hamiltonian for large-@xmath0 limit is written as @xmath42 where @xmath43 note that @xmath44 is the sum of the square of the absolute value for the matrix element .",
    "we integrate out the angular variables of this @xmath39- dimensional coordinates by keeping the radial part @xmath45 .",
    "we choose the appropriate coefficients @xmath46 so as to make the free energy in the large @xmath0 limit becomes the same as that of the original gauged matrix model defined by eq.([eq : gauged ] ) .",
    "this coefficient @xmath46 turns out to be determined by the irreducible diagrams in the original matrix model .    by the saddle point method , the free energy for the hamiltonian eq.([eq : gauged ] )",
    "becomes in the large @xmath0 limit , @xmath47 where we have replaced @xmath48 .",
    "the saddle point equation is derived as @xmath49 this relation is also expressed simply by @xmath50 where we define @xmath51    the relevant irreducible diagrams in each order of @xmath1 is reduced much in number and in table i we give these numbers of diagrams .",
    "the self - energy part is completely renormalized into the quantity @xmath52 and only irreducible diagrams should be taken into account .",
    "in other words , our irreducible diagrams do not contain the self - energy diagrams .",
    "we briefly explain how we obtain the irreducible planar diagrams : we generate @xmath53-th order planar irreducible diagrams from @xmath54-th order ones by cutting two lines and add one vertex .",
    "the choice of two lines to be cut is restricted by the condition that generated next order diagrams should also be planar , and the directions of the lines are uniquely determined also by this condition .",
    "firstly we make the generated graphs undirected and drop all the isomorphic graphs obtained by this process .",
    "then for the remaining graphs , we choose properly directed graphs and calculate the combinatorial factor by counting the number of isomorphisms of the graphs .",
    "the number of euler path of a given graph is determined by evaluating the determinant of the adjacency matrix@xcite . in fig.1",
    "we show planar irreducible diagrams to eighth order , where the direction of the line ( arrow ) is not shown and the line is denoted simply by a sigle line instead of double lines .    up to the eighth order",
    "we obtain the perturbation series as @xmath55 where the coefficients are evaluated solely from the irreducible diagrams",
    ".    it may be instructive to see how this renormalized expansion method gives an efficient result for the case of one matrix model where the exact solution is known : we now consider the case without a magnetic field in @xmath56 dimension . in the one matrix model ,",
    "the hamiltonian becomes with hermitian matrix @xmath57 @xmath58 from which we obtain the perturbation series for the free energy in the large @xmath0 limit with the same irreducible diagrams .",
    "( here we omit the factor @xmath37 for the euler path . ) since @xmath57 is hermitian in eq.([eq : hamil_one ] ) , there appears a difference of a factor @xmath38 compared to the complex matrix case except the number @xmath36 of euler path , @xmath59 the saddle point equation is given by @xmath60 from eq.([eq : onemat ] ) we obtain for @xmath61 , @xmath62 in the iteration for small @xmath1 with eq.([eq : wai ] ) , @xmath63 is reexpressed as @xmath64 by the investigation of the ratio of the coefficients in the series eq.([eq : x2 ] ) , we find that the ratio @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "then we have a following closed equation , @xmath68 + { gy\\over 3}.\\ ] ] from this result , we can determine the coefficients of the free energy in eq.([eq : onemat ] ) up to any order of @xmath1 for the one matrix model .",
    "we now come back to the case with a strong magnetic field . including the factor @xmath37 of euler path",
    ", we are able to check the result of eq.([eq : gmatfree ] ) comparing with eq.([eq : onemat ] ) .",
    "we repeat the same procedure as the one matrix model . from eq.([eq : gmatfree ] ) the saddle point equation becomes @xmath69 we rewrite this equation by the iteration for small @xmath1 as @xmath70 using the relation of eq.([eq : saddleq ] ) ( note @xmath71 is defined by @xmath72 ) , the free energy is obtained in the large @xmath0 limit , @xmath73 we correct here the result of the previous calculation of order @xmath74 and @xmath75 in ref.@xcite , where small deviation was represented .",
    "it is remarkable that we easily obtain the series expansion by considering rather small diagrams .",
    "our main object is to apply the matrix model to the investigation of the flux lattice melting transition of a superconductor in a strong magnetic field for two dimensions .",
    "hereafter we consider the gauged matrix model with negative mass @xmath76 and positive coupling case @xmath77 .    from the study of the large @xmath0 limit of the two dimensional @xmath78 lattice gauge theory @xcite and one matrix model@xcite ,",
    "it is known that there is a critical point of @xmath1 and the free energy shows different behaviors in the small coupling ( @xmath79 ) and the strong coupling ( @xmath80 ) regions .",
    "also the third derivative of the free energy with respect to the temperature becomes discontinuous at this point and third order phase transitions are observed in these models .",
    "this phase transition is equivalent to the freezing of the saddle point value of @xmath81 . in the equivalent @xmath82- vector model representation , @xmath81 is frozen below this critical point as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a certain negative value to be determined .",
    "we again go back to the relation between @xmath85 and @xmath86 . from eq.([eq : gmatfree ] ) @xmath71 is expanded by @xmath87 this relation remains true even when we introduce the negative @xmath88 .",
    "we reexpress this perturbation series as @xmath89    for the discussion of the region below the mean field transition temperature , @xmath76 , we write the free energy with an explicit @xmath88-dependence in the term of order @xmath81 , @xmath90 in this case , we change the definition of @xmath1 from the previous one eq.([eq : defg ] ) to @xmath91 the saddle point equation becomes , @xmath92 thus we have for the temperature @xmath76 , with eq.([eq : ansatz ] ) @xmath93    as shown in ref.@xcite , the critical point is obtained exactly for the one matrix model from the exact equation of eq.([eq : exact ] ) by insertion of eq.([eq : ansatz ] ) and @xmath94 . for our present model",
    ", the exact equation is unknown .",
    "thus we approximate eq.([eq : gx2 ] ) , which corresponds to eq.([eq : exact ] ) for one matrix model by the pad form , and repeat the same analysis which determines the critical point .",
    "approximated pad form of eq.([eq : gx2 ] ) becomes @xmath95 $ pad\\'e}.\\ ] ] we put eq.([eq : sadl2 ] ) into this equation then we have @xmath96 where @xmath97 and the coefficients @xmath98 are obtained by the pad coefficients in eq.([eq : pade ] ) .",
    "the degenerate solution of @xmath99 is obtained when the line @xmath100 becomes tangent to the curve given by the r.h.s .",
    "of eq.([eq : plot ] ) ( fig.2 ) .",
    "this degenerate solution gives the critical point @xmath101 .",
    "we apply various pad methods for the r.h.s of eq.([eq : plot ] ) . in table",
    "ii we list the critical point @xmath101 as a pad table form . from this table",
    "we see that the convergency of the pad which involve even number of terms of original series is good . in the case",
    "that @xmath102 , there appears a pole in the positive @xmath99 and we consider the critical point is effected by this pole .",
    "we find the transition point @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 by @xmath106 $ ] pad .    in the one matrix model",
    ", we have an explicit expression which corresponds to eq.([eq : plot ] ) as @xcite @xmath107 + { 1\\over 12 } + { z\\over 12}\\ ] ] and the exact transition point @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the exponent @xmath111 is of course related to the critical exponent of the free energy , @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the exponent of the string susceptibility @xmath114 . in our case , this string susceptibility exponent is considered to be zero , since our system has a central charge @xmath115 as shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "thus , we expect that the singularity of the r.h.s .",
    "of eq.([eq : plot ] ) at the negative @xmath101 becomes @xmath116 .",

    "in this paper , we have developed a new series expansion for the matrix ginzburg- landau model and in the large @xmath0 limit , we have obtained a phase transition which corresponds to the superconductor transition in two dimensions .",

    "also it is interesting to perform the numerical simulation by langevin method or monte carlo method for the matrix ginzburg- landau model and to find the melting transition point which depends upon @xmath0 .",
    "we will represent this simulation result elsewhere .    as a theoretical interest",
    ", our matrix model may be interesting in several points .",
    "( i ) in one matrix model , the phase transition corresponds to the singularity of the density of state , where the density of the eigenvalue of the hermitian matrix has a gap at the band center@xcite .",
    "our gauged model is considered to be similar , although the eigenvalue representation is difficult due to the complex matrix .",
    "( ii)the matrix model in the large @xmath0 limit represents the string behavior as a random surface in the double scaling limit at the negative @xmath1 .",
    "we have discussed the phase transition at a positive @xmath1 , and also the double scaling limit is expected at the phase transition point . in the superconductor ,",
    "the vortex is a string , and it is interesting to think the phase transition , which we found in the large @xmath0 limit , is related to the string theory .",
    "we note that in a different context , the analogy of the phase transition in a strong magnetic field to string theory has been discussed@xcite . as same as other matrix models@xcite",
    ", the transition may correspond to the condensation , like ideal bose - einstein gas .",
    "it is interesting to consider further the tachyon condensation for our phase transition .",
    "our result of the new renormalized expansion becomes useful for the phase transition on a random surface in the case of the central charge @xmath158 .",
    "( iii ) in the presence of the impurity , the melting phase transition is considered to be a second order @xcite , and a vortex glass or a gauge glass phase appears instead of the abrikosov vortex lattice phase .",
    "this gauge glass phase has no long range order .",
    "it is interesting to note that for the matrix model in the large @xmath0 limit , below the phase transition point , there is no symmetry breaking , as seen in the density of state of the eigenvalue .",
    "the density of state has a gap , but still symmetric for the positive and negative eigenvalue .",
    "this is a common behavior seen in freezing phase transitions @xcite .",
    "thus a matrix model in the large @xmath0 limit may become a model of a gauge glass state in the two dimensional superconductor in a magnetic field , in which the freezing transition is essential .",
