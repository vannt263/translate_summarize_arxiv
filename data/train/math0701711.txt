    "_ c - loops _ are loops satisfying the identity @xmath2 as we shall see , they are in a sense dual to moufang loops  the most intensively studied variety of loops  and they are closely related to steiner triple systems .",
    "they are thus important both algebraically and combinatorially , and they are amenable to analysis by techniques from both fields . but in spite of this , little is known about them .",
    "it is the intention of this paper to remedy this situation by laying a foundation for the systematic study of c - loops .",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with the reasoning and notational conventions of loop theory , however , we do not hesitate to include loop - theoretical folklore and to point out some of the pitfalls of nonassociativity  mostly because we fell into many of them ourselves .",
    "c - loops were named by ferenc fenyves @xcite , who investigated the inclusions between varieties of loops of _ bol - moufang type_. these are varieties of loops defined by a single identity that : ( i ) involves three distinct variables on both sides , ( ii ) contains variables in the same order on both sides , ( iii ) exactly one of the variables appears twice on both sides .",
    "fenyves s program was completed by the authors in @xcite",
    ". there are 60 identities of bol - moufang type , and they happen to define 14 distinct varieties of loops .",
    "figure [ fg : l ] gives the hasse diagram of these varieties , with the largest varieties ( with respect to inclusion ) at the bottom .",
    "a superficial glance at the diagram suggests that c - loops could behave analogously to moufang loops .",
    "this impression is further strengthened by the fact that c - loops are exactly those loops that are both lc - loops and rc - loops ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4 ) , just as moufang loops are exactly those loops that are both left bol and right bol @xcite .",
    "there are additional analogies , especially between commutative moufang loops and commutative c - loops , as we shall see .",
    "in combinatorics , moufang loops have connections to projective geometry ( moufang planes , moufang polygons , etc . , cf .",
    "@xcite ) , while c - loops have connections to steiner triple systems :    consider the complete graph @xmath3 on @xmath4 vertices .",
    "steiner triple system _ is a decomposition of the edges of @xmath3 into disjoint triangles .",
    "it is well known ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that such a decomposition exists if and only if @xmath5 or @xmath6 ; the case @xmath7 being degenerate .",
    "there is a canonical way of constructing a quasigroup from a steiner triple system .",
    "namely , if @xmath8 is a steiner triple system , we define multiplication on @xmath9 by @xmath10 , and ( for @xmath11 ) by @xmath12 if and only if @xmath13 is a triangle of @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting quasigroup clearly satisfies @xmath15 conversely , any quasigroup satisfying @xmath16 gives rise to a steiner triple system in a canonical way ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "quasigroups satisfying @xmath16 are therefore called _",
    "steiner quasigroups_.    any steiner quasigroup can be made into a loop by introducing a new element @xmath17 and by letting @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "such loops satisfy @xmath20 and are called _",
    "steiner loops_. it is now clear that the steiner quasigroup that gave rise to a steiner loop @xmath21 can be reconstructed from @xmath21 .",
    "steiner loops are therefore in one - to - one correspondence with steiner triple systems , too .    intuitively , the reason why c - loops are related to steiner loops is the presence of the term @xmath22 in the defining equation @xmath23 . more formally :    [ lm : cs ] every steiner loop is a c - loop .",
    "note that @xmath24 is a part of the definition @xmath25 , and that @xmath26 follows from @xmath25 immediately by commutativity .",
    "thus @xmath27 .",
    "not every c - loop is a steiner loop , as is witnessed by any nonabelian group .",
    "another connection between c - loops and steiner loops becomes apparent upon investigating the nucleus of c - loops .",
    "recall that for a loop @xmath21 , the set @xmath28 for every @xmath29 , @xmath30 is called the _ left nucleus_. similarly , the _ middle nucleus _ @xmath31",
    "consists of all elements @xmath32 satisfying @xmath33 for every @xmath29 , @xmath34 ; and the _ right nucleus _ @xmath35 consists of all elements @xmath32 satisfying @xmath36 for every @xmath29 , @xmath37 .",
    "the _ nucleus _ @xmath38 of @xmath21 is a subgroup of @xmath21 .",
    "there are several equivalent ways in which normality can be defined for loops .",
    "the following definition works best with elementary calculations .",
    "a subloop @xmath39 of a loop @xmath21 is said to be _ normal _ in @xmath21 if @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 for every @xmath43 , @xmath44 . the _ factor loop _",
    "@xmath45 is then defined in the usual way .",
    "a loop @xmath21 with neutral element @xmath17 is a _ left inverse property loop _ if @xmath46 for every @xmath43 , @xmath44 , where @xmath47 is the unique element satisfying @xmath48 .",

    "a loop that has both the left and right inverse property is an _",
    "inverse property loop_.    if @xmath32 is such that @xmath52 for every @xmath29 , we have @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , inverse property loops possess _ two - sided inverses _",
    "( i.e. , @xmath54 ) , and it is easy to check that they satisfy the _ antiautomorphic inverse property _ ( i.e. , @xmath55 .",
    "pflugfelder shows @xcite that steiner loops are exactly commutative inverse property loops of exponent 2 .",
    "in fact , steiner loops are exactly inverse property loops of exponent 2 .",
    "this fact belongs to loop - theoretical folklore and is sometimes used as a definition of steiner loops ( cf .",
    "since we did not manage to find a reference for the proof , here it is :    [ lm : folklore ] steiner loops are exactly inverse property loops of exponent two .",

    "conversely , let @xmath21 be an inverse property loop of exponent @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath57 .",

    "also notice that @xmath18 is not necessary in the definition @xmath25 of steiner loop , since @xmath61 .",
    "hence steiner loops are exactly loops satisfying @xmath62 quasigroups satisfying @xmath63 are called _ totally symmetric _ , and thus steiner loops can also be found under the name _ totally symmetric loops _ in the literature .",
