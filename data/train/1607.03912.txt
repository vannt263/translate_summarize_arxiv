    "ground states of strongly interacting electronic systems can exhibit an extremely rich variety of phases .",
    "one way to organize our understanding is to classify the zero temperature phases by their entanglement structure at long distances and low energies @xcite .",
    "gapped phases which possess a local order parameter are characterized by short - range entanglement , that is , the reduced density matrix of a large subsystem @xmath8 can be understood simply by patching together density matrices of smaller subsystems @xmath9 whose union is @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this is no longer true for gapless phases such as fermi liquids @xcite , or gapped topological phases such as a fractional quantum hall liquid , and such phases are thus said to possess ` long - range entanglement ' @xcite .",
    "experience as well as heuristic arguments suggest that hamiltonians whose ground states posess long range entanglement are relatively difficult to simulate on a classical computer .",
    "for example , even a phase as ubiquitous and as well understood as a fermi liquid is rather hard to simulate numerically because fermions at finite density with repulsive interactions tend to have an intricate sign structure in their wavefunctions leading to the infamous monte carlo fermion sign problem @xcite .",
    "similarly , fractional quantum hall phases again possess a non - trivial sign structure to their wavefunctions @xcite , and therefore so far are amenable only via techniques such as exact diagonalization @xcite and density matrix rg @xcite , which are restricted to only small two - dimensional systems due to exponential scaling of numerical cost with system size .",
    "however , there do exist long - range entangled phases that do not suffer from monte carlo sign problem .",
    "two prominent examples are : ( 1 ) interacting dirac fermions with an even number of flavors @xcite ( 2 ) a gapped @xmath5 topological ordered system such as a toric code hamiltonian @xcite in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the absence of sign problem for the former is related to the positive fermion determinant , while in the latter case , the hamiltonian has non - positive off - diagonal elements in a local basis , allowing one to sample the corresponding boltzmann weight efficiently @xcite . in this paper , we study a sign problem free model that has a ground state with features of both of the aforementioned long range entangled phases together , namely , dirac fermions coupled to a fluctuating @xmath5 gauge field . by tuning parameters in the hamiltonian , we also study competition with symmetry breaking short - range entangled phases which leads to novel strongly interacting quantum critical phenomena .    .",
    "we observe a @xmath5 dirac deconfined phase ( @xmath10d ) , a spin - density wave ( sdw ) phase ( @xmath11 nel phase ) ( or a superconductor ( sc ) , depending on the pattern of particle - hole symmetry breaking ) , a charge density wave ( cdw ) phase as well as a valence bond solid ( vbs ) . for @xmath12",
    ", we do not find evidence for a @xmath10d phase beyond @xmath13 consistent with the arguments in the main text .",
    "the phase transitions from the @xmath10d to sdw / sc ( @xmath6 ) and vbs ( @xmath7 ) are seemingly continuous . at @xmath7",
    "we observe a deconfined quantum critical point ( dcqp ) between the vbs and sdw phases . ]",
    "our hamiltonian ( eq.[model.eq ] ) is partially motivated by a recent study of nematic instability of a fermi surface @xcite and velocity fluctuations in dirac metals @xcite .",
    "it consists of @xmath0 species of fermions on the vertices of a square lattice interacting with quantum ising spins that live on the links of the same square lattice .",
    "however , in contrast to the hamiltonian in ref .",
    "@xcite , our hamiltonian has a local @xmath5 invariance , which leads to @xmath14 conserved operators on a @xmath15 lattice .",
    "furthermore , we restrict ourselves to half - filling and thus at low energies , instead of a fermi surface , we either obtain either no fermions ( e.g. a mott insulator ) or fermi points .",
    "these differences completely alter the phase diagram of our model compared to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the phase diagram for various values of @xmath0 is summarized in fig.[phase.fig ] . for @xmath3",
    ", we find that when the kinetic energy of the aforementioned ising spins is small compared to the kinetic energy of the fermions , the ground state resembles deconfined phase of the @xmath5 gauge theory coupled to @xmath4 dirac fermions ( the @xmath12 case is special in that the deconfined fermions are unstable to infinitesimal interactions ) .",
    "however , as we will discuss in detail , there is an important distinction between this phase and the deconfined phase of a conventional @xmath5 gauge matter theory ( ref .",
    "namely , the local @xmath5 invariance in our model is an _ actual _ symmetry of the hamiltonian in contrast to the so - called ` gauge symmetry ' in gauge - matter theories which just corresponds to _ redundancy _ in the description of the physical states .",
    "this is because we _ do not _ project the hilbert space of our hamiltonian to gauge invariant states , that is , we do not impose the gauss s law . instead , in our model , the gauss s law in the ground state emerges due to spontaneous symmetry breaking as the locally conserved operators order in a certain definite pattern . one physical significance of this is that in contrast to regular @xmath5 gauge theory , in our model , equal space , unequal time non - gauge invariant correlation functions _ do not _ vanish identically .",
    "further , there is a finite temperature ising transition corresponding to the restoration of the aforementioned symmetry .    as the kinetic energy of the ising degrees of freedom",
    "is increased , we find that the aforementioned gapless dirac deconfined phase enters a symmetry broken confined phase . the nature of symmetry breaking depends on the value of @xmath0 . for @xmath12",
    "it corresponds to a charge density wave , while for @xmath6 , due to an enlarged symmetry , the symmetry broken phase can correspond to a superconductor or a spin density wave , depending on the sign of infinitesimal symmetry breaking field .",
    "the @xmath7 case is even richer .",
    "we find that after exiting the deconfined phase , the model enters a valence bond solid ( vbs ) phase , and as the tuning parameter controlling the kinetic energy of ising spins is tuned further , the valence - bond solid quantum melts and yields a anti - ferromagnet phase .",
    "the phase transition between the vbs and nel phase , if second - order , will correspond to a deconfined quantum critical point @xcite , reported earlier in the context of quantum magnets @xcite .",
    "our results are consistent with a second order transition .",
    "our model reads : @xmath16 here , @xmath17 creates a fermion of flavor @xmath18 in a wannier state centered around lattice site @xmath19 of a square lattice and the sum runs over bonds of nearest neighbors .",
    "each bond , @xmath20 , accommodates a two level system spanned by the hilbert space @xmath21 and @xmath22 and in this basis , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , corresponds to the pauli spin matrices @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "@xmath27 tunes the strength of the transverse field . note that we have set the coefficient of the hopping term to unity so that all energy scales , including the size of @xmath27 and the temperature @xmath28 , will be measured relative to the hopping term .",
    "the model ( eq.[model.eq ] ) leads to a number of symmetries .",
    "the particle - hole symmetry we consider is @xmath29 and it satisfies @xmath30   = 0.\\ ] ] as an explicit operator , @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "thus it is a fermionic ( bosonic ) operator if the total number of lattice sites is odd ( even ) . as it will become clearer later in the paper , it is helpful to define a @xmath5 valued order - parameter @xmath33 that captures the breaking of the particle - hole symmetry ,    @xmath34    this is nothing but the parity of fermion particle number at site @xmath19 . under particle - hole transformation , @xmath35 .",
    "a more interesting symmetry corresponds to the local conservation laws :    @xmath36   = 0\\ ] ]    where    @xmath37    with @xmath38=   0 $ ] and @xmath39 . despite an extensive number of conservation laws ,",
    "our hamiltonian is _ not _ integrable .",
    "this is because the total number of degrees of freedom , @xmath40 , after taking into account @xmath14 number of conserved @xmath41 s on a @xmath15 lattice , are still extensive : @xmath42 number of ising spins @xmath43 number of fermions @xmath44 number of constraints @xmath45 .",
    "crucially , the operators @xmath41 anti - commute with the generator of particle - hole symmetry : @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , the low energy theory of our model can not contain terms that are proportional to @xmath41 unless the particle - hole symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the anti - commutation also implies that the energy eigenstates can not simultaneously be particle - hole symmetric and eigenstates of @xmath41 .",
    "in particular , particle - hole symmetric eigenstates satisfy @xmath47 . however , it s worth emphasizing that even if an energy eigenstate is not particle - hole symmetric , it does not necessarily break the particle - hole symmetry _",
    "spontaneously_. for example , one can in principle construct a state @xmath48 which is an eigenstate of all @xmath41 s , ( and therefore can not be eigenstate of @xmath49 for any @xmath18 ) , but nevertheless satisfies @xmath50 , and @xmath51 as @xmath52 .",
    "another consequence of anticommutation between @xmath41 and @xmath49 is that the spectra of the hamiltonian is at least doubly degenerate .",
    "in fact , on a lattice with an odd number of total sites , the hamiltonian possesses a @xmath53 susy @xcite .",
    "this is because , as discussed in @xmath49 is a fermionic operator and together with bosonic operator @xmath54 can be used to define a fermionic susy generator @xmath55 for any @xmath18 and @xmath56 , so that @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 = 0 $ ] .    at this point",
    "it is important to pause and note that even though our hamiltonian ( eqn.[model.eq ] ) bears a strong resemblance to a @xmath5 gauge theory coupled to matter fields @xcite , ours is actually not a gauge theory due to an important difference . unlike a matter - gauge theory , we _",
    "do not _ impose the gauss s law constraint at any site . in a conventional @xmath5 gauge theory",
    ", the field @xmath60 would correspond to the @xmath5 electric field along direction @xmath61 at site @xmath19 , and thus the gauss s law ( ` @xmath62 ' ) reads : @xmath63 .",
    "satisfying this operator equation would thus require projecting the hamiltonian to a specific set of eigenvalues of operators @xmath41 ( namely , @xmath64 charge @xmath65 so that the constraint is @xmath66 ) .",
    "in contrast , we do not impose any constraint on @xmath41 s , which therefore behave like classical degrees of freedom , whose values are allowed to vary from one eigenstate to another , and for a given many - body eigenstate these values will be determined by the intrinsic dynamics of our hamiltonian .",
    "the local conservation of @xmath41 has important consequences . since @xmath67",
    ", one can readily show that @xmath68 or equivalently @xmath69 thus , a bare single fermion @xmath70 as well as the ising operator @xmath71 , are localized along the real space axis , but can propagate along the imaginary time direction .",
    "propagation along the imaginary time implies transitions between different @xmath41 sectors which is not prohibited in our model . as already mentioned ,",
    "if one were to instead impose a constraint on the values of @xmath41 , it would prohibit propagation along the time direction as well , leading to a local @xmath5 gauge redundancy .    on the other hand , quantities such as @xmath72 where one attaches a string of @xmath73-operators along certain chosen bonds connecting @xmath74 to @xmath75 , as well as closed paths of @xmath73-operators , or the expectation value of @xmath76 are all quantities which do not vanish due to symmetry arguments .",
    "again , since the hilbert space is not restricted to a single choice of @xmath77 the strings are continuous in space but can be discontinuous in the imaginary time .",
    "the model is clearly invariant under global u(@xmath0 ) rotations in flavor space : @xmath78 where @xmath79 corresponds to an u(@xmath0 ) matrix .",
    "we recall that u(@xmath0 ) = @xmath80 where the su(@xmath0 ) component corresponds to the rotations among the @xmath0-flavors and the u(1 ) corresponds to the global particle number conservation @xmath81 .",
    "in fact , the full set of continuous symmetries is bigger than u(@xmath0 ) and corresponds to o(2@xmath0 ) .",
    "this symmetry is manifest if one makes a unitary transformation @xmath82 on only one of the sublattices of the square lattice , and then writes the complex fermions in terms of their majorana components : @xmath83 .",
    "the hamiltonian then becomes :    @xmath84    which is manifestly o(2@xmath0 ) invariant .",
    "since we are in two spatial dimensions , the aforementioned global continuous symmetry can break spontaneously at zero temperature . in many of the examples we will discuss",
    ", the symmetry breaking will be manifest in long - ranged correlation functions such as : @xmath85 here @xmath86 are the generators of the subgroup su(n ) of the aforementioned o(2@xmath0 ) symmetry .    before moving on",
    ", we note that the discrete particle - hole symmetry provides exact mapping between seemingly different correlations functions .",
    "for example , let us consider the transverse ( @xmath87 ) spin operator @xmath88 hence , the particle - hole condensate at @xmath89 is equivalent to a particle - particle condensate at @xmath90 .",
    "equivalently , a charge density wave at @xmath91 transforms to a diagonal spin - density wave at the same wave vector .",
    "in this limit , we can understand the model in terms of a su - schrieffer - heeger coupling @xcite to an einstein phonon mode of frequency @xmath27 , but with a truncated phonon hilbert space .",
    "this reading of the model is certainly valid in the high frequency limit where phonon modes are not highly occupied . in particular , and in the @xmath92 basis",
    ", we can represent the ising spins in terms of hard core bosons : @xmath93 at high frequencies , the occupation of the bosonic level will be small so that one can safely relax the hard - core boson constraint , @xmath94 , and promote the bosonic operators to soft core ones . in this approximation ,",
    "the analogy to phonons is exact .",
    "integrating out the phonons leads to a retarded interaction resulting in the action : @xmath95 with @xmath96 the local hopping term , and @xmath97 the bosonic propagator for @xmath98 . in the high frequency limit and for constant values of @xmath99",
    "the interaction becomes instantaneous @xmath100 and the full hamiltonian reduces to @xmath101 this interaction was recently considered in the context of su(@xmath0 ) fermions on the honeycomb lattice in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the form in eq .",
    "[ h_inf.eq ] is easy to understand . in the strong coupling limit ,",
    "the ising spins are polarized along the @xmath102-direction , and fermion hopping is prohibited since this implies flipping of the spin against the transverse field .",
    "virtual processes can nevertheless occur and generate a super exchange energy scale @xmath103 .",
    "it is instructive to consider the nature of phases in this limit for a few values of @xmath0 .",
    "first , at large @xmath0 , the hamiltonian @xmath104 in eq.[h_inf.eq ] can be solved exactly ( ref.@xcite ) and the ground state corresponds to a valence bond solid state . for @xmath12 case ,",
    "the hamiltonian is simply @xmath105 and",
    "thus the ground state corresponds to a charge - density wave . for @xmath6 case",
    ", one finds @xmath106 here @xmath107 is the spin-1/2 operator and @xmath108 is the ` anderson s pseudospin ' @xcite , note that on a general lattice , the second term would instead be @xmath109 . on a bipartite lattice , such as ours ,",
    "one can do a unitary transformation to bring it to the form in eq.[eq : hstrongh ] ] . in the strong coupling limit charge",
    "is localized and the ising spins are frozen in the @xmath102-direction wave functions .",
    "such functions have well defined quantum numbers @xmath41 .",
    "if one choses @xmath110 , then the ground state will be a nel state for the fermions while the ising spins point along the x - direction .",
    "it is interesting to note that at @xmath111 the kinetic energy vanishes and that all real space charge configurations and thereby all @xmath112 sectors are degenerate .      in the @xmath113 limit ,",
    "the imaginary time scale on which the ising spins can fluctuate diverges such that the ising spin degrees of freedom become classical .",
    "the model then reduces to @xmath114 and one has to find an arrangement of ising spins which will minimize the energy .",
    "local @xmath5 invariance implies that the energy of an eigenstate depends only on the @xmath5 flux @xmath115 through a plaquette : @xmath116 lieb s work @xcite implies that the minimal energy is realized by @xmath117-flux configurations i.e. @xmath118 .",
    "this means that the coupling to the fermions effectively generates a @xmath5 _ magnetic field _",
    "term @xmath119 in the hamiltonian .    .",

    "this huge ground state degeneracy can also be thought of as a result of the conserved quantities @xmath41 that relate different ground states . to see the effect of @xmath117-flux on fermions ,",
    "let us chose a two orbital unit cell with unit vectors @xmath121 such that the intra - unit cell ising field is @xmath122 while all others are set to @xmath123 . as mentioned above , the single particle spectral function depends on the specific choice of ising fields . on the other hand ,",
    "the two particle green functions in the particle - hole channel are independent of the background ising configuration . in fig .",
    "[ sqom_h0.fig ] , we plot the ground state dynamical spin - spin correlations function , @xmath124 , valid for all @xmath0 .",
    "one observes a _ particle - hole _ continuum with gapless excitations at wave vectors connecting the dirac cones @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "one key interest of the qmc simulations will be to study the fate of this _ particle - hole _ continuum at non - zero values of @xmath27 .    as one might expect , and in accord with the third law of thermodynamics , quantum fluctuations will lift the zero temperature finite entropy density . in general , at non - zero values of @xmath27 terms which do not violate symmetries of the model will be dynamically generated . in particular , alongside the magnetic field term of eq .",
    "[ mf.eq ] one can write down , @xmath127 which is invariant under the particle - hole symmetry that sends @xmath128 .",
    "since this is nothing but a classical ising hamiltonian , one can foresee that there will likely be a finite temperature ising transition below which the @xmath54 s spontaneously order .",
    "as discussed in the following sections , this symmetry breaking will result in an emergent @xmath5 gauge structure in the ground state phase diagram and would also determine the nature of both confined and deconfined phases .",
    "in the majorana representation of eq .  [ modelmaj.eq ] the o(2@xmath0 ) symmetry of our model is manifest . as a consequence ,",

    ", in contrast , the auxiliary field corresponds to the z - component of the ising field , and its imaginary time dynamics is controlled by the transverse field .",
    "we have adopted a single spin flip algorithm , which turns out to be efficient ( high acceptance rates ) at large values of @xmath27 where the field oscillates rapidly in imaginary time . at weak couplings ,",

    "we note that the z@xmath145d to sdw transition observed in the su(2 ) model is equally characterized by a large value anomalous exponent which within the @xmath297-expansion reads @xmath341 . in the vicinity of the transition ( see fig .",
    "[ spin_dynamics_su2.fig ] a ) and b ) ) broad features at the antiferromagnetic wave vector are again apparent .",
    "the data set at @xmath333 ( see fig .  [ dyn_su3.fig]e ) ) corresponds to the strong coupling limit where the spin wave velocity vanishes as @xmath342 . upon comparison between the data sets of fig .",
    "[ dyn_su3.fig]d ) and e ) one notices a marked reduction of the spin wave velocity .",
    "another striking feature of the data , is the lack of a sharp spin - wave mode as seen in the su(2 ) case at our strongest coupling ( see fig .",
    "[ spin_dynamics_su2.fig]e ) ) .",
    "in fact in the vicinity of the @xmath125 , one detects two distinct features .",
    "we interpret this in terms of charge fluctuations around the mean - field spin - density wave state of eq .",
    "[ neelsu3.eq ] . setting @xmath343 in this equation and applying hamiltonian",
    "@xmath344 will generate spin - flip excitations on bonds with @xmath345 .",
    "this set of excitations lead to the spin - density wave mode .",
    "one will however equally generate charge fluctuations where one site of the bond is left empty and the other accommodates three particles .",
    "we interpret the additional features observed in the data in terms of these charge fluctuations . at @xmath111",
    "spin and charge excitations are degenerate and the spin wave velocity as well as the energy cost of the charge excitation are tied to the same scale @xmath342 such that we can not dissociate both features . furthermore one easily sees that such charge fluctuations do not occur in the su(2 ) case , where we observe a sharp spin - wave mode ( fig.[spin_dynamics_su2.fig]e ) .",
    "perhaps the most attractive feature of our model ( eq.[model.eq ] ) is that despite its simplicity and the absence of fermion sign problem , the phase diagram is rather rich ( fig.[phase.fig ] ) and features several highly entangled phases and quantum phase transitions . in particular , in the @xmath5 deconfined phase ,",
    "topological degrees of freedom , namely , the dynamically generated @xmath5 gauge field is coupled to gapless fermions . from an entanglement perspective",
    ", the @xmath5 dirac phase will result in sharp universal footprints in their entanglement structure and this provides an attractive opportunity to apply some of the recently developed techniques to calculate entanglement entropies and entanglement spectrum @xcite .",
    "specifically , the universal part of the entanglement in the @xmath5 dirac phase is expected to follow the relation @xmath346 where @xmath347 is the universal value for the same shaped region in a regular dirac phase @xcite .",
    "it would be similarly interesting to study the entanglement structure at the transition from z@xmath145d to symmetry broken phases for @xmath6 and @xmath7 , as well as at the deconfined critical point between sdw and vbs .    the transitions from z@xmath145d phase to the sdw / sc for @xmath6 and to vbs for @xmath7 are rather exotic since they appear to be continuous while involving both symmetry breaking , and confinement of the gauge field .",
    "we do nt have an understanding of these transitions and it s a worthwhile direction to pursue .",
    "although our model is not microscopically motivated by any specific material(s ) , the resulting phenomenology does share several features with spin - liquid candidate materials @xcite which also exhibit broad , non - quasiparticle features in their excitation spectrum .",
    "it is also worth noting that there have been recent proposals for realizing dynamical gauge - matter theories in cold atomic lattices where instead of imposing the gauge constraint as a penalty term , the hamiltonians such as ours ( eq.[model.eq ] ) appear naturally due to angular momentum conservation @xcite .",
    "our model features an interesting interplay of several symmetries  an extensive number of conserved operators @xmath41 that anti - commute with the particle - hole symmetry , as well as continuous o(2n ) symmetry that allows one to perform sign free monte carlo for all n. the particle - hole symmetry is the reason that our model hosts a finite temperature transition where @xmath41 spontaneously orders leading to an effective ` gauss s law ' for a @xmath5 gauge - matter theory , unlike a conventional gauge theory @xcite where the gauss s law is imposed explicitly on the hilbert space .",
    "contrast this also with 2d toric code @xcite where the gauss s law is imposed energetically by explicitly adding a term that is proportional to @xmath348 .",
    "since this term breaks the @xmath349 symmetry explicitly , there is no finite temperature transition in the 2d toric code .",
    "the fields @xmath41 in our model are of course classical in the sense that they are conserved and do nt have any dynamics",
    ". it would be desirable to extend the idea of studying deconfined phases of gauge theories without imposing the gauge constraint to other gauge groups as well , particularly to the case of @xmath350 gauge theory relevant to several spin - liquid candidates . imposing gauge constraint numerically is often challenging , and",
    "our results indicate that at least in certain gauge theories , is not necessarily required .    on the above note",
    ", it would also be interesting to explore toric code @xcite like hamiltonians with inbuilt @xmath349 symmetry , and study the implications of the melting of the gauss s law at finite temperature",
    ". this could be especially interesting in 4d toric code where there exist finite temperature quantum memory @xcite .",
    "is the quantum memory lost as soon as the thermal expectation value @xmath351 vanishes ?    in our models , the finite temperature transition corresponding to the ordering of @xmath41 coincided with spontaneous breaking of particle - hole symmetry for all values of @xmath0 .",
    "this is because @xmath352 .",
    "it is interesting to contemplate the possiblity of a phase where this is not the case such that @xmath41 order while the spatial correlation functions of @xmath302 are short - ranged .",
    "consider for example the model :      where @xmath354 .",
    "one can implement a @xmath355 symmetry in the above hamiltonian by demanding that @xmath356 be invariant under the transformation @xmath357 where @xmath358 where the prime on the first product denotes that it is taken over all vertical ( horizontol ) links either only for even rows ( columns ) or only for odd rows ( columns ) .",
    "this transformation takes @xmath355 , @xmath359 and @xmath360 . therefore , even though @xmath196 in this model , the order parameter for the charge - ordering , namely , @xmath361 will be non - zero only if the @xmath362 symmetry is spontaneously broken . a phase where @xmath41 order while @xmath33 remain disordered would necessarily involve interesting entanglement between the fermions and the ising degrees of freedom because one requires that @xmath363 while @xmath364 .",
    "the @xmath7 model has the richest phase diagram among the models we study .",
    "in particular , apart from the continuous transition between z@xmath145d and vbs , the phase diagram contains two distinct symmetry broken phases , the vbs and the sdw phase . remarkably , we find that these two phases are separated by a second order transition ( fig .",
    "[ stag_mag_su3.fig]b ) , which is thus expected to belong to a non - compact cp@xmath324 universality class @xcite . at this deconfined quantum critical point",
    ", we also study the imaginary - time dynamics via the calculation of structure factor @xmath365(fig .",
    "[ dyn_su3.fig ] , and found a rather broad continuum of excitations , consistent with the theoretical expectation that at this transition , the effective description is in terms of fractionalized ` spinons ' . to our knowledge",
    ", the dynamics at the deconfined quantum criticality has not been studied numerically in the past , and given rather distinct features seen in our work , it would be worthwhile to pursue this direction in quantum spin - models where much larger sizes are accessible via bosonic quantum monte carlo such as stochastic series expansion ( sse ) @xcite .",
    "some cautionary statements are in order for the @xmath7 case .",
    "we found it challenging to perform scaling collapse at the both quantum phase transitions , despite no indication of a first - order transition in the behavior of the order parameter .",
    "one reason for this could be that the two zero temperature transitions are rather close by in the phase diagram .",
    "this is visible in the behavior of the structure factor as @xmath27 is tuned ( fig .",
    "[ dyn_su3.fig ] ) where a diffuse continuum of excitations exists all the way from @xmath194 ( @xmath5 dirac phase ) to @xmath366 ( vbs to sdw transition ) .",
    "it s also worth mentioning that the system sizes we are working ( @xmath367 ) , are an order of magnitude smaller than the ones for spin - models which exhibit deconfined quantum criticality .",
    "we notice that when @xmath0 is even , our model does not suffer from sign problem even in the presence of the a non - zero chemical potential on arbitrary lattices",
    ". thus it would be interesting to extend our study to a system with finite density of fermions .",
    "we would like to conclude with a conjecture only tangentially related to the rest of the paper .",
    "consider the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ h_inf.eq ] for @xmath6 on an arbitrary graph , @xmath368 where @xmath369 and @xmath370 . assuming @xmath371 , the hamiltonian @xmath104 is sign problem free on an arbitrary graph because one can use hubbard - stratanovich decomposition to write the partition function as a sum of non - negative fermion determinants . on the other hand ,",
    "considering its decomposition into spin - hamiltonians @xmath372 and @xmath373 , only @xmath372 is sign problem free on an arbitrary graph due to all non - positive off - diagonal elements in a local basis . since @xmath374=0 $ ]",
    ", the simulatability of @xmath104 suggests that its ground state is likely identical to that of @xmath372 .",
    "that is , in the ground state one expects no singly occupied sites  half of the sites are unoccupied while the other half are doubly occupied , so that only @xmath372 acts non - trivially .",
    "this leads to the following conjecture : _ given a set of @xmath375 , the ground state energy of _",
    "@xmath376 _ is less than or equal to the ground state energy of _ @xmath377 .",
