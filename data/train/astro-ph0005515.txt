    "the search for the topology of the spatial sections of the universe has made tremendous progress in the past years ( see lachize  rey and luminet ( 1995 ) for an introduction to the subject and early references , luminet and roukema ( 1999 ) and uzan _ et al . _",
    "( 1999b ) for a review of the late developments ) .",
    "methods using two  dimensional data sets , such as the cosmic microwave background maps planned to be obtained by the map and planck surveyor satellite missions , and three  dimensional ( 3d ) data sets , such as galaxy , cluster and quasar surveys with redshifts , have been developped .",
    "following our previous works ( lehoucq _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , lehoucq _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 and uzan",
    "_ et al . _",
    "1999a ) , we focus on the topological information that can be extracted from a 3d catalogue of cosmic objects",
    ". the key point of all the topology  detecting methods is based on the  topological lens effect \" , i.e. on the fact that if the spatial section of the universe has at least one characteristic size smaller than the spatial scale of the catalogue , then one should observe different images of the same object . the original _ crystallographic method _ ( lehoucq _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) used a pair separation histogram ( _ psh _ ) depicting the number of pairs of catalogue s objects having the same three  dimensional separations in the universal covering space , with the idea that spikes should stand out dramatically at characteristic lengths related to the size of the fundamental domain and to the holonomies of space .",
    "however , following a remark by weeks ( 1998 ) , we proved ( uzan _ et al .",
    "_ 1999a and lehoucq _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) that sharp spikes can emerge in the _ psh _ only if the holonomies of space are clifford translations  a result independently derived by gomero _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) . as a consequence , the _ psh",
    "_ method does not apply to the detection of topology in universes with hyperbolic spatial sections .    since then , various generalisations of the crystallographic method were proposed .",
    "fagundes and gaussman ( 1998 ) suggested to map the differences between the _ psh _ of a simulated catalogue in a compact hyperbolic universe and the _ psh _ in the corresponding simply  connected universe having the same distribution of objects and cosmological parameters .",
    "they noticed sharp oscillations on the scale of the bin width , modulated by a broad oscillation on the scale of the curvature radius .",
    "however in uzan _",
    "( 1999b ) , we calculated on one hand the differential _ psh _ between a simulated distribution in a compact hyperbolic weeks space and a similar distribution in the simply  connected hyperbolic space @xmath0 , on the other hand the differential _",
    "psh _ between two different distributions ( with the same total number of objects ) in the simply  connected hyperbolic space @xmath0 . both curves ( fig .",
    "10 of uzan _ et al . _",
    "1999b ) exhibit the same pattern of sharp and broad oscillations , which shows that the topological significance of such a pattern is highly doubtful .",
    "fagundes and gaussman ( 1999 ) next proposed a modified crystallographic method in which the topological images in simulated catalogues are pulled back to the fundamental domain before the set of 3d distances is calculated .",
    "the distribution of pair distances is expected to be peaked around zero .",
    "the main drawback of this method is that the nature of the signal strongly depends on the topological type , on the orientation of the fundamental domain and on the position of the observer inside the latter .",
    "thus the pullback method can be useful only if the exact topology is already known .",
    "on the other hand , gomero _ et al . _",
    "( 1999 ) introduced a _",
    ", aimed to reduce the statistical noise that may mask the topological signature .",
    "they claimed that such a technique should detect the contribution of non - translational isometries to the topological signal , whatever the curvature of space , but the applicability of their method to real data has not been demonstrated .    in order to improve the signal  to  noise ratio inherent to _",
    "psh s _ , instead of reducing the statistical noise we can enhance the topological signal by collecting all distance correlations into a single index .",
    "such was our purpose in uzan _",
    "_ 1999a , where we reformulated cosmic crystallography as a collecting - correlated - pairs method ( _ ccp _ ) .",
    "the _ ccp _",
    "technique rests on the basic fact that in a multiply connected universe , equal distances appear more often than just by chance , whatever the curvature of space and the nature of holonomies .",
    "we also showed that the extraction of a topological signal drastically depends on the rather accurate knowledge of the cosmological parameters , namely the density parameter , @xmath1 , and the cosmological constant parameter , @xmath2 .",
    "this is due to the fact that all cosmic crystallography methods require the determination of 3d separations between two any images : observations use redshifts for determining the coordinate distance in the universal covering space ( in addition to the angular positions on the celestial sphere ) , and the redshift  distance relation involves the cosmological parameters .",
    "conversely , the detection of a topological signal would help to determine accurately the curvature parameters ( see also roukema and luminet 1999 ) .",
    "however it is to be recognized that , in the framework of cosmic crystallography , the application of numerical simulations to real data rest on two idealized assumptions , namely :    1 .",
    "all objects are strictly comoving 2 .",
    "the catalogues of observed objects ( quasars , galaxy clusters ) are complete .    although quoted in lachize ",
    "rey and luminet ( 1995 ) , the quantitative effects of such simplifications have not been fully discussed in the literature . in lehoucq _",
    "( 1996 ) , the authors qualitatively argued that the distortion due to peculiar velocities was negligible , and they performed numerical simulations to study the influence of the angular resolution of the surveys . in roukema ( 1996 ) , the influence of the astrophysical uncertainties ( mainly of spectroscopic measurements and of peculiar velocities ) on a method trying to find quintuplets of quasars with the same geometry ( and thus which may be topological images ) was evaluated .",
    "it was shown that , in such a case , the most serious uncertainty comes from the radial peculiar velocities . in uzan _",
    "( 1999a ) , we discussed the effect of the peculiar velocities and of the errors in the spatial position arising from the imprecisions on the values of the cosmological parameters .",
    "to finish , the errors on the determination of the position and of the peculiar velocities were discussed in roukema ( 1996 ) , and the way that the constraints on @xmath1 and @xmath2 depend on the redshifts of multiple topological images and on their radial and tangential separations was calculated in roukema and luminet ( 1999 ) .",
    "the goal of the present article is to have a critical attitude on the methods we have developped so far , by listing all the sources of observational uncertainties and by evaluating their effects on the theoretical efficiencies of the _ psh _ method ( lehoucq _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) and of the _ ccp _ method ( uzan _ et al . _",
    "1999a ) respectively . in   [ 2 ] , we discuss the nature of uncertainties and in   [ 3 ] the numerical methods used to estimate their effects on the topological signal .",
    "we then quantify the magnitude of each effect in the euclidean and hyperbolic cases (   [ 4 ] ) ( we postpone the case of elliptic spaces to a further study ) . in conclusion (   [ 5 ] ) we compare our results to the performances of current and future observational programs aimed to detect the topology of the universe .",

    "the local geometry of the universe is described by a friedmann  lematre metric @xmath3,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the scale factor , @xmath5 the cosmic time , @xmath6 the comoving radial distance , and @xmath7 according to the sign of the space curvature @xmath8 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath4 is obtained by solving the friedmann and the conservation equations @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are respectively the matter density and the pressure , @xmath13 is the cosmological constant and @xmath14 is the hubble parameter ( with a dot referring to a time derivative ) .",
    "we also use the standard parameters @xmath15 this completely specifies the properties and the dynamics of the universal covering space . in the following , we assume that we are in the matter dominated era , so that @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    the topology of the spatial sections is described by the fundamental domain , a polyhedron whose faces are pairwise identified by the elements @xmath18 of the holonomy group @xmath19 ( see lachize ",

    "early methods used to put a lower bound on the size of the universe and based on the direct recognition of multiple images of given objects  such as our galaxy ( sokolov and schvartsman 1974 ) , the coma cluster ( gott 1980 )  had to face a major drawback due to the fact that the same object would be seen at different lookback times .",
    "thus , evolution effects such as photometric or morphologic changes will , in most cases , render the identification of objects impossible ( see however roukema and edge , 1997 ) .",
    "statistical techniques such as the _ psh _ method ( lehoucq _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) and the _ ccp _ method ( uzan _ et al . _",
    "1999a ) are free from such biases .",
    "the two main sources of uncertainties for all the statistical methods trying to detect the topology of the universe in catalogues of cosmic objects are    1 .   the errors in the positions of observed objects , which can be separated into : 1 .",
    "the uncertainty in the determination of the redshifts due to spectroscopic imprecision ; such an effect is purely experimental and exists even if the objects are strictly comoving 2 .   the uncertainty in the position due to peculiar velocities of objects , which induce peculiar redshift corrections 3 .   the uncertainty in the cosmological parameters , which induces an error in the determination of the radial distance ( via the redshift  distance relation ) 4",
    "the angular displacement due to gravitational lensing by large scale structure .",
    "2 .   the incompleteness of the catalogue , which has two main origins : 1 .   selection effects implying that some objects are missing from the catalogue 2 .   the partial coverage of the celestial sphere , due either to the presence of the galactic plane , or to the fact that surveys are performed within solid angles much less than @xmath20 .    *",
    "effects of peculiar velocities *    a peculiar velocity has two effects on the determination of the position of a cosmic object :    1 .   an _ integrated _ effect , coming from the fact that if a galaxy has a proper velocity , then its true position differs from its comoving one .",
    "an _ instantaneous _ effect , due to the fact that the radial component of the proper velocity will add to the cosmological redshift an extra term , @xmath21 .    assuming that the vector velocity @xmath22 of a galaxy is constant , which is indeed a good enough approximation to estimate the effects of peculiar velocities , a galaxy at redshift @xmath23 has moved from its comoving position by a comoving distance @xmath24\\ ] ] where @xmath25 $ ] is the look ",

    "the redshift uncertainty @xmath42 can be related to the galaxy proper velocity as follows .",
    "if we consider the trajectory of a photon @xmath43 , @xmath44 being the affine parameter along the null geodesic , the relation between the emission ( e ) wavelength @xmath45 and the reception ( r ) wavelength @xmath46 can be expressed as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the tangent vector to the photon geodesic ; @xmath49 and @xmath50 are respectively the 4velocity of the observer and of the galaxy . neglecting the perturbations of the metric and of the matter and focusing on the doppler effect , one can easily show that @xmath51,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the direction in which the galaxy is observed and @xmath53 is its ( newtonian ) velocity . the observed ( spectroscopic ) redshift , @xmath54 , and the cosmological redshift , @xmath55 , respectively defined by @xmath56",
    "are thus related by @xmath57.\\ ] ] assuming that we can substract the earth s velocity , an error @xmath58 in the determination of @xmath54 can be interpreted in terms of a radial peculiar velocity given by @xmath59 as expected , a galaxy receding from us , i.e. with @xmath60 will have an additional redshift , whereas a galaxy drawing nearer to us will induce a doppler blueshift correction .",
    "+ the considerations above are also useful for discussing the effects of angular displacement @xmath61 due to gravitational lensing by large scale structure ( mellier 1999 , van waerbeke _",
    "et al . _ 2000 ) .",
    "a typical value @xmath62 arcsec corresponds to a peculiar velocity a few km.s@xmath63 as long as the redshift is less than 5 ( as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ plot_dtheta ] ) .",
    "thus effect @xmath64 is much less important than effect @xmath65 .",
    "* effects of catalogue incompleteness *    objects can be missing from a catalogue due to strong evolution effects ( this is particularly the case for quasars ) , and to absorption of light by intergalactic gas or dust in some sky directions .",
    "another well known selection effect is the malmquist bias : statistical samples of astronomical objects which are limited by apparent magnitude have mean absolute magnitudes which are different than those of distance  limited samples .",
    "an apparent magnitude  limited sample contains , if luminosity function has a finite width , some very luminous objects which , in spite of their large distances , can jump the apparent - magnitude limit of the catalogue .",
    "while one looks further and further out one finds more and more luminous objects .",
    "the consequence for an apparent  magnitude catalog ( which is the case with galaxy catalogues ) is that dwarf galaxies fade out quickly with distance , and finally at the largest distances the extremely luminous and rare galaxies are the only ones which can enter the catalogue .",
    "in addition to effects ( b1 ) and ( b2 ) , some noise spikes may appear due to gravitational clustering of objects .",
    "the large scale distribution of galaxies shows a variety of landscapes containing voids , walls , filaments and clusters in a complex 3d sponge - like pattern .",
    "for instance , since there are many galaxies in clusters , the distances associated to cluster - cluster separations may appear as fake spikes in the _ psh _ for galaxies . typical cluster ",
    "cluster separations are @xmath66 mpc ( guzzo _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) . such effects currently occur in n ",
    "body simulations that show clustering ( park and gott 1991 ) .",
    "the trouble can be relieved if galaxy clusters instead of galaxies are used as typical objects for probing the topology , although in that case supercluster - supercluster separations might also introduce noise spikes ( at a lower level ) .",
    "in the following , we perform numerical simulations to evaluate separately the magnitudes of the effects listed above . as usual , we start from a random distribution of cosmic objects in the fundamental domain . in a first step",
    "we generate a complete catalogue of comoving objects by unfolding the distribution in the universal covering space .",
    "we refer to this catalogue as the _ ideal catalogue _ since it would correspond to ideal observations . in a second step",
    "we introduce the various errors @xmath67 in order to build more realistic catalogues which depart from the ideal one .",
    "to study numerically the errors on the positions , we first assume that the cosmological parameters are known with good enough accuracy , so that we do not discuss ( a3 ) . then we perform the following calculations .    1 .   to evaluate the effect of the observational imprecision , we give to each object of the ideal catalogue ( built on the assumption that the objects are strictly comoving ) a redshift error to be added to its ideal redshift .",
    "we assume that the distribution of the redshift error is gaussian , with mean value @xmath68 and dispersion @xmath69 .",
    "+ note that , since @xmath69 is absolute , the relative error will be less important when we deal with catalogues of higher redshift objects .",
    "2 .   to discuss ( a2 ) , we associate a peculiar velocity to each point of the catalogue before unfolding . hence , there will be correlations between the velocities of two topological images .",
    "it follows that , assuming that the time evolution of the peculiar velocity is small , the observed velocities of two topological images of the same object can have different directions but similar magnitudes ( see e.g. roukema and bajtlik 1999 ) . as in the previous case , we assume that the velocity distribution is gaussian . moreover , velocities at different points of space are assumed to be uncorrelated both in magnitude and direction , which is indeed not strictly the case in real data since large scale streaming motions of galaxies have been observed ( strauss and willick 1995 ) .    more precisely , to generate the catalog of topological images taking into account the peculiar velocities , we proceed as follows :    1 .",
    "we generate a random collection of points @xmath70 ( named original sources ) uniformly distributed inside the fundamental domain .",
    "each point is assigned a velocity @xmath71 according to a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath72 and dispersion @xmath73 .",
    "we unfold this catalogue of original sources to obtain the set of points @xmath74 , images of @xmath70 by the holonomies @xmath75 .",
    "each image @xmath74 has a redshift @xmath76 corresponding to a look  back time @xmath77 calculated with formula ( [ tau_de_z ] ) .",
    "the final catalogue accounting for the peculiar velocities of the original sources is obtained by applying the @xmath78 to @xmath79 for all couples @xmath80 .    since @xmath69",
    "can be interpreted either as an uncertainty on the redshift determination or as due to a radial peculiar velocity , both errors ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) can be investigated with the same calculations .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath81 in terms of a radial peculiar velocity is useful to compare the orders of magnitude of ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) . in real data ,",
    "the error due to ( a2 ) is expected to be greater than the error due to ( a1 ) .",
    "starting from an ideal catalogue , we simulate two kinds of incomplete catalogues :    1 .   to account for effect ( b1 )",
    ", we randomly throw out @xmath82 of the objects from the ideal catalogue . in our various runs",
    "we vary @xmath83 while keeping approximately constant the number of catalogue objects , which means that we must increase the number of  original \" objects in the fundamental domain when @xmath83 is increasing .",
    "2 .   to simulate effect ( b2 ) , we generate a catalogue limited in solid angle by selecting only the objects that lie in a beam of aperture @xmath84 .",
    "the sky coverage is related to @xmath84 via @xmath85 again , we keep constant the number of objects in the catalogue when we vary @xmath84 .",
    "table [ coverage ] below gives typical numbers .",
    ".the multiplication factor , i.e. the ratio between the total number of entries in the catalogue and the number of  original \" objects randomly distributed in the fundamental domain , is given as a function of the solid angle of the survey .",
    "we have also indicated the corresponding sky coverage . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we now turn to universes with hyperbolic spatial sections and apply the _ ccp _ method as described in uzan _",
    "( 1999a ) .",
    "the obtention of a topological signal ( the so  called _ ccp _ index ) strongly depends on the correct determination of the cosmological parameters . in uzan _",
    "( 1999a ) we discussed the problems arising from the spanning of the cosmological parameters space with a required  accuracy bin \" @xmath86 .",
    "latest independent constraints on these cosmological parameters from the cosmic microwave background ( de bernardis _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) , the study of supernovae ( efstathiou _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) , of large scale structure at @xmath87 ( roukema and mamon , 2000 ) and of gravitational lensing ( mellier 1999 ) , make us hope that we can restrict further the parameters space to apply efficiently the _ ccp _ method . in the following , we assume that the cosmological parameters are known with the required accuracy .",
    "we choose the topology of the universe to be described by a weeks manifold ( weeks , 1985 ) ( see also lehoucq _ et al . _",
    "( 1999 ) for the numerical implementation of this topology ) , assuming the cosmological parameters given by @xmath88 and @xmath29 .",
    "in such a case the number of copies of the fundamental domain within the horizon is about 190 .",
    "however our simulated catalogues are much smaller than the horizon volume .",
    "we fix the number of objects to @xmath89 , which is a compromise between a realistic catalogue population and a reasonable computing time .",
    "again we perform the tests by varying the errors @xmath69 and @xmath73 around their average values @xmath68 and @xmath90 until when the _ ccp _ index falls down to noise level .",
    "contrarily to the euclidean case , both slight changes in redshift and in peculiar velocity induce errors in position which dramatically eradicate the topological signal : an error of only @xmath91 in velocity and an error in redshift of the order of the bin accuracy @xmath92 drown the _",
    "ccp _ index into noise .",
    "the incompleteness effects are less dramatic , as shown in figures [ plot_ppc ] and [ plot_skycov ] .",
    "again , for a given redshift cut ",
    "off , we performed the runs by varying @xmath83 and @xmath84 in order to find the critical values at which the topological signal disappears .",
    "our numerical results have now to be compared with the precisions of present experimental 3d data , and to the performances of observational programs started or expected to be achieved in the next decade .    at present day , a typical precision practical for the spectroscopic uncertainty is @xmath93 for an object such as a quasar . in clusters",
    ", spectroscopic redshifts can be found very precisely for individual galaxies .    concerning peculiar velocities , the typical dispersion velocity is @xmath94 in rich clusters .",
    "the x - ray velocity of the peak of the x - ray distribution would also provide a way to estimate the true cluster redshift , including the peculiar velocity of the cluster as a whole . for a quasar ,",
    "a conservative upper limit to the peculiar velocity , assuming the quasar to be at the centre of a galaxy , can be taken as @xmath95 .",
    "so , from an experimental point of view , the uncertainties on the redshifts will be dominated by effect ( a2 ) , namely the peculiar velocities , rather than by the spectroscopic imprecision .",
    "the main limitation of present 3d samples is the small volume of existing redshift data .",
    "future surveys will significantly improve both the redshift cut  off and the sky coverage .",
    "for instance , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ( loveday 1998 ) will map in detail one - quarter of the entire sky , determining the positions and absolute brightnesses of more than 100 million celestial objects .",
    "it will also measure distances to more than a million galaxies and quasars .",
    "more precisely , sdss will map a contiguous @xmath96 steradians area in the north galactic cap , up to a limiting magnitude 23 for two thirds of the observing time , together with three southern stripes centred at ra @xmath97 and with central declinations of @xmath98 and @xmath99 for the remaining one third of the time . concerning the distance determinations , @xmath100 galaxies and @xmath101 quasars",

    "precision on redshifts can be estimated for the reddest galaxies to @xmath107 .",
    "a sample of @xmath108 quasars will be observed , an order of magnitude larger than any existing quasar catalogue .",
    "the complete survey data will become public by 2005 .",

    "we have investigated how the various observational uncertainties will spoil the topological signal expected to arise in the ideal situation when crystallographic methods are applied to complete catalogues of perfectly comoving objets with zero proper velocities and whose 3d  positions are known with infinite accuracy . by numerical simulations",
    "we have introduced random errors for each possible uncertainty , and we varied the parameters to determine the limits at which the topological signal vanishes .    our numerical calculations of the spoiling effects due to the various uncertainties @xmath67 clearly show that the crystallographic methods are stable ( in the sense that the topological signal is robust when data depart from the ideal ones ) in the euclidean case , but highly unstable in the hyperbolic case . indeed in a small multi  connected flat space , realistic values of peculiar velocities of objects , errors in redshift determinations and partial sky coverage will not make the _ psh _ method to fail .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that the topological images of a given object are related together by clifford translations which enhance the topological signal . on the contrary , in a compact hyperbolic model , holonomies are not clifford translations .",
    "the topological signal , built as a _ ccp _",
    "index , is destroyed as soon as small errors are introduced in the position of objects , due either to peculiar velocities or to redshift measurement imprecision .",
    "the same kind of critical analysis should be made with the 2d topology  detecting methods based on the analysis of cmb data .",
    "for instance , in the pairs of matched circles method ( cornish _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , it would be necessary to investigate how deviations to the ideal situation , such as a non zero thickness of the last scattering surface or peculiar motions of the emitting primordial plasma regions , would alter the pattern of perfectly matched circles .    to conclude , let us comment on the future of observational cosmic topology , at the light of observational constraints on the curvature parameters recently provided by boomerang and maxima balloon measurements ( de bernardis _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 , hanany _ et al . _ 2000 ) . under specific assumptions such as a cold dark matter model and a primordial density fluctuation power spectrum ,",
    "the range of values allowed for the energy - density parameter @xmath110 is restricted to @xmath111 with @xmath112 confidence .",
    "this means that the curvature radius of space is as least as great as the radius of the observable universe ( delimited by the last scattering surface ) .",
    "such results , if accepted , leave open all three cases of space curvature as well as most of multi  connected topologies .",
    "a strictly flat space is quite improbable .",
    "even inflationary scenarios predict a value of @xmath113 asymptocally close to 1 , but not strictly equal . from a topological point of view",
    ", a strictly euclidean space would be interesting since we have shown that the _ psh _ method is robust enough to provide a topological signal even when realistic uncertainties on the data are taken into account .    for compact hyperbolic spaces , if we accept the recent observational constraints @xmath114 , a number of spaceforms such as the weeks or the thurston manifolds still have topological lengths smaller than the horizon size ( weeks : snappea ) .",
    "however the topological lens effects would be weaker in spaceforms with @xmath113 close to 1 than in spaceforms with @xmath115 ( see figs . 2 and 3 of lehoucq _ et al .",

    ", only the _ ccp _ method can be applied for detecting the topology , and the present article shows that the topological signal will fall to noise level as soon as uncertainties smaller than the experimental ones are taken into account in the simulations .    eventually , elliptical spaceforms appear to be the most interesting case . on a theoretical point of view , as far as we know , no inflationary model is able to drive the density parameter to a value greater than 1 , so that if space happened to be really elliptical , new models should be built in order to explain , e.g. , the primordial fluctuations spectrum or the horizon problem . from a topological point of view , since the volumes of ( all closed ) spaceforms are not bounded below ( the order of the holonomy group can be arbitrarily large ) , one can always find an elliptical space which fits into the hubble radius even if @xmath116 .",
    "on the other hand , the holonomies of such spaces are clifford translations , so that we can hope to apply the robust _ psh _ method to detect a topological signal .",
    "this will be the purpose of our subsequent paper ."
