    "cellular automata ( ca ) are particular forms of finite state machines that can be investigated by the usual analytic techniques ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "ca have been used in application areas so different as physical system simulation , biological process , species evolution , socio - economical models or test pattern generation .",
    "they are defined as arrays of identical cells in an _ n_-dimensional space and characterized by different parameters @xcite : the cellular geometry , the neighborhood specification , the number of contents per cell and the transition rule to compute the successor state .",
    "their simple , modular and cascable structure makes them very attractive for vlsi implementations .    on the other hand , linear feedback shift registers ( lfsrs )",
    "@xcite are linear structures currently used in the generation of pseudorandom sequences . the inherent simplicity of lfsrs , their ease of implementation and the good statistical properties of their output sequences turn them into natural building blocks for the design of pseudorandom sequence generators with applications in spread - spectrum communications , circuit testing , error - correcting codes , numerical simulations or cryptography .",
    "in recent years , one - dimensional ca have been proposed as an alternative to lfsrs ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) in the sense that every sequence generated by a lfsr can be obtained from one - dimensional ca too . in cryptographic applications ,",
    "pseudorandom sequence generators currently involve several lfsrs combined by means of nonlinear functions or irregular clocking techniques ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover in @xcite , it is proved that one - dimensional linear ca are isomorphic to conventional lfsrs .",
    "thus , the latter structures can be simply substituted by the former ones in order to accomplish the same goal : generation of keystream sequences .",
    "the above class of linear ca has been found to satisfy randomness properties with application in the testing of digital circuits , built - in self - test ( bist ) schemes and self - checking @xcite .",
    "the current interest of these ca stems from the lack of correlation between the bit sequences generated by adjacent cells , see @xcite . in this sense , linear ca are superior to the more common lfsrs @xcite that have been traditionally used as pseudorandom pattern generators .",
    "nevertheless , the main advantage of ca is that multiple generators designed as nonlinear structures in terms of lfsrs preserve the linearity when they are expressed under the form of ca .",
    "this paper considers the problem of finding one - dimensional ca that reproduce the output sequence of a particular lfsr - based generator .",
    "more precisely , in this work a wide class of lfsr - based nonlinear generators , the so - called clock - controlled shrinking generators ( ccsgs ) @xcite , can be described in terms of one - dimensional ca configurations .",
    "indeed , the well known shrinking generator @xcite is just an element of such a class .",
    "the automata here presented unify in a simple structure the above mentioned class of sequence generators . the algorithm that converts a given ccsg into a ca - based linear model is very simple and can be applied to ccsgs in a range of practical interest .",
    "the underlying idea of this modelling procedure is the concatenation of a basic automaton .",
    "once the generators have been linearized , a cryptanalytic approach to reconstruct the generated sequence is also presented .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , the basic structures considered , e.g. one - dimensional ca and ccsgs , are introduced .",
    "a simple algorithm to determine the pair of ca corresponding to a particular shrinking generator and its generalization to clock - controlled shrinking generators are given in sections 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "a method of reconstructing the generated sequence that exploits the linearity of the ca - based model is presented in section 5 . finally , conclusions in section 6 end the paper .",
    "in the following subsections , we introduce the general characteristics of the basic structures we are dealing with : one - dimensional cellular automata , the shrinking generator and the class of clock - controlled shrinking generators .",
    "the work is restricted to ca and lfsrs with binary contents .",
    "in addition , all the lfsrs here considered are maximal - length lfsrs , that is their output sequences are _ _ pn-__sequences and their characteristic polynomials are primitive polynomials , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one - dimensional cellular automata can be described as _",
    "l_-cell registers @xcite , whose cell contents are updated at the same time instant according to a particular _ k_-variable function ( the _ transition rule _ ) denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "if the function @xmath0 is a linear function , so is the cellular automaton .",
    "in addition , for cellular automata with binary contents there can be up to @xmath1 different mappings to the next state .",
    "moreover , if @xmath2 , then the binary content of the _ i - th _ cell at time @xmath3 depends on the contents of @xmath4 neighbor cells at time @xmath5 in the following way : @xmath6    the number of cells @xmath7 ( numbered from left to right ) is the length of the automaton .",
    "ca are called _ uniform _ whether all cells evolve under the same rule while ca are called _ hybrid _ whether different cells evolve under different rules . at the ends of the array , two different boundary conditions are possible : _ null automata _ when cells with permanent null contents are supposed adjacent to the extreme cells or _ periodic automata _ when extreme cells are supposed adjacent .    in this paper , only transition rules with @xmath8 will be considered .",
    "thus , there are @xmath9 of such rules among which just two ( rule @xmath10 and rule @xmath11 ) lead to non trivial machines .",
    "such rules are described as follows :    rule 90 + @xmath12 +    @xmath13    rule 150 + @xmath14 +    @xmath15    remark that the names rule 90 and rule 150 derive from the decimal values of their next - state functions : @xmath16 ( binary ) = @xmath10 ( decimal ) and @xmath17 ( binary ) = @xmath11 ( decimal ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath18 the content of the _ i - th _ cell at time @xmath3 depends on the contents of either two different cells ( rule 90 ) or three different cells ( rule 150 ) at time @xmath5 .",
    "the symbol @xmath19 denotes addition modulo @xmath20 among cell contents .",
    "remark that both transition rules are linear .",
    "this work deals exclusively with one - dimensional linear null hybrid ca with rules 90 and 150 . a natural way of specifying such ca is an _ _",
    "l-__tuple @xmath21 $ ] , called _ rule vector _ , where @xmath22 if the _",

    "a sub - automaton of the previous automata class consisting of cells 1 through @xmath24 will be denoted by @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26    for a cellular automaton of length @xmath27 cells , configuration rules @xmath28 and initial state @xmath29 , table [ table:1 ] illustrates the formation of its output sequences ( binary sequences read vertically ) and the succession of states ( binary configurations of 10 bits read horizontally ) . for the above mentioned rules",
    ", the different states of the automaton are grouped in closed cycles .",
    "the number of different output sequences for a particular cycle is @xmath30 as the same sequence ( although shifted ) may appear simultaneously in different cells . at the same time",
    ", all the sequences in a cycle will have the same period and linear complexity @xcite .",
    "moreover , any of the output sequence of the automaton can be produced at any cell provided that the right state cycle is chosen .",
    "on the other hand , linear finite state machines are currently represented and analyzed by means of their transition matrices .",
    "the form and characteristics of these matrices for the ca under consideration can be found in @xcite .",
    "in fact , such matrices are tri - diagonal matrices with the rule vector on the main diagonal , 1 s on the diagonals below and above the main one and all other entries being zero .",
    "every automaton is completely specified by its characteristic polynomial , that is the characteristic polynomial of its transition matrix .",
    "such a characteristic polynomial can be computed in terms of the characteristic polynomials of the previous sub - automata according to the recurrence relation @xcite : @xmath31 being @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "next , the following definition is introduced :    [ definition:1 ] a multiplicative - polynomial cellular automaton is defined as a cellular automaton whose characteristic polynomial is a reducible polynomial of the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a positive integer . if @xmath36 is a primitive polynomial , then the automaton is called a primitive multiplicative - polynomial cellular automaton .",
    "the class of binary sequence generators we are dealing with is described in the following subsections .",
    "the shrinking generator is a binary sequence generator @xcite composed by two lfsrs : a control register @xmath37 that decimates the sequence produced by the other register @xmath38 .",
    "we denote by @xmath39 their corresponding lengths with @xmath40 as well as @xmath41 .",

    "if @xmath48 2 .   if @xmath49 is discarded .",
    "a simple example illustrates the behavior of this structure .",
    "let us consider the following lfsrs :    1 .",

    "the period of the shrunken sequence is @xmath65 and its linear complexity @xcite , notated @xmath66 , satisfies the following inequality @xmath67 a simple calculation , based on the fact that every state of @xmath38 coincides once with every state of @xmath37 , allows one to compute the number of @xmath68 s in the shrunken sequence .",
    "such a number is constant and equal to @xmath69 comparing period and number of @xmath70 , it can be concluded that the shrunken sequence is a quasi - balanced sequence .",
