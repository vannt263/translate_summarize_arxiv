    "faraday rotation measures ( rm ) is one of the very few methods to probe extragalactic magnetic fields .",
    "the rm is given by the change in observed polarization angle , @xmath0 , over a change in the observed wavelength square , @xmath1 .",
    "for a polarized radio source at cosmological redshift @xmath2 it is defined as    @xmath3    where the rm is in units of rad m@xmath4 , the free electron number density , @xmath5 , is in @xmath6 , the magnetic field component along the line of sight , @xmath7 , is in gauss , and the comoving path increment per unit redshift , @xmath8/@xmath9 , is in pc .",
    "[ eq : defrm ] assumes a uniform rm screen across the source and a spatial separation of the linearly polarized source and the faraday rotating plasma .",
    "in @xcite ( k08 ) we used a sample of 268 rm values of extragalactic radio sources to assess the redshift evolution in the rm dispersion .",
    "we found an increase in the rm dispersion with redshift , which became statistically significant above @xmath10 .",
    "we postulated that the increase in the rm dispersion is produced by magnetic fields in intervening galaxies . to test this hypothesis spectra of 71 qsos at uves",
    "/ vlt were taken . in @xcite ( b08 )",
    "we showed that indeed sightlines with intervening strong mgii absorption systems have significantly higher rm values than those without .",
    "the findings in that work implies that @xmath11 magnetic fields exist in galaxies out to @xmath12 .",
    "recently @xcite ( tss09 ) determined rm values of 37543 sources , based on polarization observation of the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) .",
    "after the release of the rm catalogue we compared our rm values with those of tss09 and found major differences between the two datasets . as we show in section [ discrepancies ] using the rm values of tss09 the results of k08 and b08 can not be reproduced . in this work we present an analysis of the differences found between the two datasets .",
    "we then develop a toy model to show that such differences can be accounted for by inhomogeneities in the rm screens of the qsos host galaxies and intervening galaxies . in view of this model , due to the strong depolarization effects , rm data based on low frequencies observations and interpreted according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : defrm ] ) are inadequate to probe inhomogeneous rm screens produced by intervening galaxies .",
    "recently there has been an increased attention to the effects of inhomogeneous rm screens on the observed degree of polarization and polarization angle as function of wavelength .",
    "@xcite used multiwavelength radio observations to model depolarization of their sources .",
    "they showed that the depolarization as a function of wavelength can be better described including a covering factor for the inhomogeneous screens .",
    "@xcite used westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) observation at @xmath13 combined with nvss observation at 21 cm to test different depolarization models and rm determination methods .",
    "they considered the traditional faraday dispersion screen @xcite , a two component model for faraday rotation which produces oscillation in the degree of polarization , and the rm synthesis method .",
    "the comparison of the different rm values obtained from these methods revealed that if faraday structure is present , the different methods may lead to different rms .",
    "they further stress the importance of considering both the polarization angle and amplitude for the correct determination of the rms .",
    "while several effects may be at work , as briefly discussed in section [ effects : sec ] , in this paper we keep the level of sophistication of the model to a minimum and focus on the role of faraday screen particularly on simple ideas associated with inhomogeneity which can account for important observational effects and test these ideas for consistency with available data .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ rm_data ]",
    "the rm datasets of b08 and k08 are compared and the differences are presented .",
    "previous work on depolarization of extragalactic sources is shortly presented in section [ sec : depmodel ] . in section [ modelling ] a depolarization toy model is presented which can account for the differences in the rm values of the two datasets .",
    "a discussion of the nature of the partial inhomogeneous rm screens and computed faraday spectra as comparison for rm surveys is presented in section [ sec : discussion ] . in section",
    "[ sec : summary ] we give a summary of our findings .",
    "the rm values used in k08 , b08 and @xcite were collected by p. kronberg and collaborators over the past decades using polarization observations at various telescopes , including vla and effelsberg .",
    "the sample consists of 901 sources with determined rm and redshifts , partly taken by kronberg and collaborators , partly taken from the literature @xcite . until the work of tss09 it has been the only existing large rm catalogue .",
    "generally at least three wavelengths were used for the rm determination ( phil kronberg , private communication ) using polarization data between 37 to 0.9 ghz , with the bulk of the data between @xmath14 10.5 to 1.6 ghz @xcite .    in the following sections we will assume that the determinations of the rm values of k08 were typically done at 6 cm and designate the rm values as @xmath15 . of course due to the heterogeneity of the sample the wavelength range and typical value over which the rms are determined might vary . while this is undesirable",
    ", its main effect should be the introduction of noise in the relations predicted by our model between measured quantities",
    ". there might be additional issues associated with the heterogenous character of the polarization data used for the rm determinations , which , however , are not addressed here .",
    "the sample of k08 consists of 268 sources at galactic latitudes @xmath16 ( exact definition given in k08 ) . in b08",
    "we obtained high resolution spectra of 71 relatively bright qsos and relaxed the selection to @xmath17 .",
    "here we use the subset that was employed in the study of b08 and @xcite ( the rm data are still proprietary and will be published elsewhere by p. kronberg ) , except when we look for differences in the redshift evolution and use all sources at @xmath17 which were also in the @xcite catalogue .",
    "the rm values of tss09 are based on the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) from @xcite which covers the sky at declinations @xmath18 in stokes i , q and u. the survey imaged the sky at 21 cm with a resolution of @xmath19 arcsecs and produced a catalogue of @xmath20 discrete sources .",
    "tss09 choose a subsample of this catalogue and derived rm values of these sources based on determination of the polarization angles at 1364.9 mhz and 1435.1 mhz .",
    "the subsample was selected by requesting a source intensity @xmath21 and a 8@xmath22 detection in polarized intensity . to ensure that the polarized intensity is not dominated by instrumental effects they only considered sources with a fractional polarization greater than 0.5 @xmath23 , which yielded a rm catalogue of 37543 objects . in the following sections we will designate the rm values of tss09 as @xmath24 .",
    "after the release of the tss09 s rm catalogue we checked if it contained any of the sources in b08 , and found this to be the case for 54 out of 71 of them .",
    "somewhat surprisingly we found striking differences in the rm values which are briefly presented here :    \\i ) a comparison of the rm values from k08 and tss09 reveals that the biggest differences in the rm datasets correspond to large rm values of k08 and sources having a low degree of polarization @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath25 is the degree of polarization at   21 cm from tss09 ( average degree of polarization at the two wavelengths 20.89 cm @xmath26 21.96 cm ) .",
    "the situation is illustrated in figure [ fig : compppk_t ] .",
    "sources with @xmath27 ( black cross , 25 qsos ) have quite similar rm values in both datasets and mostly crowd around the diagonal line . on",
    "the other hand sources with @xmath28 show a big scatter around the diagonal line .",
    "furthermore there are sources which have large rm values ( @xmath29 rad m@xmath4 ) in the dataset of k08 but very low @xmath30 values in the sample of tss09 .",
    "the value of @xmath31 maximizes these effects in figure [ fig : compppk_t ] .",
    "\\ii ) using a sample of 371 rm values from tss09 at latitudes @xmath17 and for which the qso s redshifts , @xmath32 , were available , we found no increase in the rm dispersion with @xmath32 , contrary to the main finding of k08 .",
    "the situation is illustrated in figure [ fig : cumrmz ] , where the cumulative rm distributions at 6 cm ( left panel ) and 21 cm ( right panel ) are shown , split at the median fractional polarization of the total sample , @xmath33 ( blue and black lines ) , and according to whether the source redshift is below or above @xmath34 ( solid and dash line , respectively ) .",
    "the cumulative distribution of @xmath35 shows no evolution with @xmath32 in both low and high @xmath25 samples , whereas there is a significant broadening of the low @xmath25 ( @xmath36 ) @xmath37 distribution with @xmath32 .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test ( ks test ) reveals that the rm distributions above and below @xmath34 are different at a significance level of 99.75%",
    ". we also show ( red distributions ) sources with determined @xmath15 values which are not in the @xcite catalogue , but have declination @xmath38 and are thus in the nvss .",
    "most likely these sources are below the inclusion limits of the @xcite catalogue , which are a @xmath39 detection in polarized intensity and @xmath40 .",
    "a redshift evolution can be seen also for these sources with a similar significance level of 99.64% .",
    "most likely the broadening of the rm distribution towards lower polarization @xmath25 is due to galactic depolarization and possibly partly due to an increased error in rm , @xmath41 , towards lower polarized flux levels .",
    "this is supported by the fact that @xmath42 , where p is the polarized flux and @xmath43 its error @xcite , and the high correlation between @xmath25 and polarized flux , as attested by a kendall s @xmath44 test , which yields @xmath45 and a chance probability of only @xmath46 using all 371 rm values .",
    "however the broadening with z seen in the @xmath37 distributions is hard to explain by an observational bias .",
    "the interpretation of a @xmath25 dependent redshift evolution of the @xmath47 distribution is however not straightforward either . in section [ modelling ]",
    "we show that it is crucial to distinguish between sight lines with / without intervening galaxies .",
    "\\iii ) the result of b08 that the rm distribution for qsos with strong mgii systems along their sight lines is broader ( at @xmath48 significance level ) than for qsos free of absorbers , completely disappears using the rm values of tss09 .",
    "figure [ fig : cumrmdist ] shows the cumulative distribution ( dash histograms ) of @xmath35 values from tss09 for sight lines with ( @xmath49 , black ) ) and without mgii ( @xmath50 , red ) absorption systems .",
    "clearly there is no difference between the two rm distributions . for comparison",
    "the solid histograms show the distributions of the @xmath37 values of b08 .      in the following sections we present a simple model to describe the impact of inhomogeneous , redshift dependent faraday screens , on the polarization and rm of distant qsos , as a function of wavelength",
    ".    however , additional effects may be at work when comparing quantities measured at different frequencies .",
    "in particular besides potential large uncertainties measured with both datasets , the low and high frequency emissions may originate from separate components in the source ( e.g. the radio lobes and the compact core in a radio galaxy ) , inducing all sorts of frequency dependent effects , e.g. , location , angular size , spectral indices and fractional polarization .",
    "for example , in some radio sources the fractional polarization appear to increase and then decrease with wavelength  @xcite .    also , while our model could be validated ( or ruled out ) by comparison of its predictions with observational data , this would require a high quality dataset , where the effects discussed above ( and possibly others ) are kept under strict control .",
    "unfortunately such a dataset is not available to us at the moment , which forces us to refrain from such comparison .",
    "the latter , however , might be possible in the near future , with the delivery of new radio data from polarization surveys , either planned or just under way ( see sec .",
    "[ rms : sec ] ) .     and",
    "@xmath24 respectively , splitted according to whether the degree of polarization is above ( black crosses ) or below ( red filled circles ) @xmath51 .",
    "the two datasets differ especially for low @xmath25 values .",

    "in this section we develop a simple model to understand the effects arising from inhomogeneous faraday screens and show that these can produce important depolarization effects that reproduce the differences of the rm datasets of k08 and tss09 .",
    "the observed polarization @xmath53 can be written as a complex number as : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the fractional degree of polarization given by the ratio of the polarized and total intensity , p and i , respectively and @xmath56 is the polarization angle determined by the other stokes parameters , u and q , as @xmath57 .    the linear dependence between the polarization angle , @xmath56 and @xmath58 stated in eq .",
    "[ eq : defrm ] is only valid for the case of a uniform foreground screen . both the presence of unresolved inhomogeneities in the faraday screen and/or sources of polarized radiation embedded within the faraday active region produce increasing depolarization of the source at longer wavelength @xcite",
    "this leads to nonlinear dependencies of the polarization angles and @xmath58 . in such cases detailed",
    "modeling is necessary for the correct interpretation of the rms and for their use in measurements of magnetic fields .",
    "there are several mechanisms that can reduce the fractional degree of polarization either in the radio source itself or in its foreground :    * @xcite showed that random fluctuations in the magnetic field within the source lead to a wavelength independent reduction of the degree of polarization .",
    "the latter is given by the ratio of the regular - to - total magnetic field energy , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the theoretical value of the degree of polarization which depends on the spectral index @xmath61 of the emitting relativistic electrons ( @xmath62 for @xmath63 ) , and @xmath64 is the degree of polarization as @xmath65 . * a further effect which reduces the degree of polarization is _ differential faraday rotation _",
    "this effect happens if the synchrotron emission and the medium producing the faraday rotation are not spatially separated .",
    "in such a case polarization angles from different depths within the source are rotated differently .",
    "the line of sight integrated emission suffers increasing depolarization with increasing wavelength . for extragalactic sources",
    "this effect seems not to be important @xcite . * inhomogeneous faraday rotation screens within the radio beam lead to depolarization of the sources .",
    "if the rm screen is modelled by many independent rm cells , this effect is called depolarization by _ external faraday dispersion _ @xcite . if the rm screen varies systematically within the radio beam this effect",
    "is called _ beam depolarization_.",
    "@xcite gives the formula @xmath66 to describe the depolarization induced by an inhomogeneous faraday screen with a rm dispersion @xmath67 .",
    "assuming for simplicity that each rm cell is a cube of linear size @xmath68 , then each cell contributes a dispersion @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the number of cells along the path - length l traversed by the radio waves .",
    "the size of the cell is determined by the scale above which the rm contributions are uncorrelated and can be determined by computing the structure function in high resolution rm maps . and",

    "@xcite and @xcite modelled polarisation observations of @xmath73 compact steep spectrum sources between 2.8 to 21 cm done with the wsrt , vla and effelsberg telescope .",
    "they observed that the fractional degree of polarisation at large wavelengths is too large to be explained by burn s depolarization law ( eq.[eq : burndep ] ) .",
    "they observed that for a large fraction of sources p remains approximately constant above 6 - 13 cm . to account for these observation they suggested that just a fraction of the polarised source is covered by a depolarising inhomogeneous rm screen and modified eq .",

    "below , we explicitly compute the depolarization by typical rm screens as a function of redshift of the sources .",
    "in our model the faraday screens consist of three components : ( i ) an inhomogeneous foreground screen local to the source with covering factor @xmath80 , ( ii ) an inhomogeneous foreground screen in intervening galaxies with covering factors @xmath81 and ( iii ) a homogeneous screen due to the milky way , which is assumed uniform across the extension on the sky of the polarized source .",
    "the uniform faraday screen in the milky way is set to a constant value , @xmath82 .",
    "this value is consistent with @xcite who determined the milky way contribution of rotation measures at @xmath83 using the @xcite data .    on the other hand ,",
    "each inhomogeneous foreground faraday screen is characterized by an ensemble of cells of size @xmath68 with uncorrelated rm values .",
    "the rm values have a gaussian distribution with dispersion @xmath84 and zero mean , where @xmath85 is the rest - frame rm dispersion , @xmath86 the screen s redshift and , @xmath87 labels different screens types , for which the above parameters may differ .",

    "if the rm screen is at the redshift of the mgii systems , @xmath88 is the projected linear size of the source viewed from the earth at the distance to the mgii system .",
    "each screen is then fully described by a realization of @xmath91 rm values , a fraction @xmath90 of which are extracted from the associated gaussian distribution to characterize the active cells , while the reminder are set to zero to represent the inactive cells . assuming a uniform flux of normalized intensity ( i=1 ) and uniform ( zero ) intrinsic polarization angle across the source surface , we can write the following relations for the remaining non - zero stokes parameter u , q , the angle and degree of polarization , respectively , @xmath92 where @xmath93 are random variables determined by a monte - carlo realization .    in figure [ fig : sketch_dep ] we present generic results for three representative cases , namely a low ( @xmath94 ) and high ( @xmath95 ) redshift qso with no intervening absorber in the top and mid panel , respectively , and a high redshift qso with intervening absorber in the bottom panel .",
