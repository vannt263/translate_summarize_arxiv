    "plus2pt minus1pt    the simulation of frequency domain electromagnetic wave scattering gives rise to a host of computational challenges that mostly result from oscillatory solutions , and ill - conditioning in the low and high - frequency regimes .",
    "computational modeling of electromagnetic scattering has been attempted based on the classical finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) methods .",
    "however , algorithms based on the finite - difference or finite - element discretizations require discretization of unoccupied volumetric regions and give rise to numerical dispersion which is inevitably associated with numerical propagation of waves across large numbers of volumetric elements  @xcite .",
    "an important computational alternative to finite - difference and finite - element approaches is found in boundary integral methods .",
    "numerical methods based on integral formulations of scattering problems enjoy a number of attractive properties as they formulate the problems on lower - dimensional , bounded computational domains and capture intrinsically the outgoing character of scattered waves . thus , on account of the dimensional reduction and associated small discretizations ( significantly smaller than the discretizations required by volumetric finite - element or finite - difference approximations ) , in conjunction with available _ fast _ solvers  @xcite , numerical algorithms based on integral formulations , when applicable , can outperform their finite - element / difference counterparts . on account of this , and whenever possible , the simulation of high - frequency scattering problems relies almost exclusively on boundary integral equations based solvers .",
    "there has been significant recent progress on extending the range of high - frequency solvers that can be solved by boundary integral equation solvers , mostly in the case of scalar problems with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "this was made possible by hybrid methods that incorporate the known oscillatory behavior of solutions of boundary integral equations at high frequencies in order to reduce drastically the number of unknowns  see the excellent review paper  @xcite for a full account of these methods .    while well - conditioned integral formulations for scalar problems with dirichlet boundary conditions have been known and used for quite some time , that is not the case for electromagnetic problems .",
    "the scope of this paper is to address the question : what integral equations should one use for the efficient simulation of high - frequency frequency - domain electromagnetic scattering problems .",
    "the most widely used integral equation formulations for solution of frequency domain scattering problems from perfectly electric conducting ( pec ) closed three - dimensional objects are the combined field integral equations ( cfie ) formulations  @xcite .",
    "the cfie are uniquely solvable throughout the frequency spectrum , yet the spectral properties of the boundary integral operators associated with the cfie formulations are not particularly suited for krylov - subspace iterative solvers such as gmres  @xcite .",
    "this is attributed to the fact that the electric field ( efie ) operator , which is a portion of the cfie , is a pseudodifferential operator of order @xmath1  @xcite  that is , asymptotically , the action of the operator in fourier space amounts to multiplication by the fourier - transform variable .",
    "consistent with this fact , the eigenvalues of these operators accumulate at infinity , which causes the condition numbers of cfie formulations to grow with the discretization size , a property that is shared by integral equations of the first kind .",
    "the lack of well conditioning of the operators in cfie is exacerbated at high frequencies , a regime where cfie require efficient preconditioners that should ideally control the amount of numerical work entailed by iterative solvers . in this",
    "regard , one possibility is to use algebraic preconditioners , typically based on multi - grid methods @xcite , or frobenius norm minimizations and sparsification techniques @xcite .",
    "however , the generic algebraic preconditioning strategies are not particularly geared towards wave scattering problems , and , in addition , they may encounter convergence breakdowns at higher frequencies that require large discretizations @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "several alternative integral equation formulations for pec scattering problems that possess good conditioning properties have been introduced in the literature in the past fifteen years  @xcite .",
    "some of these formulations were devised to avoid the well - known``low - frequency breakdown ''  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the current and charge integral equation formulation  @xcite , although not fredholm of the second kind , does not suffer from the low - frequency breakdown and has reasonable properties throughout the frequency range  @xcite .",
    "another class of fredholm boundary integral equations of the second kind for the solution of pec electromagnetic scattering problems can be derived using generalized debye sources  @xcite .",
    "although these formulations targeted the low frequency case , their versions that use single layers with imaginary wavenumbers possess good condition numbers for higher frequencies for spherical scatterers  @xcite .",
    "another wide class of formulations that is directly related to the present work can be viewed as regularized integral equations as they typically involve using pseudoinverses / regularizers of the electric field integral operators to mollify the undesirable derivative - like effects of the latter operators . in the cases",
    "when the scattered electric fields are sought as linear combinations of magnetic and electric dipole distributions , the former acting on tangential densities while the latter acting on certain regularizing operators of the same tangential densities , the enforcement of the pec boundary conditions leads to regularized combined field integral equations ( cfier ) or generalized combined sources integral equations ( gcsie ) . in the case of smooth scatterers ,",
    "the various regularizing operators proposed in the literature one the one hand ( a ) stabilize the leading order effect of the pseudodifferential operators of order @xmath1 that enter cfie , so that the integral operators in cfier are compact perturbations of invertible diagonal matrix operators and ( b ) have certain coercivity properties that ensure the invertibility of the cfier operators .",
    "one way to construct regularizing operators that achieve the objective ( a ) can be pursued in the framework of approximations of admittance / dirichlet - to - neumann operators ( that is the operators that map the values of the vector product between the unit normal and the electric field on the surface of the scatterer to the value of the vector product between the unit normal and the magnetic field on the surface of the scatterer  see section  [ dtn ] )  @xcite which can be connected to on - surface radiation conditions ( osrc )  @xcite .",
    "another way to construct such operators is to start from caldern s identities  @xcite that establish that the square of the electric field integral operator is a compact perturbation of the identity .",
    "all of these regularizing operators are either electric field integral operators , its vector single layer components , or their principal symbols in the sense of pseudodifferential operators .",
    "the regularizing operators that have property ( a ) can be modified to meet the requirement ( b ) either via quadratic partitions of unity  @xcite or by means of _ complexification _ of the wavenumber in the definition of electric field integral operators or its components  @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "only the regularized formulations in  @xcite are shown rigorously to be fredholm integral equations of the second kind and invertible in the appropriate trace spaces of electromagnetic scattering of smooth scatterers . in the case of lipschitz scatterers , the situation is more complicated .",
    "the well posedness of the classical cfie formulations has not yet been proved for lipschitz boundaries .",
    "the main difficulty stems from the lack of compactness of the magnetic field integral operators ( sometimes referred to as electromagnetic double layer operators ) in the case of lipschitz boundaries .",
    "alternative boundary integral equations  @xcite use regularizers that act precisely on the magnetic field integral operators and lead to formulations whose operators are compact perturbations of coercive operators .",
    "the latter property ensures the well posedness of the aforementioned regularized boundary integral equations in lipschitz domains .    the main contribution of this paper is the design , analysis , and fast , high - order implementation of a novel cfier formulation which we refer to as caldern - complex cfier",
    "this formulation uses regularizing operators that are multiples of efie operators with _ complex _ wavenumbers with positive real and imaginary parts .",
    "we show that for smooth scatterers and under certain assumptions on the magnitude of the real and imaginary parts of the wavenumbers in the definition of the regularizing operators , the caldern - complex cfier operators are fredholm of index zero in appropriate functional spaces and that these operators are injective .",
    "while the fredholm property of these novel operators can be established based on previous results in  @xcite , the proof of their injectivity requires a more involved analysis .",
    "we also show that in case of spherical scatterers , the complex wavenumbers in the definition of the regularizing operators can be selected so that to lead to caldern - complex cfier formulations that are coercive and have condition numbers that can be bounded independently of the frequency for high - frequencies .",
    "this selection appropriately extended to scatterers with slowly varying curvatures leads to formulations with similar properties .",
    "in addition to the caldern - complex cfier we extend the analysis developed in  @xcite to prove for the first time in the literature the well posedness of cfier formulations whose regularizing operators are efie operators with _ purely imaginary _ wavenumbers .",
    "in order to be consistent with notations in the literature  @xcite , we refer to the latter operators as caldern - ikawa cfier .",
    "these operators were originally introduced in  @xcite , but no analysis was given in that reference .",
    "the fredholm property of the caldern - ikawa cfier operators is established based on techniques developed in  @xcite , and their injectivity is a consequence of certain well known positivity properties of single layer operators with purely imaginary wavenumbers .",
    "in contrast to the caldern - complex cfier formulations , the caldern - ikawa cfier formulations do not lead to iterations counts independent of the wavenumber .",
    "indeed , we establish rigorously in this paper that the condition numbers of the caldern - ikawa cfier grow like @xmath2 as @xmath3 in the case of spherical scatterers of radius one .",
    "a key ingredient in the proof of this result is the coercivity of the caldern - ikawa cfier operators in the case of spherical geometries .",
    "we recall that if @xmath4 is a hilbert space , an operator @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the dual of @xmath4 ) is coercive if there exists a constant @xmath7 such that @xmath8 for all @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the duality pairing between @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "our analysis uses and extends coercivity results introduced in  @xcite . in order to put things into perspective",
    ", we mention that in the case of unit spheres the condition numbers of the classical brackhage - werner cfie formulations of helmholtz equations with dirichlet boundary conditions grow like @xmath11 as @xmath3  @xcite and those of the ikawa cfier formulations of helmholtz equations with neumann boundary conditions also grow like @xmath11 as @xmath3  @xcite .    another important contribution in this paper is a rigorous analysis of cfier formulations that use fourier multiplier operators whose principal symbol ( in the sense of pseudodifferential operators ) coincides with those of the efie regularizers described above .",
    "such formulations were originally introduced in  @xcite without a rigorous analysis , and very recently implemented in  @xcite . in our analysis , establishing the fredholm property of the principal symbol cfier relies on the pseudodifferential calculus , whereas their injectivity follows from the helmholtz decomposition and simple algebraic manipulations .    after discussing various cfier formulations that require on _",
    "complexified _ regularizing operators , we present extensive numerical results on the performance of solvers based on optimally designed caldern - complex cfier , caldern - ikawa cfier , and the classical cfie formulations for smooth convex and non - convex scatterers ans a very wide range of high frequencies spanning from @xmath12 to @xmath13 wavelengths .",
    "our numerical results are produced by our fast , high - order nystrm discretization implementation of various boundary integral equation formulations considered in this text .",
    "the details of our nystrm method were presented in our previous contribution  @xcite ; we use overlapping partitions of unity and analytical resolution of kernel singularities to evaluate accurately the integral operators .",
    "we use an accelerated version of our algorithms that generalizes to the electromagnetic case the fft `` equivalent sources '' accelerated algorithms in  @xcite . for scatterers with slowly varying curvatures ,",
    "our solvers based on the novel caldern - complex cfier formulations have the remarkable property that the number of krylov subspace linear algebra solvers are virtually independent of frequency in the high - frequency range .",
    "this is in contrast with the behavior of our solvers based on caldern - ikawa cfier and cfie formulations .",
    "although the cost of a matrix - vector product related to the caldern - complex cfier formulations is on average @xmath14 times more expensive than that related to the classical cfie formulations and @xmath15 times more expensive than that related to the caldern - ikawa cfier formulations introduced in our previous effort  @xcite , the remarkably fast rate of convergence of solvers based on the former formulations garners important computational gains over the other two formulations .",
    "specifically , in the high - frequency regime ( e.g. problems of electromagnetic size of @xmath13 wavelengths ) the computational gains of solvers based on the novel caldern - complex cfier formulations over solvers based on classical cfie formulations can be of factors @xmath16 .",
    "the computational gains over solvers based on the caldern - ikawa cfier  @xcite can be of factors @xmath17 .    the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ cfie ] we introduce and analyze a wide class of caldern cfier formulations ; in section  [ pscfier ] we introduce and analyze the principal symbol counterparts of the caldern cfier formulations , in section  [ spec_prop_cfie ] we analyze the spectral properties of the cfier operators for spherical geometries ; in section  [ dtn ] we present a methodology of selecting the complex wavenumbers in the definition of regularizing operators so that to lead to nearly optimal approximations of dirichlet - to - neumann operators in the case of spherical geometries ; and in section  [ num_exp ] we present several numerical results that enable comparisons between the performance of our solvers based on fast , high - order nystrm discretizations of various integral formulations of pec scattering problems .",
    "we consider the problem of evaluating the scattered electromagnetic field @xmath18 that results as an incident field @xmath19 impinges upon the boundary @xmath20 of a perfectly conducting scatterer @xmath21 .",
    "defining the total field by @xmath22 , the scattered field is determined uniquely by the time - harmonic maxwell equations for wavenumbers @xmath23 @xmath24 together with the perfect - conductor ( pec ) boundary conditions @xmath25 and the well known silver - mller radiation conditions at infinity on @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "here and in what follows we assume that @xmath20 is smooth ( actually @xmath27 would suffice ) and @xmath28 denote unit normals to the surface @xmath20 pointing into @xmath29 .",
    "integral equation formulations for electromagnetic scattering problems can be derived starting from magnetic and electric dipole distributions .",
    "given a tangential density @xmath30 on the scatterer @xmath20 , the magnetic dipole distribution corresponding to the density @xmath30 is defined as @xmath31 and the electric dipole distribution corresponding to the tangential density @xmath32 is defined as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the outgoing fundamental solution attributed to the helmholtz operator , @xmath35 . both @xmath36 and @xmath37 are radiative solutions of the electromagnetic wave equation @xmath38 in @xmath29 . the limits on @xmath20 of @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be expressed in the following form  @xcite : @xmath41 in equations   @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote the magnetic and respectively the electric field integral operators .",

    "regularized combined field integral equations for the solution of electromagnetic scattering problems with perfectly electrically conducting boundary conditions seek representations of the electromagnetic fields of the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes a tangential operator to be specified in what follows .",

    "operators @xmath49 with the aforementioned property are referred to as right regularizing operators for the operators @xmath43 .",

    "operators @xmath49 with the aforementioned property have been proposed and analyzed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a general strategy to produce and analyze novel regularizing operators @xmath49 and to analyze previously introduced regularizing operators for which an analysis does not exist in the literature .",
    "the starting point of constructing suitable regularizing operators @xmath49 is the caldern s identity @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "the regularizing operators @xmath49 should thus resemble the electric field operator @xmath43 .",
    "if the choice @xmath59 were made , the ensuing cfier operators would not be injective since for certain wavenumbers @xmath60 the operators @xmath61 are not injective  @xcite . in order to ensure the injectivity of the resulting cfier operators ,",
    "one strategy is to modify the wavenumber in the definition of the regularizing operator @xmath59 .",

    "<S> we refer to these operators as caldern - complex cfier , we show numerical evidence that those complex wavenumbers can be selected in a manner that leads to cfier formulations whose condition numbers can be bounded independently of frequency for spherical geometries . in addition , the caldern - complex cfier operators possess excellent spectral properties in the high - frequency regime for both convex and non - convex scatterers . </S>",
