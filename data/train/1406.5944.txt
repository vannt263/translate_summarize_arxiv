    "the redshift of spectral absorption lines from the solar photosphere has been known empirically since 1896 @xcite and was then interpreted in terms of pressure shifts in the plasma of the solar photosphere .",
    "the formulation of the principle of equivalence and later of the general theory of relativity @xcite indicated that this phenomenon was due to the difference in gravitational potentials between the solar photosphere and the earth s surface .",
    "this encouraged extensive observational work that has established with certainty that the solar redshifting of spectral lines is quite a complex phenomenon with the posibility of velocity fields , collisional efects , magnetic effects and other factors adding to the gravitational redshift ( hereafter grs ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast with astrophysical applications of the grs , an experimental test became possible only after the discovery of the msbauer effect and is undoubtedly capable of substantial improvemente in the future . moreover , the use of atomic clocks @xcite has improved the accuracy of the measurements .",
    "there is no doubt that better clocks , as well as laser - based frequency standards , will make further improvements possible of the accuracy of measurements of the grs on the earth s surface or in near - earth space in the near future .",
    "moreover , the use of laser - frequency combs is becoming a possibility for astronomical observations too @xcite .",
    "there has also been progress in our understanding of the conditions any theory has to satisfy in order to account for the grs and also the implications of the existence of the grs .",
    "these considerations show that a wide class of theories predict an identical grs , and it is now appreciatted that it is a rather weak test of relativistic theories of gravitation .",
    "however , @xcite points out that a measurement of the solar grs , being over a distance very much greater than the scale height of the gravitational field is in principle preferable to local laboratory experiments and can test the validity of the minimum coupling principle .    in the final decades of the 20th century several measurements of the solar grs were made using various techniques , such as improved solar spectrographs @xcite and atomic beams @xcite .",
    "the reported agreement with theoretical predictions for the strong resonance absorption lines of potassium and sodium , which are formed high in the photosphere , are within observational error of some 10% , including systematic effects .",
    "more recently @xcite , there has been a better comprehension of the solar effects that add to the grs , thereby reducing systematic errors and improving the results obtained .",
    "moreover , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite introduced the use of alkali - vapour cells based resonant scattering spectrophotometers in the measurement of radial velocities in the sun s photosphere when observed as a star , resulting in an improvement of more than an order of magnitude over existing techniques @xcite .",
    "works based on this technique , and some others , led to the discovery of solar oscillations and the birth of helioseismology .",
    "one such key instrument @xcite , named marki , designed and built at the university of birmingham ( uk ) , has been in operation since 1975 at the observatorio de el teide ( canary islands , spain ) .",
    "the dedication of this apparatus for such a longtime to solar observations has provided an enormous amount of valuable data and moreover , it served as a reference for other similar instrumentation build and operated later on , both in ground and in space .",
    "now , with some historical perspective too , in a series of two papers we summarize the long standing observations and results achieved , we analyse the whole data obtained till now and report new findings and discoveries resulting from the precise measurements of the doppler shifts of the 7699 resonance line of neutral potassium atom in the light integrated over the entire sun ( the sun viewed as any other star ) .    in this first paper , we briefly describe the apparatus , the observations achieved and the results of the analysis of its long - term time stability velocity signal which provided a long series of grs measurements spaning from the years 1976 to 2013 . in the second paper ,",
    "a full in - depth description of the calibration of the data will be given and results of the analysis of the spectrum of the oscillations of the sun along three full solar activity cycles will be presented .",
    "principle of operation of the vapour cell resonant scattering spectrophotometry ( see text ) .",
    "the relative displacement of the solar line with respect to the laboratory ones can be calculated by measuring at both wings ( r and l ) and making an appropriate ratio between both . in our case , observing integral sunlight with ki7699   line , the dynamical range of the velocity shift spans from -300 m s@xmath2 ( end september ) to 1500 m s@xmath2 ( beginning april ) . ]",
    "the method used by resonant scattering spectrophotometry has already been described in detail @xcite and may be summarized here using fig .",
    "[ figlines ] as a reference .",
    "circularly polarized light with an absorption line , represented by the solid black curve , is incident on a suitable atomic vapour cell having a resonance line overlapping with the solar absorption line , placed in a longitudinal magnetic field of such strength as to locate the zeeman components ( blue and red curves ) near the steepest parts of the solar absorption line .",
    "the intensity of resonantly scattered light due to left - handed circularly polarized incident light is given by @xmath3 , whereas that due to right - handed circularly polarized light is given by @xmath4 .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ figlines ] that , when there is no relative displacement between the incident spectral line ( dashed line ) and the laboratory lines , @xmath3 equals @xmath4 .",
    "if , however , there is a relative shift between both lines , as illustrated in the figure ( solid line ) , the two intensities are no longer equal , and the ratio defined as    @xmath5    gives a measure of the line shift corrected for intensity fluctuations to first order .",
    "since the narrow laboratory zeeman components scan the steepest parts of the broader solar line as the earth spins , this method is extremely sensitive to very small shifts . in this experiment natural potassium vapour",
    "was used to study the relative position of the ki7699    absorption line with respect to the observatory .",
    "the solar line has a full width at half depth of 6.23 km s@xmath2 , while the region probed by the laboratory lines is of order of 1.8 km s@xmath2 , thus the ratio @xmath6 will be almost linearly related to the velocity shift between the sun and the laboratory to a first order approximation ; in fact , a constant calibration of 3000 converts the ratio into velocity in m s@xmath2 @xcite . a more detailed account of modifications due to the hyperfine structure and isotopic composition can be found in the more detailed and comprehensive paper @xcite .",
    "the marki apparatus , was developed and built at birmingham university ( uk ) during 1973 and 1974 , and was gradually improved over the following five years .",
    "a detailed account of its state during 1976 and 1977 in its first location in the _ casa solar _ at the observatorio de el teide ( tenerife , spain ) is to be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "briefly , a small , equatorially mounted servo - controlled heliostat ( with flat mirrors ) directs disc - integrated sunlight , suitably filtered by a thermostatically controlled interference filter centred at 7699    with a bandwidth of 15   , through a polarizer and an electro - optical light modulator , which alternately produces the required left- or right - handed circular polarization by the application of appropriate electric potential .",
    "the light then enters a vapour cell situated in a longitudinal field provided by a permanent magnet ( 0.18 t ) ; the resonantly scattered light is then detected by a cooled photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) , and the processed output pulses are recorded for subsequent computer analysis . in order to test for various optical and electronic asymmetries and to assess the overall stability of the system , a light source on its own or a white light ( quartz - iodine ) with a vapour cell in a transverse magnetic field to provide an artificial absorption line simulating the solar potassium line was also used .",
    "from 1975 onwards , the marki instrument has been used exclusively to study the oscillations of the sun as a star , and the measurement of the grs is a byproduct that will be studied in this work .",
    "the one and only exception was in the 1979 summer campaign , in which the apparatus was used to look at different parts of the solar disc .",
    "integrated sunlight helps to reduce the random shifts of the spectral line due to small scale motions in the solar photosphere .",
    "moreover , it has the advantage that the rotation of the sun is averaged to zero and possible instrumental errors due to imprecise guiding or atmospheric turbulence become minimized .",
    "small signals due to angular non - uniformities on the photosphere , such as sunspots , or in sky transmission , or instrumental errors will be discussed later on .",

    "bottom : monthly averages ( over the observed years ) of the duty cycle with its standard deviations . ]",
    "marki was taken to the observatorio de el teide in 1975 and began operation by the end of that summer for only a few days .",
    "several long summer observing campaigns were then carried out there until 1984 . during those years",
    "marki s performance was being monitored and used to develop other apparatus , based on the same principle , that helped to establish helioseismology as an astrophysical discipline in its own right .",
    "moreover , from summer 1985 onwards , the observations were taken on a continuous daily basis in a fairly undisturbed and regular observational procedure .",
    "its precise location at the observatory has been changed twice , the most recent being in 1986 when it was moved to its current location , the solar lab named _ pirmide van der raay_. from 1993 onwards , it is also a node of the bison helioseismology network @xcite .",
    "the sunlight enters the spectrophotometer through an open - air double flat mirror heliostat system . the two - axis servo - controlled primary mirror ( which also moves along the north ",
    "south line throughout the year ) feeds a fixed secondary mirror , which provides a horizontal sunlight beam towards the spectrophotometer room .",
    "this system , although symmetric about noon , has to be altered by changing the secondary mount at the equinoxes , otherwise it will cast shadow on to the primary around noon . before 1979 ,",
    "the heliostat system was different and had an extra fixed flat mirror to accommodate the sunlight beam properly ; also , the mirrors were of lower quality .",
    "minor changes in the core parts of the apparatus have been introduced , and it can be said that , up till 2009 , marki has been working without interruption , weather permitting , other than a few failures that have been solved quite rapidly .",
    "the main changes have been in the electronic readout system that evolved from fast analogue electronics and seven - track magnetic tapes to fast digital electronics and a microcomputer system with cassette tapes in 1984 ; obviously , new computer hardware and software has been incorporated to the apparatus as it has become available and possible .",
    "its performance has been outstandingly good ; just recently , in october 2009 , the vapour cell and pmt had to be changed because of darkening of the windows in the former and loss in efficiency in the latter , which lowered the count rate and signal - to - background ratio .",
    "the raw data consist of a one - second measurement on the left - hand side of the line followed by a second on the right hand .",
    "the count in each channel usually spans from 0.1 to 1 @xmath7 counts per second depending on sky transparency , thin cirrus and mirror cleanliness .",
    "furthermore , the ratio is calculated by finding its average and standard deviation on the basis of blocks of 42 s ( 40 s from 1984 on ) , which , when calibrated to velocity , results in an error of @xmath8 1 m s@xmath2 .",
    "the census of the observations during these years can be seen in figure  [ figyears ] .",
    "longer runs have been achieved in summer months when a higher number of daytime hours and cloudless days is more frequent ; june , july and august are consistently the best months of the year . however , in winter the duty cycle is consistently lower even though the transparency of the sky is better ; december and march are the months with the lowest duty cycle ( around 40% ) .",
    "note that , up to 1985 , observations were taken only in summer - month campaigns .",
    "the duration of failures due to instrumental problems would be equivalent to a couple of useful days per year on average .    to summarize the amount of data in hand in a few numbers , it may be said that in the period from july 1976 to december 2013 , with a total span of 13672 days , we have observed for 8849 days . however , in the period from june 1984 to december 2013 , where daily observations are available , out of a total span of 10958 days we obtained 8390 days of observations for a duty cycle of 49% of all possible daily hours .",

    "the actual way of measuring the crossing time is shown in fig .",
    "[ figanual ] ( bottom ) ; following the use of a moving mean filter , a straight line is fitted and the crossing time and its uncertainty calculated . the fit has been made with and without filtering ; moreover , several appropriate filters were also checked without significant changes in the result .    for any one year of observation typically under 90 daily independent measurements",

    "[ figvgrsanual ] , where the crossing time over that season is shown ( top graph ) , while in the bottom graph the calculated @xmath31 daily values are also plotted .",
    "it can be seen that the average value in that year , 589.7 @xmath1 0.3 m s@xmath2 , is not the one expected from the first term alone ; therefore , @xmath32 is not null .",
    "moreover , there are day - to - day variations well outside the errors on each measurement . such daily peak - to - peak variations , around 10 m s@xmath2 and periods around half the solar rotation period ( see fig .  [ figvgrsanual ] ) , clearly suggest the activity features in the photosphere moving across the visible solar hemisphere .",
    "therefore , we need to understand this result , which is rather similar in all years with observed data .    moreover , these calculations are done over all the days of observation in which it is possible to obtain the crossing time and the results are plotted in figure  [ figrawvgrsanual ] . in this figure",
    "the measurements show a mean value of 601.14 @xmath1 0.15 m s@xmath2 , which is some 32 m s@xmath2 lower than the predicted grs velocity .",
    "therefore , the @xmath32 term will be non - zero owing to contributions from several sources , both solar and instrumental .      a second method to daily measure the grs would be to perform a measurement at noon time .",
    "as explained in section [ sec : analisis ] , notice that when @xmath33 the term @xmath34 and the equation [ eqvobs ] can be expressed as : @xmath35     results of the offset velocity @xmath36 and the calibration @xmath37 obtained with the noon - measurement method for the year 2002 .",

    ", this method allows a daily measurement along the whole year , provided the method of calibration is precise and stable enough . although a full and precise description of the calibration procedure involving explanations and corrections of non - linear terms will be done in detail in the second paper of this series , we will provide here arguments that prove that under the best conditions ( those very close to the linear regime ) the results obtained for the grs velocity coincide with the above explained null method .    a very simple and effective way of daily calibrating the measurements can be described as follows . from fig.[figanual ] and equation [ eqvobs ]",
    ", the measured ratio at any time can be expressed in the following way : @xmath41\\ ] ] therefore , assuming a linear relation between ratio and velocity , this equation can be fit to the observations of any single day and obtain the daily values of the calibration @xmath37 and the velocity offset @xmath42 as :    @xmath43    and @xmath44    the results obtained for a typical year , say 2002 , are shown in fig.[figcali ] . as it can be seen , from beginning of august to beginning of december is when the measurements are done under the most favourable conditions ( when the most symmetric parts of the line are being sampled.see fig.[figlines ] ) and both , calibration and velocity offset , are almost constant ; notice that this is precisely the same epoch where the crossing time method ( described above ) can be applied . on the contrary , when measurements are done in the least favourable conditions , around april when the sampled parts on the wings of the line are asymmetric , the calibration changes by some 35% and the offset velocity also changes accordingly .",
    "it can also be noticed that in this later case the scatter of the points is higher than in the former .",
    "notice also that the null measurement method , when applicable , coincides extremely well with those obtained with this method ( the average of the differences is 0.6 @xmath1 0.2 ms@xmath2 ) .    in order to better calibrate the apparatus along the whole year",
    "it is necessary to linearise the measurements ( to correct for the non  linearity of the line profile ) in such a way that the results for the calibration become as constant as possible along the whole year .",
    "although some methodology for very similar observations has been extensively described already in the past ( see for instance @xcite , in the next paper of this series it will be fully discussed .",
    "figure  [ figvgrsanual ] shows a clear daily variation with periods around half the solar rotation period , the so called 13-day period variation due to the passage of sunspots and other inhomogeneities across the visible solar photosphere , already pointed out in the past by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "moreover , the @xmath32 term will , or can , have contributions from many other sources , mainly solar but also instrumental . in this section",
    "we will try to understand such contributions .",
    "the signal due to the passage of magnetic activity features over the visible solar hemisphere can be modelled by trying to match the observed data and can eventually be subtracted from observations . a simple model has been developed using the impressive sunspot data archive in noaa - ngdg ( http://ngdc.noaa.gov/ ) , where daily sunspot areas and positions are recorded from well before our observations began up till now with very few gaps .",
    "the numerical model is fairly simple and has been used in slightly different ways in the past ( see the above - mentioned authors ) . in this paper",
    "we have followed the work of @xcite .",
    "the numerical model simulates , at any point on the solar surface , all known line - of - sight relative velocities of the sun with respect to earth and the way the apparatus makes the measurement of the solar lines over the period of a year .",
    "data on the potassium solar line , both in the quiet sun and in the sunspots , are taken from observations in the literature @xcite .",
    "all involved lines ( solar and laboratory ) are taken as gaussians , which is a good enough approximation for the scanning interval at work in the experiment .",
    "moreover , it also includes the so - called limb - shift effect , which is caused by the granulation velocity fields present in the suns photosphere whose effect result in asymmetries in the spectral lines ( the c - shapes bisectors ) , and change as we move from centre to limb @xcite . as we observe the sun as a star , the measurements will be affected by the disc - integrated result of this effect and for the ki7699   line it has been measured in the past @xcite and studied theoretically by @xcite , turning out to be small , with some differences among various authors .",
    "we have used an average value of the measured effect from the above mentioned authors , whose shift of the line is approximated by a second order polynomial in @xmath45 ( @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the heliocentric angle ) .",
    "finally , it should be stated that the numerical model designed in this way has no free parameters .",
    "the daily results for years 2002 and 2008 ( high and low level magnetic activity years ) are shown in fig.[figanualsimul ] where the grs measurements obtained with the noon - measurement method ( see subsection [ sec : noongrs ] ) are also shown for comparison .",
    "these simulated results are also calculated for every day at noon and are expressed in velocity using the daily calculated calibration from the model .",
    "as it can be seen , the numerical model follows very well the daily observations on both years , showing that the model seems to work well , even in both extreme conditions ( the most favourable around october and the least favourable around april ) .",
    "the difference between both years ( diferent level of solar activity ) is in the average value of the observations ( 601.5 m s@xmath2 and 590.3 m s@xmath2 for 2008 and 2002 respectively ) . also , the annually averaged values of the simulated data show a slight difference between both years , being of 0.1 m s@xmath2 higher in 2008 ; other years with the highest activity only showed 1.5 m s@xmath2 less than the lowest minimum .",
    "the offset velocity between model and observations is of some 50 to 60 m s@xmath2 ; in order to obtain simulated values of grs close to the ones observed we have to use a value for @xmath23 of 585 m s@xmath2 instead the one theoretically predicted ( see section [ sec : analisis ] ) or to modify the limb - shift effect . on the other hand , in fig.[figanualsimul ]",
    "the relative difference between model and observations is also plotted ( mean value is substracted ) .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the flat part of the curve , from august to november , is better fitted than the rest of the year where a higher scatter ( more than a factor of two ) and some slight curvature is left over .",
    "this is very probably due to the fact that in the measuring conditions around april the approximation of the spectral lines by gaussians is not good enough and it would need a better treatment .",
    "therefore , in what follows , we will concentrate in the observations made with the null - measurement method which , by definition , are done in the most favourable conditions , do not depend on the calibration of the measurements and , anyway , they coincide very well with the noon - measurement method ( see fig.[figcali ] ) .    when the numerical simulation is applied to predict the grs measurements at the croosing time ( null - measurement method ) , the results found can be seen in fig .",

    "the top graph shows the result of the grs velocity variations for both years .",

    ", the simulated signal seems sometimes to lead the observed one ( as already pointed out in @xcite ) .",
    "these details would suggest that more realism in the simulation would be interesting and necessary , with the inclusion of the contribution from faculae , for instance , but this would be difficult owing to the lack of sufficient observational data for these features . moreover , the inclusion of a better approximation of the line profiles ( solar and lab ) would probably help to obtain a closer match of the amplitudes . in fig.[figrefer1 ] and fig.[figrefer2 ] the results obtained for the years 1984 to 2013 are shown .",

    "such tests were always performed by changing one parameter at a time and leaving at least a complete day of observation to be able to measure the potential effect of the change on the observed data . moreover , from 1985 onwards , some housekeeping data , such as temperatures at different points of the spectrophotometer ( allways kept below 1k fluctuations ) and guiding errors , have also been recorded .",
    "these are very small , for an integration time of 40 seconds the error is 1.8@xmath10.6 arcsec and it is below 0.1 arcsec for any given day . the pointing sensitivity has been measured to be less than 0.8 m s@xmath2/arcmin .    to summarize the results here , it can be said that the systematic errors ( mechanical , thermal , optical and electronic ) are kept well below the 1 m s@xmath2 level in all parts of the instrument .",
    "possible electronic assymetry between both channels ( l and r ) and long term instrumental stability were checked in dedicated long runs using appropriate calibration set - ups ; all tests have shown uncertainties of @xmath480.1 m s@xmath2 .",
    "moreover , the magnetic field of the permanent magnet showed no significant change over the years .",
    "however , the most sensitive source of error is misalignment of the electro - optical light modulator ( eolm ) with respect to the entrance beam",
    ". this can happen near the equinoxes , when the secondary mirror mounting has to be changed .",
    "this is a major change and the alignment is checked , a realignement usually being required ; however , the same relative position between the entrance beam and the eolm axis is sometimes not achieved , resulting in a slight change in the offset velocity . the resulting effect on the daily offset velocity measurement",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figmounts ] with an example ; in the graph , the day of the mount changeover is shown by a green vertical line , and a step in the measured velocity can be seen . by calculating the mean value of a few points before and after the mount changeover we can correct for such systematic effects .",
    "another systematic effect might come from the existence of the isotope @xmath49 with a proportion of 7.4% respect to @xmath50 which produces an isotopic shift of up to @xmath5198 m s@xmath2 as the optical thickness of the vapour changes from thin to thick @xcite .",
    "these effects will be measurable if the optical thickness of the gas is different in the cell from that on the sun s atmosphere , or if it changes with time .",
    "moreover , while there is no reason for a significant change in optical thickness on the sun , in the cell it can change only if the temperature of the oven heating the cell changes . this parameter has been measured ( every minute ) and recorded from 1985 onwards ; it is found to vary very smoothly during the day typically by @xmath1 1 degree ( which represents 0.7% ) owing to room temperature variations .",
    "the same cell was used from 1976 to 2009 ; in the years 1977 , 1985 and 2000 tests were performed by carefully changing the setting of the oven voltage heating circuit by an amount as high as 10% ( in power ) , with very small effects of less than 0.5 m s@xmath2/% being found in the results .",
    "instrumental effect on the observed grs velocity due to the summer to winter secondary mirror mount changeover ( a green vertical line shows the precise day ) and the corresponding re - alignement .",
    "notice that if a positive shift is added to the black dot points following the mount changeover s day to obatin the red open circle points , the observed velocity now shows a nice continuity with the observations obtained before . ]",
    "once the numerically calculated effect of the passage of the sunspots is corrected , yearly averages of the grs velocity are obtained ; these are plotted in figure  [ figvgrsobser ] . as can be seen , there are some points that diverge considerably from the mean value such as those obtained during the first three years ; data from 1976 to 1978 result some 25 to 30 m s@xmath2 lower than the rest .",
    "this is interpreted as an instrumental effect brought about by the fact that , in these years , the heliostat system that feeds the spectrophotometer with the incident beam was different ( the primary was displaced from the north  south line defined by the secondary and had to be changed at noon ) from that used afterwards and included mirrors of much lower quality . moreover , in 1983 we had very few useful results ( as much as six ) as the electronic channel analyser in the data collection system did not work properly and had to be replaced .",
    "these points have therefore been disregarded .",
    "finally , in the years 1990 to 1993 , the systematic effect in the secondary mount changeover was kept 14 m s@xmath2 too high . once these considerations were taken into account and the data points",
    "were corrected , a second definitive graph ( see black dots in fig .  [ figvgrsobser ] ) was produced .",
    "these changes have been considered in the data and the final average found is 600.38 @xmath1 0.78 m s@xmath2 , which corresponds to 94.75 @xmath1 0.1 % of the full effect predicted by the principle of equivalence . note that the statistical error is the lowest ever measured on the sun .",
    "however , it also shows a variation of @xmath52 5 m s@xmath2 with a period of 1012 years , which is very close to the solar activity cycle s mean periodicity . in order to understand this effect we have plotted , in fig .",
    "[ figtotal ] , the results found , together with an average of the international sunspot number over the same days where we had grs data , taken from @xcite ( http://sidc.oma.be/sunspot-data/ ) . a clear anti - correlation can be seen between the two graphs , suggesting an explanation in terms of magnetic activity influencing the symmetry of the solar line profile .",
    "such a 5% difference from the predicted grs value can be explained as follows .",
    "the only instrumental error that can account for such difference is that in the optical depth of the potassium atoms in the sun rather than in the cell ; if this were so , the differential isotopic shift could explain the difference .",
    "however , in our opinion , this is not the most plausible explanation .",
    "the solar line is a strong resonance line that is optically thick in the sun . in the laboratory the vapour cell , in the marki apparatus",
    ", the optical depth depends on the number of atoms present in its head , which is a consequence of the temperature at which the cell is being heated .",
    "the voltage in the oven is supplied by a very stable power supply that heats the cell up to 360 k ; the oven voltage is measured with a thermistor , which shows that the temperature is kept stable close to 0.1 k during observations .",
    "the temperature is set so that a plateau in the scattered intensity is achieved ; in these conditions the vapour is optically thick in the cell s head .",
    "however , @xcite in a research note reports the measurement of 16.4 @xmath1 1 m , which corresponds to 638 @xmath1 39 m s@xmath2 using a potassium - based atomic beam resonant scattering spectrometer .",
    "given that the error is much higher than ours , the difference in the value found here can be explained because in our case we are measuring integral sunlight rather than using a small aperture in the centre of the sun s image , therefore using a differently averaged solar potassium line profile and also a differently averaged solar limb shift effect .",
    "yearly averages of the observed velocities ( cyan squares ) following the subtraction of the solar activity effect on the measurements . in black circles ,",
    "the same data once some values ( 199093 ) for instrumental systematic errors are corrected and others ( 19761978,1983 ) due to different heliostat set - up ( see text ) are removed . ]     final yearly averages of the grs observed velocity ( dots ) and averages of the international sunspot number ( triangles ) calculated over the same time interval than the observations . ]",
    "the limb shift effect of this solar line , and the grs itself , have also been measured by @xcite at the mac math - pierce solar telescope also using a small aperture on a large solar image .",
    "they also measured 99 @xmath1 7 % of the full predicted grs value and a small linear limb shift .",
    "another measurement of this effect has also been made by @xcite , who found a non - linear limb shift increasing rapidly when approaching the solar limb .",
    "the difference between both seems to be in the amount of scattered light from the centre of the sun in the measurements at positions approaching the limb ; in both works , the position of the solar line is determined by appropriately fitting its minimum .",
    "a third measurement came from our own group @xcite , which found an intermediate result .",
    "moreover , in our numerical simulation ( see subsection [ sec : corsolares ] ) we find that the effect averaged over the whole sun is @xmath8 15 m s@xmath2 .",
    "the resonant scattering experiments measure the solar line in its wings rather than by finding the minimum .",
    "therefore , if the line is not symmetric the measurement can be either blue- or redshifted with respect to the minimum .",
    "measurements of the asymmetry of the ki7699    line made by @xcite and @xcite show that , at between 30 and 60% of the residual intensity , it is blueshifted at the centre of the sun , while close to the limb it is centred or even redshifted with respect to the minimum .",
    "using integral sunlight , @xcite find that the wings are blueshifted by @xmath8 50 @xmath1 30 m s@xmath2 with respect to the minimum .",
    "very similar results are obtained if we analyze the data on the ki7699   line from the integral sunlight atlas taken at kitt peak @xcite .",
    "taking such considerations into account , we believe this latter explanation , asymmetry of the solar line ( -50 m s@xmath2 ) plus residual limb shift effect ( 15 m s@xmath2 ) , explains the average grs measured value .",
    "the solar gravitational redshift measured in the ki7699    line for the years 1976 to 2013 has been obtained as a by - product of the measurements of solar oscillations taken on integral sunlight at observatorio de el teide , from 1976 to 2013 , using the resonant scattering spectrometer marki .    the average result over this period results in 600.4 @xmath1 0.8 m s@xmath2 , with a clear variation , which is in anti - correlation with the phase of the solar activity cycle , of roughly @xmath1 5 m s@xmath2 .",
    "although the statistical error bar is the lowest ever measured , correction for this effect should bring it even lower .",
    "these measurements are amongst the most precise ever made of the solar gravitational redshift and the most numerous .",
    "the value found for the grs is 33 m s@xmath2 lower than the theoretically value expected ( 5% of the full effect ) .",
    "we believe that , besides considerations already taken into account , the anti - correlation found between the variations around the mean value and the solar activity cycle also suggest that the discrepancy can be attributed to the overall assymetry of the sun - integrated ki7699   spectral line changing with magnetic activity .",
    "an obvious consequence that can also be derived is that , when the radial velocities of other stars are studied , the currently reported findings warn against interpretations such as possible planets or other components orbiting around them , without first checking for stellar magnetic activity effects .    to improve this result",
    "it would be very convenient to avoid the use of solar magnetic sensitive lines .",
    "moreover , the use of integral sunlight prevents observational problems , such as diffuse light , specially when measuring near the limb .",
    "however , the determination of the overall effect on integral sunlight of the convective limb - shift , in order to properly correct the measurements , is a very difficult task .",
    "therefore , the use of spectral lines with small limb - shift would also be advisable .",
    "the data used in this work , their temporal coverage spanning almost 40 years ( an astronomer s lifetime ) , their continuity and quality , have involved the contribution of many individuals who developed and maintained the apparatus , the site where it stands and performed the observations , and also the support of several governmental funding institutions from spain and the uk . it all started forty years ago , through a collaboration between the hires group at the physics department of the university of birmingham ( ub , uk ) and the solar section of the instituto universitario de astrofsica at the universidad de la laguna ( ull , spain ) .",
