    "this paper reports the results of a study of the properties of the hadronic final state in positron - proton deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "the event kinematics of dis are determined by the negative square of the four - momentum transfer of the virtual exchanged boson , @xmath4 , and the bjorken scaling variable , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the four - momentum of the proton . in the quark parton model ( qpm ) ,",
    "the interacting quark from the proton carries four - momentum @xmath7 the variable @xmath8 , the fractional energy transfer to the proton in its rest frame , is related to @xmath1 and @xmath0 by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the positron - proton centre of mass energy .",
    "a natural frame in which to study the dynamics of the hadronic final state in dis is the breit frame  @xcite . in this frame",
    "the exchanged virtual boson is completely space - like and has a four - momentum @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the momentum of the proton in the breit frame .",
    "the particles produced in the interaction can be assigned to one of two regions : the current region if their @xmath13-momentum in the breit frame is negative , and the target region if their @xmath13-momentum is positive .",
    "the advantage of this frame is that it gives a maximal separation of the incoming and outgoing partons in the qpm . in this model",
    "the maximum momentum a particle can have in the current region is @xmath14    the current region in the breit frame is analogous to a single hemisphere of @xmath2 annihilation . in @xmath15 annihilation",
    "the two quarks are produced with equal and opposite momenta , @xmath16 the fragmentation of these quarks can be compared with that of the quark struck from the proton which has outgoing momentum @xmath17 in the breit frame . in the direction of this struck quark the scaled momentum spectra of the particles , expressed in terms of @xmath18 are expected to have a dependence on @xmath19 similar to that observed in  annihilation  @xcite at energy @xmath20    within the modified leading log approximation ( mlla ) there are predictions of how the higher order moments of the parton momentum spectra should evolve with energy scale  @xcite .",
    "the parton level predictions depend on two free parameters , a running strong coupling , governed by a qcd scale @xmath21 and an energy cut - off , @xmath22 below which the parton evolution is truncated .",
    "the hypothesis of local parton hadron duality ( lphd )  @xcite , which relates the observed hadron distributions to the calculated parton distributions via a constant of proportionality , is used in conjunction with the predictions of the mlla allowing the calculation to be directly compared with data .",
    "the moments of the  distributions have been investigated up to the 4th order ; the mean @xmath23 width @xmath24 skewness @xmath25 and kurtosis @xmath26 were extracted from the distribution by fitting a distorted gaussian of the following form : @xmath27 where @xmath28 over a range of 3 units ( @xmath29 ) or 4 ( @xmath30 ) units in @xmath31 around the mean .",
    "the equation was motivated by the expression used for the mlla predictions of the spectra in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : qevol ] shows the skewness of the @xmath31 spectra as a function of @xmath32 it is evident that the skewness decreases with increasing @xmath33 similar fits performed on  data shows a reasonable agreement with our results at high @xmath34 consistent with the universality of fragmentation for this distribution .",
    "the ariadne monte carlo model  @xcite gives a reasonable description of the data .",
    "the data are compared with the mlla predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite , using a value of @xmath35 for different values of @xmath36 the mlla calculations predict a negative skewness which decreases towards zero with increasing @xmath19 in the case of the limiting spectra ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "this is contrary to the measurements .",
    "a reasonable description of the behaviour of the skewness with @xmath19 can be achieved for a truncated cascade ( @xmath38 ) , but a consistent description of the mean , width , skewness and kurtosis can not be achieved  @xcite . a range of @xmath39 values were investigated and none gave a good description of all the moments .",
    "we conclude that the mlla predictions , assuming lphd , do not describe the data .",
    "it should be noted though that a moments analysis has been performed  @xcite , taking into account the limitations of the massless assumptions of the mlla predictions , where good agreement was found between the limiting case of the mlla and @xmath40 data over a large range of energy , @xmath41",
    "charged particle distributions have been studied in the current region of the breit frame in dis .",
    "the moments of the @xmath31 spectra in the current region at high @xmath0 exhibit the same energy scale behaviour as that observed in @xmath2 data .",
    "the moments can not be described by the mlla calculations together with lphd ."
