    "<S> i discuss the low - energy limit of several processes involving only ordinary particles and gravitinos . </S>",
    "<S> astrophysical and laboratory applications are briefly addressed .    </S>",
    "<S> /#10=#1 - 00=5pt 0 by-00 by00.50 to0_/ _    0.2 cm    it is well known that the solution of the hierarchy problem in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ( sm ) requires a mass splitting @xmath0 tev between ordinary particles and their superpartners . </S>",
    "<S> this requirement , however , leaves largely undetermined the supersymmetry - breaking scale @xmath1 , or , equivalenty , the gravitino mass @xmath2 , @xmath3 being the planck mass . the ratio @xmath4 is given by the coupling of the goldstino to the matter sector under consideration . </S>",
    "<S> if this coupling is gravitational , of order @xmath5 , then @xmath6 is of order @xmath7 and supersymmetry breaking takes place at the intermediate scale @xmath8 gev . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if the goldstino coupling to matter is of order 1 , then @xmath1 is comparable to the mass splitting @xmath6 , and the gravitino becomes superlight , with a mass of about @xmath9 ev . in the absence of a theory of supersymmetry breaking , @xmath10 should be treated as a free parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> if the gravitino is superlight , then one expects a substantially different phenomenology from that characterizing the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . in this case , only the @xmath11 gravitino helicity states can be safely omitted from the low - energy effective theory , when gravitational interactions are neglected . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath12 helicity states , essentially described by the goldstino field , should instead be accounted for at low energy , because of their non - negligible coupling to matter . </S>",
    "<S> the lightest supersymmetric particle is the gravitino and peculiar experimental signatures can arise from the decay of the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle into its ordinary partner plus a gravitino @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , even when all superymmetric particles of the mssm are above the production threshold , interesting signals could come from those processes where only ordinary particles and gravitinos occur . </S>",
    "<S> as soon as the typical energy of the process is larger than @xmath7 , a condition always fulfilled in the applications discussed below , one can approximate the physical amplitudes by replacing external gravitinos with goldstinos , as specified by the equivalence theorem @xcite . if the masses of the ordinary particles involved are negligible with respect to the energy of interest , these processes are controlled by just one dimensionful parameter , the supersymmetry - breaking scale @xmath1 , entering the amplitudes in the combination @xmath13 , @xmath14 denoting the goldstino wave function .    </S>",
    "<S> this class of processes includes @xmath15 , @xmath16 , which may influence primordial nucleosynthesis , stellar cooling and supernovae explosion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> of direct interest for lep2 and for the future linear colliders is the reaction @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> partonic reactions such as @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 can be indirectly probed at the tevatron collider or in future hadron facilities . in the absence of experimental signals </S>",
    "<S> , one can use these processes to set absolute limits on the gravitino mass . at variance with other bounds on @xmath7 discussed in the literature @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> these limits have the advantage of not depending on detailed assumptions about the spectrum of supersymmetric particles . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the study of these processes can reveal unexpected features of the low - energy theory , which were overlooked in the standard approach to goldstino low - energy interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> the natural tools to analyse the above processes are the so - called low - energy theorems @xcite . according to these , the low - energy amplitude for the scattering of a goldstino on a given target is controlled by the energy  </S>",
    "<S> momentum tensor @xmath21 of the target . to evaluate the physical amplitudes , it is more practical to make use of an effective lagrangian , containing the goldstino field and the matter fields involved in the reactions , and providing a non - linear realization of the supersymmetry algebra @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in the non - linear construction of @xcite , the goldstino field @xmath14 and the generic matter field @xmath22 are incorporated into the following superfields : [ bigl ] _ ( q + ) _ </S>",
    "<S> = _ f + _ </S>",
    "<S> + i f ( ^ - ^ ) _ _ f +  , ( q + ) = + i f ( ^ - ^ ) _ +  . </S>",
    "<S> [ mat ] the goldstino  matter system is described by the supersymmetric lagrangian : d^2d^2| ^2 |^2  , [ inv1 ] where @xmath23 is the ordinary lagrangian for the matter system . </S>",
    "<S> this non - linear realization automatically reproduces the results of the low - energy theorems , in particular the expected goldstino coupling to the energy  </S>",
    "<S> momentum tensor @xmath21 associated to @xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternative approach consists in constructing a low - energy lagrangian , starting from a general supersymmetric theory defined , up to terms with more than two derivatives , in terms of a khler potential , a superpotential and a set of gauge kinetic functions . </S>",
    "<S> the effective theory can be obtained by integrating out , in the low - energy limit , the heavy superpartners @xcite .    when applied to the process @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> , the two procedures yield the same result . </S>",
    "<S> the only independent , non - vanishing , helicity amplitude for the process is : a(1,-1,1/2,-1/2)=8 ^ 22  e^4f^2  , [ aph ] where ( 1 , @xmath241 ) and ( 1/2 , @xmath241/2 ) are the helicities of the incoming and outgoing particles , respectively ; @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the goldstino energy and scattering angle in the centre - of - mass frame . </S>",
    "<S> the total cross section is @xmath27 .    in earlier cosmological and astrophysical applications , with a typical energy range from about 1 kev to 100 mev , a cross - section scaling as @xmath28 was assumed , giving rise to a lower bound on @xmath7 close to @xmath29 ev . </S>",
    "<S> when the correct energy dependence is taken into account , this bound is reduced by at least a factor 10 , and becomes uninteresting compared to those obtainable at colliders .    </S>",
    "<S> when considering @xmath16 , in the limit of massless electron , one has to face an unexpected result @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> on the one hand , by integrating out the heavy selectron fields , one finds the following helicity amplitude : a(1/2,-1/2,1/2,-1/2)=4 ( 1+)^2 e^4f^2  , [ ae1 ] all other non - vanishing amplitudes being related to this one . on the other hand , by using the non - linear realization of @xcite , one obtains : a(1/2,-1/2,1/2,-1/2)=4 ^ 2e^4f^2  . </S>",
    "<S> [ ae2 ] the amplitudes of eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ae1 ] ) and ( [ ae2 ] ) scale in the same way with the energy , but have a different angular dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we should conclude that the low - energy theorems of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite do not apply to the case of a massless fermion . </S>",
    "<S> a particularly disturbing aspect is that the non - linear realization of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ inv1 ] ) is supposed to provide the most general parametrization of the amplitude in question , independently of any considerations about the low - energy theorems . in the case at hand , </S>",
    "<S> the lagrangian of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ inv1 ] ) reads : _ </S>",
    "<S> e= d^2d^2| ^2 |^2  , [ inv1bis ] where @xmath25 and @xmath30 are the superfields associated to the two weyl spinors @xmath31 and @xmath32 describing the electron , according to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mat ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the solution to this puzzle @xcite is provided by the existence of an independent supersymmetric invariant that has been neglected up to now in the literature : _ e = d^2d^2| ( e ||e+e^c ||e^c )  . </S>",
    "<S> [ inv2 ] the amplitudes of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ae1 ] ) are reproduced by the combination @xmath33 .    on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , there is no reason to prefer either the result of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ae1 ] ) or that of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ae2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the process @xmath34 does not have a universal low - energy behaviour . in the framework of non - linear realizations , </S>",
    "<S> this freedom can be described by the invariant lagrangian @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a free parameter of the low - energy theory . </S>",
    "<S> the process @xmath37 suffers from a similar ambiguity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the soft and collinear part of the cross - section , which is the dominant one , is associated to the initial - state radiation and hence is determined by the cross - section for @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the total cross - section , with appropriate cuts on the photon energy and scattering angle , scales as @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the photon energy and angular distributions are not universal , as for the case of the goldstino angular distribution in @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> they could be completely determined only through a computation performed in the fundamental theory . from the non - observation of single - photon events above the sm background at lep2 </S>",
    "<S> , one can roughly estimate a lower bound on @xmath1 of the order of the machine energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the precise value of this limit would require the analysis of the relevant background , as well as the inclusion of the above mentioned theoretical ambiguity . </S>",
    "<S> however , in view of the quite strong power dependence of the cross - section on the supersymmetry - breaking scale , one expects only a small correction to the limit obtained by a rough dimensional estimate .    </S>",
    "<S> the partonic processes @xmath18 , @xmath19 are also expected to have cross - sections scaling as @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between data and sm expectations in @xmath40 and @xmath41 at the tevatron collider could then be used to infer a lower limit on @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected to be around the typical total energy of the partonic subprocess , about @xmath42 gev . </S>"
