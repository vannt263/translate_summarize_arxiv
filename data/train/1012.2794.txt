    "in quantum mechanics , the concept of phase for a radiation mode has always remained a somewhat controversial topic , with both fundamental and technological implications , see @xcite and references therein for a review .",
    "a major reason for this is that in trying to define the phase of a quantum oscillator one can clearly see the restrictions of the conventional approach which identifies observables as self - adjoint operators , or equivalently , their spectral measures .",
    "indeed , it can be shown that no spectral measure satisfies the physically relevant conditions posed on phase observables @xcite .",
    "however , this problem has been overcome with the introduction of the more general concept of observables as positive operator measures . in this approach the concept of a covariant phase observable ( cpo ) naturally emerges and these observables have been completely charaterized @xcite .",
    "an important class of cpos arise as the angle margins of certain covariant phase space observables , the most familiar example being the @xmath0-function of the field .",
    "their physical significance is further emphasized by the fact that any phase space observable can in principle be measured via eight - port homodyne detection , a method which was introduced in the microwave domain @xcite and then extensively analyzed in the optical domain @xcite .",
    "other multiport homodyne @xcite and heterodyne detection @xcite may be employed as well , the latter also in the presence of frequency mismatch @xcite .",
    "any realistic measurement is subject to noise due to imperfections in the measuring apparatus . in the case of eight - port homodyne detection ,",
    "one of the relevant sources of noise is the presence of detector inefficiencies . indeed , as reported in @xcite , the quantum efficiencies of commercially available detectors range from very high to as low as a few percents and their effect is far from being negligible . in",
    "eight - port homodyning the presence of detector inefficiencies causes a gaussian smearing on the measured observable @xcite .",
    "this appears as a convolution structure which causes the actually measured distributions to be smoothed versions of the ideal ones . as a matter of fact , quantum efficiencies of the photodetectors are traditionally assumed to be equal which results in a rotation invariant convolving measure . in other words ,",
    "the smoothing effect is the same in any direction in the phase space .",
    "a detailed analysis shows that this symmetry is lost if we drop the assumption of equal efficiencies @xcite .",
    "this loss of symmetry is crucial when the measurement is intended to gain information about the phase properties of the field , and it is the purpose of this paper to address this problem in detail .",
    "we consider two methods for regaining this lost symmetry . at",
    "first , we show that the efficiencies can be balanced by inserting an additional beam splitter in front of one of the photodetectors .",
    "this results in a decreased overall efficiency for the measurement scheme .",
    "we also show that the angle margin of the measured phase observable is never a smearing of the ideal one .",
    "we then consider the effect of squeezing the parameter field while keeping the efficiencies fixed .",
    "as it turns out , this also compensates the efficiencies mismatch , thus retrieving the lost symmetry .",
    "we also compare the two methods and show that the overall efficiency is always greater for the squeezing strategy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ observables ]",
    "we lay out the general framework and give the necessary definitions .",
    "section [ detector ] is devoted to the mathematical description of eight - port homodyne detection involving non - ideal photodetectors . in sections",
    "[ beamsplitter ] and [ squeezing ] we describe in some details the aforementioned methods of overcoming the problems arising from different quantum efficiencies .",
    "the conclusions and future outlooks are presented in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "let @xmath1 be the infinite dimensional separable hilbert space associated with a single mode electromagnetic field , and let @xmath2 denote the set of bounded operators acting on @xmath1 .",
    "we fix the photon number basis @xmath3 and denote by @xmath4 the number operator associated with this basis . by diagonality of a bounded operator",
    "we always mean diagonality with respect to the number basis .",
    "we will use without explicit indication the coordinate representation in which case @xmath1 is identified with @xmath5 and the basis vectors with hermite functions .",
    "the states of the field are represented by positive operators with unit trace , and the observables are represented by normalized positive operator measures @xmath6 , where @xmath7 stands for the borel @xmath8-algebra of subsets of the measurement outcome space @xmath9 . for a field in a state @xmath10 , the measurement outcome statistics of an observable @xmath11 is given by the probability measure @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "an observable @xmath13 is a _ covariant phase observable _ ( cpo ) if @xmath14 for all @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes addition modulo @xmath18 . according to the phase theorem ( * ? ? ?",

    "an observable @xmath23 is a _ covariant phase - space observable _ if @xmath24 for all @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 are the weyl operators .",
    "any covariant phase - space observable is generated by a unique positive unit trace operator @xmath8 so that the observable is of the form @xcite @xmath28 now let us denote by @xmath29 the angle margin of @xmath30 , that is , @xmath31 where the relation between the polar and cartesian coordinates is given by @xmath32 .",
    "the key result needed in our study is ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.1 ) which states that _ @xmath33 is a phase observable if and only if @xmath8 is diagonal_. the simplest and from the experimental point of view the most useful example is the case @xmath34 , that is , when the observable is generated by the vacuum state . in this case",
    "the phase distribution is just the angle margin of the husimi @xmath0-function of the field .",
    "it should be stressed that even though cpos arise naturally as the margins of covariant phase space observables , not all cpos are obtained in this way . in particular , the canonical phase observable is not the angle margin of any phase space observable @xcite . in order to go into the analysis of phase observables related to eight - port homodyne detection",
    ", we need to recall the details of the measurement scheme .",
    "this is the subject of the next section .",
    "the eight - port homodyne detector consists of four input modes , four balanced @xmath35:@xmath35 beam splitters , a phase shifter which provides a phase - shift of @xmath36 on one of the modes and four photodetectors with quantum efficiencies @xmath37 , @xmath38 ( see fig .",
    "[ eightport ] ) which are not assumed to be equal .",
    "the measured quantities are the suitably scaled photon number differences between modes 1 & 3 , and 2 & 4 , respectively .",
    "the signal field in mode 1 is the field under investigation while the parameter field in mode 2 determines the measured observable .",
    "the input mode 3 is left empty so it corresponds to a vacuum field and the local oscillator in mode 4 is in a coherent state @xmath39 . the procedure for obtaining the phase distribution with this setup",
    "can be described as follows .",
    "each experimental event consists of a simultaneous detection of the two commuting difference - photocurrents which trace a pair of field - quadratures .",
    "each event thus corresponds to a point in the complex plane and the phase value inferred from the event is the polar angle of the point itself .",
    "the experimental histogram of the phase distributions is obtained upon dividing the plane into infinitesimal   angular bins of equal width , from @xmath40 to @xmath18 , then counting the number of points which fall into each bin .",
    "we shall next go into the mathematical description in more detail .    : @xmath35 beam splitters , a phase shifter which provides a phase - shift of @xmath36 on one of the modes and four photodetectors with quantum efficiencies @xmath37 , @xmath38 which are not assumed to be equal .",
    "the measured quantities are the photon number differences between modes 1 & 3 , and 2 & 4 , respectively , rescaled by the amplitude of the local oscillator , i.e. a strong coherent state @xmath39 impinged into mode 4 .",
    "the signal field in mode 1 is the field under investigation , while the parameter field in mode 2 determines the measured observable .",
    "the input mode 3 is left empty so it corresponds to a vacuum field . ]    in order to obtain measurements of covariant phase - space observables , we need to take the high - amplitude limit , that is , assume a very strong local oscillator . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath41 is the state of the parameter field and we assume ideal detectors ( @xmath42 for all @xmath43 ) , the measured observable in the high - amplitude limit @xmath44 is @xmath45 , where the generating operator is @xmath46 ; here @xmath47 denotes the conjugation map @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the presence of detector inefficiencies causes a gaussian smearing so that the actually measured observable is given by @xmath49 defined as @xmath50 where @xmath51 $ ] is a probability measure with the density @xmath52 where @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the quantities @xmath54 and @xmath55 may be viewed as overall efficiencies related to the two balanced homodyne detectors in the scheme . in particular , @xmath56 the smeared phase - space observable is still covariant and thus generated by some positive trace one operator .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the convoluted state @xcite @xmath59 the angle margin of the measured phase space observable is then @xmath60 and the problem is to determine the conditions under which this is a cpo .",
    "in other words , we need to determine when the generating operator is diagonal . at first",
    "we give a partial characterization in the following proposition .",
    "[ diagonal ] if @xmath8 is diagonal , then @xmath61 is diagonal if and only if @xmath62 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath62 , then @xmath63 is diagonal if and only if @xmath64 is diagonal .",
    "first notice that any two trace class operators @xmath8 and @xmath10 are equal if and only if @xmath65= \\textrm{tr}[\\rho w(q , p)]$ ] for all @xmath26 and the diagonality is equivalent to the condition @xmath66 for all @xmath67 .",

    "if either of these functions is rotation invariant , their product is invariant if and only if the other function is also invariant .",
    "this proves the proposition .",
    "note that neither of the conditions in proposition [ diagonal ] is necessary for @xmath58 to be diagonal .",
    "indeed , consider a state @xmath72 where @xmath73 is an arbitrary diagonal state . for @xmath74",
    "this state is not diagonal . on the other hand ,",
    "since the measure @xmath75 has the density @xmath76 it follows from proposition [ diagonal ] and the associativity of convolutions ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.2 ) that @xmath77 is diagonal .",
    "we close this section with a conceptual remark .",
    "since the observable measured with this setup is the covariant phase space observable @xmath78 it is a slight misuse of terminology to call this a _",
    "direct _ measurement of the angle margin @xmath79 .",
    "however , the brief analysis below shows that this scheme can be used to directly measure @xmath79 .",
    "consider for convenience the case of ideal detectors .",
    "for a local oscillator with a finite intensity @xmath80 this scheme defines an observable @xmath81 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that , with the choice @xmath82 , @xmath83 weakly in the sense of probabilities ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "now @xmath84 is a discrete observable and the measurement outcomes consist of pairs @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath85 be the pointer function which assigns to each pair the corresponding argument , that is , @xmath86 defined by @xmath87 and denote @xmath88 , @xmath89 then it can be shown that @xmath90 weakly in the sense of probabilities and the same argumentation holds in the case of inefficient detectors . in this sense , by _ choosing _ to record only the values @xmath91 we see that eight - port homodyne detection in the high - amplitude limit can be used as a direct measurement of @xmath79 .",
    "suppose that the state of the parameter field is diagonal , for instance , a vacuum state . in order to obtain a cpo , we need to have @xmath92 . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ efficiency ] , a given value of @xmath93 can be obtained with infinitely many different values of @xmath94 and @xmath37 .",
    "it follows that there is a great deal of freedom in choosing the detectors in order to obtain the equality @xmath92 .",
    "this degree of freedom may be exploited to modify the measurement setup in order to compensate any difference in the overall efficiencies . indeed , suppose that the efficiencies @xmath37 are fixed and , for instance , @xmath95 .",
    "this means that the homodyne detector consisting of detectors @xmath96 and @xmath97 is more efficient than the other one .     as a function of @xmath94 and @xmath37",
    "the addition of a beam splitter with transparency @xmath98 can be used to balance the setup and and obtain @xmath99 . ]    since a photodetector with efficiency @xmath100 is equivalent to having a fictitious beam splitter with transparency @xmath100 in front of an ideal detector ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , one can artificially decrease the efficiency of , say , detector @xmath97 by placing an additional beam splitter with transparency @xmath98 in front of the detector .",
    "the resulting effective efficiency of @xmath97 is then @xmath101 and the new overall efficiency is @xmath102 hence , with the appropriate choice @xmath103 we may balance the setup and obtain @xmath99 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ efficiency ] .",
    "in other words , we achieve a cpo at the price of artificially decreasing the largest efficiency to the value of the smallest one . for the remainder of this section we denote @xmath104 and use the notation @xmath105 .    it is interesting to note that by balancing the efficiencies of the homodyne detectors we have a situation where both the actually measured observable and the one corresponding to ideal detectors are phase observables .",
    "therefore it is natural to study the connection between them .",
    "since the measured phase - space observable is a smearing of the ideal one , one might expect that this property is inherited into the angle margins , namely , that there exists a probability measure @xmath106 $ ] such that @xmath107 . however , this is not the case .",
    "the measured observable @xmath108 is never a smearing of @xmath33 .",
    "assume that @xmath109 for some probability measure @xmath110 .",
    "let @xmath111 and @xmath112 denote the phase matrices of @xmath108 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "it is easily verified using eq .",
    "that the matrix elements satisfy the relation @xmath113 where @xmath114 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that @xmath115 for all @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the phase matrix related to the observable @xmath118 .",
    "now both @xmath8 and @xmath119 are mixtures of number states and the convex structure is inherited into the corresponding observables , and thus into the phase matrices .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath120 for all @xmath121 .",
    "this , together with eq . shows that @xmath122 for all @xmath116 .",
    "it follows that @xmath123 which is possible if and only if @xmath124 .",
    "this is satisfied if and only if @xmath125 , that is , the detectors are ideal .    in the simplest case of the vacuum parameter field and balanced efficiencies",
    "the convoluted state can easily be calculated .",
    "first notice that the necessary matrix elements of the weyl operators are @xmath126 so that with the polar coordinates @xmath127 , one can calculate @xmath128 the convoluted state is thus @xmath129",
    "there is an interesting alternative to the method of balancing efficiencies considered above . as mentioned before , the requirement of equal efficiencies is necessary only in the case that the parameter field is in a diagonal state .",
    "therefore it is possible that for fixed efficiencies a suitably chosen non - diagonal state can be used to compensate for the difference in the efficiencies so that the convoluted state is diagonal .",
    "here we show that this can always be done by employing a suitable squeezed vacuum state as a parameter field .",
    "let us assume that we are able to prepare the parameter field into a squeezed vacuum state @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the squeezing parameter and @xmath132 .",
    "as in the proof of prop . [ diagonal ] , we need to study the rotation invariance of the function @xmath133 \\nonumber\\\\ = \\:&\\hat{\\mu}_{\\epsilon_{13},\\epsilon_{24 } } ( p ,- q )   \\label{eq } \\langle \\psi_a \\vert w(q , p ) \\vert \\psi_a\\rangle \\\\ = \\ : & e^{-\\left(\\frac{1-\\epsilon_{24}}{2\\epsilon_{24}}+\\frac{a}4\\right ) q^2- \\left(\\frac{1-\\epsilon_{13}}{2\\epsilon_{13}}+\\frac1{4a}\\right ) p^2 } \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is clear that this is invariant with respect to rotations if we can choose the squeezing parameter in such a way that the equality @xmath134 holds . solving eq .",
    "for @xmath135 we have @xmath136 where the solution with the plus sign is always positive .",
    "hence , we can compensate the difference in the efficiencies by using a suitably squeezed vacuum as the parameter field . in order to compare this with the method of balancing efficiencies we need to solve the spectral decomposition of the convoluted state @xmath137    first ,",
    "define a parameter @xmath138 so that by inserting the value of the squeezing parameter into eq .",
    "( [ eq ] ) we obtain @xmath139 = e^{-\\frac{\\eta}{4 } ( q^2 + p^2 ) } \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] on the other hand we know that @xmath140 so that @xmath141 = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\lambda_n \\langle n\\vert w(q , p )   \\vert n\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\   & = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\lambda_n e^{-\\frac{1}{4 } ( q^2 + p^2 ) }   l_n \\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}(q^2 + p^2)\\right ) \\label{lambda1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath142 denotes the @xmath143-th laguerre polynomial . upon rewriting the exponential function in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) using the series representation @xcite ) @xmath144 one has @xmath145 where @xmath146 . comparing eqs . and",
    "we find that the eigenvalues @xmath147 are @xmath148 and the state is @xmath149 where we have defined @xmath150 which may be viewed as the overall effective efficiency of this measurement scheme .",
    "the remarkable feature of this method is the inequality @xmath151 which holds for any value of the quantum efficiencies .",
    "furthermore , the equality holds if and only if @xmath62 and in this case no squeezing is needed .",
    "this means that for @xmath152 the overall efficiency of this method is always greater than the one obtained by balancing the efficiencies by the insertion of an additional beam splitter .",
    "indeed , by multiplying both sides of by @xmath153 and after some algebra we see that is equivalent to @xmath154 which holds for all @xmath54 and @xmath155 .    in order to make our analysis more quantitative",
    "let us introduce the quantity @xmath156 which represents the ratio between the effective efficiency achievable by squeezing the parameter field at fixed value of the four efficiencies @xmath37 , @xmath157 and the corresponding quantity obtained by the insertion of a beam splitter . from eq .",
    "( [ comparison ] ) we know already that @xmath158 , whereas in fig .",
    "[ f : gm ] we report its behaviour as a function of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "( color online ) the ratio @xmath159 between the effective efficiency achievable by squeezing the parameter field and the corresponding quantity obtained by the insertion of a beam splitter as a function of @xmath54 and @xmath55 . ]",
    "as it is apparent from the plot @xmath159 is symmetric under the exchange of @xmath54 and @xmath55 and achieves its maximum @xmath160 for @xmath161 and @xmath162 or viceversa .",
    "the function is not particularly peaked around its maximum and this means that there is a wide range of values for @xmath54 and @xmath55 for which we have a significant gain in squeezing the parameter field in comparison to the insertion of a beam splitter .",
    "on the other hand , when one of the two efficiencies is very small then the two methods are equally ineffective .",
    "the amount of squeezing needed to achieve cpo strongly depends on the values of the efficiencies .",
    "the region of maximum improvement corresponds to a moderate squeezing , i.e. @xmath135 not too far from one . in fig .",
    "[ f : pargm ] we report the parametric plot of @xmath159 as a function of the corresponding squeezing : this is a multivalued plot since there are many pairs @xmath163 for which the same @xmath159 is achievable , though employing different amounts of squeezing .",
    "( color online ) parametric plot of the ratio @xmath159 between the effective efficiency achievable by squeezing the parameter field and the corresponding quantity obtained by the insertion of a beam splitter as a function of the squeezing @xmath135 needed to achieve the compensation . ]    the two symmetric maxima of fig .",
    "[ f : gm ] correspond to squeezing parameters which are inverses of each other , ( @xmath164 and @xmath165 ) i.e. they correspond to the same amount of squeezing , but in orthogonal directions . in turn ,",
    "when the values of the two efficiencies @xmath54 and @xmath55 are close to each other we have @xmath166 overall , we conclude that squeezing the parameter field is always convenient , and may lead to a considerable gain in the effective efficiency in comparison to the insertion of a beam splitter . since the maximum gain corresponds to the use of a moderate amount of squeezing we foresee possible experimental implementations with current technology .",
    "we close this section by comparing the phase distributions obtained by using these two methods of balancing the efficiencies .",
    "suppose , for simplicity , that the signal field is in a coherent state @xmath167 with @xmath168 and the overall efficiencies of the homodyne detectors are @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "the effective efficiency obtained by using the squeezing method is then @xmath169 .",
    "we show the phase distributions in fig .",
    "[ distributions ] where we have also added the ideal case for comparison .",
    "it is clear that the squeezing method provides a distribution which is more peaked around its maximum . to make this more precise ,",
    "consider the _ minimum variance _ of the distribution defined as @xcite @xmath170 let @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 be the phase distributions obtained with ideal detectors , squeezing , and by using an additional beam splitter .",
    "then the minimum variances are given by @xmath174 which clearly shows the advantage of the squeezing method .",
    "with @xmath175 in the case of ideal detectors ( higher dashed line ) , balancing by squeezing ( solid line ) , and balancing by an additional beam splitter ( lower dashed line ) . ]",
    "in this paper we have analyzed in detail the performance of the eight - port homodyne detector as a suitable device to measure covariant phase observables .",
    "we have abandoned the traditional assumption of equal quantum efficiencies for the four photodetectors involved in the detection scheme and have investigated in detail the conditions under which the measurement of a cpo may be achieved .",
    "we have found that balancing the efficiencies using an additional beam splitter allows to achieve cpo at the price of reducing the overall effective efficiency and we have proved that this cpo is never a smearing of the ideal cpo achievable with unit quantum efficiency . we have also suggested an alternative compensation strategy , where a squeezed vacuum is used as a parameter field , which allows one to increase the overall efficiency in comparison to the passive case using only a moderate amount of squeezing .    in ideal conditions ,",
    "i.e. for photodetectors with unit quantum efficiencies , the phase - space observables achievable by eight - port homodyning are equivalent to those achievable by six - port homodyning @xcite or heterodyning @xcite .",
    "equivalence also holds in noisy conditions if all the involved photodetectors are assumed to have the same quantum efficiency . in this context",
    "a question arises on whether the effects of different quantum efficiencies may result in different phase - space observables or in inequivalent compensation schemes .",
    "work along these lines is in progress and results will be reported elsewhere .",
    "our results provide a more realistic characterization of phase - space measurements of the optical phase by eight - port homodyning , and are suitable for experimental verification . as a matter of fact",
    ", both compensation schemes suggested in this paper may be implemented with current quantum optical technology .",

    "<S> we address measurements of covariant phase observables ( cpos ) by means of realistic eight - port homodyne detectors . </S>",
    "<S> we do not assume equal quantum efficiencies for the four photodetectors and investigate the conditions under which the measurement of a cpo may be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> we show that balancing the efficiencies using an additional beam splitter allows us to achieve a cpo at the price of reducing the overall effective efficiency , and prove that it is never a smearing of the ideal cpo achievable with unit quantum efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative strategy based on employing a squeezed vacuum as a parameter field is also suggested , which allows one to increase the overall efficiency in comparison to the passive case using only a moderate amount of squeezing . </S>",
    "<S> both methods are suitable for implementantion with current technology . </S>"
