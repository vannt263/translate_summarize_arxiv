    "a small fraction of active galactic nuclei  ( agns ) with broad lines show double - peaked emission - line profiles , which suggests an accretion disc origin @xcite . in a stationary circular",
    "relativistic disc model , doppler boosting will make the blue peak of the profile higher than the red one .",
    "however , observations of the variability of line emission in some objects show that at least at some epochs the profile asymmetry is reversed , with the red peak higher than the blue one , contrary to the predictions of homogeneous , circular relativistic disc models @xcite . to adjust the theoretical to the observed profiles , non - axisymmetric or warped discs",
    "are usually required .",
    "various physically plausible processes in the accretion flow have been considered , such as spiral shocks , eccentric discs , bipolar outflows or a binary black hole system @xcite , as well as a warped accretion disc @xcite .",
    "this warped disc makes it possible for the radiation from the inner disc to reach the outer parts , enhancing the reprocessing emission lines .",
    "thus , warping can both provide the asymmetry required for the variations of the emission lines and naturally solve the long - standing energy - budget problem , because the subtending angle of the outer disc portion to the inner one is increased by the warp .",
    "there are strong observational and theoretical grounds for believing that accretion discs around black holes may be warped and twisted .",
    "evidence for the existence of warped discs in astrophysical systems has been found from observations @xcite . from a theoretical point of view , four main mechanisms for exciting / maintaining warping in accretion discs have been proposed , namely warping that is tidally induced by a companion in a binary system @xcite , radiation - driven or self - induced warping @xcite , magnetically driven warping @xcite , or warping driven by frame dragging @xcite .",
    "note also that warps generated by gravitational interactions have been investigated in the literature . in the galactic context ,",
    "@xcite studied the linear bending waves of a self - gravitating , isolated , thin disc . on nuclear disc scales ,",
    "@xcite studied the evolution of a thin self - gravitating viscous disc interacting with a massive object orbiting the central black hole .",
    "@xcite showed that highly warped discs near black holes can persist for a long time without any persistent forcing other than by their self - gravity . as a result",
    ", the accretion disc in some agns may be non - planar .    to solve the energy budget for the emission - line region for the disc model , reprocessing of the ultraviolet(uv)/x - ray continuum from the inner accretion disc",
    "is required .",
    "however , only a very small fraction of radiation from the inner disc is expected to intercept the outer part of the disc in the case of a flat geometrically thin disc . two types of processes have been proposed to increase the fraction of light incident on the disc emission - line region .",
    "@xcite proposed that the inner part of the accretion disc is hot and becomes geometrically thick as a result of insufficient radiative cooling , and the x - ray emission from such an ion - supported torus is responsible for such energy input .",
    "however , double - peak emitters do not always have a low accretion rate @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xcite proposed that a slow - moving jet can scatter a substantial fraction of uv / x - ray light from the inner accretion disc back to the outer part of the disc .",
    "although this may be likely for radio - loud double - peaked emitters , the majority of double - peaked emitters are radio - quiet . in this work",
    ", we consider a system with an accretion disc around a kerr black hole .",
    "the black hole spin is misaligned with the outer parts of the disc , as there is no physical reason to suppose that the angular momentum of the accreting mass and the angular momentum of the spinning black hole are always aligned .",
    "frame dragging produced by a kerr black hole causes the precession of the orbit of a particle if its orbital plane is inclined with respect to the equatorial plane of the black hole .",
    "this is known as the lense - thirring effect .",
    "the combined action of the lense - thirring effect , which tends to twist up the disc , and the internal viscosity of the accretion disc , which tends to smooth it out , forces the alignment between the angular momenta of the kerr black hole and the accretion disc .",
    "this is known as the bardeen - petterson effect .",
    "this effect tends to affect the inner regions of the disc owing to the short range of the lense - thirring effect(@xmath3 ) , whereas the outer part of the disc tends to keep its original inclination .",
    "the transition radius between these two regimes is known as the bardeen - petterson radius @xmath4  ( or warp radius @xmath5 ) , and its exact location depends mainly on the physical properties of the accretion disc @xcite .",
    "basically , the bardeen - petterson radius is determined by comparing the time - scale related to the lense - thirring precession with that of warp propagation through the disc .",
    "we consider here the propagation of warps in thin keplerian discs in the case for which the disc is sufficiently viscous that the warp propagates in a diffusive manner .",
    "the twisted disc itself is treated using a non - relativistic approach with an additional term describing the gravitomagnetic precession of the disc rings .",
    "both analytic and numerical steady - state solutions have shown that the evolution of a misaligned disc arising from the bardeen - petterson effect usually produces an inner flat disc and a warped transition region with a smooth gradient in the tilt and twist angles @xcite . if the disc is thick and/or its viscosity is low , the warp propagates in a wave - like rather than a diffusive manner @xcite . in this case , the twisted disc is not necessarily aligned with the equatorial plane at small scales .",
    "the inclination angle of a low - viscosity disc may even oscillate or counteralign close to the black hole @xcite .",
    "the effect of a bardeen - petterson disc on iron line profiles treated relativistically has been examined by @xcite , and @xcite used a non - relativistic treatment to study the broad - line h@xmath6 profiles from a warped disc .",

    "<S> the broad balmer emission - line profiles resulting from the reprocessing of uv / x - ray radiation from a warped accretion disc induced by the bardeen - petterson effect are studied . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt a thin warped disc geometry and a central ring - like illuminating source in our model . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the steady - state shape of the warped disc numerically , and then use it in the calculation of the line profile . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , from the outer radius to the inner radius of the disc , the warp is twisted by an angle @xmath0 before being flattened efficiently into the equatorial plane . </S>",
    "<S> the profiles obtained depend weakly on the illuminating source radius in the range from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , but depend strongly on this radius when it approaches the marginally stable orbit of an extreme kerr black hole . </S>",
    "<S> double- or triplet - peaked line profiles are present in most cases when the illuminating source radius is low . </S>",
    "<S> the triplet - peaked line profiles observed from the sloan digital sky survey may be a  signature \" of a warped disc .    </S>",
