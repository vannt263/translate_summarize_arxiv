    "lacoo@xmath2 crystallizes in a rhombohedral symmetry ( r@xmath12c ) and has quite unusual physical properties . at low temperatures it features a nonmagnetic and insulating ground state . with increasing temperature",
    "a paramagnetic moment develops which causes a maximum in the susceptibility around 100k @xcite .",
    "this is usually explained in terms of a temperature - driven spin - state transition of the co@xmath8 ions which can occur in three different spin configurations : a low - spin ( ls ) ( @xmath13 , @xmath7 ) , an intermediate - spin ( is ) ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) , or a high - spin state ( hs ) ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) . at low temperatures a ls ground state is realized .",
    "the nature of the spin state at higher temperatures is controversially discussed , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the spin - state transition causes also a large additional schottky - like contribution to the thermal expansion of lacoo@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the substitution of la@xmath8 by an amount @xmath11 of divalent ca , sr , or ba ions influences this contribution and leads to a strong suppression of the spin - state transition .",
    "furthermore all doping series show long - range ferromagnetic order and metallic behavior at higher doping levels @xmath18 . in the case of ca doping ,",
    "ferromagnetic behavior is observed for the insulating compounds @xmath19 , too @xcite .",

    "[ tad ] the temperature dependence of the linear thermal - expansion coefficient @xmath26 of la@xmath0ca@xmath1coo@xmath2 is shown .",
    "[ tad](a ) clearly reveals that the pronounced maximum in the thermal - expansion data of the undoped compound ( @xmath4 ) is strongly suppressed with increasing doping concentration @xmath11 . above @xmath27 this indication of the spin - state transition",

    "instead several anomalies develop ( figs .",
    "[ tad](b )  ( d ) ) : the curves for @xmath28 exhibit two distinct minima and for @xmath29 additional kinks occur .",
    "the low - temperature minimum ( ltm ) shifts with increasing @xmath11 to lower whereas the high - temperature minimum ( htm ) moves to higher temperatures . for @xmath30 we could observe only the onset of the decrease in @xmath5 , because the anomaly has shifted out of the available temperature interval , i.e.  @xmath31k , for higher doping concentrations .     obtained from x - ray diffraction data of la@xmath32ca@xmath33coo@xmath2 :",
    "the arrows indicate whether the data was taken with increasing or decreasing temperature .",
    "the lines are to guide the eyes . ]    at room temperature a doping induced structural phase transition from rhombohedral ( r@xmath12c , @xmath34 ) to orthorhombic symmetry ( pbnm , @xmath35 ) is observed @xcite .",
    "this transition shifts to lower temperatures for smaller @xmath11 .",
    "[ roentg ] shows the temperature dependence of the structural phase fractions for @xmath36 which was obtained from x - ray diffraction data .",
    "it reveals a first - order phase transition .",
    "the htm for @xmath36 occurs at @xmath37k which coincides with the crossover from r@xmath12c to pbnm in the x - ray data .",
    "therefore the occurrence of the htm in @xmath5 can be attributed to a doping - induced structural phase transition . in fig .",

    "the critical temperatures @xmath25 of the magnetic transitions have been taken from the @xmath39 data given in ref .",

    "all compounds feature one or more weak anomalies in @xmath45 , which coincide with the anomalies in @xmath5 . for @xmath36 and 0.17",
    "the ltm and the magnetic phase transition occur at similar temperatures . in the @xmath5 data of the higher doped specimens",
    "the onset of ferromagnetism is indicated by kinks .",
    "these kinks might be hidden by the large ltm anomalies for @xmath36 and 0.17",
    ". therefore one can not distinguish if the anomalies in @xmath45 for these two compounds are caused by the magnetic or a different transition .",
    "for @xmath48 the specific - heat data features only a weak shoulder around the temperature of the corresponding ltm .",
    "the anomalies visible in the data of the higher doped compounds @xmath35 are clearly related to the ferromagnetic phase transition .",
    "the structural phase transition shifts with increasing @xmath11 to higher temperatures and causes in both quantities clear anomalies .",
    "the appearance of the htm in @xmath5 ( @xmath42 ) and of the maxima at higher temperatures in @xmath45 take place at similar temperatures . for @xmath49",

    "the origin of the ltm which is visible in @xmath5 is not clear yet .",
    "this anomaly vanishes for @xmath50 and possibly does not affect the specific heat .",
    "the investigation of its origin is still under progress and will be reported elsewhere .    in summary ,",
    "we have studied the influence of hole doping on the series la@xmath0ca@xmath1coo@xmath2 by thermal - expansion and specific - heat measurements .",
    "depending on the concentration @xmath11 we observe up to three distinct anomalies .",
    "one of them is related to the ferromagnetic ordering , while a second one arises from a first - order structural phase transition .",
    "the origin of the third anomaly remains to be clarified .",
