    "a magnetically driven ferroelectric response @xcite has been almost exclusively observed in incommensurate ( icm ) states with broken inversion symmetry , where non - centrosymmetric lattice distortions and ferroelectric order are induced through exchange - striction , @xcite inverse dzyaloshinskii - moriya @xcite or spin current @xcite mechanisms . since complex icm magnetic orderings without inversion symmetry",
    "are often provoked by magnetic frustration , resulting from competing exchange interactions on a lattice of localized spins , low - dimensional systems with triangular geometries are considered as prominent candidates for novel magnetoelectric materials .",
    "one of the synthesis strategies that has proved to be very successful in the search of such compounds , is to use lone - pair cations and mix them with a transition metal in the presence of halogen ions.@xcite this way it is very likely that the number of the superexchange pathways between the magnetic ions is reduced and a geometrically frustrated low - dimensional structure is formed . on the other hand ,",
    "lone - pair electrons were also recognized as carriers of the electric polarization in numerous ferroelectric materials , such as for instance bi@xmath7 in bimno@xmath8 .",
    "@xcite in fact , it is generally accepted that since lone - pair electrons are stereochemically active , they can be easily polarized .",
    "they are thus considered as a primary driving force behind the off - center structural distortions essential for the formation of electric polarization in magnetic materials . for these reasons , they seem to be convenient candidates to induce both , magnetic frustration as well as electric polarization , and may consequently lead to a strong coupling between magnetic and electric orders .",
    "this assumption has been proven correct by the discovery of the magnetoelectric coupling in fete@xmath0o@xmath1br,@xcite which is an exemplary product of the above research directives .",
    "this system has a crystal structure that implies both magnetic frustration and reduced dimensionality .",
    "it adopts a layered structure , where individual layers consist of geometrically frustrated iron tetramer units [ fe@xmath9o@xmath10@xmath11 coupled through the [ te@xmath9o@xmath12br@xmath0]@xmath14 groups.@xcite the negative curie - weiss temperature @xmath15 = @xmath1698k , determined from susceptibility measurements,@xcite implies strong antiferromagnetic ( afm ) interactions between the fe@xmath7 ( @xmath17 = 5/2 ) moments .",
    "the strongly suppressed nel temperature , @xmath18 10k , suggests that the exchange interactions are frustrated.@xcite our recent investigation @xcite revealed that at @xmath19 = 10.6(1)k the system undergoes a transition into an icm amplitude - modulated magnetic structure [ with magnetic wave vector @xmath20 = ( 1/2 0.463 0 ) ] , which is accompanied by a spontaneous electric polarization , pointing perpendicular to @xmath20 and to the magnetic moments .",
    "the ferroelectricity was ascribed to the polarization of the te@xmath21 lone - pair electrons , while the magnetoelectric effect was argued to be due to sliding of neighboring amplitude - modulated waves , which induces the exchange - striction of the fe - o - te - o - fe intercluster exchange bridges .",
    "we stress that although the novel icm amplitude - modulated structure in fete@xmath0o@xmath1br differs from helical and cycloidal magnetic orders typically found in other multiferroics with spin - order induced ferroelectricity , the coupling mechanism is still described with two complex magnetic order parameters .",
    "one of the fundamental questions is whether this similarity leads also to a similar phase diagram , i.e. , how does the applied magnetic field affect the ferroelectric properties , and vice versa , how the electric field affects the magnetic properties of the system with icm amplitude - modulated magnetic structure .",
    "a small value of the electric polarization , on one hand , and sizable fe@xmath7 magnetic moments on the other , imply that the magnetoelectric effect should be more easily induced by applying the magnetic field than the electric field .",
    "we therefore explored the magnetic phase diagram and the influence of the applied magnetic field on the magnetic and electric properties of the fete@xmath0o@xmath1br system .",
    "in particular , we were interested in seeing whether the external magnetic field can suppress or even switch the electric polarization .",
    "our detailed study includes a variety of complementary experimental techniques ; i.e. , specific heat , magnetic susceptibility , neutron diffraction , dielectric and thermal expansion measurements were performed down to 300mk and up to 9 t .    in this paper",
    "we show that short - range magnetic correlations within the crystal layers persist up to @xmath250k , while long - range magnetic ordering sets in at @xmath22 = 11.0(1)k , when the ht - icm phase is established . at @xmath4",

    "we first measured the temperature dependence of the specific heat in applied magnetic fields ( fig.[fig7]a ) .",
    "for this orientation of the sample , both transitions are very well resolved already in zero - field . with increasing magnetic field , both transitions simultaneously shift to higher temperatures , i.e. @xmath4 and @xmath22 shift from 10.5(1)k and 11.0(1)k at 0 t , to 11.1(1)k and 11.5(1)k at 9 t , respectively , keeping the width of the ht - icm temperature interval virtually unchanged .    to confirm these results , we performed magnetic susceptibility measurements ( fig.[fig7]b ) .",

    ")  for @xmath47 , both magnetic transition temperatures shift in parallel towards higher temperatures with increasing magnetic field , indicating that this orientation of the magnetic field is appreciated by the ht - icm as well as the lt - icm phases .",
    "let us now discuss the derived phase diagram and its relevance for the magnetoelectric properties of fete@xmath0o@xmath1br .",
    "we first focus on the ht - icm phase . in the magnetic field of 6 t applied along the @xmath26-axis ,",
    "the temperature interval of the ht - icm phase is broad enough to firmly state that the magnetic peak intensity @xmath85 in the ht - icm phase has a fundamentally different temperature dependence compared to the lt - icm phase .",
    "typically , the magnetic peak intensity @xmath85 is assumed to be proportional to the square of the magnetic moment,@xcite hence its temperature dependence is often described as @xmath86 . assuming this simple phenomenological model , we obtain @xmath87 0.27(1 ) for the lt - icm phase and @xmath87 0.34(2 ) for the ht - icm ( fits are shown as solid lines in fig.[fig2]a ) .",
    "the magnetic peak intensity in the ht - icm phase seems to be almost proportional to the temperature .",
    "a smaller critical exponent @xmath88 below @xmath4 as compared to that below @xmath22 , indicative of enhanced critical fluctuations at @xmath4 , is consistent with the behavior found in the thermal expansion and specific heat measurements .",
    "a comparison of the obtained @xmath88 s to the critical exponent values known for some typical universality classes @xcite implies that the ht - icm phase should be characterized as three - dimensional planar ( 3d xy ) or ising model , while the lt - icm phase rather corresponds to the two - dimensional planar ( 2d xy ) class .",
    "such a behavior is counterintuitive , as one would expect exactly the opposite ordering sequence . in fact",
    ", the temperature dependence of @xmath71 ( fig.[fig8]b ) indicates that in the ht - icm phase magnetic correlations between the crystal layers have a finite value , implying a more 2d nature of the phase . at the moment , this puzzle remains to be clarified .",
    "we point out though that the obtained @xmath88 s should be taken with care , giving only approximate values , which may deviate from the correct values for the critical exponent .",
    "namely , the exact expression for @xmath85 depends also on the phase shift and orientation of the magnetic moments , which might exhibit different temperature dependent behavior compared to their magnitudes .",
    "therefore a detailed knowledge about the temperature dependent sliding of the amplitude - modulated waves is required too . nevertheless",
    ", significantly different @xmath88 s in the ht - icm and lt - icm phases imply that the two magnetic orders , although being both incommensurate , are intrinsically different .",
    "most likely this is the key to understanding the absence of the ferroelectricity in the ht - icm phase .",
    "similar to the magnetic peak intensity , the magnetic peak positions in the lt - icm phase also exhibits critical behavior , i.e. , it can be described with the @xmath89 law , where @xmath900.35(1 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetic peak position in the ht - icm phase is temperature independent and seems to be locked at @xmath20 = 0.4665(3 ) ( fig.[fig2 ] ) . since the shift of the magnetic peak as well as the electric polarization",
    "are both observed only in the lt - icm phase , we suspect that they are somehow correlated .",
    "it is possible that the shift of the magnetic peak indicates the changes of the magnetic structure , which are essential for the development of the electric polarization and are very likely associated with the inversion symmetry breaking at @xmath4 .",
    "next we focus on the field dependence of the observed magnetic transition temperatures , which can be explained by considering the zeeman energy term in the free energy , @xmath91 .",
    "this term implies that in the external magnetic field the state with higher @xmath48 is favored .",
    "thus , in the case of a negative ( positive ) slope of @xmath40 over the magnetic transition , an increase ( decrease ) of the transition temperature with increasing magnetic field is anticipated .",
    "a close inspection of @xmath40 in the vicinity of the magnetic transitions supports the above argument : when @xmath47 , @xmath48 increases with decreasing temperature over both transitions ( fig.[fig7]b ) , which is reflected in the increase of @xmath22 as well as @xmath4 with field ; for @xmath5 , @xmath48 is decreasing during cooling ( inset of fig.[fig4]a ) , in agreement with the reduction of both transition temperatures ; finally , for @xmath34 , @xmath40 at @xmath22 is almost completely flat while it drops below @xmath4 ( fig.[fig1]b ) , which corroborates the decrease of @xmath4 , but does not say much about the behavior of @xmath22 .",
    "comparison of the explored phase diagram to those found in cycloidal and helical multiferroics with strong magnetoelectric coupling @xcite reveals that they share a common feature .",
    "they all exhibit at least two consecutive magnetic transitions , where only the second one is accompanied with the emergence of electric polarization .",
    "this reflects the invariance of the free energy under time reversal , which demands that the lowest magnetoelectric coupling term in multiferroics is trilinear , involving at least two magnetic order parameters .",
    "however , in contrast to cycloidal and helical structures , where both magnetic order parameters are typically associated with different components of sublattice magnetizations , in fete@xmath0o@xmath1br it seems that one of the magnetic order parameters is proportional to the amplitude of the modulation waves , while the second one is related to the phase difference between them .",
    "@xcite an additional difference is in the field dependence of the first magnetic transition ( at @xmath22 ) , which for @xmath34 and @xmath47 shifts to higher temperatures ( fig . [ fig11 ] ) , in contrast to the usual behavior , @xcite where the transition from the paramagnetic to the icm phase is unfavored by the external magnetic field and thus shifts to lower temperatures .",
    "the apparent differences between fete@xmath0o@xmath1br from cycloidal or helical systems may be responsible for the intriguing response to @xmath5 , when at @xmath24.5 t the electric polarization in the lt - icm disappears in parallel with the loss of the ht - icm phase , even though magnetic susceptibility and neutron diffraction experiments do not indicate a drastic change of the magnetic structure in the lt - icm phase .",
    "this unusual behavior can be explained by several different scenarios : ( i ) the magnetic structure of the lt - icm phase changes above 4.5 t , but the change is below our sensitivity , ( ii ) the applied magnetic field narrows the energy gap and allows the low - energy excitations , e.g. , phasons , to suppress the long - range ferroelectric ordering , ( iii ) ferroelectric domains are saturated by the external magnetic field , and consequently diminish the peak in the dielectric constant , ( iv ) the loss of the ht - icm phase is accompanied with an induced disorder of the ferroelectric state .",
    "further experiments are clearly needed to clarify this important issue .",
    "finally , we note that pronounced short - range ordering effects , which indicate low - dimensional magnetic ordering , do not promote the ferroelectricity and raise the multiferroic state as suggested in ref . .",
    "this is most likely due to the fact that magnetoelectric coupling is conditioned by the loss of inversion symmetry , which is broken only after long - range inversion asymmetric magnetic ordering is established .    to summarize , we have investigated the effect of an applied magnetic field on the magnetoelectric properties of the multiferroic fete@xmath0o@xmath1br system , i.e. , the detailed magnetic phase diagram for magnetic fields applied along all three crystal axes .",
    "the first sign of the short - range magnetic correlations within the crystal layers appears already at @xmath250k . at @xmath3 11.0(1)k",
    "the system undergoes a magnetic phase transition into the incommensurate ht - icm phase and 0.5k lower , at @xmath4 , the system undergoes a second phase transition into the incommensurate amplitude - modulated lt - icm phase accompanied by the spontaneous electric polarization.@xcite the complex sequence of transitions is similar to many cycloidal and helical structures.@xcite when a magnetic field is applied , the transition temperatures shift , i.e. , for @xmath34 , @xmath22 increases and @xmath4 decreases , whereas for @xmath47 , both magnetic transition temperatures shift in parallel towards higher temperatures . in case of @xmath5 and @xmath6 4.5 t , the ht - icm phase disappears along with the electric polarization otherwise present in the lt - icm phase .",
    "the discovery of the system s ability to turn - off the electric polarization when the external magnetic field of @xmath24.5 t is applied along the incommensurate direction is certainly the most prominent discovery in this system .",
