    "first , in order to combat the conductivity mismatch problem @xcite and realize efficient electrical spin injection and detection in graphene , a thin aluminium oxide layer has been introduced in between the ferromagnetic co injector / detector and graphene @xcite . yet , in some experiments the contact resistances are comparable in magnitude with the graphene square resistance over one spin relaxation length and significant spin relaxation occurs via the contacts .",
    "we quantify this effect by using an one dimensional spin diffusion model .",
    "second , in all our previous experiments the whole graphene layer was covered by the thin aluminum oxide layer , a procedure which simplified the fabrication process . whether this oxide layer , which needs to be only underneath the co electrodes , induces extra spin relaxation was not known . in order to investigate this issue we performed experiments where the aluminium oxide barriers were present only underneath the co electrodes .",
    "the third aspect is whether the low spin relaxation times are due to spin scattering at the edges of the graphene flakes .",

    "the precession curve is wider for a higher @xmath14 .",
    "this can be simply understood by the fact that for a higher @xmath14 ( i.e. a higher carrier mobility ) , a stronger magnetic field is required to induce 90@xmath40 precession since it takes less time for the spins to diffuse the fixed injector / detector distance .",
    "[ fig : thprec2]d ) shows wider precession curves for smaller spin relaxation times . for high relaxation times ,",
    "the shape of the curves is essentially the same .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that most of the injected spins do not relax before reaching the detector and the angle of precession is mainly determined by the time it takes them to arrive at the detector , i.e. the diffusion constant and the device length . for low spin relaxation times ,",
    "the spins following a long diffusive path have a high chance to relax before reaching the detector and , therefore , do not contribute to the measured signal . in this case , the spin signal is mainly determined by the spins following a short diffusive path , and which arrive faster at the detector ( effectively having a higher diffusion constant ) .",
    "the overall behavior is that , for given device characteristics and dimensions , the precession measurements allow accurate extraction of the spin transport properties provided that the contacts do not induce strong spin relaxation , i.e. the relaxation parameter @xmath44 is comparable or higher than the spin relaxation length .      in fig .",

    "this indicates that the longitudinal and transversal relaxation times ( t1 and t2 ) are similar for these devices @xcite .",
    "therefore , we argue that the precession measurements can be used to determine the spin transport properties ( @xmath15,@xmath23 ) of graphene . the advantage over the difficult to realize length dependence of the spin signal ( due to the irreproducibility of the contact resistances or the spin injection / detection efficiencies ) is obvious : the fabrication and proper characterization of a single device .    with increasing the perpendicular magnetic field above 0.5  t the magnetization of the co electrodes is slowly pulled out of plane . for fields above 1.25  t",
    "the relative orientation of the magnetization of the co electrodes is parallel ( both magnetizations are completely out of plane ) .",
    "now , the injected / detected spins are perpendicular to the two dimensional plane of the graphene layer and parallel to the external field ( no precession takes place ) .",
    "we observe that the spin signal is somewhat lower than the zero field signal , when the orientation of the injected / detected spins is parallel with the sample plane .",
