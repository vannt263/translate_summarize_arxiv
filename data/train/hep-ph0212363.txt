    "the pure - leptonic decays of heavy mesons are useful to determine the meson decay constants , and they are also sensitive to new physics beyond the standard model(sm ) @xcite .",
    "but it is well known that the decays of @xmath9 into light lepton pairs ( see , fig.1 ) are helicity suppressed by @xmath10 : @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the corresponding cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix element . in the case of @xmath13(@xmath14 )",

    "calculated these decays in perturbative qcd approach @xcite .",
    "they gave larger branching ratios . and",

    ", we will compare the result with some of the previous calculations@xcite .",
    "at last we will conclude the calculation briefly .",
    "we begin with the quark diagram calculation of @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "there are four charged particle lines in fig.1 , which correspond to four feynman diagrams contributing to the radiative decays @xmath21 ( @xmath1 ) at tree level , as shown in fig.2 .",
    "however when the photon line is attached to the internal charged line of w boson such as fig.2d , there is a suppression factor of @xmath23 .",
    "thus we neglect it for simplicity . to be consistent in the following calculation , we will always neglect the terms suppressed by the factor @xmath23 .",

    "thus we have @xmath25 we use further the interpolating field technique @xcite which relate the hadronic matrix elements to the decay constants of the mesons .",
    "the decay constant @xmath26 for a charged pseudoscalar meson is defined by @xcite : @xmath27 in the case of @xmath13 , we have @xmath28    the whole decay amplitude for @xmath3 ( @xmath22 ) is derived from eqs.([h4],[s2],[dd2 ] ) by neglecting the terms suppressed by @xmath29 , we drop the infrared divergence terms , which should be canceled by the radiative corrections of the pure leptonic decay @xmath30 @xcite . ]",

    "after our careful calculation , we conclude that the contribution of the feynman diagram where the photon is emitted from the initial light quark is dominant enough to neglect the other diagrams in the case of @xmath78 decay , but not for the case of @xmath79 or @xmath80 .",
    "it can be seen at table.1 that the contribution of the other two diagrams corresponding to fig.2b and 2c must be considered because the interference among the three feynman diagrams is large and destructive .",

    "in fact , the perturbative qcd approach @xcite is good for the b meson decays since the energy release is very large there , but may not be good for the lighter d meson decays .",
    "in addition , out result is consistent with that of @xcite within the light front quark model in the case of @xmath86 .",
