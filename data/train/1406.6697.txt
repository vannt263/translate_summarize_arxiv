    "the assembly and merging history of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) at the centers of massive galaxies appears to proceed in close connection with  and possibly even regulate  the growth of their host galactic bulges .",
    "perhaps the most well known incarnation of this is the `` @xmath5-@xmath3 '' relation , or the correlation between the mass @xmath5 of a smbh and the velocity dispersion @xmath3 of the bulge ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; see also @xcite for m-@xmath3 relation for active galactic nuclei ) .",
    "tight scaling relations have also been claimed between smbh mass and bulge mass / luminosity ( @xcite , @xcite ) . while the number of reliable dynamical measurements for black hole mass has grown by a factor of about 5 over the last decade or so",
    ", it remains unclear whether these power law scaling relations break down at the highest and lowest masses ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and whether classical vs. pseudo - bulges lead to different scaling relations ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "related to the above issues , the black hole mass function itself is largely unconstrained at low masses ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and its determination may in turn be biased by the assumption of a single power - law relation with log - normal scatter @xcite .",
    "based on detailed morphological analysis of a large sample of nearby early type galaxies spanning over four decades in stellar mass ( @xmath6 ) , @xcite proposed that , for galaxies with @xmath6 less than a few times @xmath7 , compact stellar nuclei  with half - light radii between 2 - 5 pc and about 20 times brighter than typical globular clusters @xcite  may take over from smbhs as the dominant form of mass aggregation in galactic nuclei ( a similar result has been reported for a comparably large sample of spiral galaxies by @xcite ) .",
    "most relevant to this paper , detailed work on the occurrence rate and properties of these  nuclear star clusters \" ( nscs ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) was carried out within the advanced camera for surveys virgo cluster survey ( acs vcs ; @xcite ) , consisting of dual - band _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) acs observations of 100 early - type galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "later augmented by the fornax cluster survey @xcite , the acs vcs showed that between 66% and 82% of early - type galaxies with absolute b - magnitude @xmath8 host nuclear star clusters , a much larger percentage than had been thought based on ground observations ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite confirmed that nscs preferentially reside in galaxies with @xmath9 mag , and found that there is a smooth transition from nuclear light deficit to nuclear light excess with decreasing galaxy luminosity . also using the acs vcs data",
    ", @xcite found that the masses of nscs correlate with the virial masses of their host spheroidal galaxies , and that this relation extends from the scaling relation between smbh masses and the bulge masses of their host galaxies , possibly indicating a common growth mechanism for nscs and smbhs , and perhaps a shared formation mechanism . a common scaling relation for nscs and smbhs",
    "was also found independently by @xcite .",
    "these results would be consistent with a scenario whereby smbhs are the dominant  perhaps sole  mode of nuclear mass aggregation at the center of bright massive galaxies , becoming progressively less common down the mass function and disappearing entirely at the faint end , to be replaced by nscs ( the existence of a common scaling relation for the smbhs and the nscs has been by challenged by @xcite and @xcite ) .    over the last few years , an increasing number of galaxies hosting both nscs and smbhs",
    "have been identified @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xcite took a somewhat different approach from previous studies by searching for active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in 176 galaxies that were previously known to contain nscs .",
    "based on their analysis , at least 10% of their sample  spanning a wide range in masses and hubble types  hosts both nscs and smbhs , strongly suggesting that galaxies harboring nscs `` have agn fractions consistent with the population of galaxies as a whole '' . in order to better understand the connection between these objects , as well as their respective formation mechanisms , it is desirable to undertake systematic studies that characterize both nscs and smbh activity over a sample that is unbiased with respect to nuclear properties .    with the goal of delivering the first unbiased census of low - level smbh activity in the local universe , the amuse - virgo ( agn multi - wavelength survey of early - type galaxies ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) survey acquired _ chandra x - ray telescope _ acis ( advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ) observations for all 100 early - type galaxies targeted by the acs vcs .",
    "as the survey was tailored to probe down to eddington scaled x - ray luminosities as low as log(@xmath10/@xmath11)@xmath12 , it provides a relatively inexpensive ( i.e. , compared to dynamical studies ) way to identify smbhs in formally ",
    "inactive \" nearby galactic nuclei . while , in the absence of a nsc , the issue of potential contamination to the nuclear x - ray signal from bright low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) can be addressed quantitatively based on the known shape and normalization of the x - ray luminosity function of lmxbs ( gilfanov 2004 ) , the presence of a nsc demands a more conservative treatment ( see gallo et al .",
    "2010 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "for the vcs sample , the combined chandra  and hst data indicate that between 24% and 34% of the targeted galaxies host a _ bona fide _ x - ray active smbh .",
    "the fraction of hybrid nuclei , hosting both a smbh and a nsc is estimated between 0.3% and 7% for @xmath6  below @xmath13@xmath1  and to be lower than 32% above it ( at the 95% confidence level ; @xcite ) .",
    "born as an extension of amuse - virgo , the amuse - field chandra  survey ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite on ulxs , miller et al .",
    "2014 , submitted ) was designed to deliver the first measurement of low - level smbh activity in a field environment .",
    "amuse - field targeted a volume - limited sample of 103 nearby field early types spanning over three orders of magnitude in host stellar mass ; analogous to the virgo sample , the field galaxies were selected based solely on optical properties as classified by hyperleda , to create a sample that is unbiased with respect to nuclear properties . for the field sample , 45% @xmath14 7% of targets",
    "were found to host an x - ray active smbh @xcite .",
    "however , this measurement relies on the assumption that the fraction of field objects hosting a nsc is the same as that found for the amuse - virgo targets .",
    "in order to properly compare the incidence of smbh activity as well as stellar nucleation as a function of host stellar mass for the field sample as well as for virgo , we acquired dual - band hst / acs observations for a subsample of the amuse - field galaxies .",
    "combined , the chandra / acis and hst / acs data of the virgo and field samples provide _ uniform _ multi - wavelength information on the frequency of smbhs and nscs in the local universe , across the mass spectrum and across environment . in this work , we report on the analysis of the acs observations of the field targets .",
    "we model the galaxies surface brightness profiles to determine what fraction host nscs , and compare our results to those from the virgo cluster .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes our sample , data reduction , and analysis .",
    "section 3 presents our results on the fraction of nucleated ( as in hosting a nsc ) , early - type field galaxies , and our comparison to the fraction found for the virgo cluster .",
    "section 4 discusses the implications of these results in the context of nsc formation models .",
    "the full amuse - field sample is comprised of 103 early - type galaxies .",
    "we refer the reader to section 2 of @xcite for a detailed description of the selection criteria . our hst program aimed at acquiring dual band images for the galaxies with detected nuclear x - ray emission from chandra  ( 52 out 103 objects ) . out of those ,",
    "8 already had archival hst data in both the f475w and f850lp filters .",
    "the remaining 44 targets were approved for a snapshot survey in cycle 19 ( pi : gallo , i d 12951 ) , and 17 of them were eventually observed , with 340.0 s and 340.0@xmath1560.0 s exposures for the f475w and f850lp filters , respectively ( the completion rate was close to 40% , in line with the average value for hst snapshot programs ) . for the purpose of estimating the nucleation fraction  regardless of the nuclear x - ray properties  we included 3 additional objects from the amuse - field sample with no x - ray detection , but for which acs data in the same filters was also available in the archive . to summarize , here we report on hst / acs observations in the f475w & f850lp filters for 28 ( 17 new , plus 11 archival ) out of the 103 amuse - field galaxies ; 25 out of those 28 belong to the subsample of 52 galaxies with x - ray detected nuclei .",
    "data was re - reduced using the astrodrizzle pipeline to improve the point spread function sampling from 005/pixel to 003/pixel for all objects . though all objects were originally classified as early - type in hyperleda , three objects ( eso 540 - 014 , ngc 0855 , ngc 3265 ) revealed irregular or non - early type morphology in the acs images , and were thus excluded from further analysis .",
    "we refer to the appendix for descriptions of individual objects .",
    "we corrected for extinction within our galaxy using the extinction maps by @xcite .",
    "additionally , seven objects ( ngc 1172 , ngc 1370 , ngc 3073 , ngc 3377 , ngc 4036 , ngc 4125 , and ngc 4278 ) were identified as suffering from dust contamination through visual inspection .",
    "we corrected for dust following the procedure defined in @xcite , which relies on interpolation across dust affected areas .",
    "masses for both galaxies and nscs were computed using the mass - to - light relations for sloan _",
    "g _ and _ z _ bands defined in table 7 of appendix a of @xcite . in calculating masses ,",
