    "the mean - field ( mf ) or hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation gives a good description of the bulk properties of nuclei if phenomenological nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath5 ) forces are used , but employing realistic @xmath5 interactions it fails badly .",
    "the failure is a consequence of the strong and repulsive short - range components of a realistic @xmath5 interaction .",
    "thus , a careful evaluation of the short - range correlations ( src ) , produced by the short - range components of the @xmath5 interaction , is needed to describe the nuclear properties in terms of a realistic @xmath5 interaction and provide profound insight into the structure of the hadronic interaction in a nucleus .",
    "the same is true for the tensor correlations ( tc ) , which are induced by the strong tensor components of the @xmath5 interaction .",

    "various theoretical methods have been developed to account for such correlation effects ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . besides developing these methods ,",
    "it has always been a challenge for nuclear physics to envisage experimental situations and observables , particularly sensitive to correlations , whose determination can give clear evidence for correlations , in particular for src .",

    "only a small contribution is expected from two - body currents in ( @xmath1 ) @xcite . a proper treatment of the c.m .",
    "motion leads to an enhancement of the extracted s.f . by about 7% @xcite .",
    "a further enhancement is obtained in relativistic dwia ( rdwia ) analyses with relativistic optical potentials @xcite .",

    "it is anyhow important to check the relevance of relativistic effects also in the kinematics at lower energies of the previous experiments , whose data were analyzed with a nonrelativistic dwia treatment .",
    "relativistic effects as well as the differences between relativistic and nonrelativistic calculations have been investigated in different papers where rdwia treatments have been developed .",
    "the differences , however , are usually evaluated starting from the basis of a relativistic model where terms corresponding to relativistic effects are cancelled or where nonrelativistic approximations are included .",
    "although very interesting , these investigations do not correspond to the result of a comparison between rdwia and the dwia calculations carried out with the program dweepy .",
    "in fact , dweepy is based on a nonrelativistic treatment where some relativistic corrections are introduced in the kinematics and in the nuclear current operator . on the other hand",
    ", only indirect comparison between relativistic and nonrelativistic calculations can be obtained from the available data analyses carried out with dweepy and in rdwia .",
    "in fact , the two types of calculations make generally use of different optical potentials and bound state wave functions , and the difference due to the different theoretical ingredients can not be attributed to relativity .    in order to investigate the relevance of genuine relativistic effects through a direct comparison between rdwia calculations and the results of dweepy ,",
    "a fully relativistic rdwia model for the ( @xmath1 ) reaction has been developed and its numerical results have been compared with the corresponding results given by dweepy @xcite . in order to make the comparison as consistent as possible , in the nonrelativistic calculations the bound state is the normalized upper component of the dirac spinor and the scattering state is the solution of the same schrdinger - equivalent optical potential of the relativistic calculation .",

    "[ fig : fig3 ] , for the @xmath0o(@xmath1 ) reaction in comparison with the nikhef data @xcite . only small differences are found between the two calculations in this kinematics .",
    "the reduction ( spectroscopic ) factor applied to the calculated reduced cross sections in order to reproduce the size of the experimental results is 0.7 for rdwia and 0.65 for dwia , for both the transitions , which confirms that somewhat higher spectroscopic factors are obtained in rdwia .",
    "the systematic investigation carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite indicates that relativistic effects increase with the energy and in particular with the energy of the outgoing proton .",
    "the dwia approach can be used with enough confidence at the energies around 100 mev of previous ( @xmath1 ) experiments , and , with some caution , up to about 200 mev .",
    "this confirms the validity of the analyses carried out with dweepy at lower energies .",
    "a fully relativistic calculation is anyhow convenient at 200 mev and necessary above 300  mev .",

    "the depletion found in the dwia analyses is @xmath52% .",
    "are usually extracted from the comparison between data and dwia results and can be affected by all the uncertainties of the model .",
    "theoretical investigations within different correlation methods indicate that only a few percent of the depletion is due to src ( see also @xcite ) . when tc are added to src the depletion amounts to @xmath53% , at most @xmath54% in heavy nuclei .",
    "further depletion is given by lrc .",
    "a full and consistent calculation of the of and of the s.f .",
    "including src , tc and lrc is still unavailable .",
    "if we want to study more specifically src , we have seen that they account for only a small part of the depletion of the quasi - hole states .",
    "this depletion is compensated by the admixture of high - momentum components in the nuclear wave function .",
    "thus , one might think to investigate src studying the high - momentum components of the s.p .",
    "wave functions in exclusive one nucleon knockout experiments .",
    "indeed we have found large differences for the cross sections calculated with the different of at high values of the missing momentum .",
    "it is not clear , however , if these differences are due to correlations or to the different methods used in the calculations of the obdm .",
    "microscopic calculations of the momentum distribution @xcite give indeed a strong enhancement of the high - momentum components due to src , but this enhancement shows up at large values of @xmath9 . in exclusive ( @xmath1 ) experiments one does not measure the whole momentum distribution , but the spectral function at the energy corresponding to the specific final state that is considered .",
    "in general low - lying discrete states of the residual nucleus are considered , corresponding to low values of the energy , while the missing strength due to src is found at high values of the momentum but also at large values of the excitation energy , well above the continuum threshold , where other competing processes are present .",
    "this makes a clear - cut identification of src in ( @xmath1 ) very difficult .",
    "this identification appears possible in two - nucleon knockout reactions . here",
    "particular situations can be envisaged where the knockout of the two nucleons is entirely due to correlations .",
    "these situations appear very well suited to study src .",
    "since a long time electromagnetically induced two - nucleon knockout reactions have been devised as the preferential tool for investigating src .",
    "in fact , direct insight into src can be obtained from the situation where the electromagnetic probe hits , through a one - body current , either nucleon of a correlated pair and both nucleons are then ejected from the nucleus .",
    "this process is entirely due to correlations .",
    "but two nucleons can also and naturally be ejected by two - body currents due to meson exchanges and @xmath55 isobar excitations .",
    "these two competing processes , both produced by the exchange of mesons between nucleons , require a careful and consistent treatment . their role and relevance , however , is different in different reactions and kinematics .",
    "it is thus possible , with the help of theoretical predictions , to envisage appropriate situations where various specific effects can be disentangled and separately investigated .",
    "interesting and complementary information is available from electron and photon - induced reactions , but the electron probe is preferable to study src .",
    "in fact , two - body currents predominantly contribute to the transverse components of the nuclear response .",
    "only these components are present in photon - induced reactions that appear thus generally dominated by two - body currents .",
    "also the longitudinal component , dominated by correlations , is present in electron - induced reactions .",
    "the possibility of independently varying the energy and momentum transfer of the exchanged virtual photon allows one to select kinematics where the longitudinal response and thus src are dominant .",
    "a combined study of @xmath56 and @xmath57 knockout is needed for a complete information .",
    "correlations are different in @xmath56 and @xmath57 pairs .",
    "they are stronger in @xmath57 pairs and thus in @xmath57 knockout due to the tensor force , that is predominantly present in the wave function of a @xmath57 pair .",
    "but also two - body currents are much more important in @xmath57 knockout , while they are strongly suppressed in @xmath56 knockout , where the charge - exchange terms of the two - body current do not contribute .",
    "therefore , the ( @xmath3 ) reaction was devised as the preferential process for studying src in nuclei .",
    "it is however clear that , since different effects can be emphasized in suitable conditions for different reactions , a combined study of @xmath56 and @xmath57 knockout induced by real and virtual photons is needed to unravel the different contributions and obtain clear and complete information on @xmath5 correlations .",
    "exclusive reactions , for transitions to specific discrete eigenstates of the residual nucleus , are of particular interest for this study .",
    "one of the main results of the theoretical investigation is the selectivity of exclusive reactions involving different final states that can be differently affected by one - body and two - body currents @xcite .",
    "thus , the experimental resolution of specific final states may act as a filter to disentangle the two reaction processes .",
    "@xmath0o is a suitable target for this study , due to the presence of discrete low - lying states in the experimental spectrum of @xmath4c and @xmath4n well separated in energy . from this point of view , @xmath0o is better than a light nucleus , which lacks specific final states .",

    "a two - step procedure has been applied in this calculation where lrc and src are treated in a separate but consistent way .",
    "the calculation of lrc is performed in a sm space large enough to incorporate the corresponding collective features which influence the pair removal amplitudes .",
    "propagators used for this dressed random phase approximation ( rpa ) description of the two - particle propagator also include the effect of both lrc and src .",
    "this yields s.f . for low - lying states of @xmath2n which represent the closest agreement with ( @xmath1 ) data to date @xcite . in the second step that part of the pair removal amplitudes which describes the relative motion of the pair",
    "is supplemented by defect functions obtained from the same g - matrix which is also used as the effective interaction in the rpa calculation .",
    "the two - nucleon of for a discrete final state of @xmath4c , with angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath62 , is expressed in terms of a combination of relative and c.m .",
    "wave functions @xcite .",
    "the combination coefficients contain contributions from a sm space which includes the @xmath63 up to the @xmath64 shells .",

[ [ evidence - for - src - in - the-16oeepp14c - reaction ] ] evidence for src in the @xmath0o(@xmath3)@xmath4c reaction ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    a numerical example is shown in fig .

    "results are shown for two kinematical settings considered in the experiments performed at nikhef @xcite and mami @xcite .",
    "different components of relative and c.m .",

    "the value of @xmath77 determines the shape of the recoil - momentum distribution . indeed in fig .  4 for the @xmath67 state , where only components with @xmath76 are present",
    ", the momentum distributions have a typical @xmath37-wave shape , while the @xmath78-wave shape obtained for the @xmath66 state indicates that in the two considered kinematics the cross section is dominated by the component with @xmath72 and thus by @xmath68 @xmath56 knockout .",
    "the component with @xmath76 , due to @xmath69 , becomes meaningful only at large values of @xmath79 , where the contribution of the @xmath78 wave gets lower .",
    "the comparison between correlated and uncorrelated relative wave functions @xcite indicates that src play a different role in different relative states : they are quite strong for the @xmath68 state and much weaker for @xmath80 states . moreover , also",
    "the role of the isobar current is strongly reduced for @xmath68 @xmath56 knockout , since there the generally dominant contribution of that current , due to the magnetic dipole @xmath81 transition , is suppressed @xcite .",
    "thus , the role of src is emphasized in @xmath68 knockout , while the role of the @xmath55 current is emphasized in @xmath80 knockout .",
    "this explains the different role of the two reaction processes for the two final states in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] : the transition to the @xmath67 state is dominated by the two - body current , while for the @xmath66 state , where @xmath68 @xmath56 knockout plays the main role , the cross section is dominated by the one - body current and thus my src .",
    "the final result is determined by all the ingredients of the model , but it is clear that the two reaction processes play a different role for the two final states .",
    "thus , the experimental resolution of different states may act as a filter to disentangle and separately investigate the contributions due to src and two - body currents .",
    "data have confirmed the predictions of this model . a reasonable and in some cases an excellent agreement with the available data",
    "@xcite has been obtained .",
    "the comparison has clearly shown the validity of the dko mechanism for transitions leading to the lowest - lying states of @xmath4c and has confirmed the predicted selectivity of the exclusive reaction involving discrete final states , which are differently affected by src and two - body currents . in particular ,",
    "clear evidence for src has been obtained for the transition to the ground state @xcite .",
    "this important result means that two - nucleon knockout reactions can be used to study and hopefully determine src .",
    "more theoretical and experimental work is however needed for this study .",
    "more data are expected from mami for all the exclusive @xmath0o(@xmath3)@xmath4c , @xmath0o(@xmath82)@xmath4n , @xmath0o(@xmath83)@xmath4c , and @xmath0o(@xmath84)@xmath4n knockout reactions @xcite .",
    "a combined study of different reactions is needed for a complete information on @xmath5 correlations .",
    "good opportunities to increase the richness of information available from two - nucleon knockout reactions are also offered by polarization measurements @xcite .",
    "reactions with polarized particles give access to a larger number of observables , hidden in the unpolarized case , whose determination can impose more severe constraints on theoretical models .",
