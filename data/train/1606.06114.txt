    "their proof is based on elaborate use of the ( nowadays standard ) discharging technique . however , it is unlikely that the same method can be pushed further when directed 4-cycles are allowed .    the main result of this note is the following theorem whose proof is based on a novel technique , at least when colourings of graphs are concerned .",

    "a version used in this paper is taken from @xcite .",

    "the only detail to verify is that the combined colouring does not produce a monochromatic cycle .",
    "since the colourings of @xmath0 and @xmath21 have no monochromatic cycles , such a directed cycle @xmath15 would be composed of @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) directed paths @xmath27 , where each @xmath28 is a directed path completely contained in either @xmath0 or @xmath21 ( joining vertices @xmath29 and @xmath30 in @xmath22 ( @xmath31 , indices taken modulo @xmath32 ) . since none of these paths together with the arcs of the tournament on @xmath22 forms a directed cycle",
    ", @xmath22 contains the arcs @xmath33 , which all together form a monochromatic directed cycle in @xmath22 and hence in both @xmath0 and @xmath21 .",
    "this contradiction completes the proof .",
    "[ lem : outer triangle colouring extend ] let @xmath8 be a triangulation of the plane with the outer face bounded by a triangle @xmath34 .",
    "then for any orientation @xmath0 of @xmath8 with digirth at least @xmath7 and any precolouring of @xmath22 with colours @xmath35 and @xmath1 , there exists a @xmath1-colouring of @xmath0 that extends the precolouring on @xmath22 .",
    "the proof is by induction , with the base of induction corresponding to the case when the triangulation is 4-connected .",
    "we consider the dual graph @xmath9 of @xmath8 .",
    "note that @xmath9 is a cubic graph and that it is cyclically 4-edge - connected , i.e. , any 3-edge - cut in @xmath9 isolates a single vertex from the rest of the graph .",
    "we distinguish two cases , depending on whether the precolouring on @xmath22 uses just one or both colours ( see figure  [ fig:4connected precolouring ] ) .",
    "suppose first that not all vertices of @xmath22 are precoloured the same .",
    "we may assume that @xmath38 is coloured 1 and that @xmath39 are coloured 2 .",
    "let us denote the vertices of @xmath9 corresponding to @xmath22 and to the faces surrounding @xmath22 by @xmath40 , where the face @xmath41 of @xmath8 contains vertices @xmath39 but not @xmath38 , etc .",
    "let @xmath42 be a tutte path in @xmath9 with respect to the facial cycle of @xmath9 containing @xmath43 ( i.e. , the face dual to the vertex @xmath38 ) that connects @xmath44 and @xmath45 and passes through the edge @xmath46 .",
    "this path , whose existence follows from theorem [ thm : tutte path ] , together with the edge @xmath47 forms a cycle @xmath48 in @xmath9 .",
    "the cycle crosses the edges @xmath49 and @xmath50 of @xmath22 .",
    "we may assume that the exterior of @xmath48 contains @xmath51 and @xmath52 , while @xmath38 is in its interior .",
    "now we colour the vertices of @xmath0 in the interior of the cycle by using colour 1 , and those in the exterior by 2 .",
    "we claim that the above gives a 2-colouring of @xmath0 . to see this ,",
    "assume that the process gives rise to a monochromatic directed cycle @xmath53 .",
    "then we may assume that the whole cycle @xmath53 lies in the interior of @xmath48 .",
    "since this is also a cycle in @xmath8 , its interior contains a vertex of @xmath9 , but since @xmath48 is a tutte path , any such cycle separates a @xmath48-component with at most 3 attachments .",
    "since @xmath8 is 4-connected , this corresponds to a vertex in @xmath9 and the cycle @xmath53 is a triangle . but @xmath0 has digirth at least 4 , so @xmath53 is not a directed cycle .",
    "this contradiction proves the claim .",
    "suppose now that all three vertices of @xmath22 have the same colour .",
    "in this case we proceed in the similar way except that we consider the graph @xmath9 obtained from the dual of @xmath8 by deleting the vertex @xmath44 .",
    "the resulting graph is 2-connected and vertices @xmath54 all lie on the outer facial cycle @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath19 be a neighbor of @xmath41 on @xmath48 and @xmath55 a neighbor of @xmath56 in @xmath48 .",
    "now we take a tutte path with respect to @xmath48 from @xmath41 to @xmath19 that passes through the edge @xmath57 .",
    "together with the edge @xmath58 we obtain a cycle @xmath53 , and we colour the vertices of @xmath0 inside this cycle differently from the colour used on @xmath37 ; and the vertices outside this cycle the same as @xmath37 .",
    "the above gives an extension of the colouring of @xmath22 , as desired .",
    "we only need to argue that there are no monochromatic directed cycles of @xmath0 . as before ,",
    "the cycles of @xmath8 that are monochromatic are triangles that are dual to vertices in 3-attached @xmath53-components .",
    "all of these correspond to facial triangles in @xmath8 that are not directed cycles in @xmath0 by the assumption on the digirth .",
    "the only possible difference from the first case might be an @xmath53-component containing the vertex @xmath45 ( when @xmath59 ) . by property ( ii ) of tutte cycles , this @xmath53-component in @xmath9 is 2-attached .",
    "but in the dual graph of @xmath8 , it is adjacent to @xmath44 and thus gives a monochromatic subgraph of @xmath0 that contains @xmath37 and the vertex @xmath60 forming the second facial triangle with the edge @xmath49 of @xmath8 .",
    "however , since all edges incident with @xmath41 and @xmath56 are in @xmath53 , this subgraph only consists of four vertices .",
    "the two triangles in this subgraph are not directed cycles in @xmath0 , which implies that also the 4-cycle in this subgraph can not be a directed cycle .",
    "this shows that @xmath0 has no monochromatic directed cycles .",
    "if @xmath8 is not 4-connected , then there is a triangle @xmath61 that separates the graph , one component being the subgraph @xmath62 in the exterior of @xmath63 ( including @xmath63 , which now becomes a facial triangle ) and the other one , @xmath64 , formed from @xmath63 and the vertices and edges in the interior of @xmath63 .",
    "now we first extend the precolouring of @xmath22 to @xmath62 ( by using the induction hypothesis ) , and then apply the induction hypothesis to @xmath64 to extend the colouring of @xmath63 obtained in the first step . by lemma [ lem : combining a colouring for clique sum ] ,",
    "the combined colouring is a 2-colouring of @xmath0 .",
    "we may assume the underlying undirected graph @xmath8 is triangulated as otherwise , we can add a vertex inside each face of @xmath0 adjacent to all vertices of that face in @xmath8 and direct all edges towards the new vertices in @xmath0 .",
    "this creates no new directed cycles .",
    "the proof is now essentially the same as the proof of lemma [ lem : outer triangle colouring extend ] with one difference the we will explain below . if @xmath8 has a separating triangle , the induction step is the same as in lemma [ lem : outer triangle colouring extend ] ( by applying either the lemma or this theorem inductively ) .",
    "so , it suffices to consider the 4-connected case , and we are not bound with any precolouring .",
    "the faces of @xmath8 containing @xmath5 form a cycle @xmath48 in the dual graph @xmath65 .",
    "let us choose three consecutive vertices @xmath66 on @xmath48 . a tutte path with respect to @xmath48 joining @xmath67 and @xmath68 and containing the edge @xmath69 forms a cycle @xmath53 together with the edge @xmath70 .",
    "by the connectivity of @xmath65 , each @xmath53-component with two attachments is an edge .",
    "so all edges of @xmath48 are either an edge of @xmath48 or an entire @xmath17-component by property ( ii ) of tutte paths . in particular",
    ", no vertex of @xmath48 is in a 3-attached @xmath53-component and hence their duals , triangles containing @xmath5 , all have a vertex inside @xmath53 and a vertex outside @xmath53 .",
    "thus , using colour 1 for all vertices inside @xmath53 and using colour 2 outside @xmath53 gives an acyclic colouring of @xmath0 ."
