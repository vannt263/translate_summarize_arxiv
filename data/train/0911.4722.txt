    "in recent years , the study of various types of topological order in condensed matter physics has dramatically increased.@xcite the interest in this topic has been driven in large part by the fractional quantum hall effect , and efforts to understand the high temperature superconductors . in both cases",
    "electron interactions are fundamental to the phenomena .",
    "however , a new class of systems , non - interacting @xmath0 topological band insulators ( tbi ) with time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) , has diverted attention to topological properties that do not depend on interactions ( but are robust to weak interactions).@xcite the existence of topological properties in models that can be exactly solved in the non - interacting limit , and treated to a high degree of accuracy by conventional band theory methods in the interacting limit , has led to precise predictions for experiment.@xcite an unusually rapid verification of many of these predictions in experiment has followed , and there are now several known examples of this state of matter in both two dimensional @xcite and three dimensional systems@xcite . in some of these materials ,",
    "topological properties are expected to be robust up to room temperature and therefore hold great promise as components of future electronic devices.@xcite    current theoretical research on topological insulators is proceeding along several parallel tracks . on the one hand , there is great interest in identifying new physical systems that will possess topologically non - trivial phases@xcite , while on the other hand there are fundamental questions about the fate of topological properties as the strong electron interaction limit is approached@xcite . in this work , we contribute to both directions by providing several other examples of @xmath0 tbis on a lattice where they have not been reported before  the decorated honeycomb lattice .",
    "we also establish a topological connection at 1/2 filling between the non - interacting limit and the strongly interacting limit where an exactly solvable electron model ( the kitaev spin model ) is realized on the same lattice.@xcite we are unaware of any other model that realizes exactly solvable states at weak and strong interaction , both with topological properties .",
    "moreover , via explicit calculation , we show these two limits share topological properties , even though their symmetries are very different .",
    "our discussion focuses on a tight - binding model of fermions hopping on the 2-dimensional decorated honeycomb lattice shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] .",
    "this lattice is a  cousin \" of both the honeycomb lattice and the kagome lattice , each of which is known to support tbi phases .",
    "@xcite in a certain regard , the decorated honeycomb lattice can be viewed as an  interpolating \" lattice between the honeycomb and the kagome : if one shrinks the triangles at the verticies of the _ underlying _ honeycomb lattice ( sites with hopping parameter @xmath2 in the figure ) to their center point , the honeycomb lattice is recovered , while expanding the triangles until their corners touch produces the kagome lattice .",
    "one might consider this geometrical property to be the key reason the decorated honeycomb lattice supports topological insulator phases , given that the honeycomb and kagome lattices also support topological phases .",
    "however , because the unit cell of the decorated honeycomb lattice contains 6 sites ( compared to 3 for the kagome and 2 for the honeycomb ) its phase diagram is much richer than that of either of its  cousins \" and some novel features appear that we will discuss in more detail below .",
    "the hamiltonian for our ( initially non - interacting ) problem is @xmath3 the nearest - neighbor hopping is described by @xmath4 with amplitude @xmath2 on the triangles  @xmath5 \" and with amplitude @xmath6 between triangles  @xmath7 \" , as shown in fig .",

    "the 6 ( doubly degenerate ) bands coming from the 6-site unit cell ( see fig .",

    "we note that the lower qbcp appears at filling fraction @xmath29 for @xmath30 and at @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "similar band features are also found on the kagome lattice at the same brillouin zone points.@xcite when the second neighbor hopping @xmath33 , a gap opens at the dirac and the qbcp and topologically non - trivial phases appear ; denoted as quantum spin hall ( qsh ) insulator in figs .",

    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] .",
    "one feature of the decorated honeycomb lattice that differs from the kagome and honeycomb lattices is the natural presence of two ( @xmath2 and @xmath6 ) , rather than one , nearest - neighbor hopping parameters .",
    "this effectively adds an additional degree of freedom to the phase diagram and can lead to transitions to topologically non - trivial phases even when there is not an _ obvious _ dirac point or quadratic band crossing involved in the nearest - neighbor hopping model , such as occur at filling fraction 1/3 in fig .",
    "[ fig : band_structure](a ) . as fig .",
    "[ fig : band_structure](b ) shows , when @xmath35 is turned on , an  incipient \" band touching point develops at the @xmath27 point for filling fraction 1/3 and this effectively drives the transition to the topologically non - trivial state .",
    "thus , the band structures with zero spin - orbit coupling do not always clearly reveal potential topological transitions for strong spin - orbit coupling .    at @xmath36 , and @xmath37 there are ( electron - hole compensated ) intervening metallic phases between topologically trivial and non - trivial insulators .",
    "this also indicates that a  direct \" transition coming from a band inversion is not generic in this model.@xcite the filling fractions with such an intervening metallic phase mimic the behavior of disorder on the honeycomb lattice in the presence of finite rashba coupling.@xcite also note that varying the ratio of @xmath38 at fixed @xmath35 can lead to a transition between a tbi and a trivial insulator .",
    "more surprisingly , increasing @xmath35 for fixed value of @xmath38 can trigger a transition between a tbi and a trivial insulator , as seen for @xmath31 and @xmath39 .",
    "next we turn to an analysis of the stability of the topological phases indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] in the presence of rashba interaction and on - site ( cdw ) potentials . the stability of the topological phases at @xmath40 and @xmath29 is shown in fig .

    "[ fig : lattice ] .",
    "consequently , the stability regions are qualitatively similar to the analagous model on the honeycomb lattice.@xcite the stability region of the qbcp at @xmath43 is larger than that for the dirac point at @xmath44 , which we attribute to a larger value of the gap ( @xmath453 times ) at the qbcp when @xmath46.@xcite",
    "at the dirac points it is straightforward to derive an effective low energy description for arbitrary @xmath19 in the 6-site unit cell .",
    "setting the zero of energy to be right at the dirac point ( either at @xmath40 or @xmath47 ) for @xmath48 , the effective low - energy hamiltonian is given by @xmath49 with @xmath50 we have adopted a @xmath51 notation similar to ref .  [ ] : the @xmath52 describes states at either the @xmath25 or @xmath26 points , the @xmath53 describes the two bands that are involved in the dirac band crossing ( analog of a and b sublattice bands on the honeycomb lattice ) , and @xmath10 represents the electron spin as it did in eq .",
    "and eq .  .",
    "the parameter @xmath54 refers to the dirac point at @xmath40 , and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "we have also defined two functions describing the dependence of the effective low - energy theory on the parameter @xmath55 : @xmath56 the effective fermi velocity entering eq .",
    "is @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the length of the unit cell vector .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "that for @xmath60 the spin - orbit coupling opens up a gap with magnitude @xmath61 .",
    "the parameters entering the low - energy description of the cdw term , eq .  , are given by @xmath62 a finite @xmath63 can be absorbed in a shift of the chemical potential .",
    "it is useful to consider a few important limits of the general low - energy form of @xmath15 .",
    "first take @xmath64 for sites on the a - triangle and @xmath65 for sites on the b - triangle .",
    "in this case , @xmath66 which is identical to the form of the expression for the honeycomb lattice and will generically open a gap at the dirac point.@xcite we have verified that the low - energy description given above produces the same stability phase diagram and phase boundary shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : band_structure](d ) as a direct diagonalization of the full 6-band hamiltonian .",
    "another important limit to consider is that of general @xmath19 . in that case",
    ", the physics more closely resembles the kagome lattice where an effective axial gauge field appears @xcite with @xmath67 when @xmath68 , where @xmath69 refers to the two dirac points @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath70 a gap @xmath71 opens with a smallest direct gap at shift @xmath72 with respect to @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the behavior of the decorated honeycomb lattice with respect to @xmath15 is another example of the ways in which this lattice  interpolates \" between the honeycomb and kagome lattices , and we expect , for example , analogs of the kekule phase to be realized as well.@xcite",
    "we now turn our attention to one of the features of the decorated honeycomb lattice which is related to its geometry : topological phases exist _ even in the absence of second neighbor hopping _ when @xmath2 is made complex ( obtained by putting a flux through the vertex triangles ) .",
    "below we show by an explicit calculation for spinless fermions that the model obtained in the absence of second neighbor hopping but with complex @xmath2 ( and possibly also complex @xmath6 ) can be adiabatically deformed into a model with real @xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath35 .",
    "an example of such an adiabatic deformation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : path ] and in the last part of this section we will describe each step of the deformation in detail .",
    "the adiabatic connection we establish also holds for time reversal invariant models of electrons with spin : for @xmath73 conserving models on the honeycomb lattice , kane and mele showed @xcite that one can view a @xmath0 tbi in 2-d as two copies of haldane s model @xcite with different effective magnetic fluxes ( with a net zero flux through the unit cell ) for different spins ( so that under time - reversal each copy is transformed into the other , thus preserving trs overall ) .",
    "moreover , as long as the gap does not close , @xmath73 non - conserving terms are also allowed . with this insight , it is evident that any lattice model that supports a quantum hall effect for spinless fermions will support a @xmath0 tbi for electrons with spin ( by taking the appropriate  second copy \" ) .",
    "there is an interesting consequence of the above mentioned adiabatic connection .",
    "it allows us to topologically relate the phases in the non - interacting tight - binding model at half - filling , see fig .",

    "[ fig : lattice](a ) . after a jordan - wigner transformation",
    "this model can be mapped onto a model of free majorana fermions hopping in the background of static @xmath0 fluxes .",

    "the ground - state sector corresponds to a uniform flux configuration .",
    "it possesses a representative free fermion model@xcite @xmath79 and @xmath80 specifies the way the time reversal symmetry is spontaneously broken .",

    "as the starting point for the continuous deformation we use a gauge equivalent pattern ( i ) obtained from ( o ) by replacing @xmath93 and @xmath94 . from ( i ) to ( ii ) the phase difference for hopping between the triangles is gradually reduced to zero .",
    "this can be achieved by replacing @xmath95 in @xmath96 by @xmath97 and continuously reducing @xmath98 from 1 to 0 .",
    "this process does not change the fluxes through the triangles and the dodecagons ; instead the global fluxes are modified and the whole spectrum is moved in @xmath99-space according to @xmath100 and @xmath101 . consequently , the direct gap stays constant . from ( ii ) to ( iii ) a continuous gauge transformation is applied to change the phase difference for hopping within the triangles from @xmath102 to @xmath103 ( this does not modify any flux and the gap remains constant ) . from ( iii ) to ( v ) we turn on @xmath35 as shown in ( iv ) and make @xmath2 real . along this path",

    "as long as there is a direct gap , the chern number is well - defined and regions with different values are necessarily separated by gap closings . however , there are also regions in parameter space where an indirect gap is closed indicating the presence of partially filled bands at half - filling , see fig .",
