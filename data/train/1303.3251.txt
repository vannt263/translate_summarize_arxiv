    "the problem of reconstructing a large integer from its several remainders modulo several smaller positive integers ( called moduli ) may occur in many applications , such as phase unwrapping in radar signal processing @xcite and frequency determination from several undersampled waveforms @xcite .",
    "the traditional solution for this problem is the chinese remainder theorem ( crt ) , see for example , @xcite , that uniquely formulates the solution from the remainders if all the moduli are co - prime and the large integer is less than the product of all the moduli . when the moduli are not co - prime , the large integer can be uniquely determined if it is less than the least common multiple ( lcm ) of all the moduli @xcite , where one may also find the reconstruction methods .",
    "however , it is well - known that the above solution is not robust in the sense that a small error in a remainder may cause a large error in the reconstruction solution , which may degrade the performance of its applications in phase unwrapping and frequency determination , since in these applications , signals are usually noisy and the detected remainders may be erroneous . for the robustness , there have been several studies recently @xcite .",
    "robust reconstructions from erroneous remainders were recently proposed in @xcite for a special case when the greatest common divisor ( gcd ) of all the moduli is more than @xmath0 and the remaining integers factorized by the gcd of all the moduli are co - prime . in this special case ,",
    "a closed - form reconstruction from erroneous remainders was proposed in @xcite and a necessary and sufficient condition on the remainder errors was also obtained in @xcite .",
    "it basically says that the reconstruction error is upper bounded by the remainder error level @xmath1 if @xmath1 is smaller than a quarter of the gcd of all the moduli @xcite .",
    "a special version of this result was obtained earlier in @xcite . in some applications ,",
    "an unknown , such as the phase unwrapping and frequency estimation , is real valued in general .",
    "so , in @xcite the closed - form robust crt algorithm was naturally generalized to real numbers .",
    "also , a lattice based method was proposed in @xcite to address the problem of estimating a real unknown distance with a closed - form algorithm using phase measurements taken at multiple co - prime wavelengths .",
    "one can see that there are constraints on the moduli in previous works .",
    "the constraints on the moduli may , however , limit the robustness when the range ( called dynamic range ) of the determinable integers is roughly fixed .    different from robustly reconstructing the large integer from its erroneous remainders , another existing approach is to accurately determine the large integer by using some of the error - free remainders among all the remainders @xcite , which may require that significantly many remainders are error - free and a large number of moduli / remainders may be needed .",
    "this approach may sacrifice the dynamic range for a given set of moduli ( or undersampling rates @xcite ) and furthermore , in some signal processing applications , to obtain error - free remainders may not be even possible , because observed signals are usually noisy . a probabilistic approach to deal with noises in crt",
    "was proposed in @xcite , where all the moduli are required to be primes .    in this paper , we consider the robust reconstruction problem for a general set of moduli on which the constraint used in @xcite is no longer required .",
    "we first present a necessary and sufficient condition for the remainder errors for a robust reconstruction from erroneous remainders with a general set of muduli , where a reconstruction method is also proposed .",
    "this can be thought of as a single stage robust crt .",
    "we then propose a two - stage robust crt by grouping the moduli into several smaller groups as follows .",
    "first , the robust single stage crt is applied to each group .",
    "then , with these robust reconstructions from all the groups , the robust single stage crt is applied again across the groups .",
    "interestingly , with this two - stage robust crt , the robust reconstruction holds even when the remainder error level @xmath1 is above the quarter of the gcd of all the moduli .",
    "the two - stage robust crt is then easily generalized to multi - stage robust crt . in this paper , we also propose an algorithm on how to group a set of moduli for the better reconstruction robustness of the two - stage robust crt in some special cases .",
    "note that the two - stage robust crt is first appeared in @xcite that is , however , based on the special single stage robust crt in @xcite when the remaining factors of all the moduli after factorizing out their gcd are co - prime .",
    "with the two - stage robust crt obtained in @xcite , the remainder error level @xmath1 is , in fact , not better than the quarter of the gcd of all the moduli .",
    "in contrast , our newly proposed two - stage or multi - stage robust crt in this paper is based on the generalized single stage robust crt for arbitrary moduli also newly obtained in this paper and as mentioned earlier , the remainder error level @xmath1 can be above the quarter of the gcd of all the moduli , i.e. , it achieves a better robustness bound than @xcite does .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , we first briefly introduce the robust crt results obtained in @xcite . we then propose our new single stage robust crt with the necessary and sufficient condition for a general set of moduli . in section [ sec3 ] ,",
    "we propose two - stage and multi - stage robust crt . in section",
    "[ sec4 ] , we propose an algorithm on how to group a set of moduli for a better reconstruction robustness of the two - stage robust crt . in section [ sec5 ]",
    ", we present some simulation results on estimating integers with a general set of moduli . in section [ sec6 ]",
    ", we conclude this paper .",
    "let us first see the robust remaindering problem .",
    "let @xmath2 be a positive integer , @xmath3 be @xmath4 moduli , and @xmath5 be the @xmath4 remainders of @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is an unknown integer , for @xmath9 .",
    "it is not hard to see that @xmath2 can be uniquely reconstructed from its @xmath4 remainders @xmath10 if and only if @xmath11 .",
    "if all the moduli @xmath12 are co - prime , then the chinese remainder theorem ( crt ) provides a simple reconstruction formula @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the problem we are interested in this paper is how to robustly reconstruct @xmath2 when the remainders @xmath10 have errors : @xmath13 where @xmath1 is an error level that may be determined by , for example , the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and is also called remainder error bound .",
    "now we want to reconstruct @xmath2 from these erroneous remainders @xmath14 and the known moduli @xmath12 . the basic idea for the robust crt in the recent studies and also",
    "this paper is to accurately determine the unknown integers @xmath8 in ( [ crt ] ) which are the folding numbers that may cause large errors in the reconstructions if they are erroneous .",
    "therefore , the problem is to correctly determine the folding numbers @xmath8 from these erroneous remainders @xmath14 .",
    "once @xmath8 for @xmath9 are correctly found , an estimate of @xmath2 can be given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 denote the errors of the remainders . from ( [ remainderbound ] ) , @xmath17 .",

    "the main results can be briefly described below .",
    "let @xmath26 be the gcd of all the moduli @xmath12 in ( [ crt ] ) .",
    "then @xmath27 , @xmath9 , and assume that all @xmath28 for @xmath9 are co - prime , i.e. , the gcd of any pair @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath30 is @xmath0 .",

    "set @xmath43 defined above contains only one element @xmath44 , and furthermore if @xmath45 , then @xmath46 .",
    "in addition , @xcite has proposed a @xmath0-d searching method with the order of @xmath47 searches .",
    "when @xmath4 or @xmath28 gets large , the searching complexity is still high .",
    "then , a closed - form robust crt algorithm and its necessary and sufficient condition for it to hold have been proposed in @xcite . for the closed - form algorithm",

    "for example , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 . when the remainder error level @xmath59 , any integer less than @xmath60 can be reconstructed within the same error level as the remainders from the erroneous remainders by using the algorithms in @xcite .",
    "a natural question is what will happen if a general set of moduli @xmath12 are used .",

    "to do so , we let the last @xmath69 equations in ( [ fangchengzu ] ) subtract the first one and we then have @xmath70 next , denote @xmath71 then , we can equivalently express equation ( [ fangchengzu2 ] ) again as @xmath72 since @xmath73 and @xmath74 are co - prime , by bzout s lemma ( lemma 1 in @xcite ) we get @xmath75 where @xmath50 , @xmath76 ( the set of integers ) and @xmath77 is the modular multiplicative inverse of @xmath73 modulo @xmath74 .",

    "when a determinable range of @xmath2 is fixed , we can add or delete some of the redundant moduli to or from the moduli set in order to get a better robustness bound for @xmath1 .",

    "let @xmath218 , and the moduli are @xmath219 . from corollary [ cor3 ] , we can get @xmath220 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 , @xmath223 .",
    "in addition , it has a closed - form algorithm to robustly reconstruct an unknown integer @xmath2 for @xmath224 . however , according to the result of @xcite , the remainder error bounds would be @xmath220 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 , @xmath227 .",
    "interestingly , the robustness bound result in this corollary is even better than that obtained in @xcite using a two - stage robust crt .",
    "what the result here tells us that for the set of moduli in corollary [ cor3 ] , which is the set considered in @xcite , it is not necessary to use a two - stage robust crt as what is done in @xcite . another remark we make here is that the notation @xmath176 above denotes the @xmath127th remainder error bound .",
    "later , without causing any notational confusion , @xmath228 will denote the remainder error bound for the remainders in the j - th group .",
    "from the study in the previous section , one can see that the robustness bound is kind of dependent on the gcd of the moduli .",
    "the larger the gcd is , the better the robustness bound is .",
    "however , the large gcd reduces the lcm of the moduli , i.e. , reduces the determinable range of the unknown integer @xmath2 . when a set of moduli are given , the maximal determinable range is given too , which is their lcm .",
    "then , the question is for a given set of moduli , can we improve the robustness bound obtained in corollary [ 111 ] ? note that in the single stage robust crt obtained in the previous section ,",
    "all the remainders and their related system of congruence equations are considered and solved together simultaneously .",
    "a natural question is : can we split the set of moduli into several groups so that the moduli in each group have a large gcd and remainders and their corresponding system of congruence equations in each group are considered and solved independently using the single stage robust crt obtained in the previous section ?",
    "if so , can we obtain a better robustness bound than that in corollary [ 111 ] for the single stage robust crt ? to answer these questions ,",
    "let us first see an example .",
    "suppose that a set of moduli @xmath229 are given and the gcd of these @xmath230 moduli is @xmath0 .",
    "these four moduli can be split to two groups @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",
    "the gcd of the two moduli in the first group is @xmath233 with @xmath234 , @xmath235 , and the gcd of the two moduli in the second group is @xmath236 with @xmath237 , @xmath238 .",
    "one can see that each group satisfies the condition in propositions [ wjwtheorem ] and [ wjwcorollary ] and therefore the closed - form robust crt in @xcite or the single stage robust crt in the previous section can be applied for the robust reconstruction of an unknown integer @xmath2 with robustness bound @xmath239 or @xmath240 , if @xmath241 l@xmath242 or @xmath241 l@xmath243 , respectively",
    ".    using the first group with moduli @xmath244 and @xmath245 and two remainders @xmath246 and @xmath247 , if the integer @xmath2 is in the range of @xmath248 , then @xmath2 can be uniquely determined by its two error free remainders @xmath246 and @xmath247 as @xmath249 with @xmath250 ; otherwise @xmath251 using two erroneous remainders @xmath252 and @xmath253 with error level @xmath1 , and the closed - form robust crt in @xcite or the single stage robust crt in the previous section for the first group , we can obtain an integer @xmath254 and @xmath255    similarly , using the second group with moduli @xmath256 and @xmath257 and two remainders @xmath258 and @xmath259 , if the integer @xmath2 is in the range of @xmath260 , then @xmath2 can be uniquely determined by its two error free remainders @xmath258 and @xmath259 as @xmath261 with @xmath262 ; otherwise @xmath263 using two erroneous remainders @xmath264 and @xmath265 with error level @xmath1 , and the closed - form robust crt in @xcite or the single stage robust crt in the previous section for the second group , we can obtain an integer @xmath266 and @xmath267    on the other hand , if integer @xmath2 is in the range of @xmath268 , it can be uniquely determined by its four error free remainders @xmath269 .",
    "this can be done either from the four remainders directly or from the two new remainders @xmath249 and @xmath261 of @xmath2 with two new moduli @xmath270 and @xmath271 with equations ( [ g1 ] ) and ( [ g2 ] ) , respectively . for the robustness ,",
    "as we mentioned earlier , the closed - form robust crt and the results in propositions [ wjwtheorem ] and [ wjwcorollary ] can not be applied to the four moduli and the four erroneous remainders directly since they do not satisfy the co - prime condition .",
    "in addition , according to our single stage robust crt in theorem [ them1 ] and corollary [ 111 ] obtained in the previous section , its robustness bound would be @xmath272 ( interestingly , for the @xmath230 moduli , their gcd is only @xmath0 ) .",
    "however , using the above grouping idea , the reconstruction of @xmath2 can be done in two stages : the first stage is to reconstruct @xmath254 in ( [ g11 ] ) and @xmath266 in ( [ g21 ] ) from the two groups , respectively ; the second stage is to reconstruct @xmath273 from its two possibly erroneous remainders @xmath254 and @xmath266 with two new moduli @xmath270 and @xmath271 . from the second stage , using the known robust crt again , we obtain @xmath274 ) , ( [ g21 ] ) and ( [ gg ] ) , one can see that with this two - stage approach , the robustness bound on the remainder error level @xmath1 is @xmath275 which is surprisingly even better than @xmath276 that is the robustness bound in corollary [ 111 ] using the single stage robust crt for general moduli obtained in the previous section .",
    "this means that using two or more groups for a set of moduli may have a better robustness bound than that using a single group for the whole set of moduli . clearly , for the better robustness , the way to group the moduli or remainders plays a very important role as one can see from the bounds above .",
    "note that the robustness bound @xmath277 in corollary [ 111 ] for the single stage robust crt for the moduli set @xmath229 is only half of the robustness bound @xmath278 for the same moduli set @xmath229 but with the grouping and the two - stage approach .",
    "we next present our results for general cases .",
    "first , we consider the case of two groups and two stages .",
    "let @xmath279 be the whole set of moduli that may not be necessarily all distinct .",
    "it is split to two groups with group 1 of @xmath280 moduli : @xmath281 ; and gruop 2 of @xmath282 moduli : @xmath283 .",
    "these two groups do not have to be disjoint .",
    "let @xmath2 be a positive integer , and @xmath284 be the corresponding remainders of @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath285 where @xmath286 and @xmath287 is an unknown integer for @xmath201 , @xmath288 .",
    "as we know , @xmath2 can be uniquely reconstructed from its @xmath289 remainders if and only if @xmath290 , where @xmath291 and @xmath292 . the congruence system ( [ 34 ] ) can be converted into the following two - stage congruences .",
    "for @xmath202 , and group @xmath105 , we can write @xmath293 then , the above @xmath249 and @xmath261 can be combined to form a new system of congruences : @xmath294 when @xmath295 , the two congruence equations are degenerated to a single equation and without loss of generality , we assume @xmath296 here and such a similar degenerated case is not considered either in what follows in this paper . replacing @xmath249 and @xmath261 in ( [ 3 ] ) by equations ( [ 1 ] ) , we have @xmath297 it is not hard to see that @xmath298 where @xmath299 for @xmath300 , @xmath288 . clearly , @xmath301    from the known values of all the moduli @xmath302 and all the erroneous remainders @xmath303 , if we can accurately determine @xmath304 and @xmath305 , then we can accurately determine @xmath287 .",

    ", we first assume that the set of moduli does not include any pair of @xmath135 and @xmath136 satisfying @xmath137 , because corollary [ cor2 ] has told us that such a redundant modulus @xmath136 does not help to increase the determinable range of @xmath2 , @xmath510 nor the robustness bound in a single stage robust crt . from condition ( [ bbbbbbb ] )",
    "we need to assure that all @xmath394 in ( [ gj ] ) and @xmath395 in ( [ gg1 ] ) after a grouping strictly greater than @xmath511 in corollary [ 111 ] for the single stage robust crt .",
    "then , we have an algorithm as follows .    1 .   for each @xmath12 , @xmath9 ,",
    "find all @xmath87 , @xmath512 , satisfying @xmath513 . with @xmath12 ,",
    "form the corresponding set @xmath514 : @xmath515 thus , with each set @xmath514 , we have @xmath516 if modulus @xmath12 satisfies @xmath517 for all @xmath87 , @xmath512 , then we let @xmath518 .",
    "2 .   among all of the @xmath4 sets @xmath514 for @xmath9 , there may be one or more pairs , @xmath519 and @xmath520 , satisfying @xmath521 . in this case",
    ", we can delete the smaller set @xmath519 and only keep the larger set @xmath520 .",

    ", from the remaining sets of @xmath522 , we find all such combinations of @xmath523 that @xmath524 exactly includes all moduli @xmath525 . in other words , if anyone @xmath526 for @xmath527 is deleted from a combination @xmath523 , then @xmath528 is a proper subset of @xmath525 , i.e. , @xmath529 4 .",
    "as for every combination in the above , treat each @xmath530 as a small group and calculate its lcm as @xmath531 , @xmath532 . then , check whether @xmath533 if there is one combination @xmath534 as above to make inequality ( [ gggg ] ) hold , then every @xmath535 , @xmath532 , is strictly greater than @xmath536 . according to ( [ bbbbbbb ] ) in theorem [ theeeeee ] , one can see that this combination is just a grouping as desired and it enlarges a robustness bound for remainders in every group by using the two - stage robust crt .",
    "otherwise , if for every possible combination in step 3 ) , inequality ( [ gggg ] ) does not hold , then it is said that we fail to use this algorithm to enlarge a robustness bound for remainders in every group by using the two - stage robust crt .",
    "let us first consider the above grouping algorithm for the case of @xcite , i.e. , the remaining factors @xmath28 of the moduli @xmath27 divided by their gcd @xmath26 , @xmath9 , are co - prime .",
    "first , we find all @xmath518 , @xmath9 .",
    "next , there is only one combination @xmath537 satisfying ( [ combinat ] ) , and we treat each @xmath518 as one group , then calculate @xmath538 in ( [ gggg ] ) , which equals to @xmath539 . in conclusion , we fail to find a grouping to enlarge a robustness bound for remainders in every group by using the two - stage robust crt , which can be also confirmed from the earlier result in corollary [ jielun ] .",
    "next , we give a positive example .",
    "consider a set of moduli @xmath540 , where @xmath26 is an integer .",
    "as one group , using the single stage robust crt , its robustness bound is @xmath539 .",
    "according to the above grouping algorithm , find @xmath541 sets : @xmath542 , @xmath543 , @xmath544 , @xmath545 , @xmath546 , @xmath547 and @xmath548 . among them",
    ", there are only four combinations satisfying ( [ combinat ] ) as follows : @xmath549 , @xmath550 , @xmath551 and @xmath552",
    ". then , check whether one of the above four combinations satisfies inequality ( [ gggg ] ) . fortunately , for the first combination @xmath549 , inequality ( [ gggg ] ) holds .",
    "we can calculate @xmath553 , @xmath554 and @xmath555 , all of which are strictly greater than @xmath393 .",
    "thus , we have obtained a grouping method of the moduli to enlarge a robustness bound for remainders in every group by using the two - stage robust crt .",
    "as one can see in the proof of corollary [ jielun ] and in the above algorithm and examples , a modulus @xmath12 may be repeatedly used in more than one groups in the two - stage robust crt .",
    "its aim is to make @xmath395 and @xmath394 after grouping greater than or equal to the robustness bound by using the single stage robust crt for the whole set of moduli .",
    "recall the case of grouping a set of three moduli @xmath489 .",
    "assume @xmath556 . from corollary",
    "[ 111 ] , the robustness bound for using the single robust crt is @xmath557 .",
    "according to the above grouping moduli algorithm in two - stage robust crt , they are split to two groups : @xmath495 and @xmath494 .",
    "one can see that @xmath558 , @xmath559 , @xmath560 , @xmath561 and @xmath562 . in this grouping method ,",
    "the robustness bound for remainders in group @xmath495 is @xmath563 and the robustness bound for remainders in group @xmath494 is @xmath564 .",
    "as @xmath565 and @xmath566 are greater than @xmath557 , a robustness bound for remainders in each group depends on the value of @xmath395 .",
    "when @xmath562 is less than @xmath557 , a robustness bound for remainders in each group is worse than that for the single robust crt .",
    "thus , we should repeat modulus @xmath130 in group @xmath494 , and the two groups become @xmath495 and @xmath498 . in this way",
    ", we enlarge a robustness bound for group @xmath495 and keep the robustness bound for group @xmath498 non - changed .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath562 is larger than @xmath557 , we do not need to repeat modulus @xmath130 , since the robustness bound for group @xmath495 and the robustness bound for group @xmath494 are both greater than @xmath557 .",
    "this example tells us that , to enlarge the robustness bound , whether a modulus @xmath12 is repeatedly used or not in multiple groups depends on the grouping method and the set of moduli . repeating a modulus , sometimes ,",
    "may help to enlarge the robustness bound but sometimes may not .",
    "in this section , we present some simple simulation results to evaluate the proposed single stage robust crt algorithm and the two - stage robust crt algorithm for integers with a general set of moduli .",
    "let us first consider the case when @xmath567 , @xmath568 and @xmath569 .",
    "these three moduli do not satisfy the condition that @xmath28 , @xmath570 , are co - prime and thus the robust crt obtained in @xcite can not be applied directly .",
    "however , we can use our proposed single stage robust crt . according to corollary [ 111 ] ,",
    "the maximal range of the determinable @xmath2 is @xmath571 and the maximal remainder error level @xmath1 for the robustness is upper bounded by @xmath572 from ( [ tttttt ] ) . in this simulation , the unknown integer @xmath2",
    "is uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath573 .",
    "we consider the maximal remainder error levels @xmath574 , and the errors are also uniformly distributed on @xmath575 $ ] in the remainders .",
    "@xmath576 trials for each of them are implemented .",
    "the mean error @xmath577 between the estimated @xmath273 in ( [ averagen ] ) and the true @xmath2 is plotted by the solid line marked with @xmath578 , and the theoretical estimation error upper bound in ( [ bound of fre ] ) is plotted by the solid line marked with @xmath579 in fig .",
    "[ figone ] .",
    "obviously , one can see that for a general set of moduli the reconstruction errors of @xmath2 from the erroneous remainders are small compared to the range of @xmath2 .",
    "next , we compare the robustness between the single stage and the two - stage robust crt algorithms for the above same set of moduli . in this case , the conditions of the maximal remainder error levels for the single stage and the two - stage robust crt algorithms of two groups @xmath495 and @xmath494 are @xmath580 and @xmath581 , i.e. , @xmath582 and @xmath583 , respectively .",
    "let us consider the maximal remainder error levels @xmath1 from @xmath584 to @xmath585 , and @xmath576 trials for each of them .",
    "the unknown integer @xmath2 is taken as before .",
    "[ figtwo ] shows the curves of the error bounds and the mean estimation errors @xmath577 for both the single stage and the two - stage robust crt algorithms .",
    "note that from our single stage robust crt theory , the valid error bound for @xmath1 is only upto @xmath586 , which can be seen from the simulation results that the mean estimation error @xmath577 starts to deviate the previous line trend at @xmath587 , then increases significantly and breaks the linear error bound when @xmath1 is further greater , i.e. , robust reconstruction may not hold . on the other hand , with the two - stage robust crt algorithm",
    ", one can see that the curve of the mean estimation error @xmath577 is always below the curve of the error bound , i.e. , we can robustly reconstruct @xmath2 , @xmath588 , even when the maximal error level is @xmath583 that is the upper bound for @xmath1 obtained in this paper for the two - stage robust crt algorithm .",
    "these simulation results confirm the theory obtained in this paper .",
    "in this paper , we considered the robust reconstruction problem from erroneous remainders , namely robust crt problem , for a general set of moduli that may not satisfy the condition needed in the previous robust crt studies in @xcite .",
    "we obtained a necessary and sufficiency condition for the robust crt when all the erroneous remainders are used together , called single stage robust crt .",
    "interestingly , our proposed single stage robust crt may have better robustness than that of the robust crt obtained in @xcite even when it could be applied . to further improve the robustness",
    ", we then proposed a multi - stage robust crt , where the moduli are grouped into several groups .",
    "as an example , for the two - stage robust crt , our proposed single stage robust crt is first applied to each group and then applied across the groups second time .",
