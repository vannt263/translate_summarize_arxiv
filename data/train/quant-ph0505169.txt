    "most recently , many theoretical investigations about quantum information transfer ( qit ) based on quantum spin systems are carried out in order to implement scalable quantum computation bose1,ekert , st , ly , sz , key-1,tjo04 , key-17,key-6,key-18,bbg , plenio04,mpater . here",
    ", the quantum spin system usually behaves as a quantum data bus to intergrade many qubits",
    ". these investigations mainly aim at transferring quantum state through a solid state data bus with minimal spatial and dynamical control over the on - chip interactions between qubits . in this paper",
    "we will pay attention to a fundamental aspect of qit and generally study the wave packet spreading and revival of bloch electrons in one - dimensional lattice systems .    for the problems of wave packet evolution",
    ", we can cast back for much earlier investigations by schr@xmath0dinger and others about the quantum mechanical descriptions of localization of macroscopic objects @xcite .",
    "they demonstrated that a class of wave packets ( now we call them coherent and squeezed states ) of harmonic oscillator can keep their shapes during propagation and their centers of mass ( cm ) follow a classical trajectory .",
    "as a semi - classical solution of the schr@xmath0dinger equation , a superposition of the much higher excitation states with almost - homogeneous spectrum form an coherent - state type wave packet in the coulomb potential , which can show the phenomena of non - spreading evolution and self - interference on classical orbits @xcite . this prediction has been demonstrated in the experiment involving the laser - induced excitation of atomic rydberg wave packets @xcite .",
    "we can refer such non - spreading wave packet evolution with a complete auto - correlation @xcite as a perfect qit if we could encode the quantum information in the spin polarization of electron .",
    "the investigation in this paper is motivated by our recent explorations about the qit based on the quantum system possessing a commensurate structure of energy spectrum matched with a symmetry ( sms ) , which ensures a perfect qit both in one and higher dimensional cases @xcite .",
    "actually the almost - homogeneous spectrum for the coherent - state type wave packet just satisfies the condition of sms .",
    "in particular the non - spreading transfer of a zero - momentum wave packet is attractive for the task of quantum information transmission since a static superposition can behaves as a quantum storage .",
    "this is very similar to the scheme of the quantum storage of photon based on atomic ensemble where two stored photonic wave packets localized in the same position with different polarizations can function to decode the information of qubit @xcite .",
    "this paper will focus on a realistic , but simplest bloch electron system ( see the fig .",
    "1 ) in a magnetic field where the on - site coulomb interactions are ignored . in this sense",
    "the spin polarization is always conversed during the time evolution of an arbitrary state and then quantum information encoded in the spin polarization of electron can be well protected .",
    "thus the locality of electron wave packet becomes a crucial element to maximize the fidelity of qit .",
    "we show that , by the quantized  flux threading the ring lattice , the effective dispersion relation of a bloch electron can be modulated into a liner dispersion regime that possesses sms structure , and then an electronic wave packet with the components localized in this linear regime can be transferred without changes of its shape .",
    "this feature can be utilized to perform the high - fidelity qit encoded in the polarization of the spin .",
    "the phenomena of wave packet revivals and self - interference can also be demonstrated for the cases beyond the linear dispersion regime .",
    "these novel quantum coherence effects may suggest a feasible protocol to implement the perfect qit of bloch electrons manipulated by the external magnetic field .",
    "in this section , we present the bloch electron model under consideration , a simple tight - binding model in an external magnetic field . here , the coulomb interaction is ignored for simply .",
    "we restrict our attention to the influence of the applied field on the propagation of the bloch electrons .    consider a ring lattice with @xmath1 sites threaded by a magnetic field illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "the hamiltonian of the corresponding tight - binding model @xmath2=-j\\sum_{j,\\sigma } ( e^{i2\\pi \\phi /n}a_{j,\\sigma } ^{\\dagger } a_{j+1,\\sigma } + h.c.),\\]]depends on the magnetic flux @xmath3 through the ring in the unit of flux quantum @xmath4 . here , @xmath5 is the creation operator of bloch electron at @xmath6th site with spin @xmath7 .",
    "the flux @xmath3 does not exert force on the bloch electrons , but can change the local phase of its wave function due to the aharanov - bohm ( ab ) effect . note that the interaction between the field and electrons is independent of the intrinsic degree of freedom - spin",
    ". this will be crucial to employ such kind of setup to transfer quantum information encoded in the polarization of the spin .",
    "because of the ab effect , the role of the magnetic flux can not be removed trivially .",
    "now we consider the evolution of the gwp@xmath8with the velocity @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , the half - width of the wave packet @xmath11and the normalization factor @xmath12 .",
    "the limitation for the width of the gwp ensures the locality the state and avoids the overlap between the head and the tail of the wave packet .",
    "we will see that as time evolution , the head and tail do meet in certain situation and the interference phenomenon occurs .     in position - space @xmath13 of the 100-site ring with @xmath14 .",
    "the time @xmath15 is in the unit of @xmath16._,width=6 ]    in the following , we will show that the appropriate magnetic flux can ensure the transfer of the wave packet without spreading .",
    "the well - known bloch dispersion relation @xmath17can be obtained through the fourier transformation @xmath18which can be employed to diagonalize @xmath19 $ ] as @xmath2=\\sum_{k,\\sigma } \\varepsilon _ { k}n_{k,\\sigma } .\\]]with the number operator @xmath20 .",
    "it is observed that , when we tune the flux @xmath3 into each discrete values @xmath21for @xmath22there is a linear dispersion regime with momenta @xmath23 around zero , i.e. , @xmath24 . for the wave packets as a superposition of those eigenstates with momenta just in this region",
    ", then the effective hamiltonian becomes @xmath25which is of the ultra - relativistic  type with the effective light velocity  @xmath26 and @xmath27is the bloch momentum operator .",
    "obviously , this displacement effect time can directly result in a non - spreading wave packets transmission in the linear dispersion regime . indeed .",
    "fig . 3 illustrates how the quantized  magnetic flux @xmath28 where @xmath29 can speed up the zero - momentum gaussian wave packet ( gwp ) @xmath30 centered at site @xmath31 with the width @xmath32 .",
    "the details of the will be given in the next section .",
    "actually , with the linearized hamiltonian @xmath33 , the time evolution of some states can be described as a spatial translation by the evolution operator @xmath34with a displacement @xmath35 . here",
    "the the translational operator is defined by @xmath36for arbitrary @xmath37 .    for small @xmath38",
    ", @xmath39 is also a gwp of width @xmath38 around @xmath40 in @xmath23-space , and then the wave function at instance @xmath15 is a translated gwp @xmath41which is centered at @xmath42 .",
    "the overall phase factor @xmath43 has no effect on the final result .",
    "it is  seen that the wave packet moves with velocity @xmath44 . since all the wave functions satisfy the periodic boundary condition @xmath45we have @xmath46obviously , the wave packet moves along the ring keeping the initial shape without any spreading as illustrated in fig .",
    "2 schematically .",
    "to analyze the cyclic motion of bloch electrons , the numerical simulation is performed for a zero - momentum gwp with @xmath47 in the system of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the simulated time evolution of wave packet is plotted in fig .",
    "3 . for the cases with different values of @xmath3 and @xmath38 ,",
    "the autocorrelation functions @xmath50which can be used to describe the properties of the electron propagation , are investigated numerically .",
    "the results for @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xmath55 are plotted in fig .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) , which show that a zero - momentum gwp with small @xmath38 can be transferred without spreading when @xmath3 are around each @xmath56 .",
    "meanwhile , the flux threading the ring can control the shape and destination of the final wave packet .",
    "it is observed from the above analysis that the flux plays an important role for manipulating non - spreading wave packet .",
    "actually , such phenomenon can also be understood by the following transformation of the basis vector of hilbert space .",
    "the existence of the flux is equivalent to adding a speed to boost the zero - momentum wave packet since the magnetic flux provides an extra phase to the basis in the position - space , i.e. , @xmath57 in other words , a gwp with small @xmath38 and momentum @xmath58 , can transfer along the ring without spreading approximately .",

    "it shows that for small @xmath63 and @xmath64 the gwp can be transferred without spreading .",

    ", the spatial properties of the carrying particle , i.e. the bloch electron , seems to be irrelevant since only amplitudes and relative phases are used to encode quantum information .",
    "however , when the propagation of the bloch electron can be exploited to transfer the information of qubit , the non - spreading propagation of the carrier is very crucial for the expected high - fidelity of quantum state transfer from a location to another .    with the above consideration we can imagine the electronic wave packets with spin polarization as an analogue of photon flying qubit , the type ii ( polarized ) photon qubit where the quantum information was encoded in its two polarization states .",
    "we define the solid state flying qubit , at a single location @xmath66 in a quantum wire , as the two bloch electronic wave packets @xmath67 and @xmath68 be encoding as @xmath69because of the intrinsic linearity of the schr@xmath0dinger equation , it is self - consistent to encode an arbitrary state @xmath70as @xmath71and then it is transferred to another place @xmath72 with a very high fidelity due to the feature of non - spreading propagation of bloch electron .",
    "we now turn our attention to the problem of non - spreading propagation of bloch electronic wave packets beyond the linear dispersion regime .",
    "we consider a zero - momentum gwp in an external field with @xmath3 far from @xmath73 ( or a gwp with small momentum @xmath9 but @xmath74 ) . because of the nonlinear dispersion relation , such kind of wave packet spreads while its center is moving .",
    "it is clear that , when the head of the wave packet catches up with its tail , quantum interference phenomena set in .    in order to demonstrate this phenomenon ,",
    "numerical simulation is performed for a gwp with @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( or a zero - momentum gwp with the external magnetic flux @xmath77 ) in the @xmath78-site ring system .",
    "the time evolution of the gwp obtained by numerical simulation is plotted in fig .",
    "the interference fringe appears when the gwp spreads , which demonstrates the self - interference phenomenon .",
    "the profile of the fringe can be estimated analytically as follows .    .",

    "such kind of wave packet spreads while its center is still moving .",
    "since all the wave functions satisfy the periodic boundary condition @xmath92 , at certain instant @xmath15 , there is an overlap between the head and tail parts of the wave packet and then the quantum interference phenomena occurs . in other words , when the gwp spreads over the circumference of the ring , we need to consider the virtual superposition of the head  and tail .    since the widely spreading gwp can wind the ring many times , the virtual superposition can be considered as the re - normalized wave function @xmath93where @xmath94is a normalization factor . for small @xmath95 , one can only take the summation over @xmath96 as approximation , which results in spatial interference fringe @xmath97\\end{aligned}\\]]with the effective wave vector@xmath98and initial phase @xmath99here , @xmath100 and @xmath101\\]]only provide the modulation to the fringe .",

    "4(b ) , the interference fringe at @xmath103 obtained by numerical simulation and the analytical approximate result are plotted .",
    "it shows that the theoretical analysis is in agreement with the result of numerical simulation .",
    "now we consider the special case of zero - momentum gwps moving along a lattice without magnetic field . in this case , although the dispersion relation for such kind of gwps is nonlinear , the quantum revival is still possible since the @xmath104-dispersion also meets the condition of sms st , ly2 . to demonstrate this numerical simulation for the time evolution of a gwp with @xmath47 in a ring of @xmath78-sites",

    "the revival time is @xmath106 in the general cases , where @xmath107 is the greatest common divisor of energy - level spacing between any two eigen states .",

    "now we consider a special case , in which the initial zero - momentum gwp is centered at the middle of the chain .",
    "obviously , the parity of the gwp with respect to the reflection symmetry is even .",
    "thus expansion coefficients of the gwp for all the eigen states with odd parity are all zero , which means that the effective levels driven the gwp are only the half set .",
    "thus this fact results in a particular revival time@xmath110    to verify the above analysis , the autocorrelation functions are also calculated for the initial zero - momentum gwps with @xmath47 and @xmath111  in the ring of @xmath78-sites and chain .",
