    "euve 211558.6 was discovered during the _ euve _ all sky survey ( bowyer et al 1996 ) and also during the _ rosat _ all sky survey ( rx j21155840 , voges et al 1997 ) . from optical spectra , craig ( 1996 ) suggested that rx j21155840 is a magnetic cataclysmic variable ( mcv ) .",
    "further spectroscopic observations by vennes et al ( 1996 ) suggested an orbital period ( @xmath0 ) of 110.8 min or an alias at 102.8 min .",
    "optical polarimetry obtained by schwope et al ( 1997 ) showed variable circular polarisation of up to 15 percent , indicating that it is a member of the polar sub - class of mcvs . in these systems",
    "the accreting white dwarf has a sufficiently strong magnetic field to lock the spin of the white dwarf into synchronous rotation with the binary period .",
    "the bulk of the accretion luminosity is liberated at x - ray / euv wavelengths .",
    "schwope et al ( 1997 ) also suggested that the orbital period differs with respect to the spin period of the white dwarf by @xmath1 .",
    "they concluded that the spectroscopic period of 110.8 min represents the binary orbital period , while the photometric period of 109.84 min or 109.65 min represents the spin period of the white dwarf ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "if confirmed , this would make rx j21155840 the fourth near - synchronous polar and the first one below the 23 hr orbital period gap . therefore to determine if rx j21155840 is indeed near - synchronous , we obtained white light polarimetric observations covering 2 weeks .",
    "rx j21155840 was observed in white light using the saao 1.9 m telescope and uct polarimeter ( cropper 1985 ) between 1997 july 29 and 1997 august 11 .",
    "data were obtained on 10 nights over this interval although the total amount of data obtained on each night varied .",
    "conditions ranged from photometric to non - photometric .",
    "sky measurements were obtained every 1525 mins and subtracted from the source measurements by a polynomial fit to the sky data .",
    "polarised and non - polarised standard stars ( hsu & breger 1982 ) and calibration polaroids were observed at the beginning of the night to set the position angle offsets and efficiency factors .",
    "the white light intensity data are similar to those shown in schwope et al ( 1997 ) in that unlike most polars they do not show large photometric variations , although humps were seen in some of the data sets .",
    "we recorded low levels ( typically 34 percent ) of linear polarisation . in this paper , however , we concentrate on the circular polarisation data since the intensity data were compromised to some extent by non - photometric conditions on some nights .",
    "the circular polarisations are shown in fig .",
    "[ cpol ] . for most of the observation",
    "the circular polarisation is either close to zero or shows positive excursions which follow the intensity curve at some epochs .",
    "however , there are occasions when negative circular polarisation is seen ( hjd 2450000 + 659 , 666 and 672 ) .",
    "similar behaviour was seen by schwope et al ( 1997 ) , although they had circular polarisation from short sections of data on only 3 days .",
    "( 8,12.5 ) ( -1.5,-1.5 )    in fully synchronised polars , the spin period of the white dwarf is equal to the binary orbital period . in these systems",
    "the circular polarisation curves are broadly repeatable from cycle to cycle since the accretion flow is directed onto the same accretion pole(s ) .",
    "these observations showing modulated circular polarisation of positive polarity at some epochs and negative polarity at other epochs suggests that rx j21155840 is not fully synchronised .    while a discrete fourier transform ( dft )",
    "may not be the optimum method to analyse intensity or polarisation curve of a near - synchronous polar since there may be phase shifts between the curves for each pole , we use a dft for this first stage of our investigation .",
    "[ dft ] shows the amplitude spectrum of the circular polarisation data without subtracting the mean .",
    "the highest amplitude peak corresponds to a period of 110.889 mins  similar to the spectroscopic period of 110.8 mins reported by vennes et al ( 1996 ) .",
    "moving higher in frequency , the next peak in amplitude corresponds to a period of 109.547 mins  similar to the shorter of the two possible optical photometric periods , 109.84 and 109.65 mins , reported by schwope et al ( 1997 ) .",
    "we take the periods 110.889 and 109.547 found from our dft to represent the binary orbital frequency , @xmath3 , and the spin frequency of the white dwarf , @xmath4 , respectively . a side band frequency 2@xmath5",
    "corresponding to a period of 108.237 mins is then very close to an amplitude peak at 108.38 mins in the dft ( this side band frequency is prominent in the near - synchronous polar by cam : mason et al 1998 ) . at much lower frequencies ,",
    "the spin - orbit beat frequency @xmath6 , which corresponds to a period of 6.28 days , is within the fwhm of the highest amplitude peak seen at the lowest frequencies ( 7.05 days ) .",
    "the next two highest frequencies in the dft ( 1.19 and 0.88 days ) are aliases of this spin - orbit beat frequency .",
    "so far we can therefore account for the principle amplitude peaks in the dft at frequencies lower than 0.0002 hz . moving to the first harmonics of the proposed spin and orbital periods ( close to 0.0003 hz )",
    ", we find that twice our proposed spin frequency , 2@xmath4 , corresponds exactly with a prominent amplitude peak .",
    "the prominent peak at 3.02442@xmath7 hz ( = 55.107 mins ) is the @xmath8 side - band frequency .",
    "we also detect the 3@xmath4 harmonic and the 4@xmath9 side - band frequency    to test our proposed values of @xmath0 = 110.889 mins and @xmath2 = 109.547 mins , we pre - whitened the circular polarisation data with these two frequencies ( and their second and third harmonics ) , the 2@xmath5 side band frequency ( @xmath10108.38 mins ) , the 4@xmath11 side band frequency ( @xmath12=114.956 mins ) and the more @xmath13 side band frequencies ( shown in the lower panel of fig . [ dft ] ) .",
    "all frequencies which have an amplitude greater than 1 percent have been removed .",
    "this implies that if any other frequencies are present in the amplitude spectrum then they are present at a low level .",
    "we show in table [ periods ] the peak amplitudes of all the frequencies we can distinguish , together with their equivalent periods .",
    "we note that not all of the frequencies quoted in table [ periods ] are necessarily significant ( it is difficult to assign significance levels to amplitude peaks ) .",
    "we have merely noted those combinations of spin and orbital frequencies which coincide with a peak in the amplitude spectrum .",
    "( 12,10 ) ( -3,-28.2 )    .the frequencies in the amplitude spectrum which we can distinguish : we show the frequency in herz and its equivalent period in mins .",
    "we do not necessarily claim that all of these frequencies are significant .",

    "<S> following the suggestion of schwope et al that the magnetic cataclysmic variable rx j21155840 maybe a near - synchronous polar , we obtained optical polarimetry of this system over a 2 week period . from a power spectrum of the circular polarimetry data we determine that the spin period of the white dwarf and the binary orbital period which differ by 1.2 percent . </S>",
    "<S> rx j21155840 is thus the fourth near synchronous polar and has the shortest spin - orbit beat period : 6.3 days . by folding the data on spin , beat and orbital periods we find evidence that the accretion stream is directed towards opposite magnetic poles as the stream precesses around the white dwarf on the spin - orbit beat period . </S>",
    "<S> the phasing requires that the accretion flow must be directed onto the same magnetic field line at all spin - orbit beat phases implying that at some phases the flow must follow a path around the white dwarf before accreting . </S>",
    "<S> this is difficult to reconcile with simple views of how the accretion stream attaches onto the magnetic field of the white dwarf .    </S>",
