    "obscured seyfert 2s high - resolution observations have revealed soft x - ray spectra dominated by line emission from h - like and he - like elements as neon , oxygen , carbon , as well as from fe l - shell transitions ( fe xvii to fe xxiv ) ( sako et al . 2000 ; kinkhabwala et al .",

    "2005 ; mckernan et al .",
    "2007 ) . where these winds originate and are powered is still an open question .",
    "several regions at different distances from the central engine , like the nlr , the obscuring torus and the accretion disk have been proposed as a possible location for the gas ( crenshaw et al . 2003 and references therein ) .    for radio galaxies",
    "the investigation of the nuclear environment through high - resolution spectroscopy has just started .",
    "there are some hints that in obscured rgs ( seen at high inclination angles ) the soft x - ray spectra are similar to their radio - quiet ( rq ) counterparts , seyfert 2s .",
    "evidence for photoionised gas has already been revealed by emission lines in the soft x - ray spectra of 3c 445 ( grandi et al .",
    "2007 ; sambruna et al . 2007 ) and 3c 33 ( torresi et al . 2009 ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the morphological coincidence between soft x - ray and optical [ oiii]@xmath105007 emission suggests the nlr as the location of such gas ( torresi et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the current picture is less clear for the radio - loud ( rl ) counterparts of seyfert 1s , where doppler amplification of the jet flux can play a key role in blurring the spectral features : for example , rgs are known to have weaker compton reflection signatures and weaker fe k@xmath11 lines when compared to seyfert 1s ( grandi , malaguti & fiocchi 2006 and references therein ) . up to now , the search for warm absorbers in unobscured rgs ( seen at low inclination angles ) has been unsuccessful , except for a claim of its existence in 3c  382 and 3c  390.3 from analysis of asca data ( reynolds 1997 ) .",
    "therefore it is completely unclear whether winds can form and/or survive in the nuclear regions of rl agns , where large amounts of the gravitational power is funneled into relativistic collimated plasma .",
    "addressing this point is fundamental to clarify the physical link among accretion flows , winds and jet , and the influence that each of these components can have on the host galaxy .",

    "a quite steep power - law is not unexpected in this source known to have a strong soft excess .",
    "we investigated whether an extended thermal component ( apec ) is required by the data , as suggested by the _",

    "the fit did not improve significantly , nor did the shape of the residuals ( c=5261 ) .",
    "therefore we decided not to include any other continuum components .",
    "however , as discussed below , we checked for the presence of weak collisional emission lines .    to start with a phenomenological approach ,",
    "the spectra were divided into a number of regions containing about the same number of bins each ( 100 ) .",
    "we performed an accurate inspection of every single region . where the spectra showed a particularly evident absorption feature , a gaussian profile with 0-width and a negative normalization was added to the model .",
    "only lines yielding an improvement in the fit higher than @xmath24c@xmath125 ( corresponding to @xmath12 95@xmath5 for two interesting parameters ) were taken into account .",
    "for these structures the equivalent width was estimated and the corresponding atomic transition identified through several atomic databases such as chianti ( dere et al .",
    "1997 ; landi et al .",
    "2006 ) , atomdb webguide and nist .",
    "the parameters of the most prominent lines are reported in table  1 and the phenomenological fit is shown in figure  1 .",
    "two other absorption lines probably corresponding to fexxi / mgxi and siv / nvii transitions , although observed , are not reported in table 1 because of their marginal detection ( @xmath24c = 5 ) .",
    "none of the detected features is due to local ( galactic ) absorption .",
    "finally we clearly detected an emission line ( @xmath24c=6 ) identified as oviii ly@xmath11 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "this is not an unusual result .",
    "emission features are often observed in sources showing signatures of warm absorber ( blustin et al . 2002 ; turner et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "once the presence of absorption lines was ascertained via the phenomenological analysis , the next step was to study the physical properties of the gas using a self consistent modeling of the spectrum .",
    "extensive simulations were carried out using the photoionisation code xstar ( v2.1ln9 ) .",
    "the output was a grid of models ( afterwards simply called xstar model ) that can be fitted to the data in xspec .",
    "each model in the grid represents a photoionised spectrum characterized by a particular value of the column density and the ionisation parameter .",
    "our explored parameter range is n@xmath18=[10@xmath34 , 10@xmath35 and log@xmath6=[-3 , 3 ] .",
    "we assumed a simple spherical geometry for the illuminated gas ( covering factor = 1 ) , solar abundances ( grevesse & sauval 1998 ) , and an illuminating continuum from 1 to 1000 rydbergs derived from the intrinsic spectral energy distribution sed of the source , with l@xmath36  erg  s@xmath3 ( figure  2 ) .",
    "the turbulent velocity of the gas was set to v@xmath37=100  km  s@xmath3 , as the limited rgs statistics did not allow to constrain the intrinsic width of the absorption features .",
    "the xstar model obtained from these simulations was applied as an _ xspec _ multiplicative component to the power - law and fitted to the data .",
    "the fit significantly improved ( @xmath24c=160 ) , as xstar can take into account any possible absorption feature in the spectrum .",
    "we note that the photon index is completely consistent with the one obtained from a power - law only fit .",
    "the presence of a highly ionised gas phase is confirmed , indeed the best fit required a high ionisation parameter log@xmath6=2.69@xmath38  erg  cm  s@xmath3 and a column density n@xmath18=3.19@xmath39 @xmath40  @xmath1 .",
    "the robustness of these results is attested by the n@xmath18- log@xmath6 confidence contours ( 68@xmath5 90@xmath5 99@xmath5 ) shown in figure  3 ( _ upper panel _ ) .",
    "we attempted to estimate the gas outflow velocities by measuring the line shifts between theoretical and observed values of the energy centroid allowing the redshift parameter ( z ) of the xstar model to vary .",
    "we found reasonable outflow speeds of the order of -1200@xmath41  km  s@xmath3 , consistent with typical outflow velocities in seyfert 1s ( blustin et al .",
    "2002 ; blustin et al .",
    "2005 ) when the absorption gas is seen along the line - of - sight .",
    "incidentally we point out that the phenomenogical identifications proposed in table  1 are confirmed by the xstar model ( see figure  3 _ lower panel _ ) .",
    "we note that the energy centroid of the oviii  ly@xmath11 emission line does not require any blueshift ( although with large uncertainties ) .",
    "however it may suggest that , contrary to the absorption lines observed along the line - of - sight , the emission comes from an extended region around the source , maybe a shell , expanding in all directions .",
    "the high - resolution analysis of the blrg 3c  382 has revealed that relativistic collimated plasma and slower outflows of photoionised gas can coexist in the same object .",
    "the outflowing gas is found in a hot phase as attested by the derived ionisation parameter log@xmath6=2.69  erg  cm  s@xmath3 deduced with the xstar simulations .",
    "most of the light elements are indeed completely ionised , and the strongest absorption features correspond to h - like elements and l - shell iron states . in seyfert",
    "1s warm absorbers are complex and multi - phase , often indicating that layers of gas at different ionisation states are part of the same outflow ( blustin et al .",
    "2005 ) . in the present case ,",
    "only one component of hot gas was observed , without apparent traces of a colder component .",
    "nonetheless , the physical conditions of the gas in 3c  382 warm absorber are quite similar to those measured in the highest ionised absorber in their radio - quiet counterparts ( ngc  4051 , krongold et al . 2007 ; mkr  279 , costantini et al . 2007 ;",
    "iras13349 + 2438 , sako et al .",
    "taking into account the short exposure time and the very simple assumptions in the xstar model , the result appears encouraging .",
    "we are aware that setting v@xmath37 to an _ a priori _ fixed value could potentially overpredict the column density if the real turbulent velocity is larger .",
    "interestingly , also the ews of the absorption lines detected in 3c 382 are consistent with those generally measured in seyfert 1s ( yaqoob et al . 2003 ; turner et al .",
    "this similarity suggests a negligible jet contribution to the soft x - ray spectrum , although the large uncertainties in ew prevent more quantitative statements from being made .    in order to localize the warm absorber we estimate a minimum and a maximum distance for the gas following blustin et al .",
    "the minimum distance is calculated with the assumption that the outflow velocity has to be greater or equal than the escape one , @xmath42 . for a m@xmath43=1.1@xmath44 m@xmath45 ( marchesini et al .",
    "2004 ) , and average outflow velocities of the order of 10@xmath4 km  s@xmath3 ( see table 1 ) we deduce that the gas should be located at a distance larger than 10 pc . on the other hand ,",
    "the maximum distance of the gas can be obtained by combining the ionisation parameter and the column density .",
    "if the gas is confined in a thin layer ( @xmath46 with @xmath47 the layer depth ) , and the volume filling factor equal to 1 , it turns out that @xmath48  pc . according to ghisellini & tavecchio ( 2008 ) the blr and torus radii",
    "are expected to scale with the square root of the disk luminosity : @xmath49@xmath50  cm and @xmath51  cm ( cleary et al . 2007 ) .",
    "thus for 3c  382 we can estimate typical sizes for the blr and dusty torus region , i.e. r@xmath520.06  pc and r@xmath531.5  pc if l@xmath54 .",
    "these results suggest that the bulk of the highly ionised absorption gas , detected in 3c  382 , is located beyond the torus , most likely in the nlr .",
    "interestingly , we note that this is also the probable location of the photoionised emitting gas observed in 3c  33 ( torresi et al .",
