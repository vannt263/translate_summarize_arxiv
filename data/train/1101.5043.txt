    "the kinetics of many chemical reactions is influenced by the transport properties of the reactants that they involve @xcite .",
    "in fact , schematically , any chemical reaction requires first that a given reactant a meets a second reactant b. this first reaction step can be rephrased as a search process involving a searcher a looking for a target b. in a very dilute regime , exemplified by biochemical reactions in cells @xcite which sometimes involve only a few copies of reactants , the targets b are sparse and therefore hard to find in this search process language .",
    "in such reactions , the first step of search for reactants b is therefore a limiting factor of the global reaction kinetics . in the general aim of enhancing the reactivity of chemical systems ,",
    "it is therefore needed to optimize the efficiency of this first step of search .",
    "recently , it has been shown that intermittent processes , combining slow diffusion phases with a faster transport , can significantly increase reactions rates @xcite .",
    "a minimal model demonstrating the efficiency of this type of search , introduced to account for the fast search of target sequences on dna by proteins @xcite is as follows ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the pathway followed by the protein , considered as a point - like particle , is a succession of 1d diffusions along the dna strand ( called sliding phases ) with diffusion coefficient @xmath0 and 3d excursions in the surrounding solution .",
    "the time spent by the protein on dna during each sliding phase is assumed to follow an exponential law with dissociation rate @xmath1 . in this minimal model ,",
    "the 3d excursions are uncorrelated in space , which means that after dissociation from dna , the protein will rebind the dna at a random position independently of its starting position . assuming further that the mean duration of such 3d excursions @xmath2 is finite , it has been shown that the mean first - passage time at the target can be minimized as a function of @xmath3 , as soon as the mean time spent in bulk excursions is not too long .",
    "quantitatively , this condition writes in orders of magnitude as @xmath4 , and the minimum of the search time is obtained for @xmath5 in the large @xmath6 limit .",
    "note that in this minimal model , where the time @xmath2 is supposed to be a fixed exterior parameter , bulk phases are always beneficial in the large @xmath6 limit ( i.e. allow one to decrease the search time with respect to the situation corresponding to 1d diffusion only ) .    in many practical situations however , the duration of the fast bulk excursions strongly depends on the geometrical properties of the system @xcite and can not be treated as an independent variable as assumed in the mean - field ( mf ) model introduced above .",
    "an important generic situation concerns the case of confined systems @xcite , involving transport of reactive molecules both in the bulk of a confining domain and on its boundary , referred to as surface - mediated diffusion in what follows .",
    "this type of problems is met in situations as varied as heterogeneous catalysis @xcite , or reactions in porous media and in vesicular systems @xcite . in all these examples ,",
    "the duration of bulk excursions is controlled by the return statistics of the molecule to the confining surface , which crucially depends on the volume of the system .",
    "this naturally induces strong correlations between the starting and ending points of bulk excursions , and makes the above mf assumption of uncorrelated excursions largely inapplicable in these examples .    at the theoretical level",
    ", the question of determining mean first - passage times in confinement has attracted a lot of attention in recent years for discrete random walks @xcite and continuous processes @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the surface - mediated diffusion problem considered here generalizes the so - called narrow escape problem , which refers to the time needed for a simple brownian motion in absence of surface diffusion to escape through a small window of an otherwise reflecting domain .",
    "this problem has been investigated both in the mathematical @xcite and physical @xcite literature , partly due to the challenge of taking into account mixed boundary conditions .",
    "the case of surface - mediated diffusion brings the additional question of minimizing the search time with respect to the time spent in adsorption , in the same spirit as done for intermittent processes introduced above . the answer to",
    "this question is _ a priori _ not clear , since the mean time spent in bulk excursions diverges for large confining domains , so that the condition of minimization mentioned previously can not be taken as granted , even in the large system limit . in this context",
    ", first results have been obtained in @xcite where , surprisingly enough , it has been found that , even for bulk and surface diffusion coefficients of the same order of magnitude , the reaction time can be minimized , whereas mf treatments ( see for instance @xcite ) predict a monotonic behavior .    here",
    ", we extend the perturbative results of @xcite obtained in the small target size limit . relying on an integral equation approach",
    ", we provide an exact solution for the mean fpt , both for 2d an 3d spherical domains , and for any spherical target size .",
    "we also develop approximation schemes , numerically validated , that provide more tractable expressions of the mean fpt .",
    "the surface - mediated process under study is defined as follows .",
    "we consider a molecule diffusing in a spherical confining domain of radius @xmath7 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) , alternating phases of boundary diffusion ( with diffusion coefficient @xmath0 ) and phases of bulk diffusion ( with diffusion coefficient @xmath8 ) . the time spent during each one - dimensional phase",
    "is assumed to follow an exponential law with dissociation rate @xmath1 . at each desorption event , the molecule is assumed to be ejected at a distance @xmath9 from the frontier ( otherwise it is instantaneously readsorbed ) . although formulated for any value of this parameter @xmath9 smaller than @xmath7 , in most physical situations of real interest @xmath10 .",
