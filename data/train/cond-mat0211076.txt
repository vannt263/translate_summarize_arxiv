    "the theory of electronic structure and magnetism of solids historically was split into two distinct parts , namely , the model investigations of many - body effects and the calculations of the energy spectra and properties of specific compounds in the framework of density functional ( df ) scheme @xcite .",
    "recently , within the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft , for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) the correlation effects have been incorporated into realistic electronic structure calculations [ 4 - 10 ] .",
    "this method has been successfully applied to a number of classical problems of solid state physics such as the finite - temperature magnetism of iron - group metals @xcite , @xmath1 transition in plutonium @xcite , electronic structure of doped mott insulators @xcite .",
    "in contrast with standard df theory , in this new approach known as `` lda+dmft '' @xcite or `` lda++ '' @xcite the total energy of the system ( or , more accurately , the thermodynamic potential @xmath2 ) is considered as a functional of the green function instead of the denstity matrix @xcite . to stress this new feature more explicitely we will use the term `` spectral density functional ( sdf ) '' .",
    "the analytical properties of the green function garantee that the knowlegde of the spectral density is equivalent to the knowledge of the time - dependent green function whereas the density matrix is just static value of the latter @xcite . here we will describe the basic ideas of the sdf method , both in the framework of a standard dmft and from a more general point of view , discuss possible cluster generalizations of the dmft , and consider the applications of sdf to correlation effects and magnetism in transition metals .",
    "a most economical approach to unifying the various dynamical mean - field approximations in use , is provided by the effective action construction @xcite .",
    "the idea is to select a set of variables which is relevant to the physics of the problem and to write down a functional of the relevant variables .",
    "the extremum of this functional yields the values of those variables in equilibrium , and the value of this functional at stationarity gives the free energy of the system in equilibrium .",
    "density functional theory is the simplest example of this construction @xcite , here the total energy of the solid is expressed in terms of the density of the electrons .",
    "another well tested example is the spin density functional theory in which the total energy is expressed in terms of the spin and charge densities .",
    "the construction of an explicit expression of the exact effective - action functional is usually not available except for the case of very simple examples and the success of the method relies on the availability of good approximations to this functional .",
    "the lda and the lsda approaches have been extraordinarily successful for weakly correlated systems .",
    "the dynamical mean - field approach to model hamiltonians of strongly correlated systems on a lattice can also be brought to such an effective action perspective .",
    "more important this construction can be easily generalized to incorporate the so - called extended dynamical mean - field approach ( e - dmft ) @xcite , by constructing an effective action for both the local green function and the local density - density and local spin - spin autocorrelation function .",
    "the effective - action approach also allows the formulation of the e - dmft approach in the case where spatial and spin or charge symmetries are broken .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the effective - action approach , allows us a simple combination of the density functional theory and the dmft . by legendre transformation techniques one can construct a functional of the density and of the local spectral function of the heavy orbitals",
    "whose extremization would yield the exact density local spectral function of the heavy orbitals , and the total energy of the system . again",
    "the exact form of this functional are not known in explicit form , but useful approximations to it are available , and can be used to study interesting problems .",
    "this realistic dmft , lda+dmft approach or lda++ approach , was first implemented ignoring the coupling between the density and the local spectral function .",
    "this amounts to performing first a lda calculation to derive a tight - binding model hamiltonian , and then performing a dmft calculation for the spectra of the dmft hamiltonian .",
    "this is very close in spirit to the philosphy of model hamiltonian calculations .",
    "recently a full implementation of the self - consistent determination of the density and the local spectra was carried out by s. savrasov @xcite , and this is now closer in spirit to traditional first - principles electronic structure calculations .    the effective action approach , can be generalized to clusters , if short - range correlations need to be taken into account . in the context of model hamiltonians , a functional of the restriction of the green function to a given cluster is defined .",
    "the extremization of this functional give rise to cluster dynamical mean field equations .",
    "there is no difficulty in constructing hybrid funtionals for the self - consistent determination of both the density and the cluster green functions , namely a cdmft+lda method .    in the next section",
    "we motivate the approximate dmft form of those functionals from a perspective of a reduced fermionic description .",
    "in the sdf approach two - electron subsytems are introduced , one of them is described by the standard df theory ( usually this is the subsystem of @xmath3-electrons ) and dynamical interelectron correlations are taken into account for the another one ( usually this is the subsystem of @xmath4- or @xmath5-electrons ) .",
    "further simplifications can be connected with the local form of interelectron interactions ( only hubbard - type on - site electron correlations are considered ) , using some approximations like dmft or its cluster generalizations @xcite , etc . from a general point of view",
    "all these approaches can be considered as specific cases of a `` coarse graining '' ( reduced description ) ideology @xcite when all the variables describing the system can be separated into the `` gross '' and `` slave '' variables ; the only assumption that a closed set of the equations of motion for the gross variables exist is sufficient to find an explicit form of these equations @xcite . here",
    "we demonstrate the coarse graining procedure for fermionic degrees of freedom for the system of interacting electrons in a crystal .",
    "let us start with the functional integral over the grassman creation and annihilation electron fields @xmath6 , where the `` measure '' is @xmath7 ,    @xmath8 + s_{int}\\left [ c^{+},c\\right ]   \\label{action}\\ ] ]    here @xmath9 is the chemical potential , @xmath10 is the inverse temperature , and @xmath11 is the `` one - particle '' part of the hamiltonian . in the sdf approach @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the kohn - sham self - consistent potential @xcite .    in the spirit of a reduced description approach",

    "it is sometimes stated in the literature that this assumption violates the translational invariance of the system .",
    "the effective - action approach , is meant to construct a functional of the selected variables , so by construction it is not possible to discuss within this framework the issue of translation invariance .",
    "the `` self - consistency condition '' does the best possible job within a gaussian approximation to restore the equivalence of the central site and the medium .",
    "we show below that this reasoning in a cluster setting leads to the `` cellular dmft '' approach @xcite . in principle , the correlations between the gross and slave variables ( e.g. , the long - range part of the coulomb interaction ) also can be taken into account in a close analogy with the classical spin models @xcite ; the corresponding modification of the dmft approach will be considered elsewhere . in accordance with the general scheme of the non - equilibriun statistical operator method @xcite , we add an `` auxiliary field '' conjugated to the green function of the gross variables , namely , the term @xmath28 . these fields will restore the translational invariance for the fermionic green function ( see below , eq.([equal ] ) ) .    calculating the gaussian integral over @xmath29 one",

    "formal analogies between eqs.([densfun ] ) and ( [ sdf ] ) , ( [ ks ] ) and ( [ var ] ) are obvious : the self - energy plays the role of the kohn - sham potential ( without the external potential ) and the green function plays the role of the density matrix . as an example of this correspondence one can prove @xcite in the framework of the sdf an useful identity known as the `` local force theorem '' basically in the same way as it has been done within df theory @xcite .    for both parts of the thermodynamic potential , @xmath57 and @xmath81 the local force theorem",

    "most of real applications of the sdf approach are connected with the single - site dynamical mean field theory . at the same time , for a number of problems this can be insufficient and some generalizations to take into account the non - local effects are necessary , for example , cluster ones .",
    "the first attempts of such generalizations are already leading to some interesting results in the theory of high - t@xmath0 superconductivity @xcite but a lot of additional work is required in the area of cluster dynamical mean field theories to reach the level of understanding that was reached in single site dmft .",
