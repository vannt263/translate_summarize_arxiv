    "the study of complete , properly embedded minimal surfaces in @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is complete riemannian @xmath6-manifold , was initiated by harold rosenberg in @xcite .",
    "the general theory of such surfaces was further developed by meeks and rosenberg in  @xcite . in the case of @xmath1 , if such a surface has finite topology , then either it is a union of horizontal spheres @xmath7 , or else it is conformally a connected , twice - punctured , compact riemann surface , with one end going up and the other end going down  @xcite*theorems  3.3 ,  4.2 ,  5.2 .",
    "in that same paper , rosenberg described a class of such surfaces in @xmath8 that are very similar to helicoids in @xmath3 , and hence are also called helicoids .",
    "they may be characterized as the complete , non - flat minimal surfaces in @xmath1 whose horizontal slices are all great circles .",
    "( see section  [ helicoid - guide - section ] for a more explicit description of helicoids in @xmath1 and for a discussion of their basic properties . )",
    "he went on to construct for each genus a minimal surface in @xmath1 whose two ends are asymptotic to a totally geodesic cylinder .    in this paper",
    "we prove the existence of properly embedded minimal surfaces in @xmath8 of prescribed finite topology , with top and bottom ends asymptotic to an end of a helicoid of any prescribed pitch .",
    "( the pitch of a helicoid in @xmath8 is defined in section  [ helicoid - guide - section ] .",
    "the absolute value of the pitch is twice the vertical distance between successive sheets of the helicoid .",
    "the sign of the pitch depends on the sense in which the helicoid winds about its axes . )",
    "although the pitch of the helicoid to which the top end is asymptotic equals pitch of the helicoid to which the bottom is asymptotic , we do not know if these two helicoids coincide ; one might conceivably be a vertical translate of the other .",
    "each of the surfaces we produce contains a pair of antipodal vertical lines @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( called axes of the surface ) and a horizontal great circle @xmath11 that intersects each of the axes . indeed , for each our surfaces , there is a helicoid whose intersection with the surface is precisely @xmath12 .    for every genus , our method produces two examples that are not congruent to each other by any orientation - preserving isometry of @xmath8 .",
    "the two examples are distinguished by their behavior at the origin @xmath13 : one is  positive \" at @xmath13 and the other is  negative \" at @xmath13 .",
    "( the positive / negative terminology is explained in section  [ sign - section ] . )",
    "if the genus is odd , the two examples are congruent to each other by reflection @xmath14 in the totally geodesic cylinder consisting of all points equidistant from the two axes .",
    "if the genus is even , the two examples are not congruent to each other by any isometry of @xmath8 , but each one is invariant under the reflection @xmath14 .",
    "the examples of even genus @xmath15 are also invariant under @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are antipodal points in @xmath2 , so their quotients under this involution are genus-@xmath0 minimal surfaces in @xmath19 with helicoidal ends .    for each genus @xmath0 and for each helicoidal pitch , we prove that as the radius of the  @xmath2 tends to infinity , our examples converge subsequentially to complete , properly embedded minimal surfaces in @xmath3 that are asymptotic to helicoids at infinity . in general , some of the handles will drift off to infinity . indeed , a priori , the limiting surface might have genus @xmath20 even if @xmath0 is large .",
    "however , in the companion paper @xcite , we show that when @xmath0 is even , we can ensure that exactly half of the handles drift away .",
    "it follows that @xmath3 contains properly embedded , helicoidal minimal surfaces of every genus .    the arguments required to keep too many handles from drifting away are rather delicate .",
    "it is much easier to control whether the limiting surface has odd or even genus : a limit ( as the radius of @xmath2 tends to infinity ) of `` positive '' examples must have even genus and a limit of `` negative '' examples must have odd genus . such parity control is sufficient ( without the delicate arguments of  @xcite ) to give a new proof of the existence of a genus - one helicoid in @xmath3 .",
    "previous proofs were given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "see the corollary to theorem  [ theorem2 ] in section  [ section : main - theorems ] for details",
    ".    returning to our discussion of examples in @xmath8 , we also prove existence of what might be called periodic genus-@xmath0 helicoids .",
    "they are properly embedded minimal surfaces that are invariant under a screw motion of @xmath1 and that have fundamental domains of genus @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , our nonperiodic examples in @xmath1 are obtained as limits of the periodic examples as the period tends to infinity .    as mentioned above ,",
    "all of our examples contain two vertical axes @xmath21 and a horizontal great circle @xmath22 at height @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath23 be the great circle at height @xmath20 such that @xmath11 , @xmath23 , and @xmath9 meet orthogonally at a pair of points @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "all of our examples are invariant under @xmath26 rotation about @xmath11 , @xmath23 , and @xmath9 ( or , equivalently , about @xmath10 : rotations about @xmath9 are also rotations about @xmath10 ) .",
    "in addition , the nonperiodic examples ( and suitable fundamental domains of the periodic examples ) are what we call  @xmath23-surfaces \" .",
    "intuitively , this means that they are @xmath27-invariant ( where @xmath27 is @xmath26 rotation about @xmath23 ) and that the handles ( if there are any ) occur along @xmath23 .",
    "the precise definition is that @xmath27 acts by multiplication by @xmath28 on the first homology group of the surface .",
    "this property is very useful because it means that when we let the period of the periodic examples tend to infinity , the handles can not drift away : they are trapped along @xmath23 , which is compact . in the companion paper  @xcite ,",
    "when we need to control handles drifting off to infinity as we let the radius of the @xmath2 tend to infinity , the @xmath23-surface property means that the handles can only drift off in one direction ( namely along @xmath23 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ helicoid - guide - section ] , we present the basic facts about helicoids in @xmath1 . in section  [ section : main - theorems ] , we state the main results of this paper and the companion paper  @xcite . in section  [ sign - section ]",

    ", we prove that as the radius of the @xmath2 tends to infinity , our nonperiodic genus-@xmath0 helicoids in @xmath1 converge to properly embedded , minimal surfaces in @xmath3 with helicoidal ends .",
    "in @xmath1 , fix a point @xmath13 in @xmath30 and let @xmath9 be the vertical line through @xmath13 . define @xmath31 to be the screw motion of @xmath1 given by clockwise rotation through angle @xmath32 about @xmath9 followed by vertical translation by @xmath33 .",

    "the helicoid @xmath38 contains two _ axes _ , the vertical lines @xmath9 and @xmath41 .",

    "if that symmetry is denoted by @xmath43 , then we have @xmath44 . if @xmath45 is the mean curvature of @xmath38 at @xmath17 , then @xmath46 .",
    "but since @xmath43 interchanges the components of @xmath47 , @xmath48 . hence @xmath49 . since @xmath17 is an arbitrary point on the helicoid @xmath50 , it is a minimal surface .",

    "these great circles @xmath54 are orthogonal to @xmath38 and the rotational symmetries around them are called _ normal symmetries of @xmath38_. in @xmath3 the horizontal lines through the axis @xmath9 that meet a helicoid orthogonally are also lines of rotational symmetry .    as @xmath55",

    "( we consider such cylinders to be degenerate helicoids . )",
    "this is directly analogous to what happens in @xmath3 , where the convergence as @xmath61 is to a lamination by horizontal planes with the @xmath62-axis as singular set and the convergence as @xmath63 is to a vertical plane .",
    "there are some important differences .",
    "first , as we have seen , helicoids in @xmath1 have _ two _ axes , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , not just one .",
    "second , any two helicoids in @xmath3 with positive pitch differ by a rigid motion followed by a homothety . but in @xmath1 there are no homotheties ; helicoids with different pitches are essentially different surfaces .",
    "third , helicoids in @xmath1 have a symmetry of reflection not possessed by helicoids in @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath64 be the great circle of points equidistant from @xmath13 and @xmath35 .",
    "( thus @xmath65 is the equator with poles @xmath13 and @xmath35 . )",
    "then it is easy to see that any helicoid with axes @xmath9 and @xmath10 is invariant under the reflection @xmath14 in the flat totally geodesic cylinder @xmath66 .",
    "finally , note that a helicoid in @xmath1 is topologically an annulus and conformally a twice punctured sphere , while a helicoid in @xmath3 is simply connected and conformally a once - punctured sphere .      as noted above , if @xmath34 and @xmath54 are two great circles in @xmath67 , it easy to see that @xmath38 and @xmath68 differ by an ambient isometry of @xmath1 .",
    "we will fix our choice of base circles for the remainder of this paper : let x and y be two great circles in @xmath67 that meet orthogonally at points @xmath13 and @xmath35 , and let @xmath9 and @xmath69 be the vertical geodesics through @xmath13 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
