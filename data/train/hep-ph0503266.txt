    "the search for @xmath3new  physics ( np ) beyond the standard model ( sm ) has become one of the hottest topics of the current decade . in most extensions of the sm , new scalar ( cp - even ) and pseudoscalar ( cp - odd ) states appear in the physical spectrum . while the masses of these particles should be typically of the same order as the weak scale , if the theory possesses a global symmetry its spontaneous breakdown gives rise to a massless goldstone boson , the @xmath3axion  , originally introduced in the framework of a two - higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) @xcite to solve the strong cp problem .",
    "however , such an axial u(1 ) symmetry is anomalous and the pseudoscalar acquires a ( quite low ) mass ruled out experimentally . on the other hand ,",
    "if the global symmetry is explicitly ( but slightly ) broken , one expects a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson in the theory which , for a range of model parameters , still can be significantly lighter than the other scalars .    in the next to minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) , where a new singlet superfield is added to the higgs sector to solve the so - called @xmath4-problem @xcite , the mass of the lightest cp - odd higgs can be naturally small due to a global symmetry of the higgs potential only softly broken by trilinear terms .",
    "this model has received considerable attention and the associated phenomenology should be examined with great care in different experimental environments @xcite . for example , it is likely that a sm - like higgs boson would decay into two ( possibly ) much lighter pseudoscalar higgses presenting difficulties for detection at the lhc @xcite .    also _ little higgs _ models can naturally lead to the existence of light pseudoscalars ( not absorbed as longitudinal components of @xmath5 states ) on account of spontaneously broken @xmath6 subgroups @xcite . moreover , there are other scenarios containing a light higgs which could have escaped detection in the searches performed at lep - ii @xcite , e.g. a mssm higgs sector with explicit cp violation @xcite .",
    "another example is a minimal composite higgs scenario @xcite where the lower bound on the cp - odd scalar mass is quite loose , as low as @xmath7 mev ( from astrophysical constraints ) . on the other hand , it has been extensively argued in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) that a light pseudoscalar higgs should be required ( in a two - loop calculation ) to account for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon .",
    "long time ago , the authors of references @xcite pointed out the possibility of detecting a light higgs particle in quarkonium decays . recently , in a series of papers @xcite , this investigation has been followed further by considering a possible np contribution to the leptonic decays of @xmath8 resonances ( see figure 1 ) below @xmath9 threshold via the decay mode : @xmath10 where @xmath11 stands for a soft ( undetected ! ) photon and @xmath12 denotes a ( real or virtual ) non - standard light cp - odd higgs boson .",
    "our later development is based upon the following keypoints :    * such a np contribution would be unwittingly ascribed to the leptonic branching fraction : @xmath13 $ ] of the upsilon .",
    "notice that the experimental determination of the leptonic width does include soft photons either from the initial- or final - state @xcite * a leptonic ( squared ) mass dependence of the decay width ( stemming from the higgs contribution ) would lead to an @xmath3apparent  lepton universality breakdown",
    ". actually , only in the tauonic channel would this np contribution significantly alter the measured branching fraction ( bf ) , as we shall later show .",
    "let us also note that those @xmath14 decays breaking lepton universality within the sm ( like a direct @xmath15-exchange annihilation or a two - photon ( one - loop ) annihilation of an intermediate @xmath0 state ) are negligible @xcite    the electromagnetic decay width of the @xmath8 resonance into a dilepton as a first approximation is given by @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the electromagnetic fine structure constant ; @xmath18 denotes the mass of initial - state vector resonance , @xmath19 its non - relativistic radial wave function at the origin ; @xmath20 is the charge of the relevant ( bottom ) quark ( @xmath21 in units of @xmath22 ) ; @xmath23 is a ( smoothly ) decreasing function of @xmath24 with @xmath25 the lepton mass .    in order to check our conjecture by assessing the relative importance of the postulated np contribution",

    "a ( statistically significant ) non - null value of @xmath28 would imply the rejection of lepton universality ( predicting @xmath29 ) and a strong argument supporting the existence of a pseudoscalar higgs boson mediating the tauonic channel as shown in eq .",

    "nevertheless , we can conclude that those results do nt preclude the possibility of a @xmath34 breaking of lepton universality ( i.e. @xmath35 ) .",
    "forthcoming data from cleo on - going analisis will definitely settle this point , , @xmath33 and @xmath36 resonances are available from cleo ( not used in table 1 ) but not the tauonic bf yet @xcite ] thus checking our conjecture .    for theoretical estimates we will assume that fermions couple to the @xmath12 field according to the interaction term @xmath37 in the effective lagrangian , with @xmath38 gev ; @xmath39 depends on the fermion type , whose mass is denoted by @xmath40 . in what follows , we will focus on a 2hdm of type ii @xcite : @xmath41 for down - type fermions where @xmath42 stands for the ratio of two higgs doublets vacuum expectation values .",

    "large values of @xmath42 would imply a large coupling of the @xmath12 to the bottom quark but a small coupling to the charm quark .",
    "this fact has crucial phenomenological consequences in our proposal as a higgs - mediated contribution would only affect bottomonium decays but not charmonium decays .",

    "in this section we deal with different higgs - mediated decay channels , either on the @xmath3continuum  i.e. without formation of bound @xmath31 states subsequent to the photon emission in process ( 1 ) , or via intermediate @xmath0 states .",
    "we will consider both off - shell and on - shell higgs production according to whether the higgs mass is greater or smaller than the decaying upsilon mass , respectively .",
    "let us perform a perturbative calculation of the three body decay @xmath44 on the @xmath3continuum  by writing the decay width as the integral over phase space @xmath45= \\frac{1}{32m_{\\upsilon}^3}\\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^3}\\ \\times\\    \\int | { \\cal a}(\\upsilon(ns)\\to\\gamma\\ \\ell^+\\ell^-)|^2\\ dm_{\\ell\\ell}^2\\   dm_{\\ell\\gamma}^2\\ ] ] with @xmath46|^2 =   \\frac{64m_{\\ell\\ell}^2 m_b^2\\alpha q_b^2|r_n(0)|^2 \\tan^4\\beta } { m_{\\upsilon}[m_{\\ell\\ell}^2-m_{a^0}^2]^2v^4}\\ \\times m_{\\ell}^2\\ ] ] under the assumption that @xmath47 , i.e. no on - shell production of the cp - odd higgs boson is kinematically allowed , we carry out the phase space integration in eq .",

    "the decay width of a @xmath96 resonance into a tauonic pair via a cp - even higgs boson is @xcite @xmath97= \\frac{27m_b^2m_{\\tau}^2(1 - 4x_{\\ell})^{3/2}|r'_n(0)|^2\\tan{}^4\\beta } { 8\\pi^2(m_{\\chi_{b0}}^2-m_{a^0}^2)^2v^4}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 denotes the derivative of the @xmath99 radial wave function at the origin , yielding @xmath100 \\simeq 20 $ ] kev for @xmath101 gev@xmath102 @xcite , @xmath91 and @xmath103 gev as reference values . in order to get a branching fraction estimate ,",

    "the existence of a light higgs boson can have consequences besides altering the tauonic decay rate of upsilon resonances .",
    "indeed , the mixing of the @xmath12 with a pseudoscalar resonance could modify the properties of both @xcite .",
    "in particular , the resulting mass shift of the @xmath0 state might cause a disagreement between the experimental determination of the @xmath1 hyperfine splittings and theoretical predictions based on quark potential models , lattice nrqcd or pnrqcd @xcite .",

    "a caveat is thus in order : a quite large @xmath119 difference may lead to an unrealistic m1 transtion rate requiring smaller @xmath42 values , in turn inconsistently implying a smaller mass shift ; hence no hyperfine splitting greater than @xmath120 mev should be expected on these grounds .    on the other hand",
    ", broad @xmath0 states would be possible due to the np contribution , notably for large @xmath42 values .",
    "thus one can speculate why no evidence of hindered m1 radiative decays of higher upsilon resonances into @xmath64 and @xmath63 states was found in the search performed by cleo @xcite .",
    "the corresponding signal peak ( which should appear in the photon energy spectrum ) could be considerably smoothed - in addition to the spreading from the experimental measurement - and thereby might not be significantly distinguished from the background ( arising primarly from @xmath121 s ) .",
    "of course , the matrix elements for hindered transitions are expected to be small and difficult to predict as they are generated by relativistic and finite size corrections .",
    "nevertheless , most of the theoretical calculations ( see a compilation in ref.@xcite ) are ruled out by cleo results ( at least ) at @xmath122 cl , though substancially lower rates are obtained in @xcite where exchange currents play an essential role and therefore can not be currently excluded .",
    "large widths of @xmath0 resonances would also bring negative effects for their detection in hadron colliders like the tevatron through the decay modes : @xmath123 @xcite , and the recently proposed @xmath124 @xcite , as the respective branching fractions would drop by about one order of magnitude with respect to the sm calculations",
    "it has been pointed out in the literature @xcite that cp violation in the higgs sector of the mssm can occur quite naturally , representing an interesting option to generate cp violation beyond the sm .",
    "then , the three neutral mssm higgs bosons could mix together and the resulting three physical mass eigenstates @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) would have mixed parities . under this scenario ,",
    "higgs couplings to the @xmath127 boson would vary ; the @xmath128 coupling can be significantly suppressed @xcite thus raising the possibility of a relatively light @xmath129 boson having escaped detection at lep 2 for the range @xmath130 ( higher values of @xmath42 were not considered in the search ) .",
    "interestingly , for several choices of model parameters and a higgs mass about 10 gev , the region of @xmath42 not excluded experimentally by lep searches @xcite is in accordance with the requirements found in this work to give rise to a @xmath34 breakdown of lepton universality in @xmath14 decays .",
    "finally notice that the @xmath129 higgs boson can couple both to scalar and pseudocalar states .",
    "hence the @xmath96 resonances might play a role as intermediate states in @xmath33 and @xmath36 decays : @xmath131 , as mentioned in section 2.3 for a cp - even higgs boson .",
    "heavy quarkonium physics has reached a level of maturity enabling the search for new phenomena beyond the sm @xcite . in this paper , possible hints of new physics in bottomonium systems and suggestions to conduct an experimental search for new evidence",
    "have been pointed out :    * current experimental data do not preclude the possibility of lepton universality breaking at a significance level of @xmath132 @xcite , interpreted in terms of a light cp - odd higgs boson for a reasonable range of @xmath42 values in a 2hdm(ii ) .",
    "in fact , direct searches at lep do nt exclude a non - standard higgs boson for some regions of model parameters in different scenarios , notably in a cpx mssm @xcite and the nmssm @xcite * mixing between the cp - odd higgs and @xmath0 states can yield @xmath1 splittings larger than expected within the sm if @xmath133 ; the opposite if @xmath134 .",
    "furthermore , large @xmath0 widths would also be expected for large @xmath42 values .",
    "all that might explain the failure to find any signal from hindered @xmath33 and @xmath36 magnetic dipole transitions into @xmath0 states despite intensive searches performed at cleo @xcite .",
    "negative effects would also come up in the prospects to detect @xmath0 resonances in hadron colliders like the tevatron * after the recent results by cleo @xcite on the muonic bf of all three @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath36 resonances , new results for the tauonic bf from on - going cleo analysis are eagerly awaited .",
    "indeed , distinct degrees of lepton universality breaking ( if any ) in upsilon decays might lead to a higgs mass estimate as one expects that the closer the resonance mass to the mediating higgs boson mass is , the bigger np effect shows up in the tauonic bf * the detection of ( quasi)monoenergetic photons ( assuming a sharp intermediate @xmath0 state ) in @xmath34 events of the tauonic decay sample would represent the @xmath3smoking gun  of a higgs boson mediating the decay , allowing the determination of its mass",
    ". moreover , polarization studies of final - state @xmath135 in @xmath14 decays @xcite could help to establish also the cp quantum numbers of the higgs boson * on the contrary , if lepton universality in @xmath14 decays were confirmed , mass windows still open for a light higgs boson in scenarios beyond the sm could be closed in parameter regions hardly reachable by other experiments , e.g. those performed at hadron colliders @xcite .",
