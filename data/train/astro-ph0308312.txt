    "there is substantial evidence to indicate that the central regions of seyfert  1 active galactic nuclei ( agn ) consist of a geometrically - thin , optically - thick accretion disk surrounding a supermassive ( 10@xmath3@xmath4 ) black hole . in the leading models ,",
    "the inner disk is surrounded by a hot , optically - thin corona that compton - upscatters soft photons thermally emitted from the disk to produce an x - ray power - law continuum over the range 1100  kev , though the geometry of the corona remains uncertain ( e.g. , haardt , maraschi & ghisellini 1994 ) .",
    "furthermore , some optically thick material , such as the accretion disk , intercepts and reprocesses some of the x - rays , producing the so - called compton reflection hump above @xmath110  kev and a strong fe  k@xmath0   fluorescent emission line at 6.4  kev ( guilbert & rees 1988 , george & fabian 1991 ) . though the exact configuration of accreting material throughout the central engine is not known , the fe  k@xmath0  line , as a primary signature of the reprocessing , serves as a potential tool to trace the distribution of accreting gas .",

    "2002 ; ngc  5548 , nicastro et al .",
    "data above 18  kev were discarded as the source count rate became too low at higher energies to obtain a good detection in each time bin .",
    "all spectral fitting was done with xspec v.11.0.2 ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "most long - term observations spanned multiple gain epochs , requiring simultaneous fitting of data sets .    for all observations , the simple model of a power - law modified by cold absorption resulted in large residuals near 6  kev due to the fe  k@xmath0  line ; the addition of a emission component proved significant at greater than 99.99@xmath11 confidence in an f - test .",
    "given the limit of pca calibration ( data / model residuals @xmath122 - 3@xmath11response.ps ] , and the low energy resolution of the pca ( @xmath11  kev at 6  kev ) , the pca is largely insensitive to the detailed shape of the fe  k@xmath0  line .",

    "neutral absorption was kept fixed at the galactic value . for ngc  4151 ,",
    "modelling the column density with a value much higher than galactic resulted in a significant ( @xmath999.99@xmath11 confidence in an f - test ) improvement in the model fit .",

    "for all model fits except the short time scale observation of 3c  390.3 and the laor model fit to the short time scale observation of ngc  3516 , there were residuals above 10  kev that signalled the need to incorporate a compton reflection hump .",
    "including a pexrav component to model reflection of an underlying power law component off optically thick and neutral material ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) provided the necessary improvement to the fits , significant at greater than 99@xmath11 confidence compared to models with just a power - law plus fe  k@xmath0  line , modified by cold absorption . in the pexrav component , the inclination angle of the reflector",
    "was kept fixed at 30@xmath8 , and the power - law cutoff energy was kept fixed at 100  kev .",
    "all element abundances were kept fixed at solar ; as noted by ve01 a change in fe abundance caused the absolute values of spectral fit parameters to change slightly , but the variability pattern , the focus of this paper , remained unchanged .",
    "the basic model thus used , a power - law component plus pexrav ( where applicable ) plus a parameterization for the fe  k@xmath0  line as described above , all modified by neutral absorption , gave reasonable fits to the data .",
    "the exceptional signal - to - noise in these time - averaged spectra invariably meant that systematic errors associated with the background modelling and spectral response of the pca dominated the uncertainties .",
    "consequently , finding a statistically acceptable time - averaged fit ( with @xmath18  @xmath1  1 ) was unlikely even if the model was representative of the instrinsic spectrum of the source .",
    "the data / model residuals seen were consistent with the limit of the pca calibration .",
    "tables  23 summarize the time - averaged fitting results for both the single - gaussian and laor models , respectively , on both time scales .",
    "while higher - resolution x - ray instruments can detect one or both of the fe  k@xmath0  broad and narrow components , the pca is sensitive only to the combined flux of the two components .",
    "recent _ xmm - newton _ model fits can provide insight as to which component , the broad or narrow , dominates the _ rxte_view in each object .",
    "( _ chandra - hetg _ can additionally constrain the narrow component but is mostly insensitive to the broad component . ) for instance , the equivalent width of the broad component has been measured to be much greater than that of the narrow component in both mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( wilms et al .",
    "2001 ) and ngc  3516 ( turner et al .",

    "the present _ rxte _  fits for ngc  4151 , for instance , indicated the narrowest line of the sample , consistent with emission far from the central black hole .",
    "the equivalent widths of the broad and narrow components in ngc  3783 are approximately equal ( blustin et al .",
    "2002 ) , indicating that emission from both the inner accretion disk and a more distant location is relevant in this source .",
    "the above models were then applied to the time - resolved data .",
    "spectral fits to time bins spanning gain epoch changes required simultaneous fitting of the two data sets .",
    "the fe  k@xmath0  line was always detected in each time bin , as the addition of a line emission component was significant at @xmath999@xmath11 confidence in an f - test for nearly every time bin ( in the single exception , the last time bin of the long time scale observation of ngc  5548 , it was significant only at 98.1@xmath11 confidence ) . while fitting the time - averaged models to their respective time - resolved spectra , it was not practical to thaw parameters such as the fe  k@xmath0   line profile shape ( line width in the single - gaussian models ; inner radius and emissivity index @xmath13 in the laor models ) or line peak energy , given the pca resolution and sensitivity . the f - test was used to determine which free parameters to include in the fit .",

    "as discussed by nandra et al .",

    "these errors are produced by combining the errors in the source with those of the modelled background .",
    "the software uses poisson statistics , estimated from a large quantity of background data , to estimate the background error . for short exposures , this results in an overestimate of background errors , which should typically be negligible compared to the error on the total ( source plus background ) rate . to better ascertain the variability of the measured spectral parameters ,",
    "the standard errors produced by the software were discarded and new 1@xmath25 errors were estimated based on the variability properties of the derived light curves .",

    "ve01 used simulations to validate the accuracy of these errors .",
    "these are conservative error estimates ; only trends in the light curves sustained over several time bins will exceed the expected error using this formulation .",
    "these errors are listed in table  5 for @xmath19 and @xmath28 and used hereafter .",
    "errors on values of @xmath23 within a time bin were determined from the 210  kev continuum light curve , using the mean flux error on the @xmath11  ks exposures in that time bin .",

    "the results of the laor model time - resolved fits showed identical variability patterns and nearly identical time - averaged values to the single - gaussian fits , and they are not plotted .",
    "this spectral fitting was performed keeping the value of @xmath20 fixed , i.e. with the normalization of the pexrav reflection component varying in sync with the normalization of the power - law .",
    "this was done as there was no formal statistical requirement to allow the value of @xmath20 to vary in the fits ; freezing @xmath20 also minimized the influence of this free parameter on measurement of @xmath19 and f@xmath21 . however , as the reflection continuum and fe  k@xmath0  line are likely to be produced in the same location ( e.g. , the accretion disk ) it would perhaps be expected that the reflection component tracks variations in the line rather than the power - law continuum .",
    "time - resolved spectral fitting was repeated with the normalization of the reflector tied to the f@xmath21instead .",
    "the resulting light curves of f@xmath21   were essentially the same as those with a fixed value of @xmath20 .",
    "fractional variability amplitudes ( @xmath2 ; e.g. , vaughan et al .  2003 , edelson et al .  2002 ) were measured to quantify the instrinsic variability amplitude relative to the mean count rate and in excess of the measurement noise in the continuum and line light curves ; @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total variance of the light curve , @xmath31 is the mean square error and @xmath32 is the mean count rate of @xmath33 total points .",
    "the error on @xmath2 is @xmath34 as discussed in vaughan et al .",
    "this error formulation estimates @xmath35 based on random errors in the data itself , and not due to random variations associated with red - noise processes .",
    "furthermore , these estimates are only an approximation to the true values of @xmath35 since the data errors used here instead have been estimated from the point - to - point variance .",
    "table  6 lists the continuum and line variability amplitudes .",
    "temporal cross - correlation functions were calculated for f@xmath36f@xmath21 , f@xmath36@xmath19 , and @xmath19f@xmath21 using both the discrete correlation function dcf ; edelson & krolik 1988 ) and the interpolated correlation function ( icf , white & peterson 1994 ) .",
    "icf lag uncertainties were calculated using the bootstrap method of peterson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ; however , this method often underestimates the true errors introduced by uneven sampling , e.g. , edelson et al .",
    "figures 3 and 4 and tables 79 show the cross - correlation results , where a positive shift denotes the first quantity leading the second .",
    "the dcf and icf time bins used were 1.0 and 0.5 times the time bin size in the time - resolved fits , respectively .",
    "one must be skeptical of cross - correlation analysis in these circumstances , however , due to the red - noise nature of the continuum and line fluxes ( as speculated below ) .",
    "cross - correlation between two unrelated red - noise noise light curves can randomly yield spurious correlations with higher than expected values of the correlation strength @xmath37 ( e.g. , welsh 1999 ) .",
    "for instance , the @xmath37  =  0.7 optical - to - x - ray lag in ngc  3516 claimed by maoz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) was not confirmed with additional data by maoz et al .",
    "combined with the fact that most of these light curves only have 1020 points , spurious correlations and anticorrelations , including those based on very few points ( i.e. , trends much shorter than the total duration ) , can arise .",
    "discarding peak lags greater than @xmath11/3 of the total duration can eliminate some of these spurious lags ; this has been done for the values reported in tables  79 and the functions plotted in figures  3 and 4 .",
    "however , as has been done in the present work , it is more practical to not trust any lag where @xmath37 is not very close to 1.0 , applying relatively more skepticism for lower values of @xmath37 .",
    "cross - correlation analysis of f@xmath36 and f@xmath21 in the short time scale observations yields peak correlation coefficients in the range 0.170.72 .",
    "these values do not readily convince us that the analysis has yielded believable correlations .",
    "for instance , the highest correlation coefficient , @xmath37  =  0.72 , arises in ngc  3783 , which only has 12 points and for which substantial variability in the line is not detected ( see table  4 ) .",
    "ngc  5548 , for which cross - correlation analysis yields the second - highest value of @xmath37 in the short time scale sample , is a similar situation : the reported lag is far from zero , based on only a handful of points , and one can not conclude that this is a reliable correlation robustly detected in excess of the long time scale red - noise variations present .",
    "it follows that the lag delays and lag errors listed in table  7 must also be regarded with a large dose of skepticism .    for long time scale",
    "f@xmath36f@xmath21 correlations , the values of @xmath37 lie in the range 0.450.87 .",
    "despite the presence of higher values of @xmath37 , however , caution is again warranted .",
    "for instance , as the continuum and line light curves are both dominated by large decreases in ngc  3516 and ngc  5548 , the resulting cross - correlation functions have moderately - high values of the correlation coefficient at nearly all lags tested , and the peak correlation coefficients do not provide evidence of a strong correlation `` in excess '' of this artefact . if there were an increase in the values of @xmath37 towards a particular time scale , this would indicate more of a physical relevance associated with that time scale .",
    "however , only three objects show an increase in their respective values of average dcf and icf @xmath37 towards longer time scales .",
    "@xmath19f@xmath21 cross - correlation functions show similar correlation coefficient values as the f@xmath36f@xmath21 cross - correlation functions . however , many cross - correlation functions between f@xmath36 and @xmath19 on both time scales yield higher values of @xmath37",
    ". the values of @xmath37 on short time scales span 0.540.92 ; those on long time scales span 0.310.94 ( 0.620.94 if ngc  4151 is excluded ) .",

    "source and background spectra were derived over the time intervals listed in table  10 with the goal of constructing light curves of the flux in each channel for at least @xmath120 points .",
    "in addition to the observations used in the above analysis , @xmath2 spectra were measured for an additional four objects on short time scales and five objects on long time scales ; the total of twelve observations on each time scale included nine objects common to both lists . because the pcu gain settings changed three times since launch and",

    "it is therefore plausible to conclude that , at least on the time scales probed herein , the iron line variability is , like the continuum variability , a red - noise process .    the average maximum peak - to - trough line flux variation detected is a factor of @xmath12 for all observations ; typically , this is a factor of @xmath14.5 greater than the typical error bar .",

    "only a few observations show temporal trends in the line flux that mimic the continuum to at least some degree , and only on time scales of years . as discussed in @xmath74.3",
    ", however , the line varies less strongly than the continuum in many sources , as seen from a comparison of the spectral fit line and continuum flux light curve variability amplitudes as well as from a reduction in broadband @xmath2 near 6 kev seen in many sources @xmath2 spectra .",
    "the relationship between continuum and line variability is examined further in @xmath75.1 .",
    "the broadband spectral variability results are discussed in @xmath75.2 .",
    "this paper has demonstrated the presence of a range of variability behavior in the fe k@xmath0  line .",
    "the results permit tests of simple models in which the bulk of the continuum originates in a central corona and the line variations are driven solely by continuum flux fluctuations modified by light - travel time effects .",
    "for instance , such models imply that there should exist a connection between the origin of the line emission ( which can be inferred from the resolved profile shape ) and the presence of rapid line variability . if the bulk of the line is emitted in the inner accretion disk ( as implied by the broad line profiles in mcg6 - 30 - 15 and ngc  3516 ) , then the continuum and line variations should be correlated on time scales comparable to the light crossing time of the inner accretion disk .",
    "this is because the reprocessing times are likely very short compared to the light travel times , which dominate the correlation .",
    "however , the time bins used in this paper are typically at least two orders of magnitude longer than the expected light crossing time scale of the putative inner accretion disk .",
    "this means that any variations on this time scale would be grossly undersampled .",
    "if the bulk of the line is emitted far from the central corona ( e.g. , as implied by the narrow line profiles for ngc  4151 and ngc  5548 ) , then one would expect the line variations to track the continuum variations only on sufficiently long time scales ( e.g. , longer than days ",
    "weeks if the line is emitted in a region coincident with the broad line region ; kaspi et al .",
    "for instance , the presence of similar long - term trends in the continuum and line in ngc  5548 supports a model in which the bulk of the line emission originates far from the central corona in this object .",
    "more specifically , it is consistent with the prediction of yaqoob et al .",
    "( 2001 ) that the flux of the narrow core in ngc  5548 , estimated to originate in a region consistent with the broad line region in this object , should track the continuum flux on time scales of @xmath15    @xmath1100 days",
    ". however , such trends are not ubiquitous . for fe  k@xmath0  lines originating far from the central corona",
    ", one would expect to see an increase in number or strength of continuum  line correlations as one goes towards towards long time scales . however , there is no evidence from the current sample to support this .",
    "the lack of correlation between the continuum and the line suggests that modification to this straightforward picture is required .",
    "one possible explanation for the reduced variability in the line relative to the continuum is that a portion of line emission originating in the inner disk is absent or suppressed .",
    "the inner portions of the accretion disk may be truncated , highly ionized , or radiatively inefficient ( e.g. , as in an advection - dominated accretion flow ; narayan & yi 1994 ) .",
    "geometry may play a role : a relatively more concave disk , for instance , can reprocess a larger fraction of continuum photons in its outer regions ( blackman 1999 ) . for cases in which the bulk of the observed line flux originates in the outer disk , the direct response of the line peak to rapid continuum variations is reduced .",
    "another possibility is that if the x - ray continuum emission is produced in a corotating flare some height above the reflecting disk , then the orbital motions of the flare and disk can also lead to complex temporal behavior in the observed line flux ( ruszkowski 2000 ) .",
    "fabian & vaughan ( 2003 ) suggested that light - bending near the black hole can lead to substantial de - coupling of the observed continuum and line fluxes .",
    "this happens because much of the emission from the x - ray source is focussed on to the disc whereas only a small fraction is able to reach the observer .",
    "in such a scenario small changes in the geometry of the x - ray source can lead to relatively large changes in the amount of continuum radiation reaching the observer ( hence the strong continuum variations ) but relatively little change in the total amount of radiation illuminating the disk .",
    "another intriguing possibility relies on the presence of an ionized skin on the disk surface .",
    "thermal instabilities can lead to formation of such an ionized skin ( ross , fabian & young 1999 ; nayakshin , kazanas & kallman 2000 ) with most of the observed neutral line emission originating in the colder layers beneath .",
    "the ionized skin can scatter incoming continuum photons and outgoing line photons , affecting the observed neutral line flux , as discussed by nayakshin ( 2000 ) and nayakshin & kallman ( 2001 ) .",
    "however , changes in the ionization state of the skin are linked to the dynamic time scale for readjustment of hydrostatic equilibrium ( nayakshin & kazanas 2002 for a lamppost illuminating model ; see also collin et al .",
    "2003 for a multiple - flare illuminating model ) .",
    "this time scale is usually an order of magnitude or more larger than the light - crossing time ; this can be @xmath38minutes ",
    "hours if most of the line emission originates in the inner regions of a typical thin accretion disk ( e.g. , around a 10@xmath39  @xmath4 black hole ) .",
    "the observed line flux hence may not respond to continuum variations shorter than this time scale , resulting in decorrelation of the observed continuum and line flux variations .",
    "furthermore , the ionization state of the skin depends on the high - energy cutoff of the power - law continuum ( nayakshin & kallman 2001 ) ; this could be variable , but it is difficult to constrain with _",
    "rxte_. interestingly enough , such a variation in this parameter could lead to a change in fe  k@xmath0  line flux even without a change in 210  kev continuum flux .",
    "however , recent studies have not been able to directly link the line flux behavior with the ionization state of the disk , e.g. , ballantyne , vaughan & fabian ( 2003 ) .",
    "all of the above scenarios are still consistent with the prediction that both broad and narrow fe  k@xmath0  lines should eventually track continuum variations on time scales of months to years .",
    "the finding that the line decreased along with the continuum in the long time scale observation of ngc  5548 is consistent with this idea ; however , such correlated behavior is not seen throughout the entire sample . for line emission originating in the outer disk or molecular torus , ionization in the reflecting material",
    "is negligible due to the low x - ray continuum flux .",
    "however , other processes may be relevant for decorrelating long - term continuum and line variations .",
    "for instance , it may be possible for an ionized wind ( e.g. , george et al .",
    "1998 ) near the site of reflection to mimic an ionized skin in these regions .",
    "most of these objects show a strong correlation with no measureable lag between 210  kev continuum flux and photon index .",
    "additionally , @xmath2 spectra show that in nearly all the objects , the soft - spectrum ( narrow line ) source akn 564 being an exception , variability amplitudes tend to increase towards relatively softer energies .",
    "these observations show that the broadband emission steepens as it brightens , in line with numerous similar observations ( e.g. , magdziarz et al .",
    "1998 , done et al .",
    "2000 ) .",

    "data by shih , iwasawa & fabian ( 2002 ) and from _ xmm - newton _ data by fabian & vaughan ( 2003 ) point towards a scenario in which flux - correlated changes in the overall 210  kev continuum slope are explained by the superposition of a soft , variable power - law likely associated with coronal emission and a harder , much less variable spectral component likely associated with the compton reflection hump .",
    "taylor , uttley & mchardy ( 2003 ) use flux  flux plots to show that such a description of spectral variability works in mcg6 - 30 - 15 and ngc  3516 . specifically , in this model , the intrinsic slope of the underlying power - law does not vary significantly ; rather , it is the _ relative contributions _ of the two spectral components that change the overall spectral shape as observed .",
    "this model does not require physical properties of the power - law emitting corona such as electron temperature , optical depth , or flare size to vary significantly .",
    "furthermore , this two - component model may have relevance to explaining the observed fe  k@xmath0  variability . as the fe  k@xmath0  line and compton hump are expected to originate together , a relatively constant compton hump",
    "could be associated with variability in the fe  k@xmath0  line that is reduced relative to the continuum variability , as observed ( e.g. , shih et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "alternate models to explain the observed spectral variability rely on flux - correlated changes in the power - law slope of the coronal component . in the context of popular thermal comptonization corona models ( haardt , maraschi & ghisellini 1997 , poutanen & fabian 1999 ) , a flux  photon index correlation can arise if the x - ray variability is due to changes in the input seed photon population .",
    "in contrast to the two - component model above , some physical property of the corona may vary with the 210  kev x - ray flux in these types of models .",
    "the @xmath2 spectra of the soft - spectrum ( narrow - line ) seyfert  1 galaxy akn  564 display a much flatter dependence on energy in the 3.59  kev bandpass ( and may even be slightly increasing with energy on the long time scales ) relative to the other objects , most of which are hard - spectrum ( broad - line ) seyfert  1 galaxies .",

    "( 2002 ) as well as in other soft - spectrum sources ( vaughan et al .  2002 ) .",
    "this could imply that , in the context of the spectral - pivoting model above , the broadband spectral shape changes very little in soft - spectrum sources , perhaps due to the lack of variation of some physical parameter that does vary in broad - line seyfert  1 galaxies .",
    "alternatively , if the two - component model above is relevant , it is possible that soft - spectrum sources have much weaker hard / constant components , leading to relatively little change in the overall spectral shape with flux .",
    "overall , however , it is difficult to present a simple , unified phemonological model to simultaneously explain the dependence on energy of the variability in broad - line seyfert  1 galaxies and lack thereof in narrow - line seyfert  1 galaxies .",
    "time - resolved broadband spectral fitting has been systematically performed on near - continuous _ rxte _  monitoring data of seven seyfert  1 galaxies in order to probe the behavior of emission components on time scales of both @xmath1days to @xmath1weeks and @xmath1months to @xmath1years . fe k@xmath0  line variability is present at a variety of levels .",

    "furthermore , the fractional variability amplitude of the line increases towards longer time scales in many objects , `` tracking '' the red - noise continuum .",

    "<S> overall , however , there is no evidence for correlated variability between the line and continuum , severely challenging models in which the line tracks continuum variations modified only by a light - travel time delay . </S>",
    "<S> local effects such as the formation of an ionized skin at the site of line emission may be relevant . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral fitting and @xmath2 spectra both support spectral softening as continuum flux increases . </S>"
