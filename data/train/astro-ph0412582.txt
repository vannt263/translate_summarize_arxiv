    "ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) showers ( from pevs up to eevs and above , mainly of hadronic nature ) born at the high altitude in the atmosphere , may blaze ( from the far edge ) _ above the horizon _ toward telescopes such as magic one . the earliest gamma and cerenkov lights produced while they propagate through the atmosphere are severely absorbed because of the deep horizontal atmosphere column depth ( @xmath16 @xmath17 ) , must anyway survive and also revive : indeed additional diluted but penetrating muon bundles ( from the same by c.r .",
    "shower ) are decaying not far from the telescope into electrons which are source themselves of small cerenkov lights .",
    "also the same muon while hitting the telescope may blaze a ring or arc of cherenkov lights .",
    "these suppressed muon bundle secondaries , ( about @xmath18 times less abundant than the peak of the gamma shower photons ) are arising at high altitude , at an horizontal distances @xmath19 km far from the observer ( for a zenith angle @xmath20 while at 2.2 km .",
    "height ) ; therefore these hard ( tens - hundred gev ) muon shower bundles ( from ten to millions muons from tevs - eevs c.r .",
    "primary ) might spread in huge areas ( tens- hundred @xmath21 ) ; they are partially bent by geo - magnetic fields and they are randomly scattered , often decaying at tens - hundred gev energies , into electrons and consequent mini electromagnetic - showers traced by their optical cerenkov flashes .",
    "these diluted ( but spread and therefore better detectable ) brief ( nanosecond - microsecond ) optical signals may be captured as a cluster by largest telescope on ground as recent stereoscopic magic or hess , veritas arrays .",
    "their cerenkov flashes , single or clustered , must take place , at detection threshold , at least tens or hundreds times a night for magic - like telescope facing toward horizons @xmath22 .",
    "their `` guaranteed '' discover may offer a new tool in cr and uhecr detection .",
    "their primary hadronic signature might be hidden by the distance but its tail may arise in a new form by its secondary muon - electron - cerenkov of electromagnetic nature . on the same time _ below the horizons _ a more rare ( three - four order of magnitude ) but more exciting pev - eevs neutrino @xmath23 astronomy may arise by the earth - skimming horizontal tau air - showers ( hortaus ) ; these uhe taus are produced inside the earth crust by the primary uhe incoming neutrino @xmath6 , @xmath7 , generated mainly by their muon - tau neutrino oscillations from galactic or cosmic sources,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite . finally just above or below the horizon edge , within a few hundred of km distances",
    ", it might also be observable the guaranteed and well tuned @xmath24-@xmath25 air - showers at @xmath26 glashow resonant peak energy ; the w main hadronic ( @xmath27 ) or leptonic and electromagnetic ( @xmath28 ) signatures may be well observed and their rate might calibrate a new horizontal neutrino - multi - flavour astronomy @xcite .",
    "the @xmath24-@xmath25 of nearby nature ( respect to most far away ones at same zenith angle of hadronic nature ) would be better revealed by a stereoscopic magic twin telescope or a telescope array like hess , veritas .",
    "additional horizontal flashes might arise by cosmic uhe @xmath29 electromagnetic showers within most susy models , if uhecr are born in topological defect decay or in their annihilation , containing a relevant component of susy particles .",
    "the uhe @xmath29 behaves ( for light @xmath30 masses around z boson ones ) as the glashow resonant case @xcite .",
    "finally similar signals might be abundantly and better observed if uhe neutrinos share new extra - dimension ( tev gravity ) interactions : in this case also neutrino - nucleons interaction may be an abundant source of pevs - eevs horizontal showers originated in air @xcite .",
    "the total amount of air inspected within the solid angle @xmath31 by magic height at horizons ( @xmath32 km . ) exceed @xmath33 but their consequent detectable beamed volume are corresponding to an isotropic narrower volume : v@xmath34 @xmath35 , nevertheless comparable ( for pevs @xmath24-@xmath25 and eevs @xmath6 , @xmath36 showers ) to the present amanda confident volume .",
    "the ultrahigh energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) have been studied in the past mainly versus their secondaries ( @xmath1 , @xmath4 , @xmath3 ) collected vertically in large array detectors on the ground .",
    "this is due to the rare event rate of the uhecr in the atmosphere and due to the high altitude where the shower takes place , expand and amplify downward . on the contrary at the horizons the uhecr are hardly observable ( but also rarely looked for ) .",
    "they are diluted both by the larger distances as well as by the exponential atmosphere opacity suppressing the electromagnetic ( electron pairs and gamma ) secondaries ; also their rich optical cerenkov signal is partially suppressed by the horizontal air opacity .",
    "however this suppression acts also as a useful filter leading to the choose of higher cr events ; their cerenkov lights will be scatter and partially transmitted ( @xmath37 at @xmath38 nm .",
    ", @xmath39 at @xmath40 nm . ) depending on the exact zenith angle and seeing : assuming a suppression on average @xmath41 and the nominal magic threshold at @xmath42 gev gamma energy , it does corresponds to a hadronic shower at far horizons ( diluted by nearly three order of magnitude by larger distances ) at an energy above @xmath43 pev .",
    "their primary flux maybe estimated considering the known cosmic ray fluxes at same energy on the top of the atmosphere ( both protons or helium ) ( see dice experiment referred in@xcite ) : @xmath44 ; the consequent event rate spread within a shower cerenkov angle @xmath45 at a distance @xmath46 ( zenith angle @xmath47 ) corresponding to a wide shower area @xmath48 $ ] , observed by a opening angle @xmath49 $ ] is for a night of record ( @xmath50 $ ] ) : @xmath51 therefore one may foresee nearly every two minutes a far hadronic cerenkov lightening shower in magic facing at the far horizons at zenith angle @xmath52 . increasing the observer altitude h , the horizon zenith angle also grows : @xmath53 $ ] in analogy at a more distant horizontal edges ( standing at height @xmath54 as for magic , while observing at zenith angle @xmath55 still above the horizons ) the observation range @xmath56 increases : @xmath57 ; the consequent shower area widen by more than an order of magnitude ( and more than three order respect to vertical showers ) and the foreseen event number , now for much harder c.r . at @xmath58 , becomes : @xmath59 therefore at the far edges of the horizons @xmath60 , once a night , an uhecr around eev energies , blazes to the magic ( or hess , veritas , telescopes ) . at each of these far primary cherenkov flash",
    "is associated a long trail of secondary muons in a very huge area ; these muons eventually are also hitting inside the telescope disk ; their nearby showering , while decaying into electrons in flight , ( source of tens - hundred gevs mini - gamma showers ) is also detectable at a rate discussed below .",
    "as already noted the main shower blazing photons from a cr may be also reborn or overlap with its secondary tens - hundred gevs muons , either decaying in flight as a gamma flashes , or by direct cerenkov muons lights painting arcs or rings while hitting the telescope .",
    "indeed these secondary very penetrating muon bundles may reach hundreds km far distances ( @xmath62 ) away from the shower origin . to be more precise a part of the muon primary energy will dissipate along @xmath32 km air - flight ( nearly a hundred gev energy ) , but a primary @xmath63 gev .",
    "muon will reach a final @xmath64 gev energy , just at minimal magic threshold value .",
    "let us remind the characteristic secondary abundance in a shower : @xmath65 these multiplicity are just at a minimal ( gev ) energies @xcite ; for the harder ( a hundred gev ) muons their number is ( almost inversely proportionally to energy ) reduced : @xmath66 these values must be compared with the larger peak multiplicity ( but much lower energy ) of electro - magnetic shower nature : @xmath67 . as mentioned most of these electromagnetic tail",
    "is lost ( exponentially ) at horizons ( above slant depth of a few hundreds of @xmath68)(out of the case of re - born , upgoing @xmath69 air - showers @xcite,@xcite ) ; therefore gamma - electron pairs are only partially regenerated by the penetrating muon decay in flight , @xmath61 as a parasite electromagnetic showering @xcite . indeed @xmath70 may decay in flight ( let say at @xmath71 gev energy , at @xmath72 level within a @xmath73 km distances ) and they may inject more and more lights , to their primary ( far born ) shower beam .",
    "these tens - hundred gevs horizontal muons and their associated mini - cerenkov @xmath1 showers have two main origin : ( 1 ) either a single muon mostly produced at hundreds km distance by a single ( hundreds gev - tev parental ) c.r .",
    "hadron primary ( a very dominant component ) or ( 2 ) rarer muon , part of a wider and spread horizontal muon bundle of large multiplicity born at tevs - pev or higher energies , as secondary of horizontal shower . between the two cases there is a smooth link .",
    "a whole continuous spectrum of multiplicity begins from an unique muon up to a multi muon shower production .",
    "the dominant noisy `` single '' muons at hundred - gev energies will loose memory of their primary low energy and hidden mini - shower , ( a hundreds gev or tevs hadrons ) ; a single muon will blaze just alone .",
    "the muon `` single '' rings or arcs frequency is larger ( than muon bundles ones ) and it is based on solid observational data ( @xcite ; @xcite , as shown in fig.2 and references on mutron experiment therein ) ; these `` noise '' event number is : @xmath74 the additional gamma mini - showers around the telescope due to a decay ( at a probability @xmath75 ) of those muons in flight , recorded within a larger collecting area @xmath76 is even a more frequent ( by a factor @xmath77 ) noisy signal : @xmath78 these single background gamma - showers must take place nearly once a minute ( in an silent hadronic background ) and they are an useful tool to be used as a prompt meter of the horizontal c.r .",
    "verification .    on the contrary pevs ( or higher energy )",
    "cr shower cerenkov lights maybe observed , more rarely , in coincidence both by their primary and by their later secondary arc and gamma mini - shower .",
    "their @xmath79 gev energetic muons are flying nearly undeflected @xmath80 for a characteristic horizons distances d , partially bent by geo - magnetic @xmath81 gauss fields ; as mentioned , to flight through the whole horizontal air column depth ( @xmath32 km equivalent to @xmath32 water depth ) the muon lose nearly @xmath71 gev ; consequently the origination muon energy should be a little above this threshold to be observed by magic : ( at least @xmath82 gev along most of the flights ) .",
    "the deflection angle is therefore a small one : @xmath83 ) .",
    "magic telescope area ( @xmath84 ) may record at first approximation the following event number of direct muon hitting the telescope , flashing as rings and arcs , each night : @xmath85 to be correlated ( at @xmath86 probability ) with the above results of @xmath87 primary cerenkov flashes at the far distances . as already mentioned before , in addition the same muons are decaying in flight at a minimal probability @xmath88 leading to a mini - gamma - shower event number in a quite wider area ( @xmath89 ) : @xmath90 therefore ,",
    "in conclusion , at @xmath52 zenith angle , there are a flow of primary @xmath91 c.r . whose earliest showers and consequent secondary muon - arcs as well as nearby muon - electron mini - shower take place at comparable ( one every @xmath92 s. ) rate .",
    "these @xmath93 clustered signals offer an unique tool for gauging and calibrating magic ( as well as hess , cangaroo , veritas cerenkov telescope arrays ) for horizontal high energy cosmic ray showers .",
    "some more rare event may contain at once both rings , arcs and tail of gamma shower and cerenkov of far primary shower .",
    "it is possible to estimate also the observable muons - electron - cerenkov photons from up - going albedo muons observed by recent ground experiments @xcite @xcite : their flux is already suppressed at zenith angle @xmath94 by at least two order of magnitude and by four order for up - going zenith angles @xmath95 .",
    "pairs or bundles are nevertheless more rare ( up to @xmath96 @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "they are never associated to up - going shower out of the case of tau air - showers or by nearby glashow @xmath97 and comparable @xmath98 detectable by stereoscopic magic or hess array telescopes , selecting and evaluating their column depth origination , just discussed below .",
    "the appearance of horizontal uhe @xmath99 @xmath100 air - showers ( hortaus or earth - skimming neutrinos ) has been widely studied @xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ; their rise from the earth is source of rare clear signals for neutrino uhe astronomy ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "however also horizontal events by uhe @xmath10 pev , glashow @xmath97 and a possible comparable susy @xmath98",
    "@xcite hitting and showering in air have non negligible event number : @xmath101 assuming the minimal gzk neutrino flux : @xmath102 ev @xmath103 . therefore during a year of night records and such a minimal gzk flux , a crown array of a @xmath104 magic - like telescopes on @xmath105 circle facing the horizons , would discover an event number comparable to a @xmath106 detector , ( nearly a dozen events a year ) . indeed magic facing at the horizons as it is , offer a detection comparable to present amanda @xmath107 effective volume . in conclusion while magic looking up see gamma gev astronomy , magic looking at horizons may well see uhe ( pevs - eevs ) cr , and rarely along the edge , gzk @xmath97 neutrinos , @xmath108 air - showers and , surprisingly even susy @xmath109 lights in the sky ( with showers ) ."
