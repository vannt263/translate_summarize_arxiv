    "galactic archaeology is the detailed study of nearby galaxies that aims to reconstruct their evolutionary histories .",
    "a key , but often elusive , goal is to understand the assembly of an individual galaxy in terms of its initial formation and subsequent mass growth via mergers / accretion of stars and gas .",
    "the formation of massive galaxies ( which are predominately early - type ) is often described in two stages or phases . in the first phase",
    ", it is thought that gas collapses via strong radial inflows , into a turbulent , clumpy rotating disc ( keres et al .",
    "2005 ; dekel et al . 2009 ; ceverino et al . 2010 ; zolotov et al .",
    "the vast bulk of the stars form in - situ within the central galaxy regions . in the second phase ,",
    "mass growth occurs via stars that are formed ex - situ , i.e. within other galaxies that are later accreted / merge onto the host galaxy ( naab et al . 2007 ; oser et al . 2010 , 2012 ; lackner et al . 2012",
    "; dubois et al . 2013 ) . in this picture , accretion may dominate the mass growth at low redshift , with more massive galaxies accreting a larger fraction of their mass ( khochfar et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "recently , naab et al . (",
    "2014 ) presented detailed cosmological zoom simulations with hydrodynamics of 44 massive galaxies formed in two - phases as described above , while also placing them in the context of previous galaxy formation modelling .",
    "in particular , they modelled the shapes and kinematics of their present day simulated galaxies in two dimensions ( 2d ) with a spatial resolution of 0.4 kpc ( about 1/10 of the typical effective radius ) .",
    "this included 2d kinematics of velocity , velocity dispersion ( @xmath1 ) and higher order moments h@xmath2 ( which indicates the skewness of the velocity distribution ) and h@xmath3 ( which indicates the kurtosis , or peakiness , of the velocity distribution ) similar to that provided by today s integral field spectroscopy observations .",
    "different mass assembly histories leave distinct imprints in the 2d kinematic maps and 1d kinematic profiles of the final galaxy . from these imprints",
    "6 distinct evolutionary pathways were identified .",
    "these pathways involved different merger ratio contributions ( minor or major ) , timescales ( early or recent mergers ) and gas contents ( rich or poor ) . although only a small sample , these represent possible pathways for the growth of massive galaxies in a cosmological context .    using the same suite of models as naab et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , wu et al .",
    "( 2014 ) showed that these different assembly pathways were also reflected in the outer kinematic radial profiles of present day simulated galaxies .",
    "the different assembly histories are also naturally associated with different mean fractions of stars formed in - situ and ex - situ ( i.e. accreted ) . in particular , the fraction of stars formed ex - situ is predicted to correlate with galaxy stellar mass and mean stellar age ( naab et al .",
    "2014 ) . using similar initial conditions to the naab et al .",
    "( 2014 ) models , remus et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and hirschmann et al .",
    "( 2015 ) showed that total mass density profiles and stellar metallicity outer gradients respectively , also correlate with the ex - situ fraction . using a semi analytic model approach , khochfar et al .",
    "( 2011 ) focused on the assembly history of centrally fast and slow rotators in a similar cosmology to naab et al .",
    "they concluded that slow rotators accreted over 50 - 90% of their mass in 1 - 2 major mergers and a series of minor mergers .",
    "for fast rotators the accreted fraction is less than 50% and is dominated by minor mergers .",
    "this picture agrees in broad strokes with that of naab et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , although the hydrodynamic simulations suggest that a fraction of slow rotators may have experienced only minor mergers .",
    "moody et al . ( 2014 ) also focused on reproducing fast and slow rotators . in their controlled binary and multiple merger simulations",
    ", they found that binary mergers almost always result in a fast rotator while round , slow rotators as observed in nature require multiple mergers .",
    "the first large 2d kinematic survey of early - type galaxies was the atlas@xmath4 survey ( cappellari et al .",
    "they found a variety of kinematic structures , including the prevalence of embedded kinematic discs .",
    "based on this , they classified 86% of their 260 early - type galaxies to be centrally fast or regular rotators ( i.e. disc - like kinematics with high angular momentum in the inner regions ) and 12% to be slow rotators with low angular momentum . from the sluggs ( sages legacy unifying globulars and galaxies , http://sluggs.swin.edu.au ) survey , arnold et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and foster et al .",
    "( 2015 ) found that centrally slow rotators maintain their slow rotation at larger radii , but centrally fast rotators show significant diversity .",
    "their rotation may plateau , decline or steepen with increasing radius .",
    "similar results were obtained from observations of pne ( coccato et al . 2009 ; cortesi et al . 2013 ) . as well as sluggs , a number of other 2d integral field spectroscopy surveys are underway or near completion e.g. califa , massive , sami , manga ( see brodie et al .",
    "2014 for a summary ) .",
    "each has its own comparative advantages .",
    "a number of previous studies have compared detailed observations with tailored models to infer the past history of individual galaxies .",
    "however , we are aware of only one independent study ( spiniello et al . 2015 ) that has directly compared their own 2d results with the simulations of naab et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and thus assigned an assembly class within the two - phase model of galaxy formation .",
    "the spiniello et al .",
    "( 2015 ) data reached out to 0.7 effective radii ( r@xmath0 ) in ngc 4697 and confirmed the disc - like kinematics found by atlas@xmath4 and the sluggs surveys ( krajnovic et al . 2011 ; arnold et al .",
    "they found its kinematic properties to be most consistent with class a , i.e. having undergone gas - rich minor mergers with gradual dissipation ( however a recent gas - rich major merger may also be a possibility ) . from their stellar population analysis",
    ", they determined that the disk formed some 3 gyr after the bulge .",
    "here we use the high s / n , large radial extent and excellent velocity resolution of the 2d kinematics from the sluggs survey of nearby early - type galaxies ( brodie et al . 2014 ) to compare their stellar properties with those of the simulated galaxies of naab et al .",
    "( 2014 ) . combining with the central ( @xmath51 r@xmath0 ) kinematics from the atlas@xmath4 survey where available ,",
    "we classify our galaxies into one of the six classes of assembly history .",
    "we then compare their v/@xmath1 profiles with average values from the simulated galaxies of wu et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , and the average ex - situ mass fractions of different assembly classes with mean stellar age , mass density profile slope and stellar metallicity gradients .",
    "finally , we discuss the relative frequency of the different assembly classes for the sluggs galaxies and contrast them with model predictions .",
    "based on cosmological zoom simulations of 44 model galaxies , naab et al .",
    "( 2014 ; hereafter n14 ) defined 6 ` assembly classes ' with distinct evolutionary pathways .",
    "the galaxies build up their mass via mergers and accretions , at different times , with variations in gas content .",
    "this gives rise to a range in the relative fraction of ex - situ formed stars to the total stellar mass .",
    "the present day total stellar masses of their galaxies span 2.6 @xmath5 m@xmath6 @xmath5 57 @xmath7 10@xmath8 m@xmath9 , and lie within dark matter halos of mass 2.2 @xmath5 m@xmath6 @xmath5 370 @xmath7 10@xmath10 m@xmath9 .",
    "the different pathways are encoded in the _",
    "present day _ isophotal shapes and 2d kinematics of the galaxies .",
    "we note that the resolution and feedback of the models are limited and refer the reader to n14 for a see a discussion .",
    "below we briefly describe the key properties of each n14 assembly class .",
    "we focus on 2d kinematics since the isophotal shape of galaxies does not provide much leverage between the different classes ( nor do the models cover the full range of observed ellipticities ) .",
    "the 2d kinematic properties are based on the appearance of the 2d velocity and velocity dispersion maps out to 2 r@xmath0 , and the distribution of individual pixel values of the higher order moments h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 versus v/@xmath1 within 1  r@xmath0 .",
