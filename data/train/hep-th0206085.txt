    "the issue of spacetimes generated by point sources in three dimensional ( 3d ) einstein theory has been object of many studies ( for reviews see @xcite-@xcite ) . in 1963",
    ", staruszkiewicz @xcite has begun the analysis of gravity without cosmological constant ( @xmath7 ) in 3d coupled to a static massive point source .",
    "the corresponding space has a conical geometry , i.e. , it is everywhere flat except at the location of the point source .",
    "the space can be obtained from the minkoswki space by suppressing a wedge and identifying its edges .",
    "the wedge has an opening angle which turns to be proportional to the source mass .",
    "gott and alpert @xcite and giddings , abbot and kucha @xcite have studied several features of einstein gravity in 3d , including the non - existence of the newtonian limit and the presence of a conical geometry .",
    "deser , jackiw and t hooft @xcite have generalized the analysis of @xcite in order to find the spacetime solutions generated by an arbitrary number of static massive point sources .",
    "once more the geometry is conical with a wedge angle suppressed at each source proportional to its mass .",
    "they have also constructed the solution corresponding to a massless spinning point source in 3d einstein gravity with @xmath7 .",
    "the extension to include massive spinning sources has been achieved by clment @xcite .",
    "their results indicate that ( besides the conical geometry already present in the spinless case ) the spacetime can be seen as characterized by an helical structure since a complete loop around the source ends with a shift in time proportional to the angular momentum .    in the context of einstein - maxwell theory but still with @xmath7 , deser and mazur @xcite and gott ,",
    "simon and alpert @xcite have found the solutions produced by electric charged point sources .",
    "these spacetimes once more have a conical geometry with an helical structure .",
    "barrow , burd and lancaster @xcite found the horizonless spacetime generated by a magnetic charged point source in a @xmath7 background .",
    "melvin @xcite also describes the exterior solution of electric and magnetic stars in the above theory .",
    "3d static spacetimes generated by open or closed one - dimensional string sources with or without tension ( in a @xmath7 background ) have been constructed by deser and jackiw @xcite .",
    "the extension to the rotating string source has been done by grignani and lee @xcite and by clment @xcite .",
    "other exact solutions in 3d gravity theory produced by extended and stationary sources have been found by menotti and seminara @xcite .",
    "one of the alternative theories to einstein gravity in 3d is the topological massive gravity which includes the chern - simmons term and has been proposed by deser , jackiw and templeton @xcite .",
    "the spacetimes generated by point sources in this theory have been obtained by carlip @xcite and gerbert @xcite .",
    "the spacetimes generated by point sources in 3d einstein gravity with non - vanishing cosmological constant ( @xmath8 ) have been obtained by deser and jackiw @xcite and by brown and henneaux @xcite . in the de sitter case ( @xmath9 )",
    "there is no one - particle solution .",
    "the simplest solution describes a pair of antipodal particles on a sphere with a wedge removed between poles and with points on its great circle boundaries identified . in the anti - de sitter case ( @xmath3 )",
    ", the simplest solution describes a hyperboloid with a wedge removed proportional to the source mass located at the vertex of the wedge . for @xmath9 there are no other interesting solutions with electromagnetic and other fields , as far as we know . on the other hand , for @xmath10",
    "there is a bewildering variety of solutions .",
    "the black hole solution in 3d einstein gravity with @xmath10 has been found by baados , teitelboim and zanelli @xcite .",
    "the extension to include a radial electric field has been done by clment @xcite and martnez , teitelboim and zanelli @xcite and the inclusion of an azimuthal electric field has made by cataldo @xcite .",
    "here , we dedicate a special attention to the solutions of an einstein - maxwell - dilaton action of the brans - dicke type in a @xmath10 background .",
    "the static uncharged solutions of this theory were found and analyzed by s , kleber and lemos @xcite and the angular momentum has been added by s and lemos @xcite .",
    "the uncharged theory is specified by two fields , the graviton @xmath1 , the dilaton @xmath0 , and two parameters , the brans - dicke parameter @xmath4 and the cosmological constant @xmath11 .",
    "the pure electrically charged theory is specified by the extra electromagnetic field @xmath12 and was analysed by dias and lemos in @xcite .",
    "this brans - dicke theory contains seven different cases and each @xmath4 can be viewed as yielding a different dilaton gravity theory .",
    "for instance , for @xmath6 one gets a theory related ( through dimensional reduction ) to 4d general relativity with one killing vector @xcite and for @xmath5 one obtains 3d general relativity analyzed in @xcite . for a review on other 3d theories ,",
    "specially on black hole solutions , see @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in pure magnetic solutions with @xmath3 .",
    "the static magnetic counterpart of the btz solution has been found by clment @xcite , hirschmann and welch @xcite and cataldo and salgado @xcite .",
    "this spacetime generated by a static magnetic point source is horizonless and reduces to the 3d btz black hole solution of baados , teitelboim and zanelli @xcite when the magnetic source vanishes .",
    "the extension to include rotation , definition of conserved quantities , upper bounds for the conserved quantities and an interpretation for the source of magnetic field has been made by dias and lemos @xcite .",

    "many authors have also found self - dual and anti@xmath13self - dual charged solutions of einstein - maxwell @xcite , einstein - maxwell - dilaton and einstein@xmath13maxwell@xmath13chern - simons @xcite theories in 3d ( for a complete review see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to find and study in detail the static and rotating magnetic charged solutions generated by a magnetic point source in the einstein - maxwell - dilaton action of the brans - dicke type mentioned above . in this sense",
    "it is a follow up of our previous paper @xcite on pure electric solutions . here",
    ", we impose that the only non - vanishing component of the vector potential is @xmath14 . for the @xmath5 case",
    ", our solution reduces to the spacetime generated by a magnetic point source in 3d einstein - maxwell theory with @xmath3 , studied in @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 case is equivalent to 4d general relativity with one killing vector analysed by dias and lemos @xcite .",
    "the plan of this article is the following . in section",
    "ii we set up the action and the field equations",
    ". the static general solutions of the field equations are found in section iii and we analyse in detail the general structure of the solutions . the angular momentum is added in section iv and we calculate the mass , angular momentum , and electric charge of the solutions . in section",
    "v we give a physical interpretation for the origin of the magnetic field source .",
    "finally , in section vi we present the concluding remarks .",
    "we are going to work with an action of the brans - dicke@xmath13maxwell type in 3d written in the string frame as @xmath15 } ,                                    \\label{accao}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the determinant of the 3d metric , @xmath17 is the curvature scalar , @xmath18 is the maxwell tensor , with @xmath19 being the vector potential , @xmath0 is a scalar field called dilaton , @xmath4 is the 3d brans - dicke parameter and @xmath11 is the cosmological constant . varying this action with respect to @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath0 one gets the einstein , maxwell and dilaton equations , respectively @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the einstein tensor , @xmath24 represents the covariant derivative and @xmath25 is the maxwell energy - momentum tensor .",
    "we want to consider now a spacetime which is both static and rotationally symmetric , implying the existence of a timelike killing vector @xmath26 and a spacelike killing vector @xmath27 .",
    "we will start working with the following ansatz for the metric @xmath28 where the parameter @xmath29 is , as we shall see , an appropriate constant proportional to the cosmological constant @xmath11 .",
    "it is introduced in order to have metric components with dimensionless units and an asymptotically anti - de sitter spacetime .",
    "the motivation for this choice for the metric gauge [ @xmath30 and @xmath31 instead of the usual `` schwarzschild '' gauge [ @xmath32 and @xmath33 comes from the fact that we are looking for magnetic solutions .",
    "indeed , let us first remember that the schwarzschild gauge is usually an appropriate choice when we are interested on electric solutions .",
    "now , we focus on the well known fact that the electric field is associated with the time component , @xmath34 , of the vector potential while the magnetic field is associated with the angular component @xmath35 . from the above facts , one can expect that a magnetic solution can be written in a metric gauge in which the components @xmath36 and @xmath37 interchange their roles relatively to those present in the `` schwarzschild '' gauge used to describe electric solutions .",
    "this choice will reveal to be a good one to find solutions since the dilaton and graviton will decouple from each other on the fields equations ( [ equacao_met ] ) and ( [ equacao_dil ] ) .",
    "however , as we will see , for some values of the brans - dicke parameter @xmath4 it is not the good coordinate system to interpret the solutions .",
    "we now assume that the only non - vanishing components of the vector potential are @xmath38 and @xmath14 , i.e. , @xmath39 this implies that the non - vanishing components of the anti - symmetric maxwell tensor are @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "use of metric ( [ met_sym ] ) and equation ( [ equacao_met ] ) yields the following set of equations @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath44 .",
    "in addition , replacing the metric ( [ met_sym ] ) into equations ( [ equacao_max ] ) and ( [ equacao_dil ] ) yields @xmath45}=0\\ : ,                                             \\label{max_0 } \\\\ & &   \\omega \\phi_{,rr }        + 2 \\omega \\phi_{,r } \\mu_{,r }        + \\omega \\frac{\\phi_{,r}}{r }        - \\omega ( \\phi_{,r})^2        + \\frac{\\mu_{,r}}{r }        + \\frac{\\mu_{,rr}}{2 }         \\nonumber \\\\    & &   \\hskip 1 cm        + ( \\mu_{,r})^2        -\\frac{1}{4 } \\lambda e^{-2\\mu}=         \\frac{1}{4}e^{-2\\mu}f^{\\gamma \\sigma}f_{\\gamma \\sigma } \\ : .",
    "\\label{eq_dil }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      equations ( [ met_00])-([eq_dil ] ) are valid for a static and rotationally symmetric spacetime .",
    "one sees that equation ( [ met_02 ] ) implies that the electric and magnetic fields can not be simultaneously non - zero , i.e. , there is no static dyonic solution . in this work",
    "we will consider the magnetically charged case alone ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "for purely electrically charged solutions of the theory see @xcite .",
    "so , assuming vanishing electric field , one has from maxwell equation ( [ max_0 ] ) that @xmath47 where @xmath48 is an integration constant which measures the intensity of the magnetic field source .",
    "to proceed we shall first consider the case @xmath49 . adding equations ( [ met_11 ] ) and ( [ met_22 ] ) yields @xmath50 , and so the dilaton field is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a generic constant which will be appropriately defined below in equation ( [ cosmol ] ) .",
    "the 1-form vector potential @xmath53 is then @xmath54 replacing solutions ( [ max_1])-([vec_potent ] ) into equations ( [ met_00])-([eq_dil ] ) allows us to find the @xmath55 function for @xmath56 ; @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively @xmath59 \\ : ,                                           \\label{met-3/2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is a constant of integration related with the mass of the solutions , as will be shown , and @xmath61 . for @xmath62 @xmath52",

    "( [ met_00 ] ) and ( [ met_11 ] ) imply @xmath67 .",
    "now , we consider the case @xmath68 . from equations ( [ met_00])-([eq_dil ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath69 , @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are constants of integration , and that the cosmological constant and magnetic source are both zero , @xmath73 .",
    "so , for @xmath68 the metric gives simply the 3d minkowski spacetime and the dilaton is constant , as occurred in the uncharged case @xcite .",
    "now , we must analyse carefully the radial dependence of the @xmath55 function defined in equations ( [ met_todos])-([met-3/2 ] ) which , recall , is related to the metric components through the relations @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the shape of the @xmath55 function depends on the values of the brans - dicke parameter @xmath4 and on the values of the parameter @xmath60 ( where @xmath60 is related to the mass of the solution as we shall see in section [ sec : mjq ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we can group the values of @xmath4 and @xmath60 into a small number of cases for which the @xmath55 function has the same behavior . the general shape of the @xmath55 function for these cases is drawn in the appendix .",
    "generally , the @xmath55 function can take positive or negative values depending on the value of the coordinate @xmath44 .",
    "however , when @xmath55 is negative , the metric components @xmath74 and @xmath75 become simultaneously negative and this leads to an apparent change of signature from @xmath76 to @xmath77 .",
    "this strongly indicates that we are using an incorrect extension and that we should choose a different continuation to describe the region where the change of signature occurs @xcite .",
    "moreover , analysing the null and timelike geodesic motion we conclude that null and timelike particles can never pass through the zero of @xmath55 , @xmath78 ( say ) , from the region where @xmath79 is positive into the region where @xmath79 is negative .",
    "this suggests that one can introduce a new coordinate system in order to obtain a spacetime which is geodesically complete for the region where both @xmath79 and @xmath37 are positive @xcite .",
    "that is our next step .",
    "then , in section [ sec : geod ] , we will check the completeness of the spacetimes .",

    "the geodesic structure of the rotating spacetime is similar to the static spacetime ( see section [ sec : geod ] ) , although there are now direct ( corotating with @xmath263 ) and retrograde ( counter - rotating with @xmath264 ) orbits .",

    "when we look back to the electric charge given in ( [ carga ] ) , we see that it is zero when @xmath175 , i.e. , when the angular momentum @xmath205 of the spacetime vanishes .",
    "this is expected since in the static solution we have imposed that the electric field is zero ( @xmath265 is the only non - null component of the maxwell tensor ) .    still missing is a physical interpretation for the origin of the magnetic field source .",
    "the magnetic field source is not a nielson - oleson vortex solution since we are working with the maxwell theory and not with an abelian - higgs model .",
    "we might then think that the magnetic field is produced by a dirac point - like monopole .",
    "however , this is not also the case since a dirac monopole with strength @xmath266 appears when one breaks the bianchi identity @xcite , yielding @xmath267 ( where @xmath268 is the dual of the maxwell field strength ) , whereas in this work we have that @xmath269 .",
    "indeed , we are clearly dealing with the maxwell theory which satisfies maxwell equations and the bianchi identity @xmath270 respectively . in ( [ max_j ] )",
    "we have made use of the fact that the general relativistic current density is @xmath271 times the special relativistic current density @xmath272 .",
    "we then propose that the magnetic field source can be interpreted as composed by a system of two symmetric and superposed electric charges ( each with strength @xmath273 ) .",
    "one of the electric charges is at rest with positive charge ( say ) , and the other is spinning with an angular velocity @xmath274 and negative electric charge .",
    "clearly , this system produces no electric field since the total electric charge is zero and the magnetic field is produced by the angular electric current . to confirm our interpretation , we go back to eq .",
    "( [ max_j ] ) . in our solution ,",
    "the only non - vanishing component of the maxwell field is @xmath275 which implies that only @xmath276 is not zero .",
    "according to our interpretation one has @xmath277 , which one inserts in eq .",
    "( [ max_j ] ) . finally , integrating over @xmath82 and @xmath97 we have @xmath278 so , the magnetic source strength , @xmath48 , can be interpreted as an electric charge times its spinning velocity .",
    "looking again to the electric charge given in ( [ carga ] ) , one sees that after applying the rotation boost in the @xmath164-@xmath97 plane to endow the initial static spacetime with angular momentum , there appears a net electric charge .",
    "this result was already expected since now , besides the scalar magnetic field ( @xmath279 ) , there is also an electric field ( @xmath280 ) [ see ( [ a_fim ] ) ] . a physical interpretation for the appearance of the net electric charge is now needed .",
    "to do so , we return to the static spacetime . in this static spacetime",
    "there is a static positive charge and a spinning negative charge of equal strength at the center .",
    "the net charge is then zero .",
    "therefore , an observer at rest ( @xmath281 ) sees a density of positive charges at rest which is equal to the density of negative charges that are spinning .",
    "now , we perform a local rotational boost @xmath282 and @xmath283 to an observer ( @xmath284 ) in the static spacetime , so that @xmath284 is moving relatively to @xmath281 .",
    "this means that @xmath284 sees a different charge density since a density is a charge over an area and this area suffers a lorentz contraction in the direction of the boost .",
    "hence , the two sets of charge distributions that had symmetric charge densities in the frame @xmath281 will not have charge densities with equal magnitude in the frame @xmath284 .",
    "consequently , the charge densities will not cancel each other in the frame @xmath284 and a net electric charge appears .",
    "this was done locally .",
    "when we turn into the global rotational lorentz boost of eqs .",
    "( [ transf_j ] ) this interpretation still holds .",
    "the local analysis above is similar to the one that occurs when one has a copper wire with an electric current and we apply a translation lorentz boost to the wire : first , there is only a magnetic field but , after the lorentz boost , one also has an electric field .",
    "the difference is that in the present situation the lorentz boost is a rotational one and not a translational one .",
    "we have added the maxwell term to the action of a generalized 3d dilaton gravity specified by the brans - dicke parameter @xmath4 introduced in @xcite . for the static spacetime",
    "the electric and magnetic fields can not be simultaneously non - zero , i.e. there is no static dyonic solution .",
    "pure electrically charged solutions of the theory have been studied in detail in @xcite .    in this work",
    "we have found geodesically complete spacetimes generated by static and rotating magnetic point sources .",
    "these spacetimes are horizonless and many of them have a conical singularity at the origin .",
    "these features are common in spacetimes generated by point sources in 3d gravity theories @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the static solution generates a scalar magnetic field while the rotating solution produces , in addition , a radial electric field .",
    "the source for the magnetic field can be interpreted as composed by a system of two symmetric and superposed electric charges .",
    "one of the electric charges is at rest and the other is spinning .",
    "this system produces no electric field since the total electric charge is zero and the scalar magnetic field is produced by the angular electric current . when we apply a rotational lorentz boost to add angular momentum to the spacetime , there appears a net electric charge and a radial electric field .    for @xmath5",
    "our solution reduces to the magnetic counterpart of the btz solution , i.e , to the spacetime generated by a magnetic point source in 3d einstein - maxwell theory with @xmath3 analysed in @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the solutions corresponding to the theories described by a brans - dicke parameter that belongs to the range @xmath80 or @xmath100 have a behavior quite similar to the magnetic counterpart of the btz solution . for this range of the brans - dicke parameter ,",
    "the solutions are asymptotically anti - de sitter .",
    "this allowed us to calculate the mass , angular momentum and charge of the solutions .",
    "the presence of divergences at spatial infinity in the conserved quantities is an usual feature in electric solutions @xcite .",
    "the relation between spacetimes generated by point sources in 3d and cylindrically symmetric 4d solutions has been noticed by many authors ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath6 solution considered in this paper is the 3d counterpart of the 4d longitudinal magnetic string source found in @xcite . indeed ,",
    "the dimensional reduction of 4d general relativity with one killing vector yields the @xmath6 case of brans - dicke theory . further working relating",
    "4d solutions with 3d solutions has been done in @xcite where the two well known families of 4d black holes ( i.e. , the toroidal charged rotating anti - de sitter black holes , and the kerr - newman - anti - de sitter black holes ) are analized and the interpretation of the fields and charges in terms of the three - dimensional point of view is given .",
    "this paper closes our program of studying theories of the brans - dicke type in 3d initiated in @xcite and @xcite and continued in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "in this appendix we study the radial dependence of the @xmath55 function defined in equations ( [ met_todos])-([met-3/2 ] ) .",
    "the qualitative shape of the @xmath55 function varies with the brans - dicke parameter @xmath4 and with the mass parameter @xmath60 .",
    "however , we can form a small number of seven cases for which the @xmath55 function and the spacetime structure has the same behavior .",
    "these seven cases are analysed in the text and the corresponding figures describing the respective shape of the @xmath55 function are as follows , @xmath80 @xmath285 fig .",
