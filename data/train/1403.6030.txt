    "note also that both transition temperatures decrease linearly with the application of external field ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "these linear dependencies , which hold in quite a broad range of temperatures , are hallmarks of the diamagnetic breaking of cooper pairs , cf . the results of the ginzburg - landau theory or the werthamer - helfand - hohenberg solution of the gorkov equations .",

    "fig : fig4 ] . for even stronger fields",
    ", the dominant phase completely masks the other phase .",
    "it is quite clear that both phases have similar superconducting properties , i.e. , comparable transition temperatures and upper critical fields .",
    "one may speculate that these phases differ by the presence / magnitude of the distortion reported previously in refs .  [ ] .",
    "the distortion lowers the density of states at the fermi level which decreases the transition temperature .",
    "however , such a distortion simultaneously affects the landau orbits , which effectively increases the upper critical field.@xcite while a microscopic theory is missing , one may carry out phenomenological modeling of @xmath5 as discussed below .",
    "the lack of a specific heat jump at @xmath30 suggests that the high - temperature phase is spatially inhomogeneous .",
    "a similar temperature dependence of the specific heat has been observed in pros@xmath1sb@xmath84 , where a double superconducting phase transition has been identified at temperatures @xmath85 1.85 k and @xmath86 1.70 k;@xcite in a few cases , a single sharp transition at @xmath87 has been reported,@xcite in a study in which ru was partially substituted for os , the transition at @xmath88 was stabilized,@xcite and in other experiments only a broad peak in @xmath5 was observed.@xcite the values of the lower and higher transition temperatures and the magnitudes of the corresponding specific heat jumps are sample dependent , suggesting sample inhomogeneity may be the origin of the double superconducting phase transition in pros@xmath1sb@xmath84 .",
    "another system where two superconducting phase transitions were found is cept@xmath0si .",
    "it is argued that the second transition results from a second phase with a slightly different chemical composition.@xcite it was reported that bulk superconductivity in a high - quality single crystal has a critical temperature significantly lower than for a polycrystal,@xcite which may suggest that the high - temperature superconductivity is related to disorder .",
    "moreover , the presence of inhomogeneities of superconducting characteristics has been reported even in a single crystal.@xcite this may explain the fact that in high - quality single crystals , the electrical resistivity drops to zero at a temperature similar to the critical temperature of polycrystals.@xcite this situation resembles what we observe in la@xmath23rh@xmath24sn@xmath2 , where the electrical resistivity drop is observed at a higher temperature than the temperature of the sharp jump in the sp ecific heat , indicating the onset of a bulk , homogeneous superconducting phase .",
    "anomalies similar to those observed in la@xmath23rh@xmath24sn@xmath2 are present also in the specific heat of ceirin@xmath89 .",
    "one of them , corresponding to the onset of bulk superconductivity , is a sharp jump in @xmath5 , whereas the other at higher temperature , is much less pronounced and corresponds to the drop of the electrical resistivity to zero.@xcite in this case , the discrepancy between @xmath3s determined from different measurements was also explained by the presence of an inhomogeneous superconducting phase .",
    "assuming that the scenario of inhomogeneous superconductivity in la@xmath23rh@xmath24sn@xmath2 is plausible , we can explain the presence of the two anomalies in the specific heat at @xmath3 and @xmath30 .",
    "namely , we believe that the anomaly at @xmath30 marks the onset of an inhomogeneous superconducting phase with spacial distribution of the magnitude of the superconducting energy gap @xmath90 . following ref .  , we assume a simple gaussian gap distribution , @xmath91,\\ ] ] where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are treated as fitting parameters .",
    "the electronic contribution to the specific heat within the bcs theory can be given by the dashed line ( 5 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7](a ) .",
    "the fitting parameters were determined in such a way that this electronic contribution , when added to the linear @xmath5 observed above @xmath30 [ dashed line ( 4 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7](a ) ] , describes the specific heat for temperatures between @xmath3 and @xmath30 [ line ( 3 ) ] .",
    "of course , the inhomogeneous phase contributes also to the specific heat below @xmath3 .",
    "this means that the experimental data for the specific heat below @xmath3 , fitted by the dashed line ( 1 ) , includes both the contributions from the homogeneous and inhomogeneous phases . subtracting the inhomogeneous contribution",
    ", we obtain the dash - dotted line ( 2 ) , which represents only the homogeneous phase with a spatially uniform energy gap .",
    "the absence of a significant anomaly in the specific heat at @xmath30 suggests that only a small part of the sample becomes superconducting at the higher critical temperature .",
    "this volume fraction , however , has to be large enough to produce a complete drop of the electrical resistivity to zero .",
    "the assumption of the existence of homogeneous and inhomogeneous regions with different critical temperatures seems to explain both the double superconducting phase transition and the shape of the specific heat .",
    "the question however remains , what induces the inhomogeneity of the superconducting order parameter ?",
    "one of the possible explanations is the presence of a small number of impurities .",
    "this scenario is supported by the fact that the critical temperature in the inhomogeneous phase is _ higher _ than in the homogeneous one .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "that in strongly correlated systems the magnitude of the superconducting order parameter can be _ increased _ in a vicinity of an impurity .",
    "this mechanism has been used to explain the observed enhancement of superconductivity close to off ",
    "plane oxygen dopants in the high@xmath3 superconductors@xcite and may lead to a specific heat similar to that observed in la@xmath0rh@xmath1sn@xmath2 between @xmath3 and @xmath94.@xcite    in the above we assumed a scenario based on a presence of regions with inhomogeneous superconducting order parameter .",
    "one can also imagine other explanations , e.g. , based on an assumption of a presence of completely different phase .",
    "however , since the resistivity sharply drops to zero in the high  critical  temperature phase the volume occupied by this phase would have to be large enough to be beyond the percolation threshold .",
    "but such a large volume of a different phase would be clearly visible in ..... , what is not the case .",
    "therefore , we exclude such a possibility .",
    "intermetallic superconductors often exhibit structural instabilities.@xcite the application of external pressure to these superconducting materials can drive the compounds towards ( or away ) from lattice instabilities by varying the dominant parameters determining the superconducting properties ; e.g. , electronic density of states at the fermi level .",
