    "@xcite .",
    "standard practice when inverting @xmath2 with the code imago is to compare results with different choices of ib , srp and other parameters in order to establish the uniqueness of the potential . in some cases , as discussed below , it becomes difficult to identify a unique potential ..",
    "the 115.9 mev case is very interesting for several reasons , just one of them being the remarkable meteorological connections  @xcite .",
    "the coupling to states of both projectile and target nucleus specified in ref .",
    "@xcite greatly modifies the elastic scattering angular distribution , ad , see fig .",
    "the coupling leads to @xmath2 for the elastic scattering channel that , when inverted , yield strongly undulatory ( ` wavy ' or ` oscillatory ' ) potentials .",
    "the first result , potential ` cc2potx ' , shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] corresponding to a low value of s - matrix distance @xmath10 . for such low values of @xmath5 ,",
    "the ad calculated with the inverted potential would be indistinguishable from the coupled channel , cc , ad in a figure such as fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , for all angles .",
    "we note that for the srp , @xmath11 so that the inversion process has reduced @xmath5 by more than three orders of magnitude . the srp in this and most cases is the ` bare ' elastic channel potential , and its @xmath2 corresponds to the channel coupling being switched off . therefore , the difference between the solid and dashed lines is a representation of the dynamic polarization potential , dpp , that is due to the coupling .",
    "[ tbh ]    there are three obvious questions : 1 .",
    "what do these very strong undulatory features mean ?",
    "2 . are they realistically a possible property of a nucleus - nucleus single channel interaction potential ?",
    "3 . is the potential cc2potx a unique solutions to the inversion problem ?",
    "[ tbh ]    [ tbh ]    [ tbh ]    the answer to the third question is ` no ' , it is not a unique solutions to the inversion problem as we shall see from the existence of alternative solutions in figures  [ fig3 ] ,  [ fig4 ] and  [ fig5 ] . in cases where the s - matrix corresponds to a reasonably smooth potential , ip inversion yields a practically unique solution .",
    "this can be established by comparing solutions with different srps , different ibs ( ibs using different dimensionalities and sets of basis functions ) and other parameters .",
    "this is usually straightforward , and spurious oscillations can be eliminated .",
    "however spurious oscillations are possible because of the existence of ` transparent potentials ' .",
    "a transparent potential is an oscillatory potential that , when added to an existing potential , leads to very small ( effectively zero ) changes in the s - matrix and hence the observables .",
    "these can be eliminated from ip inversion , except when the true potential that is sought is also highly oscillatory , in which case there is no natural ` smoothest ' potential .",
    "that seems to be the case here .",
    "the problem is considerably less severe for on at higher energies , as in the 330 mev case  @xcite where there is a larger number of partial waves to determine the potential .",
    "moreover , coupling effects tend to become somewhat weaker at higher energies .",
    "the answer to the second question is that strong undulations are indeed a property of a nucleus - nucleus interaction that includes the effect of strong inelastic couplings as in the present case .    concerning the four solutions presented here : the imaginary part of cc2potx ( fig .  [ fig2 ] )",
    "has extreme undulations which extend to a radius far beyond 10 fm .",
    "potential cc3pot7 ( fig",
    ".  [ fig3 ] ) has much less extreme undulations in the imaginary part , but they also extend unrealistically far out .",
    "it was found that solutions which do not extend to unrealistically large radii can be found as in cc4pot7 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the dotted line ) , but apparently at the cost of large excursions in the imaginary part and a higher value of @xmath12 , about @xmath13 higher than for cc3pot7 . in general , following any sequence of iterations , the undulations increase as @xmath5 falls , and this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] where the dashed line represents the potential for an earlier iteration , with @xmath14 .",
    "the tendency for the undularity to increase as @xmath5 falls is evident .",
    "an independent inversion ( involving an alternative initial inversion basis ) led to the potential ccxpot12 , shown as the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , which has the same overall shape as potential in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and comparable inversion @xmath5 .",
    "the ad corresponding to the ccxpot12 is graphically indistinguishable from the ad for the cc calculation .",
    "for ccxpot12 , the inversion @xmath15 .",
    "the undulations of the potential in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , while having the same general shape as those in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , are of much smaller amplitude , noting the different scale for the imaginary term .",
    "the real components of the potentials in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and fig .  [ fig5 ]",
    "have almost the same volume integral in spite of the different amplitude of the undulations , and both have a similar increase in rms radius compared to the bare potential .",
    "in fact , all of the potentials of figures  [ fig2 ]   [ fig5 ] exhibit the same uniform repulsive effect for a radius of less than about 3 of 4 fm . for the imaginary components , the volume integrals and rms radii of the potentials in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] are quite similar , and in both cases the volume integrals are greater and the rms radii are less than those of the bare potential .",
    "we consider ccxpot12 in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] to provide the provisional best potential representation of the elastic scattering s - matrix from the cc calculations  @xcite .",
    "all the potentials presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] through fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] yield ads that are graphically indistinguishable out to @xmath16 from the cc ads on the scale of the figures .",
    "[ tbh ]    less undulatory potentials inevitably have higher inversion @xmath5 and fit a limited angular range .",
    "for example , a potential on the iterative path to ccxpot12 with @xmath5 a factor of 10 times larger had similar general features : the imaginary term had a dip at 4 fm and a peak at 6 fm although somewhat less pronounced .",
    "the angular distribution for this potential had clear differences from that for the cc calculation beyond @xmath17 .",
    "these differences were typically a factor of 3 for many angles and a factor of 6 at @xmath16 .",
    "it is now clear that we have not provided a unique answer to the following basic question : what @xmath0-independent potential corresponds to the s - matrix generated by the relevant channel coupling ?",
    "however , it is quite certain that no non - undulatory , @xmath0 independent potential could ever give anything approaching a good fit to the angular distribution that is calculated from the s - matrix generated by the coupled channel model of ref .",
    "it is very reasonable to assume that the same would apply to the experimental data that the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite approximately fit .",
    "we therefore give a tentative answer to question 1 above .",
    "the strong undulations present an alternative : either the potential for the case in question is indeed highly undulatory , or it is @xmath0-dependent ( it might be both ) .",
    "the question of how generic this alternative is must be the subject of further work ; the question of why smooth and @xmath0-independent potentials are so often considered acceptable will be commented upon in section  [ disco ] .    in the course of determining",
    "potentials that reproduce the cc s - matrix , fits of a precision are required ( and achieved ) that are not approached in conventional phenomenology .",
    "however , there is a possible relevance to conventional phenomenology : the ambiguities , corresponding to transparent potentials , that have been found for 115.9 mev scattering on , are likely to be present in model - independent fits ( spline , sum of gaussian etc ) to precision experimental ad data of wide angular range .",
    "in ref .  @xcite some examples",
    "were given , for light ion cases , of the relationship between @xmath0-dependent potentials and the corresponding @xmath0-independent potentials with the same @xmath2 or , in the case of nucleons the same @xmath9 .",
    "we now present a preliminary exploration of the relationship between @xmath0-dependence and the corresponding undulatory nature of @xmath0-independent s - matrix - equivalent potentials .",
    "the examples all relate to the scattering of from at a laboratory energy of 115.9 mev so as to maximize the relevance to the situation in section  [ thepot ] .",
    "the idea is to take @xmath0-independent potentials , impose @xmath0 dependence upon them and invert the resulting @xmath18 matrix in order to study undulations that might arise in those @xmath0-independent potentials that are equivalent , in terms of @xmath2 , to the @xmath0-dependent potentials .",
    "the @xmath0-independent potentials that we start with have simple woods - saxon forms .",
    "the real part is chosen to be roughly like the bare folded potential of ref .",
    "@xcite and the imaginary part is exactly the imaginary woods - saxon ( ws ) term given in that reference .",
    "the ws parameters for the real part are @xmath19 mev , @xmath20 fm and @xmath21 fm and for the imaginary part @xmath22 mev , @xmath23 fm and @xmath24 fm .",
    "the imposed @xmath0-dependence is simple and takes the form of added terms @xmath25 or @xmath26 where the @xmath27 factor multiplying a real ( @xmath28 ) or imaginary ( @xmath29 ) terms is given by : @xmath30 in the present calculations , @xmath28 and @xmath29 each have a woods - saxon form with the same radius and diffusivity parameters as the corresponding real and imaginary @xmath0-independent terms . as a result , the @xmath0-dependent potentials essentially have a renormalized real or imaginary component for @xmath0 less than @xmath31 , with a fairly sharp transition since @xmath32 is quite small .",
    "the potential is unmodified for values of @xmath0 substantially greater than @xmath31 .",
    "this pattern is motivated by the tendency for undulatory potentials to arise particularly when there is a substantial change for partial waves having @xmath0-values around the point where @xmath33 .",
    "we adopt an @xmath0-dependent factor @xmath27 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 and @xmath29 with a depth of 0.7 mev .",
    "the effect is to increase the depth of the imaginary part from 14 mev to 14.7 mev , a 5 % increase , for values of @xmath0 less than 20 , with a fairly sharp transition to zero change for higher @xmath0 . for @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "the inversion results of are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] where the srp for the inversion is given by the solid line and this is the @xmath0-independent potential . in this figure",
    "the dotted line corresponds to inversion @xmath38 and the dashed line for an earlier iteration corresponds to inversion @xmath39 .",
    "it will be seen that the potential has a characteristic oscillatory feature in the surface which has an amplitude much greater than the potential there .",
    "this is quite similar to the surface feature in the imaginary potential in fig .",
    "the volume integral of the imaginary term is , in each case , greater than that of the @xmath0-independent potential , by 8.56 % for the dashed case and 8.24 % for the better fitting dotted case .",
    "this is nearly twice the increase imposed on the potential for values of @xmath0 less than 20 .",
    "the change in the volume integral of the real part is 100 times smaller , amounting to a @xmath40% change . in this sense the @xmath0 dependence in the imaginary component has induced a relatively small change in the real component .",
    "however , although the imposed undulations are small on the scale of the figure , the magnitude is comparable to that of the undulations in the imaginary component , but they have a nearly zero volume integral .",
    "[ tbh ]    the two potentials shown follow the general tendency for the undulations to become enhanced in amplitude as @xmath5 becomes smaller as the iterations progress , i.e.  as @xmath2 for the @xmath0-independent potential determined by inversion more closely approaches @xmath2 for the @xmath0-dependent potential .",
    "local regions of emissivity in the surface undulations , do not lead to a breaking of the unitarity limit since the well - fitted @xmath2 are calculated to have @xmath41 .",
    "we conclude that such excursions into local emissivity are not an argument against the potentials that we showed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] which exhibit similar undulations in the surface .",
    "we remark that local regions of emissivity are a very common feature of dpps representing coupling effects in a wide range of nuclear scattering cases .",
    "they also occur in some model independent fits to elastic scattering  @xcite .",
    "naturally , there is no reason to expect that the model @xmath0-dependence we have applied is a realistic representation of the effects of strong channel coupling .",
    "however , it does show that @xmath0-dependence appears to be necessary to reproduce the effects of strong coupling with a smooth potential .",
    "probably quite a small degree of @xmath0-dependence is enough .",
    "similar calculations were performed including an @xmath0-dependent real part for the same scattering case and with the same @xmath0-independent term .",
    "again , the parameter @xmath42 was 20 .",
    "[ tbh ]    the real potential was first increased from 250 mev to 251 mev for @xmath0 less than 20 , with the same fairly sharp transition .",
    "this represents a small percentage change in the potential for low @xmath0 , although in absolute magnitude it was comparable to the change in the imaginary part , ( note however that the radial extent of the real potential is rather less than that of the imaginary term . )",
    "the inverted potential had no strong surface undulations , unlike the case with the imaginary @xmath0-dependence .",
    "the real potential had two regions where the potential is increased in depth : near the origin and near the surface .",
    "the real volume integral is increased by 0.59 % , which is not unreasonable in view of the fact that the potential was increased by 0.4 % for the lowest 20 partial waves , which are those with substantial penetration .",
    "the volume integral of the imaginary potential fell by just 0.19 % , the positive and negative excursions roughly cancelling .    to obtain a more visual result ,",
    "@xmath28 was increased by a factor of 10 so that the real potential was 260 mev deep for @xmath0 less than @xmath43 with the same fairly sharp transition .",
    "we therefore expect roughly @xmath44 the effect .",
    "the @xmath0-independent potential shown as a dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , does indeed depart from the solid line following the same pattern enhanced in magnitude by that factor .",
    "the increase in depth of the real potential in the lowest radial range and also around @xmath45 fm is clear .",
    "the change in the volume integral is a 5.61 % increase .",
    "the change in the imaginary part is qualitatively like that for the 1 mev case , but much larger point - by - point .",
    "however the change in volume integral is very small indicating that the positive and negative changes cancel in the integration for @xmath46 .",
    "it appears to be a general rule that while a real @xmath0-dependent term leads to a perturbed real @xmath0-independent term having a substantial change in volume integral , the change in the imaginary term has a small volume integral although not small point by point .",
    "the converse is also true respecting an imaginary @xmath0-dependent term .",
    "because the unmodified real potential had a much smaller radial extent than the imaginary potential , that difference applied also to the added @xmath0-dependent term ; this might relate to the absence of surface undulations in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .",
    "there are too many possible forms of @xmath0 dependence for an exhaustive study here , but we have shown that @xmath2 from the cc calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite implies @xmath0 dependence in both the real and imaginary potentials generated by the coupling .",
    "other forms of @xmath0-dependency have been applied to heavy ion interactions , and those forms that do not involve a distinct change change between high and low partial wave , as in eq .",
    "[ lfac ] when @xmath47 with @xmath48 , may not lead to strong undulations .",
    "an example of @xmath0-dependence in the real part is provided by the rgm calculations of wada and horiuchi  @xcite for + elastic scattering .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence arises from exchange terms beyond the 1-particle knock - on exchange that is normally included implicitly in folding models .",
    "horiuchi  @xcite reviews such calculations in the context of a more general discussion of microscopic nucleus - nucleus potentials .",
    "the set of @xmath2 values corresponding to the @xmath0-dependent real potentials of wada and horiuchi have been inverted  @xcite to yield an @xmath0-independent potential which is significantly different at lower energies from that derived  @xcite using wkb methods .",
    "the difference between the equivalent complete @xmath0-independent potential from the @xmath0-independent ( non - exchange ) part of the ref .",
    "@xcite potential is most marked in the nuclear interior .",
    "this work clearly established that exchange processes lead to an @xmath0-dependence of nucleus - nucleus interactions ( in addition to any parity - dependence . )",
    "the @xmath0 dependence of wada and horiuchi apples to partial waves that would , in a more realistic calculation , be strongly absorbed .",
    "this makes their @xmath0 dependence difficult to establish or disprove experimentally .",
    "the model for + scattering of kondo _ et al _",
    "@xcite , included a phenomenological @xmath0-dependent real term inspired by the model of wada and horiuchi , together with an @xmath0-dependent imaginary term .",
    "the @xmath2 for the potential with both terms @xmath0-dependent was readily inverted  @xcite and the resulting real potential had a very similar shape and energy dependence to that found  @xcite for the wada - horiuchi potential .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence of the real part of the kondo _",
    "@xcite potential was of the an overall factor @xmath49 , i.e. a gradual @xmath0 dependence unlike that in eq .",
    "this , by design , leads to a very similar energy dependence for the @xmath0-independent potential found by inverting the wada and horiuchi  @xcite s - matrix .",
    "it seems that there is a systematic qualitative difference between the equivalent @xmath0-independent potentials found for these ` gradual ' @xmath0-dependencies and the sharper fermi - form @xmath0-dependencies which tend to generate much more undulatory equivalent potentials .",
    "we remark that a consistent calculation involving both the full antisymmetrization and full channel coupling would be very difficult .",
    "however , it does seem that the effects of antisymmetrization affect the potential at a small radius and might therefore be less relevant when the strong absorption of realistic calculations makes effects near the nuclear centre less significant .",
    "the coupled channel calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite have three important characteristics : ( i ) they were based on an established cluster model for the interacting nuclei , ( ii ) they explained an otherwise unexplained large angle feature of elastic scattering , and ( iii ) an @xmath0-independent potential that reproduces their angular distribution in a single channel calculation has strongly undulatory features .",
    "these features include emissive regions , particularly in the nuclear surface .",
    "such effects are likely to elude approximate fits to experimental ad data that is of limited angular range .",
    "the calculations presented here lead to the following conclusion that applies at least to the scattering case of our example : in order to generate , _ using a potential without undulations _ , the s - matrix @xmath2 that reproduces the effect of channel coupling , the potential must be @xmath0-dependent . in other words , in some cases at least , the representation through a potential model of the effects of strong channel coupling presents a choice between a potential that is undulatory and one that is @xmath0-dependent .",
    "the same alternative has previously been firmly established for nucleons scattering from and and other cases  @xcite . for cases such as that considered here",
    ", the range of possible @xmath0 dependencies makes it difficult to pin down the specific form of the @xmath0 dependence of the potential .    in the case of nucleon scattering",
    ", it has been shown that coupling to collective states of the target nucleus generates a dpp having substantial undulations  @xcite .",
    "formal theory shows  @xcite that the dpp is both @xmath0-dependent and non - local in a complicated way that is unlike exchange non - locality .",
    "however there are separate lines of evidence for both @xmath0-dependence and the appearance in empirical potentials of departures from the smooth forms of customary parameterized or folding model potentials  @xcite . for an example of an empirical deuteron potential showing wavy features ,",
    "see ref .",
    "there is a need for more such model independent good fits to elastic scattering data that are both precise and of wide angular range .",
    "the concept of a ` good fit ' is highly context dependent , but in the present context , ` good fit ' means @xmath50    the question arises : why has @xmath0-dependence not been widely accepted ? for the case of proton scattering , it is only when precise fits to wide angular range data are demanded that the need for either waviness or @xmath0-dependence becomes evident .",
    "it is also the case that for nucleon elastic scattering from target nuclei away from closed shells , angular distributions tend to be smoother and , as a result , have less power to discriminate between potentials . for the case of heavier ions",
    ", it becomes difficult to measure angular distributions over a wide angular range .",
    "the angular distribution fitted in ref .",
    "@xcite for on at a laboratory energy of 115.9 mev extended out to about 140@xmath51 .",
    "this angular range would obviously be impossible for identical bosons .",
    "for the case of on at 350 mev , experimental uncertainties appear to become large at around 55@xmath51 .",
    "it has to be conceded that potentials with no hint of undulations can fit this angular distribution with an imaginary term that is very close to that which corresponds to the static model glauber potential  @xcite ; it would be very interesting to know what would be found if more precise data of greater angular range were fitted .",
    "indeed , it would seem _ a priori _ that the contribution found in on scattering at 115.9 mev  @xcite due to the excitation of states of would also contribute to on scattering at a similar energy .",
    "the present calculation raises , but throws little light on , an important general question : how does the supposed @xmath0-dependence depend upon energy ?",
    "there certainly were undulatory features in the dpps that were found at 330 mev  @xcite , but less severe , and the dpps were more uniquely determined .",
    "for proton scattering , the @xmath0 dependence appears to fall with increasing energy  @xcite and this may well be a general property .",
    "the @xmath0-independent potentials that yield the same @xmath2 as the strong channel coupling in the case of 115.9 mev on elastic scattering , ref .",
    "@xcite , exhibit strong undulations .",
    "this is firmly established although the exact nature of these undulations is hard to pin down definitively .",
    "an oscillatory potential in the surface region appears to be required and local excursions into emissivity do not necessarily lead to the breaking of the unitarity limit .. simple model @xmath0-dependent potentials lead to elastic scattering s - matrices @xmath2 that , when inverted , yield undulatory @xmath0-independent potentials . the undulations exhibit some of the same features that are characteristic of the potentials generated by collective coupling , including the oscillations in the surface .",
    "there is therefore a non - exclusive alternative : the potential is undulatory or it is @xmath0 dependent .",
    "we conjecture that this would be found to apply generally if serious model - independent fitting of suitable elastic scattering data were carried out systematically .",
    "there are very many ways in which @xmath0-dependence could be introduced into a phenomenological potential , and in section  [ model ] we have restricted the choice to a single form each for the real and imaginary terms separately .",
    "it was found that an @xmath0-dependent real part generated some moderate waviness in both real and imaginary terms of the corresponding @xmath0-independent potential , but the volume integral of the imaginary part was almost unchanged .",
    "conversely , an @xmath0-dependent imaginary term left the volume integral of the real part almost unchanged , although that was perturbed point by point .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence in the imaginary part generated very wide amplitude undulations in the corresponding @xmath0-independent term .",
    "the underlying @xmath0-independent potential , upon which the @xmath0-dependency was based , had an imaginary term that extended much further in radius , and it might be that this had an influence of the lesser tendency for @xmath0-dependence in the real part to generate large amplitude undulations .",
    "this is just one of the many things that could be explored in a similar way .",
