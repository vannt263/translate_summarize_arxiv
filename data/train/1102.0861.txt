    "tidal interactions are important in determining the fate of short - period extrasolar planets and the spins of their host stars .",
    "the extent of the spin - orbit evolution that results from tides depends on the dissipative properties of the body .",
    "these are usually parametrized by a dimensionless quality factor @xmath0 , which is an inverse measure of the dissipation , and which in principle depends on tidal frequency , the internal structure of the body , and the amplitude of the tidal forcing .",
    "the mechanisms of tidal dissipation that contribute to @xmath0 in fluid bodies are not well understood .",
    "we can generally decompose the response to tidal forcing into an equilibrium tide , which is a quasi - hydrostatic bulge , and a dynamical tide , which is a residual wave - like response .",
    "dynamical tides in radiation zones of solar - type stars take the form of internal ( inertia- ) gravity waves ( igws ) , which have frequencies below the buoyancy frequency @xmath1 .",
    "these have previously been proposed to contribute to @xmath0 for early - type stars ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zahn , 1975 ) ) .",
    "we consider a nonlinear mechanism of tidal dissipation in solar - type stars , extending an idea by @xcite .",
    "a short - period planet excites igws at the base of the convection zone , where @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is its orbital period .",
    "these waves propagate downwards into the radiation zone , until they reach the centre of the star , where they are geometrically focused and can become nonlinear .",
    "if their amplitudes are sufficient , convective overturning occurs , and the wave breaks .",
    "this has consequences for the tidal torque , and the stellar @xmath0 .",
    "we study this mechanism , primarily using numerical simulations .",
    "we solve the boussinesq - type system of equations derived in @xcite , which are valid in the central few per cent of the radius of a solar - type star , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 measures the strength of the stable stratification at the centre , and takes a value @xmath7 , for the current sun .",
    "a cartesian spectral code is used to solve these equations , with our model being an initially non - rotating , 2d cylindrically symmetric star .",
    "we artificially excite @xmath8 waves in the outer parts of the computational domain , which are the dominant response for a planet on a circular , equatorial orbit .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the azimuthal velocity , normalised to the farfield radial phase speed of gravity waves in the simulation for a calculation with small - amplitude ( left ) and large - amplitude ( right ) forcing .",
    "if waves are excited with small - amplitude forcing , such that they do not overturn the entropy stratification near the centre , then the waves reflect perfectly from the centre of the star , and global modes can form in the radiation zone . in this case",
    "efficient tidal dissipation only occurs at discrete resonances ( * ? ? ?",

    "is satisfied , where @xmath10 are the stellar and planetary masses , waves are excited with large enough amplitudes so that isentropes are overturned by fluid motions in the wave , within the innermost wavelength .",
    "this leads to wave breaking and the deposition of angular momentum , which spins up the mean flow to the orbital angular velocity .",
    "this results in the formation of a critical layer , at which ingoing wave angular momentum is efficiently absorbed , and the star is spun up from the inside out .",
    "this results in efficient dissipation , leading to ( for waves launched where @xmath11 increases linearly from the interface ) , @xmath12      this is a potentially important nonlinear mechanism of tidal dissipation , which only operates in ( solar - type ) g or k stars , with radiative cores .",
    "this process requires massive planets or older / more centrally condensed stars .",
    "it is not in conflict with current observations of extrasolar planets , and may explain the absence of massive close - in planets around g - stars .",
    "this would not operate in f - type stars , with convective cores , and so its absence may partly explain the survival of massive close - in planets around f - stars , e.g. wasp-18 ."
