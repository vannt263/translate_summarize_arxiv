    "the cosmological velocity field is induced by the gravitational affect of the inhomogeneities in the matter distribution in the universe .",
    "therefore the recessional velocities of galaxies experience deviations from pure hubble flow , the result of the expansion of space , due to the distribution of matter both luminous and dark .",
    "the amplitude and distribution of these deviations or _ peculiar velocities _ allows measurement of the power spectrum of the fluctuations in the matter distribution .",
    "this is an important quantity to constrain because it tells us how structure has grown on different scales in the universe , and this in turn depends on the amount of and nature of the components in the universe , i.e. the baryonic matter , dark matter , dark energy .",
    "the distribution of galaxies in the universe is not likely to be the same as the distribution of matter , since most of the mass is in the form of indirectly detectable dark matter .",
    "it is known that galaxies of different types cluster differently @xcite , so they are clearly not completely unbiased tracers of the underlying mass , and this issue is referred to generically as galaxy biasing .",
    "comparatively therefore , the distribution of galaxy peculiar velocities has an advantage over the distribution of galaxies in probing the matter distribution because they are likely to be unbiased traces of the matter velocity field .",
    "this is then simply related to the density field in linear theory .",
    "since peculiar velocities are a non - local function of the dark matter distribution then analysing the peculiar velocity field provides information on scales larger than the sampled region @xcite as the velocity at a point is determined by the integral over the matter distribution in a large volume .",
    "peculiar velocities are interesting for another reason as they provide the only way to measure clustering of objects at practically redshift zero , noting that the clustering measured by the density field is complicated by redshift space distortions and galaxy bias .",
    "weak lensing , lyman-@xmath6 forest ( ly-@xmath6 ) and cluster count measurements are obtained only at higher redshifts , often where dark energy was just starting to dominate .",
    "understanding the strength and amount of clustering in the local universe could help discriminate between different models that affect the growth of large scale structure such as dark energy models and modified gravity .    in practice",
    "peculiar velocities are complicated by several factors .",
    "the major one is that on small scales the density field is highly nonlinear ; these effects leak into the velocity field and can not be described analytically .",
    "results from previous surveys which apply likelihood analysis ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for mark iii , enear and sfi respectively ) seemed to overestimate the combination @xmath7 significantly compared to other probes at the time and to the current concordance cosmology .",
    "studies by @xcite and @xcite show that this over - estimation may be due to inaccurate modelling of the nonlinear part of the power spectrum , the small scales .",
    "the method employed in this paper overcomes this issue by smoothing the small - scale velocity field by averaging together peculiar velocity measurements regularly in a small volume of space , see section [ section : grid ] for details .",
    "another disadvantage of peculiar velocity analysis is the accuracy of the peculiar velocity measurements . because a redshift - independent estimate of the distance to the galaxy is required , and these estimates are usually extremely noisy .",
    "most previous peculiar velocity surveys have used distance indicators such as the fundamental plane / dn-@xmath8 @xcite and the tully - fisher relation @xcite .",
    "these are galaxy scaling relations and it is because of their large scatter that the distance estimates are so noisy .",
    "the calculated distance is a relative distance measure which is strongly subject to a number of biases and also has very large uncertainties of around 20 percent , all of which translates to the peculiar velocity .",
    "although type 1a supernovae ( sn1a ) are more accurate as distance indicators ( they have smaller distance errors , 5% to 10% ) the current samples are very small ( around 150 ) , whereas galaxy peculiar velocity samples are always in excess of 1000 objects .",
    "the sfi++ @xcite is the largest galaxy sample to date so provides an excellent opportunity to improve the statistics of peculiar velocity surveys .",
    "there has recently been a resurgence of interest in peculiar velocity analysis , after it fell out of favour in the late 1990s due to the apparent overestimation of @xmath7 described above .",
    "the renewed interest can be roughly catagorised into the following areas : bulk flow measurements ; as a  useful \" systematic to sn1a luminosity distance measurements ; the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich ( ksz ) effect .",
    "bulk flow measurements have been recently made by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "measurements of the large scale velocity field , or bulk flow , has a number of interesting applications .",
    "if a difference exists between measurements of our dipole motion made using local peculiar velocities , and the dipole motion inferred from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) then this may be an indication of a departure from the standard wmap5 cosmological model ( as published in * ? ? ?",
    "otherwise , because the bulk flow is a sensitive probe of the matter density fluctuations on very large scales , it can probe the amplitude and shape of the matter power spectrum .",
    "two recent studies of peculiar velocity surveys indicated a large bulk flow .",
    "@xcite found a strong bulk flow on scales out to 300 @xmath9 using the ksz .",
    "@xcite reported a large - scale bulk flow beyond 50 @xmath9 from a comprehensive compilation of peculiar velocity data .",
    "both these papers claimed that the bulk flow at these depths , determined by their studies , were difficult to explain within the framework of standard @xmath2cdm model of cosmology .",
    "it has been recently found that the peculiar velocity field does in fact affect measurements of the expansion of the universe from sn1a .",
    "low redshift ( 0.02@xmath100.1 ) sn1a are required both as a well - observed calibrating sample and as a lever arm for the sn1a hubble diagram ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "although we are more interested in the expansion history of the universe at redshifts @xmath11 , these low redshift  calibrating \" sn1a have sufficiently low redshifts that the local velocity field systematically correlates their luminosity distance measurements .",

    "the paper is organised as follows , in section [ section : data ] we describe the sfi++ data set , and in section [ section : meth ] we describe our method of analysing this data .",
    "our results are presented in section [ section : res ] and discussion and conclusions of these results are in sections [ section : disc ] and [ section : conc ] .",
    "the sfi++ sample @xcite consists of around 5000 spiral galaxies that have measurements which are suitable for the application of the i - band tully - fisher ( tf ) relation .",
    "this sample builds on the older sci and sfi samples , but includes significant amounts of new data , as well as improved methods for parameter determination .",
    "the rotation widths for the sfi++ sample come from the 21-cm line global profile widths ( hi , about 60% ) and optical rotation curves ( h@xmath6 , about 40% ) .",
    "the catalogue presented in @xcite represents a homogeneously derived set of distances and peculiar velocities that are corrected for both the homogeneous and inhomogeneous malmquist biases using the 2mass redshift survey @xcite for the line - of - sight density field .",
    "the data set we use comes from @xcite after some corrections were made to the original tables published in @xcite .",
    "the morphological - type correction for the peculiar velocity calculation was not properly applied in the original tables and this problem has now been rectified . the data set contains 4053 galaxies which have a median redshift of 0.019 .",

    "the analysis described in this section follows @xcite , for full details please refer to that paper .",
    "we use linear theory to predict the velocity correlation function and use a multivariate gaussian to calculate the likelihood .",
    "section [ section : grid ] describes how we overcome two potential problems : biases from nonlinear growth of structure and the large number of velocities in the survey .",
    "see also the work by @xcite , who perform a similar cosmological likelihood analysis using a friends - of - friends technique .      to estimate cosmological parameters we compute the radial peculiar velocity correlation function ( hereafter vcf ) from linear theory for each set of parameters .",
    "we define the peculiar velocity with observational error as @xmath14 , therefore the observed vcf is defined by @xmath15where the average is over realisations of the universe . in practice",
    "we average over a large enough volume of space to assume ergodicity .",
    "the first term is the signal vcf and the second term is the contribution from the errors in the velocity measurements . because the errors are assumed to be uncorrelated so they only affect the diagonal terms in @xmath16 . in linear theory , the signal part @xmath17 can be split up into perpendicular and parallel components @xcite , which are scalar functions of r=@xmath18 @xmath19 where the angles are defined by @xmath20 and the diagonal elements @xmath21 are given by eq .",
    "[ eq : diag ] below .",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent the velocity correlations along the line - of - sight and perpendicular to the line - of - sight respectively .",
    "they are calculated from the matter power spectrum and assuming all galaxies are approximately at redshift zero @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the first and second derivative of the zeroth order spherical bessel functions respectively , @xmath28 is the hubble constant and @xmath5 is the density of matter in the universe normalised by the critical density , @xmath29 is the derivative of the growth function .",
    "the auto correlation is given by @xmath30 the dependence on the cosmological parameters of interest enters the above equations in the following ways : @xmath0 through the normalisation of the power spectrum @xmath31 ; @xmath5 through f@xmath32 ( where @xmath33 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and through its effect on the shape of the matter power spectrum ; @xmath1 through @xmath29 as stated above . to compute eq .  [ eq : psi ] and eq .  [ eq : diag ] the power spectrum @xmath31 is generated using camb @xcite .",
    "the above equation for @xmath34 assumes that the galaxies are at low redshift , therefore equations [ eq : psi ] and [ eq : diag ] are only valid for low redshifts .",
    "the full equation contains the growth rate at the redshift of each galaxy but because of the redshift range of sfi++ it is unnecessary to do the full computation here .",
    "peculiar velocity surveys using distance indicator relations ( as sfi++ does ) are unlikely to have a significant amount of data beyond a redshift of 0.05 .",
    "the growth rate increases by less than 1 per cent between redshift zero and redshift 0.05 for a flat @xmath2cdm model with @xmath35 , so this is a good approximation for this paper .",
    "we also use the approximation that the hubble expansion is constant , described simply by a constant expansion rate for all galaxies in the survey .    to calculate the covariance matrix @xmath36 ( eq .  [ eq : rij ] in matrix notation )",
    "it is necessary to calculate the equations [ eq : rij ] to [ eq : diag ] for a given set of cosmological parameters @xmath37 . assuming that the peculiar velocities and the observational errors are gaussian random fields the likelihood function for the parameter set @xmath37 can be written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the observed radial velocities .",
    "the likelihood analysis outlined above uses the individual galaxy peculiar velocities , @xmath40 , as the data .",
    "however determining cosmological parameters in this way does not take account of the nonlinear part of the peculiar velocity signal because , as stated above , we make our prediction for the vcf based only on linear theory .",
    "the density field becomes nonlinear only on small scales , above a wave number ( @xmath41 ) of about 0.2@xmath42 mpc@xmath43 .",
    "the next section describes how we alter the above analysis to take account of this nonlinear signal .",
    "this method is a way of averaging together the peculiar velocities of spatially close galaxies by laying a grid across the survey .",
    "averaging over a number of galaxies allows the linear signal to dominate .",
    "this averaging however will necessarily smooth the velocity field which is equivalent to damping the small scale contributions .",
    "this reduces the observed correlations because we average away some of the signal .",
    "if the data is averaged on a grid and inserted directly into the equations in section  [ subsection : vcf ] without accounting for the averaging in the correlation function then the cosmological parameters will be biased .",
    "therefore we present below how to implement this type of binning on the velocity field , and detail a practical approach to take account of the binning accurately in the vcf .",
    "we do not follow the approach seen in previous work which includes an effective noise term due to any remaining non - linear signal ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found including such a noise term has only marginal effects on the results , and we have shown in @xcite that the grid averaging and the window function given by eq .",
    "[ eq : window ] removed any nonlinear bias on @xmath0 to well within the statistical precision .",
    "the technique we implement here is designed to be simple and fast . for a more complete description of this method , including its performance after rigorous testing with simulations , see @xcite .",
    "the method is implemented as follows .",
    "we lay down a grid across the survey and average together all the peculiar velocities within each grid cell so that @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the radial peculiar velocity of the cell and @xmath46 is the error on the velocity of the cell ; the angle brackets denote an average over all galaxies @xmath47 within the cell @xmath48 .",
    "note that @xmath49 is the contribution to the correlation function from the random velocity errors of each galaxy and therefore the remaining contribution @xmath50 to the binned correlation function is reduced by the square root of the number of galaxies .",
    "this type of binning is then taken account of by multiplying the power spectrum in eq .",
    "[ eq : psi ] and  [ eq : diag ] with a window function corresponding to the size and shape of the grid cell , which has the following form in fourier space @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the length of a side of a cell in the grid , and the angle brackets denote an average over fourier space directions .",
    "this means equations that eq .",
    "[ eq : psi ] and  [ eq : diag ] become @xmath53 where we use the position of the cell centre to calculate all the required distances .",
    "the corresponding vcf and likelihood are then formed using the smoothed quantities .",
    "the method for accounting for the velocities described above assumes the data inside each grid cell is a continuous field , whereas it is in fact discrete values at the locations of the galaxies ; we shall refer to this as the _ sampling effect_. galaxies trace discrete points of the peculiar velocity field , but if enough discrete points are averaged over then they will closely approximate averaging over a continuous distribution",
    ". however , some grid cells will not contain enough galaxies to provide a reasonable measure of the average of the velocity field within that cell , perhaps due to masked out areas in the survey or poor sampling in some areas .",
    "for example there is a deficiency of galaxies in the declination range of @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "the sampling effect is not simply shot noise .",
    "the under - sampling of the velocity of a cell by a finite number of galaxies causes a spurious boost in the variance and if this effect is unaccounted for it could bias the cosmological parameters , e.g. the effect on @xmath0 would be to bias it to too high a value .",
    "we found in @xcite if we reduce the size of the modification to the diagonal elements of the vcf , @xmath21 , according to the number of galaxies in each cell we could remove any bias caused by the sampling effect .",
    "the following relation for this reduction was used : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the corrected value used to calculate the diagonal elements of the vcf ; @xmath56 is calculated from eq .",
    "[ eqn : sidiagsmooth ] ; @xmath57 is calculated from eq .  [",
    "eq : diag ] .",
    "this correction uses the correct value for the diagonal elements of the correlation function in the limit that there is just one galaxy in the cell and also in the limit that there are infinite galaxies in the cell , i.e. a continuous field ; for intermediate numbers of galaxies the value of diagonal elements of the vcf should be an improvement on using @xmath58 .",
    "we assume the following cosmological parameters throughout : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "first we need to determine the optimum smoothing length @xmath52 so as not to introduce bias in the cosmological parameters from nonlinear signal or from the smoothing technique itself .",
    "to do this we find the best - fit @xmath0 for various smoothing length @xmath52 for both the sfi++ data , and also a linear simulation of around 1500 galaxies .",
    "for this we have additionally fixed @xmath35 .",
    "the results of this are shown in figure [ varygrid ] .",
    "the bold ( blue ) points are the results from the sfi++ data , the faint ( green ) points are the results from the linear simulation .",
    "we simulate galaxy velocities for the linear simulation with the correlation function @xmath63 in eq .",
    "the number of galaxies in sfi++ is large enough that computation of the covariance matrix and eigenvalues was prohibitively slow so we simulate just 1500 galaxies .",
    "we use real positions of galaxies in sfi++ data set but simulate 50 realisations of peculiar velocities , and the resulting constraint on @xmath0 is the average over these 50 realisations . the fiducial @xmath0 for the linear simulation was @xmath64 and is shown on figure [ varygrid ] by the horizontal dashed line .",
    "the large bias at @xmath65mpc/@xmath42 is mainly an artifact of the gridding method , and not due in any major way to nonlinear bias or other systematic .",
    "this is confirmed because the linear simulation results follow closely the results of the sfi++ data , and recover the fiducial @xmath0 after @xmath66mpc/@xmath42 .",
    "therefore we find that @xmath67mpc/@xmath42 is the best choice of smoothing length : large enough to avoid any bias but small enough so as not to redundantly increase the statistical error on the cosmological parameters .",
    "this value is close to the value of the optimum smoothing length found in @xcite of @xmath66mpc/@xmath42 . to check",
    "we are not affected by velocity bias , we repeated the linear simulation , with the same number of objects but with uniform distribution instead of a distribution which matched sfi++ .",
    "we did not find any significant difference in the results . with the optimum grid cell size of @xmath67mpc/@xmath42",
    "we constrain @xmath5 and @xmath0 simultaneously .",

    "@xcite on the other hand constrain the growth function @xmath34 indirectly , mainly through observations of @xmath96 inferred from ly-@xmath6 , and they find @xmath97 .    as the amount of data available for this type of analysis increases",
    "it will be interesting to see if the growth index reveals any possible departures from the @xmath2cdm / dark energy predicted value of @xmath33 .",
    "we presented cosmological parameter constraints using the sfi++ galaxy peculiar velocity data .",
    "we performed the analysis by using the gridding method developed in @xcite .",
    "the gridding method is an efficient way to analyse the data given the large number of velocities in the survey , and without gaining biases on the cosmological parameters from the nonlinear growth of structure . by comparing with a linear simulation we found the optimum scale on which to average the peculiar velocity data was @xmath67mpc/@xmath42 , and this scale is consistent with the optimum scale found in @xcite .    to summarise the main points :    * galaxy and sn1a peculiar velocities provide the only way to truly measure clustering at redshift zero .",
    "they can provide a low redshift anchor for measuring the evolution of the growth of structure .",
    "* peculiar velocities are sensitive to the derivative of the growth function , and can provide competitive constraints on parameters such as @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    ". therefore they are a useful tool for discriminating between @xmath2cdm and modified gravity models .",
    "* our constraints from sfi++ peculiar velocities are consistent with many other constraints found in the literature and with @xmath2cdm .",
    "however the constraints come from a mixed range of scales and necessarily will be dominated by the smaller scales which have the least uncertainties . any departure from @xmath2cdm on larger scales ( @xmath98mpc )",
    "will not be well tested by this data set .",
    "* the different degeneracy direction of constraints in the @xmath0-@xmath5 plane compared to e.g. weak lensing will also be useful in breaking degeneracies , see also @xcite . * because peculiar velocities will be subject to different systematic effects to other probes such as cluster - counts , weak lensing or redshift distortions , they are an important complementary probe of cosmology .    in the near future much more peculiar velocity data will become available , boosting even more the importance of this kind of analysis .",
    "the new technique of measuring galaxy cluster peculiar velocities using the ksz could soon be achieved in large samples by sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) surveys such as the atacama cosmology telescope ( act , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the south pole telescope ( spt , * ? ? ?",
    "the ksz is the temperature shift of cmb photons caused by a moving galaxy cluster .",
    "it is proportional to the line - of - sight momentum of the cluster gas , so therefore the radial peculiar velocity of the cluster can be inferred .",
    "the huge advantage of this method over using galaxies or sn1a is that the ksz measurement is redshift independent .",
    "this means we can probe the velocity field out to much larger redshifts , and with a greater accuracy than with galaxy peculiar velocity surveys , see @xcite for forecasts on the possible constraint on @xmath12 . although measurement of the ksz signal is still a difficult challenge observationally @xcite .    on a shorter timescale ,",
    "an upcoming release of the six degree field galaxy survey will contain around 10 000 galaxy peculiar velocities , an order of magnitude larger than most peculiar velocity surveys to date .",
    "furthermore there are ever growing sn1a samples ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and current and upcoming surveys such as skymapper @xcite and gaia @xcite should push the sample size of sn1a well into the thousands .",
    "we thank sarah bridle , hume feldman , andrew jaffe , ofer lahav , karen masters and christopher springob for their many helpful comments and discussion ."
