    "the standard model ( sm ) has been tested by the experiments at lep , slc and tevatron with a high accuracy .",
    "in particular , the yield of lepton pairs produced mainly via drell - yan processes , i.e. quark - antiquark annihilation by exchange of photons or @xmath1 bosons , is predicted by the sm with a per mille precision .",
    "so far , the experimental data have shown no significant deviation from the sm predictions for the drell - yan continuum up to tev - energy - scale .",
    "the high - order calculations of lepton pair production cross section in the mass region of @xmath2 @xmath3 are indeed in good agreement with d0 and cdf data @xcite .    at present , however , there are many theoretical attempts to extend the bounds of the sm in order to incorporate the unification of strong and electroweak interactions , the mass hierarchy and cp - violation problems , the arbitrariness of flavor mixing and the number of generations , etc .",
    "supersymmetry is the most popular theoretical extension to the sm .",
    "however , as an alternative , also extended gauge models , based on symmetry groups wider than in the sm , have been considered .",
    "this way leads to the various left - right symmetric models , extended gauge theories including grand unification theories , and models of composite gauge bosons @xcite . in all these cases , new vector bosons , neutral @xmath0 and charged @xmath4 ,",
    "would appear at a mass scale of the order of one @xmath3 what can be observed at lhc .",
    "one of the most attractive and exciting , although the most complicated , goal of modern theoretical physics is to provide a `` unified '' description of all forces known in nature and give an adequate explanation of the creation and the evolution of the universe .",
    "the quite new paradigm of the gravity at tev energies , as given in the large or infinite extra dimension ( led ) and brane world scenarios , which propose a solution of gauge hierarchy problem , have recently discussed @xcite .",
    "one of the possible led scenarios is the randall - sundrum ( rs ) approach @xcite based on the warp phenomenology of the @xmath5 nonfactorizable geometry with the curvature @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath7 @xmath9 @xmath10 and the metric    @xmath11 here , @xmath12 , is the compactification radius of the extra dimension , @xmath13 is the standard four - dimensional minkowski metric , @xmath14 are ordinary four - dimension coordinates and @xmath15 is the extra dimension coordinate .",
    "the distinctive feature of the rs phenomenology with two branes ( one with positive tension @xmath16 at @xmath17 and the other with negative tension @xmath18 at distance @xmath12 ) , so - called rs1 model @xcite , is the infinite tower of kaluza - klien graviton modes appearing at the scale @xmath19 .",
    "it has a zero mode , @xmath20 , describing the usual four - dimensional gravity and massive modes with the mass splitting between them of order @xmath21 .",
    "the exponential factor @xmath22 removes the hierarchy between the plank and electroweak scales if @xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "the first kaluza - klein graviton mode ( called the rs1 graviton below ) , as well as @xmath0 , is strongly coupled to ordinary particles .    in both the conceptions above , the width of the predicted resonances is not fixed , it can vary widely depending on the model parameters .",
    "it implies that these states can appear as individual resonances or can affect the high-@xmath25 lepton pairs continuum leading to an excess of drell - yan production .",
    "thus , the distinctive experimental signature for these processes is a pair of well - isolated high-@xmath25 leptons with opposite charges coming from the same vertex .",
    "these measurements can be performed at the both lhc experiments , atlas and cms , which is expected to be able to trigger and identify hard muons with a transverse momentum up to several tev .",
    "the ability of the lhc experiments to detect virtual rs1 graviton in the muon mode was investigated as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the analysis of the lhc discovery limit of @xmath0 and both virtual and real rs1 gravitons in assumption of the cms acceptance are presented .",
    "the signal simulation is done for the parton subprocess @xmath26 in the qcd leading order without high order corrections . to generate the @xmath0 boson and its decay to a muon pair as well as",
    "the relevant background events , the pythia 6.217 @xcite package with the cteq5l parton distribution function was used .",
    "there are many possible non standard model scenarios which predict the existence of heavy neutral @xmath0 and/or charged @xmath27 gauge bosons ( reviews in @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath0 models which were used for this analysis are the following :    1 .   the left - right model ( lr ) @xcite based on the electroweak gauge group symmetry @xmath28 ( here , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the baryon and lepton numbers ) with default pythia couplings which are the same for both left- and right - handed type of fermions and",
    "are set to the same values as in the sm , @xmath31 = @xmath32 = 0.64 .",
    "the number of extra fermion generations is equal to three . 2 .",
    "@xmath33- , @xmath34- , and @xmath35-models which naturally arise as a result of the sequential breaking of @xmath36 or @xmath37 group symmetry for grand unified theories ( gut ) @xcite : @xmath38 . the linear combination of the hypercharges of the two groups @xmath39 gives the charge of the lightest @xmath0 at the symmetry - breaking energies @xmath40 .",
    "the numerical values of the couplings for these models are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite 3 .",
    "also used for monte carlo studies is the `` sequential '' standard model ( ssm ) @xcite in which the heavy bosons ( @xmath0 and @xmath27 ) are assumed to couple only to one fermion type ( left ) with the same parameters ( couplings and the total width ) as for ordinary @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the standard model .",
    "the non - reducible background considered is the drell - yan processes @xmath43 which gives nearly 95 % of the the standard model muon continuum .",
    "the contribution from the other reaction ( vector boson pair production ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) , and @xmath47 production ) is very small and is neglected in this study . in the sm",
    "the expected number of di - muon events is not very large and the @xmath0 resonance peak exceeds the background by about a factor ten ( fig .  [ fig : crs_z ] , left plot ) .",
    "event samples for seven mass values were generated with the above - mentioned model parameters . to take into account the detector response the parametrization of the muon momentum ( @xmath48 ) resolution , @xmath49 @xcite , was used .",

    "the efficiency of di - muon pair selection , @xmath55 , is also taken into account .    to estimate the @xmath0 discovery limit",
    "the expected significance of the signal , s/@xmath58 , was computed , where @xmath59 is the number of signal events passed through all kinematics cuts and @xmath29 is the number of background events . in order to insure the statistical significance of the signal for low background the minimal number of signal events , @xmath60 ,",
    "equal to ten has been required , i.e. @xmath60 = @xmath61 .",
    "the discovery limits for a five @xmath16 signal are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : eff_z ] ( right plot ) for various integrated luminosity : 10 @xmath62 , 100 @xmath62 , 1000 @xmath62 ( three bottom - up curves ) .",
    "as shown in this picture , the @xmath0 boson can be detected up to masses given in table [ tab : z_limit ] .",
    "the detection of the @xmath0 peak and the very precise measurement of its mass and width do not allow the theoretical model describing the @xmath0 to be identified . to test the helicity structure of the boson and",
    "discriminate between the @xmath0 models , the leptonic forward - backward asymmetry can be used ( see , for an example , @xcite ) .",
    "the asymmetry is defined as the ratio @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath29 are the number of the events in the forward and backward direction , respectively .",
    "forward ( backward ) is defined as the hemisphere with @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , where @xmath67 is the angle between the outgoing negative lepton and the quark @xmath68 in the @xmath69 rest frame .",
    "such definition assumes that the original quark direction is known , but this is not the case for the @xmath70-experiment . in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , it was shown that it is possible to approximate the quark direction with the boost direction of the di - muon system with respect to the beam axis .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the standard model background for this channel is the same as for the @xmath0 case .",
    "the simulation of the detector response for the graviton decay into muon pair is similar to the @xmath0 case ( sect .",
    "2.2 ) . to estimate the discovery limit for the rs1 graviton the same procedure as for the @xmath0 case was applied .",
    "the cross section of @xmath71 production and the corresponding cross section limits to observe a five @xmath16 signal , for various integrated luminosity , are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : rs1_sign ] .",
    "as shown in the figure , the lhc can test the rs1 scenario in the whole range of the model parameter ( @xmath72 = 0.01 ) up to a mass of 2.0 @xmath3 even with a low luminosity of 10 @xmath62 . in the more favourable case with @xmath72 = 0.1 the accessible mass region",
    "is extended up to 3.7 @xmath3 . with 100 @xmath62 the reach increases to 2.6 @xmath3 for @xmath72 = 0.01 and 4.8 @xmath3 for @xmath72 = 0.01 .",
    "the results of the combined analysis in the rs1 scenario @xcite show that the value of the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath72 and the corresponding value of the graviton mass are strongly restricted due to the experimental tevatron data and theoretical constraints to assure the model hierarchy ( @xmath73 10 tev ) .",
    "the limitations lead , in particular , to the conclusion that the constant @xmath72 can not be less than 0.027 , for the graviton mass of one @xmath3 , and less than 0.1 , for the mass of 3.7 @xmath3 .",
    "the direct comparison of these results with the data of the fig .",
    "[ fig : rs1_sign ] shows that the whole space of the rs1-model parameters is accessible at luminosity of 100 @xmath62 , and the rs1 graviton can be discovered with the five @xmath16 significance .",
    "these conclusions , however , are not definitive , since the initial theoretical constraints are very arbitrary .    under the assumption that the new resonance state is observed at lhc , the nature of this object should be understood ( in principle , it can come from the extended gauge sector as well as from any version of extra dimensions ) .",
    "the major difference between the @xmath0 and the rs1 graviton should appear in the @xmath74 distribution ( where @xmath75 is the polar angle of the muons in the center - of - mass system of the di - muon pair ) which is strongly spin dependent .",
    "certainly , these distributions will be distorted by acceptance cuts , especially in the region of large angles , and the expected theoretical predictions will differ from experimental ones .",
    "nevertheless fig .",
    "[ fig : angle ] shows a distinct difference between the spin-1 ( @xmath0 ) and the spin-2 ( rs1 graviton ) curves obtained for muons after all cuts . to ease the comparison ,",
    "these plots were obtained for resonance states with mass of 1.5 @xmath3 , and normalized to 6000 events that correspond to an approximate integrated luminosity of 10 @xmath62 for graviton production with @xmath72 = 0.1 and 100 @xmath62 for @xmath0 boson .",
    "this work presents the discovery potential of @xmath0 gauge bosons as well as rs1 gravitons in the muon channel at the lhc experiments .",
    "the estimated discovery limit for @xmath0 is about 3.5 @xmath76 4.0 @xmath3 , depending on the couplings , for 100 @xmath62 integrated luminosity . at the same luminosity ,",
    "zero kk - modes of the rs1 graviton state can be observed up to 2.6 @xmath3 and 4.8 @xmath3 for @xmath72 = 0.01 and 0.1 , respectively .",
    "the angular distribution of the muons in the final state can be used to distinguish the spin-1 and the spin-2 hypotheses , at least in the mass region up to 1.5 @xmath3 .",
    "the different @xmath0 models can be distinguished ( up to mass of two @xmath3 ) because of the different the leptonic forward - backward asymmetry .",
    "further detailed studies are required on the theoretical side in order to identify other possible physics observables .",
