    "jump diffusion models have gained considerable attention in the last two decades , especially in finance and economics , where they are used to model asset prices as a function of time .",
    "an advantage of these models , over the classical black ",
    "scholes models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , based solely on a continuous brownian motion , is their ability to accommodate the rapid  seemingly discontinuous  changes in asset prices often seen in applications .",
    "in fact , several authors have concluded that neither a purely - continuous nor purely - jump model is sufficient for real applications ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . more specifically ,",
    "by comparing the observed behavior of at - the - money and out - of - the - money call option prices near expiration with their analogous theoretical behavior , @xcite and @xcite argued that both continuous and jump components are necessary to explain the implied volatility behavior of s&p500 index options . in this paper",
    "we consider a continuous - time process @xmath0)$ ] over a fixed and finite time horizon @xmath1 $ ] that can be decomposed as @xmath2,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is a continuous diffusion  with @xmath4 the drift coefficient , @xmath5 the volatility coefficient , and @xmath6)$ ] a standard brownian motion  and",
    "@xmath7)$ ] is a pure jump process with finite activity and independent of @xmath8 .",
    "we emphasize here that we only assume that , with probability  1 , the jump process @xmath9 has a finite number of jumps in @xmath1 $ ] and that each jump is finite .",
    "for example , the results herein cover the case where @xmath9 is a compound poisson process .",
    "the quantity of interest here is the volatility coefficient @xmath5 , a fundamentally important measure of uncertainty or risk @xcite ) .",
    "our goal is to construct a bayesian posterior distribution or , more generally , a data - dependent measure , @xmath10 on @xmath11 that can be used to provide valid uncertainty quantification about the volatility coefficient .",
    "if the entire process @xmath12 were observable , then we could immediately identify the jumps and , by subtraction , this could be converted to a standard problem .",
    "however , here , as is typically the case in practice , the process @xmath12 is not fully observable ; in particular , we can only observe @xmath12 at @xmath13 fixed times @xmath14 .",
    "this is the context considered in , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a consequence of observing the process only at discrete times is that the continuous and jump parts can not be separated , so we are forced to deal with the jump part of the process .",
    "bayesian uncertainty quantification is achieved by modeling all unknowns and using bayes s theorem to get a posterior distribution for inference on @xmath5 .",
    "unfortunately , the need to model the jump portion of the process causes a number of difficulties : in particular , for sufficiently flexible models for @xmath9 , the likelihood function is analytically intractable ; specifying priors and computing the posterior for the distribution of @xmath9 , perhaps using abc methods ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , may be non - trivial and expensive ; and a misspecified model for @xmath9 can bias the posterior inference on @xmath5 . since the distribution of @xmath9 in is a nuisance parameter , it is desirable to have an alternative `` bayesian - like '' approach that gives a posterior distribution for the volatility while , at the same time , avoids those shortcomings of a proper bayesian approach .",
    "this is our goal here .    towards this",
    ", we consider a purposely misspecified model that completely ignores the jumps , basically treating the observations as if they arise from a simple diffusion model .",
    "this misspecified model is highly regular and easy to compute , so if this is not heavily influenced by misspecification , then perhaps it would suffice for valid uncertainty quantification on the volatility coefficient @xmath5 .",
    "a special case of our theorem  [ thm : bvm ] below says that the corresponding pseudo - bayesian posterior is asymptotically normal but the misspecification has some undesirable effects , namely , the center is off - target and the spread is too large . to correct for the effects of misspecification",
    ", we consider two adjustments : a suitable scaling of the log - likelihood to correct the spread and a location shift .",
    "both of these adjustments rely on us having a suitable estimator of the quadratic variation of the jump process @xmath9 .",
    "we then show , in theorem  [ thm : fixed ] , that the corresponding modified pseudo - bayesian posterior is asymptotically normal , centered around a consistent estimator of the true volatility , with variance equal to the cramr ",
    "rao lower bound for optimal / ideal case when there are no jumps , i.e. , the model is not misspecified .",
    "the particular modification is easy to implement and we present some simulation results to illustrate the validity of the corresponding pseudo - bayesian posterior credible intervals in finite samples .",
    "assume that we observe the continuous - time process @xmath15 at @xmath13 distinct time points @xmath16 , i.e. , our observations are @xmath17 ; for notational convenience later on , set @xmath18 and @xmath19 . for notational simplicity , we will assume that the time points are equally spaced , so that each time difference @xmath20 equals @xmath21 ; the case of non - equally spaced sampling can be handled similarly . to avoid dealing directly with the jump component of the model",
    ", we consider a purposely misspecified model that ignores both the drift and the jump part , i.e. , it assumes that the differences @xmath22 , @xmath23 , are iid @xmath24 for some @xmath25 .",
    "this misspecified model is easy to work with and has no nuisance parameters so , if it  or a simple modification thereof  also provides valid inference on the volatility , then it ought to be useful .",
    "the likelihood function for this misspecified model , up to proportionality constants , is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the maximum likelihood estimator .",
    "just like in the familiar bayes approach , we introduce a prior distribution @xmath28 for @xmath5 , with density function @xmath29 . here",
    "we consider a generalization of the bayesian setup by define the pseudo - posterior distribution as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a suitable ( possibly stochastic ) sequence to be specified .",
    "the distribution @xmath10 in is sometimes referred to as a `` gibbs posterior '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath31 is a `` temperature '' parameter ; the case @xmath32 corresponds to the usual bayes posterior .",
    "unlike in the well - specified bayesian setting , where posterior consistency is typical , our model being misspecified means that we can not expect @xmath10 to converge to a point mass at the true volatility coefficient .",
    "therefore , some correction will be needed to point the pseudo - posterior towards the true volatility coefficient , but first we need to understand how @xmath10 in behaves without any intervention on our part .",
    "a fundamental result in bayesian asymptotics is the bernstein ",
    "von mises theorem , which states that , under certain regularity conditions , a suitably centered and scaled version of the posterior will resemble a normal distribution , in the sense that the total variation distance between that normalized posterior and the normal distribution converges to zero in probability .",
    "this classical version is typically used in the case of a well - specified model , but recently there has been work on a version of the bernstein ",
    "von mises theorem for misspecified models .",
    "in particular , @xcite , in their theorem  2.1 , give a bernstein ",
    "von mises theorem when the model is misspecified .",
    "our result that follows is based on their approach .    before stating the result",
    ", we need to introduce some notation .",
    "let @xmath33 denote the distribution of the differences @xmath34 , with @xmath35 , under the jump diffusion model , and @xmath36 the corresponding conditional distribution , given the jump part @xmath9 of the process . also , let @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote the true drift and volatility coefficients , and define the expectation , conditional expectation , variance , and conditional variance as @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "we consider a `` high - frequency '' scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so @xmath13 is large and it is safe to assume that , with probability  1 , the time windows @xmath43 contain at most one jump .",
    "therefore , for almost all @xmath9 , under @xmath36 , we have that @xmath34 are independent , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 for a given @xmath9 , let @xmath46 denote the quadratic variation of the jump process @xmath9 , and let @xmath47 denote the set of indices @xmath48 such that the window @xmath43 contains a jump , i.e. , @xmath49 if and only if @xmath50 .",
    "we assume that the process has finite jump activity , so @xmath51 with @xmath33-probability  1 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath31 is a stochastic sequence and that there exists @xmath52 , possibly depending on @xmath9 , such that @xmath53 in @xmath36-probability for the given @xmath9 . finally , the point around which the pseudo - posterior will concentrate is @xmath54 note that both @xmath55 and @xmath52 are constants with respect to the conditional distribution @xmath36 .",
    "[ thm : bvm ] consider the pseudo - bayesian posterior @xmath10 in based on a prior @xmath28 and the misspecified model with likelihood in . if the prior density @xmath29 is continuous and positive in a neighborhood of @xmath55 , then , for @xmath33-almost all @xmath9 , the posterior @xmath10 is asymptotically normal in the sense that @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the total variation distance .",
    "the above conclusion also holds unconditionally , i.e. , the above convergence is also in @xmath33-probability .",
    "see the appendix .",
    "the theorem asserts that , for the `` high - frequency '' setting where @xmath13 is large , if the data - generating process has finite jump activity , then the pseudo - posterior will resemble a normal distribution centered around @xmath58 .",
    "since @xmath58 converges to @xmath55 ( see the proof of the theorem ) , it follows that the posterior will resemble a normal distribution centered at @xmath55 .",
    "this is different from the usual bernstein ",
    "von mises theorems found in the bayesian literature in that the point around which the posterior concentrates depends on both parameters and a hidden portion of the data , namely , @xmath59 .",
    "there are two seemingly undesirable consequences of misspecification .",
    "the first , as alluded to above , is that @xmath10 is biased in the sense that the point around which @xmath10 concentrates is @xmath55 instead of the true volatility coefficient @xmath38 .",
    "the second is more subtle and concerns the spread of @xmath10 .",
    "1 ) point out that the asymptotic variance in their bernstein ",
    "von mises theorem may not agree with that for @xmath58 based on m - estimation theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  5 ) .",
    "indeed , the maximum likelihood estimator @xmath58 for the misspecified model can be viewed as an m - estimator and will , therefore , be asymptotically normal , with asymptotic variance given by the so - called `` sandwich formula '' which , in this case , gives @xmath60 this follows from the calculations leading up to in the appendix .",
    "up to order @xmath61 , this closely resembles the asymptotic variance in theorem  [ thm : bvm ] ; in particular , if @xmath52 were equal to the term in braces above , then the two variance formulas agree .",
    "note that the genuine bayes posterior has @xmath62 and , therefore , will have asymptotic variance larger than that in the above display .",
    "consequently , the pseudo - bayesian posterior credible intervals would be too large , making the inference inefficient .",
    "section  [ s : correcting ] below describes how we can correct for these two undesirable consequences of misspecification .",
    "as discussed above , there are two effects of the model misspecification on @xmath10 , both depending on the quadratic variation of the jump portion of the process . to deal with these effects , we will need a suitable estimator of the quadratic variation @xmath59 . intuitively , those observed differences @xmath63 which are of relatively large magnitude are likely due to jumps , so a reasonable estimator is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a sequence that vanishes sufficiently slow , and @xmath66 is the indicator function .",
    "we claim that if @xmath67 for some @xmath68 , then @xmath69 for @xmath33-almost all @xmath9 .",
    "results of this type for lvy processes are available in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* fact  3.7 ) , but the proof of given in the appendix under only the finite jump activity assumption is relatively simple . with a suitable estimator in hand ,",
    "now we are ready to address the effects of misspecification .    towards constructing a modified pseudo - posterior for the volatility , we must consider the following question : what is the `` correct / optimal '' asymptotic variance in the normal approximation ?",
    "of course , the best possible inference obtains if the model is not misspecified , i.e. , there are no jumps ; this is equivalent to the case where the sample path of the process is fully observed since , in that case , the jumps are visible and can be removed .",
    "an easy calculations reveals that , in this ideal case , the asymptotic variance is the cramr ",
    "rao bound , @xmath70 .",
    "this optimal variance obtains in theorem  [ thm : bvm ] if @xmath71 this suggests we choose @xmath31 in as @xmath72 so that , by , @xmath53 in @xmath36-probability for @xmath33-almost all @xmath9 . with this understanding",
    ", we define a `` modified '' pseudo - bayesian posterior @xmath73 as the distribution of @xmath74 when @xmath5 is distributed as @xmath10 in , with @xmath31 as in . in other words ,",
    "if @xmath75 is the density function corresponding to @xmath10 , then @xmath73 has density function @xmath76 then we have the following bernstein ",
    "von mises theorem for @xmath73 .",
    "[ thm : fixed ] under the same setup as in theorem  [ thm : bvm ] , for @xmath33-almost all @xmath9 , the modified pseudo - bayesian posterior @xmath73 , with @xmath31 as in , satisfies @xmath77 where @xmath57 is the total variation distance .",
    "the above convergence is also in @xmath33-probability .    since the total variation distance is invariant to location shifts ,",
    "we have that @xmath78 that the right - hand side converges to 0 in @xmath36-probability follows from theorem  [ thm : bvm ] and the particular choice of @xmath31 in .",
    "the @xmath33 convergence is proved just like in theorem  [ thm : bvm ] .",
    "the first observation is that , since @xmath79 is a consistent estimator of @xmath38 , the modified pseudo - posterior is concentrating around the true volatility coefficient , as desired .",
    "furthermore , by our choice of the sequence @xmath31 , the asymptotic variance agrees with that achieved in the ideal case where there are no jumps present or , equivalently , when the sample path of the process is fully observed .",
    "the remaining question is if the posterior variance agrees with the variance of the center @xmath79 under @xmath33 .",
    "proposition  1 in @xcite reveals that , in the present setting , under @xmath36 , the estimator @xmath80 satisfies a central limit theorem , with asymptotic variance @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the credible intervals coming from the modified posterior @xmath73 will be asymptotically valid under @xmath36 , i.e. , the coverage probability of the @xmath81% credible intervals will converge to @xmath82 for @xmath33-almost all @xmath9 .",
    "it follows immediately from the dominated convergence theorem that the coverage probability converges to @xmath82 under @xmath33 as well .",
    "it turns out that the finite - sample performance depends on the choice of threshold @xmath65 in and we address this in section  [ s : numerical ] .",
    "an important question is how to choose the threshold @xmath65 .",
    "the theory says that we need @xmath83 for some @xmath84 and some @xmath85 but , in finite samples , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are not independent parameters ; that is , only the value of @xmath65 matters , not the particular @xmath88 .",
    "this point is discussed at length in ( * ? ? ?",
    "6.2.2 ) , and they suggest one reasonable strategy for choosing @xmath65 .",
    "we consider here a simpler approach based on outlier detection .",
    "that is , let @xmath89 denote the interquartile range of the observed increment magnitudes @xmath90 ; this value is likely to be small since almost all of the increments correspond to the diffusion part of the process .",
    "take @xmath65 to be some value that lower - bounds the set of all @xmath91s that exceeds some cutoff , say , @xmath92 .",
    "we make no claims that this approach is `` optimal '' in any sense , only that it is both simple and reasonable . a thorough investigation of this and the at - sahalia and jacod method for selecting the threshold @xmath65 is beyond the scope of this paper .    for illustration ,",
    "consider the model with drift @xmath93 , volatility @xmath94 , and compound poisson process jumps with a rate of @xmath95 jumps per unit time and jumps sampled from the discrete uniform distribution on @xmath96 with @xmath97 .",
    "we simulate @xmath98 equally spaced observations from this process .",
    "a plot of the observed sample path on the interval @xmath99 $ ] is shown in figure  [ fig : example](a ) with the jump times highlighted by vertical lines .",
    "for the misspecified bayes model , we consider a conjugate inverse gamma prior with shape @xmath100 and rate @xmath101 ; the presence of the temperature parameter @xmath31 does not affect conjugacy .",
    "we also fix @xmath65 based on the interquartile range strategy described above .",
    "figure  [ fig : example](b ) shows the pseudo - posterior density function , the corresponding 95% credible interval for the volatility , and the density function of the normal approximation in theorem  [ thm : fixed ] .",
    "the key observations are that the credible region contains the true volatility in this case and that the modified pseudo - bayes posterior and the normal approximation are very similar .",
    "to further investigate the finite - sample properties our proposed approach for inference on the volatility , we consider a simulation study .",
    "using the same model as above , but varying the jump rate @xmath102 , the jump magnitude @xmath103 , and the sample size @xmath13 , we investigate the coverage probability of the modified pseudo - bayesian credible intervals , based on the choice of threshold mentioned above .",
    "figure  [ fig : sim ] displays the empirical coverage probability , based on 5000 monte carlo simulations in each setting , summarized over the jump rate and standard deviation , for several values of @xmath13 .",
    "this plot reveals that the choice of threshold based on the interquartile range performs reasonably well in this setting , giving coverage probabilities very close to the nominal 95% level .",
    "in this paper we considered the construction of a pseudo - bayes posterior for inference on the volatility in a complex jump diffusion model where the jump distribution is left unspecified .",
    "our strategy here was to misspecify the model on purpose , to avoid dealing directly with a model for the jump portion of the process , and then to correct in some other way for the effects of misspecification .",
    "of course , this `` misspecification on purpose '' strategy could be used in many other problems to provide valid uncertainty quantification for the parameters of interest without having to specify a complete model for the possibly very complex nuisance parameters , which is very attractive .",
    "furthermore , when one has reliable prior information about the interest parameter , it is straightforward to incorporate this into the proposed pseudo - bayesian analysis compared to a fully non - bayesian approach , say , using m - estimation .    for this particular model ,",
    "there are several extensions that one could consider .",
    "for example , if the drift parameter was also of interest , then , instead of ignoring @xmath4 as we did here , it would be relatively straightforward to construct the same modified bayesian posterior for the pair @xmath104 .",
    "more interesting is the case where the volatility parameter is not a scalar constant but , instead , a function @xmath105 .",
    "certain functionals of @xmath105 , in particular , the average volatility @xmath106 , can be inferred directly using virtually the same techniques as presented here , but inference on the function itself would require more .",
    "the authors thank nick syring for some helpful comments on a previous version of the manuscript . a portion of this work",
    "was completed while the first author was with the department of mathematics , statistics , and computer science , at the university of illinois at chicago .",
    "without loss of generality , we will assume in the proof that @xmath107 and @xmath108 . to prove the bernstein ",
    "von mises theorem , follow the approach described in theorem  2.1 of @xcite .",
    "our first objective is to show that @xmath109 \\to 0 , \\quad n \\to \\infty,\\ ] ] for any sequence of constants @xmath110 . to establish this",
    ", we need only to study the posterior mean and variance .",
    "that is , if @xmath111 denotes expectation with respect to the pseudo - posterior , then , by markov s inequality , we have @xmath112 to show that the expectation of the left - hand side in the above display vanishes , it suffices to show that @xmath113 towards this , we will use the laplace approximation which says that , for suitable functions @xmath114 , the posterior mean of @xmath115 is @xmath116 therefore , in our case , if we apply the above to @xmath117 , then we have @xmath118 since the log - likelihood function for our misspecified model has a unique maximum @xmath58 in the interior of the @xmath5-space and satisfies @xmath119 , the big - oh term above is uniform in observations , i.e. , the @xmath120 term in the above display is a function of @xmath34 that can be uniformly bounded by a constant times @xmath61 and , in particular , the scaling by @xmath121 does not affect this conclusion .",
    "therefore , to get , it suffices to show that @xmath122 towards showing , we recall that @xmath123 where , under @xmath36 , @xmath34 are independent with @xmath124 and @xmath125 are defined in .",
    "it follows that @xmath58 has the same distribution as @xmath126 times a non - central chi - square random variable , @xmath127 , with @xmath13 degrees of freedom and non - centrality parameter @xmath128 .",
    "in particular , @xmath129 if we let @xmath42 denote variance with respect to @xmath36 , then we have that @xmath130 plugging in the formulas for the mean and variance of @xmath127 and simplifying , gives @xmath131 this is clearly @xmath120 , so we have established . note that this derivation depends on @xmath9 only through @xmath132 and @xmath59 .",
    "since implies , we have proved the claimed pseudo - posterior concentration rate result .",
    "next , we need to demonstrate that the model is suitably regular .",
    "more specifically , theorem  2.1 in @xcite require that the model satisfies a certain local asymptotic normality property , i.e. , the log - likelihood ratio has a quadratic approximation locally around the specified @xmath55 .",
    "since the misspecified model is so nice , it is a straightforward exercise to show that @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "the above display holds uniformly on compact subsets of @xmath136 , and it follows from that @xmath137 is bounded in @xmath36-probability .",
    "therefore , the assertion in theorem  [ thm : bvm ] follows from kleijn and van der vaart s .",
    "the extension of these results to the unconditional distribution , @xmath33 , is also straightforward .",
    "based on the finite jump activity assumption , all that we demonstrated above holds with @xmath33-probability 1 .",
    "in particular , we have that , for any @xmath138 , @xmath139 since this sequence is bounded and converges almost surely , it follows from the dominated convergence theorem that @xmath140 \\to 0,\\ ] ] i.e. , @xmath141 in @xmath33-probability .      for @xmath33-almost all @xmath9",
    ", we have that @xmath34 are independent under @xmath36 with @xmath142 where @xmath125 are given in and @xmath49 only for those indices @xmath50 .",
    "to prove the claim in equation , we split the indices to those that contain a jump ( in @xmath47 ) and those that do not ( in @xmath143 ) .",
    "then we get @xmath144 take absolute value of both sides , apply the triangle inequality , and then take expectation .",
    "this yields the inequality @xmath145 we will proceed by showing , one by one , that each of the four terms in the upper bound above is @xmath146 . first , note that @xmath147 are iid and hence its fourth moment is bounded by a constant independent of @xmath13 .",
    "then we have , by the cauchy  schwartz inequality @xmath148 it is clear that @xmath149 is of order @xmath13 .",
    "so we only need to find a good bound for the tail probability .",
    "assume , for the moment , that @xmath150 .",
    "using the usual normal tail probability bounds , we get @xmath151 so , if @xmath67 , for @xmath68 , then the upper bound for the above tail probability is @xmath152 for any positive integer @xmath153 .",
    "hence it follows easily @xmath154 the same conclusion can be reached if @xmath155 .",
    "next , @xmath156 and , similarly , using cauchy ",
    "schwartz , @xmath157 for the last term , we need to bound @xmath158 .",
    "again , without loss of generality , if we assume that @xmath150 and @xmath159 , then we get @xmath160 which , using the normal tail probability bound again , is bounded by @xmath161 since @xmath159 is a fixed constant , the above quantity vanishes exponentially fast , so @xmath162 all four terms have been shown to be @xmath146 , completing the proof of .",
    "finally , note that the result holds for all @xmath9 such that @xmath132 and @xmath163 are finite .",
