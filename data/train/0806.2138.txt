    "sensitive multi - band surveys in the optical and near - infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum have proven extremely successful in identifying large and diverse galaxy populations in the high - redshift universe .",
    "deep images obtained through optical _ u@xmath8gr _ filters , for example , readily find @xmath9 galaxies by the presence of a strong 912   lyman break ( e.g. , steidel et al .",
    "lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) tend to be massive galaxies with star formation rates ( sfr ) between @xmath10 m@xmath5 yr@xmath11 and relatively low dust obscuration .",
    "similarly , unobscured star forming disk ( s - bzk galaxies ) and passively evolving spheroidal galaxies at @xmath12 can be discerned from the myriad background sources by their optical / near - infrared colors or other magnitude - color criteria ( see , e.g. , daddi et al . 2004 ; adelberger et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the s - bzk galaxies in particular tend to possess large stellar masses ( @xmath4 m@xmath5 ) with sfr @xmath13 m@xmath5 yr@xmath11 .",
    "nevertheless , it had been long suspected that a substantial fraction of luminous @xmath14 galaxies powered by star formation or accretion onto super - massive black holes would not be identified using these and related techniques because of heavy dust obscuration , but would turn up instead at infrared , sub - millimeter , and radio wavelengths ( see , e.g. , chary & elbaz 2001 and references within ) .",
    "indeed , deep but small - area surveys at sub - millimeter wavelengths by scuba ( e.g. , smail et al . 1997 ) revealed a population of extremely dusty galaxies at @xmath15 , whose high luminosities are generally though to originate primarily in star formation ( sfr @xmath16 m@xmath5 yr@xmath11 ) , though a small fraction may be agn dominated .",
    "galaxies powered by starbursts or active nuclei ( agn ) can also be strong emitters at radio wavelengths through either large populations of supernova remnants or accretion disk phenomena .",
    "even though this emission is unaffected by obscuration , roughly @xmath17 of compact radio sources identified in deep radio surveys have either extremely faint optical counterparts or none at all ( e.g. , richards et al . 1999 ; fomalont et al .",
    "2002 ) , and may represent distant luminous obscured starburst or agn powered galaxies .",
    "such objects make a still unknown contribution to the luminosity , chemical , and accretion history of the universe .",
    "determining an accurate census of heavily obscured sources - their redshifts , luminosities , space densities , and dominant power source - is one of the key issues in observational astrophysics and a primary objective of the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( _ spitzer _ ; werner et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "a number of ambitious large area multi - wavelength surveys incorporating _ spitzer _ data have been conducted to date .",
    "these include the _ great observatories origins deep survey _ ( goods ) , the _ spitzer wide - area infrared extra - galactic _ survey ( swire ) , and the _ first look survey _ ( fls ) .",
    "this paper is concerned with the nature of infrared and radio selected sources with extremely faint optical counterparts originally selected from the _ noao deep wide - field survey _ ( ndwfs ) in botes ( jannuzi & dey 1999)with the expectation that they are either heavily extincted , at high redshift , or both .",

    "these observations reached a flux density limit of @xmath19 @xmath0jy ( @xmath20 ) at the three overlapping pointing centers . to be considered optically `` invisible ''",
    ", a radio source must have no @xmath21 , @xmath22 , or @xmath23 counterpart within a 1.5   radius .",
    "this corresponds to limiting @xmath24 magnitudes of approximately 26.9 , 25.6 , and 24.9 ( vega ; 2  aperture ) respectively , with the precise value depending upon location within the optical survey .",

    "photometric redshifts are also possible by virtue of the rest - frame 1.6 @xmath0 m peak arising from the h@xmath35 opacity minimum in the photospheres of evolved stars .",
    "it is our aim to derive basic properties for both optically `` invisible '' source populations , including rest - frame near - infrared luminosities and seds , and to determine , for example , if their rest - frame near - infrared emission is dominated by starlight or an agn .",
    "only then would it be possible to relate oimss and oirss to other high - z populations .",
    "it is also our intent to use the irac images to explore the near environments of oimss and oirss for additional clues to their nature and evolution .",

    "these results are summarized in @xmath37 . throughout this paper",
    "we will refer to the oirss and oimss by number ( i.e. , oirs # 97 or oims # 13 ) , corresponding to their entries in table 2 of higdon05 and table 1 of houck05 .",
    "source coordinates can be found from those papers directly , or through their simbad designations , [ hhw2005 ]  # and [ hsw2005 ]  # for the oirss and oimss respectively .",
    "we assume a flat @xmath38cdm cosmology , with @xmath39=0.27 , @xmath40=0.73 , and a hubble constant of 71 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 .",
    "flux densities or limits at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath0 m for the oirss and oimss were extracted from the final irac shallow survey mosaics ( pipeline version s11 ) using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) with 4.8   diameter apertures .",
    "all sources are nearly point - like , and point - source aperture corrections were applied .",
    "the 3.6 @xmath0 m images were used for matching the radio and 24 @xmath0 m selected source positions since they had the highest point source sensitivity ( @xmath41 = 6.4 @xmath0jy ( @xmath20 ) in a 4  diameter aperture ) and angular resolution ( @xmath42 fwhm ) . to qualify as a `` match '' the coordinates of an oims or oirs had to agree with an irac 3.6 @xmath0 m source to within @xmath43 .",
    "we decided upon this match radius after comparing the radio and @xmath44 mjy mips catalogs with the irac shallow survey catalog .",
    "for example , 2/3 of the compact 20 cm radio sources ( excluding the oirss ) had a 3.6 @xmath0 m source counterpart centered within @xmath45 .",
    "since the great majority of these matches are real we took @xmath45 to represent the @xmath46 relative positional accuracy between the radio and irac 3.6 @xmath0 m catalogs . a similar value ( @xmath47 )",
    "was found for the @xmath46 relative positional accuracy between the @xmath44 mjy mips sources and 3.6 @xmath0 m counterparts in the shallow survey .",
    "the match radius of @xmath43 , while seemingly small , represents essentially a @xmath48 criterion , i.e. , we would expect @xmath49 radio / irac mismatch out of the full 377 compact radio source sample . as a consequence , oimss and oirss",
    "can be said to lack irac counterparts at the @xmath48 level if no 3.6 @xmath0 m sources are within @xmath43 , and at the @xmath50 level if there are none within @xmath51 .",
    "the original count of oirss in higdon05 was thirty - six .",
    "however , we are no longer confident that # 362 is a clear - cut oirs . as a result",
    ", we will not include it in the following analysis .",
    "of the remaining thirty - five oirss within the irac shallow survey , nineteen ( 54@xmath52 ) were unambiguously detected at 3.6 @xmath0 m as shown in figure 1 .",
    "even when a potential optical counterpart exists within @xmath53 ( e.g. , # 97 & 410 ) the compact radio source sits squarely on an irac source . of these , six ( 17@xmath52 )",
    "were detected in three irac bands to @xmath54 ( oirs @xmath5579 , 176 , 208 , 245 , 346 , and 349 ) , and two ( @xmath55176 and 349 ) in all four . the median 3.6 @xmath0 m and 4.5 @xmath0 m flux densities for these nineteen objects are 18.3 @xmath0jy and 22.5 @xmath0jy , respectively . sixteen oirss were found to lack irac counterparts within @xmath43 and are shown in figure 2 .",
    "note that in four instances ( @xmath559 , 305 , 430 , and 441 ) possible irac counterparts are present roughly @xmath56 away .",
    "oirss @xmath559 , 305 , and 441 are particularly suspicious as their candidate irac matches are also optically `` invisible '' , i.e. , like the 19 oirss with clear irac counterparts .",
    "the coordinate mismatches in these instances however equal or exceed the radio / irac relative positional accuracy at the @xmath50 level .",
    "moreover , the expected number of oirss in figure 2 with an optically `` invisible '' irac source @xmath56 away due to chance is @xmath57 , given the estimated density of 3.6 @xmath0 m sources with no optical counterparts ( 3.3 arcmin@xmath58 ) in the shallow survey .",
    "we conclude that these four oirss are unlikely to be physically associated with the relatively nearby irac sources . however , even if we allow these four matches , it remains true that a significant fraction ( at least 12/35 or 34@xmath52 ) of the oirss lack clear 3.6@xmath0 m counterparts in the irac shallow survey .",
    "it should also be noted that while the radio source morphologies in figures 1 and 2 are for the most part quite simple , extended radio emission may have been lost due to a lack of short spacings ( though the 4.5-hours spent at each pointing center in the a - array observations should reliably represent emission up to @xmath59 scale - sizes ) or @xmath60 surface brightness dimming that _ might _ otherwise have connected an oirs to an optical or infrared source .",
    "observations in more compact array configurations will be needed to resolve this issue . with these caveats in mind , stack averages of the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0",
    "@xmath0 m images at the radio source positions led to flux density upper - limits of 1.5 , 2.0 , 10.1 , and 11.0 @xmath0jy ( @xmath24 ) for the sixteen oirss with no apparent irac counterparts .",
    "oims @xmath5511 was not included in this study due to its uncertain redshift .",

    "the median 3.6 @xmath0 m and 4.5 @xmath0 m flux densities for the fifteen oimss observed in all four irac bands are 17.0 @xmath0jy and 26.1 @xmath0jy , i.e. , quite similar to that of the nineteen irac detected oirss",
    ". however , a much higher fraction of these oimss ( 12/15 or 80@xmath52 ) were detected in all four irac bands .",
    "the oimss are also significantly brighter at 8.0 @xmath0 m than the oirss : the median oims @xmath61 is 136 @xmath0jy , while the median @xmath61 for the nine oirss detected in this band is 37 @xmath0jy .",
    "the oimss were chosen from the mips 24 @xmath0 m catalog to satisfy @xmath62 @xmath63 0.75 mjy , and the sources in table 2 have a median @xmath62 of 1.1 mjy .",
    "by contrast , only four oirss were detected at 24 @xmath0 m at @xmath20 or higher ( oirs @xmath5597 , 176 , 245 , and 363 ) , with a mean @xmath62 of 0.38 mjy .",

    "no oirss or oimss were detected with mips at 70 @xmath0 m or 160 @xmath0 m , placing @xmath24 upper - limits of 24 mjy and 60 mjy at these two wavelengths .",

    "2001 ) , and elliptical ( silva et al . 1998 ) galaxies . for each oirs",
    ", the templates were redshifted from @xmath65 in steps of 0.05 , re - gridded and scaled to the observed flux densities .",
    "redshifts were determined by minimizing the reduced @xmath66 , defined as @xmath67 where o@xmath68 and t@xmath69 are the observed and template flux densities , n@xmath70 are the degrees of freedom , and @xmath71 is a scaling constant calculated at each value of z. the optical and far - infrared upper - limits were included in the @xmath72 calculation only when they were exceeded by the template flux density ( i.e. , when @xmath71t@xmath73 o@xmath68 ) .",
    "when this occurred o@xmath68 was set to the respective limit and @xmath72 was calculated as above .",
    "formal uncertainties in @xmath64 were estimated by numerically evaluating @xmath74 additional extinction corresponding to a@xmath75 = 1 - 2 ( assuming a screen geometry and the galactic reddening law in mathis 1990 ) was typically required to satisfy the optical constraints .",
    "this was applied to the template in equation 1 prior to redshifting .    as a test",
    ", we determined photometric redshifts for the four oimss that houck05 fit with either an arp  220 or ngc  7714 spectral template ( oims @xmath552 , 7 , 12 , and 14 in table 2 ) .",
    "the minimum-@xmath76 fits are shown in figure 4 along with the corresponding photometric redshifts .",
    "we find good agreement between the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts of all four , with @xmath77 = 0.1 , 0.1 , 0.1 and 0.3 , respectively .",
    "the arp  220 template with an additional @xmath78 magnitudes of visual extinction provided the best fits for all four , including oims @xmath552 , whose irs spectrum was classified as a starburst ( ngc  7714 ) by houck05 .",
    "starburst templates gave similar @xmath64 for this source , but produced too little emission at 8.0 @xmath0 m and 24 @xmath0 m , implying the presence of an additional dust component in the rest - frame mid - ir .",
    "the fact that oimss # 12 & 14 are significantly brighter than the arp  220 template in the 24 @xmath0 m band may reflect stronger pah emission in these sources .",
    "again , similar photometric redshifts were obtained using the m  82 template and down - weighting the 24 @xmath0 m measurements , however only the arp  220 template could match the observed @xmath79 .",
    "the remaining oimss in table 2 either lacked a sufficient number of data points for template fitting ( e.g. , @xmath555 , 10 , and 17 ) or possessed power - law seds , for which unambiguous redshift determinations were not possible .",
    "photometric redshifts were derived for six oirss : @xmath5597 , 176 , 208 , 245 , 349 , and 363 .",
    "each was detected in at least three irac and mips bands to @xmath54 .",
    "the minimum-@xmath76 fits are shown in figure 5 , along with the best matching template and derived @xmath64 .",
    "the results are summarized in table 3 . in each case",
    "we are fitting the inflection point in the spectrum where the dominant emission source changes from evolved stars to warm dust . for oirs",
    "@xmath55363 the inflection point is implied by the upper - limits in the irac 5.8 @xmath0 m and 8.0 @xmath0 m bands , which effectively rule out a power - law between 3.6 @xmath0 m and 24 @xmath0 m .",
    "the derived redshifts range from 1.0 to 4.5 with a mean of 2.2 .",
    "the formal redshift uncertainty is @xmath80 , though a comparable contribution to the error budget may arise from our ignorance of the source s true sed .",
    "for example ,",
    "oirss @xmath5597 and 245 would have been detected at 160 @xmath0 m to @xmath81 had the arp  220 template accurately represented their far - infrared seds .",
    "( a more in depth analysis employing a larger set of templates and extinction laws is not warranted at this point given the paucity of data points . )",
    "the six oirss are best represented by either the starburst m  82 ( @xmath55176 , 208 , and 349 ) or the starburst / agn composite arp  220 ( @xmath5597 , 245 , and 363 ) templates . in each case",
    "the best fitting template was unambiguous .",
    "in particular , the agn - dominated galaxy templates make poor matches to the seds in figure 5 .",
    "likewise , elliptical galaxy templates are ruled out by the detection of emission at 24 @xmath0 m .",
    "this sub - sample of oirss detected both with irac and with mips at 24 @xmath0 m represents a population of sources with a significant starburst component with a redshift range similar to the oimss .",
    "two other oirss , @xmath5579 and 346 , permitted rough photo-@xmath82 estimates .",
    "minimum-@xmath76 fits are shown in figure 6 .",
    "for @xmath5579 , the flat irac spectrum could reasonably be interpreted as the rest - frame @xmath831 - 3 @xmath0 m region , consistent with redshifts between @xmath84 .",
    "in fact , the smallest @xmath76 is achieved with a starburst ( m  82 ) template at @xmath64= 1.6 with one magnitude of additional extinction .",
    "an arp  220-like sed appears to be ruled out unless the 9.7 @xmath0 m silicate absorption feature in these sources is much deeper than the template .",
    "we emphasize that these redshifts are approximate , as @xmath85 also yields a small @xmath66 .",
    "the second oirs in figure 6 , @xmath55346 , shows a fairly steep power - law shape ( @xmath86 = -2.1 , for @xmath87 ) in the irac data that does not extend to the mips 24 @xmath0 m band .",
    "if this spectral break occurs at rest - frame wavelengths of 1 - 2 @xmath0 m , then redshifts exceeding 3 are implied , and a reasonable fit using the m  82 and arp  220 template at @xmath88 are possible , as is shown in figure 6 .",
    "note that good fits also result using the elliptical template for both , since the 24 @xmath0 m upper - limit provides no constraint to the shape of the sed . in both cases ,",
    "the derived @xmath64 is close to that derived using m  82 or arp  220 .",
    "because these redshifts are only estimates , we do not include them in table 3 .",
    "overall , no starburst , agn , or composite template could be found that would permit a fitted @xmath64 of less than one for the above eight oirss . at the very least ,",
    "a significant fraction of oirss are at high redshift . while galaxy templates with a sizable young stellar component ( i.e. , arp  220 or m  82 ) are consistent with the data , early - type galaxies can not be ruled out in the two cases where there are no 24 @xmath0 m detections ( figure 6 ) .",
    "there are insufficient data to determine photometric redshifts for the remaining oirss in table 1 .",

    "the slope is still steep compared to seds of unobscured agn ( e.g. , elvis et al .",

    "2004 ) , for which @xmath99 over @xmath100  .",
    "the steep seds suggest a distribution of dust mass that rises rapidly with distance from the central heating source , and the break in the _ obssy2 _ sed suggests that the rapid rise ends at a distance corresponding to @xmath101  k. the absence of pah emission in the irs spectra of these objects is consistent with the agn interpretation of the emission .",
    "the _ sb _ sed rises about as steeply ( @xmath102 ) as the _ obssy1 _ sed in the rest - frame 18  spectral range , though with only one object the slope is poorly determined .",
    "a 1.6  bump can be seen in the irac data , indicating that the rest - frame 13  emission arises primarily from evolved stars .",
    "the steep rise at longer wavelengths is characteristic of dust in star formation regions .",
    "in contrast , the average sed for _ comb _ objects is much shallower for @xmath103 between 1 - 3  , @xmath104 , with a steeper rise from rest 3 to 8  .",
    "the lack of a prominent 1.6  bump suggests a power - law agn component contributes much of the rest - frame @xmath105 @xmath0 m flux , and the steepening suggests the presence of dust associated with the starburst , consistent with the dual starburst / agn nature of these objects .",
    "the average sed for the six irac - detected oirss with photometric redshifts is also shown in figure  7 .",
    "this sed resembles the _ sb _ class by virtue of the clear 1.6 @xmath0 m bump .",
    "however , the steep rise for @xmath103 between 3 - 10 @xmath0 m may reflect a combination of star formation plus a weak active nucleus .",

    "the similar luminosities , implied star formation rates and stellar masses , faint optical magnitudes , and sed shapes is evidence that at least a fraction of the oimss and irac detected oirss are members of the same parent population as the `` cold '' ( i.e. , starburst dominated ) smgs .",

    "it is also apparent that with two exceptions , the oimss and the `` warm '' and `` cold '' smgs obey the radio - infrared correlation within the uncertainties .",
    "oimss , oirss , and smgs thus occupy distinct regions in a radio / infrared two - color diagram , though there is also considerable overlap , particularly between the oimss and smgs .",
    "this overlap is further illustrated in figure 11 , where l@xmath3 is plotted against @xmath231 .",
    "a clear progression is seen , with luminous and flat - spectrum `` cold '' smgs ( i.e. , l@xmath3 @xmath235 l@xmath120 and @xmath236 ) giving way to _",
    "obssy1 _ oimss and `` warm '' smgs ( l@xmath3 @xmath30 few @xmath121 @xmath237 l@xmath120 and @xmath238 ) , and finally to the steep power - law _ obssy2 _ oimss ( l@xmath3 @xmath239 10@xmath31 l@xmath120 and @xmath240 ) .",
    "this suggests that the oimss , a subset of the irac detected oirss , and the smgs are all taken from the same population of dusty hyper - luminous high-@xmath82 objects .",
    "the chief difference between them is the dominant emission mechanism : _ obssy1 _ and _ obssy2 _ oimss in particular can be thought of as analogs of smgs sources whose luminosities in the rest - frame near and mid - ir are dominated by powerful and heavily obscured active nuclei accreting near the eddington limit .",
    "figure 10 also illustrates a dichotomy between the irac detected oirss with and without redshifts ( i.e. , those with and without 24 @xmath0 m detections ) . with one exception ,",
    "all of the former are characterized by @xmath241 , which is consistent with systems dominated by star formation , a radio - quiet agn , or a combination of the two . by contrast , the remaining irac detected oirss all have negative _",
    "q_-values indicating an increasingly dominant radio - loud active nucleus .",
    "the parent oirs population is similarly dominated by radio - loud active nuclei , for excluding the six oirss with @xmath64 , 72% of the sources in table 1 of higdon05 have negative _",
    "q_. this suggests that the 24 @xmath0 m detected oirss in figure 5 are not representative of the larger oirss population , but rather form a starburst dominated sub - group .",
    "results from the previous sections suggest that the _ obssy1_/_obssy2 _ oimss and `` cold '' smgs are members of the same parent population of heavily obscured hyper - luminous galaxies , with the fundamental difference being their dominant power source , i.e. , either accretion near the eddington limit or star formation .",
    "the _ obssy1 _ and _ obssy2 _ oimss in particular can be thought of as heavily obscured qsos . while it is true that very few smgs contain `` buried '' qsos ( @xmath242 , almaini et al .",
    "2003 ) , recent ultra - deep x - ray observations argue persuasively that many smgs contain massive central black holes and luminous , though not yet dominant , active nuclei .",
    "for example , @xmath243 of the smgs with radio counterparts and known redshifts in the chandra deep field north were detected in hard x - rays by alexander et al .",
    "their x - ray luminosities ( l@xmath244 w ) , levels of obscuration ( eighty percent show n@xmath245 cm@xmath58 ) , and spectral power - law exponents ( @xmath246 ) are similar to nearby powerful agn",
    ". however , their x - ray to infrared luminosity ratios ( l@xmath247/l@xmath248 ) are typically an order of magnitude smaller than qsos , consistent with intense star formation ( sfr@xmath249 m@xmath5 yr@xmath11 ) providing the bulk of their luminosity",
    ". this may be simply saying that that the x - ray detected smgs are currently accreting at substantially sub - eddington rates , which would imply that the only real difference between the _ obssy1_/_obssy2 _ oimss and `` cold '' smgs is the rate at which material is transfered to the central engine . on the other hand , near - ir spectra of smgs",
    "typically show that when broad rest - frame optical lines are present they are typically only @xmath250 km s@xmath11 wide ( cf .",
    "swinbank et al .",
    "2004 ) , which is consistent with only _ modest _ black hole masses , i.e. , @xmath251 m@xmath5 .",
    "it is thus possible ( though admittedly speculative ) that what distinguishes the agn powered oimss and `` cold '' smgs is primarily the central black hole mass rather than simply the accretion rate .    given the well established correlation between the masses of the spheroid and central black hole in local galaxies ( e.g. , kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) and the evidence linking the smg population with current epoch massive ellipticals ( e.g. , smail , ivison , & blain 1997 ; barger et al . 1998 ; barger et al . 1999 ) , it is intriguing to consider the possibility that the _ obssy1 _ and _ obssy2 _ oimss represent smgs that have made the transition from a starburst dominated `` cold '' phase to an accretion dominated `` buried '' qso phase . a plausible mechanism for this transition would be the growth of a sufficiently massive black hole ( in parallel with the stellar bulge ) during the high - sfr `` cold '' phase , with the subsequent transfer of material to the central regions through tidal interactions or mergers .",
    "the energy released during this relatively brief phase would act to expell the obscuring gas and dust from the central regions , effectively halting the growth of the bulge and super - massive black hole and `` unveiling '' a qso in the manner envisoned by sanders et al .",
    "( 1988 ) .",
    "smgs and oimss appear to have have very different mean space densities .",
    "if so , this would have important implications for the envisoned smg - qso transition .",
    "for example , the number of smgs per square degree with @xmath252 mjy ( which we take to represent the hyper - luminous sources ) is @xmath30400 using the cumulative 850 @xmath0 m source count formulation in sanders ( 2000 ) .",
    "assuming they all lie between @xmath15 , their average space density becomes @xmath253 mpc@xmath254 .",
    "there are seventy sources in the ndwfs botes field satisfying @xmath255 mjy and @xmath256 , i.e. , oimss by our definition , of which fifty - eight have been observed by _",
    "spitzer_. forty - five of these oimss can be confidently classified as _",
    "obssy1 _ or _",
    "obsssy2 _ on the basis of their irs spectra and/or steep power - law infrared seds ( higdon et al . in preparation ) . over half of these sources",
    "have @xmath257 on the basis of irs observations , and the remainder have irac / mips seds _",
    "consistent _ with this redshift range .",
    "there are thus @xmath258 _",
    "obssy1 _ and _ obssy2 _ oimss in the 8.5 deg@xmath18 ndwfs . assuming that the oimss with no redshift measurements are within @xmath15",
    ", we estimate a mean space density of @xmath259 mpc@xmath254 for this population , or nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath260 .",
    "this could be simply explained if the duration of the `` buried '' qso phase is short compared with the smg s `` cold '' phase , i.e. , the time spent growing a sufficiently massive black hole and bulge .",
    "one caveat to the above analysis is the sensitivity of @xmath260 to the adopted 850 @xmath0 m flux density cut - off . for example , if only the @xmath261 mjy smgs pass through a _",
    "obssy1 _ or _ obssy2 _",
    "phase , then @xmath262 mpc@xmath254 , and @xmath263 .",
    "the sub - millimeter properties of the oims population are largely unknown , and it is not certain whether oimss with @xmath255 mjy map onto smgs with f@xmath264 mjy , or for that matter , smgs with f@xmath265 mjy . despite these uncertainties , it appears likely that @xmath266 .",
    "this suggests that if indeed the _",
    "obssy1 _ and _ obssy2 _ oimss represent a transition from smgs to qsos , and eventually to current epoch massive elliptical galaxies , it is a relatively rapid one .",
    "evidence that the near environment of galaxies plays a role in triggering active nuclei has been known for some time .",
    "heckman et al . ( 1984 , 1986 ) , for example , found that a large fraction of low redshift quasars have companion galaxies within @xmath164 that typically differ in radial velocity from the quasar by @xmath267 km s@xmath11 .",
    "in addition , roughly one - third of radio galaxies show highly peculiar morphologies ( i.e. , tails , bridges , and shells ) indicative of tidal interactions .",
    "more recent work supports these results ( e.g. , canalizo & stockton 2001 ) .",
    "the 3.6 @xmath0 m images in figure 1 suggest that most irac detected oirss possess close companions , and may therefore be tidally interacting .",
    "if so , this implies that like low redshift radio galaxies , the central activity in the majority of the irac detected oirss may be induced through collisions .",
    "the fact that most oimss appear point - like with irac might at first suggest that they are relatively isolated .",
    "however , the mid - ir images shown in figure 3 can not exclude the possibility that oimss possess faint or lower - mass companions capable of inducing tidal perturbations large enough to fuel an active nucleus .",
    "nor can the irac images rule out the possibility that oimss are a population of late - state mergers .",
    "local examples , such as ngc  7252 , typically show luminous asymmetric cores with extended low surface brightness tails ( schweizer 1982 )",
    ". neither would be detectable with irac given the oims s redshifts .",
    "it thus remains an interesting possibility that interactions have triggered the nuclear activity in both oirss and oimss .",
    "deep and high angular resolution near - infrared imaging studies will be needed to test this hypothesis .",
    "oimss can be split into two populations based on their rest - frame 1 - 10 @xmath0 m seds and irac colors in concordance with their irs spectra : most ( 12/16 ) are dominated by a heavily obscured radio - quiet active nucleus , while the remainder are powered by either a starburst or a composite starburst / active nucleus .",
    "the agn dominated _",
    "obssy1 _ and _ obssy2 _ oimss in particular are extremely luminous in the rest - frame near and mid - ir , with @xmath224l@xmath225(5 @xmath0 m ) comparable to the most luminous local nlrgs and quasars",
    ". they can be regarded as `` buried '' qsos and likely represent the predecesors of current epoch massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "oimss are also distinct from other high - z source populations routinely selected using uv / optical or optical / near - infrared criteria such as lbgs and bzks in their dominant power source , levels of obscuration , and mid - ir luminosity .",
    "compared with other optically faint mid - ir selected populations ( e.g. , yan et al . 2007 ) , oimss represent extremes in both obscuration and agn luminosity .",
    "this follows from their respecive selection criteria , which for oimss favor steeper mid - ir continuua and higher levels of extinction .",
    "there appears to be significant overlap between oimss and smgs , with the _ sb / comb _ oimss appearing largely indistinguishable from smgs in their optical , mid - infrared , and radio properties .",
    "moreover , the _ obssy1 _ and _ obssy2 _ oimss may represent a brief obscured phase in the transition of a `` cold '' smg to a qso , and eventually to a massive current epoch elliptical galaxy .",
    "the oirss do not represent a single source population .",
    "the minority ( 6/35 ) that are detected by both irac and mips at 24 @xmath0 m have seds , mid - ir colors , and _",
    "q_-values indicative of either starburst or composite starburst / agn powered systems . for these sources",
    "we find @xmath64 in between 1.0 and 4.5 , implying rest - frame k - band luminosities , maximum star formation rates , and stellar masses virtually identical to the `` cold '' ( i.e. , starburst dominated ) smgs in the lockman hole east region .    the remaining oirss - which comprise @xmath268 of the parent population in higdon05 - fall into two classes depending upon whether or not they are detected by irac .",
    "those that are detected have flat mid - ir seds implying comparable luminosities from stellar photospheres and hot agn illuminated dust . as a group ,",
    "their average l@xmath269/l@xmath270 ratio is most consistent with either low excitation radio galaxies ( lergs ) or objects like the `` red and dead '' radio galaxy lbds 53w091 .",
    "those that are not detected by irac must be at @xmath6 if they are as massive as the hosts of local radio sources .",
    "both of these groups are characterized by negative values of _ q _ and thus may represent a population of _ relatively _ unobscured radio galaxies at high redshift .",
    "both represent populations that are highly distinct from the _ obssy1 _ and _ obssy2 _ oimss .    differences between the optically _ invisible",
    "_ populations detected through observations at sub - millimeter , mid - ir and radio wavelengths can be understood in terms of selection effects : ( 1 ) extreme optical / mid - ir luminosity ratios appears to ensure highly obscured agn dominated sources ( _ obssy1 _ and _ obssy2 _ oimss ) , ( 2 ) extreme optical / sub - millimeter luminosity ratios will select highly obscured sources primarily powered by star formation ( scuba / mambo sources ) , and ( 3 ) compact sub - mjy radio sources lacking optical counterparts appears to preferentially choose distant bl lac - like objects ( oirss ) .",
    "we find no evidence that oimss or oirss inhabit the cores of rich clusters . nor do we find significant differences in local galaxy density between the two on @xmath271 kpc scales .",
    "however , unlike the oimss , a large fraction of the irac detected oirss appear to possess close and massive companions , though higher angular resolution studies will be needed to reach firm conclusions .",
    "this suggests that the luminosity of oirss ( and conceivably oimss ) may be triggered by tidal interactions , as appears to be the case for low-@xmath82 radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "the irac detected oirss may thus represent the formation of very massive galaxies at high redshift through major mergers .",
