    "the snowmass young physicists ( syp ) @xcite was first organized at the community planning meeting held at fermilab in october of 2012 .",
    "this group was formed to provide a conduit for young ( nontenured ) particle physicists to participate in the forthcoming community summer study ( known as snowmass on the mississippi ) which took place in the summer of 2013 in minneapolis , mn .    the primary charge taken up by",
    "the syp was to facilitate and encourage young people to get involved with physics studies and meetings in preparation for snowmass on the mississippi .",
    "the syp generated an online platform ( http://snowmassyoung.hep.net ) as well as an offline network for advertising tasks that need to be done and connecting interested syp members with the relevant frontiers .",
    "this was accomplished by having our members attend many of the `` pre - snowmass '' meetings across the frontiers . while at these meetings , dedicated parallel sessions were arranged with remote participation to provide a platform for discussion and input .",
    "invited speakers from the fermilab directorate , department of energy ( doe ) , national science foundation ( nsf ) , as well as senior scientists and faculty came to speak with a broad section of the young community .",
    "in addition to these meetings , over a dozen syp town hall meetings were held prior to snowmass during which plans and concerns were raised .",
    "the second charge is related to a `` deliverable '' to the community summer study .",
    "the syp gathered information about demographics , career outlook , physics outlook , planned experiments , and general concerns of young physicists in the form of an online survey @xcite .",
    "this information is intended to provide a voice to the next generation of leaders in high energy physics ( hep ) and serve as a basis for discussion with senior physicists , politicians , and funding agencies about the current and future state the field .",
    "additionally the opinions expressed here represent many people who were unable to attend snowmass on the mississippi personally .",
    "the results of this survey consititute the majority of this paper .",
    "the next charge of the syp is to become a long term asset to young physicists .",
    "this is done through multiple channels such as providing information and resources to people in high energy physics when they are making career decisions .",
    "this includes , but is not limited to , information about current and planned scientific experiments and collaborations , having cross - frontier talks and seminars , and providing information and resources for those who decide to take the many skills learned in physics out into the general work force .",
    "furthermore , the syp will make efforts to engage members of congress from the many districts in which the syp members live and help lobby for the interests of young people in hep .",
    "moreover , the syp aims to provide a chance for young physicists to network and meet each other as well as become known outside of each of our particular subfields .    beyond the above listed tasks",
    ", syp has made contact with individuals who have recently left hep for non - academic career paths . through gathering information about their experiences",
    "we can illustrate the broader positive impact members of hep have on the wider u.s . after leaving the field .",
    "moreover this information can serve as an example for career opportunities of current would - be physicists in the future .",
    "in addition to the online survey that was taken leading up to snowmass , a follow - up document is availabe for people who know the contact information for those who have left hep ( http://snowmassyoung.hep.net/oa_contacts.pdf ) .    the mechanism of young scientists organizing to provide input into the snowmass process is not a new phenomenon , as a group organized during snowmass 2001 and became known as the young particle physicists ( ypp ) @xcite .",
    "the ypp also administered a survey in order to collect the opinions and concerns of many in hep @xcite .",
    "this work became the basis for the syp in 2013 who were in fact helped a great deal by these original scientists , many of whom have moved into leadership roles across hep .",
    "this paper is dedicated to showing a summary of the results of the syp 2013 survey .",
    "the data on which these results are based is now publicly available ( http://snowmassyoung.hep.net/syp2013_publicdata.tar.gz ) .",

    "section [ sec : demo ] will present the results from the demographic information collected in the survey . in section [ sec : careeroutlook ] we present results pertaining to the opinions of peoples career outlook in hep .",
    "more generally , subsection [ sec : spires ] helps frame this discussion in terms of available and filled jobs as reported by spires data @xcite @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : physicsoutlook ] presents results pertaining to opinions on the physics prospects in hep including information about which of the planned experiments appear most exciting to the community . in section [ sec : nonacademic ] we present some of the opinions gathered by those who received their training within hep but have chosen to pursue careers outside of academia .",
    "finally in section [ sec : surveyquestions ] we present all the survey questions and include some of the direct responses we received from the many participants .",
    "the goal of the survey administered by the snowmass young physicists was to collect a broad range of opinions that reflect the physics interests , the career outlook , and the general mood of the field leading up to snowmass 2013 .",
    "the survey was administered using google forms @xcite and available from april 1st to july 15th 2013 ( http://tinyurl.com/snowmassyoung ) .",
    "this survey contains four distinct sections :    1 .   * demographic information : * this includes general information such as the gender , marital status , and citizenship but also information that is specific to the demographics of hep .",
    "this information includes current frontier of work , current position within academia ( e.g. graduate student , post - doctoral researcher , tenured faculty , etc ... ) , and number of years in your current position .",
    "similar information for those on a non - academic career path was also gathered .",
    "* career outlook : * this section asked the respondent questions pertaining to their feelings and outlook on their current career .",
    "questions included what type of jobs are most attractive to young scientists , what factors impact their decisions to pursue an academic career , as well as what various external factors ( family , availability of jobs , job location , etc ... ) that impact their career decisions .",
    "* physics outlook : * these questions focused on the science that is being planned during snowmass 2013 .",
    "for example , respondents were asked : what their outlook for funding of hep in the future is , which frontier will have the greatest impact in the next 10 years on hep , and to indicate which of the planned experiments ( given from a non - exhaustive list ) did the respondents have the highest priority for . 4 .",
    "* non - academic career paths : * finally , this section of the survey was dedicated to gathering information from those who had received their training within hep but have since left to pursue a career outside of academia .",
    "in this section we asked questions about how their time in hep prepared them for their current career .",
    "additionally we gathered information to see how their professional lives compare to those working within hep .",
    "the survey was structured such that respondents would only see certain questions based on information about their current employment .",
    "figure [ fig : surveyflowchart ] shows a summary of the flow chart for the survey .",
    "this allows us to look for similarities across the different career paths without exposing respondents to questions that had little relevance to them .",
    "in hindsight , it would have been helpful to do the same for tenured faculty and young people , since many questions asked about preparing for careers outside of hep , and had little relevance for those more senior members of our field . for the survey that is to be administered post - snowmass , http://tinyurl.com/post-snowmass ,",
    "this issue has been resolved .    ]",
    "the parsing of responses to the survey allowed us to identify correlations across different frontiers and different career stages . while many of the questions from the career outlook section focused on concerns most relevant to young scientists , most of the questions and answers included options that could be answered by all who were taking the survey .",
    "a small amount of data clean up was necessary before the sample could be analyzed .",
    "this was mostly to format answers to questions in such a way that they could be analyzed using c++ scripts .",
    "an example of one such clean up came from a question asking users to input the average number of hours worked in a week .",
    "many users inputted `` @xmath0 45 '' .",
    "this tilde was simply removed from the data before being outputted to c++ code .",
    "finally results of the survey were outputted to a series of root files which can be read by a simple analysis script .",
    "a complete survey response is seen as an `` event '' and this allows the end user to write a simple analysis script to apply selection , make histograms , and output the results . a complete package including the raw data , translated root files , and an example analysis script can be found here :    http://snowmassyoung.hep.net/syp2013_publicdata.tar.gz    the plots shown in this paper have negligible uncertainties and a full set of plots with uncertainties can be found here :    http://snowmassyoung.hep.net/plots.html",
    "demographic information composed an important part of the survey and included @xmath0 10 - 12 questions ( depending on if you were on the academic or non - academic path of the survey ) including information about gender , marital status , number of children , and current employment .",
    "a total of 1112 responses were collected for the syp 2013 survey , of which 956 fit the `` young '' definition , e.g. non - tenured inside academia , and 74 respondents coming from non - academic career paths . comparing this to the 2001 survey which collected 1508 responses , of which 857 fit the `` young '' definition",
