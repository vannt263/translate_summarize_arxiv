    "that gauge fields successfully describe the forces between elementary particles is certainly among the greatest discoveries in physics . but gauge theories are not restricted to high energy physics . in condensed matter physics one is often interested in theories with constraints . in a sense",
    "a constraint is just a ( infinitely strong ) force and it is quite natural that these theories also can be formulated as gauge theories .",
    "+   + the gauge field description is in terms of gauge _ potentials _ , which are redundant variables .",
    "the theory is therefore invariant with respect to a change of gauge .",
    "the most important consequence of this gauge symmetry is that it dictates the form of the interaction vertices between the gauge fields and the other fields in the theory .",
    "other than that ; the gauge - invariance is just a reminder that we are working with redundant variables .",
    "this redundancy can be very annoying , in particular when using path - integrals , and it is often necessary to choose a specific gauge .",
    "this choice of gauge _ can not _ affect any physical quantities calculated in the theory .",
    "+   + in this paper we will consider a theory of @xmath1 gauge bosons coupled to nonrelativistic fermions .",
    "this theory is motivated by the composite fermion approach to the half - filled landau level state in the quantum hall effect . +   +",
    "some years ago it was observed that the @xmath2 quantum hall state exhibits metal - like features @xcite .",
    "using the idea of jain @xcite , in which two flux quanta are `` attached '' to each electron ; making a composite fermion , halperin , lee and read @xcite formulated the theory of the @xmath2 state as a theory of composite fermions interacting with a fictitious gauge field , in _ zero _ external magnetic field . in the mean field approximation , in which the electrons are uniformly spread out , this theory is just that of free ( composite ) fermions .",
    "therefore , in the mean field approximation , the @xmath2 state is certainly metallic .",
    "striking evidence of the existence of a fermi surface was subsequently observed experimentally @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "+   + in order to make a consistent theory of the @xmath2 state it is necessary to also include the effects of gauge - fluctuations .",
    "however , when fluctuations of the gauge field are taken into account , it seems at first sight that the mean field picture is destroyed .",
    "as shown in @xcite the self - energy correction due to the transverse gauge fluctuations dominates over the linear in frequency fermi liquid term at low frequencies .",
    "+   + in an attempt to address the role of the gauge field fluctuations nayak and wilczek @xcite showed , using a renormalization - group approach , that for electron - electron interactions of shorter range than @xmath3 , the fluctuations lead to a strong coupling fixed point in the infra - red , different from the fermi liquid fixed point .",
    "their result was based on the calculation of the single - particle green function and gauge - invariance through the ward identity .",
    "a somewhat similar approach was taken by chakravarty _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "they studied the same system using the @xmath4-expansion around @xmath5 , and obtained essentially the same result ; a strong coupling fixed point .",
    "+   + stern and halperin @xcite constructed a boltzman transport equation for the @xmath2 state in the same way as landau did for the fermi liquid . this construction is based on the pole structure of the single - particle green function .",
    "+   + as emphasized in @xcite the single - particle green function is not gauge - invariant , and so any conclusions based on it might not be physical .",
    "this leads naturally to the question whether or not the existence of the strong coupling fixed point found in @xcite,@xcite , or the pole structure used in @xcite is dependent on the choice of gauge ?",
    "+   + we will in this paper show that although the single - particle green function is dependent on the choice of gauge , the @xmath0-function is not , i.e. neither the existence of the strong coupling fixed point found by nayak and wilczek nor the pole structure used by stern and halperin is dependent on the choice of gauge .",
    "the lagrangian density considered in this paper is @xmath6 this lagrangian is motivated by the composite fermion description of the @xmath2 quantum hall state , where two flux tubes are attached to each electron forming composite fermions . since the flux quanta are attached to the electrons , fluctuations in electron - density lead to fluctuations in the gauge field .",
    "this is taken care of by the third term in which the electron - electron interaction @xmath7 controls the gauge fluctuations . here",
    "we will consider electron - electron interactions of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is close to @xmath10 .",
    "the last term is the gauge - fixing term .",
    "it is obtained using the faddeev - popov ansatz to restrict @xmath11 to a gauge in which @xmath12 and then averaging over a gaussian distribution , with mean value @xmath13 and width @xmath14 , of such functions @xmath15 .",
    "coulomb gauge corresponds to @xmath16 .",
    "+   + in order to describe the @xmath2 state properly , a chern - simons term and a time - like gauge field ( @xmath17 ) should also be included .",
    "we omit these terms because it is likely , as for coulomb interaction in metals , that the @xmath17-field is screened and does not contribute to the fluctuations at low frequencies .",
    "there are however subtleties associated with the fluctuations of the @xmath17 field @xcite,@xcite which we do not address here .",
    "+   + before we go on to study the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) , let us understand why the @xmath0-function in qed is gauge - invariant .",
    "the qed - lagrangian density in terms of the bare coupling and fields is @xmath18 by redefining fields and the coupling constant @xmath19 the form of the interaction between the fermions and the gauge - field is dictated by gauge - invariance .",
    "so for gauge - invariance to hold in the renormalized theory : @xmath20 this identity can also be proven using the ward identity , which is nothing but the statement of gauge - invariance .",
    "now consider the correlation function @xmath21 this correlation function is obviously gauge - independent , and therefore @xmath22 should also be independent of gauge .",
    "this and the above ward identity ( [ ward ] ) ensures that the @xmath0-function which is obtained by differentiating @xmath23 is independent of the choice of gauge . +   + we see that neither @xmath24 nor @xmath25 play any role in this argument .",
    "let us think about computing the above correlation function ( [ corr ] )",
    ". the exact answer will of course be a very complicated function of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this answer should not change as we change the gauge , and so if @xmath25 and @xmath23 were dependent on gauge , amazing cancellations would have to occur .",
    "conceivably the only cancellations that can occur should be due to the ward identity .",
    "since the ward identity has nothing to do with @xmath25 it follows that @xmath25 can not be dependent on gauge either .",
    "@xmath24 is not constrained by the above as the correlation function ( [ corr ] ) can be calculated using the effective action for the gauge fields in which the fermions are integrated out .",
    "@xmath24 will be absorbed into the measure , and there is nothing preventing @xmath24 from being gauge - dependent .",
    "+   + for non - abelian gauge theories the situation is somewhat different from qed .",
    "there the gauge - field renormalization constant is dependent on gauge , but in spite of that , the @xmath0-function is gauge - independent there also .",
    "+   + let us now return to the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) .",
    "written in fourier space the euclidean action in terms of renormalized couplings and fields is @xmath28 we will assume a circular fermi surface and eventually take the zero- temperature limit such that @xmath29 .",
    "it is of course possible to linearize the energy dispersion around the fermi surface , in that case @xmath25 is naturally named @xmath30 .",
    "this linearization can not be essential for any important physics and will not be used in this paper .",
    "note that there is no renormalization constant associated with @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath31 measures the total number of particles which does not change .",
    "the renormalization of @xmath32 is taken care of by @xmath22 .",
    "+   + by simple dimensional analysis one can verify that the relevant coupling between the gauge field and the fermions is @xmath33 and not @xmath34 as in qed . therefore the relevant @xmath0-function for",
    "this problem does nt involve just @xmath35 , but @xmath35,@xmath25 and @xmath22 . as in qed",
    ", gauge invariance requires @xmath36 .",
    "this can be seen explicitly by writing down the ward identity .",
    "our lagrangian is not gauge - invariant with respect to gauge- transformations which mix space and time .",
    "we must therefore consider the spatial vertex separately in the ward identity , setting the external frequency to zero .",
    "as @xmath22 is obviously gauge - invariant , we need only to find if @xmath25 depends on the choice of gauge , to make statements about the @xmath0-function .",
    "+   + in the mean field approximation the gauge field vanishes .",
    "since the mean field theory describes a metal it is reasonable to proceed as in the theory of metals where one uses the rpa - corrected form of the interaction .",
    "the bare photon propagator extracted from the lagrangian is @xmath37 the rpa - approximation of the propagator is obtained by summing an infinite series of bubble diagrams .",
    "the polarization bubble is shown in figure 1 , and its expression is @xmath38 where @xmath39 and the bare single - particle propagator is @xmath40 summing the infinite series of bubble diagrams we obtain @xmath41 the transverse part is independent of the gauge - fixing parameter @xmath14 , and the longitudinal part of the gauge interaction does not include any information about the electron - electron interaction .",
    "+   + the calculations of @xmath42 and @xmath43 are straight - forward at @xmath44 . in the zero - temperature limit of the imaginary time formalism we get in @xmath45 , for @xmath46 and @xmath47 : @xmath48 having calculated the gauge boson propagator",
    "we can now calculate the self - energy diagrams .",
    "the one - loop diagrams contributing to the self - energy are drawn in figure 2 .",
    "the expression is @xmath49 for convenience we will split the contributions to the self - energy into two pieces , @xmath50 the first part is the self - energy obtained from the diagrams in figure 2 using the transverse part of the gauge propagator , while the second part is obtained using the longitudinal propagator in the same diagrams .",
    "it is obvious from the form of the gauge - propagator ( [ rpagauge ] ) that only @xmath51 will depend on gauge .",
    "let us first show that the logarithmic singularity necessary for the strong coupling fixed point is obtained by calculating @xmath52 . performing the angular integral in @xmath45 , the transverse contribution to the one - loop self - energy",
    "can be written @xmath53 .",

    "the self - energy takes the form @xmath57 .",
    "\\label{above}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the ellipses indicate higher order terms in the expansion of the square root .",
    "these terms are not as singular as the leading term , so they can safely be neglected .",
    "let us now expand the renormalization constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the coupling constant , @xmath58 using this expansion we have @xmath59 contributions to @xmath60 are distinguished by the fact that they renormalize @xmath61 differently from @xmath62 .",
    "so it is the second term in the above expression ( [ above ] ) which will contribute to @xmath60 .",
    "the second term is @xmath63 when @xmath64 the first term in the last parenthesis will give the leading behaviour .",
    "setting @xmath44 , @xmath65 , @xmath32 and using the result ( [ d2a ] ) for @xmath66 this leading behaviour is @xmath67 in the special case @xmath68 , corresponding to @xmath3-interactions between the fermions , we find in the low - frequency limit : @xmath69 in this case the correction to the @xmath70-behaviour is logarithmic , as observed by nayak and wilczek .",
    "this case is the marginal case which sets the borderline between the fermi liquid theory and a strong coupling theory .",
    "for @xmath71 , corresponding to interactions more long - range than coulomb interactions , the self - energy vanishes faster than @xmath72 and no deviations from fermi liquid are seen .",
    "but for @xmath73 , short - range electron - electron interactions , the self - energy becomes the dominant term at small @xmath72 and the system is not in the fermi liquid universality class .",
    "+   + the question is now whether these conclusions depend on the choice of gauge . at first sight",
    "they do not , since the transverse gauge - propagator does not depend on @xmath14 .",
    "however , one could imagine that the longitudinal gauge - propagator , which is dependent on @xmath14 , could give additional competing singularities .",
