    "the study of the structure and evolution of protoplanetary disks is currently an important area of astronomy as it can provide insights into both star and planet formation . in recent years",
    "there has been considerable debate about the final destination of disc material - do discs disperse through a mixture of accretion onto the star and internal consumption by conversion into planets , or are they instead dispersed by an extrinsic agent which can operate in competition with planet formation ?",
    "obviously , the answer to this question relates to the lifetime of circumstellar discs and the efficiency of planet formation around stars of various masses .    since disc dispersal by central wind stripping is not very efficient ( matsuyama , johnstone & hollenbach , 2009 ) and since encounters with passing stars is ineffective in all but the densest environments ( scally & clarke 2001 , pfalzner et al . , 2006 ) , and",
    "since likewise the effect of photoevaporation by neighbouring ob stars requires a very rich cluster environment ( johnstone et al . , 1998 ) , the most likely extrinsic agent of disc dispersal is via photoevaporation by energetic ( ultraviolet or x - ray ) radiation of the central star . indeed the detection of ne  ii emission in the spectra of e.g pascucci et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and herczeg et al .",
    "( 2007 ) is widely interpreted as evidence for disc irradiation by high energy photons and potentially accompanying photoevaporation .",
    "opinion is however currently divided as to whether this is best explained in terms of irradiation by x - rays ( e.g. glassgold 2007 , ercolano 2008b , meijerink 2008 ) or ionising ultraviolet ( euv ) radiation ( gorti & hollenbach 2008 , alexander 2008 ) .",
    "the x - ray properties of low mass pre - main sequence stars are well determined ( in contrast to the case for the euv radiation from these stars ) , with flux levels that are , if anything , somewhat higher in the case of weak line ( discless ) t - tauri stars than in their disc bearing ( classical t tauri star ) counterparts ( preibisch et al . , 2005 , feigelson et al . , 2007 ) : although this may result from absorption of some of the x - ray emission in accretion flows close to the star ( gregory et al . , 2007 ,",
    "but see also drake et al . ,",
    "2009 ) , it at least demonstrates that the x - rays remain strong throughout and after the disc bearing stage and are therefore , in principle , available for disc dispersal .",
    "the corresponding observational situation in the euv case is much less clear , given the lack of suitably high quality ultraviolet spectra , particularly in weak line t tauri stars ( alexander , clarke & pringle , 2005 ; kamp & sammar , 2004 ) .",
    "another potential drawback to euv photoevaporation is that , even if one has an accurate estimate of the euv output of the star , it does not necessarily follow that these photons can reach the disc , since photons near the lyman limit are particularly susceptible to absorption by even small columns of neutral material close to the star .",
    "this represents a possible counter - argument to ne  ii emission being excited by euv radiation in most cases .",
    "it is usually therefore argued ( e.g. gorti & hollenbach , 2009 ) that euv photoevaporation can not be effective until late times when the subsiding of both accretion and outflow activity should allow the disc to be exposed to ionising photons . from this point",
    "onwards , the theory is well developed ( hollenbach et al . , 1994 , clarke et al . , 2001 ,",
    "alexander et al . , 2006a , b ) , with a predicted photoevaporation rate of @xmath4 yr@xmath2 , for an euv luminosity of @xmath510@xmath6s@xmath2 ( the rate goes as the square root of the assumed luminosity ) , and the interplay between photoevaporation and accretion producing a characteristic evolutionary sequence involving the creation and rapid outward expansion of an inner disc hole .",
    "thus euv photoevaporation provides an alternative to planet formation as the origin of inner hole ( transition disc ) systems ( see e.g. najita et al . , 2007 ) .    notwithstanding this success of euv photoevaporation at late times in removing the last few jupiter masses of gas from the disc",
    ", there has also been some discussion of whether other radiation sources , such as x - rays or non - ionising ( fuv ) ultraviolet photons , might not be much more effective disc photoevaporation agents at early times and might indeed be capable of removing much larger quantities of disc gas .",
    "gorti & hollenbach ( 2009 ) investigated this issue and argued that fuv photoevaporation is indeed a very significant effect at early times when accretion produces a strong fuv flux : their predicted fuv mass loss rates of @xmath7 yr@xmath2 exceed euv rates by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "they however concluded , by contrast , that x - rays , in the absence of fuv radiation , are considerably less important even than the euv , a conclusion also shared by alexander et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "another recent study of x - ray photoevaporation was provided by ercolano et al 2008b , henceforth paper  i. while paper  i mainly aimed at understanding the thermochemical structure of the irradiated regions of the disk and at identifying gas - phase emission line diagnostics ( see also ercolano , drake & clarke 2008c ) , it also yielded an estimate for the x - ray photoevaporation rate that was considerably higher than those found by gorti & hollenbach ( 2009 ) and alexander et al ( 2004 ) , being around @xmath8 yr@xmath2 .",
    "this estimate was however very preliminary , due not only to the general difficulty of estimating mass loss rates from static models ( see section 6 ) , but on account of the fact that the disc s density structure was not modified in response to heating of its upper layers .",
    "instead it was assumed that the disc adopted the fixed structure that it would have in the case that its temperature structure was controlled by full thermal coupling between dust and gas ( dalessio et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "this is clearly inconsistent given that the gas and dust temperatures in the x - ray irradiated disc turn out to be completely decoupled down to a column depth of @xmath55@xmath910@xmath10@xmath11 .",
    "in contrast , gorti & hollenbach ( 2009 ) and alexander et al .",
    "( 2004 ) both iterated to a self - consistent hydrostatic density structure for the irradiated disc .",
    "since these authors had previously concluded that x - ray photoevaporation is a minor effect , it would appear necessary to check how a similar iteration onto a hydrostatic structure would affect the initial estimate of paper  i. the reason for pursuing a study that is broadly similar to those of gorti & hollenbach ( 2009 ) and alexander et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , is that there are a number of differences in the way that the radiative transfer is treated in the three works .",
    "we employ a fully three dimensional monte carlo approach to the radiative transfer through dust and gas , and , while - in the present paper - we iterate on the density profile at each cylindrical radius , the final radiation field and temperature structure represents the thermal equilibrium condition for a given density field , without any simplifying assumptions about the geometry of the resulting radiative flux vectors .",
    "the other two works instead employ methods that are pseudo - one dimensional in that they integrate along a range of lines of sight from the x - ray source .",
    "there are also some other differences concerning the assumed spectrum of the x - ray source and some details about the detailed interaction between x - rays and gas that are discussed in more detail in section 5 .",
    "the calculations presented here thus aim specifically at providing an improved estimate of x - ray photoevaporation rates , together with a comparison with the results of using irradiating spectra that also include an euv component . for computational tractability , only the inner 50au of the disk , from which significant photoevaporation is found ,",
    "are considered here and therefore a full emission line spectrum is not available .",
    "this will be investigated in future work .",
    "a description of the computational methods is given in section  2 .",
    "our improved photoevaporation rates are presented and discussed in section  3 , while section  4 describes the resulting thermal and ionisation structures .",
    "section  5 analyses differences in methods and results compared with previous studies and section  6 sets out the main uncertainties involved in estimating mass loss rates from hydrostatic models .",
    "section  7 summarises our main results .",
    "we have used a modified version of the 3d photoionisation and dust radiative transfer code mocassin ( ercolano et al . , 2003 ; 2005 ; 2008a ) .",
    "this code uses a monte carlo approach to the three - dimensional transfer of radiation , allowing for the self - consistent transfer of both the stellar ( primary ) and diffuse ( secondary ) components of the radiation field .",
    "details of atomic data and physical processes used for the photoionisation calculations are given by ercolano et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2008a ) and ercolano & storey ( 2006 ) .",
    "the main changes to the thermal balance and dimensional setup of the code have been described in detail in paper  i and are briefly summarised here .",
    "( i ) a treatment of viscous heating is included using the formulation for a thin disk by pringle ( 1981 ) .",
    "( ii ) gas cooling by collisions of grains with a mixture of atomic and molecular hydrogen is calculated using the method of hollenbach & mckee ( 1979 ) , also discussed by glassgold et al .",
    "( iii ) mocassin was adapted to allow for two dimensional simulations in order to exploit the symmetry of the system .    in paper",
    "i , viscous accretion heating was included using the standard treatment for a thin disk ( pringle 1981 ) with viscosity parameter @xmath12  = 0.01 .",
    "this corresponds to an accretion rate of the order of 10@xmath13 .",
    "this is rather high , in particular as we are interested in the effects of x - ray photoevaporation in later stages of disk evolution when accretion has turned off .",
    "this is achieved in our models by setting @xmath12  = 10@xmath14 which effectively renders accretion heating negligible .",
    "we have also improved the model in paper  i by including excitation of c  i and o  i fine structure lines by collisions with neutral hydrogen ( only collisions with electrons were previously included , see ercolano , drake & clarke , 2008 for more details ) .",
    "we have further modified the mocassin code to include a self - consistent calculation of the 1d vertical hydrostatic equilibrium structure ( hse ) of the x - ray heated disk .",
    "we used the methods described by alexander , clarke and pringle ( 2004 , acp04 ) to update the disk density structure after convergence of the thermal and ionisation structure based on the previous hse iteration .",
    "our initial density distribution is the same as that used in paper  i and it consists of the disk model structure calculated by dalessio et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , selected to be that which best fits the median sed of t  tauri stars in taurus ( dalessio , 2003 ) .",
    "this model was calculated under the assumption of full thermal coupling between dust and gas and featured an irradiating star of mass 0.7  m@xmath15 , radius 2.5  r@xmath15 , and an effective temperature of 4000  k. disk parameters include a mass accretion rate of 10@xmath16 m@xmath15 yr@xmath2 and a viscosity parameter @xmath12  =  0.01 .",
    "the total mass of the disk is 0.027  m@xmath15 and the outer radius of @xmath5500  au .",
    "the surface density in the disk is inversely proportional to the cylindrical radius .",
    "we perform hse calculations in the vertical direction , using as a lower boundary the point on the z - axis where the gas and dust temperatures become decoupled . as in paper",
    "i , we keep the dust temperatures fixed to the values calculated by dalessio et al .",
    "( 2001 ) given that without treating the stellar or interstellar optical and far - uv fields , the dust temperatures we would obtain from our model would be incorrect . calculating the hydrostatic equilibrium from the decoupling point",
    "has the advantage of keeping a realistic density structure below this point even when only x - ray irradiation is considered ( i.e. not treating the photospheric emission of the pre - main sequence star ) .",
    "the density structure from the lower boundary point is calculated using a slightly modified version of equation  a9 of acp04 , as shown below . at a given cylindrical radius ,",
    "the number density of the gas as a function of height above the midplane , @xmath17 , is given by    @xmath18\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are density and temperature at the lower boundary , @xmath21 is the mass of the star , @xmath22 is the gravitational constant , @xmath23 is the mass of the hydrogen atom and @xmath24 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "@xmath25 is calculated as follows    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the mean molecular weight of the gas at @xmath17 and @xmath28 is the cylindrical radius .",
    "equations  [ eq : hydro2 ] and [ eq : hydro ] differ from equation  a9 of acp04 in that we do not assume z @xmath29 r. we note , however , that a full treatment would consist of a two - dimensional hse in the radial and vertical directions  with gravity balanced by pressure in the vertical direction and with gravity balanced by a combination of pressure and centrifugal forces in the radial directions . in the case of an irradiated disk with significant vertical extent",
    "the pressure terms are very complicated and a full solution is not attempted in this paper .",
    "it is indeed unclear whether a fully two - dimensional hydrostatic solution would improve our calculations , particularly in the upper layers of the disk , where the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium is altogether poor given that material is likely to be flowing in a photoevaporative wind .",
    "however a full hydrodynamical flow solution is beyond the scope of this paper .      although we do not calculate the dust temperatures , the effects of gas - dust interactions on the temperature structure of the gas , are still taken into account in our gas thermal balance as well as in the radiative transfer , where the competition between dust and gas for the absorption of radiation is properly treated ( see ercolano et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "our dust treatment consists of a standard mrn - type model ( mathis , rumpl & nordsiek , 1977 ) with minimum and maximum grain radii @xmath30 m and @xmath31 .",
    "the disk structure of dalessio et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , which provides our starting density distribution , employs a bimodal dust distribution , where atmospheric dust follows the standard mrn model and interior dust consists of larger grains with a size distribution still described by a power law of index of @xmath32 , but with @xmath30 m and @xmath33 .",
    "the transition between atmospheric and interior dust occurs at an height of 0.1 times the midplane gas scale height .",
    "as we are mainly interested in regions well above the transition point , we have chosen for simplicity to use atmospheric dust everywhere .",
    "following dalessio et al .",
    "( 2001 ) the dust to gas mass ratio of graphite is 0.00025 and that of silicates is 0.0004 .",
    "high energy dust absorption and scattering coefficients are calculated from the dielectric constants for graphite and silicates of laor & draine ( 1993 ) , which extend to the x - ray domain .",
    "spherical grains are assumed and we use the standard mie scattering series expansion for complex refractive indices , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the scattering parameter ( see laor & draine , 1993 ) . for @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    "we use rayleigh - gans theory ( bohren & huffman , 1983 ) , and for @xmath36 and @xmath38 we use the treatment specified by laor & draine ( 1993 ) , which is based on geometric optics .",
    "we illuminate the disk using synthetic x - ray spectra representative of the high - energy emission from a typical t tauri star corona .",
    "this coronal x - ray emission arises from a collision - dominated optically - thin plasma .",
    "we first assumed a single x - ray temperature , @xmath39 , and a number of luminosities spanning 2 orders of magnitudes around our base luminosity of @xmath40(0.1 - 10  kev)@xmath41  erg / sec ( model xs0h10lx1 ) .",
    "the labelling scheme of our models is explained in section  2.4 .",
    "the bulk of the luminosity in these models is emitted in the 1 - 2  kev region as shown in figure  [ f : sp1 ] . the same unabsorbed isothermal model spectrum for log(t@xmath42 ) = 7.2 was also used in paper  i and we refer to that work for a more detailed description of the computational methods and atomic data used .",
    "while such a model provides an accurate description of the x - ray spectrum , it represents only a lower limit to the unabsorbed flux at euv wavelengths ( @xmath43   ) where cooler plasma can contribute significant flux . in paper",
    "i we argued that for most of a disk s lifetime euv photons would not easily reach the disk due to absorption from circumstellar material and restricted our investigation to the x - ray dominated irradiation spectrum above .",
    "here we expand our study to explore the effects that different amounts of euv irradiation would have on a disk that is also simultaneously irradiated by x - ray . in a companion paper ( glassgold et al .",
    ", 2009 in prep . )",
    "we study the relative importance of euv and x - rays on ionisation and heating rates , while here we focus on their effects on photoevaporation . to this aim",
    ", we employ a more sophisticated multi - temperature plasma model developed to provide an accurate representation of the ionizing coronal spectrum throughout the euv - x - ray range . we have not included any contributions to the ionizing flux from accretion here ; this will be considered in future work .    observed line - of - sight absorbing columns toward t  tauri stars are typically greater than @xmath44 atoms @xmath11 ( e.g. feigelson & montmerle 1999 ) , and consequently their euv spectra are completely obscured from our view by photoelectric absorption . while this would appear to be a rather serious impediment to producing a realistic t  tauri euv spectrum , there are much more nearby and relatively unabsorbed sources that provide a template : the rs  cvn class of active binaries that comprise at least one evolved star lying on the sub - giant or giant branch .",
    "the coronal emission of rs  cvn binaries is largely dominated by the evolved component that is likely to be magnetically more similar to a t  tauri star than are active main - sequence stars with shallower convection zones .",
    "rotation periods of rs  cvn binaries are also similar to those of t  tauri stars and typically lie in the range 1 - 10 days ( e.g. , strassmeier et al .",
    "1993 , getman et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "the expected resemblance of the coronal properties of rs  cvn - type binaries and t  tauri stars is borne out in x - ray studies .",
    "for example , the _ einstein _",
    "survey of late - type stars by schmitt et al .",

    "these ranges are very similar to those found for t  tauri stars of the orion nebular cluster ( onc ) in the mass range 1 - 2@xmath48 by preibisch et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . on this basis",
    ", the use of rs  cvn euv spectra as a proxy for the coronal spectra of t  tauri stars seems well - justified .",

    "they derived emission measure distributions as a function of temperature for the range @xmath497.2 and we use a representation of these for the emission measure distribution adopted as the basis of our t  tauri model .",

    "this is made necessary particularly by the fact that the hse models are likely to overestimate the densities in the upper layers ( which would be in reality part of a photoevaporative flow ) , hence fixed density structure models , which underestimate the density of the upper layers , can be used to provide an educated guess of the uncertainties in the results .",

    "this can be understood by examining the surface mass loss rates , @xmath75 , and total mass loss rates , m , of models with different pre - screening columns , as shown for the hydrostatic equilibrium models in figure  [ f : sigmah ] . although @xmath75 at 5 - 10au decreases as the pre - screening column increases ( see left panel of figure  [ f : sigmah ] ) , however @xmath75 at larger radii ( 20 - 30 au ) is roughly invariant for columns up to 10@xmath78 .",

    "the reason why @xmath75 at radii in the 20 - 30 au range appears to be roughly the same for models with obscuring columns up to @xmath81 ( which screen out euv radiation ) is that the thermal structure of the disk at this radial distance is hardly affected by euv radiation which is very weak at these radii due to large neutral h opacity of the disk at euv wavelengths .",
    "radiation at soft x - ray wavelengths , on the other hand , is optimal for heating this region of the disk .    for columns larger than 10@xmath78",

    "this is due to the fact that these high pre - screening column models , while having the same total x - ray luminosity as less screened ones , have a much harder spectrum ( see figure  [ f : jspectra ] , but note that for clarity the spectra shown in this figure have not been normalised ) .",

    "we note at this point that previous work by gorti & hollenbach ( 2009 , gh09 ) , who used a rather hard x - ray spectrum to irradiate their disks also obtained very low photoevaporation rates ( see discussion in section  [ s : comp ] ) .",

    "this temperature behaviour is expected for a photoionised gas whose thermal balance in this region is dominated by heating by photoionisation and cooling by collisionally excited line emission . the density behaviour is due to the fact that at high z s , where gravity is weak , the exponential term in equation  1 tends to unity and therefore the density at given height is then only proportional to the ratio of the gas temperature at the lower boundary point to the local gas temperature , i.e. the hydrostatic structure is roughly isobaric .",

    "therefore , while we agree with the numerical results of acp04 , we interpret the result differently and stress that our calculations ( and those of acp04 ) both suggest that x - ray photoevaporation does play a significant role in disk dispersal .",

    "( 2007 ) and paper  i both used a fixed density structure for their calculations , and the higher photoevaporation rates are due to the fact that no obstruction by the puffed - up inner disk is accounted for in these models .    contrary to this work and to the results mentioned above , recent work by gorti & hollenbach ( 2009 , gh09 ) predicts much smaller photoevaporation rates due to direct x - ray heating and concludes that x - rays are only of indirect importance for the dispersal of protoplanetary disks around solar mass stars .",
    "instead , their models predict that x - ray ionization generally acts to `` amplify '' fuv photoevaporation rates .",
    "while the authors state that their results are in agreement with those of acp04 , inspection of their figure  5 ( curve labeled @xmath100 ) shows that for their `` x - ray only '' model they estimate @xmath75 of the order of 10@xmath101 at 20  au , which is two orders of magnitude smaller than our and acp04 s estimates .",
    "we also note that acp04 obtained their estimate of @xmath102 at a radius of 19.1  au , rather than 10  au as stated in the gh09 paper .",
    "comparison of complicated theoretical calculations can be difficult and the reason for disagreement may be buried in the codes themselves or in the physical assumptions adopted .",
    "however we have identified at least one reason for the discrepancy between our calculations and those of gh09 which is the hardness of the illuminating x - ray spectrum .",
    "indeed , we find that the soft - x - ray region is the most efficient at heating the gas in the photoevaporation layer .",
    "gh09 use a rather hard spectrum , which peaks at 2kev and is approximated by a power - law with dl@xmath42/de @xmath5 e for @xmath103 kev and dl@xmath104/de @xmath5 e@xmath105 for @xmath106 kev .",
    "this is a significantly harder spectrum than that used by acp04 ( which peaked at 0.7kev ) , ourselves in paper  i ( see figure  [ f : sp1 ] ) and by glassgold et al .",
    "( 2007 , which peaked at 1kev ) . in this work we found",
    "that models irradiated by a hard spectrum such as that produced by high column screens ( e.g. fs22 models ) did not yield significant photoevaporation .",
    "we have run a model using the gh09 spectrum and we obtained @xmath107 at 20  au ( using the @xmath87 approximation ) and a total mass loss rate of @xmath510@xmath108 . while a step in the right direction , the hardness of the illuminating spectrum alone does not seem to be sufficient to explain the discrepancy and other factors must also come into play .",
    "by far the biggest uncertainties concern our attempt to use these hydrostatic radiative equilibrium models to estimate the resulting mass loss rates .",
    "this now becomes a critical problem given that our preliminary estimates suggest that , contrary to previous claims ( acp04 , gh09 ) , x - ray photoevaporation _ may _ be the major agent of disc dispersal .",
    "the uncertainties stem from the fact that we have derived the modified disc structure under the assumption of hse , and although this probably gives a reasonable description of the density structure at small z , it is obviously the case that a _",
    "static _ description does not produce a corresponding mass _ flow _ rate .",
    "instead , we have employed the simple approach of deriving the hydrostatic structure and then , at the height where the disc material exceeds the local escape temperature , assume free sonic outflow from that point .",
    "a similar approach in the euv case is less questionable for two reasons : i ) the steep temperature discontinuity at the ionisation front and the near isothermal conditions above it means that the location of the launch surface is independent of detailed modeling and just depends on the regions of the disc where photoionised gas is unbound and ii ) the density at the launch surface depends only on conditions above the ionisation front and not on the structure of the underlying disc .",
    "thus the fact that the disc below the launch surface is not strictly static has no effect on the resulting outflow rates .",
    "in the x - ray case , the temperature rises much more gradually with height : for example , for our model at 20 au , the temperature rises from roughly @xmath109 to @xmath110 k over a region about 6.5 au in height , over which the density of the hydrostatic structure falls by one order of magnitude . in reality",
    ", pressure gradients will cause the flow to be initiated below our nominal launch point , i.e. at a height where its temperature is less than the escape speed , and the density structure will be progressively modified over the region where the flow is accelerated .",
    "it therefore becomes little more than an exercise in educated guesswork to assign a point for estimating the escaping mass flux - the lower down in the structure one tries to do this , the more reliably the density structure will be known , but the less easy it is to assign a flow speed . at greater heights , it s easier to assign a flow speed ( unbound gas expands at about the sound speed ) , but the estimate of local density becomes unreliable , as the underlying density structure is now considerably modified by the flow .",
    "it is tempting ( see e.g. gh09 ) to propose a simple , physically motivated prescription that maps the structure of the photo - heated region onto an analytic flow solution at large radius ( for example , the isothermal parker wind solution ) .",
    "the problem with this is that although at large radii the flow will indeed approximate a quasi - spherical radial outflow , the transition between the nearly hydrostatic structure at the base and the parker - like structure at large radius is quite different from a parker wind - in particular , when the flow is non - radial , the interplay between terms in the momentum equation involving the divergence of the velocity , the gravitational acceleration and the centrifugal acceleration is quite different from the non - rotating parker case .",
    "the problem boils down to the fact that , until one knows the topology of the streamlines , one can not compute the variation of quantities along the streamlines - but that the steady state topology of the streamlines itself depends on the variation of quantities along the streamlines : in other words , it is a truly two dimensional problem .",
    "( see begelman et al .",
    ", 1983 for an attempt to parameterise the problem in terms of an ad hoc variation of the divergence of the velocity along streamlines ) . our initial hydrodynamic investigations of this problem ( alexander & clarke in prep .",
    ") demonstrate that the streamline topology and the mapping between base density and mass flux is very dependent on how the base density varies with radius in the disc .",
    "we therefore think that it is presently unwarranted to try and go beyond the simple estimates employed here and that further progress in estimating photoevaporation rates will require a combined hydrodynamics / radiative transfer approach .",
    "a further shortcoming is that a molecular chemistry network is still not included in our calculations .",
    "this poses a limitation on the accuracy of our gas temperature calculations in the lower layers where cooling by h@xmath111 and co rovibrational and rotational lines may become important .",
    "for example at a radial distance of 1  au and column densities of 10@xmath10 - 10@xmath61  @xmath11 glassgold et al .",
    "( 2004 ) find that co rovibrational lines dominate disk cooling .",
    "co rotational lines were also found to contribute somewhat to the cooling at greater depths , although in these regions the thermal balance is dominated by dust - gas collisions ( gni04 ) .",
    "we are currently in the process of developing a chemical network to be included in future studies and will therefore be able to derive a more accurate thermal / hydrostatic structure at low temperatures ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "it is questionable , however , how much such improvements will affect our estimates of photoevaporation rates , given that gas in this temperature range is strongly bound at radii less than 100 au .",
    "our calculations of the structure of x - ray irradiated discs in low mass pre - main sequence stars imply total photoevaporation rates that , taken at face value , exceed the photoevaporation rates produced by extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) radiation by an order of magnitude .",
    "this difference is attributable to the fact that a much more extended region of the disc is subject to x - ray photoevaporation than in the euv case ( i.e. significant evaporation out to @xmath113 au , in contrast to the euv case where little mass is lost beyond @xmath114 au ) .",
    "the reason for this different photoevaporation profile is that the x - rays are able to penetrate columns of up to @xmath115@xmath11 through the disc s puffed up , x - ray irradiated atmosphere and thus still produce significant mass flows when they impact the disc at several tens of au . in the euv case , by contrast ,",
    "the regions of the disc from which the flow can be launched are shielded from _",
    "irradiation by stellar photons and are instead subject only to recombination photons from the bound region of the disc s ionised atmosphere . since gas at @xmath116k is only bound out to @xmath117 au , most of the euv induced mass loss is restricted to regions modestly greater than this ( hollenbach et al . , 1994 , richling & yorke , 2000 ;",
    "font et al , 2004 ) .",
    "our conclusion that x - ray photoevaporation is more important than euv photoevaporation is only strengthened when one considers two additional factors : i ) the possibility of further attenuation of the euv flux by absorption by any neutral flows ( such as winds ) close to the star and ii ) the fact that we have unambiguous evidence that young stars remain strong x - ray sources even after disc dispersal and thus are clearly available as a potential disc dispersal mechanism .    however , we emphasise that our estimates of x - ray photoevaporation rates are _ much _ more uncertain than the euv values , notwithstanding our careful treatment of two - dimensional radiative transfer and our derivation of the puffed up density structure of the irradiated disc ( see discussion in section 6 ) .",
    "these uncertainties were of academic interest as long as it seemed likely that x - ray photoevaporation was in any case a minor agent for disc dispersal .",
