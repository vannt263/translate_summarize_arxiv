    "<S> the mixing properties ( or sensitivity to initial conditions ) of two - dimensional henon map have been explored numerically at the edge of chaos . </S>",
    "<S> three independent methods , which have been developed and used so far for the one - dimensional maps , have been used to accomplish this task . </S>",
    "<S> these methods are ( i )  measure of the divergence of initially nearby orbits , ( ii )  analysis of the multifractal spectrum and ( iii )  computation of nonextensive entropy increase rates </S>",
    "<S> . the obtained results strongly agree with those of the one - dimensional cases and constitute the first verification of this scenario in two - dimensional maps . </S>",
    "<S> this obviously makes the idea of weak chaos even more robust . </S>",
    "<S> + _ </S>",
    "<S> pacs number(s ) : 05.45.-a , 05.20.-y , 05.70.ce_    nowadays a growing number of works addressing one - dimensional dissipative maps signals out the increasing interest in exploring the behaviour of nonlinear dynamical systems at the edge of chaos@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this interest mostly stems from the fact that the standard theory considers this special point ( and also all other points where the standard lyapunov exponent vanishes ) as _ marginal _ and works addressing directly these marginal points are less than the works on the other regions of the system . </S>",
    "<S> recent works addressing the behaviour of dynamical systems at these points are based on the conjecture that the divergence of initially nearby trajectories , characterized by the sensitivity function    ( t)=_x(0)0 ( where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the discrepancies of the initial conditions at times 0 and @xmath2 ) , are not of the exponential type at these marginal points , but rather , of the power - law type like @xcite    ( t)= ^1/(1-q ) ( q ) , which comes from the conjecture that the controlling equation becomes @xmath3 ( instead of the usual one @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result recovers the standard one in the @xmath5 limit and also defines a generalized version of the lyapunov exponent @xmath6 , which inversely scales with time , but now within a power - law . within this unified scheme , apart from the standard regimes where we have chaos , sensitivity and insensitivity to the initial conditions , we have also weak insensitivity to the initial conditions for @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and weak sensitivity to the initial conditions for @xmath10 , @xmath8 , @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the last case characterizes also the most interesting marginal point , the chaos threshold . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of asymptotic power - law sensitivity to the initial conditions has already been observed since long@xcite , but eq.(2 ) provides a more complete description than that , since it is expected to be valid not only at very large times but also at intermediate times as well ( of course after a short transient ) . </S>",
    "<S> this equation in fact corresponds to the power - law growth of the upper bounds of a complex time dependence of the sensitivity function , which includes considerable and ever lasting fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> these upper bounds ( @xmath12 ) allow us to determine the proper value of the @xmath13 index ( say @xmath14 ) for the dynamical system under consideration . </S>",
    "<S> this constitutes the first method of finding the @xmath14 value of a given dynamical system .    </S>",
    "<S> the second method for the same purpose is based on the geometrical aspects of the critical attractor of the system at the edge of chaos . due to the complexity of critical dynamical attractor </S>",
    "<S> , a multifractal formalism is needed in order to reveal its complete scaling behaviour . in this formalism </S>",
    "<S> , each moment of the probability distribution has a contribution coming from a particular subset of points of the attractor with fractal dimension @xmath15 . using a partition containing @xmath16 boxes , the content on each contributing box scales as @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the multifractal measure is then characterized by the continuous function @xmath18 which reflects the fractal dimension of the subset with singularity strength @xmath19@xcite . using the scaling behaviour of the multifractal singularity spectrum @xmath18 , </S>",
    "<S> a new scaling relation has been proposed @xcite as    = - ( q^ * < 1 ) where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the vanishing points of downward parabolalike concave curve @xmath18 and characterize the scaling behaviour of the most concentrated and most rarefied regions on the attractor . </S>",
    "<S> this fascinating relation , which connects the power - law sensitivity of dynamical systems with purely geometrical quantities , establishes another independent method for estimating the @xmath14 value of a dynamical system under study .    finally , the third method of accomplishing the same task , deals with the entropy increase rates @xcite . for large classes of dynamical systems , </S>",
    "<S> the rate of information loss in time is characterized by the kolmogorov - sinai ( ks ) entropy @xmath22 , which is defined as the increase , per unit time , of the standard boltzmann - gibbs entropy @xmath23 , namely    k_1_t_w _ n where @xmath2 is the time , @xmath24 is the number of regions in the partition of the phase space , @xmath25 is the number of initial conditions ( all chosen at @xmath26 within one region among the @xmath24 available ones ) that are evolving in time . </S>",
    "<S> although the ks entropy is defined , in principle , in terms of a single trajectory in phase space , it appears that , in almost all cases , it is possible to replace it by one based on an ensemble of initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the third method basically depends on the ensemble version of generalized ks entropy @xmath27 , which has been introduced as the increase of a proper nonextensive entropic form , namely ,    k_q_t_w _ n where @xmath28 is the tsallis entropy defined as @xcite    s_q(t)= where @xmath24 is total number of configurations and @xmath29 are the associated probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that , consistently , the well - known pesin equality is also expected to be generalizable as @xmath30 if @xmath31 and @xmath32 otherwise . within this scheme </S>",
    "<S> , it is conjectured that ( i )  a special @xmath14 value exists such that @xmath27 is finite for @xmath33 , vanishes for @xmath34 and diverges for @xmath35 ; ( ii )  this special @xmath14 value coincides with that coming from the two other distinct methods explained above . </S>",
    "<S> this also connects @xmath14 values with the entropic index @xmath13 of the tsallis entropy as mentioned in @xcite . at this point , it is worthwhile to clarify a subtlety related to the generalized pesin equality : in fact , the @xmath13-generalized pesin equality implies two things . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the values of @xmath13 determined through the entropy rates are the same as those measured through other two distinct methods ; secondly , the slopes of the entropy rates are the same as the generalized lyapunov exponents of the sensitivity to the initial conditions . throughout the present paper , we address and verify only the first point , not the second .    </S>",
    "<S> these three independent methods of obtaining @xmath14 values have already been tested and verified with numerical calculations for a variety of one - dimensional dissipative ( symmetric and asymmetric ) map families @xcite , which strongly supports the idea that all these methods yield one and the same proper @xmath14 value of a given map . on the other hand , up to now ( to the best of our knowledge ) , there exist no attempt of testing these three methods in more general grounds like ( i )  two-(or more ) dimensional dissipative maps , ( ii )  conservative maps , ( iii )  high dimensional dissipative and conservative systems . in this study , our aim is to analyze a two - dimensional dissipative map within these lines for the first time , which hopefully constitutes an important step forward as , we believe , it would presumably stimulate new efforts addressing the other general cases given above .    </S>",
    "<S> the two - dimensional map that we focus on here is the henon map @xcite    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are map parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this map reduces to the standard logistic map when @xmath39 , whereas it becomes conservative when @xmath40 , in between these two cases , it is a two - dimensional dissipative map . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we focus on small values of the @xmath38 parameter such as @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , etc since , for greater values of @xmath38 , the numerical procedures used in the first and second methods do not allow us to analyze the map properly due to the increasing complexity of the system . to calculate the largest lyapunov exponent of the system , among the numerical procedures like benettin </S>",
    "<S> et al @xcite or froyland @xcite algorithms , we use the procedure given in @xcite .    before introducing our numerical findings of the three methods discussed above , </S>",
    "<S> let us recall our expectations </S>",
    "<S> . since the henon map , for all @xmath38 values , belongs to the same universality class of the logistic map ( namely , it has the same feigenbaum numbers and box counting fractal dimension at the edge of chaos with the logistic map , irrespective of the @xmath38 values , although the chaos threshold value @xmath44 monotonically decreases for increasing @xmath38 values ) , the natural expectation is to find a @xmath14 value for the henon map that coincides with the value of the logistic case ( @xmath45 ) for all @xmath38 values . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the verification of these three methods ( employed so far to study only one - dimensional maps ) in higher dimensional maps is quite valuable , it is better to use a test system with well known critical behaviour such as the henon map . within this reasoning </S>",
    "<S> , the present work will hopefully bring relevant information about the proper procedure to be used in investigating other high dimensional systems belonging to distinct universality classes . </S>",
    "<S> + * first method - *   using the numerical procedure given in @xcite for the calculation of the lyapunov exponent , one can determine the time evolution of the sensitivity function . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure is the following : using the derivative of the henon map @xmath46 , one can compute how an infinitesimally small error in a point ( @xmath47 ) of the attractor is transformed by one iteration . </S>",
    "<S> for any arbitrary direction ( @xmath48 ) of the error , one can compute the transformed error using the equation    @xmath49    therefore the error amplification is measured by the factor @xmath50^{1/2}$ ] . by iteration and renormalizing this procedure </S>",
    "<S> one can obtain the largest lyapunov exponent . as it is seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 , it exhibits a power - law divergence ( @xmath51 ) at the edge of chaos and the upper bound slope of this fractal structure allows us to calculate the @xmath14 value . </S>",
    "<S> for the ( @xmath52 ) pairs , we use the numerically determined extremum values of @xmath53 and its corresponding @xmath54 values for each @xmath38 parameter . </S>",
    "<S> for example , @xmath55 for @xmath39 ( logistic case ) , @xmath56 for @xmath41 and @xmath57 for @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the values of critical @xmath37 parameter calculated at the edge of chaos for some @xmath38 values are the following : @xmath59 for @xmath39 , @xmath60 for @xmath58 and @xmath61 for @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> from the analysis of fig .  1 , although the fractal structure and the slope seem to deteriorate with increasing values of @xmath38 , this does not prevent us to conclude that the proper @xmath14 value of the henon map , for all @xmath38 values , is @xmath45 since it is clearly seen that the fractal structure and the slope coincide with the logistic case ( @xmath39 ) for smaller time steps ( in logarithmic scale ) as @xmath38 values increase , whereas they start to deteriorate for larger time step . </S>",
    "<S> as the values of @xmath38 increase , the beginning of this deterioration shifts to smaller time steps . </S>",
    "<S> this originates from the fact that one needs @xmath44 values with greater precision ( in our calculations we have 10 - 11 digit precision ) as @xmath38 values increase , since the map becomes to be more complex . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , this effect is the same as the one that we can face with even for the logistic map if lower precision is used for @xmath44 value ( for example , instead of 10 - 11 digit precision if one uses 6 - 7 digits for @xmath44 , then a similar type of deterioration in the fractal structure is seen for smaller time steps for the logistic case as well ) . </S>",
    "<S> this point will become more transparent below when we discuss the second method in obtaining the proper @xmath14 value of the henon map . </S>",
    "<S> + * second method - *   now we turn our attention to the multifractal singularity spectrum @xmath18 of the critical attractor . </S>",
    "<S> if we can construct the @xmath18 curve for the henon map , then it is evident from the scaling relation ( 3 ) that , using the end points of the spectrum , we can determine the proper @xmath14 value of this map . </S>",
    "<S> constructing the @xmath18 curve , we use the well - known procedure of halsey et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , however it is suitable here to mention that other algorithms such as cvitanovic et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite can also be used for this purpose . before giving our results for the henon map , we believe , it is better to reexamine the logistic map within this method in order to clarify the effect of precision of @xmath44 values . to illustrate this point , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2a we give three different cases for the logistic map . </S>",
    "<S> it is clearly seen that the @xmath18 curve obtained using high precision for @xmath44 ( circle ) does not coincide with the one obtained using less precision for @xmath44 ( dotted line ) for the same number of iterations ( @xmath62 ) . on the other hand , we realize that it is possible to obtain the correct curve with less precision in @xmath44 if smaller values of iteration numbers are used ( @xmath63 ) as it is evident from the fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2a ( full line ) . </S>",
    "<S> the same kind of behaviour for the @xmath18 curve has been observed for the henon map as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2b . analyzing the results given in this figure </S>",
    "<S> , one can easily conclude that for the henon map ( @xmath64 ) the precision of the @xmath44 value used in calculations is not enough when larger number of iterations ( @xmath62 ) is used , whereas the curve coincides with that of the logistic case ( as expected ) if smaller number of iterations is used ( @xmath63 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth mentioning that the correct value of box counting fractal dimension @xmath65 of the critical attractor of the henon map , which is the maximum value of the @xmath18 curve , is consistent with the above discussion ( see fig .  2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , within the light of this analysis , these results are quite convincing to conclude that the @xmath14 value of the henon map which comes from the second method is the same as the one obtained from the first method . + </S>",
    "<S> * third method - *   finally , we shall use the third method ( i.e. , entropy increase rate procedure ) to estimate the proper @xmath14 value of the henon map in order to strengthen the results of the first and the second methods . to do this , </S>",
    "<S> we implement the following procedure @xcite : firstly , we partition the phase space into @xmath24 equal cells ( @xmath66 ) , then we choose one of these cells and select @xmath25 initial conditions all inside this cell . as time evolves , these @xmath25 points spread within the phase space , yielding a set of probabilities . in the beginning of time , naturally @xmath67 , then the entropy increase rate gradually exhibits three successive regions . </S>",
    "<S> the entropy is almost constant in time in the first region , then it starts increasing in the second ( intermediate ) region and finally saturates in the third one . among these regions , </S>",
    "<S> the intermediate one is the region where the linear increase of the proper entropy is expected to emerge @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> time evolution of @xmath68 for the henon map is given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that , in the intermediate region , the linear increase of the entropy with time emerges only for a special value of @xmath13 , and this value corresponds to the @xmath14 value ( within a good precision ) determined previously from the other two methods . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath69 , the entropy curves upwards ( if @xmath35 ) or downwards ( if @xmath34 ) . in order to quantitatively support this picture , we fit the curves with the polynomial @xmath70 in the intermediate region [ @xmath71 . since the nonlinearity coefficient @xmath72 is a measure of the importance of the nonlinear term , it should vanish for a strictly linear fit . in the inset of fig .  3 </S>",
    "<S> , we present the behaviour of @xmath73 from where we estimate the proper value of @xmath13 as @xmath74 , which is the value of the @xmath13 index when @xmath73 is strictly zero . </S>",
    "<S> + summing up , we analyzed the mixing properties of a two - dimensional dissipative map at the edge of chaos using three distinct methods that are developed and tested so far for many one - dimensional map families . </S>",
    "<S> as being the first example that numerically verifies the scenario in two - dimensional maps , this work would hopefully stimulate new projects addressing more general cases like high dimensional dissipative and/or conservative dynamical systems . along these lines , in an ongoing project which will be reported elsewhere </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze another two - dimensional map , the lozi - type map @xcite , to provide additional support for the present scenario . </S>"
