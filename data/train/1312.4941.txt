    "stokes equations is responsible for altering the flow dynamics including the anisotropisation of turbulent flows , but the underlying physical mechanisms are still poorly understood .",
    "another familiar phenomenon is that a three - dimensional ( 3d ) turbulent flow subject to a fast background rotation evolves towards a quasi - two - dimensional ( q2d ) state , which is characterised by a strong damping of velocity gradient components along the direction parallel to the rotation axis .",
    "+ the anisotropisation of turbulent flows induced by background rotation , has been the subject of several numerical and experimental investigations in the past , which led to important progress in the field .",
    "we briefly summarise the most important studies based on simulations and physical experiments , and the main observations .",
    "early laboratory experiments of rotating grid - turbulence were carried out in a wind tunnel  @xcite and focused , for example , on the decay of the kinetic energy and the energy dissipation rate  @xcite and on the confirmation of the role of the nonlinear nature of the transition from 3d to predominantly 2d flow dynamics of homogeneous turbulence ( predicted earlier by cambon _",
    "et al . _",
    "the increase of eulerian velocity correlations due to rotation and the temporal decay of the turbulent flow were already quantified during the seventies with an experiment where turbulent air flow in a rotating annular container was forced by a system of translating grids  @xcite . in 1976",
    "mcewan  @xcite revealed for the first time the concentration of vorticity in coherent structures in rotating turbulence .",
    "hopfinger and colleagues  @xcite investigated the large - scale effects of rotation on a turbulent flow , which was continuously forced locally in space , aimed at studying the population statistics of the vorticity tubes characterising the rotating flow .",
    "they also provided a detailed phenomenological description of the instabilities of such eddies for a specific rotation rate , their nonlinear mutual interactions and eventual breakdowns . during the last two decades ,",
    "direct numerical simulation ( dns ) of rotating turbulence ( decaying , or with large - scale forcing ) revealed additional information .",
    "for example , the important increase of velocity correlations along the direction parallel to the rotation axis , and the mild decrease of correlations along the perpendicular directions , with increasing system rotation  @xcite , and the increase of horizontal integral length scales with increasing rotation rate , followed by a decrease of the same horizontal integral scales for the fastest rotation rates  @xcite .",
    "the latter dns focused on the combined effects of the background rotation and the vertical ( top and bottom ) confinement on turbulence forced locally in space .",
    "recent laboratory experiments on rotating turbulence addressed several issues like intermittency  @xcite , coupling between inertial wave patterns , and turbulence decay using high - resolution particle image velocimetry ( piv )  @xcite , and accurate visualisations by means of reflective flakes of the formation and evolution of columnar eddies in rotating turbulence  @xcite .",
    "these visualisation experiments showed that  for initially inhomogeneous turbulence ",
    "large coherent vortices build - up in a time comparable with half the revolution period , compatible with linear effects , rather than on the longer time scale typical of nonlinear ones .",
    "the stereo - piv measurements by van bokhoven and coworkers  @xcite characterised the effects of rapid background rotation on the statistical properties of the same turbulent flow reported in the present paper .",
    "they explored the statistical homogeneity and ( planar ) isotropy of the velocity fluctuations , and extracted the integral time and length scales as function of rotation rate .",
    "in particular , they described , for the first time in laboratory settings , the reverse dependence on the rotation rate of the spatial horizontal correlation coefficients , as predicted earlier by numerical studies  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they observed a linear ( anomalous ) scaling of the longitudinal spatial structure function exponents in the presence of rotation . with the present - day computer resources ,",
    "a surge in large - scale dns of rotating turbulence has occurred , although mostly for periodic domains ( thus excluding the effects of confinement and in absence of ekman boundary - layer dynamics close to the domain walls )  @xcite .",
    "+ the experimental data available is still scarce and mostly of eulerian nature .",
    "recently , few studies have been reported on the three velocity components of the flow measured in a lagrangian manner by using 3d particle tracking velocimetry ( 3d - ptv )  @xcite .",
    "two of these studies were carried out in our laboratory , and focused on the lagrangian statistics of passive tracer velocities and accelerations in rotating turbulence for a sequence of rotation rates  @xcite .",
    "thanks to 3d - ptv , we have access to the vorticity vector , and studied its dynamics in rotating turbulence . for the non - rotating case , this kind of particle tracking studies has been pursued several years ago  @xcite , and rotating ptv experiments quantified the transition from 3d to q2d large - scale dynamics  @xcite . but laboratory experiments aimed at exploring the influence of system rotation on the dynamics of the small scales and in particular of the vorticity vector have not yet been reported and are the main topics of the present paper . in the context of the existing literature , the latter studies on the lagrangian statistics of velocities and accelerations of passive tracers , and the present work reported here on the geometrical statistics of the vorticity and the strain rate tensor in rotating turbulence are based on experiments resembling the ones performed in closed non - shallow containers , and with continuous forcing applied locally in space ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the forcing scheme adopted to continuously sustain the turbulence produces a flow which is similar to a taylor - green flow , resembling the driving mechanism used in many dns simulations of turbulence ( see , for example , ref .",
    "+ the present paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec2 ] , the theoretical background of geometrical statistics of the vorticity vector is briefly summarised .",
    "the experimental set - up is described briefly in section  [ sec3 ] , while more detailed information can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "based on our stereo - piv  @xcite and 3d - ptv experiments , the main features of forced rotating turbulence relevant for the present study is discussed in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "results from the study on some geometrical statistics of the flow will be presented in sections  [ sec5 ] ( the reference non - rotating case ) and in section  [ sec6 ] for the cases when background rotation is applied .",
    "finally , conclusions are summarised in section  [ sec7 ] .",
    "the governing equations to describe incompressible flows in a fluid subject to system rotation are usually the navier - stokes equations formulated for the rotating non - inertial frame of reference .",
    "they contain two additional contributions , the coriolis acceleration and the centrifugal acceleration .",
    "the latter is irrotational , therefore can be written as a gradient and is incorporated in the pressure gradient term . for a newtonian fluid , and in the presence of external forces , the navier - stokes equations read ( in tensorial notation ) : @xmath5 @xmath6 here , @xmath7 are the components of the velocity @xmath8 ( for later use we also introduce the notation @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 the components of the position vector @xmath11 , and @xmath12 the components of the velocity gradient tensor @xmath13 .",
    "the components of the system rotation @xmath14 are denoted by @xmath15 and those of the external force field @xmath16 applied to the fluid by @xmath17 . keeping the laboratory experiments in mind ,",
    "the system rotation is defined such that only the vertical component is non - zero , i.e. @xmath18 .",
    "finally , @xmath19 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid , and @xmath20 its density .",
    "+ it is also convenient to define here the nondimensional numbers which characterise a fluid flow according to the relative importance of the different terms in the momentum equation .",
    "indicating with @xmath21 and @xmath22 the typical length and velocity scales representative of the flow ( such as the integral length scale and the root mean square ( rms ) velocity of the turbulent flow , respectively ) , the ratio between the order of magnitude of different terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nsmomentum - rotating ] ) defines three relevant dimensionless parameters .",
    "the first is the reynolds number @xmath23 .",
    "the rossby number @xmath24 measures the relative importance of the coriolis force with respect to fluid inertia . for",
    "non - rotating flows @xmath25 , and for rapidly rotating flows we have @xmath26 . finally , the ekman number @xmath27 , which is a measure for the relative importance of viscous forces with respect to the coriolis force .",
    "+ for @xmath28 ( in the bulk of the flow , away from boundaries ) and @xmath29 , the viscous and advective terms may be neglected , and in steady conditions the fluid particle acceleration is solely determined by the pressure gradient and the coriolis force .",
    "such situation is known as the geostrophic balance , and it is of utmost importance for the dynamics of the flow in the atmosphere and in the oceans .",
    "from such an expression , the taylor - proudman theorem can easily be derived : @xmath30 .",
    "this theorem states the suppression of the velocity derivatives in the direction parallel with the rotation axis . + in order to understand the interactions between the terms of the equations of motion ruling a turbulent flow , it is useful to express them as functions of the vorticity vector @xmath31 .",
    "the vorticity evolution equation in the rotating frame of reference , derived by taking the curl of the navier - stokes equations ( [ eq : nsmomentum - rotating ] ) , reads : @xmath32 with the absolute vorticity defined according to @xmath33 ( note that @xmath14 is independent of both space and time ) .",
    "+ before we discuss in more detail the role of system rotation on vorticity dynamics , it is instructive to summarise the main results for homogeneous isotropic turbulence .",
    "it had already been recognised for more than 70 years , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite , that the velocity derivatives in the turbulent flow play a special role in vorticity dynamics in general , and in vortex stretching and tilting processes in particular . in the case of absence of system rotation ,",
    "the vorticity equation ( [ absvor - eq ] ) reduces to @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the strain rate tensor ( the symmetric part of the velocity gradient tensor ) .",
    "the term @xmath36 represents the stretching ( or compression ) and tilting of the vorticity vector operated by the velocity gradient . since the work by taylor  @xcite",
    ", the vortex stretching operated by the strain rate field is considered as a key  ingredient in the dissipative process of turbulence .",
    "the evolution of the local enstrophy , @xmath37 , and the local strain , @xmath38 , are expressed by the following equations : @xmath39 and @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "the evolution of the vorticity and strain fields are strongly connected , see refs .",
    "in particular , the dynamics of both fields are driven by self - amplification . as discussed by tsinober and coworkers  @xcite ,",
    "the production terms of enstrophy and strain are dominated by the terms @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the averaged production terms , in the following denoted by @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , have also been observed to be larger than the external forcing term by several orders of magnitude in numerically simulated turbulent flows .",
    "see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite and table ii in that paper .",
    "the numerical data revealed that both @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",

[ fig3 ] ) , the absolute value of the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath113 is strongly reduced by rotation ( and symmetrically distributed around @xmath114 ) , see the data for @xmath115 and @xmath116 in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the strain rate eigenframe is seen to have almost no preferential orientation with respect to the cartesian frame when no rotation is applied as the pdfs show more or less uniform distributions ( a remark concerning @xmath117 will follow below ) . with fast rotation , @xmath112 develops a strong preferential vertical alignment , while @xmath118 and @xmath119 get statistically horizontal .",

    "@xmath112 is perpendicular to the plane of motion , while the eigenvectors @xmath118 and @xmath119 lie in the plane .",
    "+ finally , we would like to add two remarks .",
    "first , it is curious to note that , for zero background rotation , the flow is characterised by a slight tendency of horizontal alignment of the third eigenvector ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "this indicates that compression in the flow happens more frequently in the @xmath124- or @xmath125-directions , rather than in the vertical one .",
    "this could be interpreted in view of the geometrical constraint of the flow in our experiment , which results from the aspect ratio of the fluid container @xmath126 .",
    "second , we do not fully understand the meaning of a preferential sign along a specific direction , which is observed in rotating and non - rotating runs for several pdfs shown above : see , _ e.g.",
    "_ , the slight tendency of @xmath118 to align with the vertical upward ( rather than downward ) direction for no rotation , or the strong tendency of alignment between @xmath112 and the same vertical upward direction in case of fast rotation .",
    "further investigation is being carried on in order to understand these issues .",
    "we performed a series of experiments of confined and continuously forced turbulence subjected to background rotation .",
    "a range of rotation rates @xmath0 was considered , from non - rotating to rapidly rotating turbulence with a maximum background rotation rate of @xmath1 rad / s ( with rossby number much smaller than unity ) . typically , the taylor - scale reynolds number in our experiments was around @xmath2 . based on the components of the strain rate tensor , measured in a lagrangian way by 3d particle tracking velocimetry",
    ", we have been able to quantify statistically the effects of system rotation on several flow properties .",
    "the experimental results show for the range of rotation rates considered how the turbulence evolves from almost isotropic 3d turbulence ( @xmath127 rad / s ) to quasi-2d turbulence ( @xmath4 rad / s ) .",
    "the two  dimensionalisation process induced by rotation has been quantified in terms of the modified alignment  in a statistical sense  of the vorticity vector with respect to the eigenframe of the strain rate tensor and by analysing the projection of the vorticity vector @xmath55 on the vortex stretching vector @xmath128 .",
    "when the rotation rate is increased , the probability of alignment of the vorticity vector with the intermediate eigenvector is amplified . at the same time",
    ", the same intermediate eigenvector tends to align statistically with the rotation axis , so that the first and third eigenvectors tend to lie in the plane of motion .",
    "this is consistent with the limit picture of 2d - turbulence , for which there exist only two eigenvectors ( and they lie in the plane of motion ) and the vorticity vector is perpendicular to the plane of motion .",
    "therefore the vorticity vector is perpendicular to both eigenvectors , and no stretching of vorticity is possible .",
    "the latter phenomenon has been confirmed by exploring the pdfs of the geometrical invariant @xmath129 for the range of rotation rates considered in this study .",
    "the absence of the vortex stretching mechanism is one of the main distinguishing features between the dynamics of 3d- and 2d - turbulence .",
    "finally , we have quantified the role of system rotation on the self - amplification terms of the enstrophy and strain rate equations and the direct contribution of the background rotation on these evolution equations .",
    "it turned out that the main effect of background rotation is a strong reduction of extreme events and a related strong reduction of the skewness of pdfs of several quantities , such as the intermediate eigenvalue of the strain rate tensor and the enstrophy and strain self - amplification terms .",
    "+ the present experimental investigations on rotating turbulence are carried out in a confined fluid with localised forcing ( near the bottom part of the container ) . as a consequence , both the presence of ekman boundary layers and of the forcing",
    "affect the dynamics of the turbulent flow , and the rms properties of the turbulent flow will show a decay in the vertical direction .",
    "this decay is substantial for the non- or weakly - rotating cases and relatively limited for rapidly rotating turbulence , see ref .",
    "statistically steady and homogeneous rotating turbulence is more easily achieved in dns .",
    "combination with state - of - the - art numerical studies on the lagrangian statistics of ( inertial ) particles , previously mostly applied to homogeneous isotropic turbulence ( see for a review ref .",

    "<S> the experimental results show how the turbulence evolves from almost isotropic 3d turbulence ( @xmath3 rad / s ) to quasi-2d turbulence ( @xmath4 rad / s ) and how this is reflected by several statistical quantities . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we have studied the orientation of the vorticity vector with respect to the three eigenvectors of the local strain rate tensor and with respect to the vortex stretching vector . </S>",
