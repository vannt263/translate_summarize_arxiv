    "the pseudogap regime of cuprate superconductors@xcite has remained mysterious despite more than two decades of intense research . among the various proposed explanations for the observed suppression of spectral weight below the doping - dependent pseudogap temperature @xmath7",
    "are phase - incoherent cooper pairing , symmetry - breaking orders competing with superconductivity , exotic fractionalized states , and short - range singlet correlations as precursor to the half - filled mott insulator.@xcite    nernst effect measurements have been established as an interesting probe of pseudogap physics .",
    "the nernst signal , measuring the transverse voltage induced by a thermal gradient , is typically small in conventional metals .",
    "large positive nernst signals are known to arise from the motion of vortices in type - ii superconductors.@xcite in underdoped cuprates , with experiments performed on a variety of different families , the nernst signal has been found to rise upon cooling , with an onset temperature significantly above the superconducting @xmath8 ( although it is difficult to define a sharp onset).@xcite the data have been commonly interpreted as evidence for fluctuating cooper pairs above @xmath8 ; this interpretation appears supported by the observation of fluctuating diamagnetism which often varies in proportion to the nernst coefficient.@xcite as function of doping , the onset temperature of the nernst signal is maximum around 10%15% doping and appears to lie below the @xmath7 line identified by other probes , in particular for doping @xmath9 .",
    "a plausible conclusion is that fluctuating cooper pairs do not account for all of the cuprate pseudogap .",
    "on the theory side , the nernst signal arising from gaussian ( i.e. amplitude ) pairing fluctuations has been calculated,@xcite and theoretical treatments of short - lived vortex ( i.e. phase ) fluctuations have been put forward as well.@xcite meanwhile it has also been established that a large nernst signal can occur in metals with a small fermi energy , in particular in the presence of electron and hole pockets.@xcite in underdoped cuprates , this situation has been discussed especially in a scenario of @xmath10-density wave order.@xcite    recently , a more detailed investigation@xcite of the nernst effect in the la@xmath11sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3(or `` 214 '' ) family revealed a new piece of information : in la@xmath0nd@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 , which is known to display static stripe order below a temperature @xmath12 , an additional ( positive ) peak or shoulder in the temperature dependence of the nernst signal could be identified , located at an elevated temperature and distinct from the low - temperature signal ascribed to superconducting fluctuations .",
    "as this high - temperature feature appears to follow the charge - ordering temperature @xmath12 upon variation of the doping level , it has been attributed to a fermi - surface reconstruction due to density - wave order .",
    "a fermi surface reconstruction due to density - wave order also appears as a candidate explanation for quantum oscillations , observed in large fields on underdoped yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6samples.@xcite indeed , neutron - scattering experiments indicate field - induced incommensurate spin - density wave order in this cuprate family.@xcite on the theory side , concrete symmetry - breaking patterns have been proposed to explain the observed quantum oscillations.@xcite among the various ordering phenomena , stripe order plays a prominent role : while first established in certain 214 cuprates and initially considered to be special to this family , signatures of ( possibly fluctuating or disordered ) stripes have meanwhile been found in a variety of cuprates over a significant doping range.@xcite + recent transport phenomenology in yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6  at hole concentration @xmath13 has shown close similarities to the 214 cuprates , including a sign change of the seebeck coefficient at @xmath14k and a strongly enhanced normal - state nernst signal accessed by strong magnetic fields of up to @xmath15 t .",
    "@xcite interestingly , the sign of the normal - state nernst effect is negative even at lowest temperatures , and theoretical explanations of how the sign of the nernst coefficent is related to fermi - surface reconstruction are lacking .    taken together",
    ", these developments suggest that density - wave order plays a vital role in the phenomenology of underdoped cuprates .",
    "it is thus of timely importance to clarify which experimental results can be understood in terms of density - wave order of conventional quasiparticles , and where physics beyond the quasiparticle picture needs to be invoked . in this paper",
    "we shall present a theoretical calculation of the normal - state nernst signal in the presence of uni - directional spin and charge density wave ( i.e. stripe ) order .",
    "in fact , in ref .  , it was argued that charge - density - wave fluctuations were important for the pseudogap nernst signal , and a general hydrodynamic discussion was presented at moderately high temperatures above a charge - ordering critical point . however",
    ", a specific comparison with experiment requires that we go to lower temperatures and consider the coherent dynamics of electronic quasiparticles .",
    "such an analysis was provided for the electron - doped cuprates in ref .  ,",
    "where it gave a good account for the experimental observations.@xcite    it is the purpose of the present paper to apply such a quasiparticle analysis to the hole - doped case , by combining a mean - field description of stripe order with a boltzmann approach to transport . at low temperatures ,",
    "the normal - state nernst signal varies linearly with @xmath16 , and we shall discuss the sign and magnitude of this piece in connection with the fermi - surface pockets induced by the density - wave order",

    "to observe this peak , eventually large magnetic fields have to be applied in order to increase spin stripe order and to decrease vortex contributions to the nernst coefficient .",
    "the model calculations presented so far have assumed the existence of metallic quasiparticles , with a large fermi surface in the underlying symmetry - unbroken state . in underdoped cuprates ,",
    "pseudogap phenomena are prominent in the temperature range @xmath265 where @xmath7 is the pseudogap temperature . according to photoemission experiments on bi@xmath4sr@xmath42cacu@xmath4o@xmath43 , @xcite the fermi surface is partially gapped , with fermi arcs remaining near the brillouin zone diagonals . in stripe - ordered la@xmath11ba@xmath2cuo@xmath3",
    ", @xcite only nodal points appear to survive as low - energy excitations below the stripe - ordering temperature .    although many theories have been proposed to explain the pseudogap regime  ranging from phase - fluctuating preformed cooper pairs over competing orders to mott physics and strong short - range antiferromagnetic fluctuations ",
    "its origin is still unclear.@xcite as already mentioned in the introduction , experimental data suggests that phase - fluctuating cooper pairs alone can not fully account for the observed pseudogap phenomena . with a lack of satisfactory descriptions of the pseudogap phase ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to a qualitative discussion in the following .",
    "regarding the relation between pseudogap and enhanced nernst coefficient at intermediate temperatures , different scenarios are conceivable , namely pseudogap and nernst coefficient may be caused by ( i ) the same or ( ii ) different phenomena . while the resistively defined pseudogap temperature seems to coincide with the onset of a rapid change in the nernst coefficient for dopings above 1/8 , the normal - state nernst coefficient",
    "is distinctly peaked near this doping , whereas the pseudogap continuously increases as the doping is reduced .",
    "we interpret this as evidence for scenario ( ii ) .",
    "then , the effect of translational symmetry breaking on the nernst coefficient may be investigated , without fully accounting for ( other ) possible sources of pseudogap phenomena  this is the logic underlying the approach presented in this paper .",
    "( note there is little doubt that the experimentally seen strong enhancement of the nernst coefficient at temperatures near @xmath8 is caused by superconducting fluctuations . )    in strong magnetic fields and at low temperatures , it is conceivable that the dominant source of corrections to the quasiparticle picture is given by phase - fluctuating pairing , with the phase incoherence becoming maximal near @xmath266 .",
    "one possible explanation how phase fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter are compatible with most of the phenomenology of the underdoped cuprates has been recently invoked in ref .  .",
    "in particular , in strong magnetic fields , appropriate to recent measurements of the nernst and hall effects , the influence of phase fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter was argued to lead mainly to a quasiparticle renormalization .",
    "the scattering of the quasiparticles on a fluctuating @xmath10-wave order parameter is described by the self - energy correction@xcite @xmath267 where @xmath268 is the phase decoherence rate of the order parameter amplitude @xmath269 and @xmath270 .",
    "this correction leads to the renormalized quasiparticle dispersion @xmath271 @xmath272 remarkably , the original fermi surface remains unchanged , and only renormalization of band masses and quasiparticle velocities by a factor @xmath273 occurs . since @xmath268 is of the order @xmath274 near @xmath266 , we may expect no qualitative change of transport properties due to phase incoherent pairing at magnetic fields of the order @xmath266 .    a final remark on fermi surfaces : while various photoemission experiments suggest truncated fermi surfaces in the form of arcs in the pseudogap regime , other experiments allow for an interpretation in terms of fermi pockets , which may be the result of symmetry - broken states ( as , in our case , stripes ) .",
    "the issue of arcs vs. pockets is not settled , however , it has been proposed that both matrix - element effects and disorder are responsible for the invisibility to photoemission of parts of the pockets.@xcite",
    "we have calculated the normal - state nernst coefficient in cuprates in the presence of stripe - like translational symmetry breaking .",
    "the calculations were based on a simple quasiparticle picture , combined with a boltzmann equation approach .",
    "the results demonstrate the role of fermi pockets for a large quasiparticle nernst coefficient .",
    "the existence of such pockets depends on details of the symmetry breaking order ; in particular charge order alone does not easily generate pockets , but spin order is required . depending on both spatial period and amplitude of the stripe order , both positive and negative nernst coefficients can be generated , with sign changes as function of the stripe amplitude which can be traced back to topological changes of the fermi surface .",
    "a robust positive nernst signal was mainly found for period-8 modulated antiferromagnetic order with @xmath275 , appropriate for cuprates with doping levels @xmath276 , as long as the magnetic order is not assumed to be unrealistically strong . for small charge modulation , there is little qualitative difference between bond - centered and site - centered stripes ; for larger charge modulation , site - centered stripes tend to destroy hole - like orbits and induce a negative nernst coefficient .",
    "charge order alone generates a small and typically negative nernst coefficient . finally , open orbits contribute a small nernst signal only , because off - diagonal transport coefficients are small for quasi - one - dimensional bands .",
    "the single - layer nernst signal was naturally found to be anisotropic , but the anisotropy was small , @xmath100/@xmath277 $ ] , for most parameter sets .",
    "exceptions were states with period-4 modulated charge order shown in fig .",
    "[ chargenernst ] . in these cases , hole pockets with large aspect ratios as shown in fig .",
    "[ purestripes]a ) can be present in the fermi surface and can lead to large anisotropies of the nernst signal .",
    "let us connect these results to experimental ones for the nernst coefficient in cuprates . clearly , both quasiparticles and phase - fluctuating pairing will contribute to the nernst coefficient , with the latter not being part of the calculation presented in this paper .",
    "this pairing - induced piece of the nernst coefficient has been studied before @xcite and is believed to dominate in a temperature region near the superconducting @xmath8 , whereas an extra piece has been identified at elevated temperatures in la@xmath0nd@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3.@xcite our positive quasiparticle nernst coefficient for period-8 stripes , figs .",
    "[ nernstdoping ] and  [ temperaturenernst ] , is in qualitative agreement with these experimental results . as function of temperature ,",
    "the quasiparticle nernst signal peaks below the charge ordering temperature @xmath12 , vanishes linearly as @xmath278 and becomes negative at high @xmath16 , fig .",
    "[ temperaturenernst ] .",
    "( adding a pairing - induced positive peak at low @xmath16 would give a temperature dependence similar to experiment . ) experimentally , the temperature maximum of the extra piece in the nernst signal appears to be above @xmath12 , which may be explained in terms of strong precursor stripe fluctuations not captured in our mean - field theory .",
    "the doping dependence of the quasiparticle nernst signal in the doping range @xmath279 , fig .",
    "[ nernstdoping ] , is in qualitative agreement with experiment as well .    for magnetic modulation periods larger than 8 sites , the quasiparticle nernst signal displays sign changes as function of the modulation amplitude . from this , we predict sign changes in the nernst signal as function of temperature ( in compounds with well - established stripe order ) or as function of applied field ( if the order is primarily field - induced ) .",
    "indeed , in a recent experiment@xcite on yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6  at @xmath280 , corresponding to a doping level of 0.12 , the nernst effect at a field of 28 t was found to be negative in the low - temperature limit .",
    "the signal showed substantial field dependence for smaller fields , with large positive contributions near @xmath8 due to superconducting fluctuations , but those have been argued to be negligible in the regime above 25 t . assuming that such fields induce sizeable sdw order with a modulation period larger than 8 ( note that the observed spin correlations@xcite in yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6  do not follow the relation @xmath225 )",
    ", these findings could be consistent with our calculations .",
    "clearly , experiments on more underdoped yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6  samples are called for .",
    "the huge anisotropy of the nernst signal , found recently in yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath6  at intermediate temperatures,@xcite can not be easily explained in terms of magnetic stripe states .",
    "instead , an interpretation@xcite in terms of nematic order near a van - hove singularity appears more appropriate , while stripe order may set in at lower temperatures ( where indeed the experimental nernst anisotropy decreases ) .",
