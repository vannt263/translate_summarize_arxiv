    "does an inhomogeneous universe evolve on average like a homogeneous solution in the framework of general relativity ?",
    "this question is not new @xcite and naturally emerges in view of the nonlinearity of the theory and , in particular , from the generally non  commuting operations of averaging and time evolution @xcite . the main difficulty to answer it resides in the notion of averaging and in its construction ( see , e.g. , @xcite , section 2.2 of @xcite ,  and references therein ) .",
    "our universe is supposed to verify the strong cosmological principle which demands homogeneity and isotropy at all scales .",
    "this standard approach , known as friedmann  lematre  robertson  walker ( flrw ) cosmology ,  is widely used in order to describe the dynamics of our universe and the formation of its constituents .",
    "it however leaves in suspense an explanation about the origin of dark energy and dark matter ,  which respectively represent in this model about @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the total content of the universe .",
    "this last point might actually reveal a symptom of a deeper problem linked to this approach .",
    "indeed ,  in flrw cosmology one determines background quantities regardless of the scale and makes them evolve according to a homogeneous  isotropic solution of einstein equations .",
    "our first query could be reformulated in order to note the central aspect of this issue : are the background quantities well defined within standard cosmology ,  i.e.  as a suitable average over the inhomogeneities ? is their _ evolution _ well approximated in this framework ,  i.e.  is the time dependence of the homogeneous  isotropic _",
    "averaged state _",
    "well approximated by a homogeneous  isotropic _ solution _",
    "?    we shall adopt an approach that averages , in a domain  dependent way ,  the scalar parts of einstein s equations with respect to synchronous free  falling observers in a dust model @xcite ,  a realization of the averaging problem that does not answer the above questions in the affirmative .",
    "the average evolution of an inhomogeneous universe differs from the evolution of a homogeneous one ;  in other words ,  even if we are entitled to describe structure formation in terms of perturbations of a background ,  this latter is generally not a member of the homogeneous solutions ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this difference of evolution is driven by the non  trivial geometrical structure of an inhomogeneous space ,  featuring deviations that are known as `` backreaction '' .",
    "these backreaction effects can act on average ,  at least qualitatively ,  as the dark components .",
    "the set of equations obtained within this approach should be closed to derive the evolution of all the involved quantities ,  namely the effective scale factor ,  the averaged scalar curvature deviation and the kinematical backreaction variable . in recent papers ,",
    "attention was turned to a closure under the assumption of global constraints such as a globally stationary universe @xcite ,  or by exploring the solution space with exact scaling laws for the backreaction and the averaged scalar curvature @xcite ,  or by symmetry requirements such as spherical symmetry ( e.g.  @xcite , and references therein ) . in this work",
    "we want to choose the closure relation by focusing on the particularity of the model to unify the dark components through backreaction . according to this point of view",
    ",  the chaplygin gas ( cg ) seems to be an interesting lead since it unifies dark matter and dark energy in only one fluid , obeying an exotic equation of state @xcite .",
    "this unification is made through the evolution of this particular fluid and it can be extended to a unification where both dark components are _ simultaneously _ modelled thanks to the scale dependence of our approach .",
    "these points motivate us to build a model in which the generically existing coupling between the backreaction and the averaged scalar curvature deviation ,  which encodes the particular geometrical structure evolution of an inhomogeneous universe ,  is furnished by a scale  dependent cg equation of state .    in section [ sec - inhomcosm ]",
    "we introduce the equations that govern the average evolution of an inhomogenous universe model and briefly discuss them .",
    "we present in section  [ sec - cg ] the cg and some of its properties . in section [ sec - bcg ]",
    "we suppose that the backreaction and the averaged scalar curvature deviation are coupled according to the cg equation .",
    "the cg then describes a particular geometrical structure of the inhomogeneous universe and does not correspond to any fundamental field .",
    "finally ,  in section  [ sec - cosparm ] ,  we reformulate the results obtained in terms of effective cosmological parameters ;  we compare this model to the friedmannian framework and we study in particular the acceleration of a spatial domain .",
    "restricting attention to a universe filled with irrotational dust ,  i.e.  irrotational pressureless matter ,  we spatially average the scalar parts of einstein equations ( the hamiltonian constraint , raychaudhuri s equation and the continuity equation ) with respect to a collection of comoving ( generalized fundamental ) observers over a compact ,  restmass preserving spatial domain @xmath2 ,  and obtain the following set of equations ( @xcite , @xcite for details ) :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the effective volume scale factor    @xmath5    with @xmath6 the initial volume of the domain and @xmath7 its volume at a proper time @xmath8 , @xmath9 the density of irrotational dust averaged over @xmath2 , @xmath10 the spatial scalar curvature averaged over @xmath2 and @xmath11 the kinematical backreaction    @xmath12    with @xmath13 the rate of expansion and @xmath14 the rate of shear with the shear tensor components @xmath15 .    equations ( [ eff - fried-1 ] ) and ( [ eff - fried-2 ] ) govern the kinematics of the effective scale factor and equations ( [ eff - fried-3 ] ) and ( [ eff - fried-4 ] ) express the conservation law for the dust matter and the backreaction terms , respectively .",
    "it is important to point out that @xmath10 might evolve differently from its friedmannian counterpart ( as we shall discuss in subsection [ subs - limitw ] ) . upon introducing the averaged scalar curvature deviation @xmath16 ,",
    "we may rewrite equation ( [ eff - fried-1 ] ) in the form    @xmath17    looking now at equations ( [ eff - fried-2 ] ) and ( [ eff - fried-5 ] ) one should note that both the backreaction and the averaged curvature , through @xmath18 , induce a change in the averaged dynamics of the domain in comparison with the friedmannian framework .",
    "equation ( [ eff - fried-2 ] ) states that a positive backreaction contributes to accelerate the expansion of the domain and then plays against gravity : @xmath19 effectively mimics a dark energy behaviour over @xmath2 .",
    "the domain will actually undergo an acceleration of its expansion only if the ` intensity ' of dark energy is sufficient ,  which is the case when @xmath20 .",
    "a negative backreaction contributes to decelerate the domain expansion and therefore adds to gravity : @xmath21 effectively mimics a dark matter behaviour over @xmath2 .",
    "for the averaged model we may suppose that backreaction acts as dark matter on small scales ( e.g.  galaxy cluster and void scales ) and as dark energy on the largest scales ( cmb and high  redshift supernovae ) .",
    "in the present work , this differentiation with respect to the spatial scale will however not be made explicit .",
    "an explicit multi  scale dynamics can be formulated to refine such a description @xcite .",
    "we shall assimilate here the properties of the spatial geometrical structure to a _ domain ",
    "dependent _ cg .",
    "to this aim we first describe the backreaction variables in terms of an effective perfect fluid whose energy density and pressure read to describe the fluid , instead of the full averaged scalar curvature @xmath10 .",
    "first , @xmath22 incorporate the deviation from a general friedmannian model , being equivalent to the pair @xmath23 only in a zero  curvature friedmannian model .",
    "second , the kinematical backreaction and the curvature deviation both vanish on the background and are gauge  invariants ( as shown to second  order in perturbation theory @xcite ) . ]",
    "@xmath24    we stress here that , since it is an effective description , this fluid does not have to satisfy any energy conditions ( as discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore reformulate equations ( [ eff - fried-1 ] ) and ( [ eff - fried-2 ] ) casting them into friedmannian form    @xmath25    using the last two equations together with equation ( [ eff - fried-3 ] ) one obtains the conservation law for the backreaction fluid    @xmath26    which , if written out , reflects the generic coupling between the curvature deviation and the kinematical backreaction  a simple reformulation of equation ( [ eff - fried-4 ] ) :    @xmath27",
    "the cg is a perfect fluid obeying the state equation    @xmath28    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are respectively the energy density and the pressure of the fluid in a comoving frame and @xmath31 is a positive constant .",
    "it was first introduced as a cosmological fluid unifying dark matter and dark energy by kamenshchik _",
    "et al _ @xcite and has been since widely studied in this context ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the equation of state ( [ chapyglingas ] ) has also raised interest in particle physics thanks to its connection with string theory @xcite and its supersymmetric extension @xcite .",
    "the generalization of the cg @xcite ,    @xmath32    with @xmath33 a free positive parameter ,  is commonly used in cosmological models ;  however in the present work we shall consider for simplicity the case @xmath34 ,  i.e.  the standard cg ) , is straighforward .",
    "we emphasize that , even if the standard cg does not seem to well fit with observations in a flrw model , this must not be the case in our approach , since observational data have to be reinterpreted before the need for such a generalization is justified ( cf section [ sec : concl ] ) . ] . assuming that the gas verifies the energy conservation law over a spatial domain @xmath2 ,    @xmath35    we obtain ,  making use of relation ( [ chapyglingas ] )",
    ",  the expressions    @xmath36    where @xmath37 determines the initial conditions of the cg and both @xmath38 and @xmath39 depend on the domain .",
    "note that equations ( [ chap_evol ] ) describe the evolution of a homogeneous cg which is the one of interest in our work since the backreaction terms are , due to the averaging procedure ,  homogeneous over a spatial domain .",
    "however , since we average over inhomogeneities , there certainly exist interesting links to the inhomogeneous cg ( for an investigation of the latter the reader is referred to @xcite ) .",
    "we now recall briefly of the different aspects of the cg according to the sign of @xmath39 .",
    "we follow @xcite to present the behaviour of the cg for a positive @xmath39 .",
    "expressions  ( [ cgevol ] ) become for small values of the scale factor ,  @xmath40 ,    @xmath41    which indicates that the cg can behave as a dark matter component . for large values of the scale factor ,",
    "@xmath42 , it follows that    @xmath43    which reflects the dark energy  like behaviour of the cg in its last stage .",
    "finally , one may also develop ( [ cgevol ] ) for large values of @xmath4 to obtain    @xmath44    between the phases ( [ cgdm ] ) and ( [ cgde ] ) the cg can be seen as a mixture of a cosmological constant and a stiff fluid whose pressure and energy density are equal .",
    "to resume ,  for a positive @xmath45 , the cg acts first as dark matter and then as dark energy whose state equation evolves towards the one of a cosmological constant .",
    "as already noticed in @xcite the cg presents another interesting feature for a negative @xmath39 since its density increases with the scale factor .",
    "in this situation it plays the role of phantom dark energy , and it evolves at late times towards a cosmological constant . for the pressure and energy density to be well defined one needs    @xmath46    it therefore exists a minimal value for the scale factor , @xmath47 ,  implying that this case describes a bouncing universe model at early times",
    "as we have outlined in section  [ sec - inhomcosm ] , the backreaction fluid inherits a _ simultaneous _ unification of the dark components thanks to its scale dependence .",
    "we want to build a model in which this fluid is assimilated to the chaplygin gas in order to physically shape the behaviour of the backreaction and the curvature deviation on a given spatial scale , while also allowing for a metamorphosis of the ` dark character ' through evolution . in this model ,",
    "the chaplygin gas emerges from the inhomogeneous structure of the universe , and is not related to any fundamental field .",
    "we then consider that the backreaction fluid responds to the scale  dependent state equation ( [ chapyglingas ] ) over a spatial domain @xmath2 .",
    "using definitions ( [ back - fluid ] ) ,  we rewrite expression ( [ chapyglingas ] ) in the form    @xmath48    since no energy condition has to be verified by the backreaction fluid , we may also consider the chaplygin equation of state ( [ chapyglingas ] ) with a negative energy density ( and hence a negative @xmath49 if one wants to preserve the negativity of the pressure ) .",
    "however ,  we shall restrict ourselves in this paper to the case where the backreaction fluid satisfies ( [ chapyglingas ] ) under the usual conditions , i.e.  with a positive energy density and a positive @xmath49 .",
    "we thus have to respect , in view of expression ( [ chapconst ] ) , the following constraints , which we call the _ chaplygin fluid constraints _ :",
    "@xmath50    or , equivalently ,    @xmath51    in this situation , the curvature deviation of any domain is negative at any time whatever its dynamics could be .",
    "we also note that @xmath11 and @xmath52 evolve in such a way that relation ( [ bf - cst ] ) is always satisfied ( see figure [ fig : iso - a ] ) . rewriting equation ( [ bf - cst ] ) as a function @xmath53 under the chaplygin fluid constraints ,",
    "we derive ,  for a given @xmath49 ,  the maximal value of the deviation term @xmath54 obtained for @xmath55 .",
    "we shall see in subsections [ subs - limitw ] and [ subs - limitq ] that these values form an attractor for the dynamics of the system .    ) for a different @xmath49 ( its value arithmetically increases from the curves on the right to the ones on the left ) under the chaplygin fluid constraints . for a given @xmath49 ,  whatever their evolution could be ,",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath52 run on the corresponding iso@xmath49 curve .",
    "the dots represent the maximal value of the curvature deviation for each @xmath49 .",
    "a negative @xmath11 mimics dark matter and a positive @xmath11 dark energy . ]      inserting expressions ( [ back - fluid ] ) into the evolution laws ( [ cgevol ] ) results in    @xmath56    we may express the constants @xmath49 and @xmath45 in terms of the initial values of the backreaction @xmath57 and the curvature deviation @xmath58 over @xmath2 ,    @xmath59    and determine the evolution of @xmath52 and @xmath11 in the form    @xmath60    where the new terms are defined as    @xmath61    the chaplygin fluid constraints imply @xmath62 and @xmath63 . the evolution of @xmath11 and @xmath52 is entirely determined by the initial values @xmath57 and @xmath58 of the domain or ,  equivalently ,  by @xmath33 and @xmath64 .",
    "the opposite sign of @xmath65 gives the sign of @xmath45 , equation ( [ binit ] ) , and therefore defines the behaviour of the chaplygin backreaction fluid .",
    "the rate of change @xmath66 shows that the curvature deviation grows with @xmath4 . for large values of the scale factor , @xmath67",
    ", we get    @xmath68    which takes the form , using equation ( [ ainit ] ) ,    @xmath69    where @xmath70 has been introduced before .",
    "thus ,  for a given @xmath49 ,  the curvature deviation increases towards its attractor @xmath70 , for which the departure from the friedmannian curvature is maximum .",
    "for @xmath71 the curvature deviation is initially set to @xmath70 and then does not evolve .",
    "it is important to remark that there exists an infinite number of couples @xmath72 or ,  equivalently ,  @xmath73 which yield the same @xmath49 under the chaplygin fluid constraints .",
    "for all of them @xmath18 will live on the same iso@xmath49 curve and will tend towards the same attractor ( see figure [ fig : iso - a ] ) .      for large values of the scale factor , @xmath67 ,",
    "we have    @xmath74    or , equivalently , using equation ( [ ainit ] ) ,    @xmath75    where @xmath76 has been introduced before .",
    "the backreaction tends at late times towards a domain  dependent cosmological constant whose value is given by the initial conditions @xmath33 and @xmath64 on the domain",
    ". the same remark as in subsection [ subs - limitw ] can be made for @xmath11 .",
    "one needs to distinguish the following cases ( see figure [ fig : iso - a ] ) .    1 .   for @xmath77",
    "the backreaction is always positive and hence only acts as dark energy over the domain . in this situation ,",
    "since @xmath78 is negative , @xmath11 behaves as dark energy whose intensity decreases until reaching the attractor @xmath76 .",
    "we recall in this case the existence of a minimal scale factor @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath62 implies @xmath80 .",
    "2 .   for @xmath71",
    "the system is initially set on the attractor ; thus it does not evolve .",
    "the backreaction always acts as a cosmological constant .",
    "3 .   for @xmath81",
    "we have a positive @xmath78 .",
    "two subcases arise according to the initial value @xmath57 : 1 .   for @xmath82 the backreaction acts as dark energy",
    "whose intensity increases until reaching the attractor @xmath76 ; 2 .   for @xmath83",
    "the backreaction changes its sign during its evolution .",
    "it first behaves as dark matter whose intensity decreases , and then as dark energy whose intensity increases until reaching the attractor .",
    "the moment of the transition dark matter ",
    "dark energy depends on the initial values of the domain since @xmath84 .",
    "we conclude by emphasizing some of the characteristics of the model .",
    "first , the cg relates the backreaction terms of our inhomogeneous universe model and therefore furnishes a particular manifestation of its inhomogeneous structure .",
    "our model does not suppose the existence of any other fundamental field , contrary to the approach of a flrw universe filled with dust and cg .",
    "second , the role and the evolution of the backreaction depend on the domain considered and on its initial values . as a consequence",
    "this model could be seen as an effective multi  scale model .",
    "for instance @xmath11 might act as dark matter on small scales ( situation ( iii)-(b ) ) with a dark energy transition occuring at very late times , and as different kinds of dark energy on larger scales ( situations ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii)-(a ) ) .",
    "the backreaction fluid might also be described by a minimally coupled real scalar field @xmath85 ,  called the morphon field @xcite ,  evolving in an effective potential @xmath86 ,  as follows :    @xmath87    where @xmath88 for a standard scalar field ( with a positive kinetic energy ) and @xmath89 for a phantom scalar field ( with a negative kinetic energy ) .",
    "the last expressions together with relations ( [ back - fluid ] ) give    @xmath90    the system evolves towards the maximal value of the curvature deviation @xmath70 , as seen in subsection [ subs - limitw ] , which corresponds to the minimal value of the potential . with correspondence ( [ pot - field ] )",
    "the integrability condition ( [ integrability ] ) implies that @xmath91 , for @xmath92 , obeys the scale  dependent klein  gordon equation    @xmath93    the above correspondence allows us to interpret the kinematical backreaction effects in terms of the properties of scalar field cosmologies , notably quintessence or phantom  quintessence scenarii that are here routed back to models of inhomogeneities . the morphon field",
    "may also be characterized by the domain  dependent equation of state @xmath94 ,  which assumes in our model the form    @xmath95    for @xmath96 ,  the morphon field acts as dark matter and ` standard ' dark energy as mentioned in subsection [ posb ] . in this situation",
    "we have @xmath97 and @xmath98 at late times . for @xmath99 ,",
    "it behaves as phantom dark energy as mentioned in subsection [ negb ] . in this case",
    "we have ,  since @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 at late times .",
    "we stress again that the phantom character is an effective property in our description ;  no fundamental phantom field is assumed to exist @xcite .",
    "finally ,  for @xmath103 ,  the morphon field mimics a scale  dependent cosmological constant and we have @xmath104 .",
    "using equations ( [ evol - r ] ) and ( [ evol - q ] ) , relations ( [ morphfield ] ) become    @xmath105    the scalar field dynamics can be reconstructed by evaluating the following integral , e.g.  to find @xmath106 :    @xmath107 \\big(\\alpha \\beta + 2 \\ , \\alpha \\gamma \\ , a^{-6}_{{{\\cal d } } } \\big)^{1/2 } }   \\ , , } \\ ] ]    where the prime denotes the derivation w.r.t .  the volume scale factor .",
    "this relation does not seem analytically integrable in the general case . in the vacuum with a zero  friedmaniann curvature ( @xmath108 ) ,",
    "expression ( [ scalar_field ] ) becomes    @xmath109    from this last relation , we get the following expression for a standard scalar field ( @xmath110 and @xmath81 ) :    @xmath111    where @xmath112 is an integration constant . the potential is then written @xcite    @xmath113    for a phantom scalar field ( @xmath114 and @xmath77 ) we get from the relation ( [ field_vacuum ] )    @xmath115    and the potential reads    @xmath116    note that this last expression can be obtained directly from relation ( [ stand_vaccum ] ) by the simple reparametrization @xmath117 .",
    "this is obvious in view of the form of the kinetic term of the morphon field : for a standard scalar field it is written @xmath118 and for a phantom field @xmath119 .    in the following section",
    ", we reformulate the different results obtained in this section in terms of effective cosmological parameters and we study the dynamics of the model .",
    "expressed through the domain  dependent cosmological parameters    @xmath120    where @xmath121 is the volume hubble functional , the averaged hamiltonian constraint ( [ eff - fried-1 ] ) assumes the form @xcite",
    "@xmath122    the chaplygin fluid constraints ( [ chapconsti ] ) may be expressed as    @xmath123    equations ( [ evol - r ] ) and ( [ evol - q ] ) furnish the evolution laws for @xmath124 and @xmath125 :    @xmath126    where the new terms are defined by    @xmath127    the sign of @xmath128 determines the behaviour of @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "one may reformulate constraints ( [ chapconstii ] ) in terms of the initial conditions ,    @xmath131      equation ( [ hamiltonomega ] ) together with equations ( [ evol - omr ] ) and ( [ evol - omq ] ) provide the evolution equation for the hubble functional ( see appendix a for the study of @xmath132 in a particular case ) :    @xmath133    @xmath132 tends , at late times , towards    @xmath134      one finds , for large values of the scale factor ,    @xmath135    it is interesting to note that the cosmological parameters tend towards a value independent of the initial conditions ( see appendix a for the study of @xmath129 and @xmath130 in a particular case ) .",
    "we may also introduce the cosmological parameter @xmath136 , the so  called x  matter , defined as    @xmath137    we have noticed in section [ sec - inhomcosm ] that the kinematical backreaction might explain the origin of dark matter and dark energy , and we have presented its behaviour in subsection [ subs - limitq ] . if one wants to compare our model to a scale  dependent friedmannian cosmology in terms of cosmological parameters ,  @xmath136 has to be considered as the origin of the dark components , instead of @xmath130 alone .",
    "this simply means that the curvature deviation ,  since it also participates in the departure from the friedmannian framework ,  may also act ,  qualitatively ,  as the dark components .",

    "the latter case is an interesting situation : the kinematical backreaction is responsible for two accelerated phases .",
    "our model only concerns the matter  dominated universe ; however this situation allows to imagine that the primordial inflation and the one occuring today might be driven by the same effect studied in a more general model .",
    "we have built in this paper a model in which the backreaction fluid acts as a domain  dependent effective cg , focusing for simplicity on the case where its effective energy density is positive .",
    "the behaviour of the kinematical backreaction only depends on the initial conditions of the domain and may correspond to dark matter or different types of dark energy according to the scale and the time evolution .",
    "our model kinematically resembles a friedmannian cosmology with two fluids ( dust and cg ) , but conceptual implications differ .",
    "first , the origin of dark energy ( or , in the extreme case , of both dark components ) is related to the non  trivial geometrical structure of an inhomogeneous space ; we do not assume the existence of other fundamental constituents or fields .",
    "second , the geometrical structure that complies with the chaplygin equation of state can in principle be verified by concrete inhomogeneous models and also observationally ; the model is no longer phenomenological in the sense that no free parameters remain .",
    "free parameters in the standard approach ( being homogeneous ) are here traced back to the initial data for the inhomogeneities and are therefore , in this sense , not arbitrary .",
    "any fitting of observational data of our model will lead to unambiguous initial data that can be constraint by structure formation .",
    "third , one has to be careful when cosmological observables are derived .",
    "indeed , angular diameter and luminosity distances , for instance , depend on metrical properties .",
    "these latter are affected and related , in our description , to the averaged scalar curvature , which evolves differently compared with its friedmannian counterpart .",
    "it is therefore necessary to reinterprete observational data , using e.g.  the lines of the analysis performed for the exact scaling solutions in @xcite . in light of this remark",
    "it is premature to exclude @xcite the standard chaplygin equation of state as providing a good match with observational data .",
    "the construction of an effective metric for a cosmology with a chaplygin backreaction fluid and a comparison with observations are the subjects of a future work .",
