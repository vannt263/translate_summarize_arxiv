    "recent advances in ultrafast laser material processing enable nano - sized structures to be directly fabricated in various materials  @xcite .",
    "the basic processes during femtosecond laser ablation are absorption by electrons , energy transfer to the lattice and subsequent material removal .",
    "these processes are all temporally well separated  @xcite .",
    "the first step , the absorption of light , is a complex and interesting problem .",
    "as the laser pulses are focused into a spot size comparable to the wavelength of the laser light , the interaction between the light and the material takes place in a very confined volume .",
    "furthermore , due to the high peak intensities involved , nonlinear optical effects play a dominant role .",
    "typically , when a laser pulse propagates through a semiconductor or an insulator , multi - photon absorption takes place during the leading part of the pulse .",
    "this leads to the generation of a high concentration of charge carriers .",
    "when a laser pulse impinges on a metal , the existing free electrons in the metal will be strongly heated by the leading part of the pulse . in both cases",
    "the leading part of the pulse alters the optical properties of the material , which implies that the trailing part of the laser pulse interacts with a material whose optical properties are significantly different from those of the unexcited material .",
    "a detailed numerical modeling of this process provides insights into the complex mechanism of energy deposition under these conditions and is therefore crucial to describe laser nano - processing .    in earlier one - dimensional models of the absorption of femtosecond laser pulses in silicon",
    ", the dynamically changing optical properties were taken into account using a nonlinear lambert - beer law , with absorption coefficients that change dynamically due to the generation of free carriers .",
    "the results of these models are in good agreement with reflectivity measurements performed with weakly focused laser beams   @xcite . however , these one - dimensional models are expected not to be adequate to describe the laser - matter interaction in sub - wavelength volumes and with the large focusing angles obtained with high numerical aperture objectives . in other studies ,",
    "the propagation of femtosecond laser pulses in nonlinear media is simulation by solving the non - linear schrdinger equation ( nlse )  @xcite .",
    "however , the self - scattering by the sub - wavelength plasma formed during nano - ablation  @xcite implies the breakdown of the slowly - varying - amplitude - approximation on which the nlse is based .",
    "additionally , the high numerical aperture objective used to focus the beam implies the breakdown of the paraxial approximation , another approximation used in the derivation of the nlse . due to these limitations of the nlse , there is an increasing interest in the development of numerical models that resolve the full set of maxwell s equations coupled to the equations describing the changes in the materials induced by the pulse under tight focusing conditions  @xcite .",
    "however existing studies do not address laser - matter interaction in metals , do not find quantitative agreement with experiments or lack a comparison to experiments .    in this paper",
    ", we present a numerical model of the laser energy deposition in femtosecond laser nano- processing of both semiconductors and metals .",
    "the model simulates the propagation of light using a two - dimensional finite difference time domain ( fdtd ) method , coupled to a set of differential equations that describe the changes in the material properties that are driven by the laser light .",
    "the model is compared with self - reflectivity measurements of a strongly focused femtosecond laser beam in single - shot ablation experiments on silicon and gold .",
    "we show that the model excellently describes the self - reflectivity measurements on the four types of specimens we investigated , namely two silicon - on - insulator samples with different device layer thickness , bulk silicon and gold .",
    "we further show that in the case of strong focusing , a one - dimensional model does not reproduce the experimental results and that a two - dimensional model is thus required .",
    "as our model excellently agrees with the experimental results , without the use of fitting parameters , it can be used to study and optimize the energy deposition in femtosecond laser nano - processing of materials .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : theory ] we discuss the theoretical model we use to describe the propagation of an intense laser pulse in a medium of which the optical properties are changing during the pulse . in section  [ sec : model ] , we describe in detail the numerical implementation of that model . in section  [ sec : exp_and_model ] , we compare the results of the model to experimental results . a summary and conclusion are presented in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the propagation of electromagnetic waves is in general governed by maxwell s equations @xmath0 in combination with relations defining the auxiliary fields @xmath1 the above relations are specific to the medium and can be modelled using microscopic theories . in a linear and homogeneous medium , we can write @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the electric susceptibility and @xmath5 is the magnetic susceptibility . for electromagnetic waves at optical frequencies ,",
    "the magnetic susceptibility is almost always negligibly small .",
    "we will therefore neglect it in the remainder of this paper and only consider the electric susceptibility . in",
    "the simple linear and homogeneous case , the above set of equations can be easily cast into a wave equation which can then be solved analytically .",
    "however , in relevant cases , the susceptibility is not homogeneous .",
    "in that situation , one in general needs numerical methods to solve maxwell s equations .",
    "furthermore , when sufficiently strong fields are applied , nonlinear effects can come into play .",
    "for example , absorption of light by the medium can result in the generation of free charge - carriers .",
    "these free carriers will contribute to the susceptibility . as this will make the susceptibility depend on the intensity of light inside the medium",
    ", free - carrier generation also leads to inhomogeneity even in case of an initially homogeneous medium .",
    "local heating of the material has a similar effect , as it locally changes the refractive index and thus makes the medium inhomogeneous .        in many cases ,",
    "the change in the local susceptibility are small and slow enough to be negligible when considering the propagation of light . however , when using focused pico- or femtosecond pulses , the changes in local susceptibility occur during the pulse itself . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : simple_model ] , this requires one to solve the equations governing the dynamics of the properties of the material , which is driven by the intensity of light .",
    "this intensity is obtained by solving the maxwell s equations , which use the material properties as an input .",
    "if we assume that the susceptibility changes slowly with respect to the oscillation period of the light , we can neglect time derivatives of the susceptibility and thus write the time derivative of the displacement field as @xmath6 .",
    "this reduces the maxwell s equations to @xmath7 where we have introduced the dielectric function @xmath8 .    to determine the susceptibility",
    ", we need to determine certain position- and time - dependent properties of the material .",
    "for instance , we require the carrier density @xmath9 , which we can obtain by integrating the diffusion equation @xmath10=s_n({\\bf e}({\\bf r},t ) ) , \\label{eqn : carrier_density_1}\\ ] ] where the source term @xmath11 depends on the intensity of light ( and thus on the electric - field amplitude ) as absorption of light leads to the formation of free carriers .",
    "the carrier density distribution obtained from the diffusion equation is subsequenty used to calculate position- and time - dependent susceptibility ( and thus the dielectric function ) @xmath12 where we have now explicitly written the susceptibility as a function of the carrier density .",
    "the dots indicate that the susceptibility is also a function of other properties of the medium , such as electron temperature , lattice temperature , etc .. if these are expected to vary on the timescale of the pulse , additional equations need to be include to describe their dynamics .    in the next section",
    ", we will follow the outline given above to derive a model to describe the self - reflectivity of a semiconductor structure subjected to intense femtosecond laser illumination .",
    "we will explicitely discuss the physical processes that should be taken into account and give details of the numerical implementation of the model .",
    "as described in the previous section , we need to solve a set of equations to describe how the dielectric function evolves during the laser pulse .",
    "which equations we need to solve depends on the material used . here",
    "we describe the relevant sets of equations required to model the self - reflectivity of a semiconductor as well as a metal under ablation conditions and show that the model is in excellent agreement with experimental results for both types of materials .",
    "the first process during the absorption of a femtosecond laser pulse by a semiconductor is the excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band .",
    "depending on the band gap of the material and the incident photon energy , the excitation can be either one - photon absorption or multi - photon absorbtion or both .",
    "subsequently , electrons already excited to the conduction band can gain energy in the laser field via free - carrier absorption .",
    "if the excess energy of a conduction electron is sufficiently high , it may excite another electron in the valence band to the conduction band , by a process known as impact ionization .",
    "when this process occurs multiple times , it is referred to as avalanche or cascade ionization . for silicon at @xmath13 excitation wavelength ,",
    "free carriers are created by one - photon absorption ( opa ) , two - photon absorption ( tpa )  @xcite , and impact ionization  @xcite . generally , impact ionization is a very complicated process that involves the energy distribution of the electrons  @xcite .",
    "here we use a simplified and convenient expression for the impact ionization term , deduced by stuart _ et .",
    "we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eqn : carrier_density_1 ] ) as @xmath14&=&\\frac{\\alpha_0 i({\\bf r},t)}{\\hbar\\omega}+\\frac{\\beta i^2({\\bf r},t)}{2\\hbar\\omega}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\theta i({\\bf r},t)n({\\bf r},t ) , \\label{eqn : carrier_gen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the carrier diffusivity , @xmath16 is the opa coefficient , @xmath17 is the tpa coefficient , and @xmath18 is the impact ionization coefficient .",
    "the intensity @xmath19 that appears in the source term on the right - hand side of the above equation is the laser intensity inside the medium , which can be obtained from the amplitude of the time - varying electric field in the material using @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the real part of the refractive index @xmath22 .",
    "we deduce the impact ionization coefficient @xmath18 from the experimental results obtained by pronko  _ et al . _ who measured the impact ionization rate ( @xmath23 ) for the dielectric breakdown in silicon with @xmath24 fs laser pulses .",
    "@xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : impact_rate_silicon ] , we plot their results as a function of intensity . fitting the data yields an impact ionization coefficient @xmath25 .",
    "is obtained by a linear fit of the data presented in ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=317 ]    due to the creation of a high density of carriers , the optical response of silicon under ablation conditions is dominated by the free - carrier response , which can be calculated using the drude model  @xcite . in our model",
    ", we also take into account the changes in the dielectric constant due to the optical kerr effect and tpa .",
    "thus the dielectric function of strongly excited silicon ( @xmath26 ) can be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the dielectric constant of unexcited silicon at @xmath29  @xcite and @xmath30 is the carrier collision time , which is believed to be around @xmath31  @xcite at the excitation level relevant for this work .",
    "finally @xmath32 is the optical effective mass of highly excited silicon , which we will discuss later in this section .",
    "the third - order susceptibility @xmath33 can be calculated from the value of the kerr coefficient @xmath34 and the value of tpa coefficient @xmath17 in silicon . the refractive index",
    "@xmath22 and the effective absorption coefficient @xmath35 of the excited material are @xmath36 although the carrier temperature does not explicitely appear in the above equations for the dielectric function , we nevertheless have to calculate it .",
    "this is because the carrier diffusivity @xmath15 and the optical effective mass @xmath37 depend on the carrier temperature . to model the change of the carrier temperature @xmath38 during the pulse",
    ", we use a heat equation  @xcite @xmath39}{\\partial t}+\\nabla\\cdot[-\\kappa_c\\nabla t_c({\\bf r},t)]=\\alpha_{\\rm ex } i({\\bf r},t ) .",
    "\\label{eqn : electron_temperature}\\ ] ] the total energy density @xmath40 of the excited carriers is given by @xmath41 with @xmath42 the carrier heat capacity , @xmath43 the band gap energy and @xmath44 the thermal conductivity of the carriers .",
    "as the carrier temperature reached at the excitation level relevant to this work exceeds @xmath45 , the induced plasma is nondegenerate even at high densities  @xcite .",
    "thus , the carrier heat capacity and the carrier heat conductivity can be approximated using classical thermodynamics  @xcite , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath48 the thermal velocity of carriers , @xmath49 the carrier effective mass and @xmath30 the carrier - carrier collision time .",
    "the carrier diffusivity is then found using the einstein relation  @xcite @xmath50 in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors determine a static optical effective mass of the femtosecond laser - induced plasma in silicon using time - resolved pump - probe experiments .",
    "however , as the optical effective mass is both temperature and density dependent , it will actually change during the pulse . for the carrier temperatures relevant for this work , the fermi - dirac reduces to a boltzmann distribution , resulting in an effective mass that is independent of the carrier density  @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence remains and is easy to understand ; when the electrons are heated up far beyond the conduction band edge , the curvature of the band decreases , giving rise to a larger effective mass . in this case , the optical effective mass increases approximately linearly with carrier temperature  @xcite . as experimental measurements of the optical effective mass",
    "are based on the drude model , they only depend on the ratio @xmath51 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : epsilon_excited_silicon ] ) ) .",
    "so to measure @xmath49 one needs to know the carrier density @xmath52 , which in our case is a - priori unknown .",
    "therefore , we use the relation suggested by riffe s theoretical calculation which takes the detailed band structure of silicon into account .",
    "his calculation shows that the optical effective mass can in our regime be approximated by @xmath53 where the optical effective mass of unperturbed silicon @xmath54 is well - known to be @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "we extract the slope @xmath56 from riffe s calculations  @xcite .      in the case of femtosecond laser ablation of gold ,",
    "the optical absorption process is somewhat different .",
    "as there is already a high density of free electrons present in the unexcited material , the number of free electrons is not significantly influenced by the laser pulse .",
    "the dominant absorption mechanism is therefore the heating of those electrons . in analogy with eq .",
    "( [ eqn : electron_temperature ] ) we use @xmath57}{\\partial t}+\\nabla\\cdot[-\\kappa_e\\nabla t_e({\\bf r},t)]=\\alpha_{\\rm ex } i({\\bf r},t ) , \\label{eqn : electron_temperature_gold}\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath58 denotes that the only charge carriers are electrons . at the high electron temperatures reached during ablation , we can approximate the electronic heat capacity as @xmath59 where the electron density @xmath52 is now kept constant during the simulation .",
    "the change of electron temperature gives rise to a change in the drude damping time which is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62  @xcite are the scattering rates for electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions , respectively . in the future",
    ", the model could be improved by taking the electron heat capacity from detailed band structure calculations  @xcite .",
    "the dielectric function can be written as , @xmath63 where @xmath64 an is offset to the dielectric function that takes into account the effect of resonances at shorter wavelengths .",

    "once every optical half - cycle , we extract the electric - field amplitude @xmath69 from that optical half - cycle .",
    "details of how we extract the amplitude can be found in appendix  [ app : amp_extraction ] . from the electric - field amplitude ,",

    "<S> we present a numerical model which describes the propagation of a single femtosecond laser pulse in a medium of which the optical properties dynamically change within the duration of the pulse . </S>",
    "<S> we use a finite difference time domain ( fdtd ) method to solve the maxwell s equations coupled to equations describing the changes in the material properties . </S>",
    "<S> we use the model to simulate the self - reflectivity of strongly focused femtosecond laser pulses on silicon and gold under laser ablation condition . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the simulations to experimental results and find excellent agreement . </S>"
