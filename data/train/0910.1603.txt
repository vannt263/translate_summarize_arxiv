    "due to the advent of large area surveys in the past few years , extensive progress has been made in the search for low - mass active galactic nuclei ( agns ) with estimated black hole masses @xmath14 . through searches for galaxies with low stellar velocity dispersions or weak broad - line emission in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ,",
    "the number of candidate broad - line type 1 @xcite and narrow - line type 2 @xcite low - mass agns has increased to number in the hundreds .",
    "multi - wavelength studies ( e.g. gallo et al .  2008 , satyapal et al .",
    "2008 ) have begun to provide new avenues for finding these low - mass and low - luminosity agns that would not typically be identified in the optical , allowing us to observe a larger portion of the total energy output .",
    "x - ray observations are of key importance for detecting the primary ionizing continuum of the agn and determining the total luminosity as well as constraining the obscuration toward the central engine .",
    "current unification schemes explain the observational differences between type 1 and type 2 agns by the viewing angle from which we observe the central engine . for a type 2 object , an obscuring torus blocks the light coming from the innermost region , which contains the broad emission - line and x - ray - emitting regions . therefore in the classical agn unification picture @xcite",
    ", a type 2 object will show the underlying properties of a type 1 object if the effects of the obscuration are removed .",
    "hence , type 1 and 2 objects with comparable black hole masses and luminosities should also show similar optical narrow emission - line spectra , since the narrow - line emitting region remains largely unobscured . by systematically searching for galaxies of both types 1 and 2 with similar stellar velocity dispersions and narrow emission - line luminosities",
    ", one can develop comparable samples of type 1 and type 2 objects with similar black hole masses to test if the unified model is applicable across the full range of black hole masses found in agns , or if the lack of broad emission lines in low - mass type 2 objects results from changes in the structure of agns at low bolometric luminosities @xcite rather than due to absorption .",
    "the two best studied agns with @xmath15 are located in the late - type spiral ngc  4395 @xcite and in the dwarf elliptical pox  52 @xcite , respectively .",
    "ngc  4395 has been shown to vary rapidly in the x - ray @xcite , including dramatic changes in spectral slope ( @xmath16 , moran et al .",
    "2005 ) over a few years .",
    "pox  52 shows similar rapid variability , along with substantial changes in the absorbing column density in @xmath17  year @xcite . additionally , _",
    "xmm - newton _  and _ chandra _  have been used to investigate the x - ray properties of low - mass type 1 agn samples @xcite showing that they seem to be scaled down versions of their more massive counterparts with similar hardness ratios and photon indices .",
    "the x - ray properties of the type 2 counterparts of these agns have not previously been studied systematically .",
    "we present _ xmm - newton _  observations of four galaxies selected from the low - mass seyfert 2 sample of @xcite to have the lowest stellar velocity dispersions in the sample in order to quantify the absorption and emission properties of this population .",
    "our goal is to investigate whether obscuration can explain the lack of broad - line emission in low - mass seyfert 2 galaxies . from measurements of x - ray luminosities and spectral fitting",
    ", we estimate intrinsic absorbing column densities , bolometric luminosities , and corresponding eddington ratios in order to investigate the differences between type 1 and type 2 objects in this mass range . throughout this paper",

    "this is up to an order of magnitude larger than the luminosities derived in this work and could be larger if a substantial amount of absorbing material were present at the time the _ rosat _",
    "observations were taken .",
    "variations of this magnitude have been observed before and are typically explained by variations in the absorbing material , especially at such soft energies .",
    "the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 4388 was observed to have a factor of @xmath115 increase in flux due to an order of magnitude decrease in the absorbing column density , typically at @xmath120 @xcite , over the course of a year .",
    "similarly , ngc 4358 has shown order of magnitude variations in the @xmath121 kev luminosity due to @xmath122 variations in the absorbing column density over a one month time period @xcite .",
    "this object has also seen factors of @xmath123 variations in absorbed flux due to continuum variability and not changes in the obscuring material .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to expect that the change in flux for both sdss  j103234  and sdss  j144012  are due to either continuum or absorbing column density variability or a combination of both .",
    "sdss  j103234  and sdss  j144012  are the only objects in the sample with high enough s / n for spectral fitting , albeit over a limited range of energy . in both objects ,",
    "the source spectrum becomes indistinguishable from that of the background at the high - energy end , due to low source counts .",
    "we choose to minimize the cash @xmath124 statistic @xcite in order to optimize the spectral fits instead of the often used @xmath125 statistic because it does not require a minimum number of counts per bin and the results are independent of the bin size used ( for further discussion , see cash 1979 ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath124 statistic is more reliable than the @xmath125 statistic when fitting low s / n spectra .",
    "due to low s / n , sdss  j103234  could only be fit over the @xmath126 kev energy range and therefore the data were rebinned to 15 channels per bin at energies @xmath127 kev and 80 channels per bin for energies @xmath128 kev in order to increase the s / n in each bin . at energies above @xmath129 kev , the number of source counts in a given bin were comparable to the background level and therefore , no useful spectral information could be extracted . because of the degeneracies involved in fitting such a small spectral region with multiple components , we first fit a simple absorbed power law .",
    "we first allowed the absorbing column density to vary freely , but this produced an absorbing column density of zero .",
    "therefore , we fixed the absorbing column density to the minimum value possible , the galactic value of @xmath130 for all following model fits .",
    "the best fit ( @xmath131 using 18 pha bins and 16 dof ) was a @xmath132 power law that shows strong , systematic residuals at the soft and hard - energy ends of the spectrum ( see figure [ 1032spec ] ) .",
    "x - ray studies of low - mass type 1 seyfert galaxies often show a soft excess , presumably due to a thermal component , with similar temperatures and strengths to those seen in narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies @xcite . modifying the model to include a thermal disk blackbody and allowing all parameters to vary freely ( except for the column density for reasons discussed above ) resulted in an unrealistic photon index of @xmath133 .",
    "using the same absorbed power law with a thermal blackbody model , we tested setting the power - law slope to @xmath134 , increasing this slope by @xmath135 increments in subsequent model fits until @xmath136 , while allowing the blackbody temperature to vary freely .",
    "this allowed us to test more complex models over our limited energy range , while still keeping the number of free parameters to a minimum . using this technique",
    ", we found the model fit with the photon index set at @xmath134 produced the best result and therefore , we fix the photon index to @xmath137 , the value derived from the hr , for all further model fits . fixing the photon index to this value in the absorbed power law and thermal blackbody model improves slightly ( @xmath138 using 18 pha bins and 15 dof ) with a blackbody temperature of @xmath139 kev , but still slightly underpredicts the spectrum at energies of @xmath140 kev .",
    "finally , we note that this spectrum flattens out at energies @xmath128 kev , similar to the flattening seen at energies between @xmath141 kev in the _ xmm - newton _  spectrum of pox  52 when it was observed to be in a partially - covered state @xcite . with this in mind ,",
    "we add a partial - covering component to our model and keeping the galactic absorber fixed , we again test the incremental photon index values , finding similar results as before .",
    "we therefore fixed the photon index to value derived from the hr , @xmath137 and find the best fit ( @xmath142 using 18 pha bins and 13 dof ) from this model includes a @xmath143 kev blackbody and an additional absorbing column density of @xmath144 covering @xmath145 of the x - ray - emitting region .",
    "this model is more complex than the previous models tested , but better fits the flattened region between energies @xmath141 kev . if this model accurately describes the observed emission , we would expect to see the spectrum of sdss  j103234  decrease at energies @xmath146 kev and follow the shape of the power - law component .",
    "additional observations with a higher s",
    "/ n are needed to confirm this prediction , but based on the data currently available , we select the partially - covered absorbed power law as our best - fit model",
    ". we also note that we modeled the spectrum using multiple background regions surrounding the source and saw no significant changes that might affect our conclusions as to the best - fit model .",
    "the spectrum of sdss  j144012  extends from @xmath147 kev , above which the s / n is too low for spectral fitting , and was rebinned to 10 channels per bin .",
    "we start with a simple absorbed power - law model with the absorption fixed to the galactic value ( @xmath148 ) , with the understanding that the best - fit power law may not accurately describe the intrinsic underlying continuum over the full @xmath149 kev range .",
    "the left panel of figure [ 1440spec ] shows the spectrum of sdss  j144012  over - plotted with the best - fit @xmath150 power law ( @xmath151 using 13 pha bins and 11 degrees of freedom , dof ) . this power law is steeper than what is commonly seen in seyfert 1 galaxies @xcite and does not fit energies below @xmath152 kev well .",
    "we also tested allowing the column density to vary freely , but this did not improve the fit quality and so we choose the galactic value for simplicity .",
    "therefore , the simple absorbed power law is a poor model for describing the x - ray spectrum of this source .    in order to better fit the soft - energy end of the spectrum",
    ", we added a thermal component to the absorbed power law .",
    "we first added a blackbody component to the absorbed power law , allowing the thermal temperature of the blackbody and the photon index of the power law to vary freely , while holding the column density fixed to the galactic value , for the reasons discussed above .",
    "this model was unable to fit the peak in the spectrum , seen at @xmath153 kev , despite the range of parameter values tested , resulting in typical cash statistics of @xmath154 .",
    "next , we tested replacing the blackbody component with a hot , diffuse plasma model , using either the raymond - smith plasma @xcite or the mekal plasma @xcite models .",
    "we tested both of these models individually , fixing the redshift parameter to @xmath155 and the abundance parameter to the solar value .",
    "we again tested allowing the column density to vary freely , but found the best results were achieved when the absorbing column density was fixed to the galactic value .",
    "all other parameters were allowed to vary freely in each component . using the raymond - smith plasma component produced a best fit ( @xmath156 using 13 pha bins and 9 dof ; figure [ 1440spec ] ) with a power - law photon index of @xmath157 and a plasma temperature of @xmath158 kev .",
    "this temperature is within the range of typical values of @xmath159 kev seen in narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies and pg quasars @xcite .",
    "the model using the mekal plasma component resulted in a very similar best fit ( @xmath160 using 13 pha bins and 8 dof ) , with a mekal plasma temperature of @xmath161 kev and a corresponding photon index of @xmath162 .",
    "we note that the photon indices of both of these models are not well constrained with lower bounds of @xmath163 .",
    "this is most likely due to the very small energy range over which we are attempting to fit these models .",
    "both model fits are nearly indistinguishable from each other , except that the mekal model uses one additional free parameter .",

    "if sdss  j110912  is indeed a `` true '' type 2 seyfert , this scenario can not explain the lack of the broad - line region .",
    "alternatively , if the blr is formed due to a radiation - driven wind flowing off of the accretion disk , as has been suggested by @xcite , then at very low luminosities the outflow may decrease to levels unable to sustain the blr .",

    "2003 ) has explored a model in which there exists a threshold @xmath12  below which the radiation - driven wind is unable to produce the broad - line emission .",
    "this suggests that at lower @xmath12 , unobscured agns would be `` true '' type 2 objects .",
    "the calculations of @xcite show that this threshold lies at @xmath236 , below which the objects would be unable to produce the broad - line region .",
    "using the x - ray results , we can examine where these low - mass agns lie relative to the predicted thresholds for blr formation .",
    "we find that sdss  j103234  and ngc  4395 both have eddington ratios close to the hypothetical threshold for blr formation in the nicastro model ( ngc 4395 : @xmath237 ; peterson et al .",

    "sdss  j110912  has a very uncertain eddington ratio of @xmath238 which lies at the threshold for blr formation in the nicastro model .",
    "therefore , there exists the possibility that sdss  j110912  accretes at a low enough rate to explain the lack of broad - line emission .",
    "however , this seems unlikely given that sdss  j110912  and ngc 4395 have such similar narrow emission - line luminosities , and presumably similar ionizing luminosities .",
