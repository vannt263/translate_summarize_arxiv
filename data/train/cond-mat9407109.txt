    "the electromagnetic properties of tunnel josephson junctions are a subject of intensive studies over the past three decades @xcite .",
    "a considerable attention is , in particular , attracted to the investigation of the sis  type josephson contacts . in this case",
    "the tunnel junction is formed by a thin layer of an insulator .",
    "this dielectric layer between two superconducting plates can be treated as a transmission line or a parallel plate resonator when the electromagnetic properties are concerned .",
    "it follows from this approach that an electromagnetic wave with a specific dispersion relation may propagate along the sis  type josephson junction @xcite .",
    "the existence of this swihart electromagnetic wave results , in particular , in the self - induced resonances , usually referred to as fiske steps @xcite .",
    "these specific resonances are observed as peaks in the current - voltage curves of the tunnel josephson junctions .",
    "the study of fiske steps is one of the methods to treat the electromagnetic properties of the sis  type josephson contacts .",
    "recently , it was successfully applied to investigate the electromagnetic properties of the grain boundaries in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 high - temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "the self - induced fiske resonances are observed in the presence of an external magnetic field , @xmath3 . in this case",
    "the phase difference between the two superconductors forming the tunnel contact , @xmath4 , is a sum of two terms , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath5 .",
    "the first term , @xmath6 , describes the increase of @xmath4 along the josephson junction ( @xmath7-axis ) .",
    "the value of @xmath6 is proportional to the magnetic field @xmath3 and is given by the formula @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the london penetration depth and @xmath10 is the flux quantum .",
    "the second term , @xmath11 , represents the increase of @xmath4 in time .",
    "the value of @xmath11 is proportional to the voltage , @xmath12 , applied to the contact , and is given by the formula @xmath13 . as a result",
    "the tunnel current density @xmath14 is described by a wave propagating along the josephson junction @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of this wave is given by the josephson critical current density , @xmath15 .",
    "the self - induced fiske resonances arise when the frequency of the tunnel current density wave , @xmath16 , becomes equal to the frequency of the swihart electromagnetic wave @xcite .",
    "thus , the dependence of the frequency , @xmath17 , on the wave vector , @xmath18 , for an electromagnetic wave propagating along the josephson junction determines the positions of the peaks in the current - voltage curve of a tunnel contact .",
    "usually , the dispersion relation @xmath19 is determined by the sin - gordon equation that leads to @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the josephson frequency , c is the specific capacitance of the tunnel junction , and @xmath22 is the josephson penetration depth .",

    "it means , in particular , that for an electromagnetic wave propagating along the josephson junction with @xmath29 the dispersion relation @xmath26 is valid in the region @xmath30 .",
    "let us now discuss the general case , _",
    "i.e. _ , the case when the restrictions on the wave vector @xmath18 are given by the inequalities @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the thickness of the insulating barrier and @xmath34 is the coherence length .",
    "we treat here an sis - type josephson junction formed by two superconducting plates . in this case",
    "the space distribution of @xmath4 is one - dimensional and the relation between the phase difference @xmath27 and the magnetic field in the superconductors is nonlocal if @xmath35 . as a result",
    "the function @xmath27 is determined by an integro - differential equation @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , the electrodynamics of a josephson junction is nonlocal as far as the region of wave vectors @xmath35 is concerned . using this equation it was shown @xcite that the dispersion relation for an electromagnetic wave with @xmath35 takes the form @xmath36    the phase velocity of this electromagnetic wave is inversely proportional to the square root of the wave vector @xmath18 .",
    "it results in a non - equidistant set of the values of the voltage @xmath12 corresponding to the self - induced resonances in the current - voltage curve .",
    "this effect is most pronounced when considering an sis - type josephson junction in a thin superconducting film with the thickness @xmath37 . in this case",
    "the space scale of magnetic field variation in the superconductors forming the contact is given by the pearl penetration depth @xcite @xmath38    thus , the electrodynamics of a josephson junction in a thin film is nonlocal if @xmath39 .",
    "this region of wave vectors is much wider than the one given by the inequality @xmath35 .    in this paper",
    "we consider an infinite one - dimensional josephson tunnel junction in a superconducting film with the thickness @xmath37 .",
    "we show that the electrodynamics of a josephson contact is nonlocal if the space scale of variation of @xmath4 is less than the pearl penetration depth , _",

    "we treat here the case when @xmath40 , in which the london equations govern the fields and currents inside the superconductor .",

    "the quantities @xmath41 , @xmath44 and @xmath47 are nearly independent on the _ z _ coordinate in the limiting case of a thin film , _",

    "the current density @xmath41 in this plane is determined then by the averaging of eq .",
