    "a recent triumf experiment @xcite designed to measure the rate of the radiative muon capture ( rmc ) reaction @xmath0 has sparked a renewed interest in this process . since it is more sensitive to the nucleon pseudoscalar form factor @xmath3 than its non - radiative counterpart ( refs .",
    "@xcite are two reviews on ordinary muon capture ) , it is an ideal candidate for checking the value of this form factor which is theoretically predicted by pcac ( partial conservation of axial current ) . with the experiment on - going , it is necessary to have a modern theoretical calculation of the process to interpret the anticipated experimental results . in this paper",
    ", we have calculated the rate of the process using two perspectives : a nuclear perspective via the elementary particle model ( epm ) and a nucleon perspective via the impulse approximation ( ia ) .    the only similar calculation for this process",
    "was done by klieb and rood @xcite about twenty years ago but the accuracy of their calculation is constrained by the facts that 1 ) the trinucleon wave function they used is inadequate by today s standards , 2 ) some of the nucleon momentum terms were handled in an approximate way and 3 ) they did not use the full adler and dothan amplitude but included only some of the adler and dothan terms . as a consequence of better computer technology and better methods of calculation of realistic trinucleon wave functions , it has been possible in this calculation to improve on the approximations they made .",
    "the analogous nonradiative , or ordinary muon capture ( omc ) , reaction has been considered by several authors . see for example refs .",
    "@xcite , and references cited therein .",
    "in section [ sec : trans_amp ] we will briefly discuss various hypotheses governing the weak hadronic current and the adler and dothan @xcite procedure which provides terms in addition to terms generated by a naive insertion of photons on each particle with charge or magnetic moment ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for early work on this topic and ref .",
    "@xcite for an alternative presentation of the adler and dothan procedure ) .",
    "the elementary particle model approach is discussed in section [ sec : epm ] , where both @xmath4 and @xmath5 nuclei are treated as single entities with internal structure revealed only by the phenomenological nuclear form factors taken from experiments .",
    "we will then discuss the impulse approximation approach in section [ sec : ia ] .",
    "the essence of the impulse approximation is that it regards the radiative capture process as taking place on the constituent nucleons . assuming that the nucleons are free",
    ", one then uses a trinucleon wave function to integrate out the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the resulting amplitude will be one which only depends on the epm , or external , degrees of freedom .",
    "the results will be presented in section [ sec : res ] and a summary in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the fundamental terms of the transition amplitude are obtained by inserting a photon on all particles carrying charge or magnetic moment .",
    "figure ( [ rmc_ext_rad ] ) shows the feynman diagrams corresponding to these terms .",
    "note that this general approach is common to both epm and ia so that the form of the transition amplitude derived here will be applied to the nucleus in the epm , but to the nucleon in the ia .",
    "the amplitudes corresponding to the diagrams in fig .",
    "( [ rmc_ext_rad ] ) are @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the feynman propagator for spin @xmath8 particles ( @xmath9 for example ) , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the four - momenta of the neutrino , muon and the emitted photon respectively and @xmath13 is the weak hadronic vertex which is parameterized by four form factors @xmath14 with all the @xmath15 s functions of @xmath16 , the square of the momentum transfer at the weak hadronic vertex . specifically , we denote @xmath17 as the momentum transfer at the hadronic vertex when one of the hadrons is radiating and @xmath18 as the momentum transfer when the lepton is radiating .",
    "@xmath19 where @xmath20 denote the electric charge and anomalous magnetic moment of the initial ( final ) particle . the induced pseudoscalar coupling , @xmath21 , which originates from the pion pole term has the form @xcite @xmath22 which comes from pcac and the goldberger - treiman relation for ordinary muon capture . the quantity @xmath23 can be regarded as a constant over the @xmath16 concerned @xcite .",
    "the `` pcac '' value of @xmath21 is defined as @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is the pion - i - f coupling constant . in the epm ,",
    "the hadronic vertex is at the nuclear level .",
    "therefore , @xmath26 ( four momentum of the @xmath4 nucleus ) and @xmath27 ( four momentum of the @xmath5 nucleus ) . in the ia ,",
    "the hadronic weak interaction operator acts on the constituent _ nucleons _ and so @xmath28 ( four momentum of the proton ) and @xmath29 ( four momentum of the neutron ) .",
    "note also that @xmath30 is the mass of nucleus in the epm but the mass of nucleon in the ia and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) is used to denote the mass of muon ( charged pion ) throughout .    however , the sum of these four diagrams is not gauge invariant ( gi ) and does not satisfy cvc and pcac by itself .",
    "extra terms must be added in order for the whole transition amplitude to be gauge invariant and to satisfy cvc and pcac up to a desired order .",
    "the adler and dothan procedure is used to generate these terms up to @xmath33 via the gi requirement and @xmath34 via the cvc and pcac hypotheses .",
    "the extra piece of amplitude that is required is @xmath35 a prime on a form factor denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "since all the form factors ( except @xmath21 which contains a pole term ) are almost linear in @xmath16 over the range of @xmath16 concerned in both the epm and ia , it does not matter with respect to which @xmath16 the derivative is taken .",
    "the pion pole terms of @xmath21 are treated exactly .",
    "the term @xmath36 in @xmath37 arises when one does a minimal substitution on the hadronic vertex , assuming constant form factors , and corresponds to the usual fifth diagram included in previous rmc calculations ( fig.([minimal_coupling_rad ] ) ) .",
    "if the nuclei or nucleons were elementary particles with no form factors , this would be the only term needed in @xmath37 in order to ensure gi , cvc and pcac of the amplitude .",
    "the other terms in @xmath37 involving derivatives of form factors are the terms to account for the composite nature of both the nuclei ( in the epm ) and the nucleons ( in the ia ) . the term @xmath38 is demanded by the cvc and pcac while the terms in @xmath39 are demanded by the gauge invariance requirement in the case when form factors are included . and the last two terms in @xmath39 . ]    the full amplitude @xmath40 satisfies gi , cvc and pcac up to , but not including , terms of @xmath41 and this is the amplitude that we will use for later calculations .",
    "the _ elementary particle model _ is probably the simplest method to calculate the rmc rate .",
    "it was first used by kim and primakoff @xcite in calculating the beta decay of complex nuclei and was subsequently used by fearing @xcite and klieb and rood @xcite in their rmc calculations . in this approach , both the @xmath4 and @xmath5 are treated as `` elementary particles '' of spin @xmath8 and isospin @xmath8 up to a small isospin breaking .",
    "the details of the structure of the nuclei are encapsulated in the nuclear form factors which are determined by experiments done on these nuclei .",
    "one of the major reasons the epm calculation is easier than the ia is that there are many fewer degrees of freedom which one has to take care of in the epm than in the ia .",
    "the degrees of freedom in the epm approach are the four - momenta of @xmath4 ( @xmath42 ) , @xmath5 ( @xmath43 ) , photon ( @xmath12 ) , neutrino ( @xmath10 ) and muon ( @xmath11 ) together with their respective spins .",
    "the four - momentum conservation relation is @xmath44 the differential capture rate ( photon spectrum ) is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the differential phase space factor @xmath47 here @xmath48 denotes the muon wave function at the origin , @xmath49 @xcite is the correction factor that accounts for the non - pointlike nature of the nucleus , and @xmath50 is the ckm matrix element which connects the up and down quark , with @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 is the fermi coupling constant , @xmath53 is the density matrix which describes the initial spin configuration of the muonic atom , and @xmath54 is the transition amplitude @xmath55 that was discussed in section ( [ sec : trans_amp ] ) with the following name changes @xmath56 where @xmath57 are the nuclear form factors which are parameterized as @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "the photon polarization vector @xmath60 , which is defined by @xmath61 , with @xmath62 , has the property @xmath63 thus the @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ diff_cap_rate ] ) can be replaced by @xmath65 .",
    "the big advantage of the epm is its simplicity .",
    "it also includes , to some extent at least , part of the meson exchange corrections which are missing in the ia .",
    "it however does have a major flaw as applied to a two step process such as rmc in that the intermediate states have to be treated as elementary particles as well .",
    "thus effects coming from excitation of the intermediate nucleus , which are implicitly partially included in the ia , are not included in the epm .",
    "a full investigation of this is beyond the scope of this paper , though see ref .",
    "however one should keep this in mind as a caveat with respect to the epm .",
    "the impulse approximation method provides a simple `` microscopic '' picture of the nuclear reaction in terms of nucleons . in this picture , the constituent nucleons inside the nucleus are approximated as free ( this is probably a good approximation as the binding energy of the trinucleon system is @xmath668 mev , which is about 0.3@xmath67 of the mass of the nucleus ) and the nuclear reaction @xmath68 is viewed as the sum of its nucleon counterparts @xmath69 ( that is , only one - body currents are considered and two - body meson exchange currents are neglected or put in later as a correction ) .",
    "the extra degrees of freedom which arise from considering each nucleon of the nucleus instead of treating the nucleus as a whole are integrated out using realistic tri - nucleon wave functions . given these assumptions ,",
    "the whole problem boils down to separating the epm and non - epm degrees of freedom and finding the ia equivalent ( denote it as @xmath70 ) of @xmath54 in the epm .",
    "more explicitly , we want the @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ diff_cap_rate ] ) to be replaced with @xmath70 in order to find the ia version of @xmath71 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath72 and @xmath70 is : @xmath73 where @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) denote the four momenta of the three initial ( final ) nucleons @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the ( three ) momentum transformation separating the epm and non - epm degrees of freedom is @xmath79 for the initial nucleus , with an identical transformation law for the final nucleus .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath80 ( a epm degree of freedom ) is the center of mass momentum vector of the nucleus and @xmath81 ( a non - epm degree of freedom ) is the momentum of nucleon @xmath76 ( spectator ) with respect to the center of mass momentum of the other two nucleons ( subsystem ) while @xmath82 ( a non - epm degree of freedom ) is the momentum of particle @xmath77 with respect to particle @xmath78 and @xmath81 will sometimes be denoted as @xmath83 and @xmath84 when no confusion arises . ] .",
    "the @xmath85 comes from the antisymmetrization of the wave function and it allows one to let the current operator act on a particular nucleon ( chosen to be nucleon @xmath76 ) three times instead of acting on each nucleon of the nucleus .",
    "the parameterization of the nucleon form factors is exactly the same as that of the nuclear ones ( see eq .",
    "( [ nuclear_ff ] ) ) . for convenience in notation ,",
    "we change @xmath86 and @xmath87 in eq .",
    "( [ nuclear_ff ] ) to denote the nucleon case .",
    "the various parameters for nucleon form factors are @xmath88 .",
    "the momentum space trinucleon wave functions @xcite are realistic wave functions derived from the faddeev equation ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) with different model potentials .",
    "each one of them has 22 channels which contain all possible states up to and including @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the total angular momentum of the subsystem particles .",
    "they can be written as , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the channel number and @xmath93 is the center of mass momentum of the trinucleon system which we will not write explicitly from now on .",
    "the coupling scheme of the channels is , @xmath94 the spin and angular momentum part is given by @xmath95 with @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) the angular momentum ( spin ) of subsystem @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) the angular momentum ( spin ) of particle @xmath76 ( the spectator particle ) .",
    "these are coupled to form @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) and then to @xmath103 .",
    "the @xmath104 is the isospin part , with @xmath105 being the subsystem isospin which couples with @xmath106 , the spectator isospin , to form @xmath107 .",
    "it is now clear that @xmath108 in eq .",
    "( [ iatoepm ] ) is just the @xmath109 projection of eq .",
    "( [ wavefunc ] ) @xmath110 where @xmath111 note that eq .",

    "their coupling method is exactly the same as the bipolar harmonic in eq .",
    "( [ bipolarhar ] ) .    to put @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ iatoepm ] ) into a useful format , we have to expand @xmath115 non - relativistically in powers of the struck nucleon momentum @xmath116 ( which equals @xmath81 upon setting the initial center of mass momentum of the trinucleon zero ) and the @xmath117 functions into angular momentum eigenstates . upon setting @xmath118 and denoting @xmath119",
    "the @xmath117 functions can be expanded as ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for definitions of spherical bessel functions @xmath120 ) , @xmath121 the notations used here are the same as brink and satchler @xcite except that the clebsch - gordon coefficients are denoted by @xmath122 as opposed to @xmath123 .",
    "the next thing after the expansion is to couple all the spin and angular momentum operators in eq .",
    "( [ iatoepm ] ) into tensors of rank 0 or 1 .",
    "since the total angular momentum of both initial and final states is @xmath8 , there is no need to couple the operators into tensor of other ranks .",
    "there is also no need to couple operators into odd parity quantities as both the initial and final states are of even parity . recognizing the total angular momentum of the trinucleon system in the ia as the spin in the epm",
    ", one can easily see that any operators of rank 1 in the ia correspond to ( within a factor ) @xmath124 matrices in the epm and operators of rank 0 in the ia correspond to identity hadronic operators in the epm .",
    "all the coefficients in @xmath115 are expanded to @xmath125 except that of @xmath3 .",
    "the kinematic endpoints of rmc are quite close to the poles of @xmath3 and thus might make its value large at those places .",
    "therefore , coefficients of @xmath3 are expanded to @xmath126 .    the correspondence between the ia and the epm for all forms of operators up to first order in momentum is shown below .",

    "<S> the rate of the nuclear reaction @xmath0 has been calculated using both the elementary particle model ( epm ) approach and the impulse approximation ( ia ) approach . </S>",
    "<S> using the epm approach , the exclusive statistical radiative muon capture ( rmc ) rate for photon energy greater than 57 mev is found to be @xmath1 and the ordinary muon capture ( omc ) rate to be @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the ia calculation exhibits a slight dependence on the type of trinucleon wave functions used . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the ia and epm calculation is larger for rmc than for omc . to resolve the difference between the two approaches </S>",
    "<S> a more detailed investigation including meson exchange corrections will be required . </S>"
