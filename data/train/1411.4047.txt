    "the growth of brown dwarf astronomy has closely mirrored that of exoplanetary astronomy .",
    "although @xcite discovered a likely brown dwarf candidate , the first confirmed detection of a brown dwarf was announced two months before the announcement of the first exoplanet orbiting a main sequence star @xcite .",
    "that same year also saw the discovery of the first brown dwarf orbiting a stellar - mass companion @xcite .",
    "today , more than 2,000 brown dwarfs have been discovered .",
    "the majority of these substellar objects have no detected companions , so characterization is often limited to spectroscopic observations . in these cases , the atmosphere of the brown dwarf can be extensively studied ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but its physical parameters , including mass and radius , can not be measured directly .",
    "when a brown dwarf with a gravitationally bound companion is detected , detailed characterization of its physical properties is possible . radial velocity ( rv )",
    "surveys have produced a significant number of brown dwarf candidates with minimum mass determinations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "astrometric monitoring of directly imaged brown dwarf companions to stars has led to dynamical mass measurements of brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "while there are many brown dwarfs with measured masses , radii can only be directly measured in transiting or eclipsing systems .",
    "the first eclipsing brown dwarf system , discovered by @xcite in the orion nebula , produced the first measurement of a brown dwarf s radius and the first test of theoretical mass - radius relations .",
    "today , there are eleven brown dwarfs with measured masses and radii @xcite . of this sample , eight transit a stellar - mass companion and only four are not inflated due to youth or irradiation . if the brown dwarf is assumed to be coeval with its host star , the brown dwarf s age and metallicity can be estimated .",
    "both properties are expected to affect the brown dwarf mass - radius relation , making observations of transiting brown dwarfs especially valuable @xcite .",
    "recently , four brown dwarfs have been detected by the _",
    "mission @xcite . launched in 2009 , the _ kepler _ telescope collected wide - field photometric observations of approximately 200,000 stars in cygnus and lyra every 30 minutes for 4 years @xcite .",
    "the mission was designed as a search for transiting planets . as brown dwarfs",
    "have radii similar to jupiter , brown dwarfs were also easily detected ; only a few rv observations are necessary to distinguish between a giant planet and brown dwarf companion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the first unambiguous brown dwarf detected from _ kepler _",
    "data was found in the lhs6343 system and announced by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter j11 ) .",
    "the authors analyzed five transits of the primary star observed in the first six weeks of _ kepler _ data , combined with one transit observed in the z - band with the nickel telescope at lick observatory and 14 rv observations with keck / hires .",
    "the authors also obtained pharo adaptive optics imaging data from the palomar 200 inch telescope , imaging a companion 0.5 magnitudes fainter than the primary at a separation of 07 . from these observations ,",
    "the authors were able to measure a mass for the brown dwarf of @xmath5 m@xmath1 , a radius of @xmath6 r@xmath1 , and a period of @xmath7 days , corresponding to a semimajor axis of @xmath8 au .",
    "the authors define lhs6343a as the primary star , lhs6343b as the widely - separated binary m dwarf , and lhs6343c as the brown dwarf orbiting the a component , and note the architecture of this system is very similar to the nltt41135 system discovered by @xcite .",
    "additional papers have expanded our knowledge of lhs6343 . @xcite",
    "re - fit the _ kepler _ light curve , using data through quarter 2 from the mission . by fitting the observations using five different sets of stellar models",
    ", he attempted to reduce biases caused by any one individual stellar model .",
    "he found different models provide a consistent brown dwarf radius at the @xmath9 r@xmath1 level , but found a higher mass than j11 : his best fitting mass for lhs6343c was @xmath10 m@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite analyzed the lack of transit timing variations in the system , finding that any additional companions to lhs6343a with an orbital period smaller than 100 days must have a mass smaller than that of jupiter . with 6 quarters of _ kepler _ data , @xcite measured a photometric rotation period of @xmath11 days for lhs6343a .",
    "the authors also claimed to observe spot - crossing events during the transits of lhs6343a , as well as out - of - transit photometric modulation with a period consistent with the orbital period of lhs6343c .",
    "@xcite updated this work , concluding that the out - of - transit variations are dominated by relativistic doppler beaming .    in many of the papers about the lhs6343 system after the discovery paper , the authors assumed the physical parameters of j11 .",
    "this is not necessarily an ideal assumption to make .",
    "j11 used a limited dataset during their analysis .",
    "their photometry consisted of only six transits and 14 rvs , and they estimated the third light contribution of lhs6343b by extrapolating from near - ir observations to the _ kepler _ bandpass .",
    "moreover , the derived stellar parameters in that paper were based only on photometric observations and depend strongly on the accuracy of the padova model grids @xcite upon which they are based .",
    "the conclusion of the primary _ kepler _ mission affords us an opportunity to reanalyze the lhs6343 system using the complete _ kepler _ dataset .",
    "such a reanalysis enables us to better measure the brown dwarf s mass and radius .",
    "there are only three non - inflated brown dwarfs with both a mass and radius measured to @xmath12 or better : lhs6343c , koi-205 b @xcite , and koi-415 b @xcite .",
    "to test theoretical brown dwarf evolutionary models , we would like to measure the masses , radii , and metallicities of these objects as precisely as possible . in this work ,",
    "we analyze the full _ kepler _ dataset for this object to measure the transit profile .",
    "we combine this light curve with additional rv observations , near - infrared spectroscopy of lhs6343ab , and robo - ao visible - light adaptive optics . without any reliance on stellar models beyond an empirical main sequence mass - radius relation ,",
    "we are able to measure the mass of lhs6343c to a precision of 3% and the radius to a precision of 2% .",
    "the mass and radius measurements depend only on the following parameters , all measured directly from the data : the orbital period , stellar density @xmath13 , reduced semimajor axis @xmath14@xmath15 , doppler semiamplitude @xmath16 , eccentricity , and inclination .",
    "our technique allows one to calculate the mass and radius for both members of a transiting system .",
    "we also combine our data with the predictions for the mass of lhs6343a from the dartmouth stellar evolutionary models of @xcite .",
    "these combined data enable us to measure a model - dependent mass and radius of lhs6343c to better than @xmath17 each ; we also measure a metallicity of the system of @xmath18 dex .    in",
    "we describe the observations used in this paper . in",

    ", we derive the relation between transit and rv parameters and the mass and radius of both the primary and secondary companion .",
    "this study presents , to date , the most precise mass and radius measurements of a non - inflated brown dwarf .",
    "observations such as these are essential for future detailed characterization of field brown dwarfs .",
    "the lhs6343 system ( kic 10002261 , koi-959 ) was part of the initial _ kepler _ target selection and was observed during all observing quarters in long cadence mode . between 22 february 2011 and 14 march 2011 ,",
    "the system was also observed using _",
    "kepler _ s short cadence mode , with observations collected every 58.84876 seconds in the reference frame of the spacecraft .",
    "we downloaded the entire dataset from the nasa multimission archive at stsci ( mast ) .    for both long and short cadence observations , _ kepler",
    "_ data consist of a postage stamp containing tens of pixels , a small number of which are combined to form an effective aperture .",
    "the flux from all pixels in the aperture are combined to create a light curve .",
    "the _ kepler _ team defines an aperture for all targets and performs aperture photometry as a part of their photometric analysis ( pa ) pipeline , which produces a light curve from the pixel - level data @xcite .",
    "this pipeline also removes the photometric background and cosmic rays .    in analyzing the pipeline - generated light curve",
    ", we detected occasional anomalies during transit events , with the recorded flux systematically larger than expected .",
    "these anomalies were also detected by @xcite , who attribute them to occultations of spots on lhs6343a by lhs6343c .",
    "the anomalies occur only in the long cadence data , and only when the transit is symmetric around one data point in the _ kepler _ time series , so that the central in - transit flux measurement would be expected to be significantly lower than the surrounding data points . by investigating the pixel - level data",
    ", we find that each anomaly has been registered as a cosmic ray by the pa pipeline , and `` corrected '' to an artificially large value .",
    "using the pixel - level data , recorded before the cosmic ray correction in the pipeline , we removed these artificial corrections .",
    "we find the anomalies can be completely explained as false cosmic ray detections : there is no evidence for transit - to - transit variability in the _ kepler _ data .",
    "we expect stellar granulation to induce correlated photometric variability only at a level significantly below the precision of our observations .",
    "correlated noise attributed to stellar granulation has been previously observed when modeling transits of companions to higher mass stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and used to derive fundamental parameters of the stars themselves @xcite .",
    "both the timescale and magnitude of the correlated noise are inversely proportional to the stellar density @xcite . for an m dwarf with a mass around 0.3m@xmath19 , we expect granulation to induce correlated noise with a period of approximately 10 seconds and an amplitude of 50 ppm @xcite",
    ". therefore , given the precision and cadence of the _ kepler _ observations we do not expect to observe correlated noise due to granulation in the lhs6343 system .",
    "we tested for correlated noise on transit timescales by calculating the autocorrelation matrix for out - of - transit sections of the data . for both long cadence and short cadence data ,",
    "all off - diagonal elements have absolute values less than 0.03 ; we found no periodic structure to the autocorrelation matrix .",
    "therefore , on transit timescales the noise can be treated as white .",
    "we converted all times recorded by _",
    "kepler _ to barycentric dynamical time ( tdb ) , not utc , which was mistakenly recorded during the first three years of the mission . as a result ,",
    "our times differ from those reported in the analysis of j11 by 66.184 seconds .",
    "we then detrended the light curve to remove the effects of stellar and instrumental variability .",
    "for all transit events with at least four data points recorded continuously before and after the transit , we selected a region bounded by a maximum of three transit durations on either side of the nominal transit center",
    ". if there is any spacecraft motion , such as a thruster fire or data downlink , we clipped the fitting region to not include these data .",
    "we then fit a second - order polynomial to the out of transit flux .",
    "we normalized the light curve by dividing the observed flux values by the calculated polynomial .",
    "we repeated this procedure near the midpoint between successive transits in order to search for evidence of a secondary eclipse .",
    "we estimated the noise level in the data by measuring the variance observed in the out of transit segments of the data .",
    "we obtained spectroscopic observations of lhs6343 using the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires , @xmath20,000 ) at the w. m. keck observatory .",
    "all observations were taken using the c2 decker . with a projected length of 14.0 arcsec ,",
    "the decker enables accurate sky subtraction .",
    "the first four observations were obtained using a 45 minute exposure time and the standard iodine - cell setup described by @xcite . once lhs6343c was identified as an transiting brown dwarf",
    ", the remaining observations were obtained with 3 minute exposure times and without the iodine cell . for all observations ,",
    "the slit was aligned along the binary axis so that light from both stars fell upon the detector .    to measure the rv of lhs6343a , we used lhs6343b as a wavelength reference .",
    "we began with an iodine - free spectrum of hip 428 , oversampled onto a grid with resolution 15 m s@xmath21 .",
    "for each observation , we restricted our analysis to the 16 orders covered by the `` green '' ccd chip , which covers the region typically used in iodine cell analyses , as well as the first two orders covered by the `` red '' chip where telluric contamination is negligible . from these 18 orders",
    ", we first estimated and divided out the continuum flux level following the method of @xcite .",
    "we then removed the regions of the spectrum contaminated by telluric lines .",
    "we added to this template a shifted , scaled version of itself to represent lhs6343b .",
    "we varied the positions of both stars and compared to the observed spectrum of lhs6343 in order to find the maximum likelihood velocity separation between the two stars . by assuming the relative rv of lhs6343b does not change over our observing baseline , our method enables us to measure",
    "the rv of lhs6343a relative to that of a stationary wavelength calibration source observed simultaneously .    there is no evidence of orbital motion of lhs6343b at the level of our rv precision . from an",
    "observed projected separation and mass estimate we can estimate the maximum expected rv acceleration induced by a companion .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , the maximum rv acceleration is defined such that @xmath22 for a system at a distance @xmath23 , with a companion with mass @xmath24 at an angular separation @xmath25 . for a companion with a mass approximately 30% of the sun s and a projected separation ( @xmath26 ) of approximately 20 au",
    ", we expect a maximum rv acceleration of 40 m s@xmath21 yr@xmath21 .",
    "we would only observe this rv acceleration if we happened to observe the two stars at the time of their maximum orbital separation and if their orbit was edge - on to our line of sight .",
    "our rv signal is considerably larger than any effects induced by lhs6343b ; any rv acceleration over our three - year baseline is similar in size to our measurement uncertainties .    the median rv precision of our observations is 85 m s@xmath21 .",
    "our rv precision is much lower ( @xmath27 m s@xmath21 ) for the first four observations when the spectra are contaminated by the iodine cell .",

    "part of this discrepancy may be due to the choice of models used : these authors used the padova model grids of @xcite .",

    ", the authors of the discovery paper adopted a slightly smaller log(g ) , which for a given mass implies a larger star , and therefore a larger planet .",
    "the discrepancy may also be affected by our choices of limb darkening models : the authors of the discovery paper use a quadratic limb darkening model . with",
    "only five transits observed , this is a reasonable choice .",
    "given the signal to noise obtained from fitting four years of _ kepler _ data simultaneously , we require a four - parameter limb darkening solution to develop an appropriate model fit .    our mean density for lhs6343c is 40% larger than that reported in the discovery paper .",
    "this appears to be because the authors of that paper misreported their density , as it is inconsistent with their reported mass and radius .",
    "these authors may have reported the density relative to jupiter , not in units of g cc@xmath21 as listed in their table 5 . even with this correction , the density we report is larger than the density of j11 due to the difference in the radius of the brown dwarf described in the previous paragraph .",

    "a similar result is found in the gl 417 bc system @xcite . as these are the only two brown dwarf systems with reliable measurements of both mass and age , this result is suggestive of a fundamental issue with substellar models .",
    "we have only a lower limit on the age of the system : j11 find no youth indicators present in the lhs6343 system so it is likely not less than 1 - 2 gyr old .",

    "there is a degeneracy between the inferred age of the system and the atmosphere of the brown dwarf .",
    "specifically , a brown dwarf with the mass and radius of lhs6343c would be expected to be significantly older if it were covered with optically - thick clouds , as the clouds would keep the brown dwarf at a hotter internal adiabat .",
    "the models of @xcite , which do not include clouds , suggest an age of approximately 5 gyr , consistent with the cloudless models of @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite predict a cloudy brown dwarf with a mass of lhs6343c and an age equal to the age of the universe would have a radius @xmath84 larger than that observed for this object .",
    "this is consistent with the models of @xcite , who find the system must be very old if lhs6343c has a thick layer of clouds .",
    "these authors claim thinner clouds or no clouds may be preferred by the data .",
    "therefore , any additional observations which suggest the presence of clouds on lhs6343c would be at odds with the predictions from theoretical brown dwarf model atmospheres .",
    "the luminosity of lhs6343c can be measured by observing its secondary eclipses as it passes behind lhs6343a . in the _ kepler _ bandpass",

    "in addition to probing for extreme variability caused by patchy clouds in the atmosphere of lhs6343c , combining these observations with the _ kepler _ secondary and ground - based jhk photometry will enable us to measure a luminosity of this brown dwarf from the visible to the mid - infrared .",

    "following @xcite , the transit light curve enables a direct measurement of the stellar density @xmath13 and the reduced semimajor axis and the stellar radius , @xmath14@xmath15 . from these , the authors claim if the stellar mass - radius relation is known , then the stellar mass can be measured directly from the light curve .",
    "we show if the doppler semiamplitude @xmath16 is known , the stellar mass can be measured exactly .",
    "we know from kepler s third law that , for two orbiting bodies with masses @xmath120 and @xmath121 ( by convention , @xmath120@xmath122 ) and orbital period @xmath85 , that @xmath123 where @xmath124 is newton s constant . the mean stellar density is defined for a star of mass @xmath120 and radius @xmath15 to be @xmath125      famously , the doppler semiamplitude @xmath16 observed in a radial velocity survey is @xmath127 here , @xmath30 is the orbital inclination and @xmath128 the eccentricity , while all other variables retain their previous meaning . rearranging this equation",
    ", we can once again write the mass ratio in terms of observable parameters only . in this case , @xmath129            therefore , by measuring the stellar density , reduced semimajor axis , orbital period , transit depth , inclination , eccentricity , and doppler semiamplitude , we can measure the stellar and planetary mass and radius . moreover , since the companion is transiting , we know @xmath135 .",
    "@xcite present equations for the physical parameters above in terms of parameters directly observable from the light curve . specifically , they find , in the limit of @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 ^ 3 \\bigg(\\frac{3p}{g\\pi^2}\\bigg)\\bigg(\\frac{\\sqrt{1-e^2}}{(1+e \\sin w)}\\bigg)^3.\\ ] ] here , @xmath139 is the fractional transit depth , or the relative areas of the transiting companion and the host star .",
    "@xmath140 is the transit duration from first to fourth contact ( including ingress and egress ) , and @xmath141 is the transit duration from second to third contact ( excluding ingress and egress ) .",
    "if we substitute these into our above equations for the stellar mass and radius , we find our expressions for the mass and radius are undefined .",
    "specifically , our denominator , @xmath142 is undefined at @xmath143 .",
    "our equations above work specifically in the case where the mass of the companion is not negligible .",
    "this is because the stellar density can not be measured exactly from the light curve alone .",
    "while often neglected in exoplanet studies , the true observable is @xmath144 . in cases where the mass ratio is large , this value approaches @xmath145 , enabling the stellar density to be approximated well . for the case of a jupiter - sized",
    "planet transiting a sun - like star , such an approximation is reasonable .",
    "however , this approximation breaks down for small mass ratios . in this case",
    ", an additional constraint is required .",
    "an additional constraint can be provided by using the mass ratio , which can be measured by observing ellipsoidal variations in the full phase curve @xcite .",
    "ellipsoidal variations have been used both to confirm transiting planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and to measure the mass ratios of already - confirmed planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by including such an observation ,",
    "the degeneracy between the stellar density and mass ratio can be broken and the stellar mass measured directly .",
    "when both the mass ratio is small and ellipsoidal variations can not be observed from the light curve , the masses can still be measured directly if the star can be assumed to fall on the main sequence , as outlined by @xcite . for a fixed transit depth , reduced semimajor axis , and doppler semiamplitude ,",
    "a star s inferred mass is related to the star s predicted radius such that @xmath146 , with the exact coefficient depending on the host - companion mass ratio ( and approaching 3 as the mass ratio becomes infinite ) . since the stellar main - sequence has a significantly different mass - radius relation , this information can be used to rule out many unphysical transit models .",
    "an example of this is shown as fig .",
    "[ m - r ] .        because a nonzero mass ratio is required ,",
    "this method is likely only applicable when the companion is a hot jupiter , transiting brown dwarf , or low - mass stellar companion .",
    "moreover , it requires precise knowledge of both the doppler semiamplitude and transit parameters .",
    "therefore , the potential of this method is likely limited at present to hot transiting companions orbiting bright host stars . yet for these cases this technique may be very useful , especially when stellar evolutionary models may have systematic errors , such as when the host is an m dwarf or subgiant star ."
