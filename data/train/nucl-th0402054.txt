    "during the past decade methods of effective field theory ( eft ) have been developed for problems of interest to low - energy nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "the underlying idea is based on the separation of scales .",
    "if a problem has widely disparate scales and one is interested in low - energy phenomena , then the details of the short - distance physics are unimportant all that matters is its effects on the long - range phenomena .",
    "formally , eft replaces these short - distance interactions with contact interactions containing an arbitrary number of derivatives .",
    "power counting justifies truncating the interaction lagrangian and allows an _ a priori _ estimate of errors at a given order .",
    "an archetypical example of a pure eft treatment of relevance in nuclear and molecular physics is the eft of short - range forces @xcite .",
    "this formalism is useful when the low - energy two - body cross section is much larger than what is expected based on the underlying scales .",
    "when as in the two - nucleon system there is a shallow real or virtual bound state , there is also a large scale separation between the scattering length and all other scales in the problem .",
    "a power counting then requires that the lowest - order contact interaction be iterated to all orders while other effects can be treated perturbatively @xcite .",
    "ultimately , as far as two - body scattering is concerned , this approach essentially reproduces the effective range expansion @xcite .",
    "the true power of the method becomes clear when more bodies and/or external probes ( _ e.g _ , electroweak currents ) are coupled to the two - body system @xcite . for example , recent success has been achieved in the systematic description of three - nucleon systems @xcite , and promising avenues exist for the exploration of many - nucleon systems ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    the purpose of the present paper is to develop an eft treatment for the nonrelativistic two - body scattering problems that have more that one open channel with different thresholds .",
    "the scattering in both channels can be treated as being unnaturally large at low energy .",
    "our purpose in developing this expansion is partly formal : the renormalization of such a problem is characteristically different from that in the single - channel case , and it is interesting to construct explicitly the renormalized amplitudes .",
    "in addition , our analysis may be of practical use in a few specialized cases of nucleon - nucleus scattering .",
    "finally , it provides some insight into eft treatments of a very general class of problems of importance to both nuclear and hadronic physics , namely , the scattering of two bodies when there are open channels even at zero kinetic energy .",
    "to set up the problem consider a case of a nucleon @xmath3 scattering off of a nucleus @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that the nucleus has a low - lying excited state @xmath5 with the excitation energy much smaller than a typical scale of the interaction between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , the system has an unnaturally - large cross section at low energy .",
    "the scattering reaction of a nucleon @xmath3 off a nucleus @xmath4 has two channels : @xmath6 channel @xmath7 corresponds to an elastic , and channel @xmath8 to an inelastic scattering . we assume for simplicity that the scattering in both channels occurs in an @xmath9 wave in a singlet spin and isospin state .",
    "however , we allow the outgoing nucleon in channel ii to be in a different state , in order to explicitly account for different charge states .    the formal development of this theory is designed to closely follow the case of the pionless eft and as such may be viewed as a generalization of the effective range expansion .",
    "however , the kinematics is quite different in the present case and the generalized effective range expansion will be qualitatively different from the usual one in the case of a single channel .",
    "formally , we develop an effective field theory which is valid for the case where there are two unnaturally - light scales in the problem",
    ". one of them is the threshold of the second channel of the scattering reaction .",
    "this threshold is given by the excitation energy of @xmath5 , @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the masses of the nucleus @xmath4 , its excited state @xmath5 and the two nucleon states , respectively .",
    "the present treatment is applicable when @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the typical scale describing the underlying interactions of short range @xmath17 , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the reduced masses for the @xmath20 and @xmath21 systems , respectively .",
    "we want to study the scattering at an energy @xmath22 comparable to @xmath23 .",
    "we take the scattering cross section at such low energy to be very large compared to @xmath24 .",
    "the second unnaturally small quantity is the inverse scattering length , which generates the very large scattering cross section .    as in a single - channel scattering",
    ", observables are obtained from the on - shell @xmath25-matrix ( or the physical scattering amplitude ) .",
    "the @xmath25-matrix for the scattering with two open channels has a form of a two - by - two square matrix .",
    "diagonal entries of this matrix describe elastic scattering while the two off - diagonal entries correspond to the inelastic reactions .",
    "the scattering is considered here in the center - of - mass frame of the initial @xmath26 system .    in close analogy to single - channel scattering",
    "the coupled - channel @xmath25-matrix is a solution of a lippmann - schwinger - like equation ,    @xmath27    where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the relative momenta of the initial and final particles in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "the interaction potential @xmath30 , and the coupled - channel two - body non - relativistic green function are two - by - two matrices .",
    "the latter is a diagonal matrix ; neglecting terms of higher order in momenta over large masses , @xmath31 where @xmath23 is the kinematical threshold for the channel @xmath8 defined in eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) .",
    "note that in the present regime the threshold @xmath23 is positive ",
    "channel @xmath8 is energetically above channel @xmath7 . in section",
    "[ optical ] we will consider a case when @xmath23 is negative ",
    "channel @xmath8 is below channel @xmath7 .",
    "the diagonal elements of @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , describe off - shell propagation of @xmath26 and @xmath35 systems , respectively .",
    "these green functions can be obtained from the non - interacting part of the total lagrange density , @xmath36    where the field @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) creates ( destroys ) a particle of type @xmath39 .",
    "the ellipsis in eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) stand for the relativistic corrections .",
    "( [ l ] ) gives eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) apart from higher - order terms , since in leading order @xmath40 .    to obtain the @xmath25-matrix from eq .",
    "( [ ls ] ) we need to know the form of the coupled - channel interaction potential @xmath41 .",
    "it describes the interactions between the incoming nucleon @xmath3 and the nucleons inside the nucleus @xmath4 . in general",
    ", this is a many - body problem .",
    "however , as long as the kinetic energy is small so that the wavelength of the nucleon @xmath3 is much larger than the range of the interaction , the effects of this interaction on the low - energy scattering observables can be represented by contact interactions between a nucleon and the nucleus as a whole .",
    "since the threshold @xmath23 is of order of the kinetic energy @xmath22 , each nuclear state has to be considered as an explicit degree of freedom .",
    "the effective potential , @xmath42 , is given by an infinite sum of contact interactions , which in momentum space has the form @xmath43 where ellipsis stand for terms with higher powers of momenta .- wave scattering are shown . ] the constant coefficients @xmath44 , @xmath45 , _ etc .",
    "_ , are two - by - two matrices . for example , @xmath46    the potential in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) can be obtained from the most general lagrangian satisfying lorentz , parity and time - reversal invariance .",
    "the interaction part of the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) is    @xmath47    where the last term represents the coupling between the two channels , and the ellipsis stand for terms containing derivatives .    the existence of an infinite number of singular interactions in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) requires one to introduce a power counting , which justifies a truncation in the number of interaction terms that must be kept up to a given order in an expansion in powers of @xmath48 .",
    "in addition , as in any field theory , a renormalization scheme is necessary to relate parameters in the lagrangian to observables , and render the latter independent of the cutoff .    in the case of a single - channel scattering at low energies with short - range forces , this situation has been thoroughly investigated and a well - defined eft exists @xcite .",
    "the power - counting scheme depends on whether the scattering length is natural or unnatural ; in the latter case , it relies on the fact that other scattering observables , such as effective range and shape terms in the effective range expansion , are natural , as one would naively expect when the underlying interactions are short ranged .",
    "the large scattering length usually indicates the presence of a shallow real or virtual bound state . in this case an @xmath9-wave @xmath25-matrix at leading order is obtained by iterating ( via the lippmann - schwinger equation ) the interaction potential that is given by a momentum - independent contact interaction containing a single constant @xmath49 @xcite . in this iteration , any regularization and renormalization scheme",
    "can be used : momentum cutoff , dimensional regularization with power - divergence subtraction , _ etc .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "as it will become clear below , it is possible to define a power counting in the coupled - channel case in a similar way .",
    "however , the power counting in the present case has to reflect the existence of two unnaturally small scales , namely the large scattering cross sections and the small threshold @xmath23 .    in this work , the infinite momentum integrals appearing in eq .",
    "( [ ls ] ) will be regularized using a sharp momentum cutoff @xmath2 ; however , the final results are independent of the regularization procedure . as in a single - channel case with unnatural scattering length",
    ", we expect that at leading order the coupled - channel @xmath25-matrix is obtained by iterating the first term in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) the constant matrix @xmath50 .",
    "the rest of the terms are expected to be treated perturbatively according to the mass dimension of the constants @xmath51 .",
    "note that while such a power counting seems to be a quite logical generalization of the power counting in the single - channel case , it is not totally obvious how to implement the renormalization for the present case .",
    "one principal result of this paper is to demonstrate how this can be accomplished .",
    "the success of the power counting for single - channel scattering is ultimately connected to an ability to `` fine tune '' one `` bare '' constant @xmath52 such as to reproduce the scattering length @xmath53 , which can be much larger than the typical scale @xmath54 of the underlying short - range interactions .",
    "the single - channel @xmath9-wave @xmath25-matrix at leading order has the following form ( in the center - of - mass frame of two particles with reduced mass @xmath55 and the initial relative momentum @xmath28 ) @xcite :    @xmath56    the right - hand side of eq .",

    "we see that the eft reproduces the standard multi - channel generalization of the effective range expansion @xcite .",
    "as expected , the existence of the low - energy threshold ( given by @xmath23 ) for the second reaction channel ( channel @xmath8 ) modifies the scattering in the initial channel channel @xmath7 .",
    "even though eq .",
    "( [ tsinvlimit ] ) is an obvious generalization of the single - channel case , it has some noteworthy features .    when the kinetic energy @xmath81 , channel @xmath8 is closed .",
    "thus , we expect that the expansion of @xmath82 ( describing the scattering in channel @xmath7 ) in powers of the relative momentum @xmath28 takes the same form as the effective range expansion in the single - channel case , eq .",

    "the same is true for other effective range parameters . from the perspective of channel @xmath7 alone ,",
    "all effective range parameters are large .",
    "the off - diagonal elements of the coupled - channel @xmath25-matrix , eq .",
    "( [ tt ] ) , are not identically zero even for the case when @xmath81 .",
    "this , however , does not mean that there is a non - zero cross section for the scattering into channel @xmath8 .",
    "the reason is that the asymptotic wave function in channel @xmath8 is , up to a constant , @xmath91 which gives zero contribution to the outgoing flux when @xmath92 and , as a result , the scattering into this channel has zero cross section .    as the energy @xmath22 increases and approaches the kinematical threshold for channel @xmath8 from below , the @xmath93 s in eq .",

    "optical potentials potentials with real and imaginary parts are usually introduced to describe scattering in which the flux in the sector explicitly considered is not conserved .",
    "this occurs when there are open channels that are not explicitly described by the theory .",
    "a well - known example in hadronic physics is @xmath103 annihilation at low energies @xcite .",
    "it is clearly of interest to develop an effective - field - theory treatment for such cases .",
    "presumably , the generic logic underlying eft s power counting applies .",
    "the subtle issue concerns whether one can integrate out a channel that is separated by a large mass scale but is open , that is , represents asymptotic states that are accessible even at low energy .",
    "certainly , if one does this one can no longer impose unitarity .",
    "thus it is plausible that the form of an eft in such a regime would be that of a usual eft with usual power counting but with complex coefficients .",
    "we also expect that the result would be an expansion analogous to the effective range expansion , with complex parameters ; indeed , such expansion already exists @xcite .",
    "if this can be established , then the eft approach can be usefully extended to a wide array of new systems .    one way to test",
    "this idea is in the context of a solvable model .",

    "assume furthermore that @xmath104 is large compared to the other low scales in the problem ( @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) but remains small compared to the underlying scale @xmath87 , which justifies the treatment in the previous section .",
    "in this case we have a simple example of such an eft and we can test how it works .    to see how the coupled - channel calculation goes with these kinematics ,",
    "we only need to slightly modify the treatment . in section  [ cch ]",
    "we discussed an eft treatment of the low - energy scattering with two open channels for which the threshold @xmath23 was positive so that the coupled channel was above the initial channel channel @xmath7 . yet , the treatment is valid also when the second channel is below the initial channel .",
    "in fact the form of the @xmath25-matrix in eq .",
    "( [ tt ] ) is the same with just a single difference the threshold @xmath23 is negative .",
    "the renormalization is not affected by this change .",
    "thus the scattering in channel @xmath7 is given by @xmath82 , eq .",
    "( [ tt ] ) . while channel @xmath8 is now open for any non - zero initial energy , @xmath82 can still be expanded in powers of @xmath107 when @xmath108 .",

    "( [ efr2 ] ) has the form of the effective range expansion with complex coefficients that reflect the scales in the problem .",
    "while the effective scattering length is approximately real and large , @xmath111 , the effective range is approximately imaginary and small , @xmath112 .",
    "we expect , therefore , that the eft developed here can be generalized to describe other problems with open channels well below the scale explicitly included in the eft .",
    "it remains an open question how relevant such a treatment would be for @xmath113 scattering at low energy .",
    "the obvious complication is the presence of many open channels containing mesons in the final states .",

    "as far as the eft description of @xmath114 and @xmath115 channels is concerned , the rest of the channels can perhaps be described by a single effective channel separated by a threshold @xmath23 .",

    "<S> the problem of describing low - energy two - body scattering for systems with two open channels with different thresholds is addressed in the context of an effective field theory . in particular , the problem where the threshold is unnaturally small and the cross section at low energy is unnaturally large is considered . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the lowest - order point coupling associated with the mixing of the channels scales as @xmath0 rather than @xmath1 ( the scaling of the same - channel coupling and the scaling in a single - channel case ) where @xmath2 is the ultraviolet cutoff . </S>",

    "<S> the treatment of higher orders is straightforward . </S>",
