    "the existence of light hypernuclei , such as @xmath12he , shows the low energy @xmath13-@xmath14 interaction to be strongly attractive , though not sufficient to bind the two - baryon hyperdeuteron .",
    "the @xmath13-@xmath14 interaction is of especial interest since it is influenced by the strange quark content of the @xmath13-hyperon .",
    "however , in contrast to the nucleon - nucleon case , due to the short lifetime of the @xmath13 , direct measurements of low - energy @xmath13-@xmath14 scattering are sparse and the resulting parameters rather poorly known .",
    "bubble chamber measurements @xcite , based on samples of a few hundred secondary events , have allowed determinations of the elastic cross section down to @xmath13 laboratory momenta @xmath15  mev / c . in the low energy region , where only @xmath16-waves are important , the spin - averaged total cross section is of the form @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the @xmath0 centre - of - mass momentum and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are , respectively ,",
    "the @xmath16-wave scattering lengths and effective ranges in the @xmath0 spin - singlet and triplet states . separate values of these parameters have been claimed for the two spin states @xcite and these are shown in fig .",
    "[ ar_other ] . however , the error bars are large , strongly and systematically correlated and hard to quantify , since such data should really only support the determination of an average scattering length @xmath21 and effective range @xmath22 @xcite . already for laboratory momenta @xmath23  mev / c ,",
    "the differential cross section is significantly non - isotropic , indicating the presence of @xmath24 or higher waves @xcite , and so it is not surprising that the @xmath16-wave parameters deduced from such experiments depend upon the upper momentum cut assumed .",
    "values of the scattering length and effective range have also been deduced through the study of the @xmath0 final state interaction ( fsi ) in the @xmath25 reaction with stopped @xmath26-mesons @xcite .",
    "here it is the of the @xmath0 effective mass spectrum near the kinematic limit which is sensitive to the parameters . in impulse approximation",
    "the amplitude for this process is proportional to that for @xmath27 and , if the fermi motion in the target deuteron is neglected , the reaction is purely @xmath28-wave with no spin - flip .",
    "the final @xmath0 system is therefore in the same spin - triplet state as the @xmath29 pair in the deuteron and the values @xmath30 and @xmath31 so determined , which are also shown in fig .",
    "[ ar_other ] , are consistent with those obtained from the scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "phenomenological investigations of the @xmath0 interaction by the jlich  @xcite and nijmegen  @xcite groups yield low energy scattering parameters in agreement with the results of fig .",
    "[ ar_other ] , though it is impossible to quantify the systematic uncertainties inherent in such models .",
    "it should , however , be noted that their spin - singlet potential is more attractive than the triplet , which is necessary to ensure the correct spin assignments of the ground states of @xmath12h and @xmath32he @xcite .",
    "the final state interaction in the @xmath33 reaction at low @xmath0 effective masses is also sensitive to the @xmath0 scattering parameters @xcite .",
    "the recent data on this reaction very close to threshold  @xcite , taken at the cosy-11 magnetic spectrometer @xcite installed at the cooler synchrotron cosy - jlich  @xcite , allow us to extract information complementary to that obtained from elastic scattering because it is possible to reach lower centre - of - mass momenta .    in the present paper we aim to constrain the @xmath0 scattering parameters from the of the double - differential @xmath33 cross section . in section  2 a simplified model is outlined to describe the principal interactions between the three outgoing particles .",

    "the fsi model was already used in ref .",
    "@xcite to determine the precise beam energy by fitting the integrated total cross sections as a function of beam energy with assumed values of the @xmath0 input parameters . to avoid biassing the analysis , in the present work we determine the @xmath0 parameters using only the structure of the dalitz plot at each energy and not its normalisation .",
    "for this purpose we apply the maximum likelihood method to obtain a map of the confidence levels for the @xmath0 scattering parameters .",
    "this formalism and the definition of the event weights are shown in section  4 . even taking the @xmath0 spin - triplet and singlet to be identical ,",
    "the resulting values of the average scattering length and effective range presented in section  5 are strongly and systematically correlated in the fit , such that it is hard to quote error bars .",
    "however , the position of the nearby pole in the @xmath0 scattering amplitude , corresponding to a virtual bound state of the system , is much more stable , being unbound by @xmath34  mev .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 6 .",
    "as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , if the basic production mechanism is of short range then the energy dependence of the @xmath1 cross section close to threshold is dominated by the available three - body phase - space @xmath35 , modified by final - state interactions . in principle",
    "one should consider fsi s in all the three two - body subsystems , , , and . since the strong interaction in the first case appears to be more than an order of magnitude larger than for the other two @xcite , we concentrate on the dominant factor @xmath36 in the @xmath13-@xmath14 system . in addition , however , the coulomb repulsion in the proton - kaon subsystem @xmath37 , where @xmath38 denotes the c.m .",
    "momentum in @xmath39 subsystem , is also important at the low energies pertaining in our experiment .",
    "keeping only these two interactions our _ ansatz _ for the production cross section is @xmath40 the @xmath16-wave assumption implicit here is justified for our experiment since , for excess energies @xmath41  mev , the maximum momentum in any two - body subsystem is below 100  mev / c .",
    "it should be noted that the bubble chamber data @xcite cover a higher range of @xmath13-@xmath14 momenta .",

    "it is worth noting that our production data are sensitive to much lower values of @xmath60 , as indicated by the arrow , than the scattering data , and it is this region which determines best the value of @xmath97 and hence the position of the pole of the virtual bound state .",
    "through an analysis of the two - dimensional structure of the dalitz plot for the @xmath107 reaction at fixed energies within a simple final - state - interaction model , we have established a strong constraint between the spin - averaged @xmath0 scattering length and effective range .",
    "the data allow us to fit accurately the position of the spin - average virtual bound state @xmath97 . since the data were taken at excess energies which are inaccessible to low energy elastic scattering experiments , the results are complementary and it is appropriate to make a combined fit of the whole data set , leading to new values of @xmath62 .    the total cross section data of ref .",
    "@xcite have recently been analysed to determine values of @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "their argument is , however , somewhat cyclic since a final - state interaction with fixed scattering length and effective range was already used in the experimental analysis to fix the beam energy @xcite . in principle",
    "therefore these values should then be found by the fitting procedure , though there are still of course the ambiguities discussed in this paper .",
    "we avoid falling into this trap by not using the relative normalisation of the event rate as a function of the beam energy within our fitting procedure .",
    "it is rather the structure of the two - dimensional dalitz plots which fixes our parameter values .",
    "though we have implicitly assumed that the @xmath0 system produced from the near - threshold @xmath108 reaction is the same 3:1 spin - average seen in bubble chamber scattering experiments , this is not guaranteed .",
    "just as in the @xmath109-capture experiment @xcite , the basic reaction mechanism could favour the production of a particular spin combination in the final state .",
    "if the present experiment were extended through the use of a polarised beam and target , then it would be possible to repeat the current analysis separately in the singlet and triplet final states to separate these important quantities .",
