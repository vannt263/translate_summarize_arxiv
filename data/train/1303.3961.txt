    "this model was first considered in @xcite , and a similar model was discussed in @xcite .",

    "our main result is that these events are positively correlated for the complete graph and for two natural models of random graphs .",

    "the events @xmath0 and @xmath14 can be shown to have positive correlation for any vertices in any graph @xmath11 .",
    "in @xcite it was proven , somewhat surprisingly , that also the events @xmath0 and @xmath15 have positive correlation in @xmath16 , when @xmath17 , but negative correlation if @xmath11 is a tree or a cycle .",
    "further , in @xcite it was shown that in the random graph models @xmath10 and @xmath18 for a fixed probability @xmath8 ( @xmath19 and large enough @xmath6 the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath15 is negative if @xmath8 is below a critical value and positive if @xmath8 is above the critical value .",

    "we conjecture that it is in fact non - negative for all pairs @xmath22 .    for technical reasons we will study the complementary events @xmath23 the event that no directed path from @xmath24 to @xmath25 exists , and @xmath26 .",
    "note that the events @xmath27 and @xmath28 have the same covariance as the events @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ corrkn ]",
    "we present a lower bound for @xmath29 and prove that @xmath27 and @xmath28 are positively correlated for @xmath30 an intuitive explanation is due to the fact that the biggest terms of @xmath31 comes from when no edges are directed from @xmath24 and when no edges are directed to @xmath32 analogously for @xmath33 we also show that the relative covariance of the two events converges to @xmath34 as @xmath35 in section [ gnp ] we consider the random graph @xmath3 on @xmath6 vertices .",
    "it is a random graph model in which every edge exists with probability @xmath8 independently of each other and then every existing edge is directed in either of the two directions with the same probability independently of all other edges .",
    "note that the two random prosesses can be combined in two different ways . in this paper",
    "we study the joined probability space of @xmath3 and that of egde orientations , which we call @xmath36 .",
    "this will be refered to as the annealed version .",
    "the other possibility , the quenched version , will be briefly discussed in section [ quenched ] .",
    "we prove that for fixed @xmath5 and sufficiently large @xmath6 the events @xmath27 and @xmath28 will be positively correlated in @xmath37    in section [ gnm ] we study the random graph model @xmath18 , with uniform distribution among all graphs with @xmath6 vertices and @xmath38 edges .",
    "note that in this graph the edges does not exist independently of each other since the number of edges in the graph is fixed . as before every existing edge",
    "is directed in either way with equal probability independent of all other edges .",
    "we prove that for fixed @xmath39the events @xmath27 and @xmath28 are positively correlated for sufficiently large @xmath6 .",
    "in section [ s : rec ] we give an exact recursion to compute @xmath29 in @xmath10 which supports our conjecture that the correlation is positive for all values of @xmath6 and @xmath8 .",
    "the problems studied here was first motivated by the , so far in vain , attempts to prove the so called bunkbed conjecture , see @xcite .",
    "to show that the correlation between @xmath27 and @xmath28 is positive we need a sufficient upperbound for @xmath31 ( and @xmath40 ) and a lower bound for @xmath41 both an upper bound and a lower bound for @xmath31 was given in @xcite :    [ sl ] for all @xmath42 , @xmath43    the next lemma gives a lowerbound for the probability of the event @xmath44    [ lowerb ] for all @xmath45 , @xmath46    define @xmath47 to be the set of points in @xmath48\\backslash \\{a , b\\}$ ] that can reach @xmath25 or @xmath49 in one step , that is with a single edge directed to @xmath25 or @xmath49 .",
