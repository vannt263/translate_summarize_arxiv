    "an example of a sterile neutrino model is the neutrino minimal standard model that adds to the sm three massive gauge - singlet fermions ( sterile neutrinos ) @xcite . in the context of this model , a search for extra peaks in the @xmath0 decay spectrum is sensitive to sterile neutrinos depending on the mass hierarchy structure and choice of parameters @xcite .    the decay @xmath0 ( @xmath9 mev ) with a branching ratio of @xmath10 @xcite is helicity - suppressed by @xmath11 in the sm .",

    "the triumf pienu experiment @xcite aiming at a more precise measurement of the branching ratio @xmath15 was designed to further reduce this background .    in this paper , we present results of the search for low - energy peaks in the background - suppressed spectrum of @xmath0 decays at rest . +",
    "the extension of the triumf m13 beam line @xcite , which suppressed positrons in the beam to @xmath16 % of pions , delivered a 75@xmath171 mev / c pion beam to the experiment .",

    "the @xmath18 beam was degraded by two thin plastic scintillators b1 and b2 ( 6 mm and 3 mm thick , respectively ) and stopped in an 8-mm thick active target ( b3 ) at a rate of @xmath19 @xmath18/s .        in order to obtain a large solid angle for @xmath20 detection from the decay @xmath0 while reducing variations in material along the positron path , the primary calorimeter was placed on the beam axis .",

    "the observed energy response of the nai(t@xmath22 ) detector to positrons from @xmath23 decays included a peak at 70 mev and a low - energy tail distribution .",
    "pion tracking was provided by wire chambers ( wc1 and wc2 ) each with three - planes ( oriented at 0@xmath24 , @xmath25 ) at the exit of the beam line , and four planes of 0.3-mm thick x and y si - strip counters s1x / y and s2x / y located immediately upstream of the b3 counter .",
    "positron tracking came from one set of x and y si - strip counters ( s3x and s3y ) immediately downstream of the b3 counter , and three layers of wire chambers ( wc3 ) in front of the nai(t@xmath22 ) crystal .",
    "a coincidence of beam counters , b1 , b2 and b3 , with a high b1 threshold defined the pion signal , and a coincidence of positron counters , t1 and t2 , defined the decay - positron signal .",
    "a coincidence of pion and positron signals with a time window of 300 ns to 500 ns was the basis of the main trigger logic .",
    "this was prescaled by a factor of 16 to form an unbiased trigger ( prescaled trigger ) , and the early time window ( 240 ns ) provided another trigger ( early trigger ) that contained most of @xmath0 decays .",
    "beam positrons for detector calibration were accumulated by a separate trigger that required a low pulse height in the b1 counter .",
    "a typical trigger rate was 600 hz , of which 240 hz was for prescaled , 160 hz for early , and 5 hz for beam positron .",
    "the pulse shapes from the plastic counters , the csi crystals and si - strip detectors , and the nai(t@xmath22 ) crystal were digitized at 500 mhz , 60 mhz , and 30 mhz , respectively .",
    "the charge and time of each pulse were first extracted from the waveform .",
    "energy calibration of each detector was based on the energy loss of minimum ionizing particles ( 75 mev / c positrons in the beam ) for plastic and si - strip counters , and 70 mev positrons from @xmath0 decays for the nai(t@xmath22 ) signals .",
    "gain instability was corrected on a run - by - run basis ( typically , every ten minutes ) .",
    "events originating from stopped pions were selected based on their energy losses in b1 , b2 , s1x / y and s2x / y , and the time - of - flight with respect to the primary - proton beam burst ( or the phase of the cyclotron radio frequency ) .",
    "events caused by beam positrons and muons were negligible after the cuts . any events with extra activity in the beam counters including wc1 and wc2 were rejected .",
    "about 40 % of events survived the cuts .",
    "an energy - loss cut based on the minimum energy - loss in t1 , t2 , s3x and s3y was used to select decay - positrons .",
    "the cut reduced beam muons directly hitting those counters and protons coming from pion - nucleus reactions to a negligible level .",
    "a fiducial cut , requiring the hit position at wc3 to be within 8 cm from the beam axis , was imposed to reduce the low energy tail of the @xmath0 peak due to shower leakage from the nai(t@xmath22 ) crystal .",

    "the time window selected was 233 ns following the pion stop time . since the decay @xmath0 involves only two charged particles while the decay @xmath1 has three charged particles with an extra kinetic energy of 4.1 mev deposit from the @xmath26 decay in b3 , pulse shape discrimination based on the likelihood for two and three pulses , and the total energy in the beam counters were also very effective in @xmath1 background suppression . in figure",

    "the major low - energy background in the background - suppressed spectrum came from decay - in - flight ( dif ) of pions near the b3 counter , in which the muon from the @xmath26 decay stopped in b3 and deposited the same kinetic energy as the initial pion @xcite .",

    "the cuts were optimized by minimizing the value @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the numbers of events below and above 54 mev in the positron energy spectrum , respectively . the final background ( including the low - energy tail of the @xmath0 peak ) to peak ratio was @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",

    "however , tighter cuts on the positron emission angle worsened the @xmath40 value . using spectra with",
    "the angle cut was effective only above 47 mev where the impact of the resolution was higher .",
    "there was a shoulder in the positron spectrum approximately at 60 mev that was enhanced with the angle cut .",
    "similar structures observed in the spectrum of the 75-mev / c beam positron shown by the shaded histogram in fig.[angle ] were discussed in ref.@xcite .",

    "the template peak spectrum for each peak energy was obtained by applying the same cuts used in the data analysis to the positrons which were generated by a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation in the b3 counter with the observed pion stopping distribution .",
    "measurements using positron beams at various entrance angles and energies into the nai(t@xmath22 ) crystal confirmed the validity of the mc line shapes including the effects of csi vetoing .",
