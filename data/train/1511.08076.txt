    "the local induction equation ( lie ) @xmath1 is one of the most important models of deformation of space curves , where @xmath2 is a smooth space curve parametrized by the arc - length @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a deformation parameter @xcite . in a physical setting",
    ", it describes the dynamics of vortex filaments driven by the self - induction in the inviscid fluid under the local induction approximation @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that if @xmath5 obeys lie , then the curvature and the torsion , or equivalently , the complex curvature of @xmath5 solves the _ nonlinear schrdinger equation _ ( nls ) which is one of the most typical equations in the integrable systems . to show this",

    "then we have the _ frenet - serret formula _ @xmath12,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the curvature and the torsion , respectively . in this",
    "setting , lie is expressed as the deformation by the binormal flow @xmath15 and the corresponding deformation equation of the frenet frame is given by @xmath16 the compatibility condition of the system of linear partial differential equations and @xmath17 yields @xmath18 introducing the _ complex curvature _ @xmath19 by the _ hasimoto transformation _",
    "@xcite @xmath20 we see that @xmath21 satisfies nls @xmath22 also , one can show that this deformation is isoperimetric , namely @xmath23 for all @xmath4 .",
    "discretization of curves and their deformations preserving underlying integrable structures is an important problem in the discrete differential geometry .",
    "for example , the isoperimetric deformation of plane discrete curves described by the discrete mkdv equation ( dmkdv ) has been studied in @xcite . for discrete space curves , the deformations by the discrete sine - gordon equation",
    "( dsg ) and dmkdv has been studied in @xcite , and the deformation by dnls is formulated in @xcite .",
    "the dsg and dmkdv describe torsion - preserving isoperimetric and equidistant deformation of the space discrete curves with constant torsion . however , formulation of discrete deformation of space discrete curves with varying torsion is a difficult problem .",
    "the only example so far is presented by hoffmann @xcite , where he has claimed that composition of certain two isoperimetric equidistant deformations can be regarded as a discrete analogue of lie .",
    "also , it was used for numerical simulation of fluid flow @xcite .",
    "this formulation uses quarternions and its geometric meaning is clear , but description of the deformation parameters in terms of the complex curvature , thus the relation to dnls are rather indirect .    in this paper",
    ", we present a formulation of the dnls flow on discrete space curves from different approach ; the deformation of curves is expressed in terms of the discrete frenet frame with the coefficients given by the curvature and torsion of the curves explicitly . in this approach",
    ", dnls arises as the equation governing the complex curvature of curves , which is the same as the case of smooth curves .",
    "based on this formulation , we present explicit formulas for the nls flow for smooth curves and the dnls flow to discrete curves in terms of @xmath0 functions of the two - component kp hierarchy by applying the theory of integrable systems .",
    "we expect that our dnls flow can be an alternative to hoffmann s formulation when it is used to simulate the dynamics of fluids",
    ". also , explicit expression of the scheme and exact solutions may promote further development of theoretical studies of discrete dynamics of discrete curves from both mathematical and physical point of view .",
    "let @xmath24 be a discrete space curve with @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a constant .",

    "in fact , one can show that @xmath59 equation also implies that the solution of dnls should satisfy the condition @xmath60 in order to be consistent with the curve deformation .",
    "note that this property does not contradict with hoffmann s formulation where the deformation is constructed as composition of two isoperimetric and equidistant deformations .",
    "continuous limit with respect to time can be simply taken as @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
