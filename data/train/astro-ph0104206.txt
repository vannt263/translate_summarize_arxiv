    "to an even greater extent than large - scale terrestrial ones , astrophysical flows are nearly inviscid .",
    "yet observations show that they dissipate efficiently . for example",
    ", accretion disks ( flattened systems of gas in orbit about a star or black hole ) must lose orbital energy in order that the gas flow onto the central object .",
    "the influence of turbulence has long been suspected , but purely hydrodynamic turbulence is probably ineffective because of the strongly stable radial angular momentum gradient in the disk .",
    "when warm enough to be partially ionised , as they often are , accretion disks become magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) fluids .",
    "it is now believed that turbulence and orbital decay are driven by magnetorotational instabilities ( mri ) .",
    "although discovered by @xcite and @xcite , mri did not come to the attention of the astrophysical community until rediscovered by @xcite .",
    "mri requires that the angular velocity ( @xmath0 ) must decrease with distance from the axis , but it is distinguished from rayleigh s centrifugal instability by persisting when the gradient of specific angular momentum is positive , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath1",
    ". a weak background magnetic field is required , and mri can be axisymmetric when the field parallel to the rotation axis .",
    "the rotation law of accretion disks satisfies both conditions above ( usually @xmath2 ) , and while the magnetic geometry is uncertain , it has little influence on the maximum mri growth rate in ideal mhd unless the field is purely toroidal @xcite",
    ".    there exists a body of experimental work on magnetized couette flow @xcite , but the mri has never been demonstrated in the laboratory .",
    "the main obstacle is that liquid metals are strongly resistive on laboratory scales , with magnetic diffusivity @xmath3 .",
    "the viscosity is much smaller , typically @xmath4 .",
    "their ratio is the magnetic prandtl number @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite also analyzed _ dissipative _ magnetized couette flow .",
    "after laying out general equations for viscous and resistive linearized axisymmetric perturbations , he discarded a term involving shear from the azimuthal induction equation on the grounds that @xmath6 .",
    "in fact the neglected term involves neither @xmath7 nor @xmath8 directly .",
    "thus the commonly used name `` small-@xmath9 approximation '' is somewhat unfortunate .",
    "it presumes that viscous and inertial forces are comparable throughout the flow .",
    "although this is often the case for marginal rayleigh instabilities resisted by viscous ( and perhaps magnetic ) forces , it is not the case for the mri modes of interest here , where viscosity is important in boundary layers only .",
    "we shall show that mri modes do not exist in chandrasekhar s approximation (  3 ) .",
    "we shall introduce a different @xmath10 limit that retains all terms in the induction equation but neglects viscous boundary layers .",
    "chandrasekhar s results have been refined by @xcite , but always under chandrasekhar s `` small-@xmath9 '' approximation .    in a previous paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth paper i ) , we have used local wkb methods to survey the mri regime for realistic materials and laboratory parameters . the most unstable modes ( and perhaps the only ones accessible to experiment in the near term ) have wavelengths twice as large as the apparatus , so that wkb methods are not to be trusted _ a priori_. the present paper therefore discusses the global linear analysis .",
    "we integrate the full set of viscous and resistive equations _ via _ an initial - value scheme to obtain numerical growth rates for cases that would be stable by rayleigh s criterion .",
    "boundary conditions are problematic for inviscid marginal modes .",
    "nevertheless , the locally obtained growth rates are found to be good approximations , even though the radial eigenfunctions are far from being sinusoidal .",
    "we predict instability under feasible conditions : gap widths and heights of order ten centimeters , fields strengths of several kilogauss , and rotation rates of several hundred radians per second .",
    "a supplementary analysis shows that curves of marginal mri stability are well approximated by completely neglecting viscous terms , especially for insulating cylinders .",
    "although @xmath10 , this is _ not _ chandrasekhar s approximation .",
    "it eliminates the velocity perturbations from the analysis and leads to a system of only four radial derivatives .",
    "the boundary conditions on velocity are not satisfied by the reduced system even with stress - free ( slipping ) boundaries .",
    "this is resolved by restoring the viscosity but there is little change in the magnetic eigenfunctions or the growth rate when @xmath9 is realistically small .",
    "hence when mri are of primary interest , dimensionless numbers based on viscosity , _ viz . _",
    "hartmann and taylor numbers , are less useful for characterizing stability than numbers that remain finite as @xmath10 , such as lundquist number and magnetic reynolds number .",
    "we use cylindrical coordinates @xmath11 aligned with the rotation of the fluid , and gaussian electromagnetic units . in equilibrium , the magnetic field is constant and parallel to the axis ; it is described by the associated alfvn speed @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the ( constant ) density of the liquid metal .",

    "barring unforseen algorithmic breakthroughs , the smallest resolvable scale in a three - dimensional simulation improves only as the fourth root of the rate of arithmetic operations . here",
    "it must be acknowledged that the large magnetic diffusivity of liquid metals severely limits the number of degrees of freedom in the magnetic field that can be excited .",

    "<S> global axisymmetric stability of viscous , resistive , magnetized couette flow is re - examined , with the emphasis on flows that would be hydrodynamically stable according to rayleigh s criterion : opposing gradients of angular velocity and specific angular momentum . in this regime , magnetorotational instabilities [ mri ] may occur . </S>",
    "<S> previous work has focused on the rayleigh - unstable regime . to prepare for an experimental study of mri , which are of intense astrophysical interest , we solve for global linear modes in a wide gap with realistic dissipation coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> exchange of stability appears to occur through marginal modes . </S>",
    "<S> velocity eigenfunctions of marginal modes are nearly singular at conducting boundaries , but magnetic eigenfunctions are smooth and obey a fourth - order differential equation in the inviscid limit . </S>",
    "<S> the viscous marginal system is of tenth order ; an eighth - order approximation previously used for rayleigh - unstable modes does not permit mri . </S>",
    "<S> peak growth rates are insensitive to boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> they are predicted with surprising accuracy by wkb methods even for the largest - scale mode . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that mri is achievable under plausible experimental conditions using easy - to - handle liquid metals such as gallium . </S>"
