    "the purpose of this paper is to formalise the `` supercriticality '' barrier for the ( infamous ) global regularity problem for the navier - stokes equation , using a blowup solution to a certain averaged version of navier - stokes equation to demonstrate that any proposed positive solution to the regularity problem which does not use the finer structure of the nonlinearity can not possibly be successful .",
    "this barrier also suggests a possible route to provide a negative answer to this problem , that is to say it suggests a program for constructing a blowup solution to the true navier - stokes equations .",
    "the barrier is not particularly sensitive to the precise formulation of the regularity problem , but to state the results in the cleanest fashion we will take the homogeneous global regularity problem in the euclidean setting in three spatial dimensions as our formulation :    [ nsconj ]  ( * ? ? ?",

    "we perform some standard computations to eliminate the role of the pressure @xmath20 , and to pass from the category of smooth ( classical ) solutions to the closely related category of _ mild _ solutions in a high regularity class .",
    "it will not matter too much what regularity class we take here , as long as it is subcritical , but for sake of concreteness ( and to avoid some very minor technicalities ) we will take a quite high regularity space , namely the sobolev space @xmath21 of ( distributional ) vector fields @xmath22 with @xmath23 regularity ( thus the weak derivatives @xmath24 are square - integrable for @xmath25 ) and which are divergence free in the distributional sense : @xmath26 . by using the @xmath27 inner product inner product in this paper , thus all appearances of the @xmath28 notation",

    "the distinction between smooth finite energy solutions and @xmath68 mild solutions is essentially non - existent ( at least , there is a technical distinction between the two solution concepts , due to a lack of unlimited time regularity at the initial time @xmath69 that is ultimately caused by the non - local effects of the divergence - free condition @xmath26 , requiring one to replace the notion of a smooth solution with that of an _ almost smooth solution _ ; see @xcite for details . however , in this paper we will only concern ourselves with schwartz initial data , so that this issue does not arise . ] for schwartz initial data ) , and the reader may wish to conflate the two notions on a first reading .",
    "more rigorously , we can reformulate conjecture [ nsconj ] as the following logically equivalent conjecture :    [ reg - again ] let @xmath10 be a divergence - free vector field in the schwartz class .",

    "this gives conjecture [ reg - again ] .",

    "if we take the inner product of with @xmath3 and integrate in time using , we arrive at the fundamental _ energy identity _",
    "@xmath85 for any mild solution to the navier - stokes equation .    if one was unaware of the supercritical nature of the navier - stokes equation , one might attempt to obtain a positive solution to conjecture [ nsconj ] or conjecture [ reg - again ] by combining ( or equivalently , ) with various harmonic analysis estimates for the inhomogeneous heat equation @xmath86 ( or , in integral form , @xmath87 ) , together with harmonic analysis estimates for the euler bilinear operator @xmath2 , a simple example of which is the estimate @xmath88 for some absolute constant @xmath89 .",
    "such an approach succeeds for instance if the initial data @xmath19 is sufficiently small is expected to be close to some other special solution than the zero solution .",
    "there is a vast literature in these directions , see e.g. @xcite and the references therein . ] in a suitable critical norm ( see @xcite for an essentially optimal result in this direction ) , or if the dissipative operator @xmath90 is replaced by a hyperdissipative operator @xmath91 for some @xmath92 ( see @xcite ) or with very slightly less hyperdissipative operators ( see @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , standard scaling heuristics ( see e.g. @xcite ) have long indicated to the experts that the energy estimate ( or ) , together with the harmonic analysis estimates available for the heat equation and for the euler bilinear operator @xmath2 , are not sufficient by themselves to affirmatively answer conjecture [ nsconj ] . however , these scaling heuristics are not formalised as a rigorous barrier to solvability , and the above mentioned strategy to solve the navier - stokes global regularity problem continues to be attempted on occasion .",
    "the most conclusive way to rule out such a strategy would of course be to demonstrate a mild solution to the navier - stokes equation that develops a singularity in finite time , in the sense that the @xmath68 norm of @xmath93 goes to infinity as @xmath94 approaches a finite time @xmath95 .",
    "needless to say , we are unable to produce such a solution .",
    "however , we will in this paper obtain a finite time blowup ( mild ) solution to an _ averaged _ equation @xmath96 where @xmath97 will be a ( carefully selected ) averaged version of @xmath2 that has equal or lesser `` strength '' from a harmonic analysis point of view ( indeed , @xmath6 obeys slightly _ more _ estimates than @xmath2 does ) , and which still obeys the fundamental cancellation property .",
    "thus , any successful method to affirmatively answer conjecture [ nsconj ] ( or conjecture [ reg - again ] ) must either use finer structure of the navier - stokes equation beyond the general form , or else must rely crucially on some estimate or other property of the euler bilinear operator @xmath2 that is not shared by the averaged operator @xmath6 .",
    "we pause to mention some previous blowup results in this direction .",
    "if one drops the cancellation requirement , so that one no longer has the energy identity , then blowup solutions for various navier - stokes type equations have been constructed in the literature .",
    "for instance , in @xcite finite time blowup for a `` cheap navier - stokes equation '' @xmath98 ( with @xmath3 now a scalar field ) was constructed in the one - dimensional setting , with the results extended to higher dimensions in @xcite . as remarked in that latter paper , it is essential to the methods of proof that no energy identity is available . in a slightly different direction ,",
    "finite time blowup was established in @xcite for a complexified version of the navier - stokes equations , in which the energy identity was again unavailable ( or more precisely , it is available but non - coercive ) .",
    "these models are not exactly of the type considered in this paper , but are certainly very similar in spirit .",
    "further models of navier - stokes type , which obey an energy identity , were introduced by plech and verk @xcite , @xcite , by katz and pavlovic @xcite , and by hou and lei @xcite ; of these three , the model in @xcite is the most relevant for our work and will be discussed in detail in section [ overview - sec ] below .",
    "these models differ from each other in several respects , but interestingly , in all three cases there is substantial evidence of blowup in five and higher dimensions , but not in three or four dimensions ; indeed , for all three of the models mentioned above there are global regularity results in three dimensions , even in the presence of blowup results for the corresponding inviscid model .",
    "numerical evidence for blowup for the navier - stokes equations is currently rather scant ( except in the infinite energy setting , see @xcite , @xcite ) ; the blowup evidence is much stronger in the case of the euler equations ( see @xcite for a recent result in this direction , and @xcite for a survey ) , but it is as yet unclear whether these blowup results have direct implications for navier - stokes in the three - dimensional setting , due to the relatively significant strength of the dissipation .    finally , we mention work @xcite , @xcite , @xcite establishing finite time blowup for supercritical fractal burgers equations ; such equations are not exactly of navier - stokes type , being scalar one - dimensional equations rather than incompressible vector - valued three - dimensional ones , but from a scaling perspective the results are of the same type , namely a demonstration of blowup whenever the norms controlled by the conservation and monotonicity laws are all supercritical .",
    "we now describe more precisely the type of averaged operator @xmath97 we will consider .",
    "we consider three types of symmetries on @xmath21 that we will average over .",
    "firstly , we have rotation symmetry : if @xmath99 is a rotation matrix on @xmath0 and @xmath47 , then the rotated vector field @xmath100 is also in @xmath21 ; note that the fourier transform also rotates by the same law , @xmath101 clearly , these rotation operators are uniformly bounded on @xmath21 , and also on every sobolev space @xmath102 with @xmath103 and @xmath104 .    next ,",
    "define a ( complex ) _ fourier multiplier of order @xmath62 _ to be an operator @xmath105 defined on ( the complexification @xmath106 of ) @xmath21 by the formula @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a function that is smooth away from the origin , with the seminorms @xmath109 being finite for every natural number @xmath76 .",
    "we say that @xmath105 is _ real _ if the symbol @xmath110 obeys the symmetry @xmath111 for all @xmath112 , then @xmath105 maps @xmath21 to itself . from the hrmander - mikhlin multiplier theorem ( see e.g. @xcite ) , complex fourier multipliers of order @xmath62 are also bounded on ( the complexifications of ) every sobolev space @xmath102 for all @xmath103 and @xmath104 , with an operator norm that depends linearly on finitely many of the @xmath113 .",
    "we let @xmath114 denote the space of all real fourier multipliers of order @xmath62 , so that @xmath115 is the space of complex fourier multipliers ( note that every complex fourier multiplier @xmath105 of order @xmath62 can be uniquely decomposed as @xmath116 with @xmath117 real fourier multipliers of order @xmath62 ) .",
    "fourier multipliers of order @xmath62 do not necessarily commute with the rotation operators @xmath118 , but the group of rotation operators normalises the algebra @xmath114 , and hence also the complexification @xmath119 .",
    "finally , we will average over the dilation operators @xmath120 for @xmath121 .",
    "these operators do not quite preserve the @xmath21 norm , but if @xmath122 is restricted to a compact subset of @xmath123 then these operators ( and their inverses ) will be uniformly bounded on @xmath21 .",
    "we now define an _ averaged euler bilinear operator _ to be an operator @xmath97 , defined via duality by the formula @xmath124 for all @xmath36 , where @xmath125 are random real fourier multipliers of order @xmath62 , @xmath126 are random rotations , and @xmath127 are random dilations , obeying the moment bounds @xmath128 and @xmath129 almost surely for any natural numbers @xmath130 and some finite @xmath89 . to phrase this definition without probabilistic notation , we have @xmath131 for some probability space @xmath132 and some measurable maps @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is given the borel @xmath137-algebra coming from the seminorms @xmath138 , and one has @xmath139 and @xmath140 for all natural numbers @xmath130 .",
    "one can also express @xmath141 without duality by the formula @xmath142 where the integral is interpreted in the weak sense ( i.e. the gelfand - pettis integral ) .",
    "however , we will not use this formulation of @xmath6 here .    by the rotation symmetry",
    "@xmath143 , we may eliminate one of the three rotation operators @xmath144 in if desired , and similarly for the dilation operator . by some fourier analysis ( related to the fractional leibniz rule )",
    "it should also be possible to eliminate one of the fourier multipliers @xmath145 .",
    "however , we will not attempt to do so here .    from duality , the triangle inequality ( or more precisely , minkowski s inequality for integrals ) , and the hrmander - mikhlin multiplier theorem",
    ", we see that every estimate on the euler bilinear operator @xmath2 in sobolev spaces @xmath102 with @xmath104 implies a corresponding estimate for averaged euler bilinear operators @xmath6 ( but possibly with a larger constant ) .",
    "for instance , from we have @xmath146 for @xmath44 , where the constant @xmath147 depends to , we have the freedom to multiply @xmath6 by an arbitrary constant , and so the constants @xmath147 appearing in any given estimate such as can be normalised to any absolute constant ( e.g. @xmath148 ) if desired . ] only on @xmath6 .",
    "a similar argument shows that the expectation in ( or the integral in ) is absolutely convergent for any @xmath36 .",
    "similar considerations hold for most other basic bilinear estimates and @xmath149 for which the hrmander - mikhlin multiplier theorem is not available , or non - convex spaces such as @xmath150 for which the triangle inequality is not available .",
    "however , as the leray projection @xmath38 is also badly behaved on these spaces , such endpoint spaces rarely appear in these sorts of analyses of the navier - stokes equation . ] on @xmath2 in popular function spaces such as hlder spaces , besov spaces , or morrey spaces .",
    "because of this , the local theory ( and related theory , such as the concentration - compactness theory ) for is essentially identical to that of ( up to changes in the explicit constants ) , although we will not attempt to formalise this assertion here .",
    "in particular , we may introduce the notion of a _ mild solution _ to the averaged navier - stokes equation with initial data @xmath151 on a time interval @xmath152 containing @xmath62 , defined to be a continuous map @xmath63 obeying the integral equation @xmath153 for all @xmath154 .",
    "it is then a routine matter to extend the @xmath23 local existence and uniqueness theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) for mild solutions of the navier - stokes equations , to mild solutions of the averaged navier - stokes equations , basically because of the previous observation that all the estimates on @xmath2 used in that local theory continue to hold for @xmath6 .    because we have not imposed any symmetry or anti - symmetry hypotheses on the averaging measure @xmath155 , rotations @xmath156 , and fourier multipliers @xmath157 ,",
    "the analogue @xmath158 of the cancellation condition is not automatically satisfied . if however we have for all @xmath47 , then mild solutions to enjoy the same energy identity as mild solutions to the true navier - stokes equation .",
    "we are now ready to state the main result of the paper .",
    "[ main ] there exists a symmetric averaged euler bilinear operator @xmath97 obeying the cancellation property for all @xmath47 , and a schwartz divergence - free vector field @xmath19 , such that there is no global - in - time mild solution @xmath70 to the averaged navier - stokes equation with initial data @xmath19 .",
    "in fact , the arguments used to prove the above theorem can be pushed a little further to construct a smooth mild solution @xmath159 for some @xmath160 that blows up ( at the spatial origin ) as @xmath94 approaches @xmath95 ( and with subcritical norms such as @xmath161 diverging to infinity as @xmath162 ) .",
    "one can also rewrite the averaged navier - stokes equation in a form more closely resembling , namely @xmath163 where @xmath74 is an averaged version of the convection operator @xmath164 , defined by @xmath165 where @xmath166 for @xmath167 .",
    "we can also ensure that the inviscid form of the averaged navier - stokes equation conserves helicity , as well as total momentum , angular momentum , and vorticity ; see remark [ helicity ] below .",
    "our construction of this averaged bilinear operator @xmath97 and blowup solution @xmath3 will admittedly be rather artificial , as the averaged operator @xmath6 will only retain a carefully chosen ( and carefully weighted ) subset of the nonlinear interactions present in the original operator @xmath2 , with the weights designed to facilitate a specific blowup mechanism while suppressing other nonlinear interactions that could potentially disrupt this mechanism .",
    "there is however a possibility that the proof strategy in theorem [ main ] could be adapted to the true navier - stokes equations ; see section [ program ] below . even without this possibility",
    ", however , we view this result as a significant ( but not completely inpenetrable ) _ barrier _ to a certain class of strategies for excluding such blowup based on treating the bilinear euler operator @xmath2 abstractly , as it shows that any strategy that fails to distinguish between the euler bilinear operator @xmath2 and its averaged counterparts @xmath6 ( assuming that the averages obey the cancellation ) is doomed to failure .",
    "we emphasise however that this barrier does not rule out arguments that crucially exploit specific properties of the navier - stokes equation that are not shared by the averaged versions .",
    "for instance , the arguments in @xcite ( see also the subsequent paper @xcite for an alternate treatment ) , which establish global regularity for navier - stokes subject to a hypothesis of bounded critical norm , rely on a unique continuation property for backwards heat equations which in turn relies on being able to control the nonlinearity pointwise in terms of the solution and its first derivatives .",
    "this is a particular feature of the navier - stokes equation ( in vorticity formulation ) which is difficult to discern from the projected formulation , and does not hold in general in ; in particular , it is not obvious to the author whether the main results in @xcite extend , as the blowup solution constructed in the proof of that theorem is of `` type ii '' in the sense that critical norms of the solution @xmath93 diverge in the limit @xmath162 .",
    "in contrast , the results in @xcite rules out `` type i '' blowup , in which a certain critical norm stays bounded . ] to averaged navier - stokes equations . as such ,",
    "arguments based on such unique continuation properties are ( currently , at least ) examples of approaches to the regularity problem that are not manifestly subject to this barrier ( unless progress is made on the program outlined in section [ program ] below ) .",
    "another example of a positive recent result on the navier - stokes problem that uses the finer structure of the nonlinearity ( and is thus not obviously subject to this barrier ) is the work in @xcite constructing large data smooth solutions to the navier - stokes equations in which the initial data varies slowly in one direction , and which relies on certain delicate algebraic properties of the symbol of @xmath2 .",
    "the philosophy of proof of theorem [ main ] is to treat the dissipative term @xmath168 of as a perturbative error ( which is possible thanks to the supercritical nature of the energy , due to the fact that we are in more than two spatial dimensions ) , and to construct a stable blowup solution to the `` averaged euler equation '' @xmath169 that blows up so rapidly that the effect of adding a dissipation , @xmath170 , to the equation while still obtaining blowup for certain choices of initial data , although for sake of exposition we will only discuss the classical @xmath171 case here .",
    "] term is negligible .",
    "this blowup solution will have a significant portion of its energy concentrating on smaller and smaller balls around the spatial origin @xmath172 ; more precisely , there will be an increasing sequence of times @xmath173 converging exponentially fast to a finite limit @xmath95 , such that a large fraction of the energy ( at least @xmath174 for some small @xmath175 ) is concentrated in the ball @xmath176 centred at the origin .",
    "we will be able to make the difference @xmath177 of the order @xmath178 for some small @xmath179 ; this is about as short as one can hope from scaling heuristics ( see e.g. @xcite for a discussion ) , and indicates a blowup which is almost as rapid and efficient as possible , given the form of the nonlinearity .",
    "in particular , for large @xmath180 , the time difference @xmath177 will be significantly shorter than the dissipation time @xmath181 at that spatial scale , which helps explain why the effect of the dissipative term @xmath168 will be negligible .    to construct the stable blowup solution ,",
    "we were motivated by the work on regularity and blowup of the system of ode @xmath182 for a system @xmath183 of scalar unknown functions @xmath184 , where @xmath185 and @xmath186 are parameters .",
    "this system was introduced by katz - pavlovic @xcite ( with @xmath187 and @xmath188 ) as a dyadic model . ] for the navier - stokes equations , and are related to hierarchical shell models for these equations ( see also @xcite for an earlier derivation of these equations from fourier - analytic considerations ) .",
    "roughly speaking , a solution @xmath189 to this system ( with @xmath188 ) corresponds ( at a heuristic level ) to a solution @xmath3 to an equation similar to or with @xmath3 of the shape @xmath190 for some schwartz function @xmath191 with fourier transform vanishing near the origin .",
    "we remark that the analogue of the energy identity in this setting is the identity @xmath192 valid whenever @xmath193 exhibits sufficient decay as @xmath194 ( we do not formalise this statement here ) .",
    "we will defer for now the technical issue ( which we regard as being of secondary importance ) of transferring blowup results from dyadic navier - stokes models to averaged navier - stokes models , and focus on the question of whether blowup solutions may be constructed for ode systems such as .",
    "blowup solutions for the equation are known to exist for sufficiently small @xmath195 ; specifically , for @xmath196 this was ( essentially ) established in @xcite , while for @xmath197 this was established in @xcite , with global regularity established in the critical and subcritical regimes @xmath198 .",
    "if a blowup solution could be constructed in six and higher dimensions , while the results in @xcite give a version in five and higher dimensions ( and just barely miss the four - dimensional case ) ; this can be done by adapting the arguments in this paper ( and using the above - cited blowup results as a substitute for the lengthier ode analysis in this paper ) , and we leave the details to the interested reader .",
    "interestingly , the results in @xcite , @xcite on a somewhat different navier - stokes type model also indicate blowup in five and higher dimensions , while giving global regularity instead in lower dimensions ; similarly for a third navier - stokes model introduced in @xcite . ] with the value @xmath188 , then this would be a dyadic analogue of theorem [ main ] . unfortunately for our purposes , for the values @xmath199 ,",
    "global regularity was established in @xcite ( for non - negative initial data @xmath200 ) , by carefully identifying a region of phase space that is invariant under forward evolution of , and which in particular prevents the energy @xmath193 from concentrating too strongly at a single value of @xmath180 .",
    "however , the argument in @xcite is sensitive to the specific numerical value of @xmath122 ( and also relies heavily on the assumption of initial non - negativity ) , and does not rule out the possibility of blowup at @xmath188 for some variant of the system .    from multiplying by @xmath193",
    ", we arrive at the energy transfer equations @xmath201 for @xmath202 , which are a local version of , and reveal in particular ( in the non - negative case @xmath203 ) that there is a flow of energy at rate @xmath204 from the @xmath205 mode @xmath193 to the @xmath206 mode @xmath207 . in principle , whenever one is in the supercritical regime @xmath208 , one should be able to start with a delta function initial data @xmath209 for some sufficiently large @xmath210 , and then this transfer of energy should allow for a `` low - to - high frequency cascade '' solution in which the energy moves rapidly from the @xmath211 mode to the @xmath212 mode , with the cascade fast enough to `` outrun '' the dissipative effect of the term @xmath213 in the energy transfer equation , which is lower order when @xmath214 .",
    "however , as observed in @xcite , this cascade scenario does not actually occur as strongly as the above heuristic reasoning suggests , because the energy in @xmath207 is partially transferred to @xmath215 before the transfer of energy from @xmath193 to @xmath207 is fully complete , leading instead to a solution in which the bulk of the energy remains in low values of @xmath180 and is eventually dissipated away by the @xmath213 term before forming a singularity .",
    "thus we see that there is an interference effect between the energy transfer between @xmath193 and @xmath207 , and the energy transfer between @xmath207 and @xmath215 , that disrupts the naive blowup scenario .",
    "one can fix this problem by suitably modifying the model equation .",
    "one rather drastic ( and not particularly satisfactory ) way to do this is to forcibly ( i.e. , _ exogenously _ ) shut off most of the nonlinear interactions , so that only one pair @xmath216 of adjacent modes experiences a nonlinear ( but energy - conserving ) interaction at any given time .",
    "specifically , one can consider a truncated - nonlinearity ode @xmath217 where @xmath218 is a piecewise constant function that one specifies in advance , and which describes which pair of modes @xmath219 is `` allowed '' to interact at a given time @xmath94 .",
    "it is not difficult to construct a blowup solution for this truncated ode ; we do so in section [ beyond ] .",
    "such a result corresponds to a weak version of theorem [ main ] in which the averaged nonlinearity @xmath6 is now allowed to be time dependent , @xmath220 , with the dependence of @xmath221 on @xmath94 being piecewise constant ( and experiencing an unbounded number of discontinuities as @xmath94 approaches @xmath95 ) . in particular , the nonlinearity @xmath221 is experiencing an exogenous oscillatory singularity in time as @xmath94 approaches @xmath95 , making the spatial singularity of the solution @xmath3 become significantly less surprising provides a somewhat non - trivial barrier that can still exclude certain solution strategies to the navier - stokes regularity problem . ] .",
    "our strategy , then , is to design a system of ode similar to that can _ endogenously _ simulate the exogenous truncations @xmath222 , @xmath223 of . as shown in @xcite , this can not be done for the scalar equation , at least when @xmath122 is equal to @xmath224 .",
    "however , by replacing with a vector - valued generalisation , in which one has four scalar functions @xmath225 associated to each scale @xmath180 , rather than a single scalar function @xmath226 , it turns out to be possible to use quadratic interactions of the same strength as the terms @xmath227 appearing in to induce such a simulation , while still respecting the energy identity .",
    "the precise system of ode used is somewhat complicated ( see section [ blowup - sec ] ) , but it can be described as a sequence of `` quadratic circuits '' connected in series , with each circuit built out of a small number of `` quadratic logic gates '' , each corresponding to a certain type of basic quadratic nonlinear interaction . specifically , we will combine together some `` pump '' gates that transfer energy from one mode to another ( and which are the only gate present in ) with `` amplifier '' gates ( that use one mode to ignite exponential growth in another mode ) and `` rotor '' gates ( that use one mode to rotate the energy between two other modes ) . by combining together these gates with carefully chosen coupling constants ( a sort of `` quadratic engineering '' task somewhat analogous to the more linear circuit design tasks in electrical engineering ) , we can set up a transfer of energy from scale @xmath180 to scale @xmath228 which can be made arbitrarily abrupt , in that the duration of the time interval separating the regime in which most of the energy is at scale @xmath180 , and most of the energy is at scale @xmath228 , can be made as small as desired .",
    "furthermore , this transfer is delayed somewhat from the time at which the scale @xmath180 first experiences a large influx of energy .",
    "the combination of the delay in energy transfer and the abruptness of that transfer means that the process of transferring energy from scale @xmath180 to scale @xmath228 is not itself interrupted ( up to negligible errors ) by the process of transferring energy from scale @xmath228 to @xmath229 , and this permits us ( after a lengthy bootstrap argument ) to construct a blowup solution to this equation , which resembles the blowup solution for the truncated ode .",
    "we now briefly discuss how to pass from the dyadic model problem of establishing blowup for a variant of to a problem of the form , though as noted before we view the dyadic analysis as containing the core results of the paper , with the conversion to the non - dyadic setting being primarily for aesthetic reasons ( and to eliminate any lingering suspicion that the blowup here is arising from some purely dyadic phenomenon that is somehow not replicable in the non - dyadic setup ) . by using an ansatz of the form and rewriting everything in fourier space",
    ", one can map the dyadic model problem to a problem similar to , but with the laplacian replaced by a `` dyadic laplacian '' ( similar to the one appearing in @xcite , @xcite ) , and with a bilinear operator @xmath6 which has a fourier representation @xmath230 for a certain tensor - valued symbol @xmath231 that is supported on the region of frequency space where @xmath232 are comparable in magnitude , and having magnitude @xmath233 in that region ( together with the usual estimates on derivatives of the symbol ) .",
    "meanwhile , thanks to , @xmath2 has a similar representation @xmath234 with @xmath110 being a singular ( tensor - valued ) distribution on the hyperplane @xmath235 . after averaging over some rotations",
    ", one can does not quite perform these steps in the order indicated here , however all the ingredients mentioned here are still used at some point in the rigorous argument .",
    "] `` smear out '' the distribution @xmath110 to be absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath236 , and then by suitably modulating by fourier multipliers of order @xmath62 ( and in particular , differentiation operators of imaginary order ) one can localise the symbol to the region of frequency space where @xmath232 are comparable in magnitude . by performing some suitable fourier - type decompositions of the latter symbol , we are then able to express @xmath237 as an average of various transformations of @xmath110 , giving rise to a description of @xmath6 as an averaged navier - stokes operator .",
    "ultimately , the problem boils down to the task of establishing a certain non - degeneracy property of the tensor symbol @xmath238 defined in , which one establishes by a short geometric calculation .",
    "the averaging over dilations in theorem [ main ] is needed in order to ensure this non - degeneracy property , but it is likely that this averaging can be dropped by a more careful analysis .",
    "this almost finishes the proof of theorem [ main ] , except that the dyadic model equation involves the dyadic laplacian instead of the euclidean laplacian .",
    "however , it turns out that the analysis of the dyadic system of ode can be adapted to the case of non - dyadic dissipation , by using local energy inequalities as a substitute for the exact ode that appear in the dyadic model . while this complicates the analysis slightly , the effect is ultimately negligible due to the perturbative nature of the dissipation .",
    "to summarise the strategy of proof of theorem [ main ] , a solution to a carefully chosen averaged version @xmath239 of the euler equations is constructed which behaves like a `` von neumann machine '' ( that is , a self - replicating machine ) in the following sense : at a given time @xmath173 , it evolves as a sort of `` quadratic computer '' , made out of `` quadratic logic gates '' , which is `` programmed '' so that after a reasonable period of time @xmath177 , it abruptly `` replicates '' into a rescaled version of itself ( being @xmath240 times smaller , and about @xmath241 times faster ) , while also erasing almost completely the previous iteration of this machine .",
    "this replication process is stable with respect to perturbations , and in particular can survive the presence of a supercritical dissipation if the initial scale of the machine is sufficiently small .",
    "this suggests an ambitious ( but not obviously impossible ) program ( in both senses of the word ) to achieve the same effect for the true navier - stokes equations , thus obtaining a negative answer to conjecture [ nsconj ] .",
    "define an _ ideal ( incompressible , inviscid ) fluid _ to be a divergence - free vector field @xmath3 that evolves according to the true euler equations @xmath242 somewhat analogously to how a quantum computer can be constructed from the laws of quantum mechanics ( see e.g. @xcite ) , or a turing machine can be constructed from cellular automata such as conway s `` game of life '' ( see e.g. @xcite ) , one could hope to design logic gates entirely out of ideal fluid ( perhaps by using suitably shaped vortex sheets to simulate the various types of physical materials one would use in a mechanical computer ) .",
    "if these gates were sufficiently `` turing complete '' , and also `` noise - tolerant '' , one could then hope to combine enough of these gates together to `` program '' a von neumann machine consisting of ideal fluid that , when it runs , behaves qualitatively like the blowup solution used to establish theorem [ main ] .",
    "note that such replicators , as well as the related concept of a _",
    "universal constructor _ , have been built within cellular automata such as the `` game of life '' ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "once enough logic gates of ideal fluid are constructed , it seems that the main difficulties in executing the above program are of a `` software engineering '' nature , and would be in principle achievable , even if the details could be extremely complicated in practice .",
    "the main mathematical difficulty in executing this `` fluid computing '' program would thus be to arrive at ( and rigorously certify ) a design for logical gates of inviscid fluid that has some good noise tolerance properties . in this regard",
    ", ideas from quantum computing ( which faces a unitarity constraint somewhat analogous to the energy conservation constraint for ideal fluids , albeit with the key difference of having a linear evolution rather than a nonlinear one ) may prove to be useful .",
    "a significant ( but perhaps not insuperable ) obstacle to this program is that in addition to the conservation of energy , the euler equations obey a number of additional conservation laws , such as conservation of helicity , with vortex lines also being transported by the flow ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this places additional limitations on the type of fluid gates one could hope to construct ; however , as these conservation laws are indefinite in sign , it may still be possible to design computational gates that respect all of these laws .",
    "it is worth pointing out , however , that even if this program is successful , it would only demonstrate blowup for a very specific type of initial data ( and tiny perturbations thereof ) , and is not necessarily in contradiction with the belief that one has global regularity for _ most _ choices of initial data ( for some carefully chosen definition of `` most '' , e.g. with overwhelming ( but not almost sure ) probability with respect to various probability distributions of initial data ) .",
    "however , we do not have any new ideas to contribute on how to address this latter question , other than to state the obvious fact that deterministic methods alone are unlikely to be sufficient to resolve the problem , and that stochastic methods ( e.g. those based on invariant measures ) are probably needed .",
