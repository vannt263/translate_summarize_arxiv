    "the science surrounding the origin of life presents an obvious difficulty to scientists : our data consist of a single example .",
    "it is unknown whether the events that followed the origin of life are deterministic consequences of life or unique to this specific origin .",
    "one question of interest is whether all life , or specifically all self - replicators , are evolvable .",
    "evolvability ( the ability to evolve ) has many similar , but differing definitions  @xcite ; here , we define it as the ability to increase in fitness .",
    "we also distinguish between two possibilities for such fitness increases : _ optimization_defined as the ability to improve an already - present phenotypic trait , and _ innovation_the ability to evolve novel phenotypic traits .",
    "a common assumption is that life originated with self - replicating rna molecules  @xcite .",
    "thus , most empirical studies have focused on rna replicators , either emergent replicators  @xcite or those created by experimenters  @xcite .",
    "experiments ( both computational and biochemical ) have also explored the evolvability of rna replicators , usually involving extensive mapping of their fitness landscapes  @xcite .",
    "while rna is an enticing candidate for a pre - biotic molecule , the so - called  rna world hypothesis \" has its own problems  foremost the  asphaltization \" that tends to befall formose carbohydrates under the expected conditions of an early earth  @xcite  which has led researchers to explore other origins of life not necessarily rna - based  @xcite , or even to move the origin of life from earth to mars  @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", more and more theoretical models concerning the origin of life have focused on exploring the abstract concepts that could possibly be involved in any potential origination , independent of a particular biochemical system  @xcite .",
    "the field of artificial life is ideally suited to study various possibilities for the origin of life as it imagines life as it could be , not just as it is .",
    "the question of the random emergence of replicators has been addressed in various digital systems before  @xcite , while theoretical models have explored the factors that lead to differing evolvability  @xcite .",
    "artificial life tools have also been used to explore the potential of evolvability in different systems  @xcite .",
    "recently , adami used information theory to calculate the likelihood of the random emergence of a self - replicator  in a sense , the progenitor to life  without regards to a specific biochemistry  @xcite .",
    "adami and labar tested this theory with avida by generating billions of random avidian sequences and checking for their ability to replicate themselves  @xcite . such an investigation is akin to studying the chance emergence of self - replicating rna molecules  @xcite . in previous work",
    "we explored the relationship between evolvability and self - replication using these emergent replicators  @xcite , and found that almost all emergent replicators were evolvable , both in terms of optimization for replication and in terms of evolving beneficial phenotypic innovations .",
    "we also discovered that these replicators came in two forms : proto - replicators and self - replicators .",
    "proto - replicators deterministically copy themselves inaccurately , but eventually evolve into self - replicators ; self - replicators , on the other hand , produce an exact copy of themselves in the absence of stochastic mutation .",
    "we also noted the possibility of an optimization - innovation trade - off in some of these replicators , especially the default avida ancestor ( a hand - written self - replicator specifically designed for evolution experiments ) .    here , we extend our previous study and test a fundamental question concerning life s origins : how does the genetic composition of the first replicator determine the future evolution of life ?",
    "one extreme possibility is that all emergent replicators have similar genetic compositions and thus the future evolution of life will occur in a similar manner , no matter the progenitor . on the opposite end of the spectrum is the possibility that every emergent replicator is sufficiently different from every other replicator in genetic composition . in this case , the future outcome of life may be entirely dependent on which replicator emerges first . in experiments with the artificial life system avida , we find that the interplay between the genetic composition of the first emergent replicator and future evolutionary outcomes is between these two extremes .",
    "emergent replicators can be classified into two distinct classes based on a functional analysis of their replication machinery .",
    "these classes differ in their ability to optimize their replication ability .",
    "however , those replication classes that display high evolvability towards optimizing replication also demonstrate low evolvability towards evolving novel phenotypic traits , and vice versa .",
    "finally , we show that this difference in evolvability is due to differences in the replication machinery between the different replicator classes",
    "in order to study the interplay between emergent replicators and evolvability , we used the avida digital evolution platform  @xcite . in avida , simple computer programs (  avidians \" ) in a population compete for the memory space and cpu time needed to replicate themselves .",
    "each avidian consists of a genome of computer instructions , where each locus in the genome can be one of 26 possible instructions .",
    "contained with each genome are the instructions necessary for the avidian to allocate a daughter genome , copy its genome into this new daughter genome , and divide off the daughter genome .",
    "as the replication process is mechanistic ( i.e. , avidians execute their genome s instructions , including those to replicate , sequentially ) , the speed at which replication occurs is also genome dependent",
    ". therefore , fitness is genome - dependent , as an organism s ultimate success is determined by its replication speed in these simple environments .",
    "as avidians directly copy and pass their genomes to their daughters , avida populations also have heredity . during the copying process",
    ", errors may be introduced , resulting in mutations and population variation .",
    "therefore , avida populations possess heredity , variation , and differential fitness : they are an _ instantiation _ ( as opposed to a simulation ) of darwinian evolution  @xcite this simpler instantiation of evolution by natural selection has allowed for the exploration of many topics hard to test in biological systems , see e.g.  @xcite .    avida has been explained in greater detail elsewhere ( see  @xcite for a full description ) ; here , we will cover the details relevant for this study .",
    "an avidian consists of a variety of elements : a genome of instructions , a ",
    "read - head \" that marks which instruction should be copied , a ",
    "write - head \" that denotes where the read - head - marked instruction should be copied to , and three registers to hold integer numbers ( ax , bx , and cx ) , among other elements .    in order to undergo reproduction",
    ", an avidian needs to perform four operations in the following order .",
    "first , it must execute an _ h - allocate _ instruction which allocates a fixed number of _ nop - a _ instructions to the end of its genome ( here 15 , as we work exclusively with length 15 genomes ) .",
    "these _ nop - a _ instructions are inert by themselves , and serve as placeholders to be replaced by actual information . allocation of this memory prepares the daughter genome space to receive the information from the parent .",
    "next , the read - head and write - head must be set 15 instructions apart , allowing for the instructions in the parent genome to be copied into the daughter genome .",
    "these operations are algorithmically similar to creating a dna replication fork at the origin of replication , preparing for the assembly of a copied sequence . following this step",
    ", the genome must find a way of looping over the _ h - copy _ instruction in the genome to actually copy instructions from the parent into the daughter genome , similar to the action of a dna polymerase fusing the new ( daughter ) nucleotides on the former parent strand .",
    "this copying can be done by either looping through the entire genome ( using the circular nature of the genome to re - use a single _ h - copy _ command as many times as necessary to copy all instructions ) or else by continuously looping over a smaller set of instructions in the genome ( called the  copy loop \" ) .",
    "the latter algorithm requires marking the set of instructions ( the  replication gene \" ) so as to control the forking of execution flow .",
    "finally , an avidian must execute an _ h - divide _ instruction to divide the duplicated genome into two avidians , and thus successfully reproduce .    in the experimental design used here , we used two different mechanisms to produce mutations during replication .",
    "the first mechanism produces at most one _ point mutation _ at a random locus in the genome at a rate of 0.15 mutations per genome per generation upon successful division .",
    "the second mechanism is a deterministic ( or  incipient \" ) mutation , which occurs when the instructions in an avidian cause it to copy instructions into the daughter genome in the wrong place . often , this results in a daughter genome with one or two _ nop - a _ instructions at the beginning if these two loci were skipped over during the copying process , remaining instead in their pristine form .",
    "in many cases , such a faulty copy algorithm results in the offspring being non - viable ; however , in some cases viable offspring are produced . sometimes , this incipient mutation mechanism results in the phenomenon of _ proto - replicators _ , defined as those replicators that deterministically ( i.e. , reproducibly because genetically controlled ) make an offspring different from itself  @xcite .",
    "replicators that instead deterministically make an identical offspring are called self - replicators .    in the standard experimental evolution scenario ,",
    "avidians are placed into a landscape that rewards a variety of phenotypic traits .",
    "these traits commonly refer to the ability to perform certain boolean logic calculations on binary numbers that the environment provides . during an avidian s lifespan , they can input ( read from ) and output ( write to ) binary numbers from / to the environment . whenever a number is written , the avida world checks if a boolean logic calculation was performed .",
    "successful performance results in an increase in the replication speed of that individual s descendants . in the standard avida design ( also the one used here in the experiments to explore evolvability in the sense of innovation ) that environment rewards the performance of nine different calculations .",
    "this environment is usually referred to as the  logic-9 \" environment and rewards calculations such as not and equals  @xcite .",
    "the more complex the calculation performed , the greater the replication speed increase . the performance of such logic calculations can be viewed as an algorithmic analogue of performing different metabolizing reactions using different sugar resources ( the binary numbers provided by the environment ) .      to study the evolvability of emergent replicators , we first had to generate a collection of emergent replicators .",
    "we re - analyzed a list of 10@xmath6 random avidian length-15 genomes generated previously  @xcite . in order to discover replicators of fixed genome size",
    ", we set the offspring size range parameter in the main avida configuration file to 1.0 , which guarantees that the _ allocate _ command allocates exactly as much space as needed by the daughter genome . for our focus on replicators of length 15",
    ", this guaranteed that exactly 15 instructions are allocated for the daughter to receive   next , we looked at the relative abundance of proto - replicators compared to true self - replicators . we re - analyzed the above set of replicators , but made one additional parameter change : we set require exact copy to 1 .",
    "any replicator that registered as having zero fitness in this analysis would deterministically copy its genome inaccurately , and would be classified as proto - replicators . any replicators that could reproduce themselves accurately under this treatment",
    "were classified as self - replicators .    in order to test the evolvability of the these replicators , we performed three different experimental tests . for all experiments",
    ", we used a population size of 3600 .",
    "individuals offspring were placed in any random cell in the 60x60 grid , thus mimicking a well - mixed environment .",
    "point mutations were applied upon division and the genomic mutation rate was 0.15 mutations per generation .",
    "genome size was fixed at 15 instructions .",
    "the first experiment tested the replicators evolvability in the sense of replication optimization ( optimization experiments ) . in this experiment , each replicator was used to seed 10 populations ; these populations evolved for 10@xmath7 generations .",
    "phenotypic traits were not under selection in these experiments , that is , evolution only optimized the replication machinery .",
    "next , we performed evolution experiments ( referred to as the  innovation \" experiments ) where we rewarded individuals for evolved phenotypic traits ( i.e. , logic tasks ) besides any increase in replicatory prowess .",
    "we ran the innovation experiments for 10@xmath8 generations ( an order of magnitude longer than the optimization experiments ) .",
    "these experiments were designed to decrease the likelihood that our data resulted from one of the replicator classes taking longer to evolve complex traits . finally , we repeated the innovation experiments , but used each ancestral replicator s fittest descendant from the optimization experiments to initialize the populations ( trade - off experiments ) .",
    "these experiments tested the presence of an optimization  innovation trade - off .",
    "once we determined the set of replicators , we first tried to determine if there were similarities in the genomes of the replicators .",
    "we realized that many of the genomes had similar instruction motifs within the sequence . to test whether different replication algorithms existed in different replicators , we used avida s trace function to analyze the step - by - step execution of the replicators genomes .",
    "this allowed us to cluster the emergent replicators into two main distinct functional replicator classes .    to examine the results from the evolution treatments",
    ", we analyzed the most abundant genotype at the end of each experiment .",
    "the data collected included the final evolved fitness and the number of evolved phenotypic traits .",
    "all avida analysis was performed using avida s analyze mode with settings matching those under which the relevant experiments were performed .",
    "statistical analyses were performed using the numpy , scipy , and pandas python modules  @xcite .",
    "figures were generated using the matplotlib python module  @xcite .",
    "among the one billion randomly - generated genomes , we found 75 genomes that could replicate themselves when genome size was fixed .",
    "of these replicators , 22 were true self - replicators in the sense that they could perfectly copy their genomes even when mutations were turned off .",
    "the remaining 53 replicators were  proto - replicators \" in the sense that they could _ not _ produce a perfect copy of their genome when the mutation rate was set to zero .",
    "this deterministic miscopying is due to the specific nature of a proto - replicator s genome ( see methods ) .",
    "however , these replicators still produced viable offspring that would eventually lead to a self - replicator .",
    "the discovery of these proto - replicators extends the definition of proto - replicators from  @xcite to include fixed - length proto - replicators .      upon examination of these replicators",
    ", we detected the presence of distinct instruction motifs in their genomes .",
    "these motifs consist of instructions involved in genome replication and suggested that different replicators used different replication mechanisms . to explore this possibility",
    ", we performed a step - by - step analysis of each replicator s lifestyle by looking at the execution of their genome s instructions .",
    "avidians must perform four steps to successfully reproduce : allocate a blank daughter genome , separate their read- and write - heads , copy their genome into the daughter genome through some looping process , and divide off the daughter genome ( see methods for a fuller description ) .",
    "we were able to cluster the replicators into two replication classes based on a difference in two traits : ( 1 ) how they separated their read- and write - heads to copy their genome and ( 2 ) how they looped through their genome in order to copy their genome .",
    "we named the first class of replicators  hc \" replicators because of the hc instruction motif they all share ( see table  [ avidainst ] for the avida instructions and their descriptions ) .",
    "this class contains 62 replicators ( 9 self - replicators ) .",
    "only 8 of these replicators have a standard copy loop ( see methods for a definition of a copy loop ) , which appears at the end of their genomes ; these copy loops were marked by the presence of a _ mov - head _",
