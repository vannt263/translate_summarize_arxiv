    "coherence is ultimately the most distinctive feature of quantum systems .",
    "finding a proper measure of the coherence present at different times scales in a quantum dynamical system is the first essential step for assessing the role of quantum interference in natural and artificial processes .",
    "this is of particular relevance for those quantum evolutions in which information or energy are transformed and transferred in order to achieve a given task with high efficiency . in this context",
    "the relevant questions are : how much and what kind of coherence is created vs destroyed by the dynamical evolution ? how does coherence determine / enhance the performance of the given process ?",
    "these are in general difficult questions and to be answered they require an appropriate and sufficiently comprehensive framework . a general and fundamental formalism to describe quantum interference is provided by the decoherent histories ( dh ) approach to quantum mechanics .",
    "dh have mainly found applications to foundational issues of quantum mechanics such as the formulation of a consistent framework to describe closed quantum systems , the emergence of classical mechanics from a quantum substrate , the solution of quantum paradoxes , decoherence theory , quantum probabilities @xcite . however , dh can also be a systematic tool for quantifying interference in quantum processes , and discussing its relevance therein . indeed ,",
    "dh provide a precise mathematical formalization of interference by means of the the so called _ decoherence matrix _ @xmath0 .",
    "the latter is built on the elementary notion of _ histories _ and allows one to describe the quantum features vs the classical ones in tems of interference between _ histories _ , or _ pathways _ if one resorts to the mental picture of the double slit experiments .",
    "it is however difficult to quantify in a compact and meaningful way the content of @xmath0 and its implications for the dynamics of specific systems .",
    "our first main goal is therefore to define and test appropriate measures allowing for the investigation of how interference can determine the performance of a given quantum information processing task .",
    "starting from @xmath0 and by its sub - blocks we define different functionals .",
    "in particular , we introduce a global measure of coherence @xmath1 able to describe the coherence content of a general quantum evolution at its various time scales ; an average ( over different time - scales ) measure of coherence ; and average mesure of interference between histories leading to a specific output .    while the tools we introduce are of general interest and application , in order to test them we apply them to a specific but relevant instance of quantum dynamics taking place in photosynthetic membranes of bacteria and plants : quantum energy transport . here",
    "the basic common mechanism is the following : a quantum excitation is first captured by the system and then migrates through a network of sites ( chromophores ) towards a target site , e.g. , a reaction center , where the energy is transformed and used to trigger further chemical reactions .",
    "there is now an emerging consensus that efficient transport in natural and biologically - inspired artificial light - harvesting systems builds on a finely tuned balance of quantum coherence and decoherence caused by environmental noise @xcite , a phenomenon known as environment - assisted quantum transport ( enaqt ) .",
    "this paradigm has emerged with clarity in recent years , as modern spectroscopic techniques first suggested that exciton transport within photosynthetic complexes might be coherent over appreciable timescales  @xcite .",
    "indeed , a growing number of experiments has provided solid evidence that coherent dynamics occurs even at room temperature for unusually long timescales ( of the order of @xmath2 )  @xcite .",
    "efforts to describe these systems have led to general models of enaqt  @xcite , depicting the complex interplay of three key factors : coherent motion , i.e. , quantum delocalization of the excitation over different sites , environmental decoherence , and localization caused by a disordered energy landscape .",
    "so far , the presence of coherence in light - harvesting systems has been qualitatively associated to the observation of distinctive ` quantum features ' .",
    "originally , coherence was identified with ` quantum wavelike ' behavior as reflected by quantum beats in the dynamics of chromophore populations within a photosynthetic complex .",
    "later works , employing quantum - information concepts and techniques , have switched attention towards quantum correlations between chromophores , in particular quantum entanglement@xcite .",
    "besides being open to criticism ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , these approaches do not provide direct quantitative measures of coherence in the presence of noise .",
    "therefore , in what follows , we shall apply the novel tools based on dh to a simple yet fundamental model of quantum energy transfer .",
    "we will focus on a relevant trimeric subunit of the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) complex , the first pigment - protein complex to be structurally characterized @xcite .",
    "the trimer is virtually the simplest paradigmatic model retaining the basic charcteristics of a disordered transfer network and it can also be conceived as an essential building block of larger networks . for simplicity , we will use the well - known haken - strobl model  @xcite to describe the interplay between hamiltonian and dephasing dynamics .",
    "while the model is an oversimplified description of the actual dynamics taking place in real systems , it allows to spot out the essential features that may determine the high efficiency of the transport .",
    "we shall initially focus on a new coherence measure @xmath1 , based on the decoherence matrix , and characterize its behavior verifying that it can consistently identify the bases and timescales over which quantum coherent phenomena are present during the evolution of the system .",
    "we shall then show how the average coherence exhibited on those time scales can be connected with the delocalization process .",
    "a more detailed analysis will be aimed at distinguishing between constructive and destructive interference affecting the histories ending at the site where the excitation exits the photosynthetic structure . by using the decoherence functional",
    ", we will show that the beneficial role of dephasing for the transport efficiency lies in a selective suppression of destructive interference , a fact that has been systematically suggested in the literature , but never expressed within a general and comprehensive framework that allows the quantitative evaluation of coherence and its effects .",
    "the application of the introduced tools and methods based on dh to a simple yet paradigmatic system shows how one can properly quantify the coherence content of a complex quantum dynamics and elucidate the role of coherence in determining the overall efficiency of the process  @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : decoherent - histories ] we review the basic decoherent histories formalism . in section",
    "[ sec : the - coherence - measure ] we define the measure of coherence @xmath1 and describe its meaning and properties . in section [ sec : trimer ]",
    "we first introduce the used model for describing the energy transport in the selected trimeric complex .",
    "we then discuss the coherence properties of the excitonic transport : by means of the appropriate measures based on the decoherent histories formalism we identify the essential features that may determine the high efficiency of the transport . in section [ sec : fmo ] we briefly discuss how to extend our results to the whole fmo complex . in section [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our results an draw our conclusions .",
    "the formalism of decoherent ( or consistent ) histories was developed in slightly different flavors by griffiths  @xcite , gell - mann  @xcite , hartle@xcite and omns  @xcite .",
    "dh provide a consistent formulation of quantum mechanics where probabilities of measurement outcomes are replaced by probabilities of _ histories_. in this formulation , external measurement apparatuses are not needed , and then one does not need to postulate a  classical domain of observers . as a consequence ,",
    "quantum mechanics becomes a theory that allows the calculation of probabilities of sequences of events within any closed system , including the whole universe , without the necessity of invoking postulates about the role of measurement . in this framework ,",
    "the  classical domain can be seen to emerge as the description of the system becomes more and more coarse - grained .",
    "the idea of ` histories ' stems from feynman s ` sum - over - histories ' formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "as is known , any amplitude @xmath3 between an initial and a final state can be expressed as a sum over paths , or histories : upon inserting the identity decomposition @xmath4 at differerent times @xmath5 we get    @xmath6    where we use the heisenberg notation @xmath7 .",
    "thus the total amplitude @xmath3 is decomposed as a sum of amplitudes , each one corresponding to a different _ history _ identified by a sequence of projectors @xmath8 .",
    "the decoherent histories formalism assumes that histories are the fundamental objects of quantum theory and gives a prescription to attribute probabilities to ( sets of ) histories .",
    "a history is defined as a sequence of projectors at times @xmath9 .",
    "probabilites can be assigned within exhaustive sets of exclusive histories , i.e. , sets of histories @xmath10 where subscripts @xmath11 label different alternatives at times @xmath12 .",
    "histories are exhaustive and exclusive in the sense that the projectors at each time satisfy relations of orthogonality @xmath13 , and completeness , @xmath14 . in other words ,",
    "the projectors @xmath15 define a projective measurement . within a specified set",
    ", any history can be identified with the sequence of alternatives @xmath16 realized at times @xmath12 .",
    "different alternative histories can be grouped together with a procedure called _ coarse - graining_. starting from histories @xmath17 and @xmath18 we can define a new , _ coarse - grained _",
    "history @xmath19 by summing projectors for all times @xmath20 such that @xmath21 and @xmath22 differ : @xmath23 for all @xmath24 . by iterating this procedure",
    ", one can obtain more and more coarse - grained histories .",
    "a special type of coarse - graining is the _ temporal coarse - graining _ : we group together histories @xmath25 such that such that at some time @xmath20 we have @xmath26 .",
    "then the coarse - grained history @xmath27 contains only one - projector ( equal to the identity ) at time @xmath20 , that can be neglected and hence removed from the string of projectors defining the history . on the other hand _ temporal fine - graining _ can be implemented for example by allowing different alternatives at a times @xmath28 . in particular",
    ", one can create new sets of histories @xmath29 from a given one @xmath30 by adding different alternatives at time @xmath31 ; the sets @xmath32 are fine grained versions of the sets @xmath30 .",
    "+ once we specify the initial state @xmath33 and the ( unitary ) time evolution @xmath34 , we can assign any history @xmath17 a _ weight _ @xmath35,\\quad\\mbox{with}\\quad c_{{\\mathbf{j}}}=p_{j_{n}}(t_{n})\\dots p_{j_{1}}(t_{1})\\ ] ] where we use the heisenberg notation @xmath36 .",

    "first , one has to check whether the measure properly takes into account the action of the bath .",
    "in particular , if the bath is characterized by a decoherence time @xmath122 , it is known ( @xcite ) that on time scales @xmath123 the decoherence matrix becomes diagonal : the probability of a history at time @xmath124 can be fully determined by its probability at time @xmath58 , since no interference can occur between different histories . indeed , the action of the bath is to create a _",

    "therefore , the fine - graining procedure obtained by constructing a set of histories @xmath32 via the addition of a new complete set of projections in the same basis at time @xmath125 to the set @xmath30 , should leave the coherence functional @xmath87 invariant , i.e. , @xmath126 .",

    "however , as for the system considered in this paper the computational effort is contained due to the small number of subsystems ( chromophores ) and the small dimension of the hilbert space which is limited to the single - exciton manifold . as we shall see , by limiting the choice of @xmath132 to a reasonable number , the analysis can be fruitfully carried even on a laptop .",

    "the efficiency of the transport can be evaluated as the leak of the population @xmath151 of the exit site @xmath152 towards the sink : @xmath153 the overall efficiency of the process is obtained by letting @xmath154    while its markovianity limits the faithful description of decoherence processes actually taking place in real photosynthetic systems , _ _ the model retains the basic and commonly accepted aspects of decoherence , that acts in the site basis : albeit in a complex non - markovian way , the protein enviroment measures the system locally ( i.e. , on each site ) , thus _ _ destroying the coherence in the site basis and creating it in the exciton basis . note that the formalism can also be applied to a ` dressed ' or polaronic basis where we include strong interactions between chromophores and vibrational modes .",

    "the often recalled `` convergence '' of time scales or `` goldilocks '' effect ( @xcite ) in biological quantum transport systems seems therefore to be well rooted in the processes discussed above : if decoherence is too small the system shows both positive and negative interference ( see fig .",
    ": pop site 3 and delocalization ] ) , the delocalization has an ocillatory behavior , and the exciton bounces back and forth along the network thus preventing its efficient extraction .",
    "if instead decoherence is very high one has that the complete washing out of intereference and coherence implies the delocalization process to be very slow , no matter how fast the trapping mechanism try to suck the exciton out of the system . in order to take advantage of the effects of quantum coherent dynamics : @xmath258 the bath must act on the typical time scales of quantum evolution in order to implement the quantum recoil avoiding process ; @xmath259 the extraction of the exciton from the complex , characterized by @xmath146 , must then start soon after the initial fast delocalization has taken place .",
    "should the extraction take place on longer time scales , the benefits of the fast initial delocalization would be spoiled : waiting long enough , the system would eventually reach together with equilibrium a decent delocalization even for moderately high values of @xmath176 , but in this case the transfer would be obviously much slower .",
    "the above arguments can be easily applied to the whole fmo complex . fig .  [",

    "the main features of the behavior of @xmath260 and @xmath251 are maintained although obvious differences can be found since the dynamics in now determined by the interplay of different eigenperiods and interference paths are more complex .",
    "in particular , fig.[fig : fmo c various gammas and c vs h](b ) , one can observe a revival of positive interference @xmath261 for small values of @xmath262 , that does enhance the efficiency for @xmath263 , fig .",
    "[ fig : fmo average i on 200 fs 3 site and efficiency](a ) ; but this is not sufficient to compensate the initial and subsequent negative interference , thus impeding the reach of optimal values of @xmath251 . in general , compared to the trimer and as suggested by fig .",

    "the overall picture is not significantly affected if one decides to start the dynamics from site @xmath264 instead of site @xmath117 , as it often is reported in the literature .",
    "the decoherent histories approach provides a general theory to study the distinctive feature exhibited by quantum systems : coherence . however , despite its generality and foundational character , in order to measure the effects of coherence and decoherence the dh approach needs to be complemented with a quantitative way to condense the information contained in the basic object of the theory , i.e. , the decoherence matrix @xmath265 . in this paper",
    "we introduce a set of tools that allow one to assess the ( global ) coherence properties of quantum ( markovian ) evolution and that can be used to relate the coherence content of a general quantum dynamical process to the relevant figure of merits of the given problem .",

    "_ while this measure is completely general , one can further introduce other relevant tools tailored to the specific system and type of system - environment interaction at hand .",

    "based on @xmath265 and @xmath100 we define : @xmath266 a measure @xmath267 able to characterize the average coherence exhibited by the dynamics of the system over the time scales @xmath268 for a fixed value of the dephasing @xmath176 ; @xmath269 a measure of the average interference @xmath270 occurring between the histories ending at a given `` site '' @xmath134 .",
    "+ within the specific model , we first thoroughly assess the consistency of the behavior of @xmath100 in the various regimes .",
    "we then show how the introduced tools allow to study the intricate connections between the efficiency of the transport process and the coherence properties of the dynamics .",
    "in particular we show that the delocalization of the exciton over the chromophoric subunit is strongly affected by the amount of ( average ) coherence allowed by the interaction with the bath in the first tens to hundreds of femtoseconds .",
    "if the system - bath interaction is too strong , coherence is suppressed alongside the interference between different histories , in particular those ending at the site where the excitation leaves the complex .",
    "if the interaction is too weak the system exhibits high values of coherence even on long time scales , but it also exhibits negative interference between pathways ending at the exit site , a manifestation of the fact that the exciton bounces back and forth over the network thus preventing its efficient extraction . in the intermediate regime",
    "i.e. , when the different time scales of the system ( quantum oscillations , decoherence and trapping rate ) converge , the system shows high values of coherence on those time scales .",
    "the action of the bath has a _ quantum recoil avoiding effect _ on the dynamics of the excitation : the _ benefits of the fast initial quantum delocalization of the exciton over the network are preserved and sustained in time by the dynamics _ ; in terms of pathways leading to the exit site , the action is to s__electively kill the negative interference between pathways , while retaining the initial positive one . _",
    "_ these effects can be explicitly connected to the overall efficiency of the environment - assisted quantum transport : the gain in efficiency for intermediate ( optimal ) values of decoherence can thus be traced back to the basic concepts of coherence and interference between pathways as expressed in the decoherent histories language .",
    "+ while the specific decoherence model used ( haken - strobl ) is an oversimplified description of the actual dynamics taking place in real systems , we believe that our analysis allows to spot out the essential features that may determine the high efficiency of the transport even in more complex system - environment scenarios .",
    "+ in conclusion , the tools introduced in this paper allow to thoroughly assess the coherence properties of quantum evolutions and can be applied to a large variety of quantum systems , the only limits being the restriction to markovian dynamics and the computational efforts required for high dimensional systems .",
