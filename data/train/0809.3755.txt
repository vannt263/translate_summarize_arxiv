    "magnetic reconnection is one of the fundamental physical processes that occur in magnetized plasmas , and manifestations range from laboratory to magnetospheric plasmas , and to solar and astrophysical plasmas .",
    "reconnection has as its main characteristic feature the conversion of magnetic field energy into other forms of energy , and transfer of plasma and magnetic flux between separate flux systems : a re - arrangement of magnetic topology .",
    "this process is associated with phenomena such as heating of the solar corona , solar eruptions , coupling between the solar wind and the terrestrial magnetosphere , substorms in the geomagnetic tail , and on a more speculative level , high - energy phenomena observed in astrophysical systems [ e.g. , see _ priest and forbes _ 2000 ] .",
    "because these phenomena occur in environments of high electrical conductivity , the energy conversion process is usually confined to a small , local region , such as the x - type neutral point , the current sheet , the quasi - separatrix layer , and so on . among these types of magnetic neutral regions ,",
    "the x - point is probably the most basic configuration from which the others could develop .",
    "for example , a current sheet could develop either through the collapse of an x - point [ _ dungey _ 1953 ] or through the severe stretching of the magnetic field around an x - point [ _ forbes and isenberg _ 1991 ] ; and a quasi - separatrix layer [ _ dmoulin et al .",
    "_ 1996 ] might be produced by skewing the magnetic fields on both sides of an x - point .    at the current sheet separating the shocked solar wind and the terrestrial magnetosphere ( the magnetopause ) ,",
    "magnetic reconnection can transfer solar wind momentum and energy into the magnetosphere on the dayside .",
    "figure [ fig : magnetosphere ] displays a schematic of the topological changes that are initiated by magnetic reconnection between solar wind field and terrestrial field on the dayside ( stage 1 )",
    ". reconnected ( or  open \" ) field lines are then dragged by the shocked solar wind flow into the nightside magnetosphere , where they form the tail lobes ( stage 2 ) .",
    "addition of magnetic flux from the dayside to the nightside increases the energy stored in the tail . a thin current sheet forms in the tail and at substorm onset reconnection takes places there ( stage 3 ) , heating plasma and jetting it in bursty fashion both earthward [ _ baumjohann et al .",
    "_ , 1990 ; _ angelopoulos et al .",
    "_ , 1992 ] ( stage 4 ) and tailward ( stage 5 ) at high speeds . on the earthward side",
    ", reconnected field lines rapidly snap back toward the earth due to magnetic tension , constituting a process known as the shrinkage of field lines [ e.g. , see _ vestka et al .",
    "_ 1987 ; _ lin et al . _ 1995a ; _ forbes and acton _ 1996 ; _ lin _ 2004 ; _ reeves et al .",
    "these field lines eventually return to the dayside and replace the eroded magnetic flux .",
    "magnetic reconnection and a general convective cycle , including frontside and nightside reconnections , in the process described above were proposed for the first time by _ dungey _ [ 1961 ] .",
    "later , the substorm model was developed , particularly by _ mcpherron et al . _ [ 1973 ] , _ hones _ [ 1977 ] , and _ mcpherron _ [ 1991 ] .",
    "( see also _ baker et al . _",
    "[ 1996 ] for a more recent review . )",
    "as emerges from the discussions above , the substorm is an explosive energy release and is accompanied by a reconfiguration of the near - tail magnetic field ( dipolarization ) and other phenomena to be discussed later . if the magnetosphere is immersed in a southward - pointing interplanetary magnetic field of long ( many hours ) duration , such as what typically happens during passage of interplanetary coronal mass ejections ( icmes ) , then repetitive substorms [ _ farrugia et al . _",
    "1993a ] occur at intervals of about 23 hours [ _ huang et al .",
    "_ 2003 ] .    the formation and development of a current sheet and/or a quasi - separatrix in the solar magnetic field",
    "is usually associated with solar eruptive processes , including solar flares , eruptive prominences , and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) .",
    "in fact , substorms have been called the flares in the magnetosphere ; i.e. , loosely speaking , due to the similarity and explosive character in the energy conversion processes , substorms may be considered as the magnetospheric counterparts of solar eruptions . as we show below , a comparison of reconnection in the solar and terrestrial contexts reveals many common features .",
    "table [ tbl : va ] lists some important parameters for the solar atmosphere and for the magnetosphere . those for the solar atmosphere can be found in the book by _ priest _ [ 1982 ] , those for the low latitude dayside magnetosphere were taken from the _ in situ _ measurements reported by _",
    "paschmann et al . _",
    "[ 1986 ] , those for the middle distant tail lobe and the plasma sheet are from _ slavin et al . _",
    "[ 1985 ] , and those for the near earth sheet are from _ baumjohann et al . _ [ 1989 ] .",
    "we notice the same orders of magnitude of large @xmath0 and small @xmath1 in the solar corona and in the tail lobes of the magnetosphere , but small @xmath0 and larger @xmath1 in the solar photosphere , in the dayside magnetopause , and in the central plasma sheet in the geomagnetic tail .",
    "those in the central sheet ( e.g. , see _ baumjohann et al . _",
    "[ 1989 ] ) suggest a rapid increase of the reconnection rate when low density , high alfvn speed , lobe field becomes reconnected ( e.g. , _",
    "hesse et al . _ [ 1996 ] )",
    ". however , the corresponding values for the solar counterpart of the geomagnetic tail sheet are not available due to the lack of _ in situ _ measurements in the solar environment .",
    "on the other hand , the low @xmath0 and high @xmath1 in the solar photosphere and in the dayside magnetopause have different consequences that will be discussed shortly .",
    "so even though table [ tbl : va ] indicates some similarities of the current sheet in the magnetosphere to that in the solar corona , the levels of our understanding of the details of magnetic reconnection in the magnetosphere and in the solar corona are very disparate . in the magnetosphere , extensive _ in situ",
    "measurements reveal tremendously rich information of the internal features of the current sheets and the magnetic reconnection processes at the magnetopause ( e.g. , _ rijnbeek et al . _",
    "[ 1989 ] ; _ sonnerup et al . _ [ 1981 ] ; _ phan et al . _",
    "[ 2000 ] ; _ paschmann _ [ 2005 ] ) , and in the magnetotail [ e.g. , _ murata et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; _ baker et al .",
    "nakamura et al .",
    "_ 2006 ] . in the solar corona ,",
    "on the other hand , directly observing the current sheet turns out to be very hard , if not impossible .",
    "difficulties stem from two aspects : the low level of emission from the sheet plasma compared to that of other nearby bright features ( see the introduction of _ ko et al . _",
    "[ 2003 ] for a brief review ) , and the possible thinness of the sheet .",
    "in theory , it has often been stated that the sheet is too thin to be observable since its thickness is believed to be limited by the larmor radius of particles that is only a few tens of meters in the coronal environment [ _ litvinenko _ 1996 ; _ wood and neukirch _ 2005 ; and references therein ] .",
    "another reason that might have discouraged direct observations of the current sheet could be ascribed to the  circuit model \" of eruptions developed by _",
    "martens and kuin _ [ 1989 ] , in which the theoretical current sheet length is short . not until the theoretical works of _ forbes and lin _ [ 2000 ] , _ lin and forbes _ [ 2000 ] , and _ lin _ [ 2002 ] , as well as a series subsequent observational ones [ _ ciaravella et al .",

    "_ 2006 ; _ lin et al .",
    "_ 2007 ] , have we started realizing that a fairly long current sheet could develop in the major eruptive process .    in this work",
    "we undertake a comparison of the reconnection processes in these two environments , putting emphasis on geomagnetic substorms , on the one hand , and solar flares , on the other .",
    "such a comparison consists of two aspects .",
    "first , we look into the detailed internal structures of the reconnecting sheets observed in the geomagnetic environment and in the solar corona ; second , we compare two theoretical mechanisms that may account for the observed features of the reconnecting current sheet .",
    "this brings the known results for magnetic reconnection obtained from the investigations of various communities together , and helps people of different research areas to better understand the work and the progress made by others .",
    "in this part of work , we go through a set of observational results regarding plasmoids ( plasma blobs ) observed in different environments .",
    "the term  plasmoid \" is usually used to describe flowing features in the geomagnetic tail current sheet [ e.g. , see _ murata et al .",
    "_ 1995 and references therein ] .",
    "the term  plasma blob \" , on the other hand , is used for the similar features observed in the cme / flare sheets [ see _ ko et al .",
    "_ 2003 ] . observed morphological features and the possible causative mechanisms suggest that plasma blobs and plasmoids are likely the same object , produced by reconnection .      the existence of the earth s geomagnetic tail and its embedded current sheet was confirmed by extensive _ in situ _ measurements of the magnetic field of the earth at distances greater than 7 earth radii in the 1960s",
    "[ e.g , see _ ness _ 1965 ] , and has been observed hundreds of earth radii from the earth by spacecraft .",
    "the discovery of the neutral sheet in the magnetotail is an important aspect in determining the interaction of the super alfvnic solar wind with the earth s magnetic field .",
    "the dynamics of this sheet may thus play an essential role in geomagnetic phenomena [ _ ness _ 1965 ] .",
    "the geomagnetic tail consists of magnetized plasma in the tail lobes overlaying the plasma sheet , in which the current sheet is embedded separating two oppositely - directed magnetic fields .",
    "the geomagnetic tail results from the flow of the solar wind around the magnetosphere .",
    "reconnection of the magnetospheric and the interplanetary magnetic fields starts on the dayside .",
    "open flux is transferred to the nightside where it is stored during the substorm growth phase until released again to the dayside at the substorm onset ( see also figure [ fig : magnetosphere ] for the cycle ) .",
    "dayside reconnection may be quasi - steady [ e.g. , _ sonnerup et al . _ 1981 ] or time - dependent .",
    "the latter form was discovered by _",
    "russell and elphic _ [ 1978 ] at about the same time as observational evidence was being shown for steady reconnection .",
    "time dependent reconnection features on the dayside are known as flux transfer events ( ftes ) .",
    "these are tied to various signatures , chief among these is a bipolar variation lasting 1 - 2 min of the magnetic field component normal to the magnetopause ( see reviews by _ elphic _ [ 1995 ] and _ farrugia et al . _ [ 1988 ] ) .",
    "the low @xmath0 and high @xmath1 in this region ( see table [ tbl : va ] ) imposes restrictions on the rate of magnetic reconnection and thus the energy conversion .",
    "so particle acceleration and plasma heating at the dayside magnetopause are not as obvious as in the tail region _",
    "instead reconnection here primarily leads to the storage of magnetic reconnection converted from the solar wind kinetic energy ( see figure [ fig : magnetosphere ] ) .",
    "as indicated by figure [ fig : magnetosphere ] , after reconnection on the dayside open field lines are dragged to the nightside forming the tail lobes .",
    "this results in a considerable increase in the energy stored in the tail . to balance the dayside reconnection during relatively quiet times",
    ", nightside reconnection is needed , which is assumed to take place in the far tail forming the quiet time plasma sheet . during the rapid accretion of magnetic energy in the tail lobe during disturbed conditions",
    ", however , the plasma sheet closer to earth ( at @xmath2 @xmath3 ) becomes thinner .",
    "when it becomes sufficiently thin , a near - earth neutral line is created . at the neutral line plasma",
    "is heated and jets in both earthward and tailward directions . in earthward direction ,",
    "closer to the earth than the neutral sheet the field lines become more dipolar through magnetic tension , injecting energetic particles near local midnight in the process .",
    "strong auroral effects are produced at the magnetic footprints of these field lines ( e.g. _ sergeev et al . _ [ 1999 ] ; _ sandholt et al . _",
    "[ 2001 ] ) ; and in the tailward direction , a  magnetic island \" or plasmoid is propelled at high speeds .    the term  plasmoid \"",
    "was first introduced by _ hones et al . _",
    "[ 1977 ] who took it from the laboratory literature where the pulse of plasma emitted into a chamber to conduct experiments was termed a plasmoid .",
    "magnetotail plasmoids as regions of typically reduced magnetic field strength ( except when they contain a strong core field ) , surrounded by a traveling compression region , were discovered in the isee data in the mid-1980s [ _ hones et al .",
    "_ 1984 ; _ slavin et al .",
    "they are large ( about tens of @xmath4 ) closed magnetic loops which propagate rapidly downtail during a substorm event [ _ hones et al .",
    "_ slavin et al . _ [ 1984 ] described traveling convection regions observed by isee in the distant tail consequent upon substorm activity nearer earth and identified them as lobe signatures of plasmoids traveling at a few 10@xmath5 km s@xmath6 downtail .",
    "the release of plasmoids in the near - earth tail at substorm expansion phase was inferred by _",
    "hones _ [ 1979 ] .",
    "features of the distant neutral line ( dnl ) are also summarized in figure [ fig : magnetosphere ] .",
    "the dnl was first demonstrated with actual measurements from isee 3 by slavin et al .",
    "it was then examined in a series of further studies using geotail data by _",
    "nishida et al . _",
    "[ 1994 ; 1998 ; and references therein ] .",
    "reconnection at the dnl appears relatively continuous and moderate in terms of its outflow speed , perhaps due to the fact that the lobes are filled with diffuse plasma by @xmath7 ( gsm ) @xmath8 from the  mantle \" that lowers the alfvn speed .",
    "magnetic island structures in the magnetotail have been frequently detected by _ in situ _ measurements either by direct encounter or by remote sensing the perturbations they excite in the surrounding field and plasma [ _ slavin et al .",
    "_ 1984 ] during geomagnetic substorms , and the flow speed could be as high as several hundreds of km / s [ _ ho and tsurutani _ 1997 ] .",

    "slavin et al . _ [ 2003 ] ; _ slavin et al . _",
    "[ 2005 ] ; and _ eastwood et al . _ [ 2005 ] ) based on the observations made by the four cluster spacecrafts confirmed the magnetic island structure inside the current sheet .",
    "these observations indicated the occurrence of the multiple x - line reconnection in the magnetotail proposed by _ lee and fu _ [ 1985 ] and _ fu and lee _ [ 1985 ] .",
    "these authors found plasmoid features moving both earthward and tailward , and argued that they are the products of the multiple x - line reconnection .",
    "the rate of reconnection at each x - line is not necessarily the same . instead",
    ", one of these x - lines becomes dominant where the fastest reconnection takes place .",
    "_ eastwood et al . _ [ 2005 ] pointed out that although numerical and experimental evidence had been observed to suggest the filamentation of the current sheet and multiple x - line reconnection , the data from cluster and related investigations presented the observational evidence of the relevant features in the magnetotail for the first time . on the other hand ,",
    "what determines the location of the dominant x - line is unknown .",
    "it probably depends on the adjacent magnetic field and the plasma environment .",
    "some other interesting characteristics of plasmoids are that plasmoids observed to move tailward are more than those moving earthward [ _ moldwin and hughes _ 1991 ] , and that the tailward motion is faster than the earthward motion [ _ slavin et al .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that the earthward flow is deflected and stopped near the cusp point by the closed magnetic field lines near the earth , as described by _",
    "reeves et al . _",
    "[ 2008 ] in a recent work related to the present one .",
    "because of mathematical complexity , the behavior of the plasmoid approaching the cusp region was tentatively studied via the analytic approach in only two works so far [ i.e. , _ semenov and lebedeva _ 1991 ; _ lin et al .",
    "_ 1995b ] , and no numerical experiment focusing on the behavior of the plasmoid near that area has yet been reported .",
    "another important consequence of reconnection is the generation of fast plasma flows , which for a long time have been used as the major indicator of the occurrence of reconnection and for the identification of the location of the reconnection site . on the dayside ,",
    "accelerated plasma flows have been extensively used to infer the presence of reconnection [ see _ paschmann et al . _ 1979 ; _ sonnerup et al . _ 1981 ] in view of the difficulty in showing a non - zero normal component . in the tail , bulk plasma acceleration associated with the formation of the slow mode shock that has been identified ( e.g. , see _ feldman et al . _",
    "[ 1984 ] ; _ ieroset et al . _",
    "[ 2000 ] ; and _ sonnerup et al . _",
    "[ 1987 ] ) implicitly suggests that the petschek - type reconnection is in operation .",
    "large - scale hybrid simulations of the magnetotail undergoing reconnection were conducted , and significance of the slow mode shocks was confirmed [ _ krauss - varban and omidi _ 1995 ] .",
    "but in the quasi - steady state framework , not all the observed and simulated features , such as the slow mode shock , gave a coherent and consistent picture [ _ feldman et al .",
    "_ 1985 ; _ krauss - varban and omidi _ 1995 ] .",
    "from this time - dependent properties of reconnection process in reality may be inferred [ e.g. , _ pudovkin and semenov _ 1985 ] .",
    "there are two solar counterparts of the geomagnetic tail : one is the current sheet that extends from the top of flare loops and connects to the associated cme ( e.g. , see _ lin et al . _",
    "[ 2004 ] ) ; and another one is embedded in the  helmet streamers \" .",
    "similarities of these two objects in morphology can be seen from both observations ( e.g. , see _ priest _ [ 1982 ] ) and numerical experiments ( e.g. , see _ birn et al . _ [ 2003 ] ) .",
    "the current sheet configuration related to flares and cmes can not exist for long , and is created presumably by the disrupting magnetic field as a result of the loss of equilibrium in the system ( e.g. , see _ forbes and isenberg _ [ 1991 ] ; _ forbes _ [ 2000 and 2007 ] ; and references therein ) .",
    "such a scenario was suggested for the first time by _ carmichael _ [ 1964 ] , and was later developed into the well - known kopp - pneuman model [ _ kopp and pneuman _ 1976 ] , or more generally , the cshkp model [ e.g. , see _ vestka and cliver _ 1992 ] ( see figure [ fig : kopp - pneuman ] ) .",
    "it was further developed by _",
    "martens and kuin _ [ 1989 ] and _ lin and forbes _ [ 2000 ] to the catastrophe model of the solar eruption in which the eruptive prominence evolves into the cme connecting to the associated flare below by a long current sheet ( see figure [ fig : cme - flare ] , and also _ lin et al . _",
    "[ 2003 ] for other models ) .    in this model , continuous mass motions and magnetic reconnection in the photosphere",
    "successively displace the footpoints of the coronal magnetic field , changes the shape of the field , converts the kinetic energy of mass motions into the magnetic energy and transports it into the corona .",
    "the low @xmath0 and high @xmath1 in the photosphere limits the rate of magnetic reconnection there such that no apparent heating and acceleration of plasma takes place ( refer to table [ tbl : va ] ) .",
    "instead the magnetic reconnection in the photosphere plays the role in transporting magnetic flux only .",
    "here we note , again , the process of converting the kinetic energy from the low @xmath0 and high @xmath1 region ( the photosphere ) into magnetic energy stored in the high @xmath0 and low @xmath1 region ( the corona ) .",
    "eventually , when the stored energy in the corona exceeds the threshold , the magnetic field loses the equilibrium and disrupts .",
    "magnetic field lines are severely stretched to form an effectively open magnetic configuration including a neutral sheet separating magnetic fields of opposite polarity .",
    "magnetic reconnection occurring inside the current sheet creates the growing flare loops in the corona and the separating flare loops on the solar disk ( e.g. , see _ forbes _ [ 2000 ] ; _ klimchuk _ [ 2001 ] ; _ priest and forbes _ [ 2002 ] ; _ lin et al . _",
    "[ 2003 ] ; _ birn et al . _",
    "[ 2003 and 2006 ] ; _ forbes _ [ 2007 ] , and figure [ fig : cme - flare ] as well ) .",
    "when magnetic reconnection occurs in this current sheet , the high @xmath0 and low @xmath1 in the corona determines that the stored magnetic energy is released in a violent fashion .",
    "because the current sheet associated with flare and cme can only form and exist in the eruptive process , continuous reconnection analogous to that occurring at dnl in the earth s tail ceases as the eruption ends .",
    "a typical eruptive process usually lasts tens of hours ( e.g. , see _ vestka and cliver _ [ 1992 ] ) , which may also be the lifetime of the corresponding continuous reconnection .",
    "the current sheet in the helmet streamer , on the other hand , can last much longer .",
    "the helmet streamer is the huge , long - lived , radially oriented structure that extends from the base of the corona out to several solar radii ( e.g. , see _ aschwanden _ [ 2005 ] , p. 9 ) .",
    "the lower part of it contains closed magnetic field spanning over a magnetic neutral line on the solar surface , while the upper part turns into an open magnetic field joining the closed one in the region of the cusp - geometry from which the gas pressure starts to exceed the magnetic pressure outward .",
    "the long - lived property of the helmet streamer allows magnetic reconnection in the sheet to continue for a while analogous to that in the earth s tail .",
    "the helmet streamers will be discussed in the next section , and in this section we focus here on the cme / flare current sheet .",
    "recent research indicates that the closed magnetic field does not necessarily become fully open as the kopp - pneuman - type eruption occurs . instead ,",
    "the magnetic structure is severely stretched and a current sheet forms [ e.g. , _ lin and forbes _ 2000 ; _ forbes and lin _ 2000 ] . with dissipation in the current sheet ,",
    "the stretched magnetic field starts to reconnect , producing new closed field lines both below and above the current sheet [ _ lin et al .",
    "_ 2004 ] , so the pre - existing closed magnetic field never becomes fully open ( see figure [ fig : cme - flare ] ) .",

    "we also note that the term  flux rope \" often appears in the literature of geophysics as well ( e.g. _ slavin et al . _ [ 1995 ] ) .",
    "the relevant structure is very similar to that of plasmoid flowing inside the geomagnetic tail , but _ sibeck et al . _",

    "these observations provide strong evidence for the idea that the majority of the slow wind originates along the open - field edges of streamers .",
    "however , evidence also exists for a time - variable plasmoid - like component of the slow wind in streamers . the increased photon sensitivity of the lasco / soho white - light coronagraph over earlier instruments revealed an almost continual release of low - contrast density inhomogeneities , or `` blobs , '' from the cusps of streamers [ _ sheeley et al .",
    "these features appear to accelerate to velocities of order 300 to 400 km s@xmath6 by the time they reach @xmath1730 @xmath13 , the outer limit of lasco s field of view . because of their low contrast , though ( i.e. , they represent only about 10% changes from the time - averaged streamer ) , the blobs probably do not comprise a large fraction of the mass flux of the slow solar wind .    _ wang et al . _ [ 2000 ] reviewed three general scenarios for the production of these blobs : ( 1 ) `` streamer evaporation '' as the loop - tops ( with plasma @xmath21 ) are heated to the point where magnetic tension is overcome by high gas pressure ; ( 2 ) plasmoid formation as the distended streamer cusp pinches off the gas above an x - type neutral point ; and ( 3 ) reconnection between one leg of the streamer and an adjacent open field line , transferring some of the trapped plasma from the former to the latter and allowing it to escape [ see figure 8 of _ wang et al . _",

    ".    there may be some similarity between these scenarios and older models of diamagnetic acceleration of the solar wind via buoyant plasmoids that may fill some fraction of the corona [ e.g. , _ schlter _ 1957 ; _ pneuman _ 1986 ; _ mullan _ 1990 ] . the additional momentum deposited by this process",

    "there is a self - adjustment between the large scale field and plasma flow distribution and the reconnection rate , so the evolutionary behavior of the hydromagnetic configuration is ultimately governed both by the globally imposed boundary conditions and the local processes occurring inside the diffusion region , which is described by the time - dependent alfvn mach number @xmath62 .    as examples , we study the response of the medium to the following two time profiles of @xmath42 : @xmath63 and @xmath64 , \\label{eq : ma_mp}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is in units of @xmath66 .",

    "the disturbance commences at the origin ( namely the diffusion region marked with asterisk ) as @xmath68 , and propagates at the local alfvn speed , which is larger than the slow magnetoacoustic speed , so the slow mode shock forms in front of the propagating disturbance ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "collectively , these slow shocks establish an outflow region for plasma and magnetic field streaming along the current sheet .",

    "it represents some important features of the multiple x - line reconnection process as well .",
    "we note that we use the single pulse reconnection here as an example to demonstrate how the impact of the magnetic diffusion occurring in a local region could cause disturbance and energy conversion in the medium at large .",
    "but it may not be the fashion in which magnetic reconnection takes place in reality . instead",
    ", bursty reconnection is more likely to occur in both solar and magnetospheric environments .",
    "the most significant consequence of introducing the slow mode shocks attached to the diffusion region is the tremendous enhancement of the energy conversion rate , or the rate of magnetic reconnection since the slow mode shock is also known as a switch - off shock through which the downstream tangential magnetic field is almost switched off , and the corresponding magnetic energy is converted into heating and kinetic energy of the reconnected plasma [ _ priest _ 1982 ] .",
    "the density , the pressure , and the temperature of the reconnected plasma in the outflow region increase by a factor of @xmath73 @xmath74 respectively , with @xmath75 being the ratio of specific heats and @xmath1 being the plasma beta ( e.g. , see _ pudovkin and semenov _ [ 1985 ] ) .",

    "@xmath80 and @xmath79 are obtained by taking averages of @xmath62 over the time domain and of the shock extension over the space domain in @xmath7-direction ( see figure [ fig : td_petschek ] ) , respectively , with keeping the fact in mind that the medium upstream of the shock remains unperturbed before the shock arrives .",
    "forms of those equations used to deduce [ eq : average ] are simple and the algebra performed are straightforward , so we do not duplicate them here and skip the algebra .",
    "similar to ( [ eq : l_min ] ) , equation ( [ eq : average ] ) relates several important parameters for magnetic reconnection to one another , and these parameters are all observables .",
    "such relations provide us opportunities to look into some crucial properties of energy conversion through magnetic reconnection in either the magnetosphere or the solar corona , and may help tell what type of reconnection is occurring or has occurred by comparing theories and observations .",
    "we notice the similarity of equation ( [ eq : average ] ) to ( [ eq : l_min ] ) in that @xmath28 is related to @xmath46 linearly although these two equations are deduced in different frameworks . such as similarity",
    "is quite likely to suggest a kind of equivalence in physics of the two frameworks in which the reconnection process is studied .",
    "this is probably because both turbulent eddies and shocks act as diffusion structures which play an important role in converting energy from one form into another .",
    "if we enlarge the fine structures of the turbulent current sheet , we may find that each magnetic island - neutral point - magnetic island structure inside the turbulent current sheet in figure [ fig : tearing ] can be seen as a petschek - type reconnection morphology displayed in figure [ fig : td_petschek ] in small scale , and a turbulent sheet should be full of numerous such small scale structures [ see _ drake et al .",

    "in fact , both the turbulence and the petschek versions of reconnection were used to explain the same results of a numerical experiment . in their original work on the numerical simulation of magnetic reconnection occurring in the current sheet extending from the top of the flare loop system , _ forbes and malherbe _ [ 1991 ] identified the plasma blobs appearing in the sheet with the magnetic islands caused by the tearing mode .",

    "furthermore , this might suggest that both versions of reconnection operate together in the eruptive event in reality . at present",
    "this issue requires further investigations .",
    "in addition , multiple x - line reconnection may occur in a different fashion .",
    "numerical investigations of the plasma dynamics of a long magnetotail ( @xmath82 ) indicated that the formation of x - line and plasmoids occurs intermittently and repeatedly every 2  4 hours [ _ lee et al . _ 1985 ] , and reconnection in the magnetotail during substorms and storms is basically a driven process .",
    "these results are consistent with some observations made in the magnetotail .",
    "the force driving reconnection is governed by the environment and manifests time - dependent features , which may account for the time profile of @xmath42 discussed above .",
    "the formation and evolution of a three - dimensional plasmoid in the geomagnetic tail was numerically studied by _",
    "hesse and birn _ [ 1991 ] .",
    "the configuration investigated includes the transition from a closed field line region to an open far - tail region with a distant x - line .",
    "they found that the formation and growth of a plasmoid body through reconnection occurs in the near - earth region , and helical plasmoid field lines are produced but remain connected to the earth .",
    "besides the phenomena in the magnetotail , the multiple x - line reconnection may also result in fte s observed by isee satellites at the dayside magnetopause [ _ lee and fu _ 1985 ] .",
    "existence of the skew components of the reconnected field lines allows the formation of the flux rope consisting of the helical field lines . in this model the magnetic island is not isolated but is part of an interconnected chain of two - dimensional x - points and o - points .",
    "further studies showed that the occurrence of the multiple x - line reconnection is governed by the current sheet scales [ _ fu and lee _ 1985 ] .",
    "this process is expected to happen when the sheet length is large compared to its thickness and the resistivity is low . _",
    "lee and fu _ [ 1986 ] found as the ratio @xmath83 exceeds a critical value between 10 and 20 , multiple x - lines are observed to appear in the current sheet .",
    "_ lee _ [ 1990 ] noted that with the formation of a long current sheet in the magnetopause , the non - uniformity of the solar wind pressure and the stress of interplanetary magnetic flux exerted on the magnetopause surface may also cause variations in the current density and , consequently , reconnection to occur at several locations .",
    "associated with the successive appearance of multiple x - lines and plasmoids is bursty reconnection rate or electric field [ _ lee et al .",
    "_ 1990 ] , which resembles that shown in figure [ fig : ma]@xmath19 .",
    "as we already mentioned before , features of multiple x - line reconnection have also been recognized in both magnetotail substorms [ _ slavin et al .",
    "_ 2003 and 2005 ] and solar eruptive events [ _ ko et al . _ 2003 ; _ lin et al .",
    "_ 2005 ] , as well as in the numerical experiments for solar eruptions [ _ riley et al .",
    "_ 2007 ] .    before ending this section ,",
    "we believe it is also worth mentioning the work by _ lazarian and vishniac _ [ 1999 ] who studied the role of the stochastic features in the current sheet through a different approach . in this version of energy conversion ,",
    "magnetic field dissipation starts with ohmic diffusion .",
    "then , stochastic components of the magnetic field are produced in the initial stage . with the occurrence of stochastic components ,",
    "there is small - scale  wandering \" in the field lines .",
    "this allows magnetic reconnection to take place among adjacent wandering field lines ( see figure 2 of _ lazarian and vishniac _ [ 1999 ] ) , yielding multiple reconnection sites within the sheet .",
    "the presence of multiple reconnection sites results in a minimum rate of reconnection , @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the magnetic reynolds number in the whole system involved in the energy conversion . in the solar coronal",
    "@xmath85 ranges from @xmath86 to @xmath87 , which brings the minimum of @xmath42 to @xmath88 that is within the range of the observed values that we have known so far .",
    "in this work we have engaged in a comparative study of the reconnection process in the solar and terrestrial contexts .",
    "properties of the magnetized plasma determines that the rate of reconnection in both environments is controlled by the local alfvn speed .",
    "this further yields that the reconnection process in the low @xmath0 and high @xmath1 region transports magnetic flux and energy to the region of high @xmath0 and low @xmath1 gradually , and that reconnection in the high @xmath0 and low @xmath1 region releases the stored magnetic energy violently .",
    "this may explain why the consequences occurring in the photosphere and in the dayside magnetopause ( low @xmath0 and high @xmath1 ) are much less significant than those occurring in the corona ( flares and cmes ) and in the magnetotail ( substorms ) ( high @xmath0 and low @xmath1 ) .",
    "of course , because of the huge difference in scale length and magnetic field strength , the absolute amount of energy conversion and the absolute rate of reconnection ( usually measured by the strength of reconnection electric field along the x - line ) in the solar and terrestrial contexts could greatly differ from one another .",
    "for example , a typical solar eruption involves energy release of up to 10@xmath89 ergs ( e.g. , see _ priest _ [ 1982 ] ) and the absolute reconnection rate typical varies from 1 v / cm to 10 v / cm ( e.g. , see _ poletto and kopp _ [ 1986 ] and _ qiu et al . _ [ 2004 ] ) , and a typical substorm releases energy of only @xmath90 ergs [ _ baker et al .",
    "_ 1997 ] and the absolute reconnection rate of 1 @xmath17 10 mv / m ( e.g. , see _",
    "blanchard et al . _",
    "[ 1997 ] and _ vaivads et al .",
    "_ [ 2006 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the rate of reconnection is also often measured by the alfvn mach number @xmath42 , which is the reconnection inflow speed @xmath38 compared to the local alfvn speed @xmath0 near the reconnection region .",
    "so @xmath42 is known as the relative reconnection rate as well ( e.g. , see discussions of _ lin and forbes _ [ 2000 ] and _ priest and forbes _",
    "[ 2000 ] ) . in this sense",
    ", @xmath42 is within the same order of magnitudes between 0.01 and 0.1 for the reconnection processes in both solar and magnetospheric environments ( cf .",
    "_ ko et al . _ [ 2003 ] , _ lin et al . _ [ 2005 ] and _ vaivads et al . _ [ 2006 ] ) although the absolute rates of reconnection in the two environments are vastly different .",
    "this result should help us study and well understand the similar energy conversion processes taking place on other objects in the universe .",
    "another emphasis related to reconnection has been the formation of plasmoids / plasma blobs in both environments .",
    "the magnetic reconnection process manifests almost the same features in various different magnetized plasma environments , including the solar corona and the magnetosphere .",
    "usually flows are observed in two opposite directions along the sheet in both the magnetotail and the cme / flare sheet , and only the antisunward flow is observed in the helmet streamer .",
    "this is probably because the reconnection in the helmet streamer is weaker and the sunward reconnection outflow is easily stopped by the closed loops below .",
    "plasmoids or plasma blobs flowing along the reconnecting current sheet are the ubiquitous features observed in these environments although mechanisms for the formation the current sheet vary from case to case .    these plasmoids are usually ascribed to multiple x - line reconnection as a result of the tearing mode instability developing in a long thin current sheet ( e.g. , see _ furth et al . _",
    "[ 1963 ] and _ priest _ [ 1985 ] for the review ; and _ drake et al . _ [ 2006 ] and _ loureiro et al . _ [ 2007 ] for the most recent works on this topic ) .",
    "reconnection occurs at each of these x - lines , but one of them eventually develops to become the dominant one at which the fastest reconnection takes place , and its high speed flow expels both plasmoids and other x - lines to move in two opposite directions .",
    "the mechanism determining the location of this dominant x - line is an open question , but it should depend on the parameters of the plasma and magnetic field around .    an alternative process that may account for the plasmoid feature is time - dependent petschek - type reconnection extensively studied by semenov and his co - authors . in this framework ,",
    "diffusion initially commences somewhere in a pre - existing current sheet where a finite electrical resistivity appears .",
    "the impact caused by the diffusion is not confined to the diffusion region but propagates as a disturbance at the local alfvn speed to the medium at large .",
    "determined by the time profile of the diffusion , the disturbance propagates along the current sheet with two pairs of the slow mode shocks surrounding the reconnected plasma and magnetic field in the outflow region .",
    "departing from the diffusion region , the two pairs of the slow shock and the associated plasma flows propagate in opposite direction . in this case",
    ", multiple x - lines and blobs may appear alternatively along the sheet , but the dissipation just occurs only at the slow shocks and the x - line where the initial diffusion commences . such a treatment applied by semenov and his co - workers is based on considerations of mathematical simplicity in order to find analytic solutions to the problem .",
    "this scenario is quite like that of the multiple x - line reconnection due to the tearing mode in the stage when one x - line eventually becomes dominant and two reconnection outflows in opposite direction emanate from it .",
    "one difference is that the dissipation occurs everywhere in the sheet undergoing tearing , and the dominant x - line develops in a self - consistent fashion from many x - lines during the process ( e.g. , see _ fu and lee _ [ 1985 ] ) .",
    "but the dominant x - line in the petschek - type reconnection is fixed artificially from the very beginning .",
    "another difference comes from our understanding of the dissipation mechanisms in the process . in the tearing mode version ,",
    "the dissipation occurs in the whole current sheet as a result of the plasma turbulence caused by the instability . in the petschek version ,",
    "on the other hand , in addition to the diffusion region , the slow shocks play the main role in the energy conversion .",
    "these two approaches should be physically equivalent . comparing the arguments and discussions of _ forbes and malherbe _ [ 1991 ] and _ priest and forbes _",
    "[ 2000 , pp .",
    "391393 ] on the same results from the numerical experiment of reconnection in the two - ribbon flare process seems to be suggestive of such an equivalence .",
    "but rigorous studies of this equivalence are not yet available due to mathematical difficulties .",
    "in addition to the interior structure of the reconnecting current sheets , it is also necessary to pay attention to the environment outside the sheet and its possible impacts on the energy conversion process . in discussions of magnetotail versus",
    "corona reconnection , one topic that has come up repeatedly is whether there is any evidence for the strong increases in alfvn speed at the sun as one moves normal to the reconnecting sheet .",
    "the gradients are large in the earth s tail with alfvn speeds of @xmath91 km s@xmath6 in the central plasma sheet where reconnection commences , but increasing to @xmath92 km s@xmath6 over 100 to 1000 km distant in the outer plasma sheet and lobes .",
    "this strong gradient is believed to be the source of the  explosive \" appearance of magnetotail reconnection as first the low alfvn speed flux tubes in the central plasma sheet reconnect followed later by the high alfvn speed lobe flux tubes ( e.g. , see _ hesse et al . _",
    "[ 1996 ] ) .    in principle ,",
    "fast reconnection in the solar corona also occurs during the explosive event , like flares , in the current sheet where a large gradient of alfvn speed exists in the direction normal to the sheet .",
    "this is represented indirectly by the dramatic change in plasma @xmath1 from well below unity outside the sheet to around unity inside the sheet ( e.g. , see _ ko et al . _ [ 2003 ] ) , and by the significant difference between the inflow and the outflow speeds of the plasma measured around the sheet developed in an eruption ( e.g. , see _ lin et al . _ [ 2005 ] ) .",
    "unlike the geomagnetic tail sheet in the  explosive \" stage , however , the coronal sheet in the  explosive \" phase does not exist beforehand , but forms and develops during the eruptive process .",
    "so the strong gradient of the alfvn speed across the cme / flare sheet is not the very source of the  explosive \" appearance of reconnection .",
    "instead the cme / flare current sheet forms as the closed magnetic field is severely stretched by the eruption , separating magnetic field lines of opposite polarity , and the temporal vacuum around the sheet quickly brings these field lines and plasma into the sheet driving reconnection to occur ( e.g. , see _ lin et al . _",
    "[ 2003 ] ) . in this process",
    "it is not necessarily the magnetic field of the low alfvn speed that reconnects before that of high alfvn speed .",
    "but it is true that the alfvn speed inside the sheet is low compared to that outside ( e.g. , see _ forbes and malherbe _ [ 1991 ] ) .",
    "as an efficient energy conversion process in magnetized plasma environments , magnetic reconnection takes place in the solar atmosphere , magnetosphere , laboratory plasmas , and in other astrophysical contexts .",
    "here we have emphasized the solar and magnetospheric context because , so far , these are the only two places where the magnetic reconnection process on the large scale can be observed or detected directly . we compared their morphological features and physical properties , discussed the reconnection process as a means of energy conversion and detailed the observational consequences .",
    "this comparative study reveals several pieces of important information that help us understand the physics related to the large scale energy conversion and release processes that may occur in the magnetized plasma environments on other objects in the universe .",
    "\\1 . in both solar atmosphere and magnetosphere",
    ", reconnection slowly sends the magnetic flux and energy from the region of low @xmath0 and high @xmath1 to that of high @xmath0 and low @xmath1 , then the magnetic energy stored in the latter is quickly released by reconnection causing violent eruptions .",
    "energy conversion through magnetic reconnection in both environments takes place in current sheets .",
    "these sheets form as a result of the interaction between the solar wind and the geomagnetic field in the magnetosphere , in one case ; and in the corona , they develop when the closed magnetic field lines are stretched by the eruption .",
    "reconnection takes place in the current sheet when the sheet becomes thin enough . in the earth",
    "s magnetotail , measurements by geotail and cluster indicate that reconnection does not take place until the sheet has thinned to the point where not only the ions have become  demagnetized \" , but embedded electron scale effects become important to provide the necessary dissipation as well . in the solar cme / flare , it was also shown that reconnection commenced when two magnetic fields of opposite polarity were pushed against each other , which implies that the sheet between the two fields got thinned ( e.g. , see _ lin et al . _ [ 2005 ] ) . at present , it is not clear how thin the sheet should be , but it is usually believed that reconnection begins as a result of the tearing mode when the sheet length exceeds @xmath93 times its thickness ( e.g. , see _ furth et al . _ 1963 ; _ priest and forbes _ [ 2000 ] ) .",
    "huge difference between the two contexts in length scale and in magnetic field strength yields significant difference between them in the absolute values of both amount and rate of energy release during eruptions .",
    "but if we consider a dimensionless energy release rate , @xmath42 , namely the relative rate of reconnection , then we found that the eruptive processes in the different environments typically take place at the same rate .",
    "this implies that the energy conversion via reconnection on other objects in the universe are quite likely to occur at the same @xmath42 as on the sun and on the earth .",
    "the most magnificent morphological features observed ( detected ) in the solar eruption ( substorms ) are the plasma blobs ( plasmoids ) flowing along the respective reconnecting current sheets .",
    "the flow of the blob observed in several solar eruptions was identified with the reconnection outflow , and was used to deduce the alfvn speed in the corona .",
    "the blob flows in both directions are well observed , but those propagating away from the sun in solar eruptions and tailward in substorms can be recognized more easily than those towards the sun and the earth .",
    "the closed field lines below the current sheet produced by magnetic reconnection is the reason responsible for such a discrimination of the plasma flow behaviors in both contexts .",
    "plasma blobs or plasmoids could be identified with either the magnetic islands caused by the tearing mode instability ( turbulence ) or the reconnection outflow regions surrounded by the slow mode shocks in the petschek - type reconnection process . in both cases ,",
    "magnetic reconnection dissipates the magnetic field in a fairly efficient fashion .",
    "the high efficiency of the energy conversion results from the hyper - resistivity in the former case , and from the slow mode shocks in the latter case .",

    "<S> magnetic reconnection plays a crucial role in violent energy conversion occurring in the environments of high electrical conductivity , such as the solar atmosphere , magnetosphere , and fusion devices . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the morphological features of the process in two different environments , the solar atmosphere and the geomagnetic tail . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to indirect evidence that indicates reconnection in progress or having just taken place , such as auroral manifestations in the magnetosphere and the flare loop system in the solar atmosphere , more direct evidence of reconnection in the solar and terrestrial environments is being collected . </S>",
    "<S> such evidence includes the reconnection inflow near the reconnecting current sheet , and the outflow along the sheet characterized by a sequence of plasmoids . </S>",
    "<S> both turbulent and unsteady petschek - type reconnection processes could account for the observations . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss other relevant observational consequences of both mechanisms in these two settings . </S>",
    "<S> while on face value , these are two completely different physical environments , there emerge many commonalities , for example , an alfvn speed of the same order of magnitude , a key parameter determining the reconnection rate . </S>",
    "<S> this comparative study is meant as a contribution to current efforts aimed at isolating similarities in processes occurring in very different contexts in the heliosphere , and even in the universe . </S>"
