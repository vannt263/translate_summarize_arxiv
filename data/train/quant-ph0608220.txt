    "the concept of entanglement between two systems dates back to the birth of quantum mechanics  @xcite . in a certain sense",
    ", entanglement can be associated with the counterintuitive nonlocal behavior of two quantum systems : namely , the appearance of nonlocal correlations between them even after their mutual interaction is switched off .",
    "such a feature has puzzled our minds , and explorations of that concept have opened new fields of research such as quantum computation and quantum information  @xcite . in particular , many useful quantum communication protocols such as superdense coding  @xcite , teleportation  @xcite , and quantum state sharing  @xcite require entangled states ( quantum channels ) as a key ingredient for their successful implementation .    in view of that",
    ", the search for physical systems where entangled states can be found turned to be of utmost importance not only for academic reasons , but also for practical implementation of the new technology arising from these new fields of research .",
    "promising physical systems in which entanglement may be abundant are quantum spin chains . for a long time",
    "one has intensively studied such systems mainly because of their interesting magnetic properties .",
    "therefore , a great amount of knowledge about the physics of such many - body systems was obtained , paving the way to an investigation of the entanglement properties of spin chains  @xcite . a fruitful result of this investigation , for example , is the discovery of the role of entanglement in quantum phase transitions . at the critical point , it is known that the bipartite entanglement entropy  @xcite of the ground state diverges logarithmically with the size of the subsystem .",
    "in addition to this , it was shown that the bipartite entanglement is proportional to a quantity called central charge , which dictates the conformal field theory universality class of the chain  @xcite .",
    "almost all previous studies dealt with ordered spin chains .",
    "recently , nevertheless , it was shown that the bipartite entanglement of a random antiferromagnetic ( af ) heisenberg spin-1/2 chain also grows logarithmically with the size of the subsystem  @xcite .",
    "a similar result was also derived for a random transverse - field ising chain at the critical point . in both cases",
    "the ` effective ' central charge is less than the one calculated for their clean and ordered counterparts  @xcite . in other words ,",
    "bipartite entanglement entropy is decreased when disorder is added into the system . in view of such a result",
    ", one may naively think that disorder is an undesired feature in spin chains when one is concerned with implementation of any quantum information protocol . here",
    "we show , interestingly , that disorder provides a ground state with remarkable entanglement properties which can be properly harnessed to create almost maximally entangled bell states , the ultimate quantum channel needed in many quantum communication protocols .    in this work we study the entanglement properties of long - distance pairs of qubits in the random af spin-1/2 chain .",
    "for that purpose we determine for some suitable pairs in the chain how close they are to a bell state ; i.e. , we compute the fidelity of those pairs with a singlet .",
    "in addition , we exhaustively characterize their entanglement properties computing their negativity  @xcite , logarithmic negativity  @xcite , and concurrence  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we relate all these quantities to each other .",
    "we show that some rare pairs display strikingly high fidelities , qualifying them as good quantum channels .",
    "finally , we show that the fidelity distribution of such rare pairs does not depend on the size of the chain and is proportional only to the disorder strength .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : we introduce the model , compute the fidelity , and relate it to the negativity , logarithmic negativity , and concurrence in sec .",
    "[ sec : the - model ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical - results ] , we present our numerical data , quantifying the interesting pairwise entanglement properties of the disordered system , and compare it with the ordered and clean ones . finally , we conclude and discuss the relevance of our results in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we introduce the model and compute its pairwise entanglement as a function of the spin - spin correlation functions .",
    "our starting point is the random xxz af spin-1/2 chain whose hamiltonian reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the usual spin-1/2 operator related to site @xmath2 and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are independent random variables . in all the following calculations we use @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "however , we first argue that our results are valid for all models satisfying the condition @xmath7 .",
    "it was shown that weak anisotropy ( @xmath8 ) renormalizes to zero in the low - energy limit , being thus irrelevant  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the isotropic point @xmath9 , @xmath6 , is governed by the same infinite - randomness fixed point ( irfp ) that governs the point @xmath5 ; i.e. , those systems quantitatively share the same long - length ground state properties  @xcite . thus ,",
    "from now on it is sufficient to consider only the case where @xmath5 .",
    "this choice allows us to map the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) to a free fermion one through a jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "then , we can exactly diagonalize large chains using standard subroutines  @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of the clean counterpart of this system ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) is well known  @xcite . for @xmath12",
    "the system is a critical tomonaga - luttinger spin liquid  @xcite . for @xmath13 ,",
    "a spin gap opens and the system belongs to the ising antiferromagnet universality class , and for @xmath14 the system is in the gapless ising ferromagnet universality class . in the critical regime",
    ", the spin - spin correlation function decays as a power law with well - known exponents  @xcite and conjectured - exact amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it was shown that the pairwise entanglement between nearest - neighbor spins is maximum at the isotropic point  @xcite . however , the pairwise entanglement between further neighbors has a maximum near @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the ground - state pairwise entanglement is not affected by spontaneous symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the clean model , the low - energy physical behavior of all the chains parametrized by hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) in which @xmath7 is completely different , no matter how weak the disorder strength is . in the renormalization - group ( rg ) sense",
    ", it is said that the chains are governed by the so - called irfp  @xcite . within this framework ,",
    "their ground states are a collection of spin singlets whose spin pairs can be arbitrarily faraway from each other [ see fig .",
    "[ cap : ground - state](a ) ] .",
    "it is also known that the chance of finding a very distant spin singlet pair is rare  viz .",
    ", @xmath16 .",
    "however , these rare spin pairs contribute enormously to the _ average _ spin - spin correlation function , since they develop correlations of order unity .",
    "hence , the _ mean _",
    "correlation function decays algebraically as @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a _ typical _",
    "faraway spin pair is not in a singlet state , developing weak correlation @xmath18 , meaning a _ typical _ correlation function decaying as @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "how close those rare faraway singlets are to a perfect singlet ( or bell ) state is the question we address in this work .",
    "moreover , we wish to quantify their entanglement . as we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical - results ] , there are rare and extreme faraway spin pairs displaying enormous fidelity and entanglement .",
    "this is a remarkable property absent in the clean and ordered systems : two spins separated by a distance of order of the chain length and interacting indirectly through the spins between them are strongly entangled and , therefore , weakly entangled with the rest of the chain .",
    "we now explain how those rare spin pairs are located in the chain .",
    "given a disordered chain they can be easily found using the decimation rules predicted by the strong - disorder renormalization group method  @xcite .",
    "one has to search for the greatest coupling constant in the chain ",
    "say , @xmath20and then decimate spins @xmath21 and @xmath22 by coupling them in a singlet state .",
    "the neighbors spins @xmath23 and @xmath24 now interact with each other through a new renormalized coupling constant @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "the local anisotropic parameter also renormalizes to @xmath26 .",
    "iterating this procedure one can find the position of all spin pairs in the chain .",
    "since all the coupling constants ( including the renormalized ones ) are random independent variables , the singlet pairs are distributed in a random fashion , and thus the system is said to be in a random singlet phase .      having localized the spin pairs we now want to study how close they are to a pure singlet ",
    ", the bell state @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 meaning spin up and down , respectively . for this purpose",
    "we calculate the fidelity @xmath30 between the actual state describing the random singlets @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which is given as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the usual reduced density matrix of spins @xmath1 and @xmath35 ( obtained tracing out all spins but @xmath1 and @xmath35 ) and @xmath36 is the zero temperature density matrix in which @xmath37 is the ground state of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath38 if @xmath31 is a perfect singlet and that @xmath39 whenever it is orthogonal to @xmath32 .    using symmetry arguments",
    "we can show that @xmath40 , with @xmath41 and @xmath42 being the ground state spin - spin correlation .",
    "in addition , @xmath43 for the xxz af spin-1/2 chain .",
    "expanding @xmath31 in the bell basis , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , we get @xmath46 where @xmath47    however , we are also interested in a complete quantification of the entanglement between spins @xmath1 and @xmath35 . therefore , we compute its negativity  @xcite which can be defined as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the trace norm of operator @xmath50 and @xmath51 means partial transposition , in the sense that the transposition operation is performed only in spin @xmath1  @xcite . the normalization for @xmath52 was chosen such that it is equal to 1 for a maximally entangled state ( e.g. , bell state ) . a direct calculation using eq .",
    "( [ eq : decomposition ] ) gives @xmath53 we remark that whenever @xmath54 the two spins are entangled and that the greater the fidelity the greater the entanglement .",
    "the entanglement threshold @xmath55 will be an important quantity in the discussions below .",
    "note that the negativity is a function of the fidelity , implying that knowledge of the latter allows us to obtain the negativity through eq .",
    "( [ eq : negativity ] ) .",
    "moreover , a complete characterization of the entanglement properties is desirable .",
    "interestingly , for the models described by the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , we find that the logarithmic negativity @xmath56",
    "@xcite and the concurrence @xmath57",
    "@xcite can be expressed in terms of the fidelity : @xmath58 and @xmath59 where the @xmath60 s are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath61 arranged in decreasing order  @xcite , @xmath62 is the usual pauli matrix , and @xmath63 is the complex conjugate of @xmath64 . the logarithmic negativity is an additive entanglement measure for mixed states not recovering the von neumann entropy for pure states in general  @xcite .",
    "however , the entanglement of formation  @xcite , @xmath65 , with @xmath66 , is a monotonous function of the concurrence and does reduce to the von neumann entropy for pure states .",
    "we thus conclude that , due to the symmetries of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , knowledge of the fidelity is sufficient to completely quantify the entanglement between any pair of qubits in the chain .",
    "we now report our numerical study on the fidelity between spin pairs . here",
    "we employed chains with coupling constants distributed according to @xmath67 where @xmath68 and the disorder parameter @xmath69 .",
    "hence , greater @xmath70 means greater disorder and @xmath71 is the energy scale  @xcite .",
    "we have considered three different disorder parameters @xmath72 @xmath73 , and @xmath74 and chains of length @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 with periodic boundary conditions .    in order to emphasize the difference between the clean and disordered systems , we plot in fig .",
    "[ cap : histogram ] the histogram of fidelities for all spin pairs separated by odd lengths greater than a cutoff @xmath79  @xcite .       as shown in panel ( a ) , the fidelities of those spins in the disordered chain are _ typically _ less than those in the ordered one .",
    "this is because in the disordered system the typical correlation function decays @xmath18 ; hence , the _ typical _ value of @xmath30 approaches @xmath80 rapidly when @xmath81 is increased , while in the clean system the transversal and longitudinal correlation function decays as @xmath82 with @xmath83 and 2 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "moreover , as @xmath84 depends only on @xmath85 in the ordered system , the fidelities are thus sharply bounded as dictated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fidelity ] ) and clearly shown in panel ( b ) .",
    "as also shown in panel ( b ) , on the other hand , the fidelities in the disordered chain are not sharply bounded from above .",
    "it is due to the fact that @xmath84 is distributed for a fixed @xmath85 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that there exist some rare spin pairs displaying strikingly high fidelities .",
    "although they are very rare , their fidelities are above the threshold @xmath86 below which there is no entanglement [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : negativity])-([eq : concurrence ] ) ] .",
    "in contrast , there is no distant spin pair displaying such high fidelity in the clean chain .",
    "we now focus our attention on those rare and distant pairs . in order to characterize their entanglement",
    ", we choose one spin pair per chain to represent them .",
    "there are two natural choices : ( i ) the longest and ( ii ) the last decimated spin pairs .",
    "the first choice is interesting because we are focusing on pairs whose spins are extremely distant .",
    "however , we choose the second one by the following reasons : ( i ) it is easier and faster to implement numerically , ( ii ) there is a great chance the last decimated pair be the longest one , and ( iii ) as we shall see below , we focus our attention only on pairs separated by distances of order of the chain length .",
    "we thus proceed as follows .",
    "we entirely decimate a chain following the rg rules  @xcite in order to find the position of the last spin pair .",
    "then , we compute their spin - spin correlations exactly  @xcite . with this information",
    "we calculate the fidelity between this last pair and a singlet as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fidelity ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ cap : distribution - of - fidelity ] we plot the fidelity distribution @xmath87 for chains with @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 [ see panels ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , respectively ] for different chain lengths . for each length and disorder parameter , we computed a total of @xmath91 fidelities in order to build the distributions @xmath87 . in panels ( a)(c ) we retained only those pairs separated by a distance between @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( around 70% of the last spin pairs",
    "follow this requirement , independent of disorder parameter and chain length ) . in all the cases",
    "studied , there is no difference between the histograms for different chain lengths .",
    "_ _ we thus conclude that the probability of finding _ _ _ faraway and highly entangled spin pairs _ _ _ does not depend on the chain length and increases with the disorder strength . _ _     +     moreover , looking at panels ( a)(c ) and especially panel ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ cap : distribution - of - fidelity ] we clearly see that an increasing disorder increases the probability of obtaining a spin pair with greater fidelity and greater entanglement .",
    "we also highlight that for greater disorder [ panel ( c ) ] we have a reasonable probability of finding pairs of spins with @xmath94 .",
    "those pairs can be considered , for all practical purposes , perfect singlets .",
    "this is in contrast with ordered and clean chains in which pairwise entanglement is found only between nearest neighbors  @xcite .",
    "we want now to draw some attention to the following caveat .",
    "the mean value of the fidelities concerning all spin pairs separated by distances of order of the chain length approaches 1/4 as the chain length increases .",
    "however , there are always some rare spin pairs displaying enormous entanglement [ as shown in fig .",
    "[ cap : histogram](b ) ] .",
    "moreover , the probability of finding them is @xmath16 ; i.e. , it depends only on their separation  @xcite .",
    "precisely , for @xmath95 , the probabity of finding them equals @xmath96  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the fidelity distribution concerning only those rare spin pairs @xmath87 is completely different .",
    "it does _ not _ depend on the separation between them , and its mean value increases with the disorder strength [ as shown in figs .",
    "[ cap : distribution - of - fidelity](a)[cap : distribution - of - fidelity](c ) ] .",
    "our results are in agreement with the localized nature of the ground state .",
    "spin pairs separated by distances greater than the corresponding order - disorder crossover length shall share correlations mediated by virtual polarizations of the spin singlets between them  @xcite . note that the fidelity distributions of those last pairs separated by distances shorter than @xmath92 is slightly shifted to the right [ see fig .",
    "[ cap : distribution - of - fidelity](d ) ] ; i.e. , the mean value of the fidelity is greater .",
    "this result does not mean there is a length dependence on @xmath87 since there are many other short - length spin pairs earlier decimated without such high fidelity .",
    "moreover , there are pairs separated by distances less than the ordered - disordered crossover length , meaning we can not simply compare such distributions .    besides the existence of a reasonable number of almost pure singlets for strong disorder , we also have a remarkable ensemble of states suited for the implementation of distillation protocols  @xcite . a distillation protocol",
    "can be seen as a local procedure by which we can obtain @xmath97 singlets from an ensemble of @xmath98 mixed states .",
    "one can show  @xcite that only mixed states @xmath31 with a fidelity , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : f ] ) , greater than 1/2 can be employed for distillation purposes . and this is exactly the scenario we have in random af spin-1/2 chains .",
    "for example , for a disorder parameter @xmath73 we have almost @xmath99 of the last decimated singlets with @xmath54 and we can find many pairs of spins more than @xmath100 sites apart with fidelities above this threshold . for @xmath74",
    "we achieve rates greater than @xmath101 .",
    "remarkably , those spins are extremely distant from each other  namely , fractions of the chain size .",
    "typically , the effective coupling @xmath102 between distant spins is exponentially weak  viz . , @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is a constant proportional to the disorder strength but of order of unit  @xcite .",
    "analyzing the distribution of @xmath102 we find @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 for @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "thus , the typical value of @xmath102 with respect to a chain with disorder parameter @xmath74 for a pair separated by a distance , say , @xmath108 is of order @xmath109 . with this result",
    ", one may be concerned about effects of local perturbations on the singlets and also effects of finite temperature . however , although the typical value of @xmath102 decreases @xmath18 , the width of the distribution of @xmath110 increases @xmath111 , meaning there is a finite probability to find a high - fidelity spin singlet with relatively strong coupling . among our data regarding chains with lengths up to 100 sites and @xmath74",
    ", we found 5 chains where the distances between the spins were greater than 40 sites , the fidelities were greater than 0.75 , and their effective couplings were greater than @xmath112 . from the energetic point of view , less disordered chains are favorable . for the chain with @xmath88 and same length , we found 11 of those spin pairs but their effective coupling were greater than @xmath113 .",
    "we now put our results in a more general context .",
    "consider first the random af dimerized spin chains whose hamiltonian is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) with different coupling constant distributions between odd and even bonds . in the griffiths phase",
    "near criticality ( i.e. , the even and odd coupling constant distributions are not identical but have great overlap ) , the strong - disorder rg scheme also applies and spin pairs couple in singlet states  @xcite .",
    "thus , random spin pairs resembling perfect singlets are also expected .",
    "however , the probability of finding distant spins in a singlet state is lower when compared to the model studied here .",
    "also , it is known that the random af two - leg and zigzag spin-1/2 ladders renormalize to random critical or dimerized spin chains in certain conditions  @xcite .",
    "this suggest that the results here presented also apply to those systems .",
    "let us now raise an interesting question : if the singletlike spin pairs are weakly perturbed , how do they behave after a projective measurement ?",
    "it is reasonable to expect they will oscillate coherently with a period inversely proportional to their effective coupling constant .",
    "this means that spins @xmath85 sites away will slowly oscillate with period @xmath114 while the rest of the chain stays unperturbed  @xcite .",
    "note that in this strong - disorder scenario there is no room for the characteristic `` decoherence wave '' of the clean system  @xcite . the mechanism behind such `` protection '' against decoherence is certainly related with the localized aspect of the system , where the effective coupling between the spin pair and the rest of the chain is weak [ see fig .  [ cap : ground - state](b ) ] .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the ground state of random af spin-1/2 chains displays remarkable entanglement properties .",
    "first , it is possible to find long - distance spin pairs that are almost perfect singlets .",
    "actually , the more disorder the system possesses , the greater is the probability of finding such pairs , meaning that they become weakly perturbed singletlike states .",
    "these results are in agreement with what is expected from the localized nature of the ground state as given by the strong - disorder rg scenario of the random singlet phase .",
    "however , the fidelities and negativities here calculated provided the first suitable and exact quantification of how much such pairs resembles a singlet state .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the distribution of the fidelity and entanglement between distant singlet - like pairs does not depend on the chain length , depending only on the disorder .",
    "consequently , the probability to find a high - fidelity spin pair is equal to @xmath115 , provided the distance @xmath85 between them be much longer than the corresponding order - disorder crossover length .",
    "notice the only dependence on disorder is given in @xmath87 as shown in figs .",
    "[ cap : distribution - of - fidelity](a)[cap : distribution - of - fidelity](c ) .",
    "in addition to showing that some spin pairs are very good quantum channels ( fidelity with a singlet @xmath116 ) we have shown that all the weakly perturbed spin pairs can be used to create perfect singlets . for strong disorder",
    "we have shown that more than @xmath99 of these pairs possess fidelities greater than the lower bound 1/2 above which quantum distillation protocols , procedures in which a few perfect singlets can be obtained from a large ensemble of mixed states , become feasible .",
    "we also point out that the use of local defects in related models in order to achieve strongly entangled states was reported in ref .",
    "however , the entanglement there were obtained between near spins ( qubits ) in contrast to those here reported .",
    "finally , it has been recently achieved an experimental realization of the af spin-5/2 heisenberg model  @xcite .",
    "the astonishing experimental precision achieved by the scanning tunneling microscope leads to an unprecedent experimental possibility of confronting the theoretical predictions of the effects of disorder on low - dimensional magnets .",
    "in particular , this experiment suggests that in the near future the results here presented can be tested and applied to the creation of highly entangled quantum channels .",
