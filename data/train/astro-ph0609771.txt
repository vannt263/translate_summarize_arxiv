    "in astrophysical and cosmological contexts , the dynamic evolution of a spherical gas flow has been studied both numerically and analytically since late 1960s @xcite . sufficiently far away from initial and boundary conditions",
    ", such flows may gradually evolve into a self - similar phase ( sedov 1959 ) .",
    "shu ( 1977 ) constructed the ` expansion wave collapse solution ' ( ewcs ) in a self - gravitating isothermal gas cloud and advocated the so - called inside out collapse scenario for forming low - mass stars @xcite .",
    "such a similarity isothermal cloud collapse process involves a diverging mass density @xmath8 and a diverging radial infall speed @xmath9 near the collapsing core yet with a @xmath10 far away in a static envelope characterized by the outer part of a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) .",
    "the boundary of the infall region expands at a constant sound speed . for a more general polytropic gas , similarity solutions",
    "have also been derived and analyzed from various perspectives @xcite . with effects of unknown energetic processes relegated to the polytropic index @xmath4 , these polytropic solutions , among others ,",
    "become more flexible and versatile in modelling core collapsing processes in a molecular cloud .",
    "shocks can be constructed in an isothermal flow @xcite .",
    "these similarity shock solutions contain important realistic features to model large - scale flow dynamics around star - forming regions . while there are two- or three - dimensional numerical simulations to model sub - structures in star - forming regions @xcite",
    ", we explore in this paper the full extent of possible one - dimensional features under spherical symmetry that are extendable to two- or three - dimensional flow modelling in principle .",
    "recently , lou & shen ( 2004 ) obtained a novel class of semi - complete isothermal flows , including those referred to as ` envelope expansions with core collapses ' ( eecc ) that may or may not involve the sonic critical line .",
    "such solutions can model simultaneous inner collapse and outer flow expansion with or without shocks and are applied to star - formation regions such as b335 cloud system @xcite .",
    "in particular , shen & lou ( 2004 ) emphasized that a cloud envelope , with a central collapsing core to form a star or a star cluster , may either expand or contract depending on initial environmental conditions .",
    "fatuzzo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) considered a polytropic gas collapse under self - gravity in reference to observationally inferred far - away inflows .",
    "they adopted different polytropic indices for equations of state for an initial static cloud and a cloud in dynamic evolution in a more general manner .",
    "central mass accretion rates are also examined as compared with observations ( fatuzzo et al .",
    "2004 ) . in this paper",
    ", we study polytropic gas flow solutions across the sonic critical curve either with or without shocks , which was not considered by fatuzzo et al .",
    "moreover , semi - complete eecc solutions crossing the sonic critical curve twice in a polytropic gas are also constructed as an extension of the isothermal result of lou & shen ( 2004 ) .",
    "both shock and eecc features are expected in clouds with collapsing cores surrounding proto - star forming regions .",
    "this theoretical development , together with shock modelling ( bian & lou 2005 ; yu & lou 2005 ; yu et al .",
    "2006 ) and adaptations , may also bear physical implications for the dynamic evolution phase with a timescale of @xmath11yrs linking agbs and pne ( e.g. , balick & frank 2002 and extensive references therein ) observations of star - forming regions have been accumulating over years .",
    "various optical , infrared , sub - millimeter and more recent x - ray observations reveal structures on different scales of hundreds of star - forming regions , a few of which are well observed @xcite and become valuable sources for checking and testing theoretical model development . by simulating characteristic spectral line profiles",
    "given an underlying model of dynamic or magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) flows , one can infer information of a star - forming region by estimating the density and flow profiles , velocity dispersion , temperature scaling and central mass accretion rate and so forth . with these considerations in mind ,",
    "we present in  2 our polytropic similarity flow model , including the polytropic eecc and shock solutions .",
    "several aspects of probing star - forming processes are discussed in  3 .",
    "further discussion of our model application is presented in  4 .",

    "this may be heuristically viewed as a combination of bondi ( 1952 ) accretion and parker ( 1958 ) solar wind such that the sonic critical curve are smoothly crossed twice ( lou & shen 2004 ) .",
    "we see also that a l - p type solution and an inner collapse solution with @xmath104 do not cross the sonic critical curve because of the absence of eigensolutions near the sonic critical curve ( see equation [ equ : criticalasym ] and the relevant discussion ) .",
    "nevertheless , this problem can be solved by introducing a shock as shown in the next subsection .",

    "these shock conditions are derived from the mass conservation , the momentum conservation and the formal entropy conservation along the streamline .    for gas flows with a constant polytropic index @xmath4 for the equation of state , the sound speed @xmath46 jumps across the shock front because of the temperature discontinuity there .",

    "our definition of the self - similar independent variable @xmath36 is of the scaling @xmath114 ( see equation [ equ : varx ] and the relevant discussion ) . due to this jump in the sound speed @xmath46 , independent variable @xmath36 shifts in the self - similar framework accordingly across the shock front , namely @xmath115 therefore the same physical interface located at @xmath19 at a given time @xmath20 shows a separation across the shock front in our self - similar presentation because of this shock discontinuity shown in figure [ fig4 ] . from equations ( [ equ : varu ] ) and ( [ shock_v ] ) , we obtain the shock jump conditions in the shock reference framework in the reduced self - similar form @xmath116 @xmath117 \\label{shock2}\\ ] ] ( see appendix c for details of derivation ) .",
    "because of the entropy change across the shock front , the constant @xmath5 is different on two sides of the shock front and the relation @xmath118 holds .",
    "we determine the post - shock quantities from the pre - shock physical conditions by applying equations ( [ shock1 ] ) and ( [ shock2 ] ) . during this process of shock construction ,",
    "equations ( [ shock_t ] ) and ( [ equ : shock_discontinuity ] ) are used to determine the post - shock ( downstream ) independent variable @xmath119 .",
    "thus these shock conditions serve as the condition to cross the sonic critical curve . using the matching procedure of shen & lou ( 2004 ) ,",
    "we obtain different classes of shock solutions .",
    "that is , when integrated from an outer boundary condition to a certain place near the sonic critical curve , the jump conditions ( [ shock1 ] ) and ( [ shock2 ] ) are used to get the post - shock ( downstream ) quantities .",
    "simultaneously , another asymptotic solution from an inner boundary condition is integrated outwards . when these two solutions match with each other in all quantities satisfying the shock conditions , a shock solution is then found .",
    "displayed in figure [ fig4 ] are different types of shock solutions with polytropic parameters @xmath120 and @xmath121 . in this presentation of @xmath90 versus @xmath36 ,",
    "the first quadrant with @xmath58 and @xmath91 physically represents collapse or inflow solutions . while the fourth quadrant with @xmath58 and @xmath92 physically represents expansion , wind or outflow solutions .",
    "the solid curve spanning these two quadrants is the sonic critical curve .",
    "dash - dotted straight lines connect the pre - shock and post - shock sides across the shock .",
    "these straight connection lines are not vertical because the same shock front has different scalings for the independent variable @xmath36 on two sides in the self - similar framework ( see equation [ equ : shock_discontinuity ] ) .",
    "three types of shock solutions are presented together , namely , shocks running into a static atmosphere , accretion shocks and wind shocks are shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "we see that for the curve with the core mass parameter @xmath122 , different kinds of shocks ( shocks running into a static atmosphere and wind shocks etc . )",
    "can be constructed when the shock location or speed changes .",
    "therefore the shock location is an additional parameter to join different inner ( final ) and outer ( initial ) conditions .",
    "for the same reason , shocks running into a static atmosphere ( e.g. , curves with @xmath123 and @xmath124 ) are constructed in both clouds with and without a central core .    from the two @xmath125 and @xmath126 curves in figure",
    "[ fig4 ] , we note that an accretion shock can be constructed for a cloud either with or without a central core mass",
    ". a close look at the @xmath126 curve shows that this is actually a ` breeze ' shock solution which tends to be an outflow at a large @xmath36 and the flow speed eventually approaches zero as @xmath61 ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] because of scale restrictions ) .",
    "the pure coreless wind shock with @xmath127 is a new addition to the shock solution family .",
    "these shock solutions show various features for the inner and outer parts as in fig .",
    "the introduction of shocks enriches the variety of the semi - complete solution family ( because shock location or speed itself is an additional parameter ) and is qualitatively consistent with observations of star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "there are several important observational aspects for an isolated star - forming region : the mass density profile , the temperature profile , the radial flow speed profile , the core mass accretion rate , magnetic field , and the angular momentum . in a spherically symmetric model , we consider and discuss the first five aspects except the last , and",
    "provide estimates of the star - forming cloud system b335 . before coming to specific astrophysical applications",
    ", we clarify the physical meaning of similarity solutions passing through the sonic critical curve . for recent observations of star - forming regions , the features of inner part and outer edge",
    "are well observed and may serve as initial states for different kinds of star - formation models .",
    "similarity solutions passing through the sonic critical curve with or without shocks can join all kinds of different inner and outer physical states ( see figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig4 ] ) , while similarity solutions without crossing the sonic critical curve have much less freedom ( suto & silk 1988 ; fatuzzo et al .",
    "for example , the eecc solutions ( lou & shen 2004 ) , most of which pass through the sonic critical curve , represent a new class of similarity solutions that are not constructed previously without encountering the sonic critical curve .",
    "polytropic shock solutions also form a new family ; these shocks connect various inner and outer physical states and provide theoretical basis for modeling shock phenomena observed recently @xcite .      by asymptotic solution ( [ equ : zero1 ] ) at small @xmath36 , the inner collapsing core in a free - fall state of a pre - stellar region has a mass density profile of @xmath128 .",
    "this leading radial power - law scaling is also predicted by the isothermal model @xcite and appears consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "in other words , this information of inner mass density scaling alone can not distinguish between polytropic and isothermal cloud models .",
    "for the outer part of a pre - stellar region ( sufficiently far away from the collapsing core ) , the isothermal cloud model gives a mass density profile @xmath129 , while the polytropic cloud model predicts @xmath130 ( see equation [ equ : infinity ] ) .",
    "then for @xmath52 corresponding to a constant @xmath25 in a conventional polytropic gas , the mass density profile for the outer part is @xmath131 so @xmath132 means a density exponent smaller than @xmath133 corresponding to a steeper density profile , while @xmath134 means a density exponent between @xmath135 and @xmath133 corresponding to a less steep density profile .",
    "earlier observations gave a mass density profile with an exponent around @xmath133 with considerable errors @xcite .",
    "recent observations show that this mass density exponent for the very outer parts ( at radii @xmath136au ) of starless cores is about @xmath137 to @xmath138 @xcite , corresponding to a polytropic index @xmath139 .",
    "this observational evidence appears sensible and encouraging for a polytropic model .",
    "corresponding to the inner mass density profile @xmath8 , the radial scaling of thermal temperature @xmath110 for an ideal gas in the inner free - fall region would be @xmath140 this inner temperature @xmath110 would be constant for an isothermal cloud model with @xmath24 .",
    "the observed negative index of temperature scaling @xcite calls for @xmath132 in the inner region , qualitatively similar to the @xmath4 value inferred for the outer mass density profile .",
    "these radial scalings of cloud temperature are important features to constrain a polytropic cloud model by equations ( [ equ : density ] ) and ( [ equ : temp ] ) . for the reference of observational diagnostics , the gas temperature sufficiently far away ( i.e. , large @xmath19 ) from the collapsing core is given either by a constant @xmath110 for an isothermal cloud model or by @xmath141 for a conventional polytropic cloud model .",
    "of course , the complete temperature profile in a conventional polytropic gas can be readily computed for observational comparison .",
    "the key message here is that independent determination of cloud temperature is extremely valuable for distinguishing models for cloud dynamics .",
    "outflow features in star - forming regions are well documented in recent years . in spite of the large - scale bipolar morphology of these outflows , we are mainly interested in core regions of these outflow sources with free - fall collapse or infall characteristics @xcite that are grossly in accord with our shock scenario of eecc .    collapses and outflows",
    "were thought to happen in different stages during a star formation process , and they were considered separately @xcite . however , at least @xmath142 of identified outflows show characteristics of collapses or infalls @xcite .",
    "note that infall characteristics are more difficult to identify than those of an outflow due to the complexity of observed spectral lines and in the analysis of line profiles .",
    "one would expect that more infall motions can be identified in outflow sources in the future .",
    "our polytropic eecc shock solutions provide underlying dynamic models for simulating spectral line profiles , during a certain epoch of a star formation cloud .",
    "the most expected line profile features are those from eecc solutions , that is , inflow and outflow within and outside a certain radius @xmath19 .",
    "double peak spectral line features representing outflow will be observed away from the core , and combined double peak line features from both outflow and inflow will be seen around collapsing cores . using an isothermal model for self - similar cloud dynamics (",
    "lou & shen 2004 ) , shen & lou ( 2004 ) emphasized the notion that a molecular cloud with a free - fall collapsing core at the centre can have various possible forms of motion sufficiently far away from the collapsing core , depending on the evolutionary history of the cloud .",
    "such far away radial flows of a cloud may be characterized by a wind , a breeze , an outer part of a static singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) , a contraction , or a inflow .",
    "furthermore , all these possible radial flow profiles can involve shocks across the sonic critical curve ( tsai & hsu 1995 ; shu et al .",
    "2002 ; shen & lou 2004 ; bian & lou 2005 ) . and",
    "this can give rise to a wide range for the central mass accretion rate to be discussed presently in the next subsection .",
    "all these important features in an isothermal cloud model can be further incorporated into a polytropic cloud model .    in reference to extensive cloud observations ,",
    "fatuzzo et al . (",
    "2004 ) noted a ubiquitous feature of far away inflows and/or contractions in clouds with central free - fall collapsing cores .",
    "this differs from the static sis envelope as initially introduced by shu ( 1977 ) for the ewcs for star formation . the polytropic cloud model of fatuzzo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) also allows the polytropic indices to be different for an initially static cloud and for the subsequent evolution of a dynamic cloud .",

    "2004 ) did not consider self - similar polytropic flow solutions that cross the sonic critical curve smoothly and that involve shocks .",
    "our model analysis here opens up these two important possibilities in a unified theoretical framework .",
    "moreover , we emphasize again that in a polytropic cloud model , a cloud with a central free - fall core collapse can be simultaneously characterized by a far - away polytropic wind ( @xmath143 in equation [ equ : infinity ] ) or a far - away polytropic breeze ( @xmath144 and @xmath145 in equation [ equ : infinity ] ) with or without shocks .",
    "gas flows with central core collapse and far - away outflow or breeze are common in star - forming regions @xcite , indicating the capacity of our solutions passing through the sonic critical curve .",
    "it is highly desirable to synthesize spectral line profiles using radial flow speed and mass density profiles from these underlying self - similar dynamic models for developing radiative diagnostics and for extensive observational comparisons .      the core mass accretion rate from equations ( [ equ : varx ] ) , ( [ equ : varu ] ) and ( [ equ : zero1 ] ) is given by @xmath146 .",
    "for @xmath52 corresponding to a constant @xmath25 of a conventional polytropic gas , the core mass accretion rate appears as @xmath147 ( see also equation 31 of fatuzzo et al .",
    "2004 ; the difference in a numerical factor is related to a different definition of notations ) , which is constant in the isothermal case of @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "a constant @xmath148 is inconsistent with observations within a formation timescale of @xmath149yr @xcite .",
    "the polytropic analysis does offer a possible leeway to model a variable @xmath148 in time @xmath20 .",
    "for a fixed @xmath6 , there are two parameters @xmath5 and @xmath4 to adjust . here",
    "@xmath5 is related to the sound speed @xmath46 ( see equation [ equ : varx ] ) and @xmath4 can be inferred observationally from the radial mass density profile as discussed in  3.1 .",
    "for various shock solutions , the @xmath6 parameter can vary in a wide range . although not easily done , it is crucial to identify the evolution phase of a dynamical cloud system and estimate or guess @xmath20 accordingly as discussed presently .",
    "for @xmath134 and @xmath132 in equation ( [ accretion rate1 ] ) , the core mass accretion rate @xmath148 increases and decreases with time @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "observations of star - forming systems @xcite indicate that mass accretion rates generally decrease in time @xmath20 .",
    "this appears consistent qualitatively with @xmath132 for most cloud systems with free - fall collapsing cores .",
    "this inference of @xmath132 also agrees with the interpretation of steeper outer density profiles and the inner temperature power - law scaling with a negative index ( see  3.1 ) . for shock flows ,",
    "the core mass accretion rate varies with shock locations and thus shock speeds @xcite .",
    "this is because the value of @xmath6 is different for different shock locations .",
    "the reason why @xmath132 or @xmath134 induce different @xmath148 is as follows . for @xmath52 in equation ( [ equ : varx ] ) , a physical interface for a fixed @xmath36",
    "travels with increasing speed for @xmath134 .",
    "when this interface is set between the inflow and outflow regions at @xmath57 , we have an increase of infall mass @xmath150 . for a fixed @xmath36 ,",
    "the product @xmath151 also increases with time @xmath20 for @xmath134 , then the increasing interface speed @xmath152 leads to increasing mass infall rate . for @xmath132 ,",
    "the interface travels at a decreasing speed and the product @xmath153 also decreases , thus the mass infall rate decreases .",
    "when we set the interface at the shock location , the conclusion is that @xmath134 and @xmath132 lead to acceleration and deceleration of shocks , respectively .",
    "the cloud system b335 is a well - studied protostellar collapse candidate that has been observed through molecular lines @xcite .",
    "data fitting and analysis of @xmath154 and @xmath155 molecular transition lines agrees well with the inside - out collapse model ( shu 1977 ; shu et al .",
    "1987 ) , yet the angular resolution of observations is still not good enough @xcite .",
    "recent observations of institut de radio astronomie millimtrique , plateau de bure interferometer ( iram pdbi ) give several new results on this protostellar core @xcite .",
    "first , a compact component with a circumstellar disc was identified . secondly , the inner mass density profile is @xmath156 with @xmath157 in a certain region @xmath158 .",
    "thirdly , another valuable information is the gas temperature profile of @xmath159 in a certain region @xmath160 . here",
    ", we tentatively take @xmath161au .",
    "the inner mass density profile @xmath156 with @xmath162 agrees with a free - fall core collapse ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "both polytropic and isothermal models show this scaling result .",
    "the outer density profile ( @xmath164au ) also shows a power law with an index @xmath165 .",
    "this result may be regarded as consistent with the isothermal model with @xmath166 , while the polytropic model can fit this result more accurately if we set @xmath167 in the outer part .",
    "one difficulty for the isothermal model is that the shallow slope ( @xmath168 ) of density profile at the edge of collapse region is still not observed @xcite .",
    "but no shallow slope is necessary in the polytropic cloud model .",
    "the temperature profile is @xmath159 for @xmath169au , that is @xmath170 at @xmath171 and increase to @xmath172 at @xmath173au @xcite . as observations show that @xmath174 near the core , we need to set @xmath175 in the inner region to fit @xmath176 ( see equation [ equ : temp ] ) . while one might use the isothermal model and assume different temperatures in different cloud regions , the polytropic cloud model with a temperature variation appears more sensible .    from the outer mass density profile and the inner temperature scaling of b335 system ,",
    "we infer @xmath167 for @xmath177au @xmath178au and @xmath175 for @xmath179au .",
    "this difference of @xmath4 shows that @xmath4 is not a constant at least for certain cloud systems with core collapses . only when the outer mass density profile is steeper than @xmath129 ,",
    "can @xmath4 become a constant .",
    "outflow and shock phenomena in b335 are also reported in recent years @xcite . while previous isothermal solutions @xcite or polytropic solutions without crossing the sonic critical curve ( fatuzzo et al .",
    "2004 ) can not fit these observed conditions , these physical conditions can be related and constructed using an eecc shock curve passing through the sonic critical curve .",
    "thus , this cloud system may be modelled as eecc self - similar shock solutions in a polytropic gas .",
    "when a cloud is partially ionized , the magnetic field permeated in the cloud can exert an influence on the mhd evolution of the cloud system . physically , magnetic field directly interacts with the charged particles which in turn interact with neutral particles through sufficiently frequent collisions .",
    "if the mhd timescale of interest is much longer than collision timescales between electrically charged and neutral particles , we may ignore the effect of ambipolar diffusion and adopt a mhd approximation to describe large - scale flows of a magnetized cloud .",
    "moreover , the presence of magnetic field also leads to useful radiative diagnostics .",
    "for example , the presence of relativistic electrons produced by shocks or proto - stellar activities and of magnetic field together can give rise to cyclotron and synchrotron emissions .    depending on the evolutionary history , magnetic field in a collapsing cloud under self - gravity may possess a variety of gross geometries ( e.g. , chandrasekhar & fermi 1953 ; chandrasekhar 1954 ; strittmatter 1966 ; bisnovatyi - kogan , ruzmaikin , & sunyaev 1973 ; mestel 1986 ; rees 1987 ; lou 1996 ) .",
    "we outline below a possible scenario involving magnetic field to pave the way for further investigations .",
    "it is perceived that a partially ionized gas cloud under self - gravity is permeated with a completely random magnetic field ( e.g. , zeldovich & novikov 1971 ) .",
    "for such a random magnetic field , we envision a random ` thread ball ' scenario in a vast spatial volume of gas medium .",
    "a magnetic field line follows the ` thread ' meandering within a thin spherical ` layer ' in space in a random manner .",
    "strictly speaking , there is always a random weak radial magnetic field component such that random magnetic field lines in adjacent ` layers ' are actually connected throughout in space . by taking a large - scale ensemble average of such a magnetized gas cloud ,",
    "we are then left with packed ` layers ' of random magnetic field components dominantly transverse to the radial direction . over large scales ,",
    "the mhd collapse and flow in such a magnetized cloud are approximated as quasi - spherically symmetric ( yu & lou 2006 ; yu , lou , bian & wu 2006 ; wang & lou 2006 ) .",
    "in addition to the thermal gas pressure force and self - gravity in the cloud , the magnetic lorentz force consisting of magnetic pressure and tension forces will come into play for a sufficiently strong magnetic field .",
    "mhd generalizations of isothermal hydrodynamic self - similar solutions are readily available ( yu et al .",
    "for example , for the mhd free - fall asymptotic solution towards the core , the magnetic field strength diverges yet the self - gravity remains overwhelming over the thermal pressure force and the lorentz force combined .",
    "in such an mhd core collapse process , a strongly magnetized environment can be created and sustained surrounding a proto - stellar core .",
    "accretion and rebound mhd shocks can emerge ( bian & lou 2005 ; yu et al .",
    "2006 ; wang & lou 2006 ) . near the very centre ,",
    "various magnetic activities , persistent or sporadic , are naturally expected to break the quasi - spherical symmetry as well as the self - similarity .",
    "if a cloud possesses an initial angular momentum , then such a core collapse under self - gravity will lead to a rapid gas rotation and a disc formation surrounding the proto - stellar core ; in such a strongly magnetized environment , the coupling between the magnetic field and disc rotation can give rise to collimated outflows such as jets or winds ( e.g. , lovelace 1976 ; blandford & payne 1982 ; shu et al .",
    "1997 ; ferrari 1998 ) .",
    "this type of mhd collapse processes may lead to intensely magnetized proto - stellar objects .",
    "for star - forming cloud systems , the outer mass density profile , the inner and outer temperature profiles , and the core mass accretion rate are crucial to test or constrain a polytropic cloud model . given a self - similar dynamic profile in a polytropic gas , spectral line profiles can be simulated .",
    "these spectral line profiles are very important to show different evolution epochs in forming proto - stars .",
    "in addition to forming proto - stars , the variable core mass accretion rate @xmath180 by equation ( [ accretion rate1 ] ) also bears physical implications for the dynamic evolution phase with a timescale of @xmath11yrs linking agbs and pne @xcite .",
    "further observations and analysis are needed especially for post - pne of different ages .",
    "we also expect adaptations of our polytropic shock model to a certain epoch of supernova explosions ( lou & wang 2006 ) , with radiation and neutrino pressures also taken into account .",
    "shock phenomena are common in forming proto - stars , formation and evolution of pne , and supernova explosions ; they are important for the gas heating , the production of high - energy photons , the synthesis of heavy elements , and the acceleration of cosmic ray particles . in these contexts as well as others , our polytropic shock model has wide applicability",
    ". properties of polytropic shocks should be explored further to include radiation processes , magnetic field effects ( yu et al .",
    "2006 ; wang & lou 2006 ) and atomic / nuclear processes associated with shocks .",
    "radiative transfer processes will be incorporated into our model to make the underlying dynamic processes ` visible ' .",
    "spectral line profiles of certain atoms and molecules can reveal profiles of mass density , flow velocity and gas temperature .",
    "the eecc profiles and shocks are the most important features .",
    "certain spectral line features derived from various underlying dynamic solutions should be compared with observations .",
    "recent and further high - resolution spectral ir and microwave telescopes will surely stimulate the development of dynamic study of star - formation , formation / evolution of pne , sne and other relevant astrophysical processes .",
