    "since the extremely narrow positive strangeness pentaquark state @xmath0(@xmath1 ) of mass 1.54 gev and @xmath2 is predicted@xcite and with several experimental searches being successfully undertaken@xcite , pentaquark becomes the hot topic of investigation .",
    "the discovery of the exotic baryon @xmath0 with positive strangeness opens new possibilities of forming exotic @xmath0 hypernuclei which , like in the case of negative strangeness @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 hypernuclei which have obtained steady progress at the experimental and theoretical levels@xcite , can provide information unreachable or complementary to that obtained in elementary reactions .",
    "suggestions that @xmath0 could be bound in nuclei have already been made @xciteand the selfenergy of the @xmath0 pentaquark in nuclei is calculated by d. cabrera @xmath6@xcite , they show that the in - medium renormalization of the pion in the two meson cloud of the @xmath0 leads to a sizable attraction , enough to produce a large number of bound and narrow @xmath0 states in nuclei .",
    "however , the spin , isospin and parity of @xmath0 are still not very determinate , there are many discussions about these aspects@xcite . in this work , we assume that @xmath2 and @xmath7 for @xmath0 as some suggestions in refs.@xcite , thus we can study @xmath0 hypernuclei in the framework of relativistic mean field ( rmf),which has been used to investigate @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 hypernuclei@xcite .    in the present work , our main aim is to determine the coupling constants @xmath8 , @xmath9 for the rmf calculation .",
    "then we attempt to investigate the @xmath0 hypernuclei in the framework of relativistic mean field , from which we want to know whether the @xmath0 baryon could be bound in nuclei and the how much the depth of the @xmath0-nucleus potential .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the framework of hypernuclei in rmf is introduced in sec.2 .",
    "the coupling constants are educed and determined in sec.3 .",
    "the calculations and analysis is given in sec.4 .",
    "the last sec .",
    "is the summary .",
    "in the rmf theory , the effective lagrangian density which includes the nucleon and @xmath0-hyperon can be written as @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 with @xmath13    where the meson fields are denoted by @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xmath16 , and their masses by @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , respectively ; @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the nucleon and @xmath22 baryon fields with corresponding masses @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively ; @xmath25 is the electromagnetic field .",
    "@xmath26(@xmath27 ) , @xmath28(@xmath29 ) and @xmath30(@xmath31 ) are the @xmath32(@xmath33 ) , @xmath34(@xmath35 ) and @xmath36(@xmath37 ) coupling constants , respectively . the isospin pauli matrices",
    "are written as @xmath38 , @xmath39 being the third component of @xmath38 . for @xmath22 baryon , we assume isospin @xmath7 , @xmath40 , there is no coupling to @xmath41 meson .",
    "according the quark meson coupling model developed in ref.@xcite , the baryon coupling constants can be determined .",
    "the equation of motion for meson field operators are @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the quark - meson coupling constants for @xmath14 , @xmath46 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the mean fields are defined as the expectation values in the ground state of the nucleus , @xmath47 : @xmath48 where ( t , r ) are the coordinates in the rest frame of the nucleus . in the mean field approximation",
    "the sources are the sum of the sources created by each nucleon - the latter interacting with the meson fields .",
    "thus we write @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the matrix element in the nucleon @xmath51 located at @xmath52 at time @xmath53 . according to the born - oppenheimer approximation ,",
    "the baryon structure is described by @xmath54 quarks in the lowest mode .",
    "therefore , in the instantaneous rest frame ( irf ) of the nucleon @xmath51 , we have @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the the coordinates and @xmath57 is the quark field in the irf .",
    "@xmath58 is the complete and orthogonal set of eigenfunctions which are defined by eq.(23 ) in ref.@xcite .    from the lorents transformation properties of the fields we get @xmath59 with @xmath60 the corresponding physical quantities such as @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 etc .",
    "are defined in ref.@xcite .",
    "finally , the mean field expressions for the meson sources take the form @xmath64 to simplify further , we remark that a matrix element of the form @xmath65 is negligible unless @xmath66 is less than , or of the order of , the reciprocal of the nuclear radius .",
    "we now define the scalar , baryon and isospin densities of the nucleons in the nucleus by @xmath67 where we have used @xmath68 ( eq.(58 ) of ref.@xcite ) to eliminate the factor @xmath69 .",
    "the meson sources take the simple form @xmath70 we have used the notation    @xmath71    here , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the parameters for lowest eigenvalues for the quarks and the corresponding current quark masses .",
    "@xmath74 is the radius of the bag .    since their sources are time independent and since they do not propagate , the mean fields are also time independent .",
    "so , we get the desired equations for @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 :    @xmath78    where the nucleon coupling constants and @xmath79 are defined by @xmath80    in an approximation where the @xmath75 @xmath76 and @xmath77 fields couple only to the @xmath81 and @xmath82 quarks@xcite , the coupling constants in the strange baryons are obtained as @xmath83 and @xmath84 , with @xmath85 being the total number of valence @xmath81 and @xmath82 quarks in the baryon s. for the strange baryon s , the coupling constant @xmath86 can be written as @xmath87 where @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the bag radius for the strange baryon . by combining the eq.(24 ) and eq.(25 )",
    "we get @xmath90 according eq.(24 ) @xmath91 where @xmath26 , @xmath28 , @xmath30 are the coupling constants for nucleon .",
    "so , we can easily get the relations @xmath92",
    "in this section we will show the our numerical results using relativistic mean field theory model . in the mean - field and the no - sea approximations@xcite",
    "the contributions of anti-(quasi ) particles and quantum fluctuations of mesons fields can be thus neglected .",
    "the contribution of the tensor coupling is neglected for simple , although it is considered in some refs.@xcite .",
    "the coupling constants of nucleon to mesons employed are nl - sh@xcite , which are list in table 1 .",
    "the coupling constants of @xmath0 to mesons are obtained from the relations eq.(39 ) . for @xmath0 , @xmath85=4 ,",
    "isospin @xmath7 means no coupling with @xmath41 meson .",
    "thus , we have the relations @xmath93 in practice the value for @xmath94 for all hyperons even though @xmath95@xcite , thus in our calculation , we use @xmath96 .      in figure 1 , we show the single - particle energy spectrum such as 1s1/2 , 1p3/2 , 1p1/2 , 1d5/2 ... of @xmath0 in @xmath97,@xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , which is denoted by 1 , 2a , 3 , 4a , 5 respectively .",
    "2b is the energy spectrum for @xmath102 when the coupling constant change a little to @xmath103 .",
    "2c , 2d and 4b , 4c are the results for @xmath104 and @xmath105 at the depth of potential 60 mev and 120 mev respectively of ref@xcite .    in light nuclei like @xmath106 ( 1 ) , @xmath98(2a ) and @xmath99(3 ) we find several bound states .",
    "the separation of the two deepest bound states ( 1s1/2 and 1p3/2 ) is about 24 mev for @xmath106 , about 60 mev for @xmath98 and around 30 mev for @xmath107 . for medium and heavy nuclei , as in @xmath108,@xmath101 shown in the figure",
    ", we find more bound states and the energy separation between 1s1/2 and 1p3/2 is about 18 mev for @xmath100 and about 4 mev for @xmath101 .",
    "there is a trend that the separation between 1s1/2 and 1p3/2 becomes smaller and smaller and the bound state becomes more and more with the increasing of the nucleon number .",
    "it is interesting that the width of @xmath0 is very narrow with upper limit as small as 15 mev predicted by the chiral soliton model in ref .",
    "@xcite , and 9 mev@xcite.studies based on @xmath109 scattering suggest that the width should be smaller than 5 mev@xcite .",
    "cahn and trilling have extracted @xmath110 mev from an analysis of xenon bubble chamber@xcite .",
    "the narrow upper limit width of @xmath0 is often smaller than the separation of the two deepest bound states ( 1s1/2 and 1p3/2 ) for light and medium nuclei , which would make a clear case for the experimental observation of these states .",
    "the splitting of spin - orbit for @xmath0 hypernuclei can be get from our calculation with rmf .",
    "such as , from figure 1 , we can find that the splitting between 1p3/2 and 1p1/2 is about 5 mev for @xmath106 ( 1 ) and @xmath99 , 10 mev for @xmath98 , the splitting is smaller for medium nucleus @xmath100 ( about 2 mev ) and there is no obvious splitting for heavy nucleus @xmath101 . if the prediction based on @xmath109 scattering suggest that the width should be smaller than 5 mev@xcite is true ,",
    "the the splitting between 1p3/2 and 1p1/2 is also bigger than the narrow upper limit width of @xmath0 , which means that we may observe splitting of spin - orbit for light @xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "there is a very interesting phenomenon that both separation between 1s1/2 and 1p3/2 and splitting of spin - orbit between 1p3/2 and 1p1/2 are much larger than the others .    for comparison",
    ", we also yield the the single - particle energy spectrum of @xmath0 from ref@xcite by solving schrdinger equation with two potentials .",
    "it is a very simple model and can not give the splitting of spin - orbit .",
    "it estimates that the binding energy(1s ) of @xmath98 is in the region @xmath111 mev and @xmath112 mev for @xmath100 . in our calculation",
    ", the binding energy(1s ) of @xmath98 is about 116 mev and 81 mev for @xmath100 , and the energy separation between two bound states is about 18 mev for @xmath100 and 60 mev for @xmath98 .",
    "our results are very close to the the results estimated by solving schrdinger equation in ref@xcite .    in table 1",
    "we list the calculated binding energy per baryon , @xmath113 , r.m.s .",
    "charge radius , @xmath114 , and r.m.s .",
    "radii of the @xmath0 baryon and the neutron and proton distributions ( @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 ) . for comparision",
    ", we also give these quantities without @xmath0 .",
    "the differences in vulues for finite nuclei and hypernuclei listed in table 1 reflects the effects of the @xmath0 .",
    "the appearence of @xmath0 in nuclei leads to larger binding energy per baryon , @xmath113 . from table 1",
    ", it is found that the values of @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath114 for @xmath118 , @xmath104 are obvious less than those for the corresponding normal nuclei .",
    "this is the shrinkage effect which has been found in lighter @xmath3 hypernuclei@xcite . in our calculation for @xmath119 , @xmath104",
    ", we also find that there is shrinkage effect and gluelike role for @xmath0 .",
    "but this phenomenon is not found for @xmath120 and it is not obvious for @xmath121 , @xmath105 and @xmath122 .",
    "the key point for our calculation is how to determine the coupling constants of @xmath0 to mesons as accurate as possible . in the calculation",
    ", we find that the binding energy is very sensitive to the coupling constants . in refs@xcite",
    ", they determine the the coupling constants of hyperon to mesons by adjusting @xmath123 around 2/3 ( according eq.(39),@xmath124 ) to fit the experimental data because of the effect of medium in nuclei.where @xmath125 is stands the hyperon . to consider the effect of medium to the coupling constant @xmath27",
    ", we list the result of @xmath98 in figure 1 , denoted with 2b , when the coupling constant @xmath27 changes to @xmath1260.95 . from the figure",
    ", we see the binding energy of 1s1/2 have a large change from 116 to 60 mev , but there is still several bound states and the energy separation energy between 1s1/2 and 1p3/2 is around 32 mev .    we also the list results of the ground state for @xmath98 when the coupling constant @xmath27 changes from 13.925 to 11.725 ( @xmath1260.84 ) in table 2 . from it",
    ", we can see that the binding energy of 1s1/2 is sensitive to the coupling constant , if @xmath127 , there are no bound states for @xmath0 in @xmath98 . in ref.@xcite",
    ", @xmath123 is 0.621 ( @xmath128 ) and 0.619 ( @xmath129 ) for @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively .",
    "thus , from the calculation of before@xcite , we can conclude that the effect of medium is not very large , the considered medium effective coupling constant is about @xmath132 for hyperon , if we let @xmath133=12.95 , from table 1 , we can see that the binding energy of 1s1/2 for @xmath98 is between 52 and 40 mev , which is agree with the estimation @xmath134 mev in the ref@xcite .    in table 2 , the binding energy per baryon , -e / a ( in mev ) , r.m.s .",
    "charge radius @xmath114 ( in fm ) , r.m.s .",
    "radii of @xmath0 , neutron and proton , @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( in fm ) are also shown respectively .",
    "it is seen in table 2 that the radii is increasing and the binding energy per baryon is decreasing with the decreasing of the coupling constant .",
    "when @xmath135 , @xmath136 , which means that the @xmath0 is out of the nucleus @xmath98 .",
    "it can only form @xmath0 atom .",
    ".the parametrization of the nucleonic sector ( adopted from ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the masses are given in mev and the coupling @xmath137 in @xmath138 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      in nuclear matter the @xmath0 potential depth is written as@xcite @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the values of @xmath14 and @xmath46 fields at the saturation nuclear density , respectively . use the relations @xmath142 and @xmath143 at the saturation nuclear density , we can get@xcite @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the effective mass of nucleon and @xmath146 is the saturation nuclear density . from eq.(42 ) , we can see that the depth of potential @xmath147 is determined by @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath146 , if we let @xmath150 as in eq.(40 ) .",
    "usually , the effective mass @xmath148 and saturation nuclear density @xmath146 are considered as `` experimental input '' . in the rmf calculation , @xmath151 , @xmath152@xmath153@xcite . here , we let them have some uncertain and can change in a little region .",
    "according the calculation and analysis of section 3 , when @xmath127 , there are no bound states for @xmath0 in @xmath98 , thus we let it as a approximation that there is no bound states for @xmath0 in nuclear matter when @xmath127 , namely the depth of potential @xmath154 .    in figure 2 , we show the relation of the potential depth changing with the effective mass @xmath148 for @xmath155,@xmath156 and @xmath157@xmath153 in a , b and c respectively . from figure 2(a ) , it is easily seen that @xmath147=0 corresponds to effective mass @xmath158 when @xmath159@xmath153 . with the same method we can determine @xmath160 for @xmath161@xmath153 and @xmath162 for @xmath163@xmath153 from b and c. the results of effective mass @xmath148 is reasonable , because they are around 0.6 , which agrees with the fit data in rmf@xcite .",
    "since the effective mass @xmath148 and saturation nuclear density @xmath146 are determined , we can get the potential depth at saturation nuclear density easily . from figure 2 ( a )",

    ", we also get @xmath168 mev for @xmath156@xmath153 and @xmath169 mev for @xmath157@xmath153 when @xmath166 in the same way . from the calculation",
    ", it is found that the uncertain of the saturation nuclear density can bring some uncertain for the potential depth in several mev .",
    "because there is still no experimental data for @xmath0 in nuclear matter , we can only estimate the potential depth in theory , the uncertain for the potential depth in several mev is allowed .",
    "in fact , the potential depth estimated by us agrees well with that of in ref.@xcite@xmath170 mev .",
    "we have educed the coupling constants for strange many quarks system with quark meson coupling model .",
    "we get the relation @xmath171 , @xmath172 for @xmath0 coupling with @xmath14 and @xmath46 meson . with the coupling constants for @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath9 educed by us , the calculations for @xmath0 in nuclei are carried out in the framework of rmf . from the single - particle levels of @xmath0 in nuclei , it is found that there are several bound states for light nuclei , such as @xmath120 , and more bound states for heavier nuclei .",
    "the binding energies of 1s1/2 are usually as high as 50 mev to 120 mev , which means that there are strong attractive interaction for @xmath0-nucleus .",
    "this prediction of rmf is agree with the prediction of refs.@xcite .",
    "the strong attractive interaction for @xmath0-nucleus induces stronger per nucleon binding energy than normal nuclei , which can be seen obviously in table 2 . because of the strong attractive interaction for @xmath0-nucleus , the shrinking effect is found for light nuclei @xmath119 and @xmath104 , in medium or heavy nuclei",
    "there is no obvious shrinking effect .",
    "the shrinking effect is first found in the light @xmath3-hypernucleus for lithium hypernuclei@xcite , but there is no shrinking effect for @xmath120 in rmf prediction .",
    "the depth of optical potential for @xmath0 in nuclear matter is investigated , the region is given .",
    "if we assume the saturation nuclear density @xmath159 0.16 and 0.17 @xmath153 with the coupling constant @xmath166 , the depth of potential @xmath173 mev , @xmath168 mev and @xmath174 mev , respectively .    in this work we assume that @xmath2 and @xmath7 for @xmath0 , and when we induce the coupling constants in section 3 with qmc model , we do an approximation where the @xmath75 @xmath76 and @xmath77 fields couple only to the @xmath81 and @xmath82 quarks .",
