    "measurements in this field rely , to a large extent , on the non - destructive detection of the trapped particle s eigenfrequencies .",
    "for instance , the most precise measurements of atomic masses are based on penning trap experiments @xcite .",
    "these measurements have impact on neutrino physics @xcite , as well as on stringent tests of relativistic energy - mass equivalence @xcite .",

    "other penning trap based measurements provide the most stringent tests of the fundamental charge , parity , time invariance .",
    "electron / positron magnetic anomaly frequencies were compared with fractional precisions at the parts per billion ( p.p.b@xmath5 ) level @xcite , and the fundamental properties of protons and antiprotons , such as charge - to - mass ratios @xcite and @xmath4-factors @xcite were compared with 90@xmath1parts per trillion ( p.p.t@xmath5 ) and 4.4@xmath1parts per million ( p.p.m@xmath5 ) precision , respectively . in our experiments",
    "we operate multi penning - trap systems dedicated to comparing the fundamental properties of protons and antiprotons with unprecedented precision @xcite . recently , we reported on the most precise comparison of the proton - to - antiproton charge - to - mass ratio with a fractional precision of 69@xmath1p.p.t@xmath5 @xcite , and the most precise measurement of the magnetic moment of a single trapped proton with a fractional precision of 3.3@xmath1p.p.b@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "+ our measurements rely on non - destructive measurements of the characteristic oscillation frequencies @xcite of the trapped particles : the modified cyclotron frequency @xmath6 , the magnetron frequency @xmath7 , and the axial frequency @xmath8 .",
    "an invariance theorem @xcite @xmath9 relates these eigenfrequencies to the free cyclotron frequency @xmath10 , and consequently to the fundamental properties of the particle ; charge @xmath11 and mass @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is the magnetic field at the center of the trap .",
    "+ the oscillatory motions of the particles induce tiny image currents @xmath14 on the trap electrodes .",
    "these currents are detected by means of highly - sensitive superconducting tuned circuits which act at their resonance frequencies as effective resistors @xmath15 .",
    "the detectors are connected directly to the trap electrodes .",
    "the resulting voltage signals are then amplified and the time - transients are analyzed by using fast fourier transform ( fft ) spectrum analyzers .",
    "+   + here , we report on the development of highly - sensitive image - current detection systems based on superconducting toroidal coils and ultra - low noise cryogenic amplifiers .",
    "this allows for the non - destructive measurement of the axial frequency @xmath8 of the antiproton .",
    "a superconducting switch allows us to sensitively tune particle - detector interaction .",
    "this novel feature is crucial for fidelity tuning in single spin - transition spectroscopy experiments @xcite and will be used in our planned high - precision antiproton magnetic moment measurements .",
    "of a single trapped particle .",
    "the detector consists of a superconducting tuned circuit with resonance frequency matched to @xmath8 and a cryogenic ultra - low noise amplifier .",
    "the particle s eigenfrequency is obtained from the fourier spectrum of the image current using an fft analyzer . for details , see text.,width=321 ]     to the equivalent input noise of the amplifier @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 is the 3@xmath1db width of the dip.,width=321 ]    fig.@xmath11 shows a schematic for the detection of the axial frequency @xmath8 of a particle in a penning trap .",
    "the detector consists of a superconducting tuned circuit with high quality factor ( @xmath18-value ) and a cryogenic ultra - low noise amplifier . the trap and resonator form a parallel @xmath19 tuned circuit , @xmath20 being the inductance of the superconducting coil and @xmath21 the sum of the parasitic capacitances of the trap and the coil itself . at resonance",
    "the reactances compensate each other and appear as an effective parallel resistance , @xmath22 .",
    "+ the axial frequency of the trapped particle @xmath8 is tuned to the resonance frequency @xmath23 of the tuned circuit by adjusting the voltages applied to the penning trap electrodes .",
    "a voltage drop @xmath24 is detected , where @xmath25 is the image current induced on the trap electrode , @xmath26 is the axial coordinate and @xmath27 is a trap - specific length , for the geometry of our traps , @xmath28 mm .",
    "the signal @xmath29 is subsequently amplified by a cryogenic ultra - low - noise amplifier , and the time transient is recorded and processed by a fast fourier transform ( fft ) spectrum analyzer .",
    "typical image currents are on the order of fa , therefore it is crucial to operate the detectors at high @xmath15 .",
    "+ when tuned to the resonance , the trapped particle is cooled resistively .",
    "once cooled to thermal equilibrium , the particle acts as a series @xmath30 circuit @xcite and shorts the resonator s impedance . this produces a sharp dip at the eigenfrequency of the antiproton in the thermal noise spectrum of the detector , as shown in fig.@xmath12 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is the ratio of the johnson - nyquist noise of the detector @xmath31 to the equivalent input noise of the amplifier @xmath16 , given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the boltzmann - constant , @xmath34 the effective parallel resistance of the whole system , @xmath35 the temperature of the detector , and @xmath36 the coupling factor between tuned circuit and cryogenic amplifier .",
    "note that high snrs can either be achieved by optimizing @xmath37 or by increasing the temperature of the system @xmath35 , e.g. by coupling external noise to the circuit .",
    "however , the second approach will also increase particle temperature and therefore systematic shifts in frequency measurements @xcite , which is to be avoided . by fitting a line - shape modeled dip to the measured spectrum",
    ", the axial frequency @xmath8 is obtained .",
    "the scatter @xmath38 of a sequence of axial frequency measurements @xmath39 is given as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the averaging time and @xmath42 the width of the particle dip .",
    "to enable fast particle detection with high frequency resolution , the snr should be as large as possible .",
    "in addition , by tuning @xmath34 and consequently @xmath17 , the frequency resolution at constant averaging time can be improved .",
    "each resonator consists of a toroidal coil in a cylindrical metal housing with an outer diameter @xmath43 , as shown in fig@xmath443 .",
    "the toroidal geometry confines the magnetic flux within the inductor , and consequently reduces losses caused by stray fields .",
    "the coils , as well as the housings , are made out of type - ii superconducting nbti .",
    "this material has a high critical magnetic field strength @xcite of @xmath45 t , which enables placement of the resonators close to the trap system mounted in the high magnetic field @xmath46 t of a superconducting magnet .",
    "+ in total four resonators were developed , two with an outer diameter of @xmath43=48@xmath1 mm and two with @xmath43=41@xmath1 mm , the dimensions being defined by geometrical constraints of the experiment .",
    "the geometry of the toroid was optimized in a way , such that the inner cross - sectional area is maximized at the shortest length of superconducting wire , when considering the boundary conditions defined by the housings .",
    "to keep the parasitic capacitance of the coil small , we use three - layer chamber windings .",
    "the individual chambers are machined onto the toroid .",
    "losses induced by dielectric polarization effects are kept small by making the cores of the toroids out of polytetrafluoroethylene ( ptfe ) . at cryogenic temperatures and in our frequency range of interest , this material has a dielectric loss tangent of @xmath47 , which is supported by the experimental results described below .",
    "+ for the superconducting wire , ptfe insulated nbti wire with a diameter of 75@xmath1 m is used .",
    "the windings are fixed to the core by ptfe thread - seal tape to ensure a good thermal contact between the wire and the ptfe core .",
    "this is crucial to allow appropriate thermalization . at each end of the coil",
    ", a 5@xmath1 cm long copper wire of 0.5@xmath1 mm diameter is connected . to keep resistive losses in the nb / ti - cu joint small ,",
    "we carefully degrease the respective metal contacts , place the ends in silver plated copper - ferrules add pb / sn solder and heat the joint slowly to 290@xmath48c .",
    "this toroid assembly is placed into ptfe holders , which are then mounted into the resonator housing .",
    "finally , one end of the coil is directly soldered to ground ( cold end ) , the other one is kept open , but efficiently thermalized by means of a custom - made sapphire capacitor .",
    "+ for experimental reasons , we designed for different axial frequencies in different traps , and as a consequence different inductances @xmath20 . in test experiments with copper wire we found that @xmath49 reproduces the measured inductances within an error of 10@xmath50 . here",
    "@xmath51 is the permeability constant of the vacuum , @xmath52 the cross - sectional area of a toroid , @xmath53 the radius of the central axis of a toroid , and @xmath54 the number of turns .",
    "+ for characterization the coils are cooled to 4@xmath1k and the @xmath55-transmission is measured using a vector network analyzer .",
    "the measurement setup is similar to the one described in our previous article @xcite . from the transmission the resonance frequency @xmath56 and the 3@xmath1db width @xmath57 are determined and the quality factor is calculated as @xmath58 .",
    "summarized results of these measurements are shown in table@xmath1i .",
    "+ for all unloaded resonators we achieve quality factors @xmath59 , corresponding to effective series resistances @xmath60 .",
    "these resistances may arise from residual losses in the dielectrics present in the resonator housing , as well as small residual resistances in the critical nbti - to - cu joints .",
    "however , the quality factors achieved here exceed the requirements of our trap - experiment by a factor of 10 and further optimization of the measured @xmath61 was not required .",

    "this principle allows the continuous tuning of the particle - detector interaction .",
    "however , compared to gaas - fet based @xmath18-switches or active feedback techniques @xcite , no parasitic parallel resistance or spurious thermal noise is added to the detection circuit .",

    "the black square markers represent the stability conditions achieved with the @xmath18-tuner turned off . while recording the data - sets represented by the red round and the blue triangle data - points , the @xmath18-tuner was adjusted to reduce the line - width of the single antiproton dip to @xmath71hz ( indicated by the red round plot ) and @xmath72hz ( blue triangle plot ) . for averaging times @xmath73s",
    ", the reduction of the axial frequency fluctuation fits the theoretical expectation as described by eq@xmath44(3 ) . at @xmath74s ,",
    "a random walk component , caused by drifts in the voltages which define the trapping potential , starts to contribute and modifies the @xmath75 scaling . in total , however , for a wide range of averaging times the use of the @xmath18-tuner reduces the axial frequency fluctuation @xmath76 as expected .",
    "therefore , by using this device all types of penning - trap experiments which rely on axial - dip measurements , such as proton and antiproton magnetic moment measurements @xcite and charge - to - mass ratio comparisons @xcite , as well as measurements of the @xmath4-factor of the electron bound to highly - charged ions , could potentially improve experimental precision when using such a device .",

    "we tune the detectors to @xmath78 and signal - to - noise ratios of 30@xmath1db . in addition",
    ", a newly developed superconducting switch enables us to tune the resonance widths of single particle noise dips , which significantly reduces measured axial frequency fluctuations at low averaging times , which will improve experimental precision in our future planned proton - to - antiproton magnetic moment and charge - to - mass ratio comparisons .",
