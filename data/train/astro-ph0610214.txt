    "all sky survey ( 2mass ; beichman et al .",
    "1998 , skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) have revealed large numbers of ultracool low - mass field dwarfs , known as l and t dwarfs .",
    "the effective temperatures ( @xmath8 ) of l dwarfs are @xmath92200  k , and those of currently known t dwarfs are @xmath101450  k ( golimowski et al .",
    "2004a , hereafter g04 ; vrba et al .  2004 ) .    as @xmath8 drops below that of the late - m dwarfs , the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of ultracool dwarfs",
    "are dramatically changed by chemical and cloud processes in their atmospheres .",
    "first , iron and silicate grains condense high in the atmosphere and form clouds that veil gaseous absorption bands and redden the near - infrared colors of l dwarfs .",
    "as @xmath8 falls , these clouds form progressively deeper in the atmosphere and become more optically thick .",
    "by @xmath111700  k , the effect of the clouds on the emergent flux is greatest ( ackerman & marley 2001 ) . at lower @xmath8 ,",
    "the clouds lie near or below the base of the wavelength - dependent photosphere and only marginally affect the flux distributions of t dwarfs .",
    "the rapidity , with respect to @xmath8 , with which the clouds diminish is not well understood and several mechanisms have been proposed ( e.g. burgasser et al .  2002b , burrows , sudarsky & hubeny  2006 , knapp et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter k04 ) .",
    "g04 showed that @xmath8 is nearly constant ( @xmath121500  k ) for spectral types l7 to t4 .",
    "thus , for these spectral types , the primary cause of the observed spectral change is apparently rapid alteration of the vertical properties and distribution of the cloud , over a small range in @xmath8 .",
    "the changing cloud properties alter the optical depths and brightness temperatures from which the flux emerges .",
    "as the clouds depart , the upper atmosphere cools and ch@xmath13 supplants co as the dominant carbon - bearing molecule .",
    "ch@xmath13 appears in the 34  @xmath1 m spectra of mid - l dwarfs ( noll et al .",
    "2000 ) , the 2.22.5 and @xmath14 m spectra of late - l dwarfs ( geballe et al .  2002 ; roellig et al .",
    "2004 ; cushing et al .",
    "2006 ) , and the @xmath15 m spectra of t0 dwarfs ( geballe et al .  2002 ) . together , increasing ch@xmath13 absorption and sinking cloud decks cause progressively bluer near - infrared colors of t dwarfs .",
    "over 500 ultracool field dwarfs have been confirmed and studied in the near - infrared ( e.g. burgasser et al .",
    "2006b , chiu et al .  2006",

    "our group has so far obtained accurate @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath7 photometry on the mauna kea observatories ( mko ) system ( simons & tokunaga 2002 , tokunaga et al .  2002 ) and @xmath18 , 0.92.5  @xmath1 m spectroscopy for 102 l dwarfs and 65 t dwarfs .",
    "this sample is summarized by k04 and c06 .",
    "leggett et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and g04 extended our study to longer wavelengths , presenting @xmath0 ( 3.75  @xmath1 m ) and @xmath2 ( 4.70  @xmath1 m ) photometry for a subset of the @xmath19 sample . in this paper",
    ", we extend our study further by presenting broadband photometry for wavelengths up to 7.9  @xmath1 m .",
    "the 315  @xmath1 m mid - infrared region is interesting for ultracool - dwarf studies for many reasons .",
    "this region contains molecular absorption bands of ch@xmath13 , co , h@xmath20o and nh@xmath21 ( cushing et al .  2006 ) that are prominent in the spectra of ultracool dwarfs at various temperatures",
    ". figure  1 shows observed and synthetic 310  @xmath1 m spectra for late - l and t dwarfs and identifies the principal absorbing species .",
    "the vibrotational line lists for ch@xmath13 , nh@xmath21 and h@xmath20o are more complete in the mid - infrared than the near - infrared , so the uncertainties in the synthetic mid - infrared spectra are smaller than those in the near - infrared spectra . also , the mid - infrared flux emerges from photospheric regions that have a much smaller range of brightness temperatures than those giving rise to the near - infrared flux ( ackerman & marley 2001 ) .",
    "hence the mid - infrared spectrum should be easier to interpret than the near - infrared spectrum .",
    "furthermore , mid - infrared photometry is more sensitive than near - infrared photometry to vertical mixing of trace species , which can result in photospheric chemical abundances very different from equilibrium ( saumon et al .  2003 ; g04 ) .",
    "obtaining mid - infrared photometry and spectroscopy with ground - based telescopes is difficult , due to the high and rapidly varying background at these wavelengths , and to the strong telluric absorption bands of ch@xmath13 , co , co@xmath20 , h@xmath20o , n@xmath20o and o@xmath21 . the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( werner et al .",
    "2003 ) has made possible observations at these and longer wavelengths that were previously impossible from the ground .",
    "we are using @xmath22 s infrared array camera ( irac ; fazio et al .",
    "2004 ) and infrared spectrograph ( irs ; houck et al .",
    "2004 ) to obtain 3.67.9  @xmath1 m photometry and 615  @xmath1 m low - resolution spectra of late - l and t dwarfs . in this paper",
    ", we present the irac results along with ground - based @xmath0 and @xmath2 photometry obtained using the near infrared imager and spectrograph ( niri ; hodapp et al .  2003 ) at the gemini ( north ) observatory .",
    "the irs spectra will be presented in a future paper .",
    "we obtained mko @xmath23 and/or @xmath24 images of 12 late - l and t dwarfs , listed in table 1 , on 10 dry and photometric nights between ut 2004 april 05 and ut 2005 january 28 .",

    "2002 ) are shown in figure  1 and listed in table  2 . because the sky is bright at these wavelengths",
    ", we used niri s smallest pixel scale ( 0022 pix@xmath6 ) to avoid saturating the detector .",
    "the full array readout was used , providing a field of view of 225  @xmath25  225 .",
    "given the small field of view , we acquired each target using proper - motion - corrected coordinates ( if available ) and a short @xmath16-band verification image . during the @xmath0 and @xmath2 exposures ,",
    "the target was sequentially offset from the center of the detector toward each of the four corners , generating a four - position dither pattern with @xmath26 offsets .",
    "offset guide stars were used . each @xmath23 image comprised 24 coadded exposures of 0.8  s , and each @xmath24 image comprised 34 coadded exposures of 0.5  s. the total observation time per target was typically 1.5  hr , most of which was spent on the @xmath24 exposures .",
    "each set of science images was accompanied by contemporaneous dark frames and images of bright photometric standard stars ( leggett et al .",
    "2003 ) taken with the same filters .",
    "flat fields were generated by median - stacking the dithered science images .",
    "the data were reduced using a version of the astronomical imaging pipeline orac - dr ( cavanagh et al .",
    "2003 ) modified for niri .",
    "the pipeline uses starlink routines to perform bad - pixel masking , dark subtraction , differencing of adjacent pairs , flat - field creation and division , feature detection and matching between object frames , and resampling .",
    "the final combined image , termed a mosaic , is generated with intensity offsets applied to give the most consistent results in the overlapping regions of the dithered images .",
    "pairwise differencing allows more accurate sky subtraction and flat - fielding , although it yields positive and negative images of each source in the mosaics .",
    "the mosaics were binned @xmath27 to enhance the visibility of the l and t dwarfs .",
    "the final pixel scale was therefore 0066  pix@xmath6 .",
    "we performed aperture photometry on both the positive and negative images of the l and t dwarfs using apertures of diameter @xmath28@xmath29 .",
    "we defined the uncertainty to be the difference between the measurements of the positive and negative images .",
    "this difference is similar to , or slightly larger than , the formal error calculated from the noise .",
    "table 1 lists the resulting @xmath23 and @xmath24 magnitudes , as well as any previously published measurements .",
    "henceforth , we use the weighted averages of the new and previously published measurements of all the dwarfs except 2mass j15031961 + 2525196 , whose previous uncertain @xmath2 measurement is discarded in favor of the niri value .",
    "we obtained irac four - channel photometry ( 3.55 , 4.49 , 5.73 , and 7.87  @xmath1 m ) of the nine l and t dwarfs listed in table  3 between ut 2005 july 23 and ut 2006 july 06 .",
    "the data were obtained as part of our cycle  2 _ spitzer _ general observer program # 20514 .",
    "the half - power bandpasses for the four channels are listed in table  2 and indicated in figure  1 .",
    "all four channels have 256@xmath25256-pixel detectors with a pixel size of 12@xmath2512 , yielding a 52@xmath2552 field of view .",
    "two adjacent fields are imaged in pairs ( channels 1 and 3 ; channels 2 and 4 ) using dichroic beam splitters .",
    "the telescope is then nodded to image a target in all four channels .",
    "we used exposure times of 30  s and a 5-position medium - sized ( 52 pixels ) dither pattern repeated one to four times . the total observing time per target ranged from 11 to 26  minutes .",
    "the full array was read out .",
    "the data were reduced using the post - basic - calibration data mosaics generated by version 14 of the irac pipeline .",
    "the mosaics were flat - fielded and flux - calibrated using super - flats and global primary and secondary standards observed by @xmath22 .",
    "we performed aperture photometry on the l and t dwarfs using apertures of radii 37 pixels .",
    "the dwarfs were usually isolated and well detected , so apertures of 7 pixels could be used .",
    "we applied channel - dependent aperture corrections as described in chapter  5 of the irac data handbook.@xmath30 for channels 1 to 3 , the correction for the 7-pixel aperture is 3% , for the 5-pixel aperture it is 56% and for the 3-pixel aperture it is 1112% . for channel 4 , these corrections are 4% , 7% , and 22% .",
    "we derived photometric errors from the uncertainty images that are provided with the post - basic - calibration data .",
    "the photometry was converted from millijanskys to magnitudes on the vega system using the zero - magnitude fluxes given in the irac data handbook ( 280.9 , 179.7 , 115.0 , and 64.1 jy for channels 1 to 4 , respectively ) .",
    "the fluxes , magnitudes , and errors for the observed dwarfs are given in table  3 .",
    "note that in addition to the errors in table  3 , there are absolute calibration uncertainties of 23% .",
    "there are also similarly - sized systematic uncertainties introduced by pipeline dependencies , as we found by comparing the photometry produced by pipeline versions 12 , 13 and 14 for seven of our targets .",
    "photometry produced by versions 12 and 14 agreed well , to typically 4% , however version 13 produced fainter magnitudes than the other two pipelines , by @xmath317% .",
    "the spitzer helpdesk team recommend version 14 of the pipeline , and suggest that version 13 used an over - aggressive pixel rejection algorithm .",
    "we adopt the total photometric uncertainty to be the sum in quadrature of the values given in table  3 plus 3% .",
    "irac flux densities follow the convention established by the _ infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) _ and other missions .",
    "the irac flux density at a nominal wavelength assumes that the source has a spectrum described by @xmath32 .",
    "however , this assumption is not valid for the seds of late - l and t dwarfs ( figure  1 ) ; @xmath33 is not constant in these cases .",
    "hence the fluxes given in table  3 are not representative of the nominal wavelengths given in table  2 .",
    "for example , the 3.55  @xmath1 m and 7.87  @xmath1 m irac fluxes of the l9 dwarf shown in figure  1 differ by @xmath34% and @xmath35% , respectively , from the actual fluxes at those wavelengths measured by _ spitzer s _ irs .",
    "if the source spectrum is known , the quoted irac flux for a nominal wavelength @xmath36 can be expressed as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the source spectrum and @xmath39 is the system response function ( cushing et al .",
    "2006 ) .    to put our data into context , we augment our sample with the irac photometry of m , l , and t dwarfs from patten et al .",

    "figure  2 shows the differences between irac channel 1 ( 3.55  @xmath1 m ) and mko @xmath0 ( 3.75  @xmath1 m ) magnitudes and between irac channel 2 ( 4.49  @xmath1 m ) and mko @xmath2 ( 4.70  @xmath1 m ) magnitudes , as functions of spectral type .",

    "irac channels 1 and 2 span wavelengths similar to those of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively ( figure 1 ) , and correlations can be used to check the consistency of _ spitzer _ and ground - based data .",
    "figure  2 shows that the irac channel  1 magnitudes ( denoted [ 3.55 ] ) become fainter than @xmath0 magnitudes for later spectral types .",
    "this behavior is expected because channel  1 samples more of the strong center of the 3.3  @xmath1 m ch@xmath13 absorption band , and less of its long - wavelength wing and flux peak near 4  @xmath1 m , compared to the @xmath23 bandpass ( see figure  1 ) .",

    ". the models also allow opacity from arbitrary mie - scattering particles .",
    "the radiative transfer code is closely coupled to cloud models that use a sedimentation efficiency parameter , @xmath47 , to describe the balance between the downward sedimentation of condensates and the upward convection that replenishes the grains .",
    "large values of @xmath47 correspond to rapid growth of large grains , which then quickly fall out of the atmosphere and yield physically and optically thin clouds .",
    "when @xmath47 is small , the grains grow more slowly and the clouds are thicker .",
    "the models have been successfully applied to the atmospheres of brown dwarfs and jupiter ( ackerman & marley 2001 ; k04 ; g04 ) .",
    "the models have been further advanced to include vertical mixing , which draws up chemical species from the well - mixed , deep , hot layers into the cool radiative photosphere .",
    "although the photosphere would be expected to be stable and in chemical equilibrium , even a small degree of mixing ( such as is commonly observed in the stratospheres of the solar system s giant planets ) enhances the abundances of stable species like co and n@xmath20 relative to their chemical equilibrium values , while those of h@xmath20o , ch@xmath13 and nh@xmath21 are reduced ( fegley & lodders 1996 , lodders & fegley 2002 , saumon et al .",

    "we treat the dynamical parameters , @xmath52 and @xmath47 , as independent variables , in the same way as we treat @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "however , the global properties of each dwarf must ultimately define the true properties of the cloud , and the vigor of atmospheric mixing .",
    "two otherwise identical l dwarfs , for example , could not exhibit two different sedimentation efficiencies and eddy diffusion coefficients . eventually we will be able to treat @xmath52 and @xmath47 as functions of other physical properties , but this can not happen until we understand how differences in metallicity , rotation rate , effective temperature , and gravity impact sedimentation and mixing in the atmosphere .",

    "finally we note that because the models are complex and cpu - intensive , not all combinations of all parameters are available at this time .",

    "this limitation does not affect our analysis or conclusions because the condensate cloud decks are expected to lie below the photosphere for @xmath67k .",
    "consequently , we do not consider inappropriate dusty models for mid- to late - t dwarfs or cloudless models for early- to mid - l dwarfs .",
    "all model sequences assume solar metallicity , except for one metal - poor cloudless sequence .",

    "the relative strengths of absorption bands in the spectrum are complex functions of all these parameters . for the sake of brevity and clarity",

    "the @xmath7-band flux is sensitive to gravity because it corresponds to a peak in the h@xmath20 cia opacity .",
    "this opacity depends quadratically on the gas number density , unlike most other opacity sources that are roughly linear functions of the density .",
    "higher gravities cause higher photospheric pressures and a greater cia opacity , which depresses the @xmath7-band flux . figures 4a and 4b indeed show redder @xmath7@xmath76 and @xmath7[3.55 ] colors as @xmath77 increases .",
    "only the coolest t dwarfs are affected , however , because at higher @xmath8 the h@xmath20o opacity in the @xmath7-band increases and cia is no longer dominant .",
    "the effect of gravity on the irac colors ( figures 4c and 4d ) is more subtle , and the cause varies with @xmath8 or spectral type .",
    "the chemistry of ch@xmath13 and ph@xmath21 , and the temperature - pressure profile , are all dependent on gravity .",
    "the net result is bluer [ 4.49][5.73 ] colors as gravity increases , for @xmath781400  k , or late - l and all t types .",

    "figures 4 and 5 show that the models with reasonable ranges of @xmath77 , @xmath47 , and [ m / h ] do not reproduce the observed colors of l and t dwarfs very well , although the general trends with @xmath8 are satisfactory .",

    "it is also puzzling that the wide ranges of parameters considered so far are unable to reproduce the range in the observed colors of l dwarfs , shown as triangles in figures 4 and 5 .",
