    "it is well appreciated that galaxy clusters are powerful tools for cosmological studies , especially through their halo mass function and global baryon fractions  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to obtain mass measurements of ever larger numbers of cluster masses at higher redshifts , studies must resort to global scaling relations , often involving proxies for the mass .",
    "global scaling relations of icm properties are particularly useful to probe cooling and feedback in cluster evolution . measurements of global scaling relations must be interpreted within the context of a general paradigm ( e.g. , @xmath15cdm ) that makes definite assumptions about the full radial structure of a halo .",
    "it is essential that those assumptions be verified for as many systems as possible through detailed radial mapping of halo properties .",
    "fortunately , there are several powerful probes of cluster mass distributions ( e.g. , galaxy kinematics , icm temperature and density profiles , gravitational lensing , sz effect ) which , ideally , can be combined to achieve the most accurate picture of cluster structure  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in practice ,",
    "different techniques are better suited for particular clusters because of multiple factors , such as distance and mass .",
    "well - known advantages of studying the icm include ( 1 ) that it traces the three - dimensional cluster potential well ; ( 2 ) the electron mean free path is sufficiently short ( especially when considering the presence of weak magnetic fields ) to guarantee the fluid approximation holds ( i.e. , with an isotropic pressure tensor ) ; and ( 3 ) the hydrostatic equilibrium approximation should apply within the virialized region , allowing the gravitating mass to be derived directly from the temperature and density profiles of the icm  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since clusters are still forming in the present epoch , deviations from the hydrostatic approximation are expected .",
    "cosmological simulations expect typically 10%-30% of the total icm pressure is non - thermal , primarily arising from random turbulent motions  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even with the very unfortunate demise of _ astro - h _ , eventually microcalorimeter detectors will provide for the first time precise direct measurements of icm kinematics for many bright clusters , greatly reducing ( or eliminating ) this greatest source of systematic error in icm studies  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "even so , for the most reliable hydrostatic analysis it is desirable that the correction for non - thermal pressure be as small as possible ; i.e. , for the most relaxed systems .    it turns out to be difficult to find clusters with undisturbed icm within their entire virial region .",
    "the clusters that tend to be the most dynamically relaxed over most of their virial region are the cool core clusters which , unfortunately , are also those that most often display icm disturbances in their central regions believed to arise from intermittent feedback from an agn in the central galaxy  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hence , cc clusters with the least evidence for central icm disturbance are probably the best clusters for hydrostatic studies .",
    "the cool core fossil cluster  is especially well - suited for hydrostatic studies of its icm .",
    "it is both sufficiently bright and distant @xmath16 allowing for its entire virial region to be mapped through a combination of  and  observations with feasible total exposure time .",
    "the high - quality  image reveals a highly regular icm with no evidence of large , asymmetrical disturbances anywhere , including the central regions  @xcite .",
    "we have  observations covering the entire region within @xmath4 on the sky and presented results for the icm properties in each of four directions ( including using the central  observation ) in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  1 ) .",
    "we found the icm properties ( e.g , temperature , density ) to display only very modest azimuthal variations ( @xmath17 ) , providing evidence for a highly relaxed icm .    in this second paper on the entire virial radius of  we focus on measurements of the bcg stellar mass - to - light ratio , dark matter , gas , and baryon fraction . whereas paper  1 focused on the comparison of icm properties obtained for each of the four directions observed by , here we analyze results for all the directions together to obtain the best - fitting azimuthally averaged icm and mass properties .",
    "for calculating distances we assumed a flat @xmath15cdm cosmology with @xmath18 and @xmath19  km  s@xmath20  mpc@xmath20 . at the redshift of  ( @xmath21 ) this translates to an angular - diameter distance of @xmath22  mpc and @xmath23  kpc .",
    "unless stated otherwise , all statistical uncertainties quoted in this paper are @xmath24 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we review very briefly the observations , data preparation , and icm measurements in  [ obs ] .",
    "we discuss our implementation of the hydrostatic method in  [ method ] and define the particular models and parameters in  [ mod ] .",
    "we present the results in  [ results ] and describe the construction of the systematic error budget in  [ sys ] .",
    "finally , in  [ disc ] we discuss several implications of our results and present our summary and conclusions in  [ conc ] .",
    "the observations and data preparation are reported in paper  1 , and we refer the interested reader to that paper for details . briefly , after obtaining cleaned events files for each observation , we extracted spectra in several concentric circular annuli for each data set and constructed appropriate response files for each annulus ; i.e. , redistribution matrix files ( rmfs ) and auxiliary response files ( arfs , including `` mixing '' arfs to account for the large , energy - dependent point spread function of the  data ) .",
    "we constructed model  spectra representing the `` non - cosmic '' x - ray background ( nxb ) and subtracted these from the observations .",
    "all other background components for both the  and data were accounted for with simple parameterized models fitted directly to the observations using  v12.7.2  @xcite ; i.e. , the annular spectrum of each data set was fitted individually with a complex spectral model consisting of components for the icm and background . for each annulus on the sky a single thermal plasma component ( vapec )",
    "was fitted to represent all the icm emission in that annulus .",
    "no deprojection was performed during the spectral fitting because it amplifies noise and renders the analysis of the background - dominated cluster outskirts even more challenging .",
    "furthermore , standard deprojection algorithms ( e.g. , onion - peeling and projct in ) do not generally account for icm emission outside the bounding annulus , which also can lead to sizable systematic effects  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , the principal data products resulting from our analysis are the radial profiles of projected ( 1 ) emission - weighted temperature and ( 2 ) emissivity - weighted @xmath25 ; e.g. , equations b10 and b13 of @xcite .",
    "in addition , we also use the profile of projected , emission - weighted iron abundance ( @xmath26 ) expressed in solar units  @xcite to further constrain the emissivity in our hydrostatic models .",
    "we prefer to construct hydrostatic equilibrium models using an approach that begins by specifying a parameterized model for the icm entropy  @xcite .",
    "the benefits of this `` entropy - based '' approach , as well as a review of other methods , are presented in @xcite . compared to the temperature and density ,",
    "the entropy profile is more slowly varying and has a well - motivated asymptotic form , @xmath27 for all clusters  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , by requiring the entropy to be a monotonically increasing function of radius , the additional contraint of convective stability ( not typically applied in cluster mass studies ) is easily enforced .",
    "we assume spherical symmetry which , if in fact the cluster is a triaxial ellipsoid , introduces only modest biases into the inferred parameters ( see  [ sys.sphere ] ) .    for studies of cluster icm the thermodynamic entropy",
    "is usually replaced by the entropy proxy , @xmath28 expressed in units of kev  @xmath29 .",
    "it is useful to define the quantity , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mean atomic mass of the icm and @xmath32 is the atomic mass unit , that replaces @xmath33 in the entropy proxy with @xmath34  ( e.g. , using eqn .",

    "we instead employ an iterative solution of eqn .",
    "( [ eqn.he ] ) by treating @xmath46 as a small perturbation .",
    "we solve eqn.([eqn.he ] ) initially by setting @xmath49 . from this solution we use the new @xmath34 to compute the profile of @xmath46 .",
    "we then insert it into the hydrostatic equation and obtain an improved solution .",
    "the process is repeated until the value of @xmath46 near the virial radius changes by less than a desired amount .",
    "a boundary condition on @xmath43 must be specified to obtain a unique solution of eqn .",
    "( [ eqn.he ] ) .",
    "we choose to specify the `` reference pressure , '' @xmath50 , at a radius of 10  kpc .",
    "hence , the free parameters in our hydrostatic model are @xmath50 and those associated with @xmath42 and @xmath39 , which we detail below in  [ mod ] .    to compare to the observations , the three - dimensional density and temperature profiles of the icm obtained from eqn .",
    "( [ eqn.he ] ) are used to construct the volume emissivity , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the icm plasma emissivity .",
    "then @xmath53 and the emission - weighted temperature are projected on to the sky and averaged over the various circular annuli corresponding to the x - ray data using equations b10 and b13 of @xcite . since @xmath52 also depends on the metal abundances , we need to specify the abundance profiles in our models . as in our previous studies , we obtain best results by simply using the measured abundance profiles in projection and assigning them to be the true three - dimensional profiles for the models .",
    "( the iron abundance profiles are presented in fig .  3 of @xcite and fig .",
    "13 of paper  1 . ) in  [ mischm ] we discuss instead using a parameterized model for the iron abundance that is emission - weighted and projected onto the sky and fitted to the observations .    since the x - ray emission in each annulus on the sky generally contains the sum of a range of temperatures and metallicities owing to radial gradients in the icm properties , the values in particular of the temperature and metallicity obtained by fitting single - component icm models to the projected spectra can be substantially biased with respect to the emission - weighted values  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the result we obtained for  in  [ mass ] is a @xmath223 discrepancy , providing even stronger evidence for an above - average concentration in a fossil cluster , suggestive of a halo that formed earlier than the general population .",
    "( we note that we have not included adiabatic contraction  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the dm halo in our model which would lead to an even larger concentration . )",
    "we caution , however , that as noted in  [ mass ] , when the einasto dm model is employed the significance of  as an outlier is somewhat reduced .",
    "it is also worth emphasizing that from the perspective of relaxed , low - redshift x - ray clusters , the concentration of  is not very remarkable .",
    "the only study that has measured the x - ray concentration - mass relation for a sizable number of relaxed systems having masses both lower and higher than  is @xcite , which also included the measurement of  by @xcite .",
    "our value for  is only @xmath384 larger than the mean relation obtained by  @xcite .",
    "the higher normalization of the x - ray concentration - mass relation can be explained by including reasonable star formation and feedback in the cluster simulations  @xcite which are not present in the dm - only simulations of  @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have used gas masses inferred from  and total masses from weak lensing to measure gas fractions at @xmath356 for a large cluster sample .",
    "they conclude that the gas fractions measured in this way are significantly smaller than those obtained from hydrostatic studies  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by assuming the weak lensing masses are accurate ,",
    "@xcite infer a hydrostatic mass bias of @xmath385 .",
    "when compared to numerical hydrodynamical simulations @xcite , the small gas fractions obtained by @xcite favor an extreme feedback model in which a substantial amount of baryons are ejected from cluster cores .    from our hydrostatic analysis of",
    "we measured within a radius @xmath356 : @xmath386 and @xmath387 ( tables  [ tab.mass ] and [ tab.fb ] ) . for this value of @xmath127 ,",
    "the best - fitting relation for the gas fraction obtained by @xcite gives @xmath388 implying a hydrostatic mass bias of @xmath389 .",
    "since the wealth of evidence indicates the icm in  is very relaxed ( see below in  [ he ] ) , including that the value of @xmath390 we measure agrees much better with the cluster gas fractions produced in the simulations of @xcite considering plausible cooling and supernova feedback , we do not believe such a large hydrostatic mass bias in  is supported by the present observations .",
    "instead , we believe these results for  support the suggestion by @xcite that the weak lensing masses are biased high .      as we have noted previously in the related context of elliptical galaxies ( see  8.2.2.1 of  @xcite ) , even without possessing direct , precise measurements of the hot gas kinematics , it is still possible to identify relaxed systems where the hydrostatic equilibrium approximation should be most accurate .",
    "is a cool core cluster and displays a very regular x - ray image from the smallest scales probed by  ( with little or no evidence for agn - induced disturbances ) out to @xmath4 .",
    "the  images mapping the radial region from @xmath391 with full azimuthal coverage display remarkably homogeneous icm properties ( paper  1 ) .",
    "we are able to obtain a good representation of the x - ray data with hydrostatic models with reasonable values for the model parameters : ( 1 ) the stellar mass - to - light ratio is consistent with stellar population synthesis models (  [ mass ] ) ; ( 2 ) the value of the concentration , while statistically higher than the expected mean of the halo population , is within the @xmath228 cosmological intrinsic scatter (  [ mass ] ) , and , at any rate , deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium due to additional non - thermal pressure support should tend to produce anomalously low , not high , concentrations by leading to smaller inferences of the virial mass and radius ( e.g. , see discussion in  6.2 of @xcite ) ; and ( 3 ) the baryon fraction is consistent with the cosmic value .",
    "although it is tempting to ascribe the very relaxed state of  to it being a fossil cluster , recent evidence suggests that the x - ray properties of fossil systems are not significantly distinguishable from the general cluster population  @xcite .",
    "the apparently highly relaxed icm within @xmath4 implies that non - thermal pressure support is small throughout the cluster and , as such , constrains theories that predict a large amount of non - thermal pressure support from the magneto - thermal instability ( mti ) in the icm outside of @xmath356  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we present a detailed hydrostatic analysis of the icm of the fossil cluster , , a system especially well - suited for study of its mass distribution with current x - ray observations . at a redshift of",
    "0.081 it is sufficiently distant to allow mapping of its entire virial region on the sky with reasonable exposures , while still being close enough to spatially resolve the central regions near the bcg .",
    "previous studies have shown this cluster to have a remarkably regular and undisturbed icm  @xcite . in paper  1",
    "we presented three new  observations in the south , east , and west directions , which , in conjunction with the existing pointing to the north and central  data , allow complete azimuthal and radial coverage on the sky within @xmath4 .",
    "our separate analysis of the icm in each of the four directions found the icm properties to be very homogenous in azimuth , testifying to the relaxed state of the icm out to @xmath4 ( see paper  1 ) .",
    "we constructed hydrostatic models and fitted them simultaneously to the projected icm temperature and emission measure ( @xmath392 ) measured individually for each  and  observation ( see paper  1 ) .",
    "we employ an `` entropy - based '' procedure  @xcite where the hydrostatic equilibrium equation is expressed in terms of the entropy proxy @xmath42 and total mass , which allows the additional contraint of convective stability ( @xmath393 ) to be easily enforced .",
    "our fiducial model consists of a power - law with two breaks and a constant for @xmath42 , a sersic model for the stellar mass of the bcg , and an nfw dm halo .",
    "we explore the parameter space and determine confidence limits using a bayesian monte carlo procedure and find the fiducial model is a good fit to the data .",
    "we constructed a detailed budget of systematic errors (  [ sys ] ) to assess the impact that different data analysis and modeling choices have on our measurements .",
    "the largest systematic effects are associated with the background spectral models , metal abundances , and modeling the plasma emissivity variation with radius .",
    "these effects are most significant at the largest radii , although none of them change qualitatively the results of the fiducial model .      * * entropy * the radial entropy profile of the icm is described well by the power - law model with either one or two breaks . when rescaled in terms of the `` virial '' entropy @xmath394",
    ", the entropy exceeds the @xmath27 profile predicted by pure gravitational formation until @xmath395 , but does not fall below it at any radius .",
    "further rescaling of the entropy by @xmath396 matches very well the @xmath27 profile , suggesting that feedback has spatially redistributed the icm rather than raised its temperature  @xcite . *",
    "* pressure * the radial pressure profile expressed in terms of @xmath122 slightly exceeds the mean``universal '' pressure profile of  @xcite , but is consistent within the scatter of that profile . * * bcg stellar mass & dissipation scale * the stellar mass of the bcg is clearly required by the model fits and yields a @xmath0-band stellar mass - to - light ratio , @xmath397 , consistent with stellar population synthesis models for a milky - way imf .",
    "this makes  along with a262  @xcite the most massive clusters where x - ray studies have measured such a distinct bcg stellar component and supports recent work  @xcite suggesting that @xmath14 represents the mass scale above which dissipation does not dominate the formation of the inner regions of clusters (  [ bcg ] ) . * * dark matter profiles * despite the high - quality x - ray data covering the entire region within @xmath4 , our model fits do not statistically distinguish between nfw , einasto @xmath234 , or corelog ( singular isothermal sphere with a core ) profiles for the dm halo .",
    "this contrasts with clusters much more massive than where previous x - ray studies  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) clearly disfavor pseudo - isothermal models in favor of nfw , which is also found by recent results from the clash survey from gravitational lensing analysis of several very massive clusters  @xcite . allowing the einasto index @xmath233 to be free",
    "does not improve the fit significantly and yields , @xmath398 or @xmath399 , very consistent with the values expected for a dm halo of the mass of  @xcite .",
    "* * high concentration * for the fiducial model ( i.e. , with an nfw profile ) we obtain @xmath400 and @xmath401 .",
    "the concentration exceeds the value of 5.2 expected for the mean relaxed cluster population in the _ planck _",
    "cosmology  @xcite by @xmath223 .",
    "it is also a @xmath402 outlier considering the intrinsic scatter of the theoretical relation , although the discrepancy is reduced to a little more than a @xmath24 outlier when the einasto dm profile is used .",
    "these properties make  the most significant over - concentrated fossil cluster to date ( see  [ highc ] ) , indicating an earlier formation time than the average cluster at its redshift .",
    "however , with respect to a sample of relaxed , low - redshift galaxy systems studied in x - rays spanning a mass range of @xmath403 , the concentration of  is only @xmath384 above the mean relation of @xcite .",
    "* * gas and baryon fraction * considering only the baryons associated with the icm and the bcg , we obtain a baryon fraction at @xmath4 , @xmath5 , that is slightly below the _ planck _  value ( 0.155 ) for the universe , but the baryon fraction continues to rise with radius so that , @xmath404 at @xmath405 . taking into account estimates for the stellar baryons associated with non - central galaxies and intracluster light ( icl ) increases these values by @xmath7 , in which case @xmath244 marginally exceeds ( by @xmath228 ) the cosmic value . since our estimate of the icl mass is very uncertain , we do not consider the disagreement to be significant ; i.e. , the baryon fraction is consistent with the cosmic value and therefore no significant baryon loss from the system . * * slope of the total mass profile * the total mass profile is nearly a power - law over radii @xmath406 with a slope ranging from @xmath324 and density slope @xmath10 ranging from -1.6 to -2.0 . within @xmath329 ,",
    "the mass - weighted slope of the total density profile , @xmath330 , is consistent with the value @xmath332 obtained using the @xmath11 scaling relation  @xcite . * * mond * following the procedure of @xcite using a particular simple interpolating function @xmath337 , we computed mass profiles in the context of mond .",
    "we find that mond requires dm fractions nearly as large as for conventional newton gravity : at @xmath13  kpc the dm fraction is @xmath12 implying a mass discrepancy of a factor of 6.7 .",
    "the dm fraction decreases to @xmath347 considering the ( rather uncertain ) contribution of non - central stellar baryons (  [ sys.stars ] ) .",
    "therefore , consistent with previous results for other x - ray groups and clusters , mond requires a large dm fraction to explain the x - ray data .    in sum , our hydrostatic analysis of the icm emission within @xmath4 yields baryon and dm properties quite consistent with typical clusters for its virial mass in the @xmath15cdm paradigm .",
    "the only notable exception is the higher - than - average nfw concentration parameter that , nevertheless , is not unreasonable for a fossil system expected to form earlier than the general cluster population .",
    "hence , appears to be an optimal , benchmark cluster for hydrostatic studies of its icm .",
