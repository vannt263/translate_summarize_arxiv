    "<S> the residual symmetry approach , along with a complex extension for some flavor invariance , is a powerful tool to uncover the flavor structure of the @xmath0 neutrino majorana mass matrix @xmath1 towards gaining insights into neutrino mixing . </S>",
    "<S> we utilize this to propose a complex extension of the real scaling ansatz for @xmath1 which was introduced some years ago . </S>",
    "<S> unlike the latter , our proposal allows a nonzero mass for each of the three light neutrinos as well as a nonvanishing @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the generation of light neutrino masses via type - i seesaw mechanism is also demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> a major result of this scheme is that leptonic dirac cp - violation must be maximal while atmospheric neutrino mixing need not be exactly maximal . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , each of the two allowed majorana phases , to be probed by the search for nuclear @xmath3 decay , has to be at one of its two cp - conserving values . </S>",
    "<S> there are other interesting consequences such as the allowed occurrence of a normal mass ordering which is not favored by the real scaling ansatz . </S>",
    "<S> our predictions will be tested in ongoing and future neutrino oscillation experiments at t2k , no@xmath4a and dune .    </S>",
