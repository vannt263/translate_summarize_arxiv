    "in most well observed low mass x - ray binaries , oscillations of the x - ray flux at frequencies near 1 khz have been measured with rossi x - ray timing explorer ( for reviews and references see van der klis 1998 , swank 1998 ) .",
    "models describing the production of these quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) are not yet definitive , but the fast signals most likely originate in the interesting region of the accretion disk very close to the compact object where the dynamical timescale is short .    the goal of this paper is to explore the link between the kilohertz qpos and the broadband timing properties in an x  ray binary .",
    "these timing signals may well be related .",
    "a common dependence on mass accretion rate is suggested , since the strength of the low frequency noise decreases with accretion rate while the frequency of the kilohertz qpos is expected to increase in current models .",
    "the timing features at tens of hertz may also be related to the kilohertz qpos , as in the lense  thirring precession model of stella & vietri ( 1997 ) or the oscillation mode model of titarchuk , lapidus & muslimov ( 1998 ) .    for this analysis we use rxte observations of 4u",
    "172834 ( gx  354 + 0 ) which have recently become public .",
    "analysis of the kilohertz qpos in these observations was reported by strohmayer et al .",
    "section  2 summarizes the observations and our analysis of the fourier power spectra . in section  3",
    "we present the correlations between the frequencies of the noise components .",
    "section  4 is a discussion of the results and the physical implications .",
    "the present rxte observations of 4u  172834 took place between 1996 february 15 and march 1 and consist of approximately 298 ksec of usable data .",
    "we use here data from the proportional counter array ( pca ; for more instrument information see zhang et al .",
    "we generate fourier power spectra from the high time resolution data , which consists variously of a ` single - bit ' or an ` event ' mode .",
    "the time resolutions in these modes range from 1.2 to 122 @xmath1sec ; we use a maximum nyquist frequency of 4096  hz .",
    "we employ all the channels of the pca , most sensitive in the 230 kev band .",
    "there are 12 x - ray bursts ( strohmayer , zhang & swank 1997 ) .",
    "we exclude these from our analysis , excising 300 sec of data after each burst .",
    "four representative power spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : pds ] .",
    "we have arrived at a simple function that describes all the power spectra well .",
    "the components are ( _ i _ ) a broken power law with a break frequency whose best  fit value ranges between 1 and 50 hz , ( _ ii _ ) the kilohertz qpos , described by lorentzians with best  fit centroid values from 325 to 1127  hz and ( _ iii _ ) a low  frequency lorentzian with a best  fit frequency from 10 to 50 hz and @xmath2 ( full width at half maximum ) between 3 and 30 hz .",
    "in addition to these three components we find excess power near 100 hz .",
    "we include this in the fit as ( _ iv _ ) another lorentzian , with a best  fit frequency of about 150 hz ( @xmath2 : 10300 hz ) . including the fourth component does not significantly change the best  fit values of the other components .",
    "all the parameters are allowed to vary independently , and the reduced @xmath3 for the fits are typically 1.0 to 1.3 with about 200 degrees of freedom .",
    "table  1 shows the parameters for the fits to the power spectra in figure  [ fig : pds ] .",
    "other atoll sources also show these same components in their power spectra , as seen with ginga observations of 4u  1608 - 52 ( yoshida et al .",
    "1993 ) and rxte observations of 4u  1705 - 44 ( ford et al . 1998 ) , 4u0614 + 091 ( ford 1997 , mendez et al .",
    "1997 , van straaten et al . 1998 ) and 4u  1608 - 52 ( mendez et al .",
    "1998 ) . in the following",
    "we discuss in turn the properties of each of the components of the fits .",
    "the broken power law has components similar to previous measurements of other atoll sources .",
    "the parameters of the broken power law indicate that that 4u  172834 is in the ` island ' state in all these observations , i.e. at relatively low inferred mass accretion rate ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "the measurement of the break frequency is very robust , and usually independent of the lorentzian components that we add to the fit .",
    "the low - frequency lorentzian feature at 10 to 50 hz is a necessary addition to the fits . taking the february 18 interval shown in figure  [ fig : pds ] as an example , we find that removing the low - frequency lorentzian increases the @xmath3/dof from 275/223 to 439/226 . the probability for random variations to exceed the corresponding f value is @xmath4 , indicating that the inclusion of this lorentzian is strongly favored . in the march 1 and february 22 to 24 observations",
    "this feature is quite wide . with a value for @xmath5 ( = fwhm/@xmath6 ) of @xmath7",
    ", it does not constitute a qpo in the usual sense .",
    "the final component in the spectral fits are the kilohertz qpos , which have properties similar to those in other low mass x - ray binaries ( van der klis 1998 ) .",
    "only one qpo is visible in all intervals except the 16 february observations . in the cases where there is only one qpo",
    ", we treat it as the higher frequency qpo .",
    "the main justification for this , is that then all the data follow one correlation of frequency versus spectral shape ( kaaret et al .",
    "the qpos are quite wide on march 1 , with a @xmath5 of about 1 .",
    "we note that there are indications of additional features in the power spectra , for example two possible peaks on top of the low ",
    "frequency lorentzian in 1 mar or 24 feb . in these cases",
    "our adopted four component fit function is not entirely descriptive , but the extra features are not well constrained by the data .",
    "figure  [ fig : nuhi_nulo ] shows the relation between the low  frequency lorentzian and the kilohertz qpo .",
    "the relation between the two frequencies can be described by a power law scaling of the form @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the frequency of the low - frequency lorentzian and @xmath10 is the centroid frequency of the kilohertz qpo .",
    "we find @xmath11 and @xmath12 , excluding the 16 february intervals ( see below ) .",
    "the @xmath13 of this fit is large , 4.7 , which probably is a result of not including systematic errors to take into account the small inadequacies in the power spectral fit function as discussed above .",
    "the error on the power law fit is not accurate due to the large @xmath3 .",
    "to arrive at a more realistic value , we multiply all data errors by a factor of two making @xmath14 . the quoted errors ( also above ) use this procedure and @xmath15 .",
    "the second notable correlation is between the kilohertz qpos and the break frequency of the broken power law , as shown in figure  [ fig : nu_break ] .",
    "we describe the correlation by a function of the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the break frequency . using the same procedure outlined above , and again excluding the 16 february intervals , we find @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "as the frequency of the break increases other parameters change as well . the level of the noise at low frequency decreases and the count rate increases .",
    "the relation between the rms fraction and the break frequency consistent with that found for the black hole candidates ( mendez & van der klis 1997 ) .",
    "the only exceptions to the above correlations are in the 16 february data set .",
    "this observation is at the highest count rate , with presumably the highest accretion rate and highest break frequency .",
    "however , the best  fit values for both the break frequency and the low ",
    "frequency lorentzian are lower than would be expected .",
    "perhaps these two components are not well separated in the fits , or perhaps the lorentzian is another component different than any of the four components that we use in fitting the other data ( e.g. a harmonic ? ) . based on the present data ,",
    "it is not clear if the 16 february observations represent fundamentally different spectra .",
    "we fit them in the same way but treat the results on somewhat different footing .",
    "the previous section demonstrates a strong correlation between the frequencies of the kilohertz qpos and the frequencies of both the break and the low  frequency lorentzian , even though these features are independently determined in the power spectra .    the low ",
    "frequency lorentzian in this atoll source appears to be very similar to the horizontal branch oscillation ( hbo ) in z  sources . in particular , the correlation with the kilohertz qpos is nearly identical in gx17 + 2 ( wijnands et al .",
    "1997 ) , gx5 - 1 ( wijnands et al .",
    "1998 ) and sco  x-1 ( van der klis et al . 1997 ) .",
    "this suggests that these signals have a similar origin in both atoll and z  sources , and calls into question the magnetospheric beat - frequency model long used to explain the hbos ( alpar & shaham 1985 ) . if this model is to account for the low ",
    "frequency signals in atoll sources , where the mass accretion rate is roughly 100 times lower , the magnetic field must be 10 times smaller .",
    "this is probably not consistent with the low fields inferred for the accreting x  ray pulsar sax j1808.4 - 3658 ( wijnands & van der klis 1998a ) , which is similar to atoll sources in other respects ( wijnands & van der klis 1998b ) .",
    "stella & vietri ( 1998 ) have proposed that the low ",
    "frequency lorentzian feature is a result of relativistic frame dragging in the inner accretion disk ( lense  thirring precession ) .",
    "the frequency of the slower signal correlates with the frequency of the kilohertz qpo , assumed to be fixed by the keplerian frequency at the inner edge of the disk .",
    "we find a scaling index of @xmath20 , remarkably close to the predicted value of 2 .",
    "the only free parameter in the model is the ratio @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the moment of inertia in units of @xmath23  g  @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the mass of the neutron star in units of the solar mass .",
    "we find a value for @xmath21 of 3 to 4 .",
    "this is large for proposed equations of state .",
    "alternatively , the low frequency signal may be one of the oscillation modes in a boundary layer in the inner disk suggested by titarchuk , lapidus & muslimov ( 1998 ) .",
    "the modes in the vertical direction are responsible for the kilohertz qpos by comptonization of incoming photons .",
    "the low frequency signals are probably not connected to modes of rotational splitting . to get the proper scaling with the frequency of the kilohertz qpo , the ` s ' parameter ( titarchuk , lapidus & muslimov 1998 ) would have to change by a factor of about 5 .",
    "the low frequency oscillation , however , may correspond to modes in the radial direction .",
    "the predicted scaling is similar to the one reported here ( titarchuk 1998 ) .",
    "the correlation of break frequency and kilohertz qpo frequency may be the result of a mutual dependence on another parameter .",
    "the obvious candidate is the mass accretion rate .",
    "models explaining the kilohertz qpos predict , for different reasons , that the qpo frequency increases with mass accretion rate ( miller , lamb & psaltis 1998 , titarchuk , lapidus & muslimov 1998 ) .",
    "it is a reasonable conjecture that the break frequency is also correlated with the mass accretion rate , as the power spectra are very similar to the black hole candidates where indeed the break frequency is believed to increase with accretion rate ( van der klis 1994a , b ) . this similarity is underlined by the fact that relation between rms level of the power law and break frequency in 4u  172834 fits on the relation established for black holes ( mendez & van der klis 1997 , belloni & hasinger 1990 ) .",
    "the question remains as to what causes the low frequency noise and what determines the frequency of the break .",
    "the noise at low frequency may result from a superposition of shots ( e.g. belloni & hasinger 1990 ) with the break corresponding to the shots with the longest durations .",
    "the time scale of the shots may be set by the lifetime of clumps ( van der klis 1994b ) .",
    "the clumps could be destroyed by shearing in the inner disk .",
    "the decreasing shearing timescale at smaller radii ( pringle 1981 ) could account for the correlation of the break frequency , mass accretion rate and kilohertz qpo frequency if the inner disk radius decreases when the mass accretion rate increases .",
    "alternatively the lifetime of a shot may be determined by a diffusion time scale in the boundary layer described in titarchuk , lapidus & muslimov ( 1998 ) .",
    "the predicted correlation of the frequencies is similar to the one measured ( titarchuk 1998 ) .",
