    "single - electron tunneling @xcite in systems of small - capacitance tunnel junctions has attracted much attention during the last decade because of both the interesting physics and the possibility of useful devices .",
    "today the basic physics of single - electron tunneling is sufficiently well understood , and its possible applications ( for reviews see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) are becoming an important issue .",
    "the practical value of several analog applications has already been proven : for example , the single - electron transistor @xcite as a highly sensitive electrometer,@xcite the single - electron pump @xcite as a standard of dc current , @xcite and the array of tunnel junctions @xcite as an absolute thermometer.@xcite    in the field of digital electronics , however , only rudimentary devices have been demonstrated so far .",
    "@xcite the recent invention @xcite of hybrid circuits based on single - electron - transistor readout from floating - gate memory cells presumably opens a way to room - temperature _ memories _ with density beyond @xmath0 bit/@xmath1 .",
    "( this concept has been supported by recent experiments @xcite with the first low - temperature prototypes of such memory cells ) .",
    "the potential of single - electronics in _ logic _ circuits , however , remains uncertain due to substantial problems which have to be solved for both types of single - electron logic devices suggested so far .",
    "devices of the first type use single - electron transistors instead of field effect transistors in `` voltage - state '' circuits similar to conventional digital electronics .",
    "@xcite in these devices the effects of charge quantization are restricted to the interior of the single - electron transistors . as a result",
    ", the design of such circuits ( including complementary @xcite ) is relatively straightforward .",
    "they suffer , however , from a relatively high static power consumption .",
    "@xcite    the second possible way ( which allows to reduce the power dissipation ) , is to code bits directly by single electrons everywhere in the circuit .",
    "( a different , interesting approach based on rf parametric excitation of single - electron - tunneling oscillations has been suggested by kiel and oshima ; @xcite unfortunately their original proposal seems to have run into considerable implementation problems @xcite ) .",
    "it is important that these `` charge - state '' logic circuits do not necessarily require long wires and can be implemented using only small conducting islands separated by tunnel barriers , with the necessary power and timing provided by an external rf electric field .",
    "@xcite recently we suggested @xcite a new device for charge - state , wireless logic circuits - the single electron tunneling parametron ( or set parametron ) . in comparison with the wireless single - electron devices suggested earlier,@xcite",
    "the set parametron may have wider parameter margins and extremely low power dissipation , lower than the thermodynamic `` limit '' of @xmath2 per bit .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we present the results of a detailed analysis of the set parametron and basic logic circuits using this device .",
    "the major characteristics of the set parametron , including its parameter margins , speed , error rate , and power consumption , will be discussed .",
    "the basic cell of the new logic family , the set parametron , consists of three conducting islands - see fig .",
    "[ three - isl]a .",
    "( in our numerical calculations we have assumed the islands to be of spherical shape , with @xmath3 being the radius of the edge islands 1 and 3 , and @xmath4 the radius of the middle island 2 ; this assumption is , however , not important for the device operation . )",
    "the middle island is slightly shifted off the line passing through the centers of the edge islands .",
    "we will identify this line with @xmath5-axis , and the direction of the middle island shift with @xmath6-axis ( which is the symmetry axis of the cell ) .",
    "electrons can tunnel through small gaps between the middle and edge islands , but not directly between the edge islands because of their much larger spacing ( fig .",
    "[ three - isl]a ) .",
    "let us assume that the cell as a whole is charged by one uncompensated electron .",
    "( this assumption makes the explanation of the operation principle simpler ; later we will consider the more natural case of an initially neutral cell . )",
    "if the cell is biased with a sufficiently strong `` clock '' electric field @xmath7 directed along axis @xmath6 , the electron is obviously located at the central island.@xcite now let the field be decreased gradually so that eventually it changes direction to negative . at some moment the electron will have to tunnel to one of the edge islands because these states become energetically preferable . because of the geometrical symmetry , the choice of island ( left or right ) will be random , i.e. the charge symmetry of the system will be broken spontaneously .",
    "however , if there is a weak `` signal '' field @xmath8 along direction @xmath5 ( this field may be applied , for example , by the neighboring similar cell ) , the final position of the electron will depend on the sign of @xmath8 .",
    "a natural way to discuss this effect is to say that the signal field @xmath8 creates an energy difference @xmath9 between the electron states in islands 1 and 3 , and that the electron prefers to tunnel into the island with the lowest energy state ( fig .",
    "[ three - isl]b ) .",
    "if now the clock field @xmath10 becomes negative and large , it creates a high energy barrier @xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "[ three - isl]b ) between the edge islands , so that the electron is reliably trapped in the island it has tunneled to , regardless of further changes of the signal field @xmath8 .",
    "thus if fluctuations in the system are low enough , and the clock field changes slowly enough , even a small field @xmath8 of the proper sign at the decision - making moment ( when @xmath12=0 ) is sufficient to ensure a certain robust final polarization of the cell .",
    "this process can be interpreted as a reliable recording of one bit of information ; for example , the electron on the right island may mean logical `` 1 '' while the electron on the left island encode logical `` 0 '' .",
    "now the dipole moment of the cell can in turn be used to produce the signal field to control the other cells during their decision - making moments , and hence determine their information contents ( see section v below ) .",
    "this `` parametric '' amplification of signal , which gave the set parametron its name , is quite similar to the operation of a josephson junction device called parametric quantron @xcite ( re - invented later as the `` flux quantum parametron '' @xcite ) , and in a broader sense to rf - driven parametrons .",
    "@xcite the main difference is that all the previously analyzed parametrons are described by a continuous degree of freedom ( e.g. , the josephson phase @xmath13 in the parametric quantron ) .",
    "this variable can take any value , and the discrete information states correspond to energy minima on the @xmath13 axis .",
    "on the other hand , in the set parametron with low tunnel conductances , the possible states are discrete ( the electron has to be definitely on one of the islands at each particular instant ) .",
    "let us consider the operation of one set parametron cell using the orthodox theory @xcite which is adequate for the description of single - electron tunneling in systems with many background electrons in each island and sufficiently low conductance @xmath14 of tunnel junctions ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "in this theory the electron is always localized in one of the islands , and the rate @xmath16 of each tunneling event is solely determined by the corresponding decrease @xmath17 of electrostatic energy @xmath18 of the system . using elementary electrostatics ,",
    "we obtain the following expressions for the energy decreases corresponding to four possible tunneling events in the set parametron ( tunneling to / from each of the edge islands is denoted with signs @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively ) :    @xmath21    @xmath22    @xmath23 \\ , , \\ ] ]    @xmath24    here @xmath25(@xmath4 ) means left ( right ) junction , @xmath26 is the electrostatic potential of @xmath27-th island ( for numbering , see fig .",
    "[ three - isl]a ) , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the coulomb blockade energies , and @xmath30 is the inverse capacitance matrix .",
    "vectors @xmath31 are the dipole moments of islands when charged with single electrons , @xmath32 is the external electric field ( accepted to be uniform ) and @xmath33 is the total electric charge of @xmath27-th island , while @xmath34 is the uncompensated part of its background charge .    in the limit when the island radii are smaller than the spacing between islands , the following simple approximation for the capacitance matrix elements can be used : @xmath35 ^{1/2};\\,\\ ,   \\nonumber \\\\ & & { \\vec{d}}_{i}={\\vec{r}}_{i } ,   \\label{approx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the @xmath27-th island center , and @xmath37 is the dielectric constant of the dielectric environment . in the case of comparable radii and island spacing",
    ", @xmath38 have to be calculated numerically , for example , using the method of multiple electrostatic images ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the results show that approximation ( [ approx ] ) gives accuracy better than 10% if the spacing between the islands is larger than the largest island s radius .    in our initial analysis ( until section vii )",
    "we will assume that temperature @xmath39 is low and that the electric fields are changing slowly ( adiabatically ) .",
    "in this case the full result of the orthodox theory , @xmath40 }   \\label{gamma}\\ ] ] is reduced to the simple rule that the system always follows the local minimum of the total electrostatic energy .",
    "figure [ diag]a shows the phase diagram of stationary charge states of a cell charged by one uncompensated electron .",
    "each state is locally stable within a diamond - shape region corresponding to two conditions : @xmath41 being valid simultaneously , so that no tunneling event is possible , @xmath42 . within the small - island approximation ( [ approx ] )",
    "the position of the diamond center is @xmath43 ,    \\label{center } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the diamond width and height are @xmath44 ( here @xmath45 is the distance between island centers ",
    "see fig .",
    "[ three - isl]a ) .",
    "the diamonds are periodic along both axes @xmath8 and @xmath10 , with periods @xmath46 equations ( [ center])([period ] ) are valid even if the approximation ( [ approx ] ) is not used ; however , in this case @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 ( divided by @xmath51 ) need to be replaced by @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , respectively , and also @xmath56 and @xmath57 by @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( the corresponding equations are direct consequences of eqs .",
    "( [ gain])([wij ] ) and ( [ diamond ] ) ) .",
    "the period along axis @xmath8 corresponds to the transformation @xmath60 , while the period along @xmath10 axis corresponds to @xmath61 . notice that these transformations allow only even - number changes at the middle island ; the `` odd '' set of diamonds can be obtained from the `` even '' set by the shift @xmath62 .",
    "figure [ diag]a shows the results of more exact , numerical calculations of the phase diagram for a particular cell ; however , they are quite close to the approximate analytical results ( [ center])([period ] ) .",
    "( the approximation accuracy is better than 10% and it becomes even better than 1% after the normalization by @xmath63 and @xmath64 . ) for example , the minor offset of the diamond corners from the horizontal axis , which arises due to deviations from the analytical approximation , is hardly visible .",
    "the most important qualitative feature of the phase diagram is the existence of bistability regions ( shaded in fig .",
    "[ diag]a ) where either of two charge states is locally stable .",
    "we will refer to the set parametron in these regions as being in an on state , while the remaining part of the phase diagram corresponds to one of the possible off states of the system .",
    "if signal field @xmath8 is low ( as we suppose in the following ) , only the set of diamonds along axis @xmath10 may be implemented .",
    "the arrow in fig .",
    "[ diag]a shows a possible way ( described qualitatively in sec .",
    "ii above ) of switching the cell from a monostable off state to a bistable on state by changing the clock field @xmath10 .",
    "it is clear that the sign of a small @xmath65 field determines which diamond boundary will be crossed first , and hence determines the charge state of the system within this bistable region .",
    "notice that crossing any phase boundary outside of the bistable regions involves one tunneling event with negligible energy difference @xmath11 . in the adiabatic limit",
    "this transition is reversible , and the associated energy loss is infinitesimal ( see sec .",
    "however , leaving the bistable state from the state with higher energy results in two sequential tunneling events and leads to a finite energy loss .",
    "this irreversible switching should be avoided in reversible computation .",
    "below we will show that set parametron circuits can operate using exclusively reversible transitions .",
    "while the case of the cell charged by one electron is the simplest for understanding the device operation , a more natural option is the initially electrically neutral cell : @xmath66 .",
    "( this variety of set parametrons may be called the `` single exciton parametron '' , since digital bits in it are presented by electrostatically bound electron - hole pairs , although the physics of this bound state is rather different from that of the usual excitons in semiconductors . )",
    "figure [ diag]b shows the phase diagram of such a cell with the same geometrical parameters as in fig .  [ diag]a .",
    "the only difference between the diagrams is a change in the charge states labeling and a fixed shift along @xmath10 axis , so that the diagram in fig .",
    "[ diag]b is symmetric about both axes .",
    "( actually , _ any _ change of the initial charge of the cell is equivalent to a fixed offset of the fields @xmath10 and @xmath8 ) .    due to its field sign symmetry ,",
    "the single exciton parametron allows two natural modes of operation .",
    "the first is illustrated by the arrowed rectangle in the center of the diagram ( instead of the thick line in fig .",
    "[ diag]a we have drawn the rectangle in fig .  [",
    "diag]b to emphasize that @xmath8 may shift during the operation ) .",
    "the periodic clock field @xmath67 causes two switchings off@xmath68on and two switchings on@xmath68off per period .",
    "another possible mode of operation is shown by the smaller rectangle centered at @xmath8=@xmath69 .",
    "it also provides two pairs of on / off switchings per period of the clock field @xmath67 , with the bistable state implemented at small fields . in our analysis",
    "we will concentrate on the former operation mode because it does not require the additional dc bias of the signal field , though the latter mode may allow wider parameter margins .",
    "figures [ diag]a and [ diag]b show the phase diagrams of set parametrons for a particular set of geometric parameters . changing the parameters may result not only in quantitative but also qualitative changes of the diagram .",
    "in particular , regions with three stable charge states appear if the ratio @xmath70 of the diamond width and period becomes larger than 2 ; if the ratio is larger than 3 , four states can coexist , and so on .",
    "geometrically the multi - stability requires a smaller middle island to increase the coulomb barrier for the electron transfer between the edge islands via the middle island . for the sake of simplicity we will limit ourselves to the bistable case .",
    "figure [ sr - idea ] shows the standard scheme of operation of a shift register using parametron - type binary cells.@xcite in this figure , each symbol represents a parametron cell at some particular phase of the periodic switching process .",
    "dash means the monostable ( off ) state , while * i*@xmath71 means the @xmath27-th data bit which can be either `` 0 '' or `` 1 '' .",
    "evolution of the symbols shows the bit flow when the cells are periodically switched on and off using periodic clock signals which are shifted by @xmath72 for each next stage of the register .    in the initial state ( upper line ) each bit",
    "is encoded by the corresponding on state of only one parametron . the signal field created by this cell",
    "is exerted on both neighboring cells , initially in their off state . due to this field , when the right neighboring cell is switched from off to on by the clock field ( second line in fig .",
    "[ sr - idea ] ) , its logic state will be determined by that of the initial cell .",
    "now when the information has been copied to the right cell , the initial cell can be switched off ( third line of fig .",
    "[ sr - idea ] ) .",
    "thus , the information has been moved by one cell ( one register stage ) , and the process may be repeated again ( lines 4 to 7 ) and again . notice that unidirectionality of the bit propagation is achieved by the `` running wave '' of the clock while the structure itself is 1d - isotropic .    during each period of the three - phase clock ,",
    "the information is shifted by three stages , so that we need 3 cells per bit of information .",
    "it is straightforward to increase the number of phases beyond 3 .",

    "this rotation provides the shift of @xmath10 ( which is now the component of the clock field in the plane of the corresponding cell ) by 1/6 of the clock period for each next cell .",
    "when a cell is in on state , its dipole electric moment creates the signal field @xmath8 which is especially strong for its nearest neighbors , and thus determines the direction of electron tunneling when one of the neighbors in turned on .",

    "for correct operation of the shift register , switching off@xmath68on of a cell ( see , e.g. , point @xmath77 at the thicker middle curve ) should occur when the previous neighboring cell is in on state while the next neighboring cell is in off state , just as shown in fig .",

    "the above single - cell analysis is only an approximation , because in the real structure all the cells interact with each other and also the presence of neighboring cells somewhat changes the cell electrostatics .",
    "this is why we have carried out extensive numerical simulations of reasonably long shift registers ( 18 three - island cells ) . for a given geometry of the circuit we first calculated numerically the inverse capacitance matrix @xmath90 and the vectors @xmath91 ( see appendix a )",
    "; then these numbers were fed to a monte - carlo program which simulated single - electron tunneling events in the circuit using the `` orthodox '' theory.@xcite the logical input was a relatively long ( typically , 16-bit ) quasi - random bit sequence , repeated periodically many times .",

    "[ set - sr ] , elliptic polarization of the clock field ( rather than the simple circular polarization implied above ) is essential to provide broad margins .",

    "these margins are much broader than those for the first generation of wireless single - electron devices . @xcite    the margins for parameters which destroy the geometric symmetry of the parametron cells are much narrower .",
    "numerical simulations show that for a shift register with the parameters quoted above , the maximum allowable shift of the edge islands of a cell in the opposite directions ( parallel to the central island shift ) is about @xmath108 .",

    "one more possible source of errors is the higher - order quantum process of cotunneling @xcite when two or more electrons tunnel simultaneously through different junctions . for illustration , the lowest energy diagram in fig .",
    "[ three - isl]b shows the situation when the charge state with higher energy is occupied , and the digital information in the cell is preserved by the energy barrier ( higher energy of the symmetric state ) due to the bias field . according to the orthodox theory , single - electron tunneling in this case is impossible ( at sufficiently low temperature ) .",
    "however , the second - order cotunneling , i.e. simultaneous tunneling of two electrons ( through both junction ) brings the system into the lower energy state and , hence , is energetically allowed .",
    "this process changes the sign of the cell dipole moment and can lead to the digital error .",
    "this type of error can occur , for example , in the 3-phase shift register during the phase when the bit is stored by only one cell , and the long - range interaction with cells carrying other bits ( nearest cells are off ) provides uncontrolled sign of the energy difference between `` @xmath25 '' and `` @xmath4 '' states .",
    "the erroneous bit will then propagate along the shift register .    though a detailed analysis of cotunneling was not a goal of this work",
    ", we should notice that several means are readily available to reduce the resulting error probability .",
    "first , because the rate of @xmath133-electron cotunneling scales as @xmath225 ( where @xmath226 @xmath227 @xmath228 is the quantum unit of resistance ) while the single - electron rate is proportional to the first power of @xmath14 , the decrease of @xmath14 decreases the relative importance of the cotunneling processes .",
    "another , more powerful method is to increase the smallest order @xmath133 of possible cotunneling processes .",
    "this can be done , for example , by increasing the number of islands per cell .",
    "if the cell consists of 5 islands and the on state corresponds to an electron on one of the outer islands , then at least the 4-th order cotunneling ( @xmath229 ) is necessary to switch between logical zero and unity ; a further increase of the number of islands per cell makes the cotunneling rate negligible even for relatively large tunnel conductance .",
    "finally , it is possible to increase the minimal cotunneling order while still using three - island cells , by increasing the number of cells which store the same bit .",
    "this can be done , for example , by the increase of the number of phases in the operation of the shift register . in the realization shown in fig .",
    "[ set - sr ] this may easily be achieved by a decrease of the angle @xmath80 between the planes of neighboring cells .",
    "if the bit is stored by @xmath230 neighboring cells then the error can occur only if all these @xmath231 cells will simultaneously change their polarizations and if the final state has a lower energy ( any `` partial '' switching would cost at least one cell - cell interaction energy and , hence , is thermodynamically forbidden at least for not too large @xmath230 ) .",
    "so , the lowest order of erroneous cotunneling is @xmath232 , and the linear increase in `` hardware '' allows the exponential reduction of the error probability .",
    "this method is applicable to any logic gates which use shift registers as their input and output lines .",
    "in this paper we have presented a functionally complete logic family based on the set parametron cells , including inverter , fan - out - two , nand and nor gates .",
    "all the circuits may operate correctly in a common range for the bias field amplitude .",
    "the important advantages of the set parametron logic are wireless operation and extremely low power dissipation possible in the quasi - reversible mode of operation , with the energy loss much less then @xmath2 per bit .    while the realization of room temperature operation of the set parametron logic requires sub - one - nanometer fabrication technology which is hardly available at the present time , the operation of simple set parametron circuits ( with clock wires ) can be readily demonstrated experimentally at lower temperatures .",
    "an obvious choice is the aluminum shadow - mask evaporation technology , widely accepted for singe - electron device fabrication ( see , e.g. , the collection @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ alumin ] shows the sketch of a possible layout of the two - cell set parametron shift register - inverter .",
    "( for the sake of simplicity , the artifact islands typical for this technology are not shown ) .",
    "each cell consists of three islands .",
    "the capacitive gates are used for the application of rf `` clock '' fields which cause the switching processes , and simultaneously for the application of dc fields to compensate random background charges .",
    "input gates a and b ( for the initial demonstration , one gate is sufficient ) determine the polarization of the first cell during its off@xmath68on switching .",
    "this polarization in turn determines the polarization of the next cell during its off@xmath68on switching .",
    "the final polarization of the latter cell is sensed by a capacitively coupled single - electron transistor .",
    "( if a multilayer fabrication is available , this layout may be further improved to provide wider parameter margins : an overlap ( without tunneling ) of the edge islands of two cells would increase their capacitive coupling , while a similar overlap of the bias gates with the islands would allow smaller cross - talk . )",
    "the operation temperature of such a set - parametron circuit with 100-nm - scale tunnel junctions will be in sub-1-k range .",
    "coming back to the wireless realization , let us estimate the parameters of a possible implementation of the device using the conducting ( e.g. , metallic ) clusters as islands .",
    "for a cluster diameter @xmath116 about 5 nm ( which is at the limit of present - day direct e - beam writing techniques ) the charging energy @xmath233 is about @xmath234 ( where @xmath235 is taken as a typical dielectric constant for the organic materials which are the natural candidates for the cluster environment ) .",

    "( [ therm - err ] ) yields the maximal operation temperature of about 15 k. assuming the same value for the dynamic error ( then @xmath239  see eq .",
    "( [ dyn ] ) ) and taking into account the particular geometry ( fig .",
    "[ set - sr ] ) , we obtain the maximum clock frequency @xmath240 that corresponds to about @xmath241 hz for our parameters and @xmath242(10@xmath243 ohm)@xmath244 ( higher @xmath14 would make the cotunneling a problem ) . in this case the power dissipation ( see eq .",
    "( [ highspeed ] ) ) is about @xmath245 w per cell .",
    "this extremely low dissipation would make possible an integration level up to 10@xmath246 cells per @xmath1 ( i.e.  10@xmath247 nm@xmath248 per cell ) , limited by the cell size , since at 15 k the heat flux about 1w/@xmath1 can be easily managed without the circuit overheating . to achieve the quasi - reversible mode of operation the frequency should be even lower : @xmath249 hz for our set of parameters at @xmath250 k. accepting , for example , @xmath251",
    "hz we get a power dissipation of only about @xmath252 w per cell .",
    "this figure indicates that as far as power dissipation is concerned , three - dimensional integration of set parametron circuits is quite feasible . despite the not very spectacular clock frequency in this regime , the total computing performance of a 3d system can be very large .",
    "the largest problem with set parametron circuits ( besides their fabrication ) is that their operation requires well - defined background charges .",
    "the allowed fluctuations are only on the order of @xmath253 ( this number corresponds to the maximum tolerated angle of the cell tilt ",
    "see section v ) . this is a common problem for any single - electron logic ( see for example refs .",
    "however , if / when a molecular technology becomes available for the implementation of single - electron and other nanoscale devices , set parametron cells may be reproducible on the molecular level , and well defined background charges seem to be achievable in principle .    from the estimates above we see that in order to increase the operation temperature of set parametron circuits up to 300 k or even up to 77 k , sub  nanometer - scale islands are necessary .",
    "in this case the energy level discreteness @xcite may result in radically new features of the set parametron operation , and should be taken into account at its quantitative analysis .",
    "such analysis is outside the scope of the present paper .",

    "let us use this method to calculate the inverse capacitance matrix of two spheres with radii @xmath4 and @xmath260 with distance @xmath57 between the centers . for that , we need to calculate the electrostatic potential when a charge @xmath255 is placed on the sphere @xmath3 .",

    "the same method is trivially generalized to an arbitrary number of spheres : we need to make images of all charges in all spheres .",
    "the method is very simple mathematically but can not be applied in a straightforward way if the number @xmath264 of spheres is large , because the number of required image pairs scales as @xmath265 where @xmath266 is the number of iterations .",
    "if @xmath267 and @xmath268 ( that is a typical number of necessary iterations if the spheres are close to each other , and we require a good accuracy ) , then the computer memory will obviously be insufficient .    to solve this problem we use three ways ( levels ) of storage of information about the pairs , depending on their magnitude ( the pair magnitude can be characterized by two numbers : the distance between the charges and the dipole moment of the pair ) . for `` large '' pairs we store the whole information ( position and the charge magnitude ) . when the image of a sufficiently `` small '' pair is calculated , we store only the location and the magnitude ( dipole moment ) of the dipole consisting of two image charges , and the total charge at the sphere center .",
