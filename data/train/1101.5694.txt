    "while bardeen - cooper - schiffer ( bcs ) superconductivity / superfluidity  @xcite in fermi systems was investigted more than 50 years ago , the main scientific interest in recent experiments of two - component ultracold fermi gas is to create a new type of fermi superfluid in the bcs  bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) crossover  @xcite . at the feshbach resonance where the s - wave scattering length @xmath12 diverges",
    ", a novel type of fermi superfluid has been observed  @xcite . in the dilute gas limit , where the finite - range effect of the interaction can be neglected ,",
    "the only length scale in the many - body problem is the inter - particle distance . in this so - called unitary fermi gas",
    ", any physical quantity can be expressed in terms of its value in the non - interacting case multiplied by a universal constant  @xcite .",
    "for example , the energy density can be written as @xmath13 , where @xmath6 is a universal constant and @xmath14 the energy density of the non - interacting fermi gas .",
    "a possible realization of such a unitary fermi superfluid is the dilute neutron matter  @xcite which exists in neutron star crust , since the neutron - neutron scattering length @xmath15fm is much larger than the effective range of the nuclear force and the inter - particle distance .",
    "in addition to the idealized case where fermion pairing occurs on a uniform fermi surface , the effect of pure zeeman energy splitting @xmath16 ( here @xmath17 with the effective  magnetic field \" @xmath18 and the magnetic moment @xmath19 ) between spin - up and -down electrons in the bcs superconductivity was known many years ago  @xcite . at a critical zeeman field or the so - called chandrasekhar - clogston ( cc ) limit @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the zero temperature gap , a first order phase transition from the gapped bcs state to the normal state occurs .",
    "further theoretical studies showed that the inhomogeneous fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state  @xcite may survive in a narrow window between @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "however , since the thermodynamic critical field is much smaller than the cc limit due to strong orbit effect @xcite , it is hard to observe the cc limit and the fflo state in ordinary superconductors .",
    "recent experiments for strongly interacting ultracold fermi gases give an alternative way to study the pure zeeman effect on fermi superfluidity  @xcite .",
    "the atom numbers of the two lowest hyperfine states of @xmath24li , denoted by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , are adjusted to create a population imbalance , which simulates effectively the zeeman field @xmath27 in a superconductor . at the unitary point ,",
    "phase separation phenomenon between the unpolarized superfluid and the polarized normal gas , predicted by early theoretical works  @xcite and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations  @xcite , has been observed  @xcite .",
