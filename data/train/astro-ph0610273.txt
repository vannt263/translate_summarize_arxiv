    "it is generally presumed that life on earth developed from an initial reservoir of simpler prebiotic organic material such as amino acids , fatty acids and sugars .",
    "what is not clear is whether the chemical evolution to produce this initial reservoir occurred on the early earth , in the pre - solar nebula , or even earlier in interstellar molecular clouds .",
    "in fact , a significant body of work exists which suggests that the necessary chemical evolution could not have taken place on the early earth itself ( joyce et al .",
    "1984 ; bailey et al 1998 ) , suggesting that the chemical evolution took place within the pre - solar nebula , with the organic material being delivered to the earth by meteorites and comets during the phase of bombardment .",
    "although there is expected to be some chemical and physical processing of material originating in the ism , through the pre - solar nebula , into cometary and meteoritic material , and on to the surface of a planet , a study of the most complex molecules in the ism is an important step in determining how likely it is that the reservoir of molecules from which life evolved originated in the pre - solar nebula .",
    "indeed , a large number of surprisingly complex molecules , including amino acids , have been found in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites ( see e.g. wirick et al .",
    "2006 ) , which are thought to be relatively unprocessed remnants of the presolar nebula .",
    "in this paper we describe an australia telescope compact array ( atca ) search for two biologically important molecules : the simplest amino acid glycine ( @xmath5 ) , and the cyclic molecule propylene oxide ( @xmath6 ) which is chiral .",
    "chiral molecules are those where asymmetry in carbon atom placement within a molecule leads to two distinct forms ( mirror images or enantiomers ) .",

    "miao et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and snyder ( 1997 ) reported a possible detection of a 90 ghz transition of glycine in sgr b2 ( n ) with bima and ovro ( interferometers ) .",
    "there were some caveats in snyder ( 1997 ) due to uncertainty in the glycine line rest frequency , the different velocity components in sgr b2 ( n ) , and the confusion with other lines .",
    "combes , rieu & wlodarczak ( 1996 ) used the iram 30-m telescope ( single dish ) for the positions orion sio and sgr b2 ( oh ) and concluded that the confusion of lines in the millimetre spectra , particularly in the orion position , could make the detection of glycine impossible , as the glycine lines would be below the confusion limit .",
    "kuan et al.(2003 , 2004a , 2004b ) have reported the detection of glycine in sgr b2 ( n - lmh ) , orion kl and w51 e1/e2 using the nrao 12-m telescope .",
    "they used the detailed comparison of lines in the different sources to help solve the problem of `` interloper '' lines of other species . the use of rotation diagrams to provide a quantitative comparision of many detections and upper limits of the glycine lines for all three sources gives greater confidence in the results .",

    "( 1998 ) to show that upper limits from non - detections of glycine lines quite stringently rule out glycine in the three sources at the level reported by kuan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) unless present as the higher energy conformer ii .",
    "in addition , they argue how random coincidences of lines misidentified as glycine could lead to a plausible looking , but spurious , fit to lines in a rotation diagram .",
    "investigations of primitive mechanisms of self - replication that involve rna only , indicate the need for a reservoir of homochiral ( having like chirality ) organic molecules on the early earth , before living organisms could evolve ( joyce et al .",
    "an excess of about 10 % in one enantiomer over the other ( l over d in the case of amino acids on the earth ) is needed for rna template reproduction to work .",
    "non - biological processes always create chiral organic molecules in a racemic mix ( equal numbers of both handednesses ) and there are no known abiotic mechanisms operating on the surface of the earth to generate the required enantiomeric excess .",
    "therefore , an extraterrestrial origin for the prebiotic molecules needed to seed life on earth is likely if we accept the hypothesis that primitive reproduction involved only rna .    an extraterrestrial mechanism for producing the requisite homochirality is necessary .",
    "the most likely mechanism is circularly polarized uv radiation in the ism , which is known to be capable of generating an enantiomeric excess by selectively destroying one enantiomer over the other ( bailey et al 1998 ) .",
    "regrettably radio astronomy can not distinguish the mirror image molecular forms , which in different concentrations would signal chiral imbalance , but it can potentially detect the presence of molecules capable of this property . to date , no molecules possessing a chiral centre have been detected in the ism .",
    "glycine is not a chiral molecule , and our search for biologically important chiral molecules with the atca and mopra is focusing on propylene oxide .",
    "the simpler , non - chiral , but chemically related cyclic species ethylene oxide ( @xmath10 ) has already been detected in sgr b2n ( dickens et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "two developments prompted this search for glycine and propylene oxide :    * firstly , we have been able to use laboratory measured values of the rest frequencies of glycine and propylene oxide transitions between 85 and 115 ghz rather than the less accurate calculated values ( lovas et al .",
    "1995 ) on which previous searched at 3 mm have had to rely .",
    "the measurements were made at the school of chemistry , monash university , using a purpose - built stark - modulated free - jet microwave absorption spectrometer of a design similar to that described previously ( brown et al .",
    "these measured values have an uncertainty of around only 0.07 km / s in the central velocity of a transition . * secondly , the new capabilities of the atca at millimetre wavelengths allows a search at high spatial resolution , minimising beam dilution effects and , as an interferometer , filtering out confusing lines from the extended gas within the beam .",
    "our search has a multi - pronged approach , involving both single dish and interferometer observations of multiple frequencies within the 3-mm band .",
    "the position sgr b2 ( lmh ) is of small diameter ( @xmath115 arcseconds ) and has so far provided detections of the related complex molecules methyl formate and acetic acid ( which is a precursor to glycine in some reaction networks ) .",
    "these molecules seem to be confined to the lmh .",
    "however , another similar molecule , glycolaldehyde ( hollis et al . 2001 ) , was found to be extended in the sgr b2 ( n ) molecular cloud , with very low concentrations in the lmh .",
    "these three molecules are believed to have a common origin with glycine ( sorrell 2001 ) based on a model of chemical reactions in icy grain mantles .",
    "it is therefore important to search for glycine in both extended and compact dense molecular gas .",
    "we are thus using both the atca and the single dish mopra radio telescope .",
    "the mopra telescope , jointly operated by the atnf csiro , and the university of new south wales , australia , has a 22-m diameter , making it the largest single dish telescope operating at 3-mm in the southern hemisphere .",
    "mopra results will be discussed in a subsequent paper .    in the laboratory",
    ", glycine can adopt more than one conformation or spatial arrangement of the groups . since it is uncertain which conformer of glycine may be present in the ism , we searched for lines from both conformer i and conformer ii ( lovas et al . 1995 )",
    ". conformer i has lower energy than ii by around @xmath12  @xmath13 ( lovas et al .",
    "1995 ) , but conformer ii has a larger dipole moment and hence stronger lines .",
    "there is a significant energy barrier between conformers i and ii , since to go from one to the other requires breaking a hydrogen bond rather than just an internal rotation .",
    "the energy barrier is estimated theoretically at around @xmath14  @xmath13 or @xmath15 ( godfrey , brown & rodgers 1996 ) . at interstellar temperatures",
    "the rate of tunnelling through the barrier will be low .",
    "if glycine is formed at low temperatures on grain surfaces , it may be stuck in the original conformation , and if the formation chemical processes favoured conformer ii , it would relax only very slowly into the lower energy conformer i. thus it is worthwhile searching for both conformers .",
    "observations were made with the australia telescope compact array , in 2002 and 2003 , during the southern winter period of conditions appropriate for 3-mm observations .",
    "the log of observations is given in table 1 .",
    ".log of atca observations , frequency bands and lines searched .",
    "the frequencies quoted are from new laboratory measurements made at the school of chemistry , monash university .",
    "the corresponding transitions are listed in table 4 .",
    "the asterisk in column 4 denotes the line used as rest frequency for the velocity scale when more than one line was in the observed band .",
    "i d specifies the molecule , propylene oxide ( po ) or glycine ( g ) , and conformer , i or ii ( glycine only ) , with this transition frequency .",
    "strength is a measure of the intensity predicted at 10 k and 50 k ( 10 k if only one number is given ) , relative to a value of 100 for the strongest line of that species in the 80 - 115 ghz range .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab5 ]      due to the large number of strong transitions of ethyl cyanide ( ch@xmath16ch@xmath17cn ) and methanol ( ch@xmath16oh ) in the 3-mm band , we have measured serendipitously 4 transitions of each molecule .",
    "these two molecules are found in the small scale structure near continuum source n , at around 64 km / s , and also found at the other component at 73 km / s 5 arcsec to the north . to calculate the brightness temperature and column density ,",
    "we assume a size @xmath18 arcsec , based on the median spatial size of line emission in our datacubes .",
    "the upper level column densities are given in table 5 , along with some of the molecular parameters used .",
    "given the detection of several transitions at different upper energy levels , we can fit rotation diagrams to derive the excitation temperature and total column density .",
    "the fits give @xmath19  k and @xmath20  @xmath2 for ch@xmath16ch@xmath17cn in the main 64 km / s cloud , @xmath21  k and @xmath22  @xmath2 for ch@xmath16oh in the 64 km / s cloud and @xmath23  k and @xmath24  @xmath2 for ch@xmath16oh in the 73 km / s cloud .",
    "these excitation temperatures are in good agreement with that expected for sgr b2 lmh , eg .",
    "170 k for ch@xmath16oh from pei , liu & snyder ( 2000 ) .",
    "the estimates of column density are dependent on the assumed source size , but our estimate of total column density for ch@xmath16ch@xmath17cn in sgr b2 lmh is about a factor of two higher than that obtained by miao & snyder ( 1997 ) , liu & snyder ( 1999 ) and liu , mehringer & snyder ( 2001 ) when corrected for the different assumed sizes .",
    "similarly , our estimate of column density for ch@xmath16oh is in good agreement ( 30 % higher ) with that of pei et al .",
    "( 2000 ) when corrected for source size .",
    "we have used the atca during 2002 and 2003 to conduct a search for the simplest amino acid , glycine , and the simple chiral molecule propylene oxide , at 3-mm , using the three millimetre capable antennas available at that time .",
    "we searched 15 portions of spectrum between 85 and 91 ghz , each of 64 mhz bandwidth .",
    "the main results are as follows :    * we have detected 58 emission features and 21 absorption features in the 15 portions of spectrum searched .",
    "this gives a line density of 75 emission and 25 absorption lines per ghz stronger than the 5@xmath0 level of 110 mjy .",
    "* we have tentatively assigned 23 of the detected spectral lines to transitions listed in the jpl on - line database ( table 3 ) but as many of these involve molecules not previously detected in the ism , these assignments can not be regarded with confidence .",
    "* we did not confidently detect either glycine or propylene oxide , but can set 3@xmath0 upper limits for most transitions searched . * assuming that the glycine emission is extended with respect to the atca synthesised beam size of 17.0 x 3.4 arcsec@xmath3 , our 3@xmath0 upper limit of @xmath25 @xmath2 is consistent with that of @xmath1 @xmath2 of kuan et al .",
