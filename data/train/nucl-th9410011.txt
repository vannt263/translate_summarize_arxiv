    "the available models , except for bonn models@xcite , use only the leading term , independent of @xmath43 , of the @xmath191 ( eq .",
    "thus the @xmath203 in these models compensates for the neglected @xmath198 term of @xmath204 .",
    "however , this compensation can not be exact since the @xmath198 term in @xmath204 generates a momentum - dependent tensor force . such a force is not yet included in other models of @xmath201 . attempts to refit the @xmath205 scattering data with the @xmath191 correct up to order @xmath55 are in progress .",
    "these will presumably provide better empirical models of @xmath203 , and also be useful to study relativistic effects of order @xmath55 .",
    "unique identification of relativistic effects is difficult in nuclear physics due to a lack of @xmath206 understanding of nuclear forces from qcd .",
    "several relativistic effects are inadvertently included in the non - relativistic hamiltonian ( 1.1 ) via the phenomenological interactions @xmath40 and @xmath182 obtained by fits to observed data .",
    "however non - relativistic hamiltonians do not contain several known relativistic effects .",
    "the relativistic hamiltonians given by eq .",
    "( 1.3 ) seem to offer a practical method to include these effects in nuclear many - body theory .",
    "it is technically possible to treat the kinetic energy of nucleons relativistically .",
    "the two - body problem can be easily solved in momentum space and realistic models of @xmath201 can be obtained by fitting the scattering data .",
    "faddeev  yakubovsky@xcite and the quantum monte carlo methods@xcite can be used with the relativistic kinetic energy operator @xmath19 .",
    "it is difficult to expand the square root beyond the non - relativistic term .",
    "the next term , @xmath207 , is attractive , and a hamiltonian unbounded from below results when @xmath208 and higher terms are neglected .",
    "in contrast it appears to be useful to expand the @xmath38 in powers of @xmath209 because the total momentum of an interacting pair of nucleons in nuclei is generally much less than @xmath43 .",
    "the lowest order @xmath38 is relatively simple ( eq .",
    "1.7 ) and seems to be dominated by the classical terms coming from the relativistic energy - momentum relation and lorentz contraction .    a relativistic many - body theory of nuclei can also be developed starting from quantum field theory .",
    "the relativistic hamiltonians and quantum field theory imply the same relation between @xmath35 and @xmath38 dictated by the invariance of the poincar group .",
    "the theory based on hadron fields also provides a theoretical framework to construct models of @xmath35 , @xmath182 and many - nucleon interactions@xcite .",
    "this framework is certainly useful , but limited by the relatively small number of fields , such as @xmath210 , @xmath211 , @xmath212 , @xmath152 , @xmath213 , @xmath214 , that can be treated .",
    "if the internal structure of nucleons strongly influences the @xmath35 then one would need to treat consistently a large number of hadron fields .",
    "in this case it may be advantageous to use relativistic hamiltonians containing semi - phenomenological models of @xmath35 and @xmath182 having field - theoretic long - range pion - exchange parts and shorter - range phenomenological parts .",
    "finally we note that in this approach it is rather simple to describe a nucleus moving with a velocity @xmath215 .",
    "its wave function is given by : @xmath216 where @xmath217 describes the nucleus with zero total momentum , @xmath218 and @xmath46 is given by equations ( 2.4 ) , ( 2.14 ) and ( 2.16 ) .",
    "up to order @xmath219 for a two - nucleon system at time @xmath220 we obtain : @xmath221\\cdot{\\bf v}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath26 and @xmath72 in the above equation are operators . using @xmath222",
    "we obtain : @xmath223\\left(1+\\frac{1}{4}|{\\bf v}|^2\\right)^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times\\ \\exp{\\left[i{\\bf r}\\cdot{\\bf v}\\left(2m+\\frac{p^2}{m}+\\tilde{v}+m|{\\bf v}|^2\\right)\\right]}\\ |\\psi_0\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the energy of the two - nucleon state is given by : @xmath224 we can identify @xmath225 as the value ( not operator ) of the total momentum .",
    "the factor @xmath226 in @xmath227 produces the lorentz contraction of the wave function and the @xmath228 term gives spin rotations .",
    "one of the @xmath229 factors compensates for the change in normalization due to the lorentz contraction , while the other represents the covariant normalization @xmath230 of the boosted wave function@xcite . due to the choice @xmath83 made in section ii , only kinematical changes occur in the boosted wave function .",
