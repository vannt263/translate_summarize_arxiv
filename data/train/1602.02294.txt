    "in the source broadcast problem , a source is sent over a broadcast channel through suitable encoding and decoding so that the reconstructions at the receivers satisfy the prescribed constraints . the special case of sending a gaussian source over a gaussian broadcast channel",
    "has received particular attention . for this special case , it is known that source - channel separation is in general suboptimal @xcite and hybrid digital - analog coding schemes can outperform pure digital / analog schemes @xcite .",
    "the extension of the hybrid coding architecture to the non - gaussian setting can be found in @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the progress on the converse side is still somewhat limited . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the first non - trivial result in this direction was obtained by reznic _",
    "@xcite for the scalar version of the aforementioned gaussian case .",
    "the converse argument in @xcite involves an auxiliary random variable , which is generated by the source via an additive gaussian noise channel .",
    "this auxiliary random variable is constructed in exactly the same manner as the one in ozarow s celebrated work on the gaussian multiple description problem @xcite . however",
    ", this resemblance is , in a certain sense , rather superficial .",
    "indeed , on a more technical level , the auxiliary random variable introduced by ozarow ( as elucidated in @xcite ) plays the role of exploiting an implicit conditional independence structure whereas the role of the auxiliary random variable in @xcite is apparently different and still largely elusive .",
    "recent years have seen several new converse results @xcite for the source broadcast problem .",
    "these results are based on arguments similar to the original one by reznic _",
    "et al . _ , especially in terms of the way the auxiliary random variables are constructed and exploited .",
    "it is worth noting that such arguments can only handle a restricted class of auxiliary random variables ( essentially those that can be generated by the source via certain additive noise channels ) ; this restriction typically leads to certain constraints on the set of sources , channels , or distortion measures that can be analyzed .",
    "the present paper is , to a certain extent , an outcome of our effort in seeking a conceptual understanding of the converse argument by reznic _",
    "_ in general and the role of the associated auxiliary random variable in particular",
    ". we shall show that one can establish a source - channel separation theorem for a variant of the source broadcast problem and leverage it to derive a necessary condition for the original problem .",
    "this necessary condition , when specialized to the case of sending a scalar gaussian source over a gaussian broadcast channel , recovers the corresponding result by reznic _",
    "_ @xcite ; moreover , in this way , the converse argument in @xcite finds a simple interpretation , and the associated auxiliary random variable acquires an operational meaning .",
    "it should be pointed out that , in our approach , the auxiliary random variable can be generated by the source in an arbitrary manner .",
    "therefore , the restriction imposed in the existing arguments @xcite is in fact unnecessary . on the other hand , the problem of identifying the optimal auxiliary random variable naturally arises due to this additional freedom .",
    "it will be seen that the analytical solutions for this problem can be found in some special cases ; interestingly , these solutions indicate that the specific choices of auxiliary random variables in @xcite are actually optimal in their respective contexts .",

    ", it is known that the achievable distortion region of a certain hybrid digital - analog coding scheme @xcite matches the outer bound in @xcite whereas separate source - channel coding is in general suboptimal @xcite .",
    "an alternative proof of the outer bound in @xcite was recently obtained by song _",
    "this new proof @xcite bears some similarity to the aforementioned converse argument by reznic _",
    "we will clarify their connection by giving a unified proof for the vector gaussian case , which implies , among other things , that the outer bound in @xcite can be deduced from the general necessary condition for the source broadcast problem found in the present paper .",
