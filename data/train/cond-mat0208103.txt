    "after an initial relaxation period of @xmath37 , statistics was gathered in the steady state .",
    "let us first recapitulate what is know for _ parallel _ external forces @xmath1 and @xmath3 : in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that lane formation occurs involving either @xmath0 or @xmath2 particles which are sliding against each other in the field direction . in the lane involving @xmath0 particles only , all these particle are drifting with an global velocity @xmath38 while opposite regions which involve @xmath2 particles are streaming with the overall velocity @xmath39 . by subtracting the overall velocity using a galilei transformation",
    "one readily sees that within the completely separated lanes , equilibrium boltzmann statistics is realized .",
    "the system just separates into two different equilibrium states which are drifting relative to each other .",
    "physically , the formation of lanes is generated by collisions of @xmath0 against @xmath2 particles pushed by the external force which dynamically separates @xmath0 and @xmath2 particles until completely demixed lanes are formed . a similar lane formation for sheared granular matter",
    "was found via molecular dynamics simulation in @xcite .",
    "the formation of lanes is a sharp first - order non - equilibrium phase transition occurring if the external field difference @xmath40 exceeds a critical value .",
    "a galilei transformation also proves that only the relative velocity of @xmath0 and @xmath2 regions is relevant .",
    "hence , without loss of generality , it is sufficient to study the special case @xmath4 .    for _ non - parallel _",
    "external forces , the collisions between @xmath0 and @xmath2 particles are not any longer central and the phase separated structure will be different , in general . in order to get insight into the location of an interface between two completely demixed regions involving @xmath0 and @xmath2 particles only , we first do a simple continuum argument : consider a ( one - dimensional ) interface between an @xmath0 and @xmath2 region with a direction described by a two - dimensional vector @xmath41 , see fig .",
    "the full interface position can be parameterized by a set of vectors    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is a real parameter and @xmath44 is a vector describing a point on the interface . after a time @xmath45 ,",
    "the @xmath0 particles have moved on average a distance @xmath46 , while the @xmath2 particles have been displaced by a distance @xmath47 . neglecting any collisions , the @xmath0 particles near the interface will move towards a new interface which is described by the set of vectors @xmath48 while the @xmath2 particles near the interface will drift to @xmath49 with another real parameter @xmath50 .",
    "the interface can only be stable if these two interfaces coincide . in case",
    "they do not , there is either empty space which will be filled by neighboring particles or @xmath0 and @xmath2 particles will collide which will destroy the interface as well .",
    "hence , the stability criterion is that for any @xmath43 there is an @xmath50 such that @xmath51 which simply yields the condition @xmath52 .",
    "\\label{interface4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this implies that for an interface to be stable , its direction has to be collinear with the force difference @xmath53 hence , the angle @xmath27 describing the interface orientation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) is @xmath54 clearly , contrarily to the case of parallel forces , the interface position will move in space .",
    "the interface velocity @xmath55 normal to its position can be calculated as @xmath56 obviously , the same argument can be repeated with exchanged roles of @xmath0 and @xmath2 showing that stable parallel lanes with the direction @xmath57 are expected with move with the interface velocity @xmath55 given by eq .",
    "( [ velocity ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the same argument applied for a small @xmath45 shows that _ a curved interface _ is unstable such that a stable interface has to be straight .",
    "let us finally discuss two special cases : first returning to parallel forces , indeed the interface direction is parallel to the field direction , the angle @xmath27 is @xmath58 , and the interface velocity vanishes as follows directly from eq .",
    "( [ velocity ] ) .",
    "second the case of perpendicular forces deserves some particular attention . here",
    "the angle @xmath27 is @xmath59 and the interface velocity can be expressed as @xmath60    obviously , this general argument is only a necessary condition for a stable @xmath61 interface .",
    "an alternative is a mixed situation with no interface at all driven by entropy . in analogy to the parallel case we anticipate that a critical strength of @xmath57 is needed to build stable lanes .",
    "this will now be investigated by computer simulation and simple theory in more detail .      in our simulation",
    "we assume - without loss of generality - the direction of @xmath3 along the @xmath62 axis of the simulation box .",
    "the model parameters are fixed to @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",

    "[ ss_2d](a ) , no field is applied and a homogeneous completely mixed state is visible . in fig . [ ss_2d](b ) , on the other hand , the external forces are parallel : @xmath66 .",
    "the magnitude @xmath67 is beyond the critical strength @xcite such that lane formation parallel to the field shows up .",
    "nonparallel forces with perpendicular directions are investigated in figs .",
    "[ ss_2d ] ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "one observes formation of tilted lanes which are indeed in the direction of the force difference vector as expected from our general argument . in following the configurations as a function of time we verified the simple formula of the interface velocity @xmath68 as given in eq .",
    "( [ velocity ] ) .    in a next step , we study perpendicular forces keeping their ratio @xmath69 fixed but increasing their magnitude . for small forces",
    "the system stays demixed . in increasing the strength of both fields ,",
    "we have calculated suitable order parameters which are sensitive to tilted lane formation .",
    "these are immediate generalizations of those used in ref .",
    "the order parameter exhibits a sharp jump indicating the critical field strength of the force difference vector upon which tilted lane formation is achieved .",
    "there is a clear hysteresis loop if the force is reduced again such that the non - equilibrium phase transition towards tilted lane formation is of first order .",
    "the critical value @xmath70 of the force difference @xmath71 is shown versus the ratio @xmath69 in fig .",
    "[ phase ] .",
    "we shall compare these data to a simple theoretical prediction in the next subsection .",
    "a careful remark is in order for small positive @xmath72 .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions used in the simulation corresponds to a toroidal topology shown in fig .",
    "[ torus ] .",
    "if @xmath72 is getting small the boundary conditions enforce a multiple winding around the torus such that finite size effects are expected to be significant .",
    "therefore we have not shown simulation data for small @xmath72 in fig .",
    "[ ss_2d ] .",
    "we are aiming at a rough theoretical estimation of the boundaries of the demixing transition with constant external fields @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "this was already put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite for parallel forces and is generalized here to the general case of non - parallel forces .",
    "consider first a central collision between an @xmath0 and @xmath2 particle pair , see fig .",
    "[ sketch ] . transforming the trajectories onto one with a fixed common center of mass of the two particles",
    ", one realizes that the collision is effectively driven by half of the force difference , @xmath75 for @xmath0 particles and @xmath76 for @xmath2 particles .",
    "a transition towards patterned lanes is expected if @xmath77 is larger than a typical _ average force _ between @xmath0 and @xmath2 particles , and lane formation is induced .",
    "the latter force depends both on density and on the external fields themselves .",
    "we estimate a typical average force between two opposite particles by considering different `` effective '' interparticle spacings",
    ". the first typical interparticle spacing is set by the density alone , @xmath78 .",
    "including fluctuations in the interparticle distance induced by a finite temperature results in a further smaller effective average distance @xmath79 as obtained by setting a typical interparticle energy equal to @xmath80 . hence @xmath81 $ ] where @xmath82 is the inverse function of the interaction potential @xmath5 .",
    "finally the presence of the external fields enforces an even smaller averaged distance @xmath83 between two colliding opposite particles .",
    "we estimate this minimum distance @xmath83 by adding the net force per colliding particle @xmath84 to the force at distance @xmath79 via @xmath85 , \\label{c1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is the inverse function of @xmath87 . in general ,",
    "an @xmath61 particle pair will not collide directly along @xmath88 such that the actual average distance is between @xmath83 and @xmath79 .",
    "hence the averaged force @xmath89 between an @xmath0 and a @xmath2 particle is roughly @xmath90 .",
    "\\label{c2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the critical force difference @xmath91 is reached when it becomes of the order of the mean force @xmath89 , @xmath92 @xmath93 is a dimensionless prefactor which is determined by an optimal fit to all simulation results for parallel forces @xcite .",
    "the basic prediction of this simple theory is that the only essential parameter governing tilted lane formation is the magnitude @xmath94 .",
    "this prediction can be tested by simulation .",
    "in fact , in fig . [ phase ] , the critical value of @xmath95 is shown for different ratios @xmath69 .",
    "were the theory correct , all the simulation data should fall on a horizontal line independent of @xmath72 .",
    "as can be deduced from fig .",
    "[ phase ] , this is indeed confirmed .",
    "furthermore , the actual magnitude predicted from the theory is in line with the simulation data .",
    "note that - as far as the non - parallel case is concerned - there is no fit parameter involved .",
    "the global fit parameter @xmath96 is solely adjusted to the case of parallel forces .",
    "the model and all methods and arguments can readily be generalized to three spatial dimensions .",
    "similar conclusions hold for the formation of tilted lanes .",
    "we have also performed computer simulations in a cubic box in three dimensions and observed tilted lane formation .",
    "results are presented in fig .",
    "[ ss_3d ] : tilted lane formation is clearly visible in the plane spanned by the two forces @xmath73 and @xmath74 , see fig .",
    "[ ss_3d ] ( a ) .",
    "perpendicular to the direction @xmath97 of the lanes , the system shows a structure reminiscent of two - dimensional spinodal decomposition , see fig .",
    "[ ss_3d ] ( b ) .",
    "the parameters are for these snapshots @xmath64 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 . in conclusion",
    ", this shows that pattern formation is a general effect which is independent of the dimensionality of the model .",
    "in this section we focus on a brownian _ crystal _ which is driven by an external field . to this end , the external fields acting onto @xmath0 and @xmath2 particles are parallel ( @xmath100 ) but in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite the field - free equilibrium initial state is a triangular crystal .",
    "the case of a fluid field - free configuration is easier as rotational symmetry with respect to the direction of the external field applied is ensured .",
    "this is no longer true for a crystal where one has to specify the field direction with respect to the crystalline orientation resulting in an anisotropy which reflects the crystalline symmetry .",
    "clearly , in the absence of any external field , @xmath0 and @xmath2 particles are indistinguishable ; hence the equilibrium state is randomly occupied triangular crystal . in the other limit of very strong fields ,",
    "one expects again phase separation into completely demixed @xmath0 and @xmath2 regions .",
    "once they are demixed , they follow boltzmann statistics . consequently the equilibrium state is a pure @xmath0 ( or @xmath2 ) crystal of the same lattice than the original ( field free ) one .",
    "what is less clear intuitively is how the system transforms from the first randomly occupied crystal into the demixed crystal if the field is turned continuously on .",
    "at least two scenarios are conceivable : either the system retains the underlying solid lattice but particle exchange hopping processes generated by the external field demix the crystalline state or the crystal first melts mechanically via the external field and then crystallizes again . in our simulations",
    "we almost exclusively observed the latter scenario .    in order to detect a triangular crystalline order",
    "we define a suitable crystallinity order parameter @xmath101 that probes sixfold symmetry around a given particle via @xcite @xmath102 here the @xmath103-sum includes the six nearest neighbors of the given particle and the @xmath104-sum extends over @xmath7 particles in the simulation box .",
    "the large angular brackets indicate a time average .",
    "@xmath105 is the polar angle of the interparticle distance vector with respect to a fixed reference frame . for ideal sixfold symmetry , i.e. , for a perfect triangular crystal , @xmath106 .",
    "thermal fluctuations cause deviations from this ideal case but a value of @xmath107 @xcite is conveniently taken to be conclusive evidence for a triangular crystal .    in fig .",
    "[ order parameter ] we plot @xmath101 versus the difference external force @xmath108 for fixed parameters @xmath109 , and @xmath110 .    the direction of the force is ( 11)-direction of the triangular crystal . note that in contrast to the parameters used in section [ nonparallel ] , the interactions energy is much larger to ensure that the equilibrium field - free state is crystalline .",
    "indeed the crystallinity order parameter in the field - free case is around @xmath111 . upon increasing the external field strength to @xmath112 ,",
    "the crystallinity order parameter sharply drops down and stays to values close to zero indicating a melting of the crystal induced by the external field .",
    "this melting process is mainly caused by a mechanical stress induced by the external field with respect to @xmath61 particle pairs .",
    "as the field is getting larger ( @xmath113 ) , the order parameter @xmath101 increases again to values close to 0.7 .",
    "this is accompanied with lane formation as indicated by a drastic increase of another order parameter @xmath114 defined in ref .",
    "@xcite which is sensitive to lane formation .",
    "the whole scenario is illustrated also by simulation snapshots shown in fig .",
    "[ sssolid ] . while fig .",
    "[ sssolid ] ( a ) corresponds to a field - free randomly mixed crystal , fig .",
    "[ sssolid ] ( b ) and ( c ) are in the molten state while fig .",
    "[ sssolid ] ( d ) represents a refrozen demixed crystal sliding against each other . in fig .",
    "[ sssolid ] ( b ) and ( c ) worm like structures along the fields occur as a precursor to lanes formed by solids .",
    "consequently we have shown evidence for a _ reentrant freezing _ behavior generated by external fields in non - equilibrium .",
    "a qualitative similar situation occurs for colloidal solids in linear shear flow @xcite .",
    "a continuous increase of the shear rate can lead to shear - melting and subsequent recrystallization into a different solid structure @xcite .",
    "a similar effect is shear thinning and subsequent shear thickening as observed in colloidal fluids for increasing shear rates @xcite .",
    "to summarize : we have generalized earlier studies of non - equilibrium pattern formation in continuum driven diffusive mixtures to non - parallel external fields and crystalline states . as main results",
    "we found tilted lanes along the force difference vector which are wandering with a constant interface velocity provided the external force difference is large enough .",
    "furthermore , a solid melts and refreezes if the magnitude of an external field is increased .",
    "let us remark on possibilities of non - equilibrium lane formation in more complicated systems : first , our system studied was completely symmetric involving the same partial densities and the same particle - particle interactions . for experimental realizations @xcite",
    "this will not be fulfilled in general",
    ". however , the basic physics of lane formation will not change . secondly ,",
    "if ternary and further multicomponent mixture beyond binary ones are considered , we expect cascades of lane formation transitions involving the different particles species as the external field is increased .",
    "we finally comment on possible experimental realizations of our model : there are different fields where the pattern formation we predicted within our model can be verified , namely in colloidal dynamics and in pedestrian motion . _",
    "binary colloidal mixtures _ indeed can be driven by constant external forces .",
    "important examples for are sedimentation where the external force is gravity @xcite or electrokinetic motion of charged colloids @xcite where the external force is an electric field .",
    "both the fluid and crystalline field - free state can be studied . a recent realization with mixed crystals",
    "can be found in @xcite .",
    "one possible drawback is the hydrodynamic backflow @xcite caused by strong hydrodynamic interactions @xcite which were neglected in our model .",
    "an overall backflow can be avoided by a time dependent oscillatory field ( e.g. ac electric field ) which leads qualitatively to the same lane formation if its frequency is small enough @xcite .",
    "we further think that the long - ranged hydrodynamic flow around a driven colloidal particle will favor lane formation , i.e.  the critical field strength needed to generate lane formation is expected to be lower than with hydrodynamic interactions neglected .",
    "colloids can also be exposed to external laser - optical and magnetic filed @xcite which generate external forces in a controlled way coupling to the dielectricity ( resp .  the magnetic permeability ) of the colloidal material .",
    "in colloidal mixtures can be realized by crossing two external fields e.g. gravity with electric , laser - optical with electric , laser - optical with magnetic etc .",
    "the two species of a colloidal mixture will in general respond differently to the two external fields such that the resulting total external force will be different in direction .",
    "a different realization is _ dynamics of pedestrians _ in pedestrian zones and in lecture halls .",
    "similar off - lattice models involving brownian particles have been used to simulate the collective behavior of pedestrians @xcite including escape panic @xcite .",
    "our setup of perpendicular external fields is realized by two crossing pedestrian lanes in which pedestrians are only moving in one direction . based on our results",
    ", we would expect tilted lane formation provided the density of the pedestrians is high enough",
    ". finally it would be interesting to extend phenomenological hydrodynamical theories which predict lane formation for parallel forces via an instability @xcite to the case of tilted forces .",
    "work along these lines is in progress .",
