    "qcd is distinguished from the constituent quark models of hadronic physics by the presence of light sea quarks in the vacuum and one of the principal goals of lattice field theory is to provide an accurate theoretical description of their effects .",
    "the topological charge , @xmath6 , and its associated susceptibility , @xmath0 , are especially sensitive to the presence and properties of the sea quarks .",
    "chiral perturbation theory describes their variation with the quark mass , @xmath2 . by comparing lattice monte carlo measurements with this expectation",
    ", we may understand how near we are to achieving the above aim .",
    "initial work on unimproved sea quark formulations ( wilson @xcite and staggered @xcite ) showed only weak evidence for the expected chiral ( @xmath7 ) suppression of @xmath0 relative to the quenched ( @xmath8 ) theory at an equivalent lattice spacing , @xmath3 ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "a clearer chiral reduction was seen for improved fermion formulations , probably as a result of better chiral symmetry at finite lattice spacing @xcite .",
    "@xmath9improved sheikholeslami  wohlert ( sw , or `` clover '' ) wilson fermions showed a strong sea quark effect in a study at quasi  fixed lattice spacing , @xmath10 @xcite ; mean field improved sw quarks also showed an effect @xcite .",
    "improved staggered fermion studies have also shown clear suppression of @xmath0 over a range of lattice spacings @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "studies using lattice sea quark formulations with chiral properties more comparable to those of the continuum have so far been limited to two dimensional models @xcite . in the light of the improved staggered results , it is interesting to examine the effects of finite lattice spacing on the topological susceptibility from @xmath9improved sw quarks . this is useful not only from the theoretical viewpoint , but also when comparing the relative costs of producing independent field configurations in monte carlo simulations ( the topological modes are expected to be amongst the slowest to decorrelate ) .    in this paper we extend the analysis of two flavour @xmath12improved sw results at @xmath10 ( included in this work with due acknowledgment ) to cover a comparable range of lattice spacings to the improved staggered fermion study , using lattice qcd ensembles produced by the ukqcd and qcdsf collaborations .",
    "moving to small quark masses ( the lightest yet produced for wilson  like fermions ) , we find strong evidence for the chiral suppression of @xmath0 .",
    "finite volume effects are shown to be under control , and no strong autocorrelation is seen for the topological charge . we perform a joint continuum chiral and continuum extrapolation , and find good agreement with theoretical expectations .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec_top_susc ] we review the theoretical expectations for the chiral variation of the topological susceptibility in the continuum and on the lattice .",
    "we describe our measurements in section  [ sec_meas ] , and discuss their variation with @xmath2 , @xmath3 and the lattice volume .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in section  [ sec_summary ] .",
    "four  dimensional , euclidean gauge fields can be classified by an integer  valued topological charge , @xmath13 in the absence of a @xmath14term , @xmath15 and the topological susceptibility , @xmath16 , has a finite , non  zero limit as the volume @xmath17 .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , > , > , > \" , ]      there is a significant suppression of the topological susceptibility in the chiral limit . in fig .",

    "( [ eqn_chi_chi ] ) , using the physical value for @xmath18 .",
    "there is approximate agreement for @xmath19 , although we note that discretisation effects tend to increase @xmath0 and exaggerate the range of agreement .",
    "we do not see clear evidence for @xmath0 deviating from a rapid decrease with @xmath2 at finite lattice spacing as in @xcite , although critical slowing prevents exploration of sea quarks comparably light with those simulated in that study .    to quantify the effects of lattice artifacts ,",
    "it is useful to consider @xmath0 over the full range of sea quark masses . assuming that eqn .",
    "( [ eqn_nlge_a ] ) holds , we can use it to perform a chiral extrapolation of @xmath0 whilst allowing for ( leading order ) discretisation effects .",
    "we exclude ensemble @xmath20 , whose statistical error is probably unreliable , and ensemble @xmath21 which has a small volume ( see on ) .",
    "ensembles @xmath22 also have large autocorrelation , and we remark that excluding them from the fitted data had no statistically significant effect .",
    "we fit only the dynamical results , with the quenched parameters fixed . in principle",
    "we could avoid this and fit the quenched data as well , assigning all such points an arbitrarily large value of @xmath23 .",
    "such fits do not converge well , however .",
    "this was probably as a result of the data being arranged as two distinct clusters in @xmath23 .",
    "we show the fits to eqn .",
    "( [ eqn_nlge_a ] ) in table  [ tab_fits ] , with the @xmath24 results ( fit  1 ) plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_r04_chi ] for a representative sample of lattice spacings , and in fig .",
    "[ fig_3d ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that even for the heaviest sea quarks simulated , the discretisation effects act to increase @xmath0 . to see a crossover to the quenched behaviour ( where a decrease is seen ) , the fits suggest we need @xmath25 .",
    "it is thus clear that for all the ensembles the vacuum has been qualitatively altered from that of the quenched theory by the presence of the sea quarks .",
    "as expected , topological degrees of freedom appear to be more sensitive to such changes than most hadronic observables .    for @xmath26 ( the range studied in @xcite ) , these fits suggest @xmath27 , where the errors arise from those on @xmath28 , @xmath29 and the above range of @xmath30 respectively .",
    "this figure agrees very closely with @xmath31 obtained in the previous work for eqn .",
    "( [ eqn_nlge ] ) , and gives confidence in the consistency of our fits .",
    "in addition to the errors arising from the statistical variation in the data , there is also a systematic error arising from the uncertainty in the quenched behaviour .",
    "we attempt to account for this by repeating the fits with @xmath32 and @xmath33 varying by one standard deviation in each direction : @xmath28 varies by @xmath34 under this , and it is clear that this is a sub  leading effect that can be ignored .",
    "the fitted @xmath35 corresponds to @xmath36 .",
    "this agrees surprisingly well both with the experimental ( and 2 + 1flavour ) qcd measurement ( @xmath37 ) and measurements by other methods on @xmath38 sw actions ( @xmath39 in these conventions , rescaled from @xcite ) .",
    "the leading order lattice spacing correction to this increases @xmath18 , as expected .",
    "the size of this correction is consistent with those obtained for other methods ( see fig .",
    "35 of @xcite , for instance , although the different gauge actions and operators will , of course , lead to different lattice artifacts ) .",
    "it is useful here to consider whether there is any evidence for @xmath0 having a non ",
    "zero chiral limit at finite @xmath3 . in fit  2 of table  [ tab_fits ]",
    "we show the result lifting the restriction @xmath40 .",
    "the fits are extremely unstable ; the first column is the result of starting with all free parameters being zero , whilst the second takes the results of fit  1 as the initial values .",
    "this instability probably arises from the most chiral data points being clustered around @xmath41 .",
    "we conclude that whilst we can not rule out a non  zero chiral limit , the data appears to be described more consistently when such a term is not present . for the remainder of the paper we therefore concentrate on the results from fit  1 .      in @xcite the lattice volumes were sufficiently large that the topological charge on subvolumes ( of size @xmath42 ) varied independently",
    "; indeed a reduction in statistical error on @xmath0 was achieved by exploiting this self  averaging .",
    "we did not find the same in the this study , and this prompts us to consider more carefully whether the topological susceptibility exhibits finite volume contamination .",
    "in general we expect finite volume effects to lead to a reduction in @xmath0 : a small lattice excludes large instantons . in the quenched theory",
    "this restriction is negligible once @xmath43 @xcite . with dynamical sea quarks present , small volumes can",
    ", in addition , see a restoration of chiral symmetry with the leading order chiral variation now being @xmath44 avoiding this requires @xmath45 , although the precise limit is not known . what is also not clear is how the behaviour interpolates between this and eqn .",
    "( [ eqn_xls ] ) as we vary @xmath46 ; we do not address this in this study .    finally , we need the lattice to be large in units of the pion correlation length , @xmath47 .",
    "spectroscopy suggests @xmath48 is necessary to render the low - lying hadron states free of finite volume effects @xcite .",
    "this limit is , however , associated more with pion exchange than phase structure and is probably unduly stringent for this study .    in table",
    "[ tab_ensembles ] we show all three measures of fves .",
    "all the above limits seem well satisfied and we do not expect , or see , any sign of chiral symmetry restoration or significant finite volume effects .",
    "certainly we do not see the smaller volumes lying consistently below the fitted curve .",
    "the ensembles @xmath49 vary only in volume , and no strong suppression of @xmath0 is seen as @xmath50 is reduced .",
    "nonetheless , we choose to exclude @xmath21 , the smallest lattice , from the scaling analysis as the volume is particularly small",
    ".    we can attempt to quantify the effects of finite volume by repeating the fit with @xmath24 , progressively excluding the ensembles with the smallest @xmath46 ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ... ) until the fits become unreliable .",
    "the fit parameters remained consistent within statistical errors .",

    "solid ( blue )  points and error bars denote data points lying above the fitted surface .",

    "we have carried out a systematic study of the topological susceptibility , @xmath0 , in lattice qcd with two light quark flavours over a range of lattice spacings and sea quark masses using ensembles generated by the ukqcd and qcdsf collaborations .",
    "we find compelling evidence for suppression of @xmath0 with decreasing quark mass .",
    "finite volume contamination of the results was not seen , and @xmath54 is necessary to avoid such effects on the topological degrees of freedom .",
    "we observe a slight ( and , in truth , statistically insignificant ) increase in the integrated autocorrelation of the topological charge , @xmath6 , as the sea quark mass is reduced , although this effect is not marked despite a critical slowing of the hmc algorithm @xcite .",
    "the autocorrelation times are , in general , small enough not to bias the jack  knife estimates of the statistical errors on our data .",
    "there have been suggestions that at @xmath55 the @xmath38 @xmath9improved sw action exhibits evidence for a nearby phase transition @xcite .",
    "this transition affects most strongly observables with the quantum numbers of the vacuum , and we do not expect ( or find ) a strong effect on the topological susceptibility .",
    "it may , however , induce additional mass dependence in @xmath30 @xcite , although we see no signal in @xmath56 ( whose fourth power would presumably magnify any such effect , distorting the data away from eqn .",
    "( [ eqn_nlge_a ] ) ) .",
    "it may also lead to large autocorrelation @xcite . whilst a large integrated autocorrelation is seen for one ensemble at large sea quark mass ,",
    "this is at @xmath57 which does not immediately fit the hypothesis of @xcite .",
    "no unexpected trends were seen for @xmath58 .",
    "the chiral variation of the data was compared to a theoretically motivated ansatz for the behaviour of @xmath0 over the full range of sea quark masses .",
    "this was extended to allow for variation of @xmath0 with the lattice spacing , and a joint chiral / continuum extrapolation was carried out for @xmath59 ( over a factor of 2 in @xmath60 ) .",
    "the behaviour was as expected : the continuum limit of @xmath36 was remarkably consistent with physical expectations , with discretisation effects tending to increase its value ( as seen in other determinations @xcite ) .",
    "the discretisation effects tended to increase the topological susceptibility on all the ensembles .",
    "this agrees with expectations for the chiral limit and is in contrast to the quenched theory , where they suppress @xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that , relative to the quenched theory , there are fundamental differences in the vacuum due to sea quarks , even for the largest @xmath2 .",
    "the topological susceptibility is more sensitive to these differences than , for example , most quantities in the light hadron spectrum .    in summary ,",
    "the topological susceptibility is a sensitive probe of the vacuum and chiral properties of the lattice action .",
    "although the @xmath9improved sw action formally breaks the chiral symmetry at finite lattice spacing , the behaviour of @xmath0 suggests that the effects are not significant at the lattice spacings simulated .",
    "the chiral behaviour of this action is comparably good to that of other actions currently used in large ",
    "scale simulations , and makes it a suitable laboratory for studying topologically sensitive states , including the @xmath61 meson .",
