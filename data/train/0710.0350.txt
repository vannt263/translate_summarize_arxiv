    "<S> we study the relation between chern numbers and quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) in the xy spin - chain model . by coupling the spin chain to a single spin , </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to study topological invariants associated to the coupling hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> these invariants contain global information , in addition to the usual one ( obtained by integrating the berry connection around a closed loop ) . </S>",
    "<S> we compute these invariants ( chern numbers ) and discuss their relation to qpt . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we show that chern numbers can be used to label regions corresponding to different phases .    ,    </S>",
    "<S> berry phases , topological invariants , quantum phase transitions 03.65.vf , 64.70.-p    recently , a close connection between berry phases ( bp ) associated to quantum many - body systems and quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) has emerged , attracting much attention @xcite . from an experimental point of view </S>",
    "<S> such a connection is very interesting , due to the robustness of bp against continuous changes in the system s parameters . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> it has been proposed by carollo et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the existence of a qpt could be detected , without having to undergo a phase transition , through a cyclic evolution in parameter space . in that work </S>",
    "<S> , the authors have shown that a bp can be defined for the xy model whose behavior with respect to the system s parameters reflects the presence of qpt . </S>",
    "<S> they computed the relative geometric phase between the ground and first excited states for loops around the xx criticality region and found that its derivative presents a singular behavior at the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> zhu  @xcite , working also with the xy model , obtained similar results for the derivative of the bp corresponding to the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> he also analyzed the scaling behavior of the bp , showing that it can be used as a signature of quantum criticality . </S>",
    "<S> plastina et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite found , using the dicke model , that the bp vanishes exactly ( in the thermodynamic limit ) in the region corresponding to the normal phase and is greater than zero in the super - radiant phase . </S>",
    "<S> they also found a singular behavior of the derivative of the bp at the critical point . yet another proposal to detect qpt using berry phases </S>",
    "<S> has been put forward by hamma  @xcite .    all these examples point towards a very general , model independent relation between bp and qpt . in order to understand the origin of this relation , </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to recognize general patterns that may emerge from concrete examples . </S>",
    "<S> it is a well known fact , first pointed out by simon  @xcite that given a parameter - dependent hamiltonian @xmath0 , the bp corresponding to the @xmath1 ( non - degenerate ) energy band @xmath2 , arises as the holonomy of a connection defined on the line bundle spanned by the family of all eigenvectors @xmath3 , as @xmath4 varies over the parameter space , where @xmath5 but in the examples related to qpt studied so far , it is not clear what -exactly- the base space of the bundle is . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , all computations rely on the introduction of an additional parameter through a unitary transformation of the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> then the berry phase for a special class of loops in this extended parameter space is computed , leading to the results reported in references @xcite .    in this work , using the model proposed in @xcite , we intend to go a step further in the sense that , for each value of the external field ( @xmath6 ) , we identify a space ( isomorphic to the two - sphere ) and a corresponding line bundle @xmath7 over it , for which a topological invariant @xmath8 can be computed . as shown below , this invariant </S>",
    "<S> is closely related to the phase transition of the @xmath9 model at the critical value @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> following yuan et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we start by considering a system consisting of a spin chain coupled to a central spin , with hamiltonian @xmath11 , where @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 the pauli matrices @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) describe , respectively , the central spin and the spin on the @xmath18 site of the environmental spin chain . as can be read from eqns . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:2])-([eq:4 ] ) , the parameters @xmath19 describe the coupling to the external field and the strength of the interaction among spins . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath20 accounts for the anisotropy in the spin chain . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the spin chain is in its ground state , the following effective mean - field hamiltonian for the central spin can be obtained  @xcite : @xmath21 here @xmath22 satisfies @xmath23 , with @xmath24 following references @xcite , we change the hamiltonian by means of a unitary transformation @xmath25 to @xmath26 if we keep all parameters appearing in @xmath27 fixed , with the exception of @xmath28 and @xmath20 , we can regard this hamiltonian as defined on the surface of a two dimensional sphere , obtained by stereographic projection from the plane with polar coordinates @xmath29 and @xmath30 , given that we restrict the parameter @xmath31 to the limiting case @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the compactification of the @xmath28-@xmath20 plane to a sphere is possible in that limiting case , because then the eigenvectors of @xmath27 do not depend on @xmath28 when @xmath33 . as mentioned above a parameter - dependent hamiltonian induces , for each non - degenerate energy band , a line bundle over the parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> this line bundle comes equipped with a connection whose holonomy is precisely the geometric or berry phase corresponding to the given eigenstate  @xcite . in the present case </S>",
    "<S> , we are regarding the hamiltonian @xmath27 as depending on the two parameters @xmath28 and @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state of @xmath34 is readily shown  @xcite to be given by : @xmath35 where @xmath36 this ground state generates a line bundle @xmath7 over the sphere , whose topology is characterized by the first chern number , a topological invariant that can be expressed as an integral over the parameter space ( two - sphere ) as  @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the projector @xmath39 .    after a long but straightforward calculation we obtain , in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath40 \\\\    </S>",
    "<S> \\frac{1}{2 } \\left (    \\mbox{sign}\\left ( \\mu+2 j g \\right ) </S>",
    "<S> -\\mbox{sign}(\\mu ) \\right ) , &   \\lambda>1,\\\\         \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] with @xmath41 equation ( [ eq:5 ] ) is the main result of this paper . </S>",
    "<S> it shows that a topological invariant can be extracted from the effective hamiltonian @xmath27 that contains information about the qpt of the environmental spin chain at @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> the interest of this result lies in the fact that it may be possible , in a general case , to express @xmath8 as a function of the expectation values of certain physical observables . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to bp , that depends not only on the topology of the state space but on the path followed in parameter space , the chern number is a purely topological quantity , an integer that is robust against continuous perturbations of the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> this same idea can be applied to the ground state of the @xmath9 spin chain ( without the coupling to a central spin ) . in that case , the chern number scales with the number @xmath43 of spins , but after normalization with @xmath43 , one obtains a function that also reflects the presence of a qpt at the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> this result , and potential applications thereof , will be reported elsewhere . </S>"
