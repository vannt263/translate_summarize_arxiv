    "recently , optical properties of composites have attracted great interest . in order to open new possibilities in the information processing and transmission",
    ", a large optical nonlinearity may be desirable@xmath1 .",
    "composite materials , especially , small metal particles embedded in a dielectric host and metal clusters on the nanometer scale , exhibit a strong nonlinear optical enhancement through the inhomogeneous local - field and geometric - response effect@xmath2 .",
    "it is also known that these composites give rise to an anomalously large absorption in the infrared spectrum@xmath3 . to analyze the optical responses , it is more convenient to adopt the spectral representation@xmath4 . for various anisotropic composites ,",
    "the spectral density was calculated as a function of volume fractions @xmath5 and @xmath6 by the effective - medium approximation ( ema)@xmath7 .",
    "it was found a large nonlinear optical enhancement , as well as the separation of the absorption peak from the nonlinear enhancement peak .",
    "by ema , the fluctuation of local field has been averaged out .",
    "so it is difficult to find the physical origins of the optical enhancement and the separation of optical peaks . in this connection , greens - function formalism ( gff )",
    "was developed to deal with the optical responses of the arbitrary - shaped metallic clusters embedded in the infinite dielectric networks at the quasistatic limit@xmath8 . by the formalism",
    ", the resonance spectrum and local field distribution for each eigenmode can be analytically obtained .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the linear and nonlinear optical responses throuth the dilute anisotropic networks in view of the local field distribution .    in the following ,",
    "a binary dilute anisotropy network is considered .",
    "we use the random generator to produce the geometric anisotropy .",
    "the metallic bonds parallel to the applied field are assigned with the fraction @xmath5 , and metallic bonds perpendicular to the applied field with @xmath6 . in the dilute systems ,",
    "the condition , @xmath9 , is satisfied .",
    "when we change @xmath5 from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , the corresponding @xmath6 varies from @xmath10 to @xmath12 . in section",
    "ii , the green s functions for the effective linear response @xmath13 and effective nonlinear response @xmath14 are derived . in section iii , the inverse participation ratios ( ipr ) with @xmath0 are used to represent the localized and extended eigenstates in anisotropic networks . in section vi , the spectra of the absorption and the third order nonlinear enhancement are illustrated .",
    "when the applied field is parallel to the anisotropy of the networks , the overlap of the absorption peak with nonlinear enhancement peak is found within the interval @xmath15 .",
    "in contrast , for the perpendicular applied field , the separation of the absorption peak from nonlinear enhancement peak is enhanced when the anisotropy @xmath5 is increased .",
    "these results are explained in section iii , numerically confirmed in section vi , and concluded in section v.",
    "consider an infinite binary network as shown in fig .",
    "1 , where the impurity bonds with admittance @xmath16 are employed to replace the bonds in an otherwise homogeneous network of identical admittance @xmath17 .",
    "the admittance of each bond is generally complex and frequency - dependent .",
    "all the impurity bonds construct the clusters subspace .",
    "when resonance happens , the potential of the jointing points can be computed by the gff . instead of the point source @xmath18 ,",
    "the source term is replaced by @xmath19 at the point @xmath20 .",
    "hence in the subspace , @xmath21 is a linear combination of right eigenvector @xmath22 s of greens - matrix m , @xmath23and for the site @xmath24 outside the cluster , @xmath25 becomes @xmath26    in the uniform field @xmath27 along @xmath28 direction , @xmath21 reads @xmath29for a binary network with @xmath30 square lattices , in the quasistatic limit , the displacement @xmath31 of the @xmath32th bond is related to the local field @xmath33 by the relation @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the dielectric constant and @xmath36 is the third order nonlinear susceptibility of the bond .",
    "@xmath37 are set to be @xmath38 for the impurity bonds , and @xmath39 for the matrix bonds respectively . by the finite difference transformation , the effective linear response along the applied field is @xmath40with the magnitude of field @xmath41 and lattice constant @xmath42 , where @xmath43 means that @xmath20 and @xmath44 are the nearest neighbors in the same cluster while @xmath45 means @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the nearest neighbors but not in the same cluster .",
    "when we employ @xmath48 , @xmath49 can be expressed by the points within the clusters subspace as , @xmath50here @xmath51 , so we have @xmath52because @xmath20 and @xmath44 are neighbors , the values of @xmath53 can be only @xmath54 or @xmath55 . physically , the absorption along the applied field is larger than that along the perpendicular direction of the applied field . in the following calculations , @xmath13 always represents the absorption along the applied field . for simplicity , we let @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the imaginary part of @xmath59 corresponding to the absorption is @xmath60@xmath61 , referred to as the cross section , obeys the sum rule@xmath62 , @xmath63where @xmath64 is the number of horizontal bonds along the applied field .    since the local fields are determined completely , our formulas can be used to calculate the nonlinear response . by relating the total electrostatic energy to the effective coefficients , the third order nonlinearity @xmath65",
    "is defined by@xmath66@xmath67,\\]]where @xmath68 is the space averaged electric field . for the infinite networks , @xmath69 and the nonlinear response function",
    "is given by@xmath70 .",
    "@xmath71where the summation is over all bonds and @xmath72 is the(general complex ) potential difference across the bond @xmath32 and for two dimensional case , @xmath73 .",
    "when all the bonds have nonlinear term , i.e. , @xmath74 , with the lattice constant @xmath42 , the effective nonlinear response is written as @xmath75the third order nonlinearity @xmath14 is expressed as the summation of the forth moment of local electric field .",
    "so the fluctuation of local electric field enhances the nonlinear optical responses well .",
    "first , the ipr of eigenvectors of greens - matrix @xmath76 in the eigensystem with @xmath77 jointing points are defined .",
    "the @xmath78th normalized right eigenvector is @xmath79with @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the ipr of @xmath82 is written as@xmath83 , @xmath84here @xmath0 .",
    "the calculation of ipr@xmath85 is limited in the nontrivial eigenstates .",
    "the number of ipr@xmath85 is equal to or less than @xmath77 . in the above eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , it is found that the right eigenvectors of @xmath76 are closely related to the local fields of the impurity cluster in the subspace .",
    "so the ipr can be used to represent the localization of the eigenstates .",
    "the ipr amplify the profiles of eigenstates , namely , the localized states become more pronounced and extended states become smoother .",
    "hence , the larger values of ipr are always corresponding to the stronger optical responses .",
    "this will be verified in the following sections .    to consider the size effect ,",
    "the ipr in the dilute isotropic composites with @xmath86 and @xmath87 are shown in fig .",
    "2 . in this figure ,",
    "two samples are in size @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the peaks represent the localized states and the valleys correspond to the extended states . comparing the distribution of peaks and valleys in two samples , we find that the size effect is not very obvious .",
    "it is also seen that the density of states are larger around @xmath90 than that around @xmath91 or @xmath92 .",
    "the localized states incline to accumulate @xmath91 or @xmath92 , while , the extended states are near @xmath90 .",
    "so there exists a duality about @xmath93 .",
    "the high values of ipr imply the strong optical responses at @xmath91 or @xmath92 .    @xmath94    fig .",
    "3 displays the ipr of the dilute anisotropic systems .",
    "we have known that the resonance spectrum is very sensitive to the microstructure@xmath95 .",
    "for each case , comparing two samples , we see that the peaks of ipr are very stable though their microstructure is completely different .",
    "so in the following , for the definite parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 , it is reasonable to investigate the optical responses by only one sample . when the anisotropy is increased from fig .",
    "3(a ) to fig .",
    "3(g ) , the localized states incline towards @xmath96 or @xmath97 .",
    "the distributions of localized and extended states have roughly the same feature as that in the isotropic case , i.e. , we find more localized states at @xmath91 and @xmath92 than at @xmath90 , but denser at @xmath90 .",
    "the distribution of ipr is caused purely by the morphology of the sample . in the next section",
    ", we will discuss how the different applied fields act on the optical responses when the geometric anisotropy is increased .",
    "the optical responses can be properly described by the absorption spectrum @xmath98 and the third order nonlinear enhancement spectrum as shown in fig . 4 and fig .",
    "when the applied field is parallel to the direction of anisotropy , it affects the optical properties well .",
    "the envelopes of the absorption and third order nonlinear enhancements become narrower and the intensity is more enhanced with the increasing anisotropy .",
    "the main optical peaks are ranged in the interval @xmath99 $ ] , which correspond to the dipolar approximation . in this figure",
    ", we can not find the separation of the absorption peak from the third order nonlinear enhancement peak .",
    "the results of single sample conflict with those of previous works@xmath95 .",
    "the reason is that the ema has averaged out the fluctuation of local field , which plays the central role for the effective optical responses . at @xmath90 , the density of localized states",
    "are much smaller than that of extended states .",
    "the optical properties of the specific sample are determined by its own eigenstates , not by `` effective medium '' .",
    "so it is not reasonable for all of the cases to express the optical properties of one specific sample only by the same macroscopic parameters @xmath5 and @xmath100 . in fig .",
    "5 , when the applied field is perpendicular to the anisotropy , the optical responses of the dilute anisotropic samples are plotted .",
    "it is seen that the peaks of absorption are red - shifted while the peaks of the third order nonlinear enhancement are blue - shifted when the anisotropy is added .",
    "there is a larger peak separation with increasing geometric anisotropy .",
    "for all the applied fields , it is natural to find a large third order nonlinear enhancement and a broad infared absorption because the localized states exist in the whole resonant area . only for the perpendicular applied field ,",
    "the separation of optical peaks is found .",
    "@xmath94    @xmath94    then , the drude free electronic model is employed to calculate the optical properties of the dilute anisotropic composites .",
    "the admittance of the impurity metallic bonds is @xmath101where @xmath102 is the plasma frequency , and @xmath103 a damping constant . for metal , the plasma frequency @xmath104 ,",
    "being in the ultraviolet .",
    "we choose @xmath105 , which is the typical value of a metal , and @xmath106 , which is the dielectric constant of water for model calculations .",
    "the range of optical responses is @xmath107 .",
    "optical responses of various anisotropic networks are illustrated in fig .",
    "the nonlinear enhancement @xmath108(or @xmath14 ) is divided by @xmath109 for the comparison with the linear absorption .",
    "the direction of anisotropy in figs .",
    "6(a ) , ( c ) , ( e ) and ( g ) is parallel to the applied field .",
    "the peak at @xmath110 corresponds to the dipolar approximation of the whole system . in these figures ,",
    "the separation of absorption peak and nonlinear enhancement peak is not found , as observed in the above fig .",
    "4 . note that this result is different from that of the previous works@xmath111 .",
    "however , when the applied field is perpendicular to the anisotropy , as shown in fig .",
    "6(b ) , ( d ) , ( f ) and ( h ) , in each of which , both the separation of linear and nonlinear peaks , and the third order nonlinear enhancement are seen .",
    "in this paper , optical responses of dilute binary anisotropic networks are investigated numerically by the gff .",
    "green s functions for the effective linear and nonlinear responses are derived .",
    "the ipr with @xmath0 are given to describe the localization and extension of eigenstates .",
    "the spectra of the absorption and the third order nonlinear enhancement are exhibited for the different applied fields .",
    "we also compute the optical responses for the drude model . for the dilute anisotropic networks",
    ", we conclude that :    1 .",
    "the size effect of optical responses is not obvious .",
    "2 .   the ipr with @xmath0 can be used to represent the localization and extension of eigenstates .",
    "the wide optical absorption and large nonlinear enhancement are caused by the geometric anisotropy .",
    "4 .   the peaks of the absorption and nonlinear enhancement overlap when the applied field is parallel to the anisotropy . while , for the perpendicular applied field , the absorption peak is separated from the nonlinear enhancement peak . 5 .",
    "the structure sensitivity does not affect the main optical properties , but the details of optical responses .",
    "> from above 2 , 3 , 4 and the previous works@xmath7 , geometric anisotropy is the main reason to enhance the optical responses . for a specific sample ,",
    "when the different fields are applied , the positions of optical responses do not vary , but the local field distributions are quite different . therefore the optical properties of resonant composites are determined by the geometric anisotropy , as well as by the applied sources .",
