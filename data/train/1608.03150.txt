    "<S> we introduce the concept of spatio - temporal steering ( sts ) , which reduces , in special cases , to einstein - podolsky - rosen steering and the recently - introduced temporal steering . </S>",

    "<S> _ introduction.__quantum steering is an intriguing quantum phenomenon , which enables one party ( usually referred to as alice ) to use her different measurement settings to remotely prepare the set of quantum states of another spatially - separated party ( say bob ) . </S>",
    "<S> this ability , which is not achievable without quantum resources , was first described by schrdinger  @xcite in his response to the work of einstein , podolsky , and rosen ( epr )  @xcite on quantum entanglement and the related question about the completeness of quantum mechanics . as recently shown  @xcite , quantum steering ( </S>",
    "<S> also refereed to as epr steering ) is , in general , weaker than bell s nonlocality  @xcite but stronger than quantum entanglement  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after eighty years , quantum steering has been gradually formulated mathematically  @xcite and observed experimentally  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other developments include : using steering as a resource for quantum - information processing , quantifying steering  @xcite , clarifying its relationship to the problem of the incompatibility of measurements  @xcite , and multipartite quantum steering  @xcite , among various other generalizations and applications ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .    </S>",
    "<S> nonclassical temporal correlations ( like photon antibunching ) play a fundamental role in quantum optics research , since the hanbury - brown and twiss experiments  @xcite and the glauber theory of quantum coherence  @xcite . while there is as yet no clear temporal analog of quantum entanglement , attempts at defining such have led to new ideas about quantum causality ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> recently , temporal steering  @xcite was introduced as a temporal analog of epr steering , which refers to a nonclassical correlation of a single object at different times . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to temporal entanglement , temporal steering has a clear operational meaning  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , temporal steering was used for testing the security of quantum key distribution protocols  @xcite and for quantifying the non - markovian dynamics of open systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , temporal steering was also experimentally demonstrated  @xcite by measuring the violation of the temporal inequality presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a measure of temporal steering was proposed  @xcite and experimentally determined  @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce the concept of spatio - temporal steering ( sts ) as a natural unification of the epr and temporal forms of steering . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we propose two measures of sts , specifically , its robustness and weight . </S>",
    "<S> we also show the usefulness of sts in testing and quantifying nonclassical correlations of quantum networks by analyzing two examples , including the decay of nonclassical correlations in quantum excitation transfers in the fenna - matthews - olson ( fmo ) protein complex , which is one of the most widely studied photosynthetic complexes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that sts can also be applied to test quantum - state transfer in quantum networks like those described in refs .  </S>",

    "<S> _ _ temporal steering : from temporal hidden - variable model to temporal hidden - state model.__let us briefly review the so - called temporal hidden - state model for a single system at two moments of time  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consider that , during the evolution of the system from time @xmath0 to time @xmath1 , one can perform measurements using different settings @xmath2 and @xmath3 to obtain outcomes @xmath4 and @xmath5 at times 0 and @xmath1 , respectively . if one makes two assumptions : ( a1 ) noninvasive measurability at time @xmath0 , which means that one can obtain a measurement outcome without disturbing the system , and ( a2 ) macrorealism ( macroscopic realism )  @xcite , which means that the outcome of the system pre - exists , no matter if a measurement has been performed or not . under these conditions , there exist some hidden variables @xmath6 , which _ a priori _ determine the joint probability distributions @xmath7  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> now , if one replaces the assumption ( a2 ) with ( a2 ) , which means that during each moment of time the system can be described by a quantum state @xmath8 , which is determined by some hidden variables @xmath6 independent of the measurements performed before , then the hidden variables determine not only the observed data table @xmath9 at time @xmath10 , but also _ a priori _ the quantum state @xmath11 at time @xmath1 . </S>",

    "<S> we can see that if the dephasing rate @xmath68 is very small , the sts weight oscillates with time @xmath1 , revealing the coherent interaction between qubits 1 and 3 via the middle qubit . </S>",

    "<S> one can imagine that if the dephasing is very strong , it can inhibit the appearance of the sts weight . </S>",

    "<S> previously , quantum entanglement in the fmo complex has been theoretically analyzed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> given the fact that the excitation transfer is _ dynamic _ in nature , with a specific starting site ( site-1 or site-6 ) , it is more natural to examine the nonclassical correlation between sites at different times by using the sts measures . </S>",
    "<S> however , we point out that evaluating these measures requires measurements in different `` excitation '' bases at both source and target sites . thus </S>",
    "<S> , evaluating these measures represents an analysis of the network itself , and how quantum correlations propagate through it , much akin to the approach taken in  @xcite .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] , we numerically calculated the sts robustness of site-6 to other sites by using the haken - strobl equation of motion  @xcite ( see the supplementary material  @xcite ) . in plotting this figure , </S>",
    "<S> the temperature is chosen to be @xmath69  k with the corresponding dephasing rate @xmath71  @xmath70 and the decay rate ( into the reaction center from site-3 only ) @xmath72  @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> as seen from this figure , the largest sts robustness occurs from site-6 to site-5 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because site-6 and site-5 have the second largest intersite coupling ( @xmath73  @xmath70 ) in the whole network . another </S>",
    "<S> interesting fact is that the robustness of site-6 to site-7 has the second largest magnitude ( with a time delay ) and the longest _ vanishing time _ ( death time ) of the sts robustness . in view of the coupling strength of the hamiltonian , this may be due to the relative strong couplings of site-5 to site-4 ( @xmath7470.7  @xmath70 ) and site-4 to site-7 ( @xmath7461.5  @xmath70 ) , such that the influence from site-6 is transferred through these sites with a time delay . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the sts robustness not only gives the magnitude of the nonclassical correlations between two sites , but also gives the information of how long the nonclassical correlation takes to arrive , and how long it can be sustained .    _ </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions.__although the concept of spatio - temporal quantum entanglement is fundamentally difficult to be described consistently , we showed that sts , describing a certain type of spatio - temporal nonclassical correlations , can indeed be defined and quantified in an operational way . </S>",
    "<S> we hope that this may provide a wider view than the purely spatial or temporal correlations separately . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we showed that sts , with its measures , including the sts weight and sts robustness , can be useful to assess nonclassical correlations in quantum networks or other open quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> as an application , we described two examples of testing nonclassical correlations in a toy model of a three - qubit quantum network and in a more realistic model of the excitation transfer in the seven - site fmo complex . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that sts can be useful also for testing nonclassical correlations of more complex biological systems  @xcite and for describing quantum transport through artificial nano - structures  @xcite . </S>",
