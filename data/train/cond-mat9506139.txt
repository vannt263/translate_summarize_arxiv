    "the phase transition theory of nonequilibrium systems is an area of considerable interest .",
    "there is not such a clear view about critical universality classes as there is for equilibrium systems .",
    "the cellular automata ( ca ) approach for modelling nonequilibrium systems can be regarded as a general tool like differential equations .",
    "it introduces a space and time discretization  thus making the solution treatable  but preserving the features of interest .",
    "as was shown in @xcite ca models can describe very rich behavior .",
    "even the simplest one dimensional ca can have various phase transitions , can generate chaotic patterns , or show complex self - organizing or reproductive behavior .",
    "the directed percolation ( dp ) hypothesis @xcite states that all continuous transitions of a scalar order parameter to a unique absorbing state in dimension @xmath7 belong to the dp universality class , represented by the @xmath8 dimensional directed percolation @xcite or reggeon field theory .",
    "there are some additional conditions  usually not stated explicitly  to be fulfilled as well : short range interaction both in space and time , translational invariance , absence of multicritical points , and the non - vanishing probability for any active state to die locally .",
    "although there is no proof for this conjecture there exists a great number of models , which have been found to belong to this class .",
    "attempts to find counterexamples @xcite by other simulation results @xcite have been unsuccessful .",
    "the motivation of our investigation is to find a possible exception to the dp conjecture in the cellular automata phase transition of different dimensions .",
    "the stochastic cellular automata  investigated by bidaux , boccara and chat ( hereafter referred to as bbc ca ) @xcite and jensen @xcite using simulations  in one dimension showed controversial results concerning the universality class .",
    "steady state simulation gave non - dp whereas the time - dependent simulation resulted in the dp class . even though the latter method is considered to be more precise",
    ", arguments based on universality suggested that the same rule in two dimensions should produce a transition of 2 + 1 dimensional dp class .",
    "simulations proved this to be a first order transition @xcite . in order to clarify the situation we used various selection of different analytical and simulation methods .",
    "in addition we were interested in the change of universality by varying the lower acceptence value @xmath9 of the rule :    @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a two valued random variable such that    @xmath12    by setting up the mean - field steady state equation for the probability of ones ( c ) : @xmath13 the leading term in the polinomial function @xmath14 , which determines the critical behavior as @xmath15 ( and @xmath16 ) is @xmath17 for @xmath4 , @xmath18 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "in analogy with the equilibrium ising model  where the three - spin ising model has a different universality from the two - spin nearest neighbor ising model  we expected deviations from the dp behavior . to check this assumption we extended our investigation to the @xmath22 cases in one and two dimensions .",
    "the steady state monte carlo simulations ( stdmc ) were carried out on @xmath23 and @xmath24 sized lattices with periodic boundary conditions . in each case measurements at @xmath25@xmath26 different @xmath27 values were taken .",
    "following @xmath28 ",
    "@xmath29 relaxation lattice updates at each @xmath27 the concentration averages and r.m.s .",
    "values were determined .",
    "the exponent @xmath30 and @xmath31 were fitted together  using the weighted least squares error method  to the critical scaling formula @xmath32    since the concentration in the immediate neighborhood of the critical point has a relatively large statistical error  owing to the increased relaxation time ",
    "data points within the @xmath33 neighborhood of @xmath31 were discarded . in order to compensate this truncation of data we performed the fitting in several different neighborhoods of the @xmath31 .",
    "since we do nt know how the ( [ ordp ] ) scaling breaks down away from @xmath31 , we have checked this tendency of the fitting by varying @xmath34 of the used data points : @xmath35 .",
    "this kind of analysis enabled us to see how the critical exponent converged as @xmath36 and we were able to extrapolate for the true @xmath30 exponent in spite of the growing statistical errors in the vicinity of @xmath31 .",
    "the generally accepted 1 + 1 dimensional dp critical exponets are summarized in table [ dp ] .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows that the estimated critical exponent of the order parameter converges to the value @xmath37 , which is about the dp value determined by dickman and jensen by series expansion @xcite .",
    "the critical point and @xmath30 estimates ( given in table [ pcbeta ] ) were determined by linear weighted least - square fitting to the functions of @xmath34 .",
    "the results of the bbc @xcite ( @xmath21 ) model are the most uncertain , but still seem to extrapolate to the dp class value if @xmath38 .",
    "estimates based on fitting with less than @xmath39 data points should not be taken very seriously and are shown for information only .    as a tendency the transitions become more and more steep ( and @xmath40 ) as we increase the lower limit of the ca rule ( @xmath9 ) . for @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    "non - empty steady state exists in the deterministic , @xmath43 limit only .",
    "one can easily check that only a few oscillating structures can survive .",
    "there is a first order transition to the empty state if @xmath44 , which is quite rare among one dimensional ca . for @xmath45",
    "every cell dies out .    to verify our results further simulations and analytical calculations",
    "were carried out ; these are discussed in the subsequent sections .      in two dimensions for @xmath4",
    "the transition seems to be continuous and the estimates for the critical exponent converged to the @xmath5 dimensional dp class value : @xmath46 @xcite ( figure [ fig1]/d ) . for @xmath19 and @xmath47",
    "the transitions appear to be discontinuous , see figures [ fig2 ] . if formula ( 2 ) is fitted to the concentration data  as if continuous transitions were assumed  results in @xmath31-s with values lower than @xmath27 with non - zero densities .",
    "since it is not easy to prove first order transition by simulation , we applied the generalized mean - field method , which has already been found to be very useful for deciding the order of the transition at ca @xcite .",
    "the results of these calculations are also shown in figure [ fig2 ] and they are discussed in section [ sec : gmf ] .      finite - size scaling is shown to be applicable to continuous transition to an absorbing state of nonequilibrium systems @xcite . at the critical point the steady state density ( @xmath17 ) and the fluctuation @xmath48 scale with the system size as : @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the correlation length exponent in the space direction : @xmath52 simulations were done in one dimension for lattice sizes : @xmath53 with the corresponding timesteps : @xmath54 .",
    "averaging was performed on the surviving samples out of @xmath55 independent runs .",
    "the @xmath31 values are taken from the time - dependent mc calculations .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows that the @xmath17 and @xmath56 results fall nicely on a straight line on a log - log plot , but for @xmath4 the fitting resulted in : @xmath57 for @xmath19 : @xmath58 and for @xmath21 : @xmath59 which differ slightly from the dp class values @xcite : @xmath60    we have shown that the deviations come from systems with small sizes , similarly as for @xcite . by omitting points with sizes less than @xmath61 the results converge to the dp values ( see tables [ fss1_6 ] , [ fss2_6 ] , [ fss3_6 ] ) and we can see the emergence of a dp like behavior in the large @xmath62 limit .",
    "time - dependent monte carlo simulations ( tdmc ) have been shown to be an efficient method for locating critical points and estimating exponents for models with continuous transition to an absorbing state @xcite .",
    "the initial state of this simulation is the smallest a single live seed , that can survive at the center of the lattice .",
    "the evolution of the population is followed up to several thousands of lattice update steps and the following quantities are measured at each time step :    * survival probability @xmath63 * concentration @xmath64 * average mean square distance of spreading from the center @xmath65    the evolution runs are averaged over @xmath66 independent runs for each different value of @xmath27 in the vicinity of @xmath31 ( but for @xmath65 only over the surviving runs ) . at the critical point we expect these quantities to behave in accordance with the power law as @xmath67 , i.e. @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 we carried out simulations for the one - dimensional systems up to @xmath71 time steps with @xmath72 independent samples .",
    "the seed was a single @xmath73 for @xmath4 , a neighboring pair of @xmath73-s for @xmath19 , and a triplet for @xmath21 .",
    "we did not follow the evolution of @xmath65 . to estimate the critical exponents we determined the local slopes : @xmath74 \\over \\ln(m)}\\ ] ] @xmath75 \\over \\ln(m)}\\ ] ] using @xmath76 .",
    "figures [ fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] , [ fig6 ] show these quantities as functions of @xmath77 . in the case of power - law behavior",
    "we should see a straight line as @xmath78 , when @xmath79 .",
    "the off - critical curves should possess curvature .",
    "curves corresponding to @xmath80 should veer upward , curves with @xmath81 should veer down . the critical exponent should be read off as the interception of the critical ( straight ) curve with the ordinate axis .    it is emphasized that it is very difficult to get precise estimates on the critical data by visual inspection of the curves . while for @xmath21 the middle curve  which seems to be the nearest to the critical one ",
    "one can read off dp exponents , for @xmath82 one could conclude that we have non - dp values .",
    "the logarithmic @xmath64 and @xmath63 data were fitted by parabolas : @xmath83 @xmath84 at different @xmath27 values .",
    "estimations for @xmath31 are based on the conditions @xmath85 and @xmath86 ; the results are shown in table [ pcbeta ] .",
    "it should be noted , however that even though the difference is small ( @xmath87 ) the conditions @xmath85 and @xmath86 do not give exactly the same @xmath31 .",
    "also the estimates for the exponents are slightly off the dp class values .",
    "the errors must have statistical nature with finite size errors being excluded since the fronts of the populations  over the entire run  can not exceed the boundary of the lattice .    to get more precise exponents we used the general form  including corrections to scaling  of the local slopes @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a correction to the scaling exponent . as indicated in table [ pcbeta ]",
    "the exponents agree well with the dp class data .",
    "renormalization group methods for nonequilibrium systems have been successful when combined with mean - field approximation . at the critical point the scaling behavior of quantities calculated on small clusters of different sizes is exploited .",
    "one main branch of such calculations is the coherent anomaly method ( cam ) its application to these ca models will be discussed in section [ sec : cam ] .",
    "another important approach is the so - called mean - field renormalization group ( mfrg ) method , originally introduced by indekeu et al .",
    "@xcite for equilibrium systems .",
    "later it was shown that the method may also be applied to self - avoiding walk and percolation problems @xcite .",
    "the application to nonequilibrium systems was demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "although this method is not considered to be the most accurate , it is relatively simple and effective .",
    "developments to enhance its performance are under way @xcite . here",
    ", we utilize the approach for one - dimensional ca .",
    "first we set up mean - field equations for different sized block probabilities ( @xmath90 ) in the steady state . here the index @xmath91 denotes an @xmath92 block .",
    "however we do not use the bayesian extension trick as in the case of the generalized mean - field calculations , but take into account the external field with the average concentration ( @xmath17 ) : @xmath93 because in the vicinity of the second - order phase transition to the absorbing state @xmath16 , we expand and keep linear terms only in the equations .",
    "we express the probability of a site being occupied ( @xmath94 ) by calculating it in terms of different ( @xmath92 ) cluster sizes . for the @xmath4 model in the @xmath95 case",
    "the equations are : @xmath96 @xmath97 in view of this , the probability of a site being in state 1 is : @xmath98 expanding in factors of @xmath17 we get : @xmath99 for clusters of pairs ( @xmath100 ) the equations look like : @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 now , the probability of 1 after linearization is : @xmath105 at the critical point the scaling requires that the @xmath94 probability must scale like the external field : @xmath106 this condition enables one to combine the expressions for @xmath107 and @xmath108 and to get an estimate for the @xmath31 . comparing the @xmath95 and @xmath100 results we obtained @xmath109",
    ".    the exponent @xmath51 , which measures the critical behavior of the correlation length , can be obtained from the scaling of @xmath110 resulting from change of the length scale @xmath111 : @xmath112 for @xmath95 and @xmath100 clusters it is : @xmath113 .",
    "this is very far from the dp class @xmath114 value , but if calculations are done on larger clusters the results converge there .",
    "we were able to go up to @xmath115 clusters with the help of symbolic mathematica programming .",
    "table [ mfrg ] shows that there is a slow convergence of the @xmath31 and @xmath51 values . with increasing the cluster sizes we expect more accurate results .",
    "unfortunately we were not able to apply the method for @xmath116 models because the mean - field approximations predict first order transitions for small cluster sizes and thereafter no scaling is expected .",
    "the generalized mean - field approximation ( gmf ) introduced by @xcite has already been applied to describe phase transitions of different stochastic ca models @xcite with success .",
    "the phase structure and the tricritical point of the one - dimensional bbc model ( @xmath21 ) with site - exchange mixing has been explored with the help of gmf @xcite .",
    "the traditional mean - field approximation has been extended to handle clusters of sizes @xmath117 with the help of the bayesian extension .",
    "correlations of range @xmath118 at a given level of approximation ( @xmath92 ) are neglected and the convergence of the results is analysed by increasing @xmath92 ; the details of the technique are given in @xcite .",
    "the extension of the method to the two - dimensional ca model is straightforward . in this case",
    "the nearest- and next - nearest neighbor of the lattice point can contribute to the sum defined in ( 1 ) .",
    "taking into account the probability of a given distribution we used maximal overlap of the clusters . at three - point level",
    "the form of the cluster breaks the @xmath119 symmetry and prevents the configuration from being covered symmetrically . because of this the result of the equations depends on the way of covering the configuration . to avoid this uncertainty we restricted ourselves to symmetrical clusters ( @xmath120 1 , 2 , 4 ) .      in the case of the @xmath4 model",
    "the convergence of the approximations is monotonic .",
    "even the traditional ( @xmath95 ) mean - field approximation predicts continuous phase transition . by applying quadratic fitting to the @xmath121 results we got an extrapolation value of @xmath122 value , which agrees with the simulation result ( see table [ gmf1 ] ) . for @xmath116",
    "the low level approximations gave a discontinuous phase transition , but the gap sizes decrease with increasing @xmath92 and finally disappear at @xmath123 for @xmath19 , and at @xmath124 for @xmath21 .",
    "it is interesting that the convergence is non - monotonic for the @xmath21 case in contrast to what we expect for equilibrium systems .      as one expects in two dimensions the gmf approximation gives more precise results than in one dimension . for the @xmath125 level approximation",
    "the @xmath31 data differ from the simulations by a few per cent only . for the @xmath4 model",
    "all approximations predict a second order phase transition , whereas for @xmath116 cases the transitions are discontinuous ( see table [ gmf2 ] ) and the gap sizes increase with @xmath92 .",
    "we can expect that in the @xmath122 exact limit the transition remains first order in agreement with the stdmc simulations .",
    "the gmf approximations give slow convergence at the critical point since the correlation length there goes to infinity .",
    "therefore the accuracy of method breaks down in the immediate vicinity of @xmath31 . to obtain estimates for the critical exponents one needs to apply an extrapolation technique .",
    "this technique usually is based on finite size scaling theory .",
    "the mean - field renormalization technique is one such approach .",
    "the coherent anomaly method ( cam ) introduced by suzuki @xcite is based on the scaling relation that the solution for singular quantities at a given ( @xmath92 ) level of approximation ( @xmath126 ) in the vicinity of the critical point is the product of the classical singular behavior multiplied by an anomaly factor @xmath127 , which becomes extremely large as @xmath128 ( and @xmath129 ) : @xmath130 where @xmath27 is the control parameter and @xmath131 is the classical critical index .",
    "the divergence of this anomaly factor scales as @xmath132 thereby permitting the estimation of the true critical exponent @xmath133 , given a set of gmf approximation solutions .",
    "the method has been tested on a great number of solved and unsolved systems @xcite .",
    "the application to cellular automata was shown by @xcite .",
    "we followed the technique described there in the case of the present ca models .",
    "a new parametrization is used suggested by @xcite @xmath134 that has an invariance property : @xmath135 .",
    "we took into account a correction term to the anomaly scaling : @xmath136 the gmf calculation gave enough data to do the cam extrapolations for the one dimensional @xmath4 case ( table [ cam1 ] ) . in a similar way to the mfrg case for @xmath116 models the first order predictions of the low level gmf results excluded cam calculations .",
    "table [ cam2 ] shows that @xmath30 results are stable in contrast to neglecting points from the nonlinear fitting procedure by eq.([corr ] ) and indicating dp class behavior .",
    "a deatiled analysis for a family of totalistic , critical ca in one and two dimensions has been carried out in order to check the dp conjecture and to clarify the former contradictory simulation results of the bbc ( @xmath21 ) model .",
    "different critical exponents were determined by simple steady state , finite size scaling and time dependent simulations .",
    "the simulation results are more extensive than the previous ones and none of them seems to break the dp rule .",
    "rather they all give estimates for different critical exponents that are close to the dp universality values .",
    "we wish to emphasize that careful analysis is necessary for each kind of simulation to get unambiguous results .",
    "we have shown that the systematic calculation of gmf provides a reliable way to distinguish the order of phase transitions .",
    "mean - field renormalization group and coherent anomaly method extrapolations to gmf provided estimates for critical exponents .",
    "these results are again in accordance with the dp conjecture .",
