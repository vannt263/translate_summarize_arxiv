    "division multiplexing ( ofdm ) is a technique widely used in many digital communication systems such us digital television ( dtv ) , digital audio broadcasting ( dab ) , terrestrial digital video broadcasting ( dvb - t ) , digital suscriber line ( dsl ) broadband internet access , standards for wireless local area networks ( wlans ) , standards for wireless metropolitan area networks ( wmans ) , and 4 g mobile communications .",
    "it has many advantages such us high bit rate , strong immunity to multipath and high spectral efficiency . however , one of the most serious problems is the high peak - to - average power ratio ( papr ) of the transmitted ofdm signal , since this large peaks introduce a serious degradation in performance when the signal passes through a nonlinear high - power - amplifier ( hpa ) .",
    "the non - linearity of hap leads to in - band distortion which increases bit error rate ( ber ) , and out - of - band radiation , which causes adjacent channel interference .",
    "there are several proposals to deal with the papr problem in ofdm systems @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the different techniques can be classified into different groups according to their characteristics .",
    "the most general classification is : clipping techniques , coding techniques , the distortionless schemes with side information and distortionless techniques without side information .",
    "the simplest implementation method is clipping technique , which consists in to deliberately clip the ofdm signal before amplification @xcite .",
    "clipping can reduce papr but this is a nonlinear process and may cause both in - band and out - of - band interference while destroying the orthogonality among the subcarriers .",
    "then , coding techniques are found , which are introduced in @xcite .",
    "the key of those techniques is to select the codewords that minimize the papr . in the next group",
    "we have the techniques that cause no distortion and create no out - of - band radiation , but they may be require the transmission of the side information to the receiver . techniques that require the transmission of side information are for example partial transmit sequence ( pts ) , tone reservation ( tr ) , etc . on the other hand selected mapping ( slm ) , constellation extension or orthogonal pilot sequences ( ops )",
    "do not require the transmission of side information .",
    "in this paper we describe some relevant papr reduction techniques of the literature .",
    "therefore , the paper is organized as follows . section [ sec : signal - model ] briefly shows the ofdm signal model . in section [ sec : papr ] the papr problem of the ofdm system",
    "is presented .",
    "the clipping techniques are exposed in section [ sec : clip ] . in section [ sec : coding ] coding schemes are described .",
    "the analysis of the different distortionless techniques are addressed in section [ sec : dstless ] .",
    "simulation results are provided in section [ sec : resul ] .",
    "finally conclusions are drawn in section [ sec : viii ] .",
    "the ofdm signal is the sum of @xmath0 independent signals modulated onto subchannels of equal bandwidth , which can be efficiently implemented by an inverse discrete fourier transform ( idft ) operation , as illustrated in figure [ fig : ofdm - signal ] .",
    "we denote @xmath1 as the frequency - domain complex data sequence , consisting of the frequency - domain complex symbols over @xmath2th subcarrier , @xmath3 to be transmitted in the @xmath4th ofdm symbol",
    ". then the time - domain signal @xmath5 \\rbrace$ ] is given by :    @xmath6=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n } } \\sum^{n-1}_{k=0 } { s^{\\ell}(k ) e^{j \\frac{2\\pi}{n } kn } } \\ , , 0\\leq n < n - 1\\ ] ]    where @xmath2 and @xmath7 are the frequency and time indices respectively .",
    "for the convenience , we omit the use of superscript @xmath4 in the sequel .",
    "the frequency - domain data sequence @xmath8 are independent , identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random variables and due to the central limit theorem , a small percentage of output samples will take very large magnitudes .",
    "this results in the well - known papr problem of ofdm systems .    in general , the papr ( @xmath9 ) of the time - domain sequence @xmath10 \\rbrace$ ] is defined as the ratio between the maximum instantaneous power and its average power @xcite , that is :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 denotes expected value .    in the literature ,",
    "the most common way to evaluate the papr is to determine the probability that this papr exceeds a certain threshold @xmath13 .",
    "this is represented by the complementary cumulative distribution function ( ccdf ) , which is a random variable , as :    @xmath14",
    "the simplest papr reduction method consists basically in clipping the high parts of the signal amplitude that are outside the allowed region @xcite .",
    "if the ofdm symbol @xmath15 is clipped at a level @xmath16 , then the the clipped signal @xmath17 is :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the phase of @xmath15 .",
    "this technique is the simplest of implementation but it has the following drawbacks :    * clipping causes in - band distortion , which degrades the performance of the ber * clipping causes out - of - band radiation , resulting in adjacent interference .",
    "this can be reduced by filtering , and thus clipping and filtering ( cf ) operation is used in @xcite .",
    "when the signal passes through the low - pass filtering there is a peak power regrowth . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that the nyquist - rate clipping suffers from a much higher peak power regrowth compared to the clipping with oversampling .",
    "thus , the results suggest that for efficient reduction of the peak power , the ofdm should be sufficiently oversampled ( _ i.e. _ @xmath20 ) before clipping .",
    "* there is the possibility to use iterative cf @xcite , but it takes many iterations to reach a desired amplitude level @xmath16 .",
    "coding techniques consist in selecting the codewords that minimize or reduce the papr .",
    "initially the idea was introduced in @xcite .",
    "this scheme requires exhaustive computational load to search the best codewords and to store the large lookup tables for encoding and decoding , specially with large number of subcarriers .",
    "moreover , these techniques do not address the error correction problem . in @xcite , an optimum code set for achieving minimum papr",
    "is introduced and , moreover , to deal with the error correction it uses an additive offset .",
    "it enjoys the twin benefits of power control and error correction , but requires extensive calculation to find good codes and offsets .",
    "also , there are approaches in which the use of complementary block coding ( cbc ) was proposed to reduce the papr without the restriction of the frame size @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite reed - solomon ( rs )",
    "codes over the galois field are employed to create a number of candidates , from which the best are selected .",
    "considering the characteristics of those coding techniques , the main disadvantage of those coding methods is the good performance at the cost of coding rate , and a high computational load to search the adequate codewords .",
    "as an alternative to combat the papr problem , there are several techniques without distortion such us partial transmit sequences ( pts ) , selected mapping ( slm ) , tone reservation ( tr ) , orthogonal pilot sequences ( ops ) and constellation extension among other .",
    "those methods may require the transmission of side information to the receiver .",
    "in the next lines we dedicate to explain the several distortionless techniques put into two groups according to if they require or not the transmission of side information .",
    "many techniques require the transmission of side information to the receiver in order to the receiver can determine the type of processing that has been employed at the transmitter side .",
    "we introduced the more significant schemes .",
    "the pts technique was originally introduced in @xcite , which consists in that the frequency - domain input data block @xmath21 is subdivided into @xmath22 disjoint carrier subblocks , which are represented by the vectors @xmath23 .",
    "in general , for pts scheme , the known subblock partitioning methods can be classified into three categories @xcite : adjacent partition , interleaved partition and pseudorandom partition .",
    "then , the subblocks @xmath24 are transformed into @xmath22 time - domain partial transmit sequences :    @xmath25 = \\mbox{idft } \\lbrace{\\mathbf{s}}^{(v)}\\rbrace.\\ ] ]    these partial sequences are independently rotated by phase factors @xmath26 .",
    "the objective is to optimally combine the subblocks to obtain the time - domain ofdm signals with the lowest papr .",
    "@xmath27    therefore , there are two important issues that should be solved in pts technique : high computational complexity to reach optimal phase factors and the overhead of the phase factors as side information needed to be transmitted to the receiver for correct decoding .",
    "recently , some approaches have been proposed in order to reduce the complexity , such us @xcite , where an iterative pts ( ipts ) is presented .",
    "the performance of this scheme is not good although the ipts is very simple .",
    "the dual - layer phase sequencing ( dlps ) with different implementations also is proposed in @xcite .",
    "there are other techniques that have been introduced in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite where the authors propose to reduce the computational complexity of pts .",
    "for example , in @xcite is introduced the idea of the relationship between the weighting factors and the transmitted bit vectors .",
    "tr and ti are two efficient techniques to reduce the papr of ofdm signals and they are proposed in @xcite . in these schemes",
    "both transmitter and receiver reserve a subset of tones that are not used for data transmission to generate papr reduction signals .",
    "the objective of tr is to find the time - domain signal @xmath28 to be added to the original time - domain signal @xmath15 to reduce the papr .",
    "denoting @xmath29 as a frequency - domain vector for tone reservation , that added to the data input symbols @xmath30 , then the new time - domain signal after tone reservation processing is @xmath17 :    @xmath31    therefore , the main aim of the tr is to find out the proper @xmath28 to make the vector with lower papr . to find the value of @xmath32",
    ", we must solve a convex optimization problem that can easily be cast as a linear programming problem .",
    "similarly , ti also uses an additive correction @xmath32 @xcite , although the idea is to increase the constellation size so that each of the points in the original basic constellation can be mapped into several equivalent points in the expanded constellation . each symbol in a data block can be mapped into one of several equivalent constellation points .",
    "this method is called tone injection because substituting a point in the basic constellation for a new point in the larger constellation is equivalent to injecting an appropriate tone .",
    "the ti technique is more problematic than the tr scheme since the injected signal occupies the frequency band as the information bearing signals .",
    "moreover , the alternative constellation points in ti technique have an increased energy and the implementation complexity increases due to the computation of the optimal translation vector @xcite .      in the next lines of this subsection we expose several distortionless techniques , which do not require the transmission of side information to the receiver .      in this technique ,",
    "the transmitter generates a sufficiently large number of alternative ofdm signal sequences , all representing the same information as the original symbol .",
    "then each of these alternative input data sequences is made the idft operation and the one with the lowest papr is selected for transmission @xcite .",
    "each input data symbol @xmath30 is multiplied by @xmath33 different phase sequences , each of length @xmath0 , @xmath34 , resulting in @xmath33 modified data symbol . after applying slm to @xmath30 ,",
    "the time - domain signal @xmath35 becomes :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 .",
    "the original slm scheme has the next characteristics :    * information about the selected phase sequence should be transmitted to the receiver as side information . at the receiver , the reverse operation is performed to recover the original data symbol . however , in @xcite and @xcite an slm algorithm without explicit side information is proposed .",
    "* for implementation , the slm technique requires a bank of @xmath33 idft operations to generate a set of candidate transmission signals , and this requirement usually results in high computational complexity .",
    "there are some approaches attempting to decrease the complexity like @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "* this approach is applicable with all types of modulation and any number of subcarriers .",
    "* the amount of papr reduction for slm depends on the number of phase sequences @xmath33 and the design of the phase sequences .      in constellation extension techniques",
    "the key is to play intelligently with the outer constellation points , that are moved within the proper quater - plane as shown in figure [ fig : constellation ] , such that the papr is minimized .",
    "the main advantages of these techniques are enumerated next :    * the minimum distance of the constellation points is not affected and it consequently guarantees no ber degradation . * these methods do no require the transmission of side information to the receiver .",
    "* there is no data rate loss .",
    "nevertheless , constellation expansion schemes introduce an increase in the energy per symbol .    in @xcite active constellation extension ( ace )",
    "is presented , and in this method all symbols are expanded but its computational burden is high .",
    "more recent , a metric - based symbol predistortion scheme has been introduced in @xcite and @xcite . in this method , a metric , defined mathematically in ( [ eq : metrica ] ) ,",
    "is used to measure how much each frequency - domain symbol contributes to large peaks , and the frequency - domain symbols with the highest metric values are selected and predistorted with a constant scaling factor @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39    where , @xmath40 is a function which gives an appropriate measure of the phase angle between the output sample @xmath41 $ ] and the contribution of symbol @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the angle between the output sample and the contribution of the symbol , @xmath44 is a weighting function that gives more weight to the output samples with large magnitudes , @xmath45 is a selected parameter , and @xmath46 is a set of size @xmath47 whose elements are the indices of the output samples that are larger than a predetermined threshold value @xcite .",
    "then the @xmath48 symbols with greatest positive metrics are determined to be predistorted with the corresponding scaling factor @xmath49 .",
    "this metric - based algorithm saves energy ( since only a subset of symbols are amplitude predistorted ) and it avoids a high computational load with the use of a metric .",
    "however , the main drawback is that the size of the subset and the scaling factor are chosen from a group of values suggested by the authors after empirical search .      in coherent wireless ofdm systems ,",
    "pilot symbols are usually inserted in the 2d time - frequency grid to estimate the channel .",
    "ops technique is proposed in @xcite , which inserts the orthogonal pilot sequences in the input symbols that provides the lowest papr .    in a ofdm symbol with @xmath0 subcarriers ,",
    "a subset @xmath50 of subcarriers will carry pilot symbols and thus , the input data symbols @xmath51 are :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are pilot and data symbols respectively .    the transmitted time - domain symbol @xmath41=x[n]+p[n]$ ]",
    "can be separated into two parts , as :    @xmath55 = \\left\\ {       \\begin{array}{lcr }          x\\left[n\\right ] & = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\sum_{k\\notin\\upsilon}{x(k)e^{j \\frac{2\\pi}{n}kn } } \\\\",
    "p\\left[n\\right ] & = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\sum_{k\\in\\upsilon}{p(k)e^{j \\frac{2\\pi}{n}kn } }      \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    where @xmath56 $ ] and @xmath57 $ ] refer to the time - domain data and pilot signals , respectively .",
    "ops technique @xcite proposes the use of a predetermined set of @xmath58 orthogonal pilot sequences of length @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) in order to reduces complexity and avoids any side information since blind detection is possible at the receiver due to the orthogonality condition .",
    "the @xmath59 pilot symbols of each ofdm symbol can be collected in a @xmath61length sequence denoted as @xmath62 where , the @xmath2th element of this sequence is given by :    @xmath63}_k= \\left\\ {           \\begin{array}{lr }              p(k ) , & k \\in\\upsilon \\\\              0      & k \\notin\\upsilon          \\end{array }      \\right.\\ ] ]    as stated before , a set of @xmath58 pilot sequences are available so the alphabet of @xmath62 is @xmath64 .",
    "each pilot sequence of this finite set @xmath65 , @xmath66 contains the frequency - domain pilot symbols at pilot positions while zeros are inserted in the remaining ones .",
    "these pilots sequences are orthogonal so then the ortoghonality conditions is fulfilled    @xmath67    where @xmath68 denotes the inner product .    in particular , if the well - known walsh - hadamard sequences are employed where @xmath69 , then @xmath70 $ ] , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 $ ] denotes the kronecker delta function .",
    "simulations are presented by averaging over @xmath73 randomly ofdm symbols with quaternary phase - shift keying ( qpsk ) modulation .",
    "the performance of the several papr schemes is presented in terms of ccdf .",
    "figure [ fig : ccdf - ns ] illustrates the papr of an ofdm system before applying any papr reduction technique .",
    "we present the ccdf for a set of different values of @xmath74 subcarriers .",
    "the horizontal and vertical axis represent the threshold ( @xmath13 ) for the papr and the probability that the papr of a certain ofdm symbol exceeds a threshold , respectively .",
    "it is shown that the unmodified ofdm signal has a papr that exceeds 10.5 db at the probability @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",

    "ofdm is an attractive technique for digital communications systems due to its high bit rate , strong immunity to multipath and high spectral efficiency .",

    "<S> orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) is widely used in many digital communication systems due to its advantages such us high bit rate , strong immunity to multipath and high spectral efficiency but it suffers a high peak - to - average power ratio ( papr ) at the transmitted signal . </S>",
    "<S> it is very important to deal with papr reduction in ofdm systems to avoid signal degradation . </S>",
    "<S> currently , the papr problem is an active area of research and in this paper we present several techniques and that mathematically analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> moreover their advantages and disadvantages have been enumerated in order to provide the readers the actual situation of the papr problem .    </S>",
