    "there are a lot of many - body systems of different physical nature where the clustering of matter from smooth or almost smooth distributions of particles can occur ( see , for example , @xcite - @xcite ) .",
    "such a process typically proceeds in particle ensembles with long - range forces , such as gravity or electric interactions , when the clustering leads to the formation of stable spatially inhomogeneous structures @xcite - @xcite .",
    "these processes define the system s dynamics and existence . for example",
    ", the pancake and adhesion models predict the persistence of a density peak at the flow caustics which appears from the initial distributions having gaussian initial fluctuations and is due to the development of the gravitational instability @xcite . in this case",
    "the singular behavior makes it impossible to reverse the process through the destruction of such structures .",
    "one may say that singularities are the factor which stabilizes the space structures .",
    "the formation of singularities is a necessary condition for the implementation of these clustering mechanism ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite - @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that a similar behavior can be expected for ideal and/or dissipative plasmas .",
    "an example is the generation of a fast ion peak in the plasma expansion problem which is caused by the density collapse of the ion fluid for negligible dissipation becoming a stabilized fast ion peak at the front edge of the expanding plasma , when dissipation is included @xcite .",
    "considering the analogy between gravitational and electrostatic fields , it may seem that such nonlinear dynamics is realized in the case of the coulomb interaction too . however , in the coulomb systems or the force - free systems there exists another possibility for structure formation without a singular ( blow - up ) behavior .",
    "the dynamics for some initial conditions can lead to the formation of dynamical space structures @xcite in which the initial conditions play the role of a driving parameter precluding the formation of singularities but providing the formation of transient dynamical structures .",
    "the present paper considers some aspects of such a transient clustering mechanism in one - dimensional geometry which , of course , looks like somewhat artificial since all real systems , as a rule , are not one - dimensional ones , in higher spatial dimensions , a large variety of nonlinear dynamical structures can be expected ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "nonetheless , this model indicates what may come about in real systems . in the case worked out there are no stabilizing factors such as dissipative processes or formation of caustics .",
    "so one can expect that the structure emerged may break down or simply disappear .",
    "it means that some smooth initial density distributions will produce a wave - like structure which over time will emerge and subsequently disappear yielding a distribution becoming close to the initial distribution .",
    "we shall consider such a possibility and we try to define the conditions for which such an evolution of the one - dimensional system may be realized .",
    "here , we consider two types of one - dimensional , time - dependent patterns of infinite , compressible medium .",
    "first type is the medium containing only movable , particles which interact with each other via self - consistent gravitational ( or coulomb ) fields .",
    "another type of the medium is a cold plasma containing movable electrons and immobile ions of constant density @xmath0 . in both media ,",
    "the structure formation comes about because of the self - consistent forces caused by the distribution of the movable particles within the system and the effect of initial conditions .",
    "the dynamics of these systems is governed by the euler - poisson hydrodynamic equations written in dimensionless variables as @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the density of movable component and @xmath5 the velocity of the fluid .",
    "the self - consistent potential @xmath6 corresponds for constant @xmath7 to an attractive force and for @xmath8 to a repulsive force in the system , whereas the case @xmath9 describes an ordinary flow without potential forces . in our model",
    "the constant @xmath10 can take two values : @xmath11 for the case of zero background describing one component flow with pure gravitational or coulomb interaction and @xmath12 for a nonzero background describing the evolution of cold plasma medium .",
    "it is also worth noting that though the euler - poisson system appears in numerous applications including plasma physics and astrophysical applications there is a sense to consider it as an inviscid limit of burges turbulence model @xcite in the systems with collective interaction . from such point of view",
    "the influence of initial conditions on the regular and chaotic structures formation has been of great interest .    in order to study this effect",
    "we consider an initial - value problem for the equations ( [ 1_nature])([3_nature ] ) in the infinite interval @xmath13 .",
    "( this allows us to avoid the influence of boundary conditions and finite size of the interval on the dynamics . )",
    "presuming that the initial velocity profile of movable particles is specified by the dependence @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the arbitrary positive constants .",
    "@xmath17 will be smooth and monotonic and we assume that the sign of the velocity derivative , @xmath18 , is retained .",
    "second term in ( [ 4_nature ] ) describes some regular perturbation in the initial conditions .",
    "the initial density profile of the movable component is assumed to be an even function @xmath19 which preserves a finite mass in the interval @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath20 moreover , we must supplement the above - given relations by the following conditions , arising from the symmetry of the problem at @xmath21 : @xmath22    now we transform the original system ( [ 1_nature])([3_nature ] ) to a simpler form . using the definition @xmath23 and condition ( [ symmetry_nature ] ) ,",
    "we can conveniently cast ( [ 1_nature])([3_nature ] ) into the form @xmath24",
    "the study of the system ( [ 6_col])([7_col ] ) is conveniently carried out in the lagrangian variables ( see , for example , @xcite ) : @xmath26 where @xmath27 satisfies the initial condition @xmath28 and provides @xmath29 this transformation holds true when the jacobian ( see , for example , @xcite ) @xmath30 besides , the condition of sign conservation of @xmath31 eliminates singularities of the flow .",

    "differentiating the relation ( [ 4_col ] ) with respect to @xmath37 , switching thereby to the mass variable @xmath38 as a lagrangian variable instead of @xmath37 ( see , for example , @xcite ) , we get @xmath39 where we define the quantity @xmath40 as the specific volume ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , after differentiating ( [ 5_col ] ) with respect to @xmath41 and bearing in mind ( [ u_nature ] ) we find @xmath42 relations ( [ 10_col ] ) and ( [ 12_col ] ) can be used to obtain a wave equation for the specific volume @xmath43 instead of the system ( [ 1_nature])([3_nature ] ) . differentiating the relation ( [ 10_col ] ) with respect to @xmath38 and taking into account ( [ 12_col ] ) , we obtain @xmath44 which should be supplemented by the initial conditions : @xmath45 @xmath46^{-1}{\\partial u \\over",

    "depending on the parameter @xmath10 , the equation ( [ 13_col ] ) has got different solutions which describe different physical situations .",
    "indeed , in the case @xmath11 when in the system there is only a gravitational or electrostatic interaction , the general solution of the problem ( [ 13_col])-([dv0 ] ) is then finally provided by @xmath47^{-1}\\/ \\equiv { n_0(\\xi ) \\over j(\\xi,\\tau)}. \\label{cold_col}\\ ] ] we mention that the expression for @xmath48 can also be directly obtained from the solutions of eqs .",

    "in the framework of initial - value problem , the initial velocity perturbations of special kind ( @xmath65 ) in spatially homogeneous plasma ( @xmath66 ) have been discussed by kalman @xcite .",
    "as was established , this process can lead to the formation of standing density waves whose form is determined by the form of the initial velocity profile .",
    "now based on the relations ( [ cold_col])-([u_sh ] ) and ( [ d_dav])-([udav ] ) , we show that for @xmath67 and @xmath68 it is possible the formation of density structures differing from the above - described variants .",

    "therefore , all the information on the characteristics of the density distribution is contained in ( [ cold_col ] ) and ( [ d_dav ] ) or in theirs derivatives @xmath73 .",

    "@xmath97 however , the manifestation of @xmath95 in @xmath98 completely depends on the magnitude and sign of the function @xmath99 . thus , the possible way of evolution for the system is determined by the relation between the functions @xmath99 and @xmath95 .",
    "in @xcite we applied such approach to study the formation of wavelet structures under the influence of the perturbative part of the initial velocity distribution when the function @xmath89 can have both negative and positive values . here",

    "this regime is of interest since it admits both clustering and dissolution of the pattern arising from smooth initial distributions .",

    "an explicit example in the 3d parameter space @xmath127 for which ( [ 9_n0a ] ) is valid is given by @xmath128 .",

    "in this situation the formation of wavelet structure on the density profile in the course of time occurs similar to the case studied in @xcite for small times when the initial smooth and monotonic distribution ( [ 10_n0a ] ) is transformed into density profile with a large number of local extrema as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] for @xmath131 .",
    "such script scenario will be implemented until the eq .",

    "( [ 7_nature ] ) has no real root anymore and the wavelet structure of density dependence is transformed into a distribution which is similar to the initial distribution .",
    "thus , for the given initial conditions the wavelet structure can exist only for some finite time .",
    "the physical reason for this unexpected behavior may be found in the temporal change of the strength of the nonlinearity , which gives rise to a steepening and structure formation in the earlier stage when it is strong , but later , when it becomes weakened by the expansion process , it is no longer in the position to sustain the structure , which then dissolves .    in the case presented in figs .",
    "[ fig_1 ] and [ fig_2 ] such a structure exists only in the interval @xmath135 . for times",
    "@xmath136 the process may be again repeated in general . however , it is impossible to replicate this scenario identically since the new velocity distribution will differ from the initial distribution @xmath137 .",
    "this property distinguishes the cases @xmath108 from the case @xmath107 in which the formation of singularities eliminates such behavior . in this connection , let us dwell on the time reversibility of the system ( [ 1_nature])([3_nature ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the eqs .",

    "this leads only to @xmath142 .",
    "it means that ( [ 1_nature])([3_nature ] ) is a reversible system and generally we can expect to get the initial space distribution of density and velocity ; at least such a possibility is not prohibited .",
    "however , as was shown above , in the present case the destruction of space structure is caused by other reasons . though the same result follows directly from eq.([13_col ] ) , here we use the euler frame as physically more intuitive one .",
    "now we pass to the plasma structures formation by considering the vlasov - poisson system with parameters @xmath55 and @xmath12 . following to @xcite we put @xmath143 then eq . ( [ d_nature ] )",

    "assume that @xmath147 as this was done in @xcite . from ( [ d_nature ] ) it easy to see that in this case there are no conditions for the development of the wave breaking .",

    "namely there is an accumulation of particles in the regions where @xmath150 and there is a diminishing density in the regions @xmath151 .",
    "also , at the time moments @xmath152 we have @xmath153 this type of exteremum is perfectly caused by the electrostatic electron oscillations of a plasma medium .",
    "we now get an oscillatory time behavior with repeated sign reversals of @xmath154 .",
    "the temporal evolution is no longer an uni - directional expansion with increasing out - flow velocities , as in the previous cases , but it is now characterized by a time - periodic behavior , where out- and in - flows alternate each other .",
    "this is physically expected since in the presence of an ion background the force influencing on the electrons changes periodically its direction .",

    "<S> the lagrangian fluid description is employed to solve the initial value problem for one - dimensional , compressible fluid flows represented by the euler - poisson system . </S>",
    "<S> exact nonlinear and time - dependent solutions are obtained , which exhibit a variety of transient phenomena such as a density collapse in finite space - time or the appearance and , for the first time , a successive dissolution of wavelet structures during the same event . </S>",
    "<S> the latter are superimposed on the gross density pattern in the course of the uni - directional expansion of an initially localized density hump . </S>",
    "<S> whereas self - gravitating fluids will always experience collapse , neutral fluids and fluids with repulsive forces , such as a non - neutral , pure electron fluid , can exhibit an evolution of the second type , being determined by the initial conditions . for an electron fluid , </S>",
    "<S> being embedded in a neutralizing ion background , these nonlinearities are , however , strongly diminished due to the omnipresent plasma oscillations , which weaken and alternatively change the sign of the collective force . + </S>"
