    "metastability in a stochastic process is described by rare , noise - induced dynamical events .",
    "for example , a brownian particle in a double well potential , where the fluctuations are weak compared to the force of the potential , occationally jumps back and forth between each well .",
    "metastability is of particular interest in gene regulation circuits because rare extreme shifts in the expression of a gene can have a profound effect on the behavior of a cell @xcite .",
    "the challenge for stochastic modeling is to elucidate possible metastable events and quantify the timescale on which those events are likely to occur .",
    "quantitative theoretical models can distinguish between events that may realistically occur on the timescale of cell division and those that occur on longer timescales .",
    "understanding the relative stability of metastable states in an artificial gene expression circuit is relevant in synthetic biology .",
    "because metastable events are by definition rare , an analysis based on direct simulation is computationally impractical . in this paper , we derive an asymptotic approximation using perturbation theory .",
    "one of the most difficult aspects of applying standard stochastic techniques to study gene regulation is accounting for reactions involving the gene .",
    "regulatory molecules , activators and repressors , bind to regulatory segments of dna and interact with the gene promotor to affect the transcription rate ( synthesis of mrna ) .",
    "there can be as few as one active copy of the gene in a given cell .",
    "the case of linear feedback regulation is analytically tractable and many exact results are available @xcite .",
    "however , for the general case of nonlinear regulation , approximation methods are necessary .",
    "metastable behavior necessarily occurs under weak noise conditions , where fluctuations , whatever their source , are weak compared to deterministic forces .",
    "a stochastic description of a given chemical reaction converges to deterministic mass action kinetics in the large system size limit where the number of molecules is large ; this limit is sometime referred to as the large @xmath0 limit , where @xmath0 is the characteristic number of molecules .",
    "hence , it is natural to consider weak noise conditions for a stochastic chemical reaction to occur when @xmath0 is large but finite .",
    "this is precisely the limit in which the chemical master equation is approximated by the chemical fokker - planck equation .",
    "clearly , no such limit is possible for a reaction involving a species having a single member .",
    "however , if the reaction involving the gene is fast , one can obtain a deterministic description by taking an adiabatic limit , where the gene is described as switching between its various states infinitely fast so that it obtains an averaged transcription rate . for example , a gene that switches between on and off states would , in the adiabatic limit , have an effective transcription rate scaled by the fraction of time spent in the on state . a stochastic gene regulation model",
    "can then be said to be under weak noise conditions when it switches between its different states fast but not infinitely fast .",
    "one could argue that mrna should also be regarded as an adiabatic species . in most situations",
    "mrna copy number is quite low . while mrna are expensive to synthesize , a single copy is capable of producing many proteins .",
    "if a gene expression model displays metastable behavior ( i.e. , weak noise conditions ) and mrna is present in small numbers , then it follows that the mrna transcription and degradation must be fast ( on the same time scale as promotor switching ) .",
    "methods for approximating mean switching times are well known in the applied math literature for continuous markov processes described by a fokker ",
    "planck equation @xcite . the rigorous mathematical basis of this theory is known as _ large deviation theory _ @xcite . the theory used to describe",
    "metastable behavior for chemical systems generally considers large-@xmath0-type weak noise conditions @xcite .",
    "the bistable switch has been analyzed using a variety of means to eliminate promotor switching from the problem , by using a diffusion approximation @xcite , by taking the adiabatic limit @xcite , or by assuming that mrna is synthesized in bursts @xcite .",
    "however , the first two approaches result in quantitatively inaccurate estimates for the mean switching times @xcite , and the latter is only applicable when the mrna degradation rate is large compared to the transcription rate and the promotor transition rates .",
    "the first to make progress on developing a general asymptotic approximation , assaf and coworkers obtained a partial description of bistable switching in a three - species stochastic model ( promotor , mrna , and protein ) @xcite .",
    "the result was significant because their model explicitly included mrna copy number and stochastic `` on - off '' promotor switching .",
    "however , their result does not account for more than two promotor states , and they assumed that mrna are present in sufficient numbers that it can be treated as a continuous quantity .",
    "additionally , they derived a logarithmically - accurate asymptotic estimate of the mean switching times , lacking a pre exponential factor ( pef ) .",
    "methods for computing the pef are well developed for the fokker ",
    "planck equation @xcite , but they have not been widely applied to chemical systems .",
    "we argue that a different approach is necessary to solve the problem , one that applies to chemical systems where weak noise arises from species that can be either `` large @xmath0 '' or `` adiabatic '' . using theory first developed to study metastability in a molecular motor model with an adiabatic motor configuration @xcite",
    ", the authors later derived an approximation to the gene expression problem that accounts for an arbitrary number of promotor states @xcite and a mean switching time approximation that included the pef , but did not explicitly include mrna .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a complete description of bistable switching in a simple gene regulation circuit that includes promotor switching , a discrete mrna reaction , and a protein concentration that regulates the promotor switching rates .",
    "our main assumption is that all of the transition rates ( the promotor switching rates , the mrna transcription and degradation rates , and the protein synthesis rate ) are large compared to the protein degradation rate .",
    "physically , this assumption is valid in a given system if ( i ) protein is present in sufficient quantity that it can be regarded as a concentration , ( ii ) mrna is present in small number , and ( iii ) intrinsic noise weakly affects the protein concentration .    using a recently developed quasi - stationary analysis ( qsa ) @xcite",
    ", we obtain a arrhenius  eyring  kramers rate that includes the previously unknown pef .",
    "our result agrees with the logarithmically accurate approximation reported in @xcite under a less restrictive set of assumptions ( we make no assumption about the rate of transcription compared to the rate of mrna degradation ) . in addition to the kramers rate , the pef allows us to derive a uniformly accurate asymptotic approximation of the joint stationary probability distribution , including the discrete conditional distribution of mrna .",
    "the theory is independent of the particular choice of protein dependent promotor switching rates .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we introduce the model in section [ sec : model ] , along with the deterministic limit . in section [ sec : quasi - stat - appr ] we introduce the qsa and the approximation formula for mean switching times .",
    "the wkb approximation of the stationary probability density function is calculated in section [ sec : wkb ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : results ] we compare our results with monte - carlo simulations ( obtained using the standard gillespie algorithm ) for a simple example of positive feedback regulation .",
    "let @xmath1 represent the gene state with @xmath2 when the gene is on and @xmath3 when it is off .",
    "when the gene is on , mrna @xmath4 is transcribed at a rate @xmath5 , and each mrna is removed at a constant rate @xmath6 .",

    "each mrna synthesizes protein @xmath8 at a rate @xmath9 and each protein molecule is removed at a rate @xmath10 .",
