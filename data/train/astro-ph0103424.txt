    "recent developments in the blazar field , mainly stimulated by the discovery that these sources are strong @xmath0ray emitters , are offering new and important clues for understanding relativistic jets .",
    "all blazar spectral energy distributions ( sed ) are characterized by two broad emission peaks e.g. @xcite , strongly variable on different timescales ( wagner & witzel 1995 ; maraschi et al .",
    "1994 ; hartman et al .",
    "the location of these peaks ( their frequency , relative and absolute flux ) and their variability behavior are a strong diagnostic tools to discriminate among theoretical models and find the intrinsic physical parameters of the source . the broad band spectrum from the far infrared upwards can be explained by a  single - zone \" model , where the two peaks are respectively due to synchrotron and inverse compton scattering from the same relativistic electron population ( maraschi , ghisellini & celotti 1992 ; sikora , begelman & rees 1994 ) . since the radiative cooling time is much shorter than the dynamical one , the emitting particles must be accelerated _ in situ _ all along the jet , by means of a process not yet univocally determined .",
    "the high energy flux varies generally on a timescale of the order of a day , and the bulk lorentz factor ( blf ) @xmath1 of the jet is estimated around @xmath2 @xcite , leading to an upper limit for the source dimension of the order of @xmath3 cm .",
    "furthermore , the required transparency for @xmath0rays to the process of photon ",
    "photon pair production , sets a lower limit in the most powerful sources , of order @xmath4 cm , to the typical distance where the bulk of the radiative dissipation occurs .",
    "blazars are also characterized by strong radio emission , with a flat spectrum [ @xmath5 , with @xmath6 between @xmath7 and @xmath8 and variability time scales of the order of weeks , months ( see e.g. ulrich , maraschi & urry , 1997 ) .",
    "while the emission at frequencies from the far infrared upwards can be consistently due to a single population of electrons in the inner parts of the jet , the emission in the radio band has to be generated  in order not to be self ",
    "absorbed  on the outer , parsec scales where the plasma properties are expected to be different .",
    "the bulk motion is still relativistic at such distances , with blfs similar to those inferred on the sub ",
    "parsec scales , @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the existing models , both homogeneous ( e.g. sikora , begelman & rees 1994 ; inoue & takahara 1996 ) and inhomogeneous ones ( e.g. celotti , maraschi & treves 1991 ; ghisellini & maraschi 1989 ) , estimate the jet plasma properties , the magnetic field @xmath10 and the random lorentz factors ( rlf ) of the electrons emitting at the peak of the spectra , @xmath11 , by fitting the observed sed . in the inner jet",
    "@xmath12 g and @xmath11 varies from @xmath13 10@xmath14 to 10@xmath15 depending on the power of the source @xcite : for the powerful ovv quasars  with bolometric luminosity of the order of @xmath16 erg s@xmath17 ",
    "the synchrotron peak is at infrared - optical frequencies and @xmath18 is estimated around 10@xmath19 , while for the less powerful sources , like the weak bl lacs  with @xmath20erg s@xmath17  the synchrotron emission peaks in the uv  x - ray range and the rlfs of the electrons must be higher , @xmath21 10@xmath22 .",
    "this trend of decreasing peak energy with increasing source power appears to be systematic and can be accounted for by a corresponding increase in the intensity of a photon field external to the jet , which enhances the inverse compton cooling losses ( fossati et al . 1998",
    "; ghisellini et al .",
    "1998 ) . in the parsec scale jet",
    "the observed ( radio ) emission is believed to be synchrotron and the corresponding magnetic field and electrons rlf are estimated to be @xmath23 g and @xmath24 , leading to particle cooling timescales much longer than the dynamical one .    although these studies have allowed us to consistently derive the physical parameters in the emitting region , many aspects in the understanding of relativistic jets remain open , most notably the jet energetics and particle acceleration . in order to explore these issues and their relationship",
    "we consider a scenario where the plasma characteristics are not treated as free parameters , but are the result of the jet dynamics , thus relating the observed emission properties to the transport of energy along the jet .",
    "we achieve that by _ quantitatively _ considering a general scenario for the interpretation of blazars analogous to the standard scenario proposed to explain gamma ",
    "ray bursts , which was actually originally proposed for blazars more than two decades ago ( rees 1978 ) .",
    "the most important assumption in this scenario is that the central power engine produces energy which is channeled into jets in an intermittent way , though such a time dependent process can not be easily inferred from first principles .",
    "if the physical conditions determining the energy deposition are not steady , the distribution of blfs and masses is non - uniform within the ejecta : faster portions of the flow would then catch up with slower ones leading to the development of relativistic shocks .",
    "the shocks would plausibly heat the expanding ejecta , generate / amplify a tangled magnetic field and accelerate leptons to relativistic energies , in turn causing synchrotron and inverse compton emission . in this scenario  named internal shock model ( e.g. rees & meszaros 1994 ; lazzati , ghisellini & celotti 1999 , panaitescu , spada & meszaros 1999 )  the following observational characteristics can be naturally explained :    * * efficiency  * the radiative output of radio sources in general , and blazars in particular , has to be a small fraction of the energy transported by the jet ( less than 10% ) : extended radio structures require in fact a power input exceeding what is emitted ( e.g. rawlings & saunders 1991 ; celotti & fabian 1993 ) .",
    "low efficiency is indeed a characteristic of the internal shock model , as the range of the blfs of the colliding shells can be only small ( say the ratio of the maximum and minimum ones @xmath25 ) in order to have a resulting jet bulk motion on larger scale with @xmath26 . * * minimum distance for dissipation  * as mentioned in the introduction , there is a minimum dimension for the @xmath0-ray source and the bulk of the observed power must be produced at some distance from the jet apex , i.e. from the accretion disk .",
    "in other words , the emitting zone must be far away from @xmath27-rays sources and not extremely compact itself otherwise , quite inevitably , the high energy @xmath0rays are absorbed by the dense radiation fields .",
    "the electron ",
    "positron pairs generated by such photon ",
    "photon interaction would then re - process the @xmath0ray power into softer ( especially x  ray ) radiation , which is not observed ( ghisellini & madau 1996 ) .",
    "in the internal shock model the jet becomes radiative on scales much larger than the central source dimension ( @xmath28 cm for a black hole of @xmath29 ) since all the velocities are close to @xmath30 and therefore the shells propagate for a significant distance before collisions can start .",
    "the expected minimum distance for the @xmath0-rays emission is of the order of @xmath31 cm , where @xmath32 measures the time interval between two consecutive shell ejections .",
    "* * variability  * clearly the observed large amplitude variability must be explained by a non steady  state model : we believe that the shell  shell collision scenario studied here is the simplest among them . *",
    "* continuous energy deposition along the jet  * dissipation is observed to occur along the whole jet , from the inner to the parsec scales with decreasing luminosity and typical photon frequency",
    ". the dynamical evolution of a wind in the internal shock model can indeed reproduce such behavior : shell  shell collisions take place along the whole jet , leading to a continuous conversion of bulk energy into internal one over a large range of distances . due to the averaging of the shell blfs during the expansion , the collisions become progressively less efficient as the distance increases , thus progressively reducing the released internal energy , the electron rlf , and the magnetic field .    as this scenario allows to predict a general and fairly complete description of the _ entire _ radiative jet",
    ", we believe that it can be a powerful tool to understand blazar spectra , their variability and the possible correlations between observed quantities on different scales . while we plan to fully explore the large potentialities of this model in a forthcoming work , in this paper we present the basic assumptions and the general set up of the model . for illustration purposes ( i.e. not aiming to determine precise values of the physical quantities ) we also consider the case of a specific well studied blazar , specifically 3c 279 .",
    "section 2 therefore describes the dynamics of the wind and the shocks forming from shell collisions , while in section 3 the radiative properties of the shocked plasma are presented .",
    "the numerical simulations for the time dependent evolution of the system are described in section 4 , while the results and the specific case of 3c 279 are the subject of section 5 . in the final section 6",
    "we discuss our findings .",
    "the entire jet emission is simulated by adding pulses radiated in a series of internal shocks that occur in a unstable relativistic wind ( daigne & mochkovitch 1998 ; spada , panaitescu & meszaros 2000 ) .",
    "after ( parametrically ) setting the dynamics of the wind ejection , we calculate the radii where the shells collide . for each collision",
    "we study the hydrodynamics , in order to determine the shock velocity , the compression ratio and the internal energy @xmath33 of the shocked fluid . assuming a given partition of @xmath33 among protons , electrons and magnetic field we calculate the relevant physical parameters in the shocked fluid , and finally the features of the emitted radiation .",
    "the wind is discretized as a sequence of @xmath34 shells , where @xmath35 is the duration time of the wind ejection from the central source and @xmath36 is the average interval between consecutive ejections .",
    "each shell is characterized by a mass @xmath37 , a bulk lorenz factor @xmath38 and an ejection time @xmath39 : at @xmath40 the j - th shell is at a distance @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the central source dimension ( @xmath43 cm ) .",
    "the shell blfs @xmath38 are chosen randomly from a uniform distribution between @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and the shell masses are also randomly picked up from a uniform distribution with an average value @xmath46 , where the total mass in the wind @xmath47 is determined by the requirement : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the wind luminosity .",
    "the time interval between the ejection of a couple of consecutive shells is assumed to mimic a scenario in which the inner engine behaves as an accumulation mechanism : the quiescent time between the ejection of the @xmath50 and the @xmath51 shells is proportional to the total energy in the @xmath51 shell .",
    "the ejected shell width @xmath52 is of the same order of the central source dimension @xmath42 and the shell internal energy @xmath53 is negligible ( all the energy is stored as bulk kinetic energy ) .",
    "the dynamics of the wind expansion is characterized by a series of two - shell collisions in which the faster shells catch up with the slower ones in the outer parts of the ejecta .",
    "the calculation of the collision radii follows the procedure of kobayashi , piran & sari ( 1998 ) .",
    "given the wind configuration after the @xmath54-th collision , i.e. shell radius @xmath55 , shell velocity @xmath56 , shell width @xmath57 and expansion velocity of the shell @xmath58 , we calculate the minimum value among all the collision times between pairs of shells ( @xmath59 ) with @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 @xmath62 the radius of the @xmath63-th collision represents the position of the two shells colliding after @xmath64 .",
    "this procedure is iterated for a wind described by an up - dated configuration , with a merged shell instead of the two colliding ones .    regarding the two - shell interaction as an inelastic collision , the momentum and energy conservation laws yield the physical properties of the merged shell .",
    "if ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) and ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) are the blfs , rest masses and internal energies of the fast ( inner ) and slow ( outer ) shell with @xmath71 , the merged shell has a rest mass @xmath72 , a blf given by : @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the total internal energy of the merged shell will then be : @xmath76 the dynamical efficiency , namely the newly generated internal energy over the total energy , is given by : @xmath77 this efficiency decreases with the ratio @xmath78 and is maximized for @xmath79 .",
    "the width of the shells spreads between two consecutive collisions with a velocity : @xmath80 as measured in the observer s frame , where @xmath81 is the sound velocity of the plasma in the shell co  moving frame : @xmath82 during the free expansion between two subsequent collisions , each shell loses internal energy for adiabatic losses , while the blf is held constant . the magnetic field , on the contrary ,",
    "is generated at each collision without keeping memory of the field generated in precedent collisions ( if any ) .",
    "the plasma thermal energy @xmath83 increases in each collision  by the fraction of @xmath84 which is not used to either accelerate electrons to a power  law energy distribution and/or generate / amplify magnetic field  leading to an increase in the plasma sound velocity @xmath85 during the wind expansion .",
    "since during each collision the propagation of the shocks through the two shells compresses the width of the merged shell @xmath86 , the calculation of @xmath86 itself requires a hydrodynamic treatment of the interaction , that is presented in the next section .",
    "let us consider the dynamics of the interaction between two shells . here",
    "it will be assumed that the presence any magnetic field is negligible from the dynamics point of view . during the collision two shocks",
    "are formed , separated by a contact discontinuity : a forward shock ( fs ) that propagates in the external slow shell and a reverse shock ( rs ) that propagates backward in the faster shell ( see figure [ fig : shock ] ) .",
    "the calculation of the shocked plasma blf , @xmath87 , in the lab frame can be done applying the following conditions @xcite :    * the blandford  mckee ( 1976 ) jump equations for the fs and rs . for the fs",

[ eq : ein ] ) . * knowing the shell width and the shock velocity we can then estimate the shell crossing time of the shock @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the post - shock and pre - shock material velocity , respectively .",

    "is then defined by @xmath120 : @xmath121 and is assumed to be randomly oriented in space .    following the results on non - relativistic shocks , and the recent results on relativistic ones ( bednarz & ostrowski 1998 ; kirk et al .",

    "having estimated such quantities , we can therefore calculate the spectrum of the radiation emitted during each collision . in order to achieve that we adopt some simplifications :    *",
    "the emitting zone is assumed to be homogeneous , and the plasma is embedded in a tangled magnetic field .",
    "its comoving volume is @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the half - opening angle of the jet , assumed conical . *",
    "the relativistic particles are treated as having the same energy distribution throughout the entire emitting region . in a more realistic approach",
    ", the particles would be accelerated at the shock front , where most of the energetic electrons would be located , while cooled particles would be progressively more distant from the shock front .",
    "however , as we are interested in the ",
    "average \" spectrum , we assume to collect radiation emitted by the entire shell . clearly such simplification does not allow to consider changes in spectral details occurring on a timescale faster than the light crossing time of a single shell . * there is a source of soft photons external to the jet .",

    "the emitting plasma is moving at a blf @xmath1 , intermediate between the original blf of the two colliding shells , computed according to the details given in section 2 .",
    "the radiation produced by each colliding shell is then received by the observer as @xmath188 where @xmath189^{-1}$ ] is the doppler ( or beaming ) factor and @xmath190 is the viewing angle ( with respect to the jet axis ) .",

    "in this section we analyze the general properties of the macro and micro  physics of the plasma during the jet evolution . numerical simulations",
    "are mandatory in order to test the model , given the difficulty in understanding and disentangle the effect of each parameter on the global properties of the flow and the produced radiation .",
    "the number of parameters that sets the kinematical and radiative evolution of the jet flow is relatively small .",
    "more precisely , the range of blfs ( @xmath191 ) , the average kinetic luminosity of the inner engine @xmath49 and the time variability timescale @xmath192 define the kinematical evolution , while the equipartition parameters @xmath116 and @xmath115 and the fraction of accelerated electrons @xmath126 control the radiative properties of the plasma .",

    "let us consider , as an example , the effect of variations ( decrease ) in the lower blf @xmath44 .",
    "on one side as the average speed of the shells is smaller , they must be more massive to maintain the same wind luminosity .",
    "this implies that the energy per baryon generated in each collision is lower and thus a smaller @xmath128 is expected . on the contrary",
    ", the dynamical efficiency increases thanks to the larger ratios of the blfs of the involved shells , leading in turn to larger internal energy , in direct competition with the former effect .",
    "moreover , a smaller @xmath44 causes the collisions to start earlier , when the shell volume is smaller , with the consequent creation / amplification of a larger magnetic field . in summary ,",
    "even a limited change in a single parameter causes several ( often competing ) effects in the kinematical and radiative evolution of the flow .",
    "therefore in the following we will examine such consequences through numerical simulations of the flow evolution .",
    "a first key quantity calculated through the simulations is the distribution of collision radii : this in fact controls the average value of the magnetic field strength ( which depends on the shell volume , i.e. on the shock distance ) , and the number of collisions occurring inside the blr , which in turns determines the relative importance of the radio  optical to @xmath0ray flux .",
    "figure  [ fig : raggi ] shows the distribution of radii at which collisions take place .",
    "the limit at small distances directly follows from the choice of the injection parameters , and its typical value can be approximated as : @xmath201 for an average time between two ejections @xmath202s , @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "the merged shells collide again and again at larger distances up to @xmath205 cm , where the differences among the shell velocities are completely smoothed out and the wind can be considered uniform .    the overall duration of the simulation ( @xmath206s , corresponding to 3@xmath207 shells ) has been chosen in order to reach a virtually steady state for the wind , i.e. with collisions taking place at all radii smaller than @xmath205  cm . as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : raggi ] , in the inner part ( @xmath208 cm ) the collisions are mostly between shells which have never collided before , while shells colliding at larger radii ( @xmath209@xmath210 cm ) are the result of previous mergings .",
    "about 50 per cent of the shocks occur inside the blr ( for @xmath211  cm ) , while only 7.2 per cent take place at radii @xmath212  cm .",
    "the net amount of internal energy @xmath84 released in each interaction depends on the dynamical efficiency and on the total kinetic energy of the shells available before the collision . as illustrated in the upper panel of figure [ fig :",
    "para ] the shell blfs tend to average out during the wind expansion , leading to a strong attenuation of the dynamical efficiency : this can be as high as 10 per cent for the inner collisions but decreases to less then 0.1 per cent at the largest radii .",
    "however , the outer shocks involve larger kinetic energies , as the shells are much more massive  being the result of many previous collisions . as a consequence , the average net amount of internal energy generated by each interaction is roughly constant with radius , although as few shells are left in the large scale wind , their rate of collisions is low .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the internal energy @xmath84 is shared among protons , electrons and magnetic field .",

    "[ fig : para ] shows the value of the minimum rlf of the accelerated electrons , @xmath128 , while the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : para ] represents the magnetic field strength @xmath10 for the same collisions . in some cases ,",
    "the efficiency of the collision is so small that the minimum lorentz factor of the accelerated electrons is lower than 2 .",
    "also the magnetic field is usually small in these cases .",
    "these collisions are not considered in the radiative part of the code , since the cooling time of the electrons is so long that adiabatic losses are overwhelming . in any case , the minimum lorentz factor of the electrons always excedes the thermal motion of the fraction of non accelerated ones . since @xmath84 is approximately constant with radius , the value of @xmath10 strongly anti  correlates with the collision distance approximately as @xmath213 , being inversely proportional to the square root of the volume .",
    "we can calculate what fraction of the energy produced at each location of the jet is used to accelerate electrons to relativistic energy . in the absence of non  radiative losses , this energy will be eventually entirely radiated .",
    "we then call this quantity , which is independent of the specific radiation mechanism and the timescales involved , the  differential radiative efficiency \" . the logarithmic differential efficiency , i.e. the efficiency per unit logarithmic radius , is shown in fig .  [ fig : effi ] , where we can see that the most radiatively efficient region is the inner jet ( between @xmath214 and @xmath209  cm ) , where the collision rate is the highest .    the corresponding integrated efficiency , i.e. the fraction of @xmath49 radiated from the beginning of the jet up to a given radius , is shown in fig .  [ fig : effi ] : it saturates at @xmath215 cm at a value of @xmath13 6 per cent",
    "such value can in principle depend on the input parameters , but an efficiency of a few per cent is a robust result unless a very broad distribution of the initial blfs is involved @xcite .",
    "note that the finite duration of the computation does not affect the efficiency estimate , since the differential value approaches zero at radii @xmath216 cm , much smaller than the maximum radius reached in the simulation .    from the micro  physical properties of the plasma shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : para ] it is also possible to compute the typical frequencies of the emitted photons . for the inner collisions ( @xmath217 ) synchrotron , ssc and ec are responsible for the observed radiation . at larger radii , external to the photon bath provided by the blr re - processing ,",
    "the first two mechanisms dominate the emission .",
    "the evolution of the peak frequencies corresponding to the three radiative processes along the jet is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pic ] , where their values at each radius have been obtained by averaging over all of the collisions occurring at that radius .",
    "the synchrotron peak frequency @xmath218 decreases from @xmath219 hz for the initial collisions to @xmath13 1 ghz at pc scale .",
    "the ssc peak frequency , given by @xmath220 , varies from @xmath205 to @xmath221 hz , for @xmath222 increasing from @xmath223 to @xmath209 cm .",
    "finally the ec typical frequency @xmath224hz ( for @xmath225  hz ) .",
    "let us now consider the evolution of the effective radiative efficiency , which is estimated by comparing the radiative time scales @xmath226 of relativistic electrons ( corresponding to the cooling due to the three above processes ) with the time a shock takes to cross the shell width ( i.e. the energy injection time ) @xmath227 , and the angular spread time , @xmath228",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : time ] ) . @xmath227",
    "increases from a few hr at @xmath229 cm to @xmath13  a week at @xmath209 cm , because of both the increase in the shell width and the slowing down of the shock velocity during the expansion .",
    "the angular spread time reflects the different distances traveled by photons propagating along different directions .",
    "since the observed radiation is beamed in a solid angle @xmath230 , @xmath231 corresponds to the delay in the arrival time of photons emitted at an angle @xmath232 with respect to those propagating along the line of sight : @xmath233 .",
    "this varies from a few hr to @xmath13  a week , analogously to the shell crossing time ",
    "the cooling time @xmath226 is determined by the most efficient process among synchrotron , ssc and ec . inside the blr the latter dominates , with a cooling time of less than a hr , over the @xmath13 1 day time scale of synchrotron and ssc emission . outside the blr",
    ", the synchrotron process dominates the emission , with strongly radial dependent cooling times @xmath234 1 yr . and @xmath10 decrease during the expansion .",
    "] note that inside the blr the cooling is so efficient that electrons emit most of their energy immediately after being accelerated and the pulse duration is due to a combination of the shock crossing time and geometrical effects . at these radii ,",
    "the radiation is mostly emitted ( via ec ) at high frequencies , @xmath235hz . outside the blr instead electrons cool on a time scale much longer than @xmath227 , and thus the pulse duration is set by the synchrotron cooling time and the peak frequency is in the mm range .",
    "via the numerical simulations the full time  resolved spectral behavior of the source can be determined . in this section , we directly perform comparisons of the model output quantities with observational data relative to 3c  279 , by decomposing the information into ( snapshots or time averaged ) spectra and light curves . the full time",
    " dependent behavior of the simulated source can be also examined through animations ( see _ http://www.merate.mi.astro.it/@xmath13lazzati/3c279/_ ) in which the temporal and spectral evolutions are simultaneously shown .",
    "the first step of the simulations ( see the previous section ) determines a set of physical parameters for every collision . in a second step these",
    "are then used to produce the spectral energy distributions ( sed ) emitted in each collision ( one sed for the forward and an independent sed for the reverse shock ) as described in section  [ sec : spec ] .",
    "different spectra are generated in different collisions , but general behaviors which describe the overall shape of the sed as a function of radius can be found . as already stressed the most important condition that affects",
    "the sed shape is whether the collision occurs inside or outside the blr . in figure",
    "[ fig : spettri ] we show the averaged spectra of collisions taking place within a given range of radii .",
    "shocks inside the blr produce spectra dominated by the ec process , through the scattering of electrons with energy @xmath236 on blr photons .",
    "the synchrotron peak , due to the same electrons , is located in the near infrared .",
    "a minimum occurs in the optical  uv range , while the x  ray band is characterized by a power  law spectrum . outside the blr ( lacking the ec component )",
    "the sed becomes more and more dominated by the synchrotron process : immediately outside the blr the compton parameter @xmath237 unity and the spectrum is the sum of the synchrotron and the first two compton orders ; as the radius increases , both the relativistic particle density and their average ( squared ) energy decrease , leading to progressively smaller values of @xmath160 ( if only radiative losses are considered ) . at the same time the synchrotron self  absorption frequency decreases with radius .",
    "we have so far examined the role of the various emission mechanisms at different distances along the jet .",
    "the observed spectrum is the convolution of the emission of all photons arriving at the observer simultaneously : since these are produced at different distances , it is necessary to take into account the different light propagations times when summing them up . in other words ,",
    "the resulting spectrum is the sum of all the spectra produced by shocks simultaneously active in the observer frame , taking into account the radius at which each collision is occurring and the travel path of photons to reach the observer .",
    "we therefore associate to each spectrum a photon pulse , with a start time ( the time at which the collision begins ) and a duration ( set by the combination of the timescales discussed in section  [ sec : numsim ] ) .",
    "the shape of such pulse is triangular if its duration is determined by geometrical effects and/or by the shock crossing time ( with a fwhm equal to the timescale shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : time ] ) : these are generally associated to collisions inside the blr . if the pulse duration is instead set by cooling the pulse rises linearly , as in the previous case , but after the maximum it decays exponentially [ @xmath238 : in this case the rise and decay times can be very different .",
    "-1 true cm      examples of the resulting spectra are compared to data from three different simultaneous multiwavelength campaigns of 3c279 in figure  [ fig : spectras ] .",
    "note the remarkable variability , especially at @xmath0ray energies .    within the model examined here the source high state corresponds to a time interval in which at least one of the active regions is inside the blr .",
    "the lower line shows the sed in a quiescent state of the source , i.e. when all of the active collisions are located outside the blr .",
    "the difference between the two spectra manifests itself mainly in the high frequency range , where the internal collisions , that have a shorter pulse duration , mostly contribute .",
    "although the number of external collisions is almost equal to the number of the inner ones , the former produce longer pulses : it follows that the number of those simultaneously active is higher and hence the statistical variability is suppressed .    a different way to examine the results is to determine light curves in given energy bands : figure  [ fig : lcur ] shows the flux temporal behavior in the @xmath0ray , x  ray , optical and millimeter ranges . the high frequency fluxes ( down to optical energies ) are highly variable ( again since they are produced mainly by the inner collisions ) , while the millimeter flux comes from outer shocks and thus the corresponding light curve is much smoother .    in order to study the presence of delays in the variability at different wavelengths , we added `` secular '' variations in the kinetic luminosity injected by the inner engine .",
    "in particular , this is modulated as a sinusoidal function with period @xmath13 1 year , spanning a factor of five in luminosity ( between the minimum and the maximum ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : cross ] illustrates the results of the cross correlations between the @xmath0ray and the other frequencies light curves .",
    "once again the plot shows that @xmath0ray , x  ray and optical photons are produced in the same region ( being closely correlated , with no time delay ) , while the ir emission lags by @xmath239  days , as the shells that produce high frequency photons inside the blr have to travel to larger radii ( @xmath215  cm ) to produce ir emission .",
    "the expected observed delay is given by : @xmath240 which indeed well describes the results of the simulations .",
    "finally note that time delays of the order of @xmath13 hr might occur between @xmath0ray and x  ray / optical peaks even if they are produced in the same region .",
    "however , the study of such delays would require to take into account the different light travel paths within a single region ( chiaberge & ghisellini 1999 ) , and a time dependent treatment of the shell emission , taking into account the variations in the magnetic field and electron distribution during the cooling .",
    "such a treatment is beyond the scope of the present work and will be examined in future developments of the model .",
    "highly relativistic flows dominate the dynamics and emission in both gamma  ray bursts and blazars .",
    "it has been proposed that internal shocks , produced by the interaction of flow components injected with different bulk speeds , can be responsible for the observed emission and variability in both classes of sources ( rees 1978 ; rees & meszaros 1994 ) .",
    "here we have considered in some details this ` internal shock ' scenario in the context of agn jets , self  consistently accounting for the dynamics and the radiative properties of the flow . after describing the kinematic and radiative assumptions of the model",
    ", we have examined the results of numerical simulations which allow us to study the predicted energy deposition on different jet scales , the relevant timescales , the corresponding dominating emission processes , the spectral evolution and predicted variability , the correlations among the emission at different frequencies .",
    "the key interesting features of this scenario are the relatively low radiative efficiency ( of order of a few per cent ) which well accounts for the dissipation of kinetic energy in blazars , as higher dissipation rates would create major energetic problems ( in order to carry sufficient power up to the large scale lobe structures ) .",
    "furthermore , although the radiative dissipation occurs on all jet scales , as indeed observed , the bulk of it is localized at tenths of a pc , on the blr scale , in agreement with the requirements of fast variability and transparency to @xmath0rays .",
    "the results of the simulations , based on input parameters suitable to qualitatively reproduce the observations of a powerful radio  loud quasar , such as 3c 279 , are indeed satisfactory .",
    "as expected the plasma in the inner part of the jet cools predominantly via ec emission , while on larger scales synchrotron cooling dominates .",
    "qualitative agreement is also obtained in terms of light curves , and correlations among different spectral bands are predicted .",
    "also , an asymptotic value of the bulk lorentz factor @xmath241 is achieved at distances @xmath13 pc .",
    "while this paper has been aimed at presenting the model and study its general applicability to blazar jets , the final goal is to determine which initial parameters / conditions are required in order to produce the whole of the blazar phenomenology and energetics . in particular , the model significantly constrains the typical lorentz factors ( and their distribution ) achieved through acceleration on the inner scales , and the typical timescale of plasma injection . in this respect , also",
    "the determination of the duty cycle of the @xmath0ray emission in blazars is of chief importance , as it can be used to constrain the rate and lorentz factor distribution of the injection of energy / plasma in the relativistic flow .",
    "note that although more accurate measures of @xmath0ray spectra and the detection of a much larger number of @xmath0ray loud sources will require the capabilities of glast , tight constraints on the duty cycles will be available much sooner thanks to the launch of agile .",
    "the model presented here will provide ( for the first time ) the possibility of directly modelling the time dependent broad band spectral evolution of these sources following the ( time dependent ) energy injection .",
    "the relationship between flares at high energies and the birth of superluminal radio knots and/or radio flares will be also explored .",
    "therefore issues associated with the jet energy content and the relative conversion of bulk energy into internal ( particle and field ) energy at relativistic shocks can be also constrained by the comparison of the model predictions with observations .",
    "a further aspect we intend to examine is the propagation and dissipation of jets on larger scales , where however uncertainties are large . on the @xmath242 pc  scales , significant entrainment might occur , possibly leading to the formation of external shocks and the development of slower outer layers around jets .",
    "another issues is the relative importance of creation vs amplification of an existing seed magnetic field : if the latter process prevails , it will probably lead to larger magnetic fields on the kpc scale jet , and consequently to faster synchrotron cooling .",
    "inverse compton cooling at kpc scales is instead enhanced , with respect to what calculated here , by the interaction of with the cosmic background radiation , which is seen relativistically boosted in the rest frame of the fast moving parts of the jets ( e.g. celotti , ghisellini & chiaberge , 2000 ) .",
    "we finally stress that it is of primary importance , for the understanding of the flow injection and its connection with the central accreting engine , to determine the key parameters which regulate the observed spectral and luminosity trend , from high power , low energy peaked , flat spectrum radio quasars , to weak high energy peaked bl lacs ( fossati et al .",
    "this will be the content of a forthcoming paper .",
