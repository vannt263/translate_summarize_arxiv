    "degenerate low - dimensional gases are presently attracting considerable interest as model systems to investigate beyond mean - field effects and phenomena where many - body correlations , thermal and quantum fluctuations play a relevant role  @xcite . in two dimensions ( 2d ) , it is well known that thermal excitations destroy long - range order and bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) can not exist in large bosonic systems at finite temperature  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a defect - mediated phase transition from a high - temperature normal fluid to a low - temperature superfluid was predicted by berezinskii , kosterlitz and thouless ( bkt )  @xcite and has been observed in thin films of liquid @xmath0he  @xcite . at zero temperature , fluctuations are instead negligible and bec is possible .",
    "the ground - state energy per particle of a homogeneous dilute bose gas in 2d has been first calculated by schick  @xcite and is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mass of the particles , @xmath3 is the number density and @xmath4 is the 2d scattering length .",
    "the above result holds for small values of the gas parameter , @xmath5 , and can be obtained within a mean - field approximation using the coupling constant @xmath6 the presence at low energy of a density dependent coupling constant is a peculiar feature of 2d systems .",
    "bose gases in quasi-2d have been realized with spin - polarized hydrogen on a liquid - helium surface  @xcite and with alkali - metal atoms confined in highly anisotropic harmonic traps  @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "the transverse motion of the atoms is frozen to zero - point oscillations resulting in fully 2d kinematics , but the interatomic scattering processes are still three - dimensional ( 3d ) .",
    "in fact , the 3d s - wave scattering length @xmath7 is always much smaller than the characteristic length of the tight transverse confinement .",
    "theoretical studies of quasi-2d trapped systems predict the existence of a low - temperature quasicondensate phase  @xcite whose properties have been investigated using mean - field approaches  @xcite .",
    "the nature of the transition in confined systems and whether it belongs to the bec or bkt universality class is still an open problem both experimentally and theoretically .    an important theoretical prediction for quasi-2d bose gases in harmonic traps is the renormalization of the coupling constant due to the tight confinement in one direction . to logarithmic accuracy",

    "this universal regime , where the properties of the system only depend on density and not on interaction , is highly interesting and can be realized in trapped gases by using a feshbach resonance  @xcite to achieve large values for @xmath7 .    in this work",

    "we determine the equation of state over a wide range of values of the gas parameter from the extremely dilute regime , @xmath17 , to the strongly correlated regime , @xmath18 .",
    "the calculations of the energy per particle are carried out using three different interatomic model potentials : two repulsive finite - ranged potentials and a zero - range pseudopotential which supports a two - body bound state .",
    "we investigate beyond mean - field corrections to the equation of state ( [ emf ] ) and their dependence on the gas parameter @xmath19 . in the case of the zero - range pseudopotential , from a study of the system compressibility as a function of the gas parameter we estimate that @xmath20 is the critical density at which the gas - like state becomes unstable against cluster formation .",
    "this result puts an upper limit to the value of density that can be reached in harmonic traps when one enters the regime of pure 2d scattering .",
