    "where river water meets the sea , an enormous amount of energy is dissipated as a result of the irreversible mixing of fresh and salt water .",
    "the dissipated energy is about 2 kj per liter of river water , _",
    "i.e. _ equivalent to a waterfall of 200 m  @xcite .",
    "it is estimated that the combined power from all large estuaries in the world could take care of approximately 20% of today s worldwide energy demand @xcite .",
    "extracting or storing this energy is therefore a potentially serious option that our fossil - fuel burning society may have to embrace in order to become sustainable .",
    "however , interesting scientific and technical challenges are to be faced . so far pressure - retarded osmosis ( pro ) @xcite and",
    "reverse electrodialysis ( red ) @xcite have been the two main and best - investigated techniques in this field of so - called `` blue energy '' , or salinity - gradient energy . in pro the osmotic pressure difference across a semi - permeable membrane is used to create a pressurised solution from incoming fresh and salt water , which is able to drive a turbine @xcite . in red stacks of alternating cation- and anion - exchange membranes are used to generate an electric potential difference out of a salinity gradient @xcite .",
    "these techniques enable the generation of ( electrical ) work at the expense of the mixing of streams with different salinity .",
    "actually , pro and red can be thought of as the inverse processes of reverse osmosis and electrodialyses , where one has to supply ( electrical ) work in order to separate an incoming salt - water stream in a saltier and a fresher stream . +",
    "the applicability of pro and red are currently being explored : a 1 - 2 kw prototype plant based on pro was started up in 2009 in norway @xcite , and a 5 kw red device is planned to be upscaled to a 50 kw demonstration project in the netherlands @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the bottleneck to large - scale applications of both these techniques is often _ not _ the available fuel there is a lot of fresh and salt water but rather the very large membranes that are required to operate at commercially interesting power outputs .",
    "tailoring such membranes with a very high transport capacity and minimal efficiency losses due to biofouling requires advanced membrane technology .",
    "recently , however , a solid - state device _ without _ membranes was constructed by brogioli @xcite , who directly extracts energy from salinity differences using porous carbon electrodes immersed in an aqueous electrolyte . due to the huge internal surface of porous carbon , of the order of @xmath0 m@xmath1 per gram of carbon",
    ", the capacitance of a pair of electrolyte - immersed porous carbon electrodes can be very large , allowing for large amounts of ionic charge to be stored in the diffuse part of the double layers of the electrolytic medium inside the pores @xcite .",
    "in fact , although the energy that is stored in the charged state of such large - area electrodes is somewhat lower than that in modern chargeable batteries , the power uptake and power delivery of these ultracapacitors is comparable or even larger @xcite .",
    "the capacitance of these devices not only scales with the contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte , but also with the inverse distance between the electronic charge on the electrode and the ionic charge in the diffuse part of the double layer , i.e. the capacitance increases with the inverse of the thickness of the ionic double layer . as a consequence ,",
    "the capacitance increases with increasing salinity , or , in other words , the potential increases at fixed electrode charge upon changing the medium from salt to fresh water .",
    "this variability of the capacity was used by brogioli @xcite , and also more recently by brogioli _ _ et al.__@xcite , to extract electric work from salinity gradients without membranes .",
    "although sales _ et al . _ showed that the combination of membranes and porous electrodes has some desirable advantages @xcite , we will focus here on brogioli s experiment .",
    "the key concept of ref.@xcite is a four - stage cycle abcda of a pair of porous electrodes , together forming a capacitor , such that    1 .",
    "the two electrodes , immersed in sea water , are charged up from an initial state a with low initial charges @xmath2 to a state b with higher charges @xmath3 ; 2 .",
    "the salt water environment of the two electrodes is replaced by fresh water at fixed electrode charges @xmath3 , thereby increasing the electrostatic potential of the electrodes from @xmath4 to @xmath5 ; 3 .",
    "the two highly charged electrodes , now immersed in fresh water in state c , are discharged back to @xmath2 in state d , and finally 4 .",
    "the fresh water environment of the electrodes is replaced by salt water again , at fixed electrode charges @xmath2 , thereby lowering the electrode potentials to their initial values @xmath6 in state a.    this cycle , during which a net transport of ions from salt to fresh water takes place , renders the salt water fresher and the fresh water saltier although only infinitessimally so if the reservoir volumes are infinitely large . as a consequence , the ionic entropy has increased after a cycle has been completed , and the associated free - energy reduction of the combined device and the two electrolyte reservoirs equals the electric work done by the device during the cycle , as we will see in more detail below .",
    "brogioli extrapolates an energy production of 1.6 kj per liter of fresh water in his device @xcite , equivalent to a waterfall of 160 m , quite comparable to current membrane - based techniques .",
    "these figures are promising in the light of possible future large - scale blue - energy extraction . together with the large volume of fresh and salt water at the river mouths of this planet",
    ", they also put an interesting and blessing twist to bob evans quotes at the beginning of this article .",
    "below we investigate the ( free ) energy and the performed work of electrolyte - immersed supercapacitors within a simple density functional that gives rise to a modified poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) equation for the ionic double layers . by seeking analogies with the classic carnot cycle for heat engines with their maximum efficiency to convert heat into mechanical work given the two temperatures of the heat baths , we consider modifications of brogioli s cycle that may maximise the conversion efficiency of ionic entropy into electric work given the two reservoir salt concentrations .",
    "our modification does _ not _ involve the trajectories ab and cd of the cycle where the ( dis)charging electrodes are in diffusive contact with an electrolytic reservoir with the inhomogeneously distributed salt ions `` properly '' treated grand - canonically as often advocated by bob evans @xcite .",
    "in fact , we will argue that the grand - canonical trajectories ab and cd at constant ionic chemical potential are the analogue of the isotherms in the carnot cycle .",
    "rather we consider to modify the constant - charge trajectories bc and da ( which correspond to isochores in a heat - engine as we will argue ) by a continued ( dis)charging process of the electrodes at a constant number of ions ( which corresponds to an adiabatic ( de)compression in the heat engine ) .",
    "in other words , we propose to disconnect the immersed electrodes from the ion reservoirs in bc and da , treating the salt ions canonically while ( dis)charging the electrodes , thereby affecting the ion adsorption and hence the bulk concentration from salty to fresh ( bc ) and _ vice versa _ ( da ) .",
    "finally , we will consider a ( dis)charging cycle in the ( realistic ) case of a finite volume of available fresh water , such that the ion exchange process renders this water brackish ; the heat - engine analogue is a temperature rise of the cold bath due to the uptake of heat .",
    "+ similar cycles were already studied theoretically by biesheuvel @xcite , although not in this context of osmotic power but its reverse , capacitive desalination .",
    "the `` switching step '' in biesheuvel s cycle , where the system switches from an electrolyte with a low salt concentration to an electrolyte with a higher salt concentration , appears to be somewhat different from our proposal here , e.g. without a direct heat - engine analogue .",
    "we consider two electrodes , one carrying a charge @xmath7 and the other a charge @xmath8 .",
    "the electrodes , which can charge and discharge by applying an external electric force that transports electrons from one to the other , are both immersed in an aqueous monovalent electrolyte of volume @xmath9 at temperature @xmath10 .",
    "we denote the number of cations and anions in the volume @xmath9 by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "global charge neutrality of the two electrodes and the electrolyte in the volume @xmath9 is guaranteed if @xmath13 .",
    "if the two electrodes are separated by a distance much larger than the debye screening length a condition that is easily met in the experiments of ref.@xcite then each electrode and its surrounding electrolyte will be separately electrically neutral such that @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the proton charge and where we assume @xmath16 without loss of generality .",
    "note that this `` local neutrality '' can only be achieved provided @xmath17 , where the extreme case @xmath18 corresponds to an electrode charge that is so high that all @xmath12 anions in the volume @xmath9 are needed to screen the positive electrode and all @xmath11 cations to screen the negative one . for @xmath19 ,",
    "which we assume from now on , we can use @xmath7 and @xmath20 as independent variables of a neutral system of the positive electrode immersed in an electrolyte of volume @xmath21 at temperature @xmath10 , the helmholtz free energy of which is denoted by @xmath22 . at fixed volume and temperature",
    "we can write the differential of the free energy of the positive electrode and its electrolyte environment as @xmath23 with @xmath24 the average of the ionic chemical potentials @xmath25 and @xmath26 the electrostatic potential of the electrode .",
    "the last term of eq.([df ] ) is the electric work _",
    "done on _ the system if the electrode charge is increased by @xmath27 at fixed @xmath20 , and hence the electrostatic work _ done by _ the electrode system is @xmath28 . given that @xmath29 is a state function , such that @xmath30 for any cycle , the total work _",
    "done by _ the system during a ( reversible ) cycle equals @xmath31 in order to be able to _ calculate _",
    "we thus need explicit cycles _ and _ the explicit equations - of - state @xmath33 and/or @xmath34 , for which we will use a simple density functional theory to be discussed below .    however , before performing these explicit calculations a general statement can be made , because there is an interesting analogy to be made with mechanical work @xmath35 _ done by _ a fixed amount of gas at pressure @xmath36 that cyclically changes its volume and entropy ( by exchanging heat ) . in that case",
    "the differential of the thermodynamic potential reads @xmath37 with @xmath38 a state function denoting the internal energy . since @xmath39",
    "we then find @xmath40 .",
    "if the exchange of heat takes place between two heat baths at given high and low temperatures @xmath41 and @xmath42 , it is well known that the most - efficient cycle the cycle that produces the maximum work per adsorbed amount of heat from the hotter bath is the carnot cycle with its two isothermal and two adiabatic ( de-)compressions @xcite . if we transpose all the variables from the gas performing mechanical work to the immersed electrodes performing electric work , we find @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , where all pairs preserve the symmetry of being both extensive or both intensive .",
    "the analogue of high and low temperatures are thus high and low ionic chemical potentials @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( corresponding to sea and river water , respectively ) , the analogue of the isothermal volume change is thus the ( dis)charging at constant @xmath50 , and the analogue of an adiabatic volume change is ( dis)charging at constant @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the analogue of the most efficient gas cycle is the electric cycle consisting of ( grand)canonical ( dis)charging processes .",
    "indeed , the trajectories ( ab ) and ( cd ) of the experimental cycle of ref.@xcite , as discussed in section i , are of a grand - canonical nature with the electrode in contact with a salt reservoir during the ( dis)charging",
    ". however , the processes ( bc ) and ( da ) take place at constant @xmath7 , i.e. they are equivalent to isochores in a gas cycle , instead of adiabats .",
    "efficiency is thus to be gained , at least in principle , by changing bc and da into canonical charging processes . whether this is experimentally easily implementable is , at this stage for us , an open question that we will not answer here .    for the most efficient cycles , which are schematically shown in fig.[fig : carnotcompare ] in the @xmath51 and the @xmath52 representation",
    ", we can easily calculate the work performed during a cycle . for the mechanical work of the gas one",
    "finds @xmath53 , with @xmath54 the temperature difference and @xmath55 the entropy that is exchanged between the heat baths during the isothermal compression and decompression .",
    "the analogue for the work @xmath32 delivered by the electrode is given by @xmath56 , with @xmath57 and @xmath58 the number of exchanged ions between the reservoirs during the grand - canonical ( dis)charging processes .",
    "this result also follows directly from eq.([w ] ) . below we will calculate @xmath58 and hence @xmath32 from a microscopic theory",
    "moreover , we will also consider several other types of cycles .    in the context of the thermodynamics that we discuss here , it is also of interest to analyse the `` global '' energy flow that gives rise to the work @xmath32 that the immersed porous electrodes deliver per ( reversible ) cycle .",
    "for this analysis it is crucial to realise that the device and the two salt reservoirs at chemical potentials @xmath48 and @xmath49 are considered to be at constant temperature @xmath10 throughout , which implies that they are thermally coupled to a heat bath ( that we call the `` atmosphere '' here for convenience ) at temperature @xmath10 .",
    "we will show that with every completed cycle , during which @xmath59 ions are being transported from the sea to the river water , a net amount of heat @xmath60 flows from the atmosphere to the two salt reservoirs , and that @xmath61 in the limit that the ion clouds do not store potential energy due to multi - particle interactions .",
    "this may at first sight contradict kelvin s statement of the second law ( `` no process is possible whose sole result is the complete conversion of heat into work '' @xcite ) , but one should realise that the cycle _ also _ involves the transport of ions from the sea to the river ; the word `` sole '' in kelvin s statement is thus crucial , of course .",
    "the analysis is based on the entropy changes @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 of the device , the highly - concentrated salt reservoir and the one with low salt concentration , respectively , upon the completion of a cycle .",
    "given that the device returns to its initial state after a complete cycle , its entropy change vanishes and @xmath65 .",
    "this implies that the device , at its fixed temperature , does not adsorb or desorb any net amount of heat . during a cycle",
    "the `` river '' gains @xmath58 ions , and hence its ( helmholtz or gibbs ) free energy changes by @xmath66 , while the `` sea '' loses @xmath58 ions such that @xmath67 .",
    "now the basic identity @xmath68 implies that @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the average energy ( or enthalpy if @xmath29 denotes the gibbs free energy ) per particle .",
    "we assume @xmath72 to be independent of density , which physically corresponds to the case that there are no multi - particle contributions to the internal energy of the reservoirs , as is the case for hard - core systems or ions treated within poisson - boltzmann theory as ideal gases in a self - consistent field .",
    "the total energy in the reservoirs therefore remains constant during mixing , such that the entropy changes of the salt reservoirs are @xmath73 and @xmath74 . as a consequence of the global preservation of entropy in the reversible cycle ,",
    "the ion exchange actually drives a heat exchange whereby the sea extracts a net amount of heat @xmath75 from the atmosphere , while the river dumps a net amount of heat @xmath76 into the atmosphere .",
    "of course the transport of ions itself is also accompanied with a heat exchange in between the reservoirs , the only relevant flow is therefore the net flow of heat out of the atmosphere , which is @xmath77 . the energy flow and the particle flow of the device and reservoirs are tentatively illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : flows ] , where one should realise that the distribution of the heat flow from the atmosphere into the sea ( @xmath78 ) and the river ( @xmath79 ) depends on the heat - flow from river to sea or _ vice versa _ , which we have not considered here in any detail ; _ only _ the net heat flow @xmath80 is fixed by global thermodynamic arguments .",
    "this identification of @xmath81 with @xmath32 would have the interesting implication that the conversion of this work into heat again , e.g. by using it to power a laptop , would _ not _ contribute to ( direct ) global warming since the released heat has previously been taken out of the atmosphere@xcite .",
    "it is not clear to us , however , to what extent this scenario is truly realistic and relevant , given that rivers , seas , and the atmosphere are generally _ not _ in thermal equilibrium such that other heat flows are to be considered . in this study",
    "we do not consider the heat fluxes at all , and just consider systems that are small enough for the temperature to be fixed .",
    "in order to calculate @xmath33 and @xmath34 of a charged electrode immersed in an electrolyte of volume @xmath21 , we need a microscopic model of the electrode and the electrolyte .",
    "we consider a positively charged porous electrode with a total pore volume @xmath82 , total surface area @xmath83 , and typical pore size @xmath84 .",
    "we write the total charge of the positive electrode as @xmath85 with @xmath86 the number of elementary charges per unit area .",
    "the negative electrode is the mirror image with an overall minus sign for charge and potential , see also fig.[fig : electrodes ] .",
    "the volume of the electrolyte surrounding this electrode is @xmath87 , with @xmath88 the volume of the electrolyte outside the electrode .",
    "the electrolyte consists of ( i ) water , viewed as a dielectric fluid with dielectric constant @xmath72 at temperature @xmath10 , ( ii ) an ( average ) number @xmath89 of anions with a charge @xmath90 and ( iii ) an ( average ) number @xmath91 of cations with a charge @xmath92 . the finite pore size @xmath84 inside the electrodes is taken into account here only qualitatively by regarding a geometry of two laterally unbounded parallel half - spaces representing the solid electrode , both with surface charge density @xmath93 , separated by a gap of thickness @xmath84 filled with the dielectric solvent and an inhomogeneous electrolyte characterised by concentration profile @xmath94 . here",

    "moreover , the equilibrium density profiles can be used to calculate the cationic and anionic adsorption , i.e. the excess number of ions per unit surface area , defined by @xmath126 note that we integrate the profile up to @xmath127 as required , and that our `` local charge neutrality '' assumption implies that @xmath128 .",
    "interestingly , the total surface excess of ions , defined by @xmath129 is related to the total number of ions in the volume @xmath130 by @xmath131 below we will use expression ( [ gampm ] ) and ( [ gam ] ) for @xmath132 to calculate @xmath133 from eq.([nrions ] ) , _ or _ to calculate @xmath134 by solving eq.([nrions ] ) for @xmath116 at given @xmath20 and @xmath86 .    before discussing our numerical results , it is useful to consider the limiting case @xmath135 and @xmath136 , which is in fact the classic gouy - chapman ( gc ) problem of a single , planar , charged wall in contact with a bulk electrolyte of point ions . in this case",

    "nevertheless , the pointlike nature of the ions gives rise to surface concentrations of counterions that easily become unphysically large , e.g. far beyond 10 m for the parameters of interest here .",

    "[ fig : potchargerel](a ) is that gc theory breaks down at surface charge densities beyond @xmath175 nm@xmath152 , where steric effects prevent too dense a packing of condensing counterions such that the actual surface potential rises much more strongly with @xmath86 than the logarithmic increase of gc theory ( see eq.([psigc ] ) ) .",
    "this rise of the potential towards @xmath176 v may induce ( unwanted ) electrolysis in experiments , so charge densities exceeding , say , 5@xmath15 nm@xmath152 should perhaps be avoided .",
    "a second observation is that the finite pore size @xmath84 hardly affects the @xmath177 relation for @xmath178 nm@xmath152 , provided the steric effects are taken into account .",
    "the reason is that the effective screening length is substantially smaller than @xmath84 in these cases due to the large adsorption of counterions in the vicinity of the electrode .",

    "this is due to the finite pores size , which is _ not _ much larger than @xmath180 in these cases , such that the ionic double layers must be distorted : by increasing @xmath26 a donnan - like potential is generated in the pore that attracts enough counterions to compensate for the electrode charge in the small available volume .",

    "this cycle has exactly the same trajectory ab characterised by @xmath206 as before .",
    "state point c at @xmath201 and @xmath207 has , however , a much smaller number of ions @xmath208 than @xmath209 in state b and c , because its surface charge @xmath210 .",

    "is also illustrated in fig.[fig : cyclus2 ] , where the two cycles abcda ( a ) and abcda ( b ) are shown in the @xmath20-@xmath50 representation . whereas the total area of ( b ) is larger than that of ( a ) , so @xmath219 according to eq.([w ] ) ,",
    "the larger spread in @xmath222 compared to @xmath58 renders the efficiency of ( b ) smaller .",

    "this is illustrated in table 1 , which lists @xmath32 and @xmath215 per unit area and per transported ion for several choices of @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "the data of table 1 shows that @xmath219 by up to a factor 2 , while @xmath223 by up to a factor of three for @xmath187 , and a factor 8 for @xmath224 .",
    "we thus conclude that the choice for a particular cycle to generate electric work depends on optimization considerations ; our results show that maximum work or maximum efficiency do not necessarily coincide .",
    "table 1 not only shows the work per area and per ion , but in the last column also @xmath225 with @xmath226 , _ i.e. _ the work per charge that is put on the electrode during the charging of trajectory ab .",
    "interestingly , in these units the work is comparable to @xmath227 provided @xmath228 , as also follows from gouy - chapman theory for highly charged surfaces .",
    "note that the work per transported charge does _ not _ equal the amount of performed work per transported ion as @xmath229 is typically much larger than @xmath230 .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that @xmath231 gives us a handle to link our results with the experiments of brogioli @xcite . during the experiment , the charge on the electrodes varies by @xmath232 @xmath233c , such that one arrives at an expected work of 6 @xmath50j per electrode .",
    "this agrees reasonably well with the obtained value of 5 @xmath234 out of the entire system .",
    "unfortunately , the relation between the electrostatic potential and the charge in the experiments differs significantly from that of our theory by at least hundreds of millivolts ; at comparable electrostatic potentials the charge density in brogioli s experiments is almost two orders of magnitude smaller than our theoretical estimates .",
    "therefore a qualitative comparison with the brogioli - cycle is at this point very hard .",
    "the relatively low experimental charge densities clarify the lower amount of work produced per gram of electrode , which was noted earlier in the text . including the stern layer may be a key ingredient that is missing in the present analysis @xcite .",

    "we converted @xmath32 and @xmath215 to room temperature thermal energy units @xmath237 , and not only express them per unit electrode area @xmath83 but also per exchanged number of ions @xmath58 and @xmath222 during the two cycles , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath220 is a property of the two reservoirs , not of the charge densities of the cycle .",
    "also note that @xmath221 depends on the volume @xmath88 of electrolyte outside the electrodes , here we successively give values for the optimal situation @xmath187 as well as for the situation @xmath238 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "of course many more cycles are possible . the two cycles abcda and abcda considered",
    "so far generate electric work out of the mixing of two very large reservoirs of salt and fresh water , taking up ions from high - salt water and releasing them in fresh water .",
    "due to the large volume of the two reservoirs the ionic chemical potentials @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and hence the bulk salt concentrations @xmath200 and @xmath201 in the reservoirs , do not change during this transfer of a finite number of ions during a cycle .",
    "however , there could be relevant cases where the power output of an osmo - electric device is limited by the finite inflow of fresh water , which then becomes brackish due to the mixing process ; usually there is enough sea water to ignore the opposite effect that the sea would become less salty because of ion drainage by a cycle . in other words , the volume of fresh water can not always be regarded as infinitely large while the salt water reservoir is still a genuine and infinitely large ion bath .",
    "the cycle with a limited fresh water supply is equivalent to a heat - engine that causes the temperature of its cold `` bath '' to rise due to the release of rest heat from a cycle , while the hot heat bath does not cool down due to its large volume or heat capacity .",
    "here we describe and quantify a cycle abca that produces electric work by reversibly mixing a finite volume of fresh water with a reservoir of salt water .",
    "we consider a finite volume @xmath239 of fresh water with a low salt concentration @xmath236 m , such that the number of ions in this compartment equals @xmath240 .",
    "this fresh water is assumed to be available at the beginning of a ( new ) cycle ; its fate at the end of the cycle is to be as salty as the sea by having taken up @xmath241 ions from the electrode ( which received them from the sea ) , with @xmath235 m the salt concentration in the sea .",
    "the cycle , which is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : newcycle ] , starts with the electrodes connected to a large volume of sea water at concentration @xmath200 , charged up in state a at a charge density @xmath242 nm@xmath152 . during the first part ab of the cycle ,",
    "the electrodes are further charged up until the positive one has taken up @xmath241 ions in its pores , which fixes the surface charge @xmath243 nm@xmath152 in state b. then the electrodes are to be disconnected from the sea , after which the charging proceeds in trajectory bc such that the increasing ion adsorption at a fixed total ion number reduces the salt chemical potential down to @xmath49 ( and hence the salt concentration far from the electrode surface down to @xmath201 ) at @xmath244 nm@xmath152 in state c. the system can then be reversibly coupled to the finite compartment of initially fresh water , after which the discharging process ca takes place such that the released ions cause the fresh water to become more salty , reaching a charge density @xmath147 when the salt concentration in the compartment of volume @xmath245 equals @xmath200 .",
    "the cycle can then be repeated by replacing the compartment @xmath245 by fresh water again .",
    "the relation between the surface potential @xmath26 , the charge density on the electrodes @xmath86 , and the ion reservoir concentration @xmath116 or the ion number @xmath20 , was numerically calculated using the modified pb - equation ( [ modpb ] ) with bc s  ( [ bc1 ] ) and  ( [ bc2 ] ) , combined with the adsorption relation ( [ gam ] ) , with the same parameters @xmath169 , @xmath170 nm , @xmath183 nm , and @xmath246 as before . the enclosed area in fig .",
    "[ fig : newcycle ] gives , using eq.([w ] ) , the net amount of ( reversible ) work @xmath32 performed during a cycle , which again equals the decrease of the free energy of the salt water reservoir and fresh water volume combined .",

    "this result agrees with the prediction by pattle  @xcite for very small @xmath201 . for the parameters of the cycle discussed here",
    ", we find @xmath249 kj per liter of fresh water , or @xmath250 nm@xmath152 .",
    "the figures show that the amount of work per ion that is transported is typically smaller than what we found for the carnot - like cycle , of course .",
    "+ we may compare this reversible cycle with the one proposed by biesheuvel for the reverse process , which is called desalination .",
    "this cycle is very similar to ours , except that biesheuvel s switching step from sea - to river water and v.v .",
    "is actually an iso-@xmath141 trajectory instead of our iso-@xmath20 tracjectory .",
    "this iso - adsorption trajectory does not seem to have a reversible heat engine analogue , as the degree of reversibility depends on the extent to which the electrolyte can be drained out of the micropores before . nevertheless , we find agreement with the work that must be provided in the case of only a relatively small output volume of fresh water , and the expression found by biesheuvel exactly equals eq .",
    "( [ newwork ] ) .",
    "the point we would like to stress is that irreversible mixing during the switching step can be prevented by introducing a canonical(iso-@xmath20 ) part into the cycle which enables the system to adapt to a new salt concentration in a time - reversible fashion , such that maximal efficiency is preserved .",
    "although substantial attempts to extract renewable energy from salinity gradients go back to the 1970 s , there is considerable recent progress in this field stemming from the availability of high - quality membranes @xcite and large - area nanoporous electrodes @xcite with which economically interesting yields of the order of 1 kj per liter of fresh water can be obtained equivalent to a waterfall of one hundred meter . the key concept in the recent experiments of brogioli @xcite is to cyclically ( dis)charge a supercapacitor composed of two porous electrodes immersed in sea ( river ) water . in this article",
    "we have used a relatively simple density functional , based on mean - field electrostatics and a lattice - gas type description of ionic steric repulsions , to study the relation between the electrode potential @xmath26 , the electrode surface charge density @xmath86 , the ion adsorption @xmath141 , the ion chemical potential @xmath50 , and the total number of ions @xmath20 in a ( slit - like ) pore of width @xmath84 that should mimic the finite pores of the electrodes . with this microscopic information at hand , we have analysed several cycles of charging and discharging electrodes in sea and river water . by making an analogy with heat engines , for which the most - efficient cycle between two heat baths at fixed temperatures is the carnot cycle with isothermal and adiabatic ( de)compressions , we considered cycles composed of iso@xmath251 and iso@xmath252 ( dis)charging processes of the electrodes .",
    "we indeed found that these cycles are maximally efficient in the sense that the work per ` consumed ' ion that is transported from the sea to the river water during this cycle is optimal , given the salt concentrations in the river- and sea water .",
    "however , although the cycles used by brogioli , with two iso@xmath251 and two iso@xmath253 trajectories ( where the latter are analogous to isochores in the heat - engine ) are less efficient per transported ion , the total work of a `` brogioli - cycle '' is larger , at least when comparing cycles that share the iso@xmath251 charging in the sea water trajectory .",
    "we find , for electrode potentials @xmath254 mv and electrode charge densities @xmath255 nm@xmath256 in electrolytes with salt concentrations @xmath235 m ( sea water ) and @xmath236 m ( river water ) , typical amounts of delivered work of the order of several @xmath237 per transported ion , which is equivalent to several @xmath237 per nm@xmath1 of electrode area or several kj per liter of consumed fresh water .",
    "+ our calculations on the brogioli type of cycle agree with experiments regarding the amount of performed work per cycle with respect to the variance in the electrode charge during ( dis- ) charging ; each unit charge is responsible for an amount of work that is given by the difference in chemical potential between the two reservoirs .",
    "however , the experimental data concerning the electrostatic potential could _ not _ be mapped onto our numerical data .",
    "this could very well be due to the fact that the pore size in the experiments by brogioli is very small such that ion desolvation , ion polarisability , and image charge effects may be determining the relation between the surface charge and electrostatic potential .",
    "models which go beyond the present mean - field description are probably required for a quantitative description of this regime .",
    "another ingredient in a more detailed description must involve the finite size of the ions combined with the microscopic roughness of the carbon .",
    "the ions in the solvent and the electrons ( holes ) in the electrode material can not approach infinitely close , and the resulting charge free zone can be modeled by a stern capacitance .",
    "standard gouy - chapman - stern ( gcs ) theory has successfully been applied to fit charge - voltage curves for porous carbon capacitive cells @xcite within the context of osmo - electrical and capacitive desalination devices .",
    "extensions to gcs theory are currently being developed which include finite pore sizes , in order to obtain a physically realistic and simultaneously accurate model of the stern layer within this geometry .",
    "+ throughout this work we ( implicitly ) assumed the cycles to be reversible , which implies that the electrode ( dis)charging is carried out sufficiently slowly for the ions to be in thermodynamic equilibrium with the instantaneous external potential imposed by the electrodes .",
    "this reversibility due to the slowness of the charging process has the advantage of giving rise to optimal conversion from ionic entropy to electric work in a given cycle .",
    "however , if one is interested in optimizing the _ power _ of a cycle , _ i.e. _ the performed work per unit time , then quasistatic processes are certainly not optimal because of their inherent slowness .",
    "heuristically one expects that the optimal power would result from the trade - off between reversibility ( slowness ) to optimize the work per cycle on the one hand , and fast electronic ( dis)charging processes of the electrodes and fast fluid exchanges on time scales below the relaxation time of the ionic double layers on the other .",
    "an interesting issue is the diffusion of ions into ( or out of ) the porous electrode after switching on ( or off ) the electrode potential @xcite .",
    "ongoing work in our group employs dynamic density functional theory @xcite to find optimal - power conditions for the devices and cycles studied in this paper , e.g. focussing on the delay times between the electrode potential and the ionic charge cloud upon voltage ramps .",
    "+ the recovery of useful energy from the otherwise definite entropy increase at estuaries , which may be relevant because our planet is so full of water , is just one example where one can directly build on bob evans fundamental work on ( dynamic ) density functional theory , inhomogeneous liquids , electrolytes , interfaces , and adsorption .",
    "it is a great pleasure to dedicate this paper to bob evans on the occasion of his 65th birthday .",
