    "all - sky mid - infrared surveys have revolutionized the science of planet formation by discovering populations of young stars and main sequence stars with excess infrared radiation indicating the presence of dusty circumstellar disks .",
    "these disks , which include gas - rich protoplanetary disks around young stellar objects ( ysos ) and dusty debris disks around main sequence stars , serve as the signposts of planet formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the iras all sky survey discovered the first extrasolar debris disks @xcite and provided a large sample of debris disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "after iras , akari surveyed the whole sky at 9 and 18 @xmath0 m with @xmath1 times better sensitivity than iras , finding many more new disks .",
    "some disk discoveries have come from pointed studies , like the spitzer formation and evolution of planetary systems ( feps ) survey @xcite .",
    "but many of the best - studied , most informative disks ( like tw hydra , fomalhaut , etc . )",
    "are relatively isolated on the sky , requiring an all - sky survey to find them .",
    "nasa s wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) is the most recent and sensitive all - sky mid - infrared survey @xcite , with a further factor of @xmath2 gain in sensitivity over akari in the mid - ir . using a 16-inch mirror in a sun - synchronous polar orbit ,",
    "wise scanned the sky at 3.4 @xmath0 m , 4.6 @xmath0 m , 12 @xmath0 m , and 22 @xmath0 m ( bands w1 , w2 , w3 , and w4 respectively ) .",
    "the wise cryogenic mission , launched in 2009 , lasted a little over 10 months and was followed by the first post - cyrogenic mission , neowise .",
    "the allwise catalog combines data from both phases , making it the most comprehensive mid - infrared multi - epoch view of the sky available today .",
    "previous infrared surveys for debris disks have provided target lists for exoplanet searches via direct imaging @xcite .",
    "debris disks found with wise should provide crucial targets for upcoming generations of exoplanet searches .",
    "wise could detect debris disks around main sequence a stars to a distance of 300 pc and protoplanetary disks around t tauri stars to 1 kpc .",
    "indeed , many teams have used the wise data to find new debris disks , searching a vast catalog of @xmath3 million wise sources .",
    "@xcite cross - correlated the wise source list with the hipparcos catalog , finding over 86,000 stars with suspected infrared excesses .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite performed more careful searches for debris disks in the wise source list using the hipparcos catalog and found 6 , 70 and 108 new debris disk candidates , respectively . other specific surveys for debris disks have focused on stars with ages determined from chromospheric activity @xcite , white dwarfs @xcite , m dwarfs , g - k dwarfs @xcite , kepler candidate exoplanet systems and other exoplanet catalogs @xcite .    likewise , the wise data on young clusters and star - forming regions have attracted much attention .",
    "@xcite scoured the taurus - auriga region . @xcite",
    "searched 11 outer galaxy massive star - forming regions and three open clusters .",
    "other studies have examined smaller regions , like the western circinus molecular cloud @xcite , the young open cluster ic 1805 the region s155 @xcite , the sco - cen and @xmath4 cha associations @xcite , nearby moving groups of young stars @xcite and @xmath5 and @xmath6 orionis @xcite",
    ". still others have attempted to take in the whole sky , using color cuts or cross correlating with iras @xcite .",
    "many of these searches were based on preliminary data releases with less sensitivity than the allwise release , but they have already uncovered thousands of candidate class i , ii and iii ysos and transitional disks , helping fill in our picture of the timing and progression of star formation .",
    "unfortunately , because of its limited spatial resolution ( 12 arcsec at 22 @xmath0 m ) contamination and confusion limit every search for disks with wise ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "contamination sources include unresolved companion stars and other stars nearby on the sky , background galaxies , galactic cirrus , and even asteroids and airplanes .",
    "for this reason , most recent searches include visual inspection of the wise images ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "computer cuts alone can provide a first stage of vetting , but they generate catalogs riddled with false positives @xcite ; . color cuts and source quality flags can help , but the color loci of disk candidates overlaps with the color loci of blended background galaxies @xcite and peaks in the galactic dust emission .",
    "@xcite used the iras 100 @xmath0 m level to discard many false positive disk candidates contaminated with galactic dust emission , but using this method prohibits searching many interesting star - forming regions .",
    "because of these challenges , many disks remain to be found with wise data , even after all the efforts described above .",
    "the largest published study of debris disks @xcite and the still larger wise science team disk study ( padgett et al . in prep . )",
    "are based on the hipparcos and tycho catalogs .",
    "these catalogs are magnitude limited in v band , so they omit a vast population of redder , late type stars .",
    "moreover , a vast solid angle in young clusters and star - forming regions remains to be properly searched with wise  each candidate examined by eye and followed up with spectroscopy and higher resolution imaging .",
    "when ran the all - sky data through a novel color filter to search for yso candidates ( without vetting the candidates by eye ) , he found a total of @xmath7 objects of interest ; the wise studies of young clusters and star - forming regions described above ( which mostly included visual vetting ) yielded a total of @xmath8 disk candidates .",
    "the difference between these numbers provides a minimal measure of what remains for us to study with wise : @xmath9 objects with colors consistent with ysos that have not yet been visually inspected .",
    "here we describe a new project to scour the wise data for new debris disks and ysos .",
    "the disk detective citizen science / crowdsourcing project classifies wise sources via a website , diskdetective.org , where volunteers examine images from wise , the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , the digitized sky survey ( dss ) and when available , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , to check them for false positives .",
    "this approach should allow us to unleash the full potential of wise for finding new disks , probing the cooler stars and isolated objects missed by previous debris disk searches , a catalog 8 times the size of the large @xcite survey .",
    "we describe the online vetting process in section [ sec : approach ] , our small - telescope follow - up program in section [ sec : followup ] and we present our first list of 37 disk candidates in section [ sec : candidates ] .",
    "disk detective is a new addition to the successful zooniverse network of citizen science alliance projects @xcite .",
    "visitors to the site ( `` users '' ) view `` flipbooks '' showing several images of the same source at different wavelengths .",
    "figure  [ fig_screenshot ] shows a sample screenshot from diskdetective.org illustrating one frame in a flipbook .",
    "after they view the flipbooks , users answer a question , `` what best describes the object you see ? '' , by clicking on one or more of six buttons . the site then records the user s choice(s ) for interpretation by the disk detective science team and offers the user another source to classify .",
    "this approach is borrowed from another zooniverse project , snapshot serengeti ( http://www.snapshotserengeti.org ) .",
    "snapshot serengeti shows users flipbooks of wildlife photographs , asking users to identify animal and bird species that appear in the images , taking advantage of the human eye s ability to spot moving objects camouflaged by noise @xcite . at disk detective , instead of identifying animals in the grasses of the serengeti , users identify clean point sources in a forest of astrophysical and instrumental contaminants : galaxies , ism , artifacts , etc .",
    "the flipbooks in disk detective generally consist of ten images of each source : images in four wise bands , three bands from the 2-micron all sky survey @xcite and three bands from the digital sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "when possible , we use images from the sdss seventh data release instead of dss ; these sdss data cover about 1/4 of the sky ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the images are independently scaled using idl color table 1 ( blue / white ) , matching the color scale to the full range of the data .",
    "hence , the flipbook approach works better than attempting to show all these bands in a single multi - color image , which would tend to be dominated by one or two bands . overlaid on every flipbook",
    "is a circle with a radius of 10.5 arcseconds , roughly the area we must ensure is free of contamination before we can trust the photometry .",
    "( the circle s radius was chosen conservatively ; the nominal resolution of wise at 22 @xmath0 m is 12 arcseconds fwhm . ) also , overlaid on each image is a cross marking the center of the image at the wise 3.4 @xmath0 m band ( w1 ) and indicating the expected uncertainty in position for an uncontaminated point source .",
    "the disk candidates are unresolved by wise , so our search image is a tightly concentrated red object , possibly with diffraction spikes , that does not shift position from band to band .",
    "users view the flipbook by clicking on an arrow - shaped `` play '' button on the lower left of the screen , shown in figure  [ fig_screenshot ] .",
    "they also have the option to scroll through the flipbook frame by frame using the scrub bar beneath it .",
    "the frames are each labeled with the wavelength and the name of the survey that yielded the image , e.g. , `` 2mass k ( 2.16 @xmath0 m ) '' .",
    "after a user has viewed the whole flipbook , he or she can then choose from among six classification buttons to click on , labeled `` multiple objects in the red circle '' , `` object moves off the crosshairs '' , `` extended beyond circle in wise images '' `` empty circle in wise images '' , `` not round in dss2 or 2mass images '' and `` none of the above / good candidate '' . with the exception of the `` none of the above '' option , the user can choose more than one description per flipbook .",
    "after at least one of these classification buttons is chosen , a button labeled `` finish '' becomes active ; clicking this button records the user s choices and causes the next flipbook to appear .",
    "since its launch , disk detective has attracted a vast user community .",
    "roughly 1.5 million classifications have been performed so far , by roughly 28,000 volunteers .",
    "roughly half of the classifications come from an enthusiastic group of `` superusers '' .",
    "fifteen superusers have already classified @xmath10 sources each ; seven have classified @xmath11 .",
    "the superusers started their own email discussion group via google groups to work together on disk detective issues .",
    "they now help train other users and form a crucial extension of the disk detective science team ( see below ) .",
    "communication with disk detective users is aided by the new zooniverse translation crowdsourcing tool . using this online tool",
    ", volunteers have translated the site into spanish , french , russian , german , hungarian , polish , bahasa , romanian , portuguese , japanese , and chinese ( traditional and simplified characters ) ; the translated sites are accessible via a link in the upper right corner of site .",
    "the diskdetective.org site is tied into the `` talk '' social network common to zooniverse sites .",
    "talk has a page for each subject on disk detective that provides a simple spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for the object composed of the 2mass and allwise photometry and also a link to the simbad page on the source if one exists . on talk",
    ", users can create and maintain collections of their favorite subjects by clicking on a button labeled `` collect '' .      to choose sources to upload to the website , we performed some initial computer - based cuts on the wise data , informed by published debris disk searches ( see above ) but not limited by the hipparcos or tycho catalogs , for example .",
    "we utilized signal - to - noise cuts ( ` w4snr , w1sigmpro w4rchi2 and w4sigmpro ` ) and some of the allwise catalog flags ( ` cc_flags , xscprox , na , nb , n_2mass , and ext_flg ` ) to remove sources that were noisy or close to known extended sources .",
    "though many searches have used sophisticated color cuts to focus on particular kinds of disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we kept our color cuts minimal to cast as broad a net as possible . to preselect sources with infrared excesses , we merely removed all sources with [ w4 ] @xmath12 [ w1]-0.25 .",
    "( [ w1 ] is magnitude in the wise 3.4 @xmath0 m band , and [ w4 ] is magnitude in the wise 22 @xmath0 m band . )",

    "we soon realized that most of the volunteer effort was being spent classifying faint , extragalactic sources , so we decided to impose a magnitude limit on the search .",
    "we chose a criterion of @xmath19 because the subjects brighter than this magnitude were clearly concentrated in the galactic plane , while fainter subjects appeared to be isotropically distributed on the sky .",
    "we uploaded a second batch of 272,022 subjects on may 30 , 2014 .",
    "this second batch covered the rest of the sky , but was limited to @xmath19 .",
    "we also deactivated all the previously uploaded and active @xmath20 subjects on this date , so presently the @xmath20 subjects currently make up a small subset of the data for which we have classifications .",
    "we examine the classification data weekly to chart our progress . as of august 25 , 2015 ,",
    "the selection of classification buttons had the distribution shown in table  [ tab : buttons ] .",
    "clearly , the dominant false positive rejected by the classification process is `` multiple objects in the red circle '' .",
    "note that the `` empty circle in wise images '' button exists mainly to allow users a reasonable response option if , for example , there were a network glitch .",
    "none of the data actually had empty circles in all the wise images , though some subjects did have empty red circles in a single band , and some users chose this `` empty circle in wise images '' classification for such subjects .",

    "the classification with the most votes becomes the official classification . by the majority algorithm ,",
    "the official classification is one with @xmath21% of the votes , if one exists .    to help test these algorithms , we prepared a `` gold standard '' data set of 500 subjects classified by the members of the science team .",
    "all of the subjects in this `` gold standard '' data set were classified by two or more science team members , and all tie votes were discarded .",
    "this process showed that science team members agree with one another at roughly the 82% level as to whether an object is `` good '' or not . a challenge in creating this `` gold standard",
    "'' set was that sometimes science team members ruled out candidates based on their expertise / outside information rather than strictly doing what the website asked for .",
    "there was also a range in terms of how conservative the science team members were in terms of crowded fields and ism background .",
    "for example , the yso experts ( used to looking in the galactic plane ) on the science team tolerated background objects and `` extended '' objects more readily than the debris disk experts on the team .",
    "the majority algorithm performed well at selecting objects deemed to be classified as `` none of the above / good candidate '' . on a randomly selected group of about 500 subjects , 94% of those classified as `` none of the above / good candidate '' by the majority algorithm agreed with the gold standard set rankings . for the other five classification buttons , the agreement between classifications selected via the plurality algorithm and the gold standard set varied : 52% for `` extended '' , 54% for `` not round '' , 24% for `` object moves off the crosshairs '' , and 7% for `` empty circle '' .",
    "this lack of agreement suggests that users may be sometimes neglect to click _ all _ of the relevant buttons when a subject is `` bad '' for more than one reason .",
    "however , since our desire is simply to rule out false positives , this lack of agreement on the precise nature of the false positive does not hamper our study .",
    "deciding on classifications via the plurality algorithm generally leads to larger disagreements with the gold standard set and the classification data .",
    "the exception to this rule seems to be the case of `` multiple objects in the red circle '' ; subjects classified as such by the plurality vote agree with the gold standard set 96% of the time .",
    "table  [ tab : buttons ] shows the total selection distribution between the categories on the main site from the first @xmath22 million classifications .",
    "users selected the `` good '' button nearly 20% of the time . using the majority algorithm to determine a final classification , we get an 16% yield of `` good '' objects based on those classifications .    some of the brighter disk detective subjects show diffraction spikes and noise from detector saturation , especially in dss , sloan , and wise 1 images .",
    "when we launched disk detective we did not explicitly explain these phenomena anywhere on the site , though we readily answered questions about them in the chat forum talk . nonetheless , many of our first users interpreted bright stars with spikes as `` oval '' or in some cases `` extended '' . on march 31 , 2014",
    ", we edited the spotters guide and the tutorial at diskdetective.org to include examples with diffraction spikes , which greatly reduced the problem , but some of these mistakes persist in our data .",
    "we expect this confusion over diffraction spikes to get better over time , as most of our classifications now come from participants who are well aware of the problem .      with nearly 300,000 total objects from allwise to classify and 18 - 25% yield described above",
    ", we estimate that the online classification scheme at diskdetective.org will produce up to 75,000 good objects , still a daunting number to investigate . however , the automated online classification stage is just the beginning of our vetting process .",
    "the next stage of the process aims to harvest disk detective objects of interest ( ddois ) , subjects that we consider deserving of additional follow - up observations .    for this next stage of vetting",
    ", we created a collection of google spreadsheets which both the science team and the superusers could edit .",
    "we first populated the spreadsheets with subjects chosen as `` none of the above / good candidate '' using the latest classification data .",
    "we chose subjects in the right portion of the sky for any upcoming follow - up observations and also populated the lists in order of agreement fractions and brightness ( in j band ) , ensuring that the bright subjects , and those with high agreement percentages were looked at first .",
    "then we invited the superusers to add their own favorite objects , which they collect using tools on the talk social network .",
    "we also invited the entire disk detective user community to submit subjects automatically via a google form ( but not directly edit the spreadsheet ) .",
    "we coached the superusers on how to research each source in simbad and vizier ( and sometimes ned ) to fill in information about spectral type , proper motion , variability , parallax , prior observations , and make comments on the sed , etc .",
    "then we checked the superusers s comments and selected the follow - up targets ( ddois ) from the list based on the following criteria .    1",
    ".   simbad object descriptions excluding post - agb stars , carbon stars , novae , cepheids , cataclysmic variables , high - mass x - ray binaries , eclipsing binaries , galaxies , active galactic nuclei , planetary nebulae , reflection nebulae , rotational variables , symbiotic stars , or wolf - rayet stars .",
    "note that we did keep sources with simbad object descriptions shell star , orion variable , and white dwarf .",
    "2 .   no long period variables ( lpvs ) , sr+l , slow irregular variables , miras , semi - regular variables , semiregular pulsating variables , or carbon stars based on literature searches .",
    "3 .   including only spectral types b through m according to simbad , when a type is available .",
    "only about half of the subjects have entries in simbad .",
    "so we often relied on vizier to help us search the relevant literature .",
    "many of the subjects had unknown spectral types , and many were severely reddened .",
    "so at this stage of the vetting process , we often simply labeled sources as `` late - type based on color .",
    "''    1 .",
    "no sign that the wise 1 photometry drops out due to saturation , based on visual inspection of the sed .",
    "2 .   no known companions within @xmath23 , except for spectroscopic binaries .",
    "3 .   for m stars and other subjects with @xmath24 , we require @xmath25 - [ w4 ] > 0.9 $ ] .",
    "the peak of the thermal emission from cool star photospheres may lie at long enough wavelengths that the rayleigh - jeans limit no longer accurately describes the photosphere s @xmath25 - [ w4 ] $ ] color even in the absence of circumstellar dust .",
    "hence , we impose this more stringent requirement of 0.9 magnitudes of 22 @xmath0 m excess for these cool subjects . for some red subjects ,",
    "however , we find that the sed clearly curves upwards at w4 ; we do not exclude these subjects .    in the process",
    ", we naturally rediscovered many known disks .",
    "so we added the following additional criterion :    1 .",
    "no sources that have already been imaged by a pointed space mission ( i.e. _ spitzer _ , herschel , hst ) or 8-m class telescope ( i.e. keck , gemini , vlt , magellan ) ( based on the published literature ) , except those without good quality spectral types ( simbad quality c or higher ) .    our search includes many sources in and near the galactic plane and many sources with no parallax measurements from hipparcos .",
    "but since these sources require extra care , we have added two additional criteria for the purpose of this paper :    1 .",
    "no sources within @xmath26 of the galactic plane .    1 .",
    "only sources with parallax measurements from hipparcos .",
    "most of the subjects on the vetting spreadsheets do not meet these additional eight criteria .",
    "but sources that do meet all these criteria ( plus the criteria in table  [ tab : cuts ] , of course ) we label as ddois and place in our our queue for follow - up observations .",
    "so far we have collected 770 ddois in total that have survived the above vetting by the science team and/or by multiple superusers . of these , 517 have classification histories via the main disk detective online classification tool .",
    "the remaining ddois have minimal classification data , since they were submitted directly by volunteers , and some volunteers choose to flip through images on talk rather than the main site .",
    "the yield at this stage varies greatly depending on how we rank the spreadsheets .",
    "higher galactic latitudes provide higher yields , as do sources that are brighter in wise 4 .",
    "also , as our users have become more educated , they have become better at selecting subjects to place on the spreadsheets , which raises the yield .",
    "but as of now , the typical yield at this stage of vetting ( ddois per source on the vetting spreadsheet ) is about 12% .    multiplying the size of the input catalog by the automated vetting yield ( 24.4% ) and then by the ddoi vetting yield ( about 12% ) gives a final yield of about 3% and an estimate of the total number of ddois we ultimately expect to discover of @xmath27",
    "this estimate suggests that our search is presently about 10% complete .",
    "however , it is worth noting that many of these criteria , while catching a lot of the aforementioned agb stars that pollute our `` good '' candidate list , also eliminate a population of yso disks and m stars ( for example , ysos can be irregular variables ) .",
    "the ddois have all been carefully vetted by hand and researched in the literature by multiple scientists and/or well - trained superusers .",
    "so this list of sources serves as a reference set of subjects that we can use to make decisions about how to run the vetting .",
    "one major consideration of any citizen science project is when to remove , or `` retire , '' subjects from classifications on the site . to make that decision",
    ", we need to know roughly how long it takes the user population to converge on an answer .",
    "figure  [ fig_agreement ] shows how the standard deviation of the agreement for majority - algorithm ruled `` good '' candidates in our ddoi set varies with number of total classifications . for these subjects , `` agreement ''",
    "is defined simply as the number of good classifications divided by the total number of classifications the subject has received . between 10 - 15 classifications , the standard deviation of the agreement for this subset of `` good '' ddoi candidates levels off , suggesting that there would be minimal marginal benefit from requiring additional classifications beyond this point .",
    "thus the current iteration of the site uses a conservative 15 total classifications as our benchmark for when to retire subjects .",
    "we obtained and analyzed spectra for our ddois using the fast spectrograph @xcite on the tillinghast 1.5 m telescope at fred lawrence whipple observatory during may ",
    "october 2014 , employing the 300 mm@xmath28 grating and the 3  slit .",
    "these spectra cover 38007500   at a resolution of @xmath29 6  .",
    "we flux- and wavelength - calibrated the spectra using the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) software system . after trimming the ccd frames at each end of the slit , we corrected for the bias level , flat - fielded each frame , applied an illumination correction , and derived a full wavelength solution from calibration lamps acquired immediately after each exposure . the wavelength solution for each frame has a probable error of @xmath300.51.0  .",
    "we extracted sources and sky spectra using the optimal extraction algorithm within apextract .",
    "the absolute flux - calibration for each night relies on observations of 2 - 5 standard stars @xcite and has an uncertainty of @xmath305%10% .",
    "this follow - up spectroscopy has proven vital to our vetting of ddois .",
    "roughly half of all ddois initially have no reliable spectral type .",
    "additionally , for these objects the luminosity class is generally completely unconstrained , save for clues from parallax and proper motion measurements .",
    "this situation is more dire for red ( or reddened ) sources and late - type stars , which will be the subject of future work .",
    "m giants often produce their own dust , so disks around these stars are not of particular interest from the perspective of planet formation . fast spectroscopy also allows us to screen for certain false positives , such as blended agn .    though our initial candidate list in this paper is small",
    ", we plan to follow - up on the entire list of ddois and thus will have a large number of observed spectra .",
    "manual spectral classification of every object is highly inefficient . to speed up the process",
    ", we used the semiautomatic quantitative spectral - typing code sptclass , an iraf / idl code based on the methodology outlined in @xcite .",
    "we decided that in this first paper we would only publish ddois that are in hipparcos catalogs , and consequently do have spectral types inferred from color and parallax , as a test of our pipeline .",
    "sptclass calculates spectral types of stars using spectral indices , comparing line fluxes of spectral features that are sensitive to effective temperature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and others ) .",
    "sptclass uses three independent spectral typing modules : indices characterizing early ( oba , 44 indices ) , intermediate ( fg , 11 indices ) , and late ( km , 16 indices ) spectral types .",
    "each index is based on the equivalent width for the spectral feature , which is calculated by measuring the decrease in flux from the expected continuum due to line absorption .",
    "indices measured by this procedure are generally insensitive to reddening , so long as each band s wavelength coverage is relatively small .",
    "the indices have been calibrated as a function of spectral type using o8-m6 main sequence standards ; this large extent for all indices ensures that degeneracy of determination is eliminated .",

    "the b1e star hd 7406 has additional strong he  i absorption lines ; we detect weak he  i absorption in the other stars .",
    "our high s / n spectra reveal no trace of other permitted or forbidden emission lines , confirming our classification of them as classical be stars rather than pre - main sequence herbig ae / be stars .",
    "these stars illustrate the promise of disk detective for identifying new classical be stars .",
    "although be stars have large infrared excesses due to free - free emission , most have been identified from optical spectroscopic surveys optical photometric surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ir spectroscopic surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "there are three known planetary systems with white dwarfs as distant companions : gl 86 , hd 27442 , and hd 147513",
    ". however , the hd 74389 system appears to contain the first debris disk around a star with a white dwarf companion .",
    "the white dwarf companion , hd 74389 b , has v mag 14.62 , and is located 20.11 arcsec to the west @xcite .",
    "it is readily visible in the dss blue , red and ir images .",
    "these bands also show a background object @xmath283 to the north of the star , possibly the m dwarf companion reported by @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to ponder the origin of the disk around hd 74389 a and how the post - main sequence evolution of hd 74389 b may have affected it .",
    "though the white dwarf may presently have a projected separation of 2230 au , it could have been 2 - 4@xmath284 closer in when it was on the main sequence , thanks to stellar mass loss .",
    "the disk may have merely survived the evolution of the higher - mass star , or it may represent a signature of dynamical changes to the system , like planet exchange ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it could even have been built from mass loss by the companion , via the process described by @xcite .",
    "we have outlined and demonstrated a novel process for identifying new candidate circumstellar disks in the wise survey data .",
    "this paper reports only results from the first 10% of the search , so it might be premature to try to derive any statistically meaningful inferences about the population of debris disk from this limited sample .",
    "but our list of 37 new , well - vetted disk candidates demonstrates the utility of crowdsourcing analysis of wise images .",
    "one of our disk candidate systems appears to contain the first debris disk discovered around a star with a white dwarf companion : hd 74389 .",
    "we also report four newly discovered classical be stars ( hd 6612 , hd 7406 , hd 164137 , and hd 218546 ) and a new detection of 22 @xmath0 m excess around previously known debris disk host star hd 22128 .",
    "we decided to only publish in this paper candidates that are in the hipparcos catalog .",
    "since the @xcite cross - correlated the wise archive with the hipparcos catalog , they could conceivably have identified all of the candidates that we are announcing .",
    "however , @xcite used a [ 2mass ] - [ w4 ] color criterion , as opposed to our [ w1 ] - [ w4 ] color criterion , and used the wise allsky data rather than the wise allwise data .",
    "yet all of the candidates presented in this paper would have also been selected by the @xcite color criterion .",
    "more importantly , while we examined candidates by eye to discard objects potentially contaminated by nearby stars and galaxies , @xcite used a statistical likelihood - ratio ( lr ) technique to accomplish this goal .",
    "perhaps their statistical technique was more conservative than our more labor intensive approach , leaving these candidates unidentified .",
    "we have several further improvements to disk detective project underway , which we will describe in upcoming papers , including :    * new ways to retire the sources after fewer classifications .",
    "* spectroscopy of southern hemisphere ddois via the casleo telescope in argentina * imaging follow - up of ddois with the robo - ao @xcite instrument at the palomar observatory 60-inch telescope to check for background contaminants located closer to the star than dss can probe .    with its high sensitivity and angular resolution in the mid - infrared",
