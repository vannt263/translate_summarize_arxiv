    "the nonlocality feature of quantum mechanics ( qm ) , as discovered by john bell in his work `` on the einstein  podolsky  rosen paradox '' ( epr)@xcite , does not conflict with einstein s relativity , thus it can not be used for superluminal communication . nevertheless , bell s celebrated work@xcite initiated new physics , like quantum cryptography@xcite and quantum teleportation@xcite , and it triggered a new technology : quantum information and quantum communication@xcite .",
    "more about `` from bell to quantum information '' can be found in the book@xcite .    of course , it is of great interest to investigate the epr  bell correlations of measurements also for massive systems in particle physics ( for a review see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "one of the most exciting systems is the `` strange '' @xmath3 system in a @xmath4 state@xcite , where the quantum number _ strangeness _ @xmath5 plays the role of spin @xmath6 and @xmath7 of spin@xmath1 particles or of polarization @xmath8 and @xmath9 of photons .",
    "in fact , in comparison to quantum information the kaon can be considered as a `` kaonic qubit''@xcite but due to its specific internal particle properties ( particle  antiparticle oscillation and decay characteristics , symmetry violation ) additional fundamental quantum features not occurring in photon systems are seen .",
    "several authors@xcite suggested already to investigate the @xmath10 pairs which are produced at the @xmath0 resonance , for instance in the @xmath11machine da@xmath0ne at frascati .",
    "there is the great chance to test many different aspects of qm , for instance , bell inequalities and decoherence models ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) , the quantum eraser phenomenon@xcite and symmetry violation@xcite . in particular , local realistic theories ( lrt ) have been constructed , which describe the @xmath10 pairs , as tests versus quantum mechanics@xcite .",
    "however , a general test of lrt versus qm is usually performed via bell inequalities , where as we shall see we have more options .",
    "we may choose either different `` quasi  spins '' of the kaon or different kaon detection times ( or both ) ; they play the role of the different angles in the photon or spin@xmath1 case . due to the kaon decay we have in addition to the _ active _ measurement procedure the _ passive _ measurement .",
    "furthermore , an interesting feature of kaons is @xmath2 violation in the mixing of particle  antiparticle and indeed it is related to the violation of bell inequalities .    besides the kaon system which is an ideal tool to test the amazing features of qm , there is the @xmath12 system which is produced to an enormous amount at the asymmetric @xmath13factories at kek - b@xcite and at pep - ii@xcite .",
    "a bell inequality ( bi ) for this system@xcite faces , however , with difficulties so that it can not be considered as a bell test refuting local realism .",
    "the two main drawbacks are : firstly , `` active '' measurements a necessary requirement for the validity of a bi are missing , therefore one can construct a local realistic model ; and secondly , the unitary time evolution of the unstable quantum state the decay property of the meson , which is part of its nature has been ignored ( for more detailed criticism , see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath12 events , the asymmetry of like and unlike  flavor events for several different times , at kek - b@xcite are ideal to test the validity of the quantum mechanical wavefunction or to confirm the corresponding time dependence of possible decoherence effects , see refs.@xcite .    finally , we want to mention quite different attempts to test qm versus lrt , these are the positron annihilation experiments@xcite , the proton  proton scattering experiments@xcite and the @xmath14@xcite and @xmath15 pair productions@xcite . unfortunately , all these reactions suffer by loopholes and are not conclusive as bell tests ( for a detailed discussion , see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "kaons are fantastic quantum systems , we could even say they are selected by nature to demonstrate fundamental quantum principles such as :    * superposition principle * oscillation and decay property * quasi - spin property .    let us focus on the quantum features which we need in our discussion .",
    "quantum  mechanically we can describe the kaons in the following way .",
    "kaons are characterized by their _ strangeness _ quantum number @xmath16 @xmath17 and the combined operation @xmath2 gives @xmath18 it is straightforward to construct the @xmath2 eigenstates @xmath19 a quantum number conserved in strong interactions @xmath20    however , due to weak interactions @xmath2 symmetry is _ violated _ and the kaons decay in physical states , the short and long  lived states , @xmath21 , which differ slightly in mass , @xmath22 ev , but immensely in their lifetimes and decay modes @xmath23 the weights @xmath24 , @xmath25 with @xmath26 contain the complex @xmath2 _ violating parameter _ @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 _ invariance _ is assumed .",
    "the short  lived k  meson decays dominantly into @xmath30 with a width or lifetime @xmath31 s and the long  lived k  meson decays dominantly into @xmath32 with @xmath33 s. however , due to @xmath2 violation we observe a small amount @xmath34 .    in this description the superpositions ( [ k1k2 ] ) and ( [ kaonsl ] ) or quite generally any vector in the 2dimensional complex hilbert space of kaons represent kaonic qubit states in analogy to the qubit states in quantum information .",
    "@xmath35 are eigenstates of a non  hermitian `` effective mass '' hamiltonian @xmath36 satisfying @xmath37 both mesons @xmath38 and @xmath39 have transitions to common states ( due to @xmath2 violation ) therefore they mix , that means they _ oscillate _ between @xmath38 and @xmath40 before decaying . since the decaying states evolve according to the wigner ",
    "weisskopf approximation exponentially in time latexmath:[\\[\\label{wigner -- weisskopf }    the subsequent time evolution for @xmath38 and @xmath39 is given by @xmath42 with @xmath43 \\;.\\ ] ] supposing that a @xmath38 beam is produced at @xmath44 , e.g. by strong interactions , then the probability for finding a @xmath38 or @xmath39 in the beam is calculated to be @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath38 beam oscillates with frequency @xmath48 , where @xmath49 .",
    "the oscillation is clearly visible at times of the order of a few @xmath50 , before all @xmath51 s have died out leaving only the @xmath52 s in the beam .",
    "so in a beam which contains only @xmath38 mesons at the beginning @xmath44 there will occur @xmath39 far from the production source through its presence in the @xmath52 meson .      in comparison with spin@xmath1 particles , or with photons having the polarization directions v ( vertical ) and h ( horizontal )",
    ", it is very instructive to characterize the kaons by a _ quasi  spin _ ( for details see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "we can regard the two states @xmath53 and @xmath54 as the quasi ",
    "spin states up @xmath55 and down @xmath56 and can express the operators acting in this quasi ",
    "spin space by pauli matrices .",
    "so we identify the strangeness operator @xmath57 with the pauli matrix @xmath58 , the @xmath2 operator with ( @xmath59 ) and for describing @xmath2 violation we also need @xmath60 .",
    "in fact , the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) then has the form @xmath61 with @xmath62 and the angle @xmath63 is related to the @xmath2 violating parameter @xmath27 by @xmath64    summarizing , we have the following kaonic  photonic analogy :     @xmath65 * * quasi  spin**@xmath65 & * photon * + @xmath66 & @xmath67 & @xmath68 + @xmath69 & @xmath70 & @xmath71 + @xmath72 & @xmath73 & @xmath74 + @xmath75 & @xmath76 & @xmath77 + @xmath78 & @xmath79 & @xmath80 + @xmath81 & @xmath82 & @xmath83 +    a good _ optical analogy _ to the phenomenon of strangeness oscillation can be achieved by using the physical effect of birefringence in optical fibers which leads to the rotation of polarization directions .",
    "thus @xmath9 ( horizontal ) polarized light is rotated after some distance into @xmath8 ( vertical ) polarized light , and so on . on the other hand , the decay of kaons can be simulated by polarization dependent losses in optical fibres , where one state has lower losses than its orthogonal state@xcite . +   +",
    "the description of kaons as qubits reveals close analogies to photons but also deep physical differences .",
    "kaons oscillate , they are massive , they decay and can be characterized by symmetries like @xmath2 .",
    "even though some kaon features , like oscillation and decay , can be mimicked by photon experiments ( see ref.@xcite ) ,",
    "they are inherently different since they are intrinsic properties of the kaon given by nature",
    ".      for neutral kaons there exist two physical alternative bases , accordingly we have two observables for the kaons , namely the projectors to the two bases .",
    "the first basis is the strangeness eigenstate basis @xmath84 , it can be measured by inserting along the kaon trajectory a piece of ordinary matter , which corresponds to an _ active _ measurement of strangeness . due to strangeness conservation of the strong interactions the incoming state",
    "is projected either onto @xmath38 by @xmath85 or onto @xmath39 by @xmath86 , @xmath87 or @xmath88 .",
    "here nucleonic matter plays the same role as a two channel analyzer for polarized photon beams .",
    "alternatively , the strangeness content of neutral kaons can be determined by observing their semileptonic decay modes , eq.([semileptonic - decays ] ) .    obviously , the experimenter has no control of the kaon decay , neither of the mode nor of the time .",
    "the experimenter can only sort at the end of the day all observed events in proper decay modes and time intervals .",
    "we call this procedure opposite to the _ active _ measurement described above a _ passive _ measurement procedure of strangeness .    the second basis @xmath89 consists of the short and long  lived states having well defined masses @xmath90 and decay widths @xmath91 .",
    "we have seen that it is the appropriate basis to discuss the kaon propagation in free space , because these states preserve their own identity in time , eq.([wigner  weisskopf ] ) . due to the huge difference in the decay widths the @xmath51 s decay much faster than the @xmath52 s .",
    "thus in order to observe if a propagating kaon is a @xmath51 or @xmath52 at an instant time @xmath92 , one has to detect at which time it subsequently decays .",
    "kaons which are observed to decay before @xmath93 have to be identified as @xmath51 s , while those surviving after this time are assumed to be @xmath52 s .",
    "misidentifications reduce only to a few parts in @xmath94 ( see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "note that the experimenter does nt care about the specific decay mode , she / he records only a decay event at a certain time .",
    "we call this procedure an _ active _ measurement of lifetime .    since the neutral kaon system violates the @xmath2 symmetry ( recall section [ k - quantumstates ] ) the mass eigenstates are not strictly orthogonal , @xmath95",
    ". however , neglecting @xmath2 violation remember it is of the order of @xmath94 the @xmath51 s are identified by a @xmath96 final state and @xmath52 s by a @xmath97 final state .",
    "we call this procedure a _ passive _ measurement of lifetime , since the kaon decay times and decay channels used in the measurement are entirely determined by the quantum nature of kaons and can not be in any way influenced by the experimenter .",
    "it is assumed that _ active _ and _ passive _ measurements have the same amount of misidentifications .",
    "+ the important message for testing bell inequalities which we are going to discuss in the next section is :    * the _ active _ measurement procedures are a necessary requirement for the validity of a bi .",
    "having discussed kaons as qubit states and their analogy to photons we consider next two qubit states .",
    "a two qubit system of kaons is a general superposition of the 4 states , @xmath98 .",
    "interestingly , also for strange mesons entangled states can be obtained , in analogy to the entangled spin up and down pairs , or h and v polarized photon pairs .",
    "such states are produced by @xmath11colliders through the reaction @xmath99 , in particular at da@xmath0ne in frascati , or they are produced in @xmath100collisions , like , e.g. , at lear at cern@xcite .",
    "there , a @xmath10 pair is created in a @xmath4 quantum state and thus antisymmetric under @xmath101 and @xmath102 , and is described at the time @xmath44 by the entangled state @xmath103 with @xmath104 , in complete analogy to the entangled photon case @xmath105 the neutral kaons fly apart and are detected on the left ( @xmath106 ) and right ( @xmath107 ) hand side of the source . of course ,",
    "during their propagation the @xmath10 pairs oscillate and the @xmath35 states decay .",
    "this is an important difference to the case of photons which are stable .",
    "let us measure _ actively _ at time @xmath108 a @xmath38 meson on the left hand side and at time @xmath109 a @xmath38 or a @xmath39 on the right hand side then we find an epr  bell correlation analogously to the entangled photon case with polarization v  v or v  h . assuming for simplicity stable kaons ( @xmath110 ) then we get the following result for the quantum probabilities @xmath111 which is the analogy to the probabilities of finding simultaneously two entangled photons along two chosen directions @xmath112 and @xmath113 @xmath114 thus we observe a _",
    "perfect analogy _ between times @xmath115 and angles @xmath116 .",
    "+ alternatively , we also can fix the time and vary the quasi ",
    "spin of the kaon , which corresponds to a rotation in quasi ",
    "spin space analogously to the rotation of polarization of the photon @xmath117    note that the weights @xmath118 are not independent and not all kaonic superpositions are realized in nature in contrast to photons .",
    "depicting the kaonic ",
    "photonic analogy we have :      consequently , for establishing a bi for kaons we have the option :    1 .   varying the quasi  spin  fixing time 2 .   fixing the quasi  spin  varying time .",

    "optimizing the inequality we can convert ( [ uchiyamabi ] ) into an inequality for the complex kaon transition coefficients @xmath128 @xmath129 ) is _ experimentally testable _ !",

    "let us consider the semileptonic decays of the kaons .",

    "experimentally , however , the asymmetry is nonvanishing@xcite @xmath143 what we find is that bound ( [ inequaldelta ] ) , dictated by bi ( [ uchiyamabi ] ) , is in contradiction to the experimental value ( [ deltaexp ] ) which is definitely positive .    on the other hand",
    ", we can replace @xmath39 by @xmath38 in the bi ( [ uchiyamabi ] ) and obtain the reversed inequality @xmath144 so that respecting all possible bi s leads to strict equality @xmath145 , @xmath2 conservation , in contradiction to experiment .",
    "+ _ conclusion _ : the premises of lrt are _ only _ compatible with strict @xmath2 conservation in @xmath10 mixing .",
    "conversely , @xmath2 violation in @xmath10 mixing , no matter which sign the experimental asymmetry ( [ asymlept ] ) actually has , always leads to a _",

    "kaons are ideal objects to test the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics , in particular the entanglement or nonlocality properties of kaon pairs , which are of great interest in connection with the physics of quantum communication and quantum information .",
    "in fact , in analogy to polarized photons the kaons can be considered as qubits as well but due to their internal symmetries and time evolution they exhibit further exciting features as compared to photons .",
    "one is that the violation of @xmath2 symmetry in the mixing of @xmath10 leads to a violation of a bell inequality for quasi ",
    "spin variation refuting in consequence any local realistic theory .",
    "another feature is that bell inequalities for time variations are due to the unitary time evolution which includes the decay states much more sophisticated than in the photon case .",

    "this nonlocal state is not maximally entangled and shows therefore the difference of the conceptions nonlocality and entanglement .",
