    "the structure of neutron penumbral imaging system is shown in fig.[fig : penumbral ] . the source , aperture and detector composed the whole imaging system .",
    "the fast neutrons emitting from a burning target are scattered by the aperture materials , and form an penumbral image on the detector arrays . in our simulation the coded aperture is placed at @xmath1 from the source , the detector is placed at @xmath2 from the aperture . the aperture is designed as a @xmath3 thick @xmath4 diameter(tungsten ) cylinder to achieve an effective absorption of the @xmath5 neutrons in the opaque parts of the aperture . the pattern of the aperture is a disk ( penumbra ) which consists in a biconical hole , the diameters @xmath6 of the biconical hole are @xmath7 .",
    "an enlarged coded image is projected on the neutron detector which is placed on the target bay floor , at @xmath8 from the aperture .",
    "the image obtained from the detector is a convolution of the source spatial distribution with the aperture transfer function .",
    "[ fig : penumbral ]    in the fig.[fig : penumbral ] only the red annular of the coded image contains the effective information of the source shape changing . to achieve the high snr",
    "we can place a plug inside the hole of an aperture of the same dimensions as the penumbra(fig.[fig : penumbral ] ) to define a annular , which will be study in another paper .",
    "this pattern can shield a lot of background but also face the alignment tolerance problem and not enough neutron can be detected .",
    "the neutron detector is composed of @xmath9 array of scintillating fibers fig.[fig : fiberarraysection ] .",
    "each scintillating fiber can be realized as a sub - detector , the structure was designed as the left figure of fig.[fig : fiberarraysection ] .",
    "the core part is a tubes of @xmath10 diameter and the material is polystyrene bcf-10 ( molecular formula c6h5ch = ch2 , @xmath11 )",
    ". 14 mev neutrons mainly interact by elastic scattering on hydrogen nuclei inside the fibers .",
    "as they lose kinetic energy , the recoil protons will produce light , a part of the light is guided through these fibers . outside",
    "the core part is a layer of the clad material , which is used to avoid the scintillating light interaction in the array of scintillating fibers .",
    "the material of the envelope is polyvinyl alcohol(molecular formula ch2=choh , @xmath12 ) and the thickness is @xmath13 .",
    "an optical relay then casts the scintillating light from the end of the array to an image intensifier tube ( iit ) which gates the 14 mev neutrons at their arrival time on the detector .",
    "the image is then reduced with a fibered optical taper onto a ccd .",
    "[ fig : fiberarraysection ]    overall spatial resolution of the system for both the annular and the penumbral apertures is the same , which is determined by the point spread functions ( psf ) of the coded aperture and detector resolution ( @xmath14 ) scaled down the source plane as equation [ eq : resolution ] . in the paraxial approximation ,",
    "the broadening of the apertures point spread function is identical , determined by the fov and the aperture to target distance ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "@xmath16 where @xmath17 is the attenuation of the neutrons in tungsten and @xmath18 is the detector to the target distance . with this design ,",
    "the overall spatial resolution of the system is about 20 @xmath19 in source plane .    in the geant4 simulation we used the physics list qgsp_bert_hp which contains the high precision neutron package ( neutronhp ) to simulate the process of neutrons transportation with the energy below 20 mev down to thermal energies .",
    "the physical process neutron capture , fission , elastic and inelastic scattering ( including absorption ) are treated by referring to the endf - b vi cross - section data . besides , in the ref@xcite has demonstrated the validity of geant4 calculations in neutron generation and transportation which is the same as mcnp .",
    "moreover , object - oriented programming and highly sophisticated processing of both electromagnetic interactions and ionization processes enhance geant4 capabilities for the study of mixed fields and complicated geometries .    in the icf experiment the neutrons generated by hot spot spread in whole space .",
    "the idealized aperture only allow the neutrons in the solid angle as fig.[fig : penumbral ] to deposit the energy on the detector .",
    "but actually because the neutrons have the high ability to penetrate the start part of the aperture , and also the neutrons will scatter with the wall of the aperture , these neutrons which hit the detector will become the background of the imaging . to simulate the complete imaging process and also save the calculation time we ask the program only generate random distribution neutron in the cone with @xmath20 radius as fig.[fig : penumbral - simulate ] . as equation [ eq : simulate - approximate3 ] @xmath20 is determined by @xmath21 which is the width of the detector project on the front face of the aperture .",
    "with this design there are about one half of the events be scattered by the penumbral aperture.to get the high statistic sample we simulated @xmath22 effective events of penumbral imaging .",
    "[ fig : penumbral - simulate ]    @xmath23",
    "at present , there are a lot of reconstruction methods have been developed . among them",
    "the simplest and quickest method is wiener filter method , which is a linear reconstruction method .",
    "as we can not get prior knowledge of the signal - noise ratio , wiener filter method can not get good results .",
    "therefore we can use this method as the reference or use the result as the input of some nonlinear reconstruction method . in these years",
    "there are some nonlinear reconstruct methods have been introduced to reconstruct penumbral image such as genetic algorithm and heuristic algorithm proposed by chen et al.@xcite , and the classical molecular dynamics reconstruction method proposed by liu et al.@xcite ,    in the experiment l. disdier et al . had successfully used the filtered autocorrelation technique@xcite to get @xmath0 resolution reconstruction image from the penumbral imaging system with @xmath24 theoritical resolution . filtered autocorrelation technique is different from other method which do nt need to rely on the simulation psf in the reconstruction .",
    "another nonlinear method lucy - rechardson algorithm@xcite has been successfully used on x - ray ring coded imaging in experiment@xcite . and",
    "this algorithm has been most widely used for restoring images with noise from counting statistics and the data approximate poisson statistics . in this program",
    "we first try to use the lucy - rechardson method to get reconstructed image .",
    "the process of the imaging can be described as a spatial intensity distribution @xmath25 convolved by a neutron source spatial intensity distribution @xmath26 with a point spread function ( psf ) @xmath27 .",
    "add the noise @xmath28 the detector image can be expressed as @xmath29    lucy - rechardson algorithm is an iterative method .",
    "based on the reference@xcite , the decode formulation can be expressed as [ eq - reco1 ] .",
    "where psf(h ) and image on detector(g ) come from the simulation , the reconstructed image(f ) can be extracted after k times iterate .",

    "<S> the process of icf can be divided into four steps as fig [ fig : icf ] : first step generate radiation to drive implosion . </S>",
    "<S> there are two approaches to drive implosion , one is laser direct driven , another is laser energy injected inside the cavity generates x - rays that heat the dt fuel . under x - ray or laser compression , the target density as well as the mean ions temperature increases . </S>",
    "<S> fusion reactions will occur within a hot spot generating 14 mev neutrons and alpha particles@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the density is sufficient to trap the energetic alphas or other radiation , these energy will be deposited on the surrounding cold dt medium . </S>",
    "<S> then the chained thermonuclear reactions will lead to a combustion in the compressed target . </S>",
    "<S> for a well compressed target , combustion will last long enough to generate more energy than the injected energy . </S>",
    "<S> if ever , drive symmetry is poor or pulse shaping is imprecise , burning will be low . </S>",
    "<S> so we can use the neutrons escaped from the compressed cores of target to study the compressed process to make sure the drive be symmetrical .    </S>",
    "<S> there are several neutron imaging techniques for inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) experiment to detect the size , shape , and uniformity of the compressed cores . </S>",
    "<S> the pinhole imaging is the easiest way , but the low neutron yield has an effect on the sensitivity . in nif experiment a pinhole array is designed to increase the sensitivity@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the another technique is the neutron penumbral imaging ( npi ) , which have been widely studied by lmj@xcite and other groups @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> compared with other neutron imaging techniques , the sensitivity of neutron penumbral imaging is higher . </S>",
    "<S> annular imaging is nearly the same as penumbral imaging , the only difference of the imaging process is aperture .                    </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : icf ]    in this paper we just based on the simulation model in the reference@xcite to design a software package ngpinex which can be used to simulate the neutron imaging process and recovery the coded image . </S>",
    "<S> the imaging process simulation have been described in geant4 , and then the recover algorithm we used lucy - richardson method@xcite , which have been successfully applied on decoding x - ray ring code image@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the whole program is written in c++ , which can be run under the linux system with multi - core server .    in the program we simulated neutron penumbral imaging and annular imaging , the pinhole imaging block is also included in the program . </S>",
    "<S> based on the nif and lmj experiment we design an imaging system aimming to achieve @xmath0 resolution . </S>",
