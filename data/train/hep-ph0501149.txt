    "we consider the scattering of a dipole of size @xmath0 off a target @xmath1-dipole of size @xmath2 as a toy model for high energy scattering . in the qcd parton model and in the rest frame of the target",
    ", the projectile interacts through one of its quantum fluctuations @xmath3 which are produced by qcd radiation . at high energy ,",
    "these fluctuations are dominated by dense gluonic states , generically called `` color glass condensate '' @xcite .",
    "it proves useful to view the partonic configurations as collections of color dipoles @xcite characterized by their transverse sizes @xmath4 .",
    "each of these dipoles may interact with the target according to the elementary amplitude @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the total amplitude for a given fock state realization reads @xmath8 roughly speaking , @xmath9 is counting the number of dipoles within a bin of size 1 centered around @xmath10 , with a weight given by the interaction strength @xmath11 .",
    "let us describe the rapidity evolution of a given fock state .",
    "an increase of the rapidity of the projectile opens up the phase space for each dipole to split into two new dipoles ( this is the dipole interpretation of gluon branching ) .",
    "the probability of such a splitting to occur is given by the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) kernel .",
    "the typical partonic configurations that drive the high energy evolution are those for which the newly created dipoles have sizes of the order of the size of their parent dipole .",
    "this means that the parton density grows essentially diffusively under rapidity evolution .",
    "the above picture is valid provided the interaction is not too strong , i.e. as long as @xmath12 . in the bins where the number of partons gets large and @xmath9 reaches  1 , eq .",
    "( [ linear ] ) and the rapidity evolution itself are supplemented by nonlinear terms which tame the growth of @xmath9 in such a way that the unitarity bound @xmath13 be respected . at that point ,",
    "the dipole picture itself breaks down .",
    "the exact mechanism of how unitarization is realized ( which involves gluon recombinations and multiple scatterings ) is still not fully understood , but such information is not required to get most of the properties of the amplitude , see eqs .",
    "( [ satscale2],[amp2 ] ) .",
    "the picture of high energy scattering that we have just outlined is essentially that of a reaction - diffusion process in a system made of @xmath14 particles @xcite .",
    "so far , we have being focussing on one particular fock state realization , which corresponds to one given event in an experiment .",
    "the amplitude @xmath9 is the scattering amplitude for that given partonic state , which obviously is not an observable since partonic configurations are random and can not be selected experimentally .",
    "the physical amplitude is the average of @xmath9 over all partonic configurations accessible at rapidity  @xmath15 : @xmath16 in the following sections , we will study the properties of @xmath17 that can be deduced from our reaction - diffusion picture .",
    "as a first step , we enforce a mean field approximation by neglecting the fluctuations of @xmath9 ( which are due to statistical fluctuations in the dipole number ) , in which case @xmath18 . the rapidity evolution of @xmath17 is well - understood in this approximation : it is given by the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite , which was recently shown to belong to the universality class of the fisher - kolmogorov - petrovsky - piscounov ( fkpp ) equation @xcite .",
    "the latter reads @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "the first two terms in the right handside stand for the growing diffusion of the partons , while the last nonlinear term tames this growth so that @xmath17 complies with the unitarity limit .",
    "while the exact mapping between the bk and the fkpp equations  ( [ fkpp ] ) has not been exhibited , the universality class was unambiguously identified  @xcite . from the properties of the solutions of equations belonging to that class",
    ", it became clear that the two equations have the same large-@xmath15 asymptotics , up to the replacement of the few parameters that characterize the diffusive growth , and that have to be taken from the bfkl kernel in the case of qcd .",
    "the fkpp equation admits asymptotic traveling waves ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , namely at large rapidity , @xmath17 boils down to a function of a single variable @xmath21 where the momentum @xmath22 is called the saturation scale and is defined , for example , by the requirement that @xmath23 be some predefined number @xmath24 .",
    "the scaling law  ( [ amp1 ] ) is known as `` geometric scaling '' @xcite .",
    "the rapidity dependence of @xmath22 was found to be @xcite @xmath25 where we have put back the parameters derived from the bfkl kernel @xmath26 .",
    "the last equation in  ( [ satscale1 ] ) defines @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "( [ satscale1 ] ) captures the leading-@xmath15 behavior : two further subleading terms have been obtained recently @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic form of the amplitude is also known for @xmath28 @xcite , as well as the first corrections to the scaling  ( [ amp1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "a very important property is that @xmath29 is completely determined by the small-@xmath17 tail which drives the evolution of the whole front .",
    "the mean field description outlined above is justified when the number of dipoles of a given size is large . however , in regions in which the amplitude @xmath9 is of order @xmath11 , the statistical fluctuations dominate and the mean field approximation breaks down .",
    "both the fact that the number of dipoles of a given size is finite , and that this number fluctuates from event to event resulting in fluctuations @xmath30 , are neglected in the mean field description  ( [ fkpp ] ) .",
    "since the tail @xmath12 determines @xmath22 , we anticipate that these features have dramatic consequences .",
    "an evolution equation corrected for these effects may be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a gaussian white noise . with respect to eq .",
    "( [ fkpp ] ) , we have added a noise term that accounts for the statistical fluctuations in the dipole number .",
    "( [ sfkpp ] ) is the stochastic fisher - kolmogorov ( sfkpp ) equation .",
    "significant progress has been achieved in the last few years in understanding the properties of its solutions @xcite .",
    "it has been realized that the discreteness of the number of dipoles induces large corrections to the saturation scale , namely @xcite @xmath33 on the other hand , the fluctuations in the dipole number result in a diffusive wandering of the saturation scale : different events have saturation scales which typically differ by @xmath34 ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for a reaction - diffusion model that shares the essential properties of the full qcd problem ( note that @xmath35 , therefore statistical fluctuations in the tail are not distinguishable on the plot ) .",
    "after having averaged over many events to get the physical amplitude  ( [ physamp ] ) , the wandering of the saturation scale causes a drastic breaking of geometric scaling .",
    "the variance of the wandering of the front has recently been quantified @xcite , and this result enables us to derive the scaling law for @xmath17 @xcite that replaces geometric scaling  ( [ amp1 ] ) : @xmath36    very recent work @xcite has aimed at matching these ideas with the so - called balitsky - jalilian - marian - iancu - mclerran - weigert - leonidov - kovner ( jimwlk ) formulation of the color glass condensate @xcite , at the expense of a modification of the latter .",
    "we should stress that in any case , the results  ( [ satscale2],[amp2 ] ) directly stem from the physics of the parton model , and are presumably exact solutions of qcd : they are the leading terms in a large-@xmath15 and small-@xmath37 expansion .",
