    "invasion fronts play an important organizing role in spatially extended systems , with applications ranging from ecology to material science .",
    "they arise when a system is quenched into an unstable state and spatially localized fluctuations drive the system away into a more stable state . in an idealized situation ,",
    "fluctuations are reduced to one small localized perturbation of the initial state .",
    "such an initial disturbance then grows and spreads spatially , leaving behind a new state of the system @xcite .",
    "beyond such an idealized scenario , one might expect that localization of fluctuations is quite unlikely in a large system .",
    "the mechanism of a spatially spreading disturbance is however still relevant , at least for the description of transients , when initial disturbances are localized at several well separated locations in physical space @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "in particular for problems in ecology , unstable states prevail over large parts of space without disturbance because invasive species are simply absent in most of the domain , and spreading of the invasion is mediated by slow diffusive motion combined with exponential growth @xcite . in general , localization of disturbances",
    "can be achieved systematically when the system is quenched into an unstable state in a spatially uniformly progressing way , a scenario particularly relevant in a number of engineering applications @xcite .",
    "conceptually , one is interested in two aspects of the invasion process :    1 .   what is the invasion speed ?",
    "2 .   what is the state in the wake selected by the invasion process ?    the first question is most natural in ecological contexts while the second question occurs naturally in manufacturing and engineering @xcite applications",
    ". both questions are clearly intimately related .",
    "one may envision , for instance , that different invasion speeds are associated with different possible states in the wake of the front and , in a simple scenario of almost linear superposition , the state in the wake of a primary invasion would be the fastest spreading state .",
    "the present work focuses mostly on the first question , while pointing out in some situations the intimate connection with the second aspect .    in many simple , mostly scalar contexts , invasion speeds",
    "are well defined and can be characterized in various fashions , for instance using generalized eigenvalue problems or min - max principles @xcite . the key ingredient to almost all those characterizations is an order preservation property of the nonlinear evolution of the system .",
    "while very effective when available , such a property is intrinsically violated whenever we are interested in pattern - forming systems .    in a somewhat less comprehensive and less rigorous fashion , spreading speeds have been known to be related to concepts of absolute and convective instability .",
    "invasion speeds are characterized as critical states : an observer traveling at the spreading speed observes a marginally stable system @xcite .",
    "this characterization originates in the theory of absolute and convective instability , motivated originally by studies of plasma instabilities @xcite with many applications in fluid dynamics @xcite . without striving to give a comprehensive ( or even adequate ) review of the relevant literature , we will pursue this approach in a systematic fashion . trying to press some folklore observations into precise lemmas",
    ", we uncover a number of apparently unknown ( or at least under - appreciated ) aspects of convective and absolute instabilities , which directly impact the characterization of spreading speeds .    as a general rule ,",
    "the analysis here is linear , but intrinsically motivated by the desire to derive criteria and consequences for nonlinear invasion processes . beyond providing a precise language for the mathematically inclined reader interested in this approach to invasion problems",
    ", we point to several interesting phenomena that deserve further exploration . in particular , we highlight two main results of this work :    [ [ multiple - spreading - modes . ] ] multiple spreading modes .",

    "as opposed to ( one - sided ) pointwise growth modes , they are however continuous with respect to system parameters . from an algorithmic point of view , one can compute double roots ( dr ) , then specialize to pinched double roots , and finally check on the presence of pointwise and right - sided pointwise growth modes ; we refer to @xcite for computational aspects of the first steps in this procedure .",
    "we gave a number of examples that highlight the difference between these concepts .",
    "a key role was played by the example of counter - propagating waves ( cpw ) , @xmath718 the following table summarizes some of our results , listing existence of growth modes or pinched double roots at @xmath181 in the examples , as well as continuity , semi - continuity , and availability ( and continuity ) of counts .       in most examples that we have encountered ,",
    "double roots appear to be most amenable to explicit analysis",
    ". the pinching condition can be more cumbersome to analyze .",
    "pointwise growth modes and right - sided pointwise growth modes need only be computed in the non - generic cases when multiple double roots determine growth . in such cases , one can focus on a _ local _ analysis near the pinched double root and compute @xmath138 or @xmath77 , which can then often be split in singular and non - singular subspaces @xmath719 , @xmath720 analytic .    based on pinched double roots , we defined spreading speeds as maximal speeds of comoving frames with marginally stable pinched double roots .",
    "we do not know if pointwise growth modes or right - sided pointwise growth modes are continuous with respect to changes in the laboratory frame . as a consequence",
    ", a definition of spreading speeds based on these more subtle concepts would be less workable at this point .    as an application , we studied linear spreading speeds in two - dimensional domains , depending on a transverse wavenumber .",
    "we showed that linearly determined , transversely planar , non - modulated fronts are always fastest .",
    "we do not have a simple intuitive explanation of this fact .",

    "analyticity properties of the green s function @xmath724 are independent of @xmath725 .",

    "this can be readily seen using floquet theory , which transforms the @xmath588-periodic linear differential equation into a constant - coefficient system via an @xmath588-dependent change of variables .",
    "one can also define an analytic dispersion relation via @xmath727 continuity results carry over , but counts do not apply since the dispersion relation is not polynomial .",
    "in fact , there are typically infinitely many double roots .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a discussion of pointwise growth and double roots in this context .",
    "periodic coefficients arise for instance when studying secondary invasion . as we saw in section [ s : spmult ] , primary pattern - forming invasion typically creates one - dimensional stripes parallel to the front interface .",
    "often these striped patterns are unstable and a secondary invasion process will create more complex patterns such as squares and hexagons .",
    "this secondary invasion process can to some approximation be studied using the linearization at the primary , unstable striped pattern . of course",
    ", the linearization at this striped pattern will not be isotropic , even if the underlying equation is , so that one may now observe transversely modulated fronts .    beyond periodic coefficients , generalizations to quasi - periodic and random media",
    "have been studied , mostly in scalar equations .",
    "we refer to @xcite and references therein without attempting a generalization of our concepts in this direction .      also of interest are situations where @xmath728 is heteroclinic ( or homoclinic when @xmath729 ) . to some extent",
    ", this case has been studied extensively in the context of stability problems of nonlinear waves using the evans function ; see for instance @xcite .",
    "the relation with pointwise growth becomes apparent in this context when extending evans functions across the essential spectrum using the gap lemma . in the context of pointwise stability ,",
    "our discussion here is similar to @xcite .",
    "associated with @xmath730 , we consider the subspaces @xmath77 , associated with @xmath731 we consider @xmath78 .",
    "for @xmath732 , these subspaces contain bounded solutions on @xmath220 and @xmath233 , respectively , to the first - order equations @xmath733 associated with @xmath734 .",
    "assuming sufficiently rapid convergence in @xmath588 , the @xmath588-dependent problem possesses subspaces @xmath735 that contain initial conditions to bounded solutions on @xmath220 and @xmath233 , respectively , for the @xmath588-dependent problem @xmath736 .",
    "moreover , these subspaces differ from @xmath83 by an analytic linear transformation , only .",
    "the first - order green s function is given by @xmath737 where @xmath738 are the projections along @xmath739 onto @xmath740 .",
    "singularities of the green s function therefore stem from either      the intersections occur in similar fashions as pointwise growth modes or boundary pointwise growth modes and can be tracked using evans functions .",
    "associated with such intersections are solutions with certain exponential asymptotic behavior @xmath743 , that yield spreading speeds via @xmath744 ; see @xcite .    of course , this discussion can now be combined with the case of periodic coefficients , thus giving a systematic basis to pointwise growth and invasion speeds in problems with _ asymptotically periodic coefficients_. we will come back to these issues when discussing nonlinear invasion problems in the next section .",
    "we think of the linear theory as a _ predictor _ for nonlinear phenomena . in the case of simple roots , there are typically open regions in parameter space where linear predictions are correct .",
    "we comment below on mechanisms that lead to deviations from linear predictions .      for simple pinched double roots , all concepts of pointwise stability studied here coincide , and there is a fairly universal description of associated phenomena @xcite .",
    "as far as the invasion speed is concerned , one observes a dichotomy between fronts that propagate with the linear spreading speed ( pulled fronts ) and fronts that propagate faster than the linear spreading speed ( pushed fronts ) .",
    "the prototypical example are fronts in the nagumo equation @xmath745 invading the unstable state @xmath746 and leaving behind the stable state @xmath747 . for @xmath748 ,",
    "these fronts propagate with the linear speed , for @xmath749 , the invasion speed is faster .",
    "more general ( explicit ) examples are known for the quintic - cubic ginzburg - landau equation @xcite .",
    "while speed predictions are fairly reliable , wavenumber predictions involve a wider variety of phenomena , even for pulled fronts .",
    "we assume that the spreading speed is realized by a simple pinched double root @xmath750 , which predicts marginal stability in a frame moving with the spreading speed .",
    "in other words , we expect to see linear oscillations with frequency @xmath751 in this frame of reference .",
    "the simplest prediction for patterns in the wake of the front would be to ask for the pattern to be in strong resonance with this frequency , in the comoving frame , so that there would exist a _ coherent invasion front _ @xmath752 , @xmath753 , and @xmath754 .",
    "this strong resonance is sometimes referred to as `` node conservation '' , referring to the actual process of creating patterns with nodes ( zeros ) which mark the minimal period of the pattern . however , subharmonic invasion fronts @xmath755 , @xmath756 , are also frequently observed , @xcite .",
    "the frequency @xmath757 of the coherent invasion front puts constraints on patterns in the wake of the front .",
    "assume that a wave train is created in the wake of the front , that is , @xmath758 for @xmath759 , where @xmath760 , and @xmath761 is the nonlinear dispersion relation in the wake .",
    "periodicity in the comoving frame then requires that @xmath762 which , considered as an equation for @xmath763 , determines the wavenumber in the wake .",
    "examples are systems such as the cahn - hilliard equation or the swift - hohenberg equation , with @xmath764 , which gives @xmath765 , as well as the complex ginzburg - landau equation @xmath766 where @xmath767 one can sometimes show the existence of such coherent invasion fronts @xcite , @xmath768 , and prove local stability .",
    "selection of slowest fronts however has not been shown in any such context , which makes mathematically rigorous statements on wavenumber selection impossible .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that stability of such a coherent invasion front implies `` node conservation '' in the invasion process , while instabilities lead to changed wavenumbers @xcite .",
    "note that when referring to stability of a coherent invasion front , we are asking about pointwise stability in the sense discussed in section [ s : inh ] with asymptotically periodic coefficients .    on the other hand , coherent invasion fronts with @xmath769 may simply not exist .",
    "a prototypical example are relaxation oscillators of the form @xmath770 with @xmath771 . for @xmath772 small , the equilibrium @xmath773 is unstable with selected speed and frequency @xmath774 , @xmath775 , since the problem is a small perturbation of the scalar @xmath113-problem .",
    "frequency @xmath657 would predict a stable stationary pattern in the wake of the front , which however does not exist for the given choice of @xmath407 , for @xmath772 sufficiently small .",
    "stable patterns in the problem are rather modulations of the relaxation oscillation @xmath776 , with @xmath777 .",
    "strongly resonant wavenumber selection ( or node conservation ) ( [ e : ks ] ) then implies @xmath778 , which implies @xmath779 .",
    "one numerically observes phase slips ( failure of node conservation ) in the leading edge , but this phenomenon does not appear to be well understood theoretically .    [ [ simple - growth - modes - secondary - fronts - and - wavenumber - corrections . ] ] simple growth modes  secondary fronts and wavenumber corrections . + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    when a strongly resonant primary front @xmath768 is unstable , we can attempt to predict secondary invasion speeds , frequencies , and wavenumbers based on the linearization at this primary front .",
    "such spreading speeds can now be determined by singularities of the evans function ( resonance poles ) or by right - sided pointwise growth modes .",
    "whenever these secondary spreading speeds are slower than the primary speeds , one can expect to see an increasingly long transient of the primary unstable pattern in the growing region between primary and secondary front .",
    "when the secondary speed exceeds the primary speed , the secondary front locks to the first front and we immediately see the pattern created by the secondary front , which amounts to an effective correction of the observed wavenumber .    in @xcite , secondary spreading speeds and selected wavenumbers were computed based on right - sided pointwise growth modes .",
    "it was found that right - sided pointwise growth modes underestimate the secondary invasion speeds , hinting at a resonance pole as the cause of destabilization of the primary front . in @xcite , the pattern selected by the primary front",
    "is in fact stable , yet we observe locked secondary fronts in certain parameter regimes .    beyond these predictions ,",
    "the phenomenon of staged invasion was investigated theoretically in @xcite , in the context of a simple coupled - mode problem . the predicted secondary spreading speed",
    "is based on right - sided pointwise growth modes or resonance poles .",
    "these predictions are validated by the construction of sub- and super - solutions and expansions for the width of the region occupied by the primary pattern in the locked regime are given .",
    "a similar perspective can also shed light on the formation of transverse patterns through invasion processes .",
    "our results in section [ s : spmult ] predict that the primary invasion mechanism creates a striped pattern .",
    "we can therefore first restrict to invasion fronts that are independent of @xmath589 , propagating in the @xmath588-direction , and find fronts as described above . when studying secondary invasion , however , we need to take into account the possibility of transverse patterning .",
    "we can , in principle , repeat the analysis outlined in the one - dimensional case for fixed transverse modulation , @xmath590 , and study instabilities via right - sided pointwise growth modes or resonance poles .",
    "the wavenumber @xmath596 with the fastest spreading speed is then the linear prediction for secondary patterns . since right - sided pointwise growth modes are evaluated using floquet theory , transverse patterns can , in principle , be modulated both in @xmath588 and @xmath589 , and a detailed analysis should distinguish between hexagons and squares , say , in the wake of fronts , as observed in @xcite , for instance .",
    "we note at this point that the description of secondary , transversely patterned fronts leads to systems with an invariant subspace given by the @xmath589-independent solutions . in the simplest context",
    ", this is apparent in an amplitude approximation to hexagon - roll competition in the swift - hohenberg equation @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect double double roots similar to the example of counter - propagating waves to occur in a robust fashion .",
    "we will discuss nonlinear phenomena associated with double double roots , next .      with robust examples in ecology @xcite and pattern formation @xcite ,",
    "double double roots are one of the main challenges that we isolated here . like any other algebraic pointwise growth mode ,",
    "these double double roots give linear predictions for the selected speed of the nonlinear system . in the context of a lotka - volterra competition model",
    ", a double double root was found that overestimates the invasion speed of the nonlinear system , see @xcite .",
    "examples in @xcite show that double double roots sometimes give correct predictions for spreading speeds . in the following ,",
    "we relate some of the results and observations in @xcite to our point of view",
    ". we will refer to double double roots as _ relevant _ if the linearly selected speed is the nonlinear speed and _ irrelevant _ if the nonlinear speed is slower .",
    "we will first lay out some general systems of equations that may give rise to double double roots .",
    "we will then relate these double double roots to the concepts of pgms , rpgms and bpgms developed earlier in this article .",
    "an important difference between relevant and irrelevant double double roots will be explained .",
    "we consider the skew - coupled system for @xmath780 , @xmath781 , @xmath782 with appropriate conditions on the nonlinear functions @xmath783 .",
    "note that the subspace @xmath784 is invariant , but that the skew - product structure of the nonlinear system is not enforced by the presence of this invariant subspace .",
    "we have already encountered one such system in the example of counter propagating waves .",
    "the linearization of ( [ e : skp ] ) at the origin possesses a lower block - triangular form , @xmath785 where @xmath786 are differential operators of order @xmath2 .",
    "due to the skew - product structure , the dispersion relation factors , @xmath787 double double roots now occur in a robust fashion whenever @xmath788 indeed , roots @xmath92 are analytic in @xmath84 as solutions to @xmath789 .",
    "if the double double root is pinched , then by definition @xmath139 is an algebraic pointwise growth mode .",
    "however , the stable and unstable eigenspaces will remain analytic in a neighborhood of @xmath139 and the double root does not yield a right- ( or left- ) sided pointwise growth mode .",
    "linearizing the eigenvalue problem in @xmath92 by writing the system @xmath790 as a first - order system in @xmath588 , @xmath791 the double double root corresponds to eigenvectors @xmath792 , @xmath793 .",
    "typically , @xmath794 , so that the eigenspace to @xmath313 in the full system is only one - dimensional and spanned by @xmath795 . once again , this is in complete analogy to the case of the counter - propagating wave problem",
    ". we can continue eigenvalues to @xmath796 to @xmath797 analytically and distinguish three cases :        one does however observe a significant difference between ( ii ) and ( iii ) in the context of a system of coupled fisher - kpp equations , see @xcite .",
    "there , it is observed numerically that if the double double root is of the form ( ii ) , then the double double root is relevant and the nonlinear speed is the linear speed . on the other hand ,",
    "if the double double root is of the form ( iii ) the double double root is irrelevant and the observed speed is slower .",
    "we will now motivate these observations .",
    "suppose we are considering invasion to the right , with positive spreading speed .",
    "suppose that this invasion occurs as a traveling front moving with a speed @xmath801 that is smaller than the linear invasion speed given by the double double root , and consider the linearization at the associated traveling wave , with associated evans function .    in case ( ii )",
    ", the stable subspace at @xmath802 flips at @xmath139 , so that its projection on the @xmath803-component is @xmath804-dimensional .",
    "since the full linearization leaves the @xmath803-subspace invariant , the unstable subspace at @xmath805 is @xmath806-dimensional , and , again as a consequence of the skew - product structure , stable and unstable subspaces at @xmath221 can not be transverse , which implies the existence of a resonance pole at @xmath314 and pointwise instability of the slower traveling front .      beyond the simple skew - product structure ( [ e : skp ] ) , we expect a number of interesting phenomena . in ( i)-(iii ) , we distinguish between uncoupled and unidirectionally linearly coupled systems .",
    "one can easily envision coupling in either direction via nonlinear terms , such as @xmath807 , @xmath808 , and try to derive nonlinear predictions for spreading speeds in the leading edge .",
    "such nonlinear coupling generated slow pushed fronts in the lotka - volterra equation ; see @xcite .",
    "nonlinear interactions may well couple `` modes '' that are not in strong resonance .",
    "again , some effects become apparent when studying linear systems with general boundary conditions . in @xcite",
    ", the absolute spectrum was defined through the dispersion relation as follows . for fixed @xmath214 , order the roots of @xmath428 by real part , so that @xmath809",
    ". the absolute spectrum is defined as @xmath810 clearly , pinched double roots belong to the absolute spectrum .",
    "for generic boundary conditions , the spectrum on finite but large domains converges to the absolute spectrum setwise , see @xcite .    comparing to our discussion",
    ", the absolute spectrum incorporates possible interactions between roots @xmath411 and @xmath811 , with equal temporal behavior and equal spatial decay rates , while double roots require strictly equal spatial behavior . allowing for time - periodic forcing at the boundary",
    ", one can also define absolute floquet spectra @xcite , when @xmath411 and @xmath812 .",
    "we expect that unstable absolute spectra will impact spreading speeds in a similar way as double double roots do .",
    "consider for instance the interaction of a hopf bifurcation and a pitchfork bifurcation , which would be described by amplitude equations for @xmath1 , the amplitude of the hopf mode , and @xmath113 , the amplitude of the pitchfork mode .",
    "since frequencies associated with the hopf mode are nonzero , we will not see double double roots in a coupled system . in an amplitude equation description , one does however average out oscillations with an ansatz @xmath813 , so that in the amplitude equation approximation we would see double double roots , with possible _ relevant _ nonlinear coupling between hopf and pitchfork .    coming back to the point of view taken in the beginning , section [ s:1.2 ] , absolute spectra give optimal decay in optimally chosen exponentially weighted spaces . similarly , relevant and irrelevant double",
    "double roots , cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) in the previous section , can also be distinguished via exponential weights : in the ( irrelevant ) case ( iii ) , it is possible to choose exponential weights separately for @xmath107 and @xmath814 so that the linearization is invertible ; see also @xcite .",
    "this is not possible in case ( ii ) since exponential weights require stronger decay in the @xmath814-component , which is incompatible with the direction of coupling .",
    "the results in this paper are mostly concerned with the linear theory in the leading edge of invasion processes .",
    "our systematic treatment revealed exotic , `` degenerate '' cases , which however occur in a robust fashion when studying concrete systems , in ecology or in pattern formation .",
    "it also revealed a linear rigidity in the formation of patterns , favoring stripes in all linear invasion processes .",
    "the discussion in this last section points towards a plethora of interesting nonlinear phenomena .",
