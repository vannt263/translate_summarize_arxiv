    "it has recently been demonstrated how an open - ended antiferromagnetic heisenberg spin chain can be used as an adiabatic quantum data bus @xcite ( see sec [ sub : db_review ] for a brief review ) .",
    "this data bus takes advantage of antiferromagnetic couplings to transfer qubits of information adiabatically .",
    "first a single qubit , encoded in a single spin is joined to an even length heisenberg spin chain slowly enough such that the adiabatic theorem applies .",
    "then a single spin on the other end of the chain is separated , again slowly enough for the adiabatic theorem to apply . as long as",
    "the interactions between the spins on the chain are predominately antiferromagnetic , the qubit will be successfully transferred from one end of the chain to the other .",
    "this protocol is illustrated in fig .",

    "a spin with the encoded qubit is connected to one end of an even length antiferromagnetic chain . afterwards",
    ", the spin on the opposite end is removed adiabatically .",
    "as long as the chain interactions are predominately antiferromagnetic and the adiabatic theorem is satisfied the qubit will be transferred . ]",
    "this paper demonstrates how by applying particular unitary operations to spin chains for single qubit gates , and by using a specific spin network for a cnot gate , one can achieve universal holonomic quantum computation .",
    "this method uses open - loop holonomies , meaning that the hamiltonian is not necessarily returned to the same state after the adiabatic process .",
    "the methods used here can also be extended to non - adiabatic implementations of geometrical quantum computing .",
    "holonomic quantum computation ( hqc ) was conceived and shown to be universal by zanardi and rasetti @xcite and was formulated in terms of a non - abelian berry phase .",
    "hqc is considered to be an appealing method for achieving fault tolerant quantum computing because of its geometrical nature and because it can be implemented adiabatically , and therefore has all of the advantages of adiabatic quantum computation @xcite .",
    "although many implementations of holonomic and geometric quantum computation are adiabatic , there are examples which are not @xcite .    other proposed architectures for holonomic quantum computation use a variety of architectures , including superconducting systems with josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "further examples propose using quantum dots @xcite .",
    "single molecule magnets have been another system of interest @xcite .",
    "a recent proposal has also been made for using holonomies which involve attaching and removing a spin from a spin 1 chain@xcite .",
    "this architecture , although it looks superficially very similar to ours , performs computations locally , at the site of the spin rather than by transport as ours does .",
    "@xcite also proposes an implementation on ultracold polar molecules .",
    "another interesting proposal involves using a quantum wire with a twisted cluster state hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "this proposal is similar to ours , but implements the twist in a fundamentally different way .",
    "most other approaches to hqc involve building a system , and explicitly calculating the holonomies caused by various manipulations of the system . in our proposal",
    "we start with a process which has a trivial berry phase .",
    "real space twists are then performed on the spin chain used in this process .",
    "unlike most examples of hqc , all results can be derived without explicitly considering the curvature of the underlying manifold of states , all single qubit gates result from the same underlying hamiltonian with basis rotations applied to it .    in principle",
    "this idea could be used for more traditional , closed - loop holonomic quantum computation by twisting a spin chain used to transport the qubit adiabatically slowly , performing an adiabatic transport protocol , untwisting the chain adiabatically slowly , and performing the transport protocol in reverse to return to the initial hamiltonian .",
    "the net result of this process would be to perform a rotation on the initial spin which the qubit is encoded and return the spin chain to its initial state . in this case spin rotation would be achieved by a non - abelian berry phase acquired via transport on a closed adiabatic loop in parameter space , and would therefore be a closed - loop holonomic gate .",
    "such a process involves unnecessarily many steps however , so it is more convenient to think of this process in terms of the framework of open - loop holonomic quantum computation .",
    "the mathematical differences of this approach from others affords us the advantage that the spectrum of the underlying hamiltonian is the same for all twists , meaning that , by construction , all single qubit gates can be implemented in a way which requires the same annealing time to reach a given accuracy .",
    "this architecture has the advantage that the only operation it ever requires to be adiabatically performed is the joining or removal of a spin from a chain or cluster .",
    "the nature of the twists used here also means that a non - adiabatic transport protocol could be used instead , and universal computation would still be achieved .",
    "this paper also outlines an implementation of the necessary components of this design using superconducting flux qubits .",
    "superconducting flux qubits are a popular architecture for implementing scalable adiabatic quantum computing @xcite , and therefore are a natural choice for designing a scalable holonomic quantum computer .",
    "an additional advantage of the use of superconducting flux qubits is that the designs tend to have spatially extended qubits and a high degree of connectivity@xcite .",
    "the large spatial extent of the qubits means that a design could be implemented in which a qubit would only need to be transferred across a small number of spins to be moved from one location in a computer to any other arbitrary location . for this reason it is only necessary that the transport protocol be efficient for short chains , as has already been demonstrated in @xcite , rather than in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "there has been recent experimental work involving quantum annealing to degenerate ground state manifolds using currently available superconducting flux qubit hardware@xcite . in this paper",
    "it was demonstrated experimentally that signatures of quantum behaviors can be observed in the final state within a degenerate ground state manifold .",
    "this provides an indication that a ground state manifold can be produced accurately enough on current hardware that quantum effects dominate over classical effects and design inaccuracies .",
    "although the architecture proposed here can not be implemented on the hardware used in @xcite , this experiment does provide proof of principle for the use of degenerate manifolds in superconducting flux qubit systems .    while it is not the main focus of this paper , we would also like to point out that there are other potential methods of implementing this architecture .",
    "one example of such an implementation would be to use a coupled cavities scheme similar to the one explored in @xcite .",
    "for such an implementation long spin chains may be required , and as a result properties in the thermodynamic limit may be important .",
    "for such an implementation , the architecture given in this paper could easily be generalized to a j1-j2 spin chain with @xmath0 which is know to be gaped in the thermodynamic limit@xcite . in this case",
    ", another option would be to implement the architecture non - adiabatically using the methods described in @xcite .",
    "consider initially an antiferromagnetic heisenberg spin chain .",
    "it has been shown that such a chain can act as a quantum data bus , both adiabatically@xcite and by using the dynamics of its excitations @xcite .",
    "the initial hamiltonian is given by    @xmath1",
    "now imagine that one inserts a twist into the spin chain by applying a local unitary transformation of the form @xmath2 on @xmath3 spins , where @xmath4 are all mutually orthogonal to each other .",
    "this yields a new hamiltonian of the form    @xmath5    such a twist does not effect the spectrum of the hamiltonian , and therefore the dynamics of the adiabatic quantum bus protocol , or other quantum bus protocols which may make use of the unitary dynamics of the hamiltonian .",
    "it is important to note , however , that after transfer across the chain , the spin will be rotated into the @xmath4 basis . as we will demonstrate later , transfer through this twisted spin chain",

    "one should note that while in this example we consider a simple heisenberg spin chain , gates can be implemented in this way on an xyz spin chain or a j1-j2 spin chain , or other sufficiently complex quantum spin hamiltonians . figuring out which twist to use to perform a given gate can be done easily and will be illustrated in the next section .",

    "to test this we need to answer 2 questions .",

    "note that because the case where a not gate is performed , and the case where the gate acts trivially are related by a simple unitary transformation on the hamiltonian , acceptable performance in one of these cases implies acceptable performance in the other .",
