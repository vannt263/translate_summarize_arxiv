    "the study of quantum field theory ( qft ) in @xmath0-dimensions provides valuable insights into many difficult conceptual problems of qft s , as well as giving us situations where appropriate use of infinite dimensional symmetries , like conformal invariance and @xmath1 symmetry , considerably simplifies the field theoretic computation .",
    "one might ask if similar insights could also be obtained by studying qft s in @xmath0-dimensional noncommutative spacetime .",
    "indeed there is reason for some optimism regarding this query , as it is possible to define notions of conformal invariance , kac - moody and virasoro symmetries @xcite .    in this article",
    "we will address the question of quantum integrability , and investigate the noncommutative analog of the quantum sinh - gordon model .",
    "we will argue that it is integrable , in the sense that there is no particle production , and calculate the exact two - particle scattering matrix .    in section 2",
    ", we will summarize the results on twisted qft s based on our earlier work @xcite , and then review scattering theory for noncommutative qft s @xcite . in section 3 , we will recall some essential features of the quantum sinh - gordon model on commutative spacetime , and then go on to construct the two - particle @xmath2-matrix @xmath3 for its noncommutative counterpart . a discussion of the properties of @xmath3 will be provided in section 4 .",
    "two dimensional noncommutative spacetime is generated by operators @xmath4 satisfying the commutation relations @xmath5 = i \\theta_{\\mu\\nu }",

    "thus poincar transformations , with their usual action on coordinates , belong to the automorphism group of noncommutative @xmath18 .    our interest in this noncommutative space is to understand the notion of integrability for quantum theories . as long as the hamiltonian is ( formally ) hermitian , the quantum theory on such a space is manifestly unitary , as emphasized in the case of field theories by @xcite , and demonstrated for single particle quantum mechanics by @xcite .",
    "we will therefore proceed to write free quantum fields , which we will use to build interactions .",
    "a free quantum scalar field @xmath19 can be expanded as @xmath20 while it is possible to quantize the field by imposing the standard ( or canonical ) commutation relations between @xmath21 s and @xmath22 s , more general commutation relations are possible as well @xcite .",
    "these _ twisted _ commutation relations are of the form : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is any lorentz - invariant function of two - momenta @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    in @xcite",
    ", we argued that in spacetime dimension greater than 2 , compatibility with quantum statistics of identical particles requires @xmath24 to be of the form @xmath27 we will work henceforth with this choice of @xmath24 , and argue in section 3 why this leads to integrability of the @xmath2-matrix for the noncommutative sinh - gordon model .",
    "even though the commutation relations ( [ twist1][twist3 ] ) are twisted , the operators @xmath28 act on the usual ( bosonic ) fock space . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath29 be the ordinary or untwisted creation and annihilation operators : @xmath30 = 0 , \\quad [ c_p , c^\\dagger_q ] = 2p_0 \\delta(\\vec{p } - \\vec{q } ) .",
    "\\label{usualcomm}\\ ] ] there is a simple relation between the @xmath31 s and the @xmath32 s ( for @xmath33 ) . to this end , consider the fock space momentum operator @xmath34 associated with @xmath19 : @xmath35 & = & -i\\partial_\\mu \\phi(x)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using @xmath34 , we can realize the twisted creation - annihilation operators in terms of the untwisted ones : @xmath36 it is easy to check that ( [ atoc1 ] , [ atoc2 ] ) reproduce the twisted commutation relations ( [ twist1][twist3 ] ) .",
    "thus the @xmath32 s act on the same fock space as that of the untwisted creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the map ( [ atoc1],[atoc2 ] ) is a `` dressing transformation '' ( first discussed in @xcite ) , and the commutation relations for the @xmath32 s and @xmath37 s that follow from it are simple examples of the algebra discussed in@xcite",
    ".    a twisted @xmath38-particle state is @xmath39 this is related very simply to the ordinary @xmath38-particle state . using ( [ atoc2 ] ) , @xmath40 in @xmath0 dimensions , it is often convenient to work in light - cone coordinates , with the two - momentum characterized by _",
    "@xmath41 : @xmath42 . the twisted commutation relation ( [ twist3 ] )",
    "then becomes @xmath43    finally , the quantum field @xmath19 even though free , is not local : the commutator @xmath44 $ ] is non - zero for @xmath45 and @xmath46 space - like separated @xcite .",
    "consider a theory with interaction hamiltonian @xmath47 the scattering operator for this theory is @xmath48 the first non - trivial term in the perturbative expansion of the above is @xmath49 using the mode expansion for @xmath19 , let us look at a typical term in the above , which is of the form @xmath50 . using ( [ atoc2 ] ) and ( [ planewavestar ] ) , @xmath51 where we have integrated by parts and discarded surface terms to obtain the last expression .",
    "but ( [ cs ] ) is just the same as the corresponding term from the commutative scattering theory .",
    "hence to order @xmath52 , the noncommutative scattering operator is the same as in the commutative theory .    more generally , this is true to any order in perturbation theory ( see @xcite for details of the proof ) . in particular",
    ", this means that @xmath53 the scattering operator on noncommutative space is the same as that for the commutative counterpart . in particular ,",
    "if a commutative theory is renormalizable , so is its noncommutative counterpart , because the number of counterterms is the same .",
    "as far as scattering is concerned , the main difference between a commutative theory and its noncommutative counterpart is in the nature of asymptotic states .",
    "but since we know the explicit map ( [ statemap ] ) between these two kinds of asymptotic states , the matrix elements of @xmath3 can be calculated in terms of those of @xmath54 .",
    "the result ( [ soperator ] ) is true for theories without interacting non - abelian gauge fields only @xcite .",
    "for example , in noncommutative @xmath55 there are effects that violate lorentz invariance .",
    "however , this caveat is not applicable here , as we will only consider theories where the interaction hamiltonian is made up of matter fields only .",
    "one of the the simplest non - trivial integrable model in @xmath0-dimensional commutative spacetime is the sinh - gordon model .",
    "this is the theory with interaction hamiltonian of the form @xmath56 where the double dots above stand for normal - ordering .",
    "for this theory , there is no particle production : the amplitude @xmath57 for producing @xmath38 outgoing particles by colliding @xmath58 incoming particles in zero if @xmath59 .",
    "in addition , the `` elastic '' amplitude @xmath60 factorizes into products of two - particle scattering amplitudes @xmath61 .",
    "the exact expression of the two - particle @xmath2-matrix on commutative spacetime has been given in @xcite : @xmath62}{\\tanh \\left[\\frac{1}{2 } \\left(\\eta + i      \\frac{\\pi}{2}b(g)\\right ) \\right ] } , \\quad { \\rm where } \\quad b(g ) =      \\frac{2g^2}{8\\pi + g^2}\\ ] ] and @xmath41 the relative rapidity .    a very nice argument motivating quantum integrability for the commutative case has been given by dorey in @xcite .",
    "we will use this argument , adapting it appropriately to the noncommutative case .    consider the theory based on the free field @xmath19 as in ( [ tfield ] ) , with the free hamiltonian @xmath63 , and an interaction @xmath64 , where by @xmath65 we mean @xmath66 .",
    "there are two diagrams ( figure [ fig:2to4 - 1 ] ) that contribute to the @xmath67 scattering amplitude at tree level .",
    "the amplitude for this process is @xmath68 where we have used ( [ statemap ] , [ soperator ] ) , and the fact that @xmath69 .",
    "let us add an extra interaction of the form @xmath70 .",
    "we see that the @xmath67 process receives an additional contribution from a third diagram ( figure [ fig:2to4 - 2 ] ) , which of the form @xmath71 by choosing @xmath72 , we can make the total tree - level amplitude @xmath73 for the @xmath67 process to vanish .    for the new interaction hamiltonian @xmath74 , the amplitude for the @xmath75 process is now a non - zero constant , which can be made to vanish by judiciously choosing an extra interaction piece of the form @xmath76 .",
    "continuing in this manner , one finds that the theory with the interaction hamiltonian of the form @xmath77 has no particle production at tree - level : all processes of the form @xmath78 @xmath79 are forbidden ( we have moved the mass term @xmath80 from the free hamiltonian to the interaction hamiltonian , so that it can be presented in the convenient form ( [ ncsg ] ) . )    a crucial ingredient in the argument above is the specific choice ( [ gform ] ) of the twist function @xmath24 for the commutation relations of the free field creation and annihilation operators .",
    "had we chosen it to be of some other form , it is easy to see that we would lose the _ no particle production _ condition , and hence quantum integrability . in particular , choosing the twist function to be identity ( i.e. using conventional commutation relations ( [ usualcomm ] ) for the free field creation / annihilation operators ) leads to particle production at tree - level itself , as shown explicitly by @xcite ( however , see also @xcite for a discussion of the absence of tree - level particle production in the noncommutative _ sine_-gordon model ) .",
    "our argument also extends to higher loops . for a scalar field theory ( with , say , polynomial interactions ) in commutative @xmath0 dimensions , the only source of ultraviolet divergence in perturbation theory is from single closed loops ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "these can be absorbed by renormalizing the mass of the particle , or equivalently by working with the normal - ordering the interaction hamiltonian to start with , as we have done .    as we argued earlier , although the scattering operator for the noncommutative theory and its commutative counterpart is the same , the asymptotic states are different . using the map ( [ statemap ] ) , we find the two - particle amplitude for the noncommutative case to be @xmath81}{\\tanh \\left[\\frac{1}{2 }      \\left(\\eta + i \\frac{\\pi}{2}b(g)\\right ) \\right ] } e^{-i\\theta m^2      \\sinh \\eta}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the ( physical ) mass of the sinh - gordon particle .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath83 satisfies the following conditions :              the fact the noncommutative scattering matrix for the sinh - gordon model differs from commutative one only by a phase may seem surprising at first .",
    "it was pointed out by mitra @xcite that overall phases of the form @xmath90 are allowed , over and above the form of the @xmath2-matrix dictated by dynamics . for local fields ,",
    "the @xmath91 are required to vanish . however , since our field is non - local , we have no such restriction .",
    "we find , in fact , that @xmath92 ."
