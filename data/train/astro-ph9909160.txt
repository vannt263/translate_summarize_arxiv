    "non - parametric mass reconstruction from gravitational shear is now a very well understood problem , and was widely refined over the last few years .",
    "it is no longer a technical issue to reconstruct clusters ( see squires & kaiser 1996 for a detailed review ) as well as large scale structures ( van waerbeke et al .",
    "although the computational speed of mass reconstruction might be too low for large scale surveys ( lombardi & bertin 1999 ) , this is not a major concern yet according to the actual size of the lensing surveys .",
    "naturally a next step in gravitational lensing is the search for a better use of the information present in the mass maps .",
    "assuming that all the problems concerning the residual of point spread function corrections are or will be solved , there is useful information hidden in the noise of mass maps that can be extracted .",
    "an important application of lensing is the possibility to built mass - selected samples ( reblinsky & bartelmann , 1999 ) as a probe of cosmology ( oukbir & blanchard 1997 , reblinsky et al .",
    "in particular a joint analysis of clusters of galaxies from weak lensing , sunyaev - zeldovich , x - rays and galaxy catalogues would be valuable .",
    "a related issue is the possible existence of _ dark lenses _ ( hattori 1997 ) , and already , the detection of a mass clump not obviously associated with light ( erben et al .",
    "1999 ) raised the question of quantifying accurately the significance of halo detections .",
    "the understanding of the noise properties in mass maps is therefore necessary for anyone who wants to measure the mass distribution from gravitational lensing in order to constrain cosmological models .",
    "this point was understood by schneider ( 1996 ) who constructed the so - called s - statistic , aimed to quantify the significance of mass peaks .",
    "using bootstrapping of the data , he derives the frequency of observed mass peaks .",
    "the s - statistic is similar to the the signal - to - noise derived in kaiser & squires ( 1993 ) ( and confirmed later in numerical simulations by wilson et al .",
    "1996 ) but it has the interesting feature that works directly with the ellipticity of the galaxies ( no mass reconstruction is required ) , and the smoothing filter can be optimized in order to increase the signal - to - noise .",
    "so far , the noise analysis and the statistical significance of mass reconstructions have not been studied as much as the mass reconstruction methods themselves .",
    "we have only some global clues of the behavior of the noise , which above all , seem to depend on the mass reconstruction method ( squires & kaiser 1996 ) .",
    "seitz & schneider ( 1996 ) identified several characteristics of the noise in their numerical simulations : due to the smoothing , the power spectrum is not flat and driven by the intrinsic ellipticity of the galaxies , their number density and the smoothing window scale .",
    "lombardi & bertin ( 1998a , 1998b ) gave the first analytical estimate of the variance of the total mass of a reconstructed cluster , taking into account the noise correlation induced by the smoothing window .",
    "they have found differences with the numerical results of seitz & schneider ( 1996 ) that they attributed to _ technical _ differences .",
    "they worked with shear line - integral reconstruction methods , and found that the noise is minimized when curl - free kernels are used .",
    "as discussed in seitz & schneider ( 1996 ) the curl - free kernels have a noise amplitude similar to the kaiser & squires ( 1993 ) ( hereafter ks ) reconstruction , but the line - integral reconstruction is a non - local process , which complicates the noise analysis ( lombardi & bertin ( 1998a , 1998b ) ) . on the other hand , the maximum likelihood ( hereafter ml ) algorithm ( bartelmann et al . 1996 ) performs a local reconstruction , but its noise properties can hardly be studied analytically .",
    "in fact , the ks scheme seems to be the easiest approach to an analytical description of the noise .",
    "it has been demonstrated in the case of lensing by large scale structures ( see the simulations performed in van waerbeke et al .",
    "1999 ) that the noise in ml reconstructions is accurately described by the weak lensing approximation ( and therefore by the ks equations ) .",
    "continuing this work , this paper is a study of the noise properties of ml methods in the case of non - critical clusters of galaxies with correlated noise , when the smoothing is taken into account .",
    "this paper shows that the noise in ml reconstruction agrees very well with the analytical prediction made from the weak lensing approximation .",
    "it demonstrates that the mass variance derived in lombardi & bertin ( 1998b ) is valid , and , to a larger extent , that the noise is uncorrelated with the signal even for non - critical clusters of galaxies .",
    "this is also consistent with the empirical analysis done in seitz & schneider ( 1996 ) .",
    "assuming that the smoothed intrinsic ellipticities are described by the statistics of a two - dimensional gaussian random field , the bbks technique ( bardeen et al .",
    "1986 ) is used in order to quantify the significance of the over - densities in ml mass reconstructions .",
    "this analysis provides a quantitative way to identify the structures in mass maps and to extract information from the noise : this result is verified on numerical simulations , which shows that to a very good approximation a mass map is the sum of a completely known gaussian field plus the lensing signal .",
    "section 2 gives some general considerations about lensing theory used in this work .",
    "the noise model is developed in section 3 , where each noise contribution is identified .",
    "an estimator for the variance of the mass in a given area is calculated . in section 4 , the noise model and numerical simulations of cluster lensing are compared . in section 5",
    "the significance level of a reconstructed mass halo based on a 2d gaussian field statistic is derived , which is then checked against numerical simulations .",
    "we consider a lens of surface mass density @xmath0 located at a redshift @xmath1 along the line of sight @xmath2 , and a single source plane is put at a redshift @xmath3 . at first approximation , the universe is equivalent to a single lens , so there is no loss of generality here to consider a single lens .",
    "the projected gravitational potential @xmath4 and the surface mass density of the lens are given by the 2-dimensional poisson equation    @xmath5    the critical density ( for which the lens produces multiple images ) is given by    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the angular diameter distance between the redshifts @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "for convenience , the lensing potential is defined as @xmath10 .",
    "the ratio    @xmath11    is the convergence of the lens , which describes the isotropic deformation of a light beam coming from the sources .",
    "the light beam is also sheared , which modifies the shape of the source galaxies .",
    "the shape of a galaxy is described by the second moments of its centered surface brightness profile    @xmath12    the source and image shape matrices are related by the equation    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the magnification matrix which depends on the convergence @xmath15 and the shear @xmath16 of the lens ,    @xmath17    @xmath15 and @xmath16 are fully determined by the second derivatives of the lensing potential via    @xmath18    the ellipticity is defined in the complex plane as    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the axis ratio of a galaxy and @xmath21 the orientation . eq.([mapping ] ) written in terms of source and image ellipticities is    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the complex reduced shear . the observable is @xmath24 , but this paper is restricted to non - critical lenses , for which @xmath25 , so that @xmath26 is an observable as well . in that case",
    "@xmath26 can be immediately read off from the galaxy ellipticities ; as shown by schramm & kayser ( 1995 ) and schneider & seitz ( 1995 ) the mean observed ellipticities of the galaxies is an unbiased estimate of the reduced shear :    @xmath27    the mass reconstructed from shear measurement alone is not fully constrained because any transformation of the lensing potential of the form    @xmath28    leaves the reduced shear @xmath26 unchanged .",
    "this is the so - called mass - sheet degeneracy : the mass is determined up to an additive constant and an appropriate scaling ( eq.([transfo ] ) implies @xmath29 ) .",
    "as already mentioned , the weak lensing approximation linearises the lensing equation and dramatically simplifies the noise analysis .",
    "the weak lensing limit of eq.([elli_single ] ) is    @xmath30    thus @xmath31 becomes an unbiased estimate of the shear . in the fourier space eq.([lens_def ] ) takes the form ( kaiser 1998 ) :    @xmath32    where there is an implicit summation over @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "an unbiased ( but extremely noisy ) estimate of the convergence @xmath15 is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the noise part , which depends on the intrinsic ellipticities of the galaxies and their spatial distribution .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath38 is    @xmath39    in order to avoid the infinite variance problem ( caused by the discreteness distribution of the galaxies ) , and to have a mass map with a reasonable amplitude of noise , the convergence is reconstructed from the smoothed galaxy ellipticities , so smoothed fields are used in the following .",
    "uppercase letters refer to smoothed fields while lowercase letters refer to unsmoothed fields ( e.g. @xmath40 for the smoothed @xmath15 , @xmath41 for @xmath16 and @xmath42 for @xmath43 ) .",
    "the smoothing function is denoted by @xmath44 , the total number of galaxies in the field by @xmath45 , and the total field area by @xmath46 .",
    "galaxies are at positions @xmath47 .",
    "the reconstructed mass map is now the smoothed convergence with an unbiased estimate given by    @xmath48    the number density of galaxies is @xmath49 .",
    "it is worth noting that eq.([lens_eq ] ) implies that the reconstructed convergence of a smoothed shear field is identical to the initial smoothed convergence . in other words ,",
    "smoothing and reconstruction are commutative processes in the frame of the weak lensing approximation .",
    "the reconstructed convergence @xmath50 is the sum of the true convergence @xmath51 and a correlated noise @xmath52 .",
    "if @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the smoothed @xmath55 and @xmath56 then    @xmath57    if the smoothing length is small enough ( arcmin scale ) the signal is approximately constant within the aperture .",
    "this is certainly not true for cluster mass profiles , but it should still give a reasonable description of the noise .",
    "it implies that the sum over the galaxy ellipticities within the aperture is equal to the smoothed shear plus the intrinsic ellipticity contribution ( which is eq.([weaklenslimit ] ) for the smoothed fields ) :    @xmath58    inserting this into eq.([kappanoise ] ) gives the analytic expression of the noise term :    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the fourier transform of the window function .",

    "this clustering term is generally ignored , and accounts for possible increase of the variance of @xmath52 in the case of non - uniform sampling of the source galaxies within the aperture .",
    "its contribution can be potentially important if the source galaxies belongs to a thin redshift slice ( as the angular clustering approaches the spatial clustering ) .",

    "the widths of the smoothing windows are @xmath110 pixels , therefore there is a mean number of @xmath111 galaxies per aperture .",
    "an edge of width @xmath112 pixels is systematically removed from the analysis because of its intrinsic higher noise due to the change of the finite difference scheme at the boundaries of the grid and the smaller number of galaxies in the aperture .",
    "the calibration constant @xmath113 ( see section 4.2 ) is calculated by forcing the total mass of each reconstructed map to be equal to the total mass of the smoothed mass distribution of the lens .",
    "therefore the variance of the _ total _ reconstructed mass map is zero , so the analysis is restricted to half of the grid size .      for each reconstruction ,",
    "the mass map is rescaled in such a way that the total mass measured on each realization is the same as the total mass in the smoothed lens model .",
    "such a rescaling changes the amplitude of the noise correlation function : if @xmath114 is the real mass distribution , the reconstructed mass map @xmath115 is related to the real mass map by @xmath116 , where @xmath113 is the mass - sheet degeneracy constant and @xmath117 the noise term .",

    "the agreement between the model and the measurement in the simulation is good , however , there is a tendency of the measured variance to be slightly underestimated for @xmath130 .",
    "this is a consequence of the normalisation of the mass maps ( the total measured mass is explicitely set to to the total mass in the model , so the measured variance is zero at the scale @xmath131 ) .",
    "the errors are independent of the position of @xmath46 on the grid , which confirms that signal and noise are uncorrelated to a very good approximation .",

    "according to section 3.2 , the noise in the reconstructed mass maps is equivalent to the convolution of a point process by a smoothing aperture , therefore it is expected to approach a gaussian field distribution when the aperture is larger than the mean angular distance between galaxies .",

    "figure [ profile_new.ps ] is an example of mean profile and its dispersion derived from eqs.([profiles ] ) .",
    "it is possible to understand the noise properties of reconstructed mass maps with rather simple arguments .",
    "the noise in ml mass reconstruction is very close to a 2d gaussian random field , which has several implications for the analysis of mass maps : for cluster lensing , the `` blurred '' area around cluster of galaxies where the identification of mass clumps and substructures is uncertain can in fact be described accurately .",
    "it is possible to give the probability that the fluctuations are real mass - over - densities , and to give their mass with an error bar . for large scale surveys , small mass concentrations ( not visible individually ) can be detected statistically as a deviation from the expected noise gaussian statistic .",
    "groups and small clusters should show up in the statistical distribution of peaks .",
    "preliminary results using ray - tracing simulations ( jain , seljak , white 1999 , jain private communication ) already confirmed this , but the detailled analysis of peak statistic in realistic cosmological models is left for another work .    the noise autocorrelation function and the mass error bars were derived and compared to numerical simulations of non - critical cluster lenses .",
    "the agreement between the predictions and the simulations proves that the noise , caused by the intrinsic ellipticities and the discrete distribution of the galaxies , is nearly uncorrelated with the lensing signal despite the non - linear lensing equation .",
    "consequently , the weak lensing approximation applies , which simplifies considerably the noise analysis .",
    "it is worth to remind that this is true for non - critical clusters only .",
    "however it is reasonable to think that the smearing of the signal due to the smoothing implies that the approximation still works for noise analysis in critical clusters ( if the smoothed mass distribution becomes non - critical ) .",
    "a bbks - type approach was used to predict the statistics of noise peaks in mass maps . again",
    "the numerical simulations are accurately fitted by these predictions .",
    "the fact that the noise approaches a gaussian distribution is due to the large mean number of galaxies in each aperture ( about @xmath170 ) .",
    "there is certainly a limitation of the method used here : if the smoothing window is too small or too `` fuzzy '' it should deviate from a gaussian statistic .",
    "this departure from gaussianity was observed in the s - statistic of schneider ( 1996 ) because he used a compensated filter .",
    "a work worth to be done is to investigate the limits of the method , and eventually to consider the poisson behavior of counts in small cells , as in szapudi & colombi ( 1996 ) .",
    "however , in the context discussed here , it is reliable to use gaussian statistics .",
    "i discussed so far only the ml mass reconstruction method , and compared it to the analytical ks .",
    "can this analysis be used for other mass reconstruction methods ? there are some numerical indications that the curl - free line - integral approaches are close to the ks reconstruction , ( seitz & schneider 1996 , lombardi & bertin , 1998b ) and therefore close to the ml as well . for the newly developed regularization methods ( seitz et al .",
    "1998 , bridle et al . 1998 )",
    "it probably not the case .",
    "the noise is reduced in these methods , in an optimal way that real structures should still emerge from the noise .",
    "the main advantage of the regularization methods is their adaptative spatial resolution depending on the local signal - to - noise .",
    "however the regularization parameter is arbitrary and can potentially kill the small scale fluctuations that we are looking for , so the analysis done here should not apply .",
    "it is therefore valuable to make a study of the noise properties for all the reconstruction methods in order to search for a better use of the noisy regions of the mass maps and to compare their ability to detect the mass overdensities .",
