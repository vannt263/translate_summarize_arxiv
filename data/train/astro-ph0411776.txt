    "starbursting ( sb ) regions are likely to host rapidly expanding , highly ionized gaseous bubbles ( `` superwinds '' ) .",
    "these bubbles are metal - enriched and powered by the correlated supernovae explosions of the stars on the high end of the sb region s mass - function .",
    "if the starburst is related to a merger event , shock - heating during the interaction may also lead to a wind of ionized gas @xcite . when nested in low enough mass galaxies ,",
    "these bubbles have a good chance of overpowering their host s potential well and escaping to pollute the intergalactic medium ( igm ) @xcite , though @xcite note that even at high mass merging galaxies may have sufficient energy to produce expanding , gaseous bubbles . at high redshift ,",
    "such bubbles are expected to travel at velocities of 100 to 1000 @xmath13 and eventually expand to radii of @xmath14 .",
    "presumably the winds entrain the metals of prior and recent supernovae activity ; therefore , the bubbles may cause metal - line absorption in background sources in the @xmath15    range . indeed , at low redshift the dwarf starbursting galaxy ngc  1569 is observed to possess these characteristics @xcite , as is ngc 1705 , another dwarf starburster @xcite .",
    "this enrichment process is believed to have played a leading role in the production of the observed metallicity of the present - day igm @xcite , and therefore further observational understanding of this pollution mechanism is key to the refinement of enrichment scenarios .",
    "furthermore , an exploration of the starbursting regions in absorption will constrain dynamic models of starburst winds and serve as an observational bridge for understanding the starbursting process at high redshift .",
    "a link has recently been proposed between these metal - enriched expanding bubbles and the very strong mg ii absorption systems ( @xmath16   ) observed in quasar spectra ( @xcite , hereafter bccv ) . in this paper",
    "the cutoff @xmath7 has been relaxed to @xmath17   , as there is no known specific cutoff to the absorption depth of these systems and , as demonstrated later , smaller systems display features consistent with this phenomena .",
    "it is , however , demonstrated that stronger systems are more likely to be associated with this absorption host scenario .",
    "assuming a simple spherical shape for the expanding shell , the expected profile for such a system is two roughly symmetric absorption lobes , corresponding to the cooler , expanding regions of the bubble , one in front and one behind the host galaxy along the line of sight , centered around a kinematically small , hot , non - absorbing region ( a spectral `` inversion '' ) , where the actual host is located . as the expanding gas is subject to raleigh - taylor instability , it is expected to clump , causing distinct kinematic components to appear in the absorption spectra .",
    "cloud - to - cloud metallicity variation may also be expected , a result of unique supernova history and/or incomplete mixing .",
    "the expected velocity range of such systems is @xmath18 .",
    "bccv identified all of these features in the profiles of a small set of strong mgii absorption systems .",
    "similarly , @xcite find that gas `` infall '' from such winds could help explain the kinematics they observed in the spectra of a strong mg ii system .",
    "these authors also emphasized that the study of more highly ionized species ( e.g.  civ ) may further reveal the origin of the mgii gas and its relation to sn superwinds ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "based on the assumption that strong mg ii absorbers trace superwinds , and therefore starbursting galaxies , bccv make a crude prediction of the redshift path density ( @xmath19 ) of mg ii absorption .",
    "these authors found it to be consistent with a value extrapolated from the mg ii survey presented in @xcite , hereafter ss92 , though the comparison suffers from small number statistics .",
    "several goals of the work presented here include an extension of the work of bccv to higher redshift , to obtain a large statistical sample , and to investigate evolution with redshift .",
    "an interesting correlation could also be made between strong mgii absorption systems and lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) , which are thought to frequently harbor starbursting regions .",
    "comparisons of the velocities of the interstellar absorption features with nebular emission lines suggests wind speeds of @xmath20 km  s@xmath11 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in the gas , one identifies metal - line transitions of both low and high - ion species with significant column densities .",
    "therefore , one may probe the physical characteristics of these winds ( e.g.  speed , cross - section , ionization state , etc . ) through absorption - line studies . in turn",
    ", these observations should constrain the incidence and evolution of superwinds during the first @xmath21  gyr of the universe .    a competing scenario for the origin of strong mgii absorption",
    "comes from @xcite , hereafter mm96 .",
    "these authors describe a model where the absorption is associated with gaseous galactic halos in a two - phase structure : a shock heated hot phase and a photoionized phase of clouds moving through the halo .",
    "the authors associate this phenomenon with lyman limit systems , though note that at high redshift ( @xmath22 ) the model predicts too few lyman limits .",
    "an important aspect of this scenario is that strong mgii absorption is primarily restricted to the halos of relatively massive galaxies .",
    "this is because the shock heated gas can cool only where the gas is dense enough to radiate efficiently , limiting the possible extent of the cold gas .",
    "presumably the authors were motivated by observations showing that strong mgii systems at @xmath23 are frequently identified at impact parameters less than @xmath24  kpc from @xmath25 galaxies @xcite . in any case , the mm96 scenario ties mgii absorption to massive , passively evolving galaxies rather than merging or starburst events .",
    "this paper presents two lines of investigation into the nature of strong ( equivalent width refers to the equivalent width of the mgii @xmath26 transition . ]",
    "@xmath27   ) mgii systems : ( 1 ) an automated search of the quasar spectra database of the sloan digital sky survey data release 3 ( sdss - dr3 ) for mgii systems with @xmath28 ; and ( 2 ) the analysis of a sample of mgii systems ( @xmath29 ) identified in high resolution spectra of 92 quasars .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "@xmath30 2 explains the data used in this study and the analysis undertook on it .",
    "@xmath30 3 presents our results , including a plot of @xmath19 versus redshift , a tabulation of each of the discovered systems , and a plot of interesting metal absorption lines .",
    "this section also includes a discussion of the relevance of our results to models of metal pollution of the igm .",
    "the paper concludes in @xmath30  4 with a few remarks about future avenues of research .",
    "this section describes two surveys for strong mgii lines . in the first , the moderate resolution spectra of data release  3 from the sloan digital sky survey are searched for absorption .",
    "this survey provides the largest sample of mgii systems compiled to date .",
    "the second data set is a much smaller sample of high resolution spectroscopy originally obtained to study high @xmath31 damped ly@xmath32  systems .",
    "this data extends the search to higher redshift and , more importantly , allows a quantitative assessment of the kinematics of mgii absorbers .",
    "the first set of data comes from data release  3 of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - dr3 ) .",
    "the sample has been restricted to sdss - dr3 quasars with redshift @xmath33 , for a total of 45023 quasars .",
    "sdss spectroscopy has a resolution @xmath34 and covers @xmath35   .",
    "this coverage implies a redshift search window of @xmath3 for the mgii  @xmath36 doublet .",
    "a search and analysis of strong mgii absorption was carried out in several steps .",
    "first each spectrum was continuum fit red - ward of ly@xmath32  emission using a principal component analysis to fit the quasar emission lines and a b - spline algorithm to fit the underlying spectrum , which results roughly in a power - law with broad emission features .",
    "second , all @xmath37 features were identified using a gaussian filter method matched to the spectral resolution of the sdss data .",
    "this method works by convolving a gaussian with @xmath38pixels to both the flux and error arrays .",
    "the wavelengths where the convolved flux exceeds the convolved error array by 3.5 are considered significant absorption features and a line list is constructed for each quasar .",
    "each resulting line list was searched for pairs of absorption features with separation matching the mgii doublet . finally , the equivalent width of the mgii  2796 line was measured by directly summing the normalized flux .",
    "the equivalent width was measured by summing the difference between the continuum - fitted quasar flux and unity over a redshift centered box of width @xmath39    ( half the spectral distance between the rest mgii(2796 ) and mgii(2803 ) lines ) .",
    "this final step is dominated by systematic uncertainty ( in particular continuum fitting and contamination due to absorption by both systems at other redshifts and the sky ) , with an expected typical error of @xmath40   . to remove false - positives ,",
    "a visual confirmation was then made for each system with measured @xmath41   .    to check the completeness of the survey a monte - carlo test was run on a representative sample of quasars .",
    "artificial mgii systems were added to quasar spectra , which were then searched for absorption as described above .",
    "the artificial systems were varied in strength and redshift and the quasars were selected at random from the complete sdss - dr3 quasar sample .",
    "the results of this simulation are displayed in figure  [ fig : completeness ] .",
    "the solid line in the top panel reflect results for @xmath0    systems versus redshift .",
    "the @xmath42    results are displayed with a dashed line .",
    "the lower panel displays the @xmath7 of the systems as measured by the search algorithm versus the actual @xmath7 of the added system .",
    "the data have been binned and the values displayed are the average detected @xmath7 divided by the actual value , with the errorbars indicating the rms of the systems in each bin .",
    "this figure indicates that this technique of absorption detection is @xmath43 complete for @xmath0    systems , and provides fairly accurate measurements of @xmath7 , with typical errors of @xmath44   .",
    "a very small number of outliers in measured @xmath7 were detected in this analysis , primarily a result of sky - line blending due to small errors in the detected system redshift .",
    "this effect was observed in very few systems , and is ignored in the following analysis .",
    "there is a slight systematic elevation of measured @xmath7 versus the added @xmath7 , which is an effect of contamination by real absorption systems in a given spectra and is ignored in the following analysis . to further assess the completeness and accuracy of the search algorithm ,",
    "fifty random quasars were examined by eye . in this sample the automated search missed 2 out of 15 systems , each with @xmath45   ; the @xmath7 measurements of the automated search agreed well with this small sample of found systems . because of nyquist biasing , the number of discovered @xmath0    systems is expected to be inflated by @xmath46    systems included due to error in the measurement of @xmath7 .",
    "as the phenomena considered in this work have no specific cut - off in @xmath7 , and as the effect is likely to be small , this error is neglected in the following analysis .    in order to determine the number density of mgii systems , one must calculate the total redshift path density @xmath47 of the survey .",
    "large spectral regions , especially at higher redshifts , are highly contaminated by the sky .",
    "simply removing these regions from the analysis would greatly reduce the redshift pathlength available to this study , but it is important to properly account for those regions which are too unreliable to accurately discover mgii absorption . to account for this issue ,",
    "the search was limited to regions where the gaussian fitted ( @xmath48 = 1  pix ) signal - to - noise ( of the continuum ) @xmath2 per pixel , often resulting in non - contiguous search regions for a given quasar . the analysis of ss92 has been followed with a slight modification . for this work , instead of adding unity to a @xmath47 redshift bin for each spectrum which contains data for that bin , the decimal percentage of the given bin s redshift range actually covered in each spectra is added . because strong mgii systems dampen the noise of a spectra at their wavelength ( i.e.  poisson noise is a significant source of error ) , and the @xmath49 is calculated by dividing the continuum flux by the noise",
    ", the @xmath49 at the specific wavelength of a given system will tend to increase over the local average . to protect against over - counting mgii systems versus @xmath47",
    ", only systems discovered within regions in which the @xmath49 smoothed over a 50 pixel box was greater than 7 are considered for the following analysis .",
    "a plot of @xmath47 for the sdss search is presented in figure  [ fig : gzsdss ] . limiting the search to smoothed spectral regions of @xmath2 per pixel and a minimum @xmath7 threshold of @xmath50  ",
    ", a total of 6511 mgii systems were discovered , with 4835 of @xmath0   , 2594 of @xmath42    and 1329 of @xmath16   .",

    "the dotted line plotted in the figure represents a fit of a modified schecter function to the @xmath7 distribution , of the form @xmath57 , which is a much better fit to the data , particularly at high @xmath7 .",
    "the best fit values for this functional form are @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "it is likely that allowing the characteristic @xmath7 , @xmath60 , to be a fitted variable rather setting it to unity would improve the fit even further . because this value has no bearing on the following discussion , this fitting and its interpretation are left to future work .",

    "it should be noted that every spectrum in this data set contains a damped ly@xmath32  system ; these were ignored throughout the mgii analysis .    for each spectrum",

    "given the strength of this doublet , these systems are conspicuous . after identifying a mgii system ,",
    "its redshift , equivalent width ( mgii 2796 ) and velocity width were measured , and the spectrum was searched for absorption due to other transitions associated with the system . the velocity width ( @xmath65 ) calculation followed the analysis of @xcite , i.e. , the region bounding 90@xmath66 of the total optical depth in an unsaturated transition ( typically fe ii 2600 ) .",
    "the kinematic complexity of each system was also assessed , generally using complementary , non - saturated metal absorption lines ( e.g. feii 2600 ) .",
    "this measure is a simple summation of the distinct velocity components visible and was made due to the importance of absorption complexity to the arguments of bccv .",
    "because the esi spectra are of lower resolution than those taken with hires , the observed complexity is expected to be reduced .",
    "velocity structure will be lost for components separated by less than 45  km  s@xmath11 , especially in saturated absorption features . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectra are sensitive to structure in the velocity profiles for components separated by greater than @xmath67 .",
    "the redshift path density @xmath47 has been calculated in a similar manner as the sdss sightlines .",
    "the only significant difference is that spectral gaps inherent to the hires instrument add some uncertainty to this calculation .",
    "a possible prescription for accounting for the hires spectral gaps involves disqualifying those spectral areas immediately preceding and following the gaps , as only one half of the doublet is not enough to determine its nature . because the systems of interest in this work are quite strong and because the wavelength coverage allows for investigation and confirmation of systems based on other metal absorption lines ( e.g. fe ii ) , this prescription was not followed and only the hires spectral gaps large enough to hide both components of a mg ii absorption doublet were disqualified in the calculation of @xmath47 .",

    "the value of @xmath4  is sensitive to observational bias in several forms .",

    "indeed , this bias is of particular concern , as many of the systems in this sample will be associated with damped ly@xmath32systems @xcite and such systems may cause reddening in the spectra of background quasars @xcite .    following the analysis of @xcite to address the matter of gravitational lensing , two averaged bootstrap samples of quasars free of strong mgii absorption were created .",
    "the first of these samples was free of mgii absorption in the range of @xmath86    @xmath87   , the second of @xmath16     systems .",

    "indeed , two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov tests reveal no evidence of differing magnitude distributions between the absorption and non - absorption datasets in either @xmath7 bin , with ks probabilities ranging from @xmath115 .",

    "for now , we note that the effect of reddening would generally be to under - measure @xmath4 .",
    "the net effect could be a systematic shallowing of @xmath4 especially at @xmath12 , although the reddening is sufficiently small that the corrections to @xmath4  should be minor .",
    "the evolution of @xmath4  described by figure  [ fig : dndzsdss ] has several implications for the physical processes relevant to systems .",
    "first , the near constancy of @xmath4over the @xmath121gyr spanning @xmath122 to 0.8 indicates the cross - section to strong systems is very likely to be dominated by dark matter halos with masses @xmath123 .",
    "although structure forms much earlier in the @xmath124cdm cosmology than an einstein de sitter model , the number density of galaxies with @xmath125 increases exponentially over this epoch ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if these massive galaxies dominated the cross - section , then @xmath48 would have to decrease exponentially to yield constant @xmath4 .",
    "we consider such a coincidence to be highly unlikely .",
    "it is far more reasonable to physically associate the phenomenon with galaxies having mass @xmath126 and assume a nearly constant cross - section during this epoch .",
    "second , the decline in @xmath4  at @xmath6 indicates the cross - section to strong systems is decreasing in time .",
    "this conclusion applies particularly to the @xmath16  absorbers where the decrease in @xmath4  is secure . for the same argument as above , the number density of dark matter halos is either constant ( for @xmath127 ) or increasing substantially ( for @xmath128 ) .",
    "a decrease in @xmath4 therefore , can only be explained by a decrease in @xmath48 .",
    "the observations imply the processes responsible for strong absorbers are ` turning off ' at @xmath129 .",
    "third , one identifies a rough correspondence between the star formation history of the universe @xcite and @xmath4 . granted",
    "the two quantities track one another over the redshift range @xmath130 to 2 , it is tempting to connect the strong systems with processes related to active star formation ( e.g.  galactic winds , starbursts )",
    ".    we now examine the implications of the evolution of @xmath4  in terms of the two models described in the introduction : ( 1 ) a starburst scenario where the incidence and kinematics of strong systems are determined by feedback processes ( bcvs ) ; and ( 2 ) infalling gas in the outer halos of massive galaxies ( mm96 ) . an important prediction of the mm96 scenario is that @xmath4  should steeply decline at high redshift once the characteristic dark matter halo mass @xmath131 becomes smaller than the typical halo mass giving rise to strong absorption . in the mm96 scenario ,",
    "the halo mass is @xmath132 , which is necessary to insure the halo has a significant reservoir of cool , photoionized gas ( mm96 ) . within the @xmath124cdm cosmology with @xmath133 , @xmath134 at @xmath135",
    "therefore , this model predicts a steep decline in @xmath4  at @xmath12 which is not observed . as noted above , to adopt a model where strong absorption arises in an unevolving population of dark matter halos , the typical mass would need to be less than @xmath136 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the majority of strong absorbers do not arise in massive halos typical of the @xmath137  population at @xmath129 . in fairness",
    ", we note that the mm96 model was primarily introduced to explain the @xmath137 systems which may have a different origin than the strong absorbers considered in this paper .",
    "it is more difficult to compare the observations against the starburst scenario because there does not exist a well - developed model .",
    "nevertheless , consider the following arguments . at @xmath138 ,",
    "the dark matter halo merger rate is expected to scale as @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "if one assumes the starburst phenomenon is merger - driven , then the simple prediction is an increase in @xmath4  with increasing redshift .",
    "indeed , this is observed from @xmath139 to 0.8 , yet all of the sub - samples are inconsistent with even a @xmath140 increase in @xmath4  at @xmath12 . because the incidence is the product of the number density and cross - section of the halos , one could envision a scenario where @xmath48 is decreasing with redshift as @xmath141 increases such that @xmath4  remains roughly constant .",
    "for example , the mg abundance could be much lower at higher redshift or the velocity fields more quiescent , but these explanations are rather unlikely for a starburst model .",
    "recent observational results of @xcite suggest another possible solution .",
    "these authors find that the galaxy merger rate evolves much more shallowly with redshift than dark matter haloes , @xmath142 , a much better match to the observations .",
    "as noted above , the general trend of @xmath4  roughly tracks the global density of star formation .",
    "that is , the star formation rate ( sfr ) density is described as roughly constant from @xmath103 to 2 ( where it is not well constrained ) and decreases by a factor of several from @xmath103 to today .",
    "although the correspondence between the incidence of strong absorbers and the sfr density could be simple coincidence , it may be expected if the absorption systems arise from feedback processes related to star formation .",
    "the correspondence may suggest that significant star formation is required to maintain a large cross - section to strong absorption , i.e.  this phase is short - lived in galactic halos and requires continued input to maintain the observed incidence at @xmath103 to 2 . at the very least , we consider the similarity to be at least anecdotal evidence in favor of a starburst scenario .",
    "the actual value of the incidence of strong absorption  as opposed to its evolution  provides an important constraint on the hypotheses of massive galactic halos and starbursts .",
    "the phenomenology of mm96 implies a typical impact parameter for absorption of @xmath143  h@xmath11  kpc . using @xmath144 at @xmath138 , the value measured in this work for @xmath0    systems , a number density @xmath145  mpc@xmath76",
    "is measured for large , quiescent galaxies at this redshift .",
    "it should be recalled that the measured @xmath4  for at this redshift may be somewhat influenced by merging systems , so the value used for @xmath4  in this calculation should be considered an upper - limit . again assuming standard concordance cosmology and using the mass function introduced by @xcite , the mass of halos with @xmath146  mpc@xmath76 is @xmath147 .",
    "similar to our previous conclusions , we find that the mm96 scenario is nonviable at @xmath12 if one adopts their typical mass halo of @xmath148 unless one extends the impact parameter to an unlikely @xmath149kpc .",
    "turning to the starburst hypothesis of bccv , the observations can be used with previous work on superwinds and lbgs to constrain the required impact parameter of the outflows .",
    "if high redshift mgii systems do correspond to sb galaxies , one expects them to trace lbgs , also thought to harbor starbursts . using the measured number density @xmath150  mpc@xmath76 for lbgs at @xmath151 @xcite , and assuming the value of @xmath4  observed at @xmath122 for the @xmath27    sample ( @xmath152 ) , the predicted @xmath48 for merging mgii systems at @xmath153 is @xmath154 .",
    "the value of @xmath4  used in this calculation may be considered a maximum , as the overall sample of mgii systems discovered in this survey is likely to be polluted with large - scale processes , damped ly@xmath32 absorption systems , or other systems , and thus the resultant value of @xmath48 is also a maximum . to determine whether this value is consistent with the wind hypothesis , theoretical upper and lower bounds on @xmath48",
    "may be used . assuming a @xmath155 and a bubble age @xmath156 myr ( bccv , a lower limit equal to the expected time - scale of the sb )",
    ", the approximate impact parameter will be @xmath157 .",
    "the expansion time and velocity used for this calculation are both lower limits , so this is a lower limit .",
    "computer simulations presented in @xcite find the maximum size of these bubbles ( after very long evolutionary periods ) to correspond to @xmath158 .",
    "the gas in such large bubbles , however , may be of too low density to give rise to strong mgii absorption , so this should be considered an extreme upper limit . in any case , the cross - section determined from mgii absorption and lbg data is consistent with the theory that superwinds are the primary hosts of high redshift mgii absorption .",
    "examining the profiles in figure  [ fig : data ] , it is evident that the majority demonstrate at least one of the three criteria discussed in bccv for the identification of superwind driven galactic bubbles .",
    "because these features were clearly present in even the weaker @xmath7 systems , the bccv criterion of @xmath16    has been relaxed to @xmath74 .",
    "based primarily on unsaturated transitions ( usually a feii line ) , the majority ( @xmath75 80% ) of the discovered systems exhibit some degree of complexity , though as discussed above , kinematic features of width @xmath159 km  s@xmath11 are unobservable in the esi spectra . because every system discovered in a hires spectrum",
    "displays a great deal of spectral complexity , and as many of these features are kinematically closer than the above specified limit , it is probably a safe assumption that most or all of the systems studied in this work conform to the complexity criterion introduced out by bccv .",
    "figure  [ fig : delv ] presents a histogram of the velocity widths of the high resolution sample .",
    "clear is the cutoff at @xmath160 km  s@xmath11 which corresponds to the @xmath0   imposed on this study ( although recall that the @xmath65 measurements are based on unsaturated profiles ) .",
    "the velocities range from @xmath161 for the @xmath162 system toward q1331 + 17 to @xmath163 for the @xmath164 system toward pss2241 + 1352 , with the majority of systems having @xmath165 . in the idealized case of a spherical shell expanding with constant velocity @xmath166 ,",
    "the velocity width for an impact parameter of @xmath167 is @xmath168 .",
    "therefore , the median velocity width for this sample corresponds to a shell speed of @xmath169  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "this value is consistent , though on the low end , with numbers observed for local galactic superwinds @xcite and those predicted from numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "an important and somewhat unexpected result of this analysis is that very few mgii systems show @xmath170 km  s@xmath11 .",
    "if this gas is tracing winds arising from starburst systems , it is evident that the optical depth of rapidly expanding bubbles at @xmath171 is small : @xmath172 mpc@xmath11 ( 95% c.l . ) .    in one respect ,",
    "the data displayed in figure  [ fig : ions ] are generally unsupportive of the mg ii absorber - superwind hypothesis . in a wind model",
    ", one envisions a cold , expanding shell of gas which envelopes a rarefied , hot region which in turn surrounds the post - sb galaxy . in this scenario , one would not expect to observe high - ionization state particles ( e.g. si iv ) in the same distribution as the colder gas ( mg ii ; @xcite ) .",
    "one might expect the higher - ionization state gas to be distributed in a kinematically narrower region ( it is no longer expanding ) .",
    "alternatively , the gas may exhibit turbulent velocities at the virial velocity dispersion of the galaxy and not conform to the clump patterns of the gas in the shell . in either case",
    ", these trends are not observed in those systems with high - ionization lines .",
    "figure  [ fig : ions ] shows a clear trend for high- and low - ionization state gas to share the same regions of km  s@xmath11 space and to often display similar clumping patterns .",
    "this result is consistent with the work of @xcite , who reported strong kinematic links between mgii and civ absorption in the redshift range @xmath173 , and discussed consequences for both the above scenario and that proposed by mm96 , which involves cold bubbles of gas confined by pressure in a hot gas medium .",
    "the construction of mm96 also implies different kinematic situations for the hot and cold gas , a prediction not supported by the data .",
    "indeed , the models presented in mm96 predict that systems showing strong mgii absorption ( large galaxies ) should contain little if any civ absorption , which is clearly ruled out by the data .",
    "a suggestion put forward to fix this discrepancy is a `` warm '' phase of collisionally ionized gas in an interface between the cold bubbles and the hot medium .",
    "this would explain the observed kinematic link between mgii and more highly ionized species ( in either the expanding bubble or two - phase gaseous halo scenarios ) , though the authors point out that the amount of collisionally ionized civ found in such a phase would likely be small .",
    "there is also the possibility that civ arises at higher radii than the simple models of mm96 consider .",
    "this solution , while providing for more civ absorption , does not provide a simple explanation for the observed kinematic link between species .",
    "more sophisticated models of the two - phase halo structure are needed to clarify this issue .",
    "there are many open questions left in the task of assigning a particular phenomenology to strong absorption",
    ". detailed simulations of superwinds would be useful in pinning down the expected absorption profile of such a system , as well as providing information on expected metallicities and temperatures . a handful of strong mg ii absorption - selected galaxies have been studied kinematically ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with varying results , though the number remains small and little consideration has gone into the link stipulated in this work . a more comprehensive survey over",
    "a larger redshift range would allow for stronger statements regarding the correlation between these absorbers and galaxy populations , as well as a refined understanding of their kinematic nature .",
    "optical studies could only provide results at low redshift , but confirmation of the sb and post - sb nature expected of the hosting galaxies , even for low - z examples , would strengthen the argument considerably .",
    "adaptive optics might be useful here , and a program has been begun at lick observatory to obtain ao images of a few quasars known to harbor low redshift , strong systems in an attempt to morphologically identify these systems .",
    "we are also performing a separate imaging program with acs on the hubble space telescope ( cycle 14 ) to cover a wider range of redshift . finally , with the advent of infrared spectrographs ( e.g. the gnirs instrument on gemini south ) and the availability of large numbers of bright , high redshift quasars ( as in the sdss dr3 )",
    ", the phenomenon can be studied to very high redshift ( @xmath174 ) . in particular , it is critical to further test the assertion that strong systems trace processes related to star formation .    the authors wish to recognize and acknowledge the very significant cultural role and reverence that the summit of mauna kea has always had within the indigenous hawaiian community .",
