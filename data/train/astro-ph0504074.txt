    "the prominent molecular cloud / hii region complex ngc6334 at a distance of 1.7kpc is composed of a series of luminous star forming regions at various stages of evolution @xcite . during the initial radio and infrared studies completed over twenty years ago , a confusing family of nomenclature was introduced for this region .",
    "letters a - f refer to vla 6 cm continuum sources @xcite , while roman numerals i through vi refer to far - infrared sources @xcite .",
    "while each center of activity contains co hot spots and various masers , the youngest region appears to be radio source `` f '' ( which corresponds to infrared source `` i '' and iras source 171753544 ) located at the northeastern end of the complex .",
    "even the earliest far - infrared maps @xcite resolved the emission of source i into two cores : the sources i and i(n ) , which are separated by @xmath4 . with the cold dust emission ,",
    "only a few red infrared sources and weak cm continuum emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) , source i(n ) is considered to be the least evolved object in the region .",
    "a well - known , cometary compact hii region lies at the heart of source",
    "i ( e.g. , @xcite ) and contains associated oh masers @xcite , class ii ch@xmath0oh masers @xcite and h@xmath5o masers @xcite .",
    "recent mid - infrared imaging with oscir at the keck ii telescope has identified a candidate star ( irs1e ) for the excitation source of the compact hii region @xcite .",
    "single dish bolometer maps from jcmt reveal a compact ( @xmath6 ) strong ( sub)mm continuum source with an estimated dust temperature of 100k @xcite .",
    "a sest line - survey @xcite shows rich molecular line emission in the mm wavelength range similar to prototypical high - mass star - forming regions such as orion - kl .",
    "comparable results are obtained in a mini line survey near 345ghz @xcite .",
    "a co(21 ) outflow with a velocity range of @xmath7kms@xmath8 emanates from ngc6334i @xcite and a similar outflow is also seen in the h76@xmath9 and h92@xmath9 recombination lines @xcite .",
    "several knots of shock - excited h@xmath5 emission have been detected near the ends of this outflow @xcite along with nh@xmath0 ( 3,3 ) masers @xcite .",
    "the driving source(s ) for the outflow were claimed to be either the powering source of the uchii region , or an adjacent object .",
    "one candidate is the cold @xmath10 m source i : kdj2 located @xmath11 to the north - west of the uchii region ( as resolved by mirac2 at irtf ) , which is not seen at shorter wavelengths @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the powering source of the uchii region and i : kdj2 may both drive independent outflows .      similar to source i ,",
    "the jcmt bolometer maps show i(n ) to be a strong source of ( sub)mm continuum emission @xcite .",
    "the estimated dust temperature is lower around 30k . while source i is stronger than i(n ) in cs ( 54 ) @xcite and in cs ( 76 ) , the hc@xmath0n ( 1514 ) line is much stronger in i(n ) than in i @xcite .",
    "further differences can be seen in the 230 ghz line survey where the ch@xmath0oh bands ( at 240 - 242ghz and 250 - 252ghz ) are fainter in i(n ) than i @xcite , probably indicating a younger age for this region .",
    "similar conclusions were drawn by @xcite based on their smaller line survey and spectral line mapping of the two regions . indeed , in striking contrast to i , the i(n ) region shows no mid - infrared emission and only a few red infrared sources @xcite .",
    "traditionally , i(n ) has also been known as lacking cm continuum emission ; however , two faint ( @xmath12  mjy ) , compact cm sources have recently been detected with the vla @xcite .",
    "one object sits only @xmath13 from the ( sub)millimeter continuum peak , and is consistent with the ionizing radiation from a b2 zams star .",
    "this cm peak is associated with class ii ch@xmath0oh maser emission @xcite .",
    "furthermore , class i ch@xmath0oh maser emission has been mapped at 44ghz and shows emission peaks distributed over approximately @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "a bipolar outflow has also been mapped in the sio(21 ) and ( 54 ) transitions with the sest in south - east north - west direction approximately coincident with the distribution of the class i ch@xmath0oh maser at 44ghz @xcite .",
    "these authors also find independent evidence for outflow activity in h@xmath5 clumps , which are present but less pronounced than in source i.      because ngc6334i & i(n ) are close to each other   thus sharing a similar large - scale environment   but in different evolutionary stages , they are the ideal target sources to characterize the evolutionary differences in physical and chemical properties of massive star - forming regions .",
    "both sources have been thoroughly investigated at near / mid - infrared wavelength and at lower spatial resolution in the radio and mm regime ( with some already mentioned exceptions ) .",
    "however , high - spatial resolution molecular line and continuum studies from short cm to submm wavelength have been lacking so far because of its location in the southern hemisphere .",
    "this situation has changed over the last couple of years with the advent of the 12 mm and 3 mm systems at the australian telescope compact array ( atca ) and the dedication of the submillimeter array ( sma ) .",
    "therefore , we started a combined effort to investigate the molecular line and continuum emission from 12 mm to the submm regime employing both instruments . here , we present the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) and the ch@xmath0oh ( near 25ghz ) results from the atca , whereas a separate paper outlines the first sma results toward these sources at 217ghz ( hunter et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "the sma data show three mm continuum sources toward ngc6334i , two of them adjacent to the uchii region and one approximately coincident with the cm continuum peak ( hunter et al .  in prep .",
    ") . toward ngc6334i(n )",
    ", they detect another mm continuum peak ( a few arcsecond offset from the cm - peak ) with a little bit of more extended emission .",
    "these mm peak positions will be compared with our nh@xmath0 and ch@xmath0oh emission throughout this paper .",
    "furthermore , hunter et al .",
    "( in prep . ) detect very collimated sio(54 ) outflows in ngc6334i & i(n ) , and the outflow orientation in both sources is approximately the same in the north - east south - west direction .",
    "it is important to mention that the new outflow in ngc6334i(n ) is approximately perpendicular to the previously observed larger - scale outflow @xcite .",
    "the sources ngc6334i & i(n ) were observed on july 6th and 7th of 2004 with the australian telescope compact array ( atca ) in the compact 750d configuration with 5 antennas and a baseline range between 31 and 719 m .",
    "antenna 6 was also included , resulting in a maximum projected baseline of @xmath15 km .",
    "the phase reference centers are given in table [ center ] .",
    "the observed lines are the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) inversion lines , with the frequencies of the main hyperfine components at 23.695ghz and 23.723ghz , and one spectral setup at 24.932ghz covering three ch@xmath0oh lines at 24.9287ghz ( ch@xmath0oh(@xmath16)e ) , 24.9335ghz ( ch@xmath0oh(@xmath17)e ) and 24.9344ghz ( ch@xmath0oh(@xmath18)e ) .",
    "in addition , we observed the cm continuum emission with one spectral unit covering a bandwidth of 128mhz centered at 22.08ghz .",
    "a good uv - coverage was obtained through regular switching between both sources and the three spectral setups .",
    "the spectral resolution of the observations was 16khz corresponding to a velocity resolution of @xmath19kms@xmath8 .",
    "the primary beam of the atca at the given frequency is @xmath20 .",
    "the data were reduced with the miriad package . applying a robust weighting of 1 ( closer to natural than uniform weighting , thus stressing the shorter baselines )",
    "the synthesized beam is @xmath21 .",
    "we smoothed the data to 0.5kms@xmath8 channels , and the rms per 0.5kms@xmath8 is @xmath22mjy .",
    "the rms of the 22ghz continuum and some of the velocity - integrated line maps are partly slightly higher , mainly because of more pronounced side - lobe effects due to the strong emission features .",
    "the @xmath23 values are given in each figure separately .",
    "the spatial distribution of the molecular gas is significantly different between ngc6334i and ngc6334i(n ) ( figures [ ngc6334i_images ] & [ ngc6334in_images ] ) . toward ngc6334i , we find strong thermal , compact nh@xmath0 and ch@xmath0oh emission in close proximity to the uchii region .",
    "in contrast , the nh@xmath0 emission toward ngc6334i(n ) exhibits very extended emission without a compact component , and we find no thermal ch@xmath0oh feature but only strong maser emission .",
    "the nh@xmath0 and ch@xmath0oh emission from ngc6334i shows two emission peaks a few arc - seconds offset from the uchii region ( fig .  [ ngc6334i_images ] ) .",
    "the low - level molecular emission terminates at the edge of the uchii region , thus we have an example of an observed edge - on orientation between an uchii region next to a hot core .",
    "the two molecular line peaks are coincident with two of the three mm continuum peaks observed by hunter et al .",
    "( in prep . ) with the sma .",
    "interestingly , the molecular line peaks are of the same intensity whereas the north - eastern mm - peak has about 2.5 times the continuum flux than the south - western mm - peak .",
    "another difference between the two peak positions is that the north - eastern peak is associated with h@xmath5o maser emission @xcite whereas the south - western peak exhibits class ii ch@xmath0oh maser emission @xcite .",
    "more ch@xmath0oh , h@xmath5o and oh maser emission is found at the interface between the molecular core and the uchii region .",
    "furthermore , we detect extended nh@xmath0(1,1 ) emission south - west of the two peak positions .",
    "this extended emission is significantly weaker in the nh@xmath0(2,2 ) line and is barely detected in ch@xmath0oh .",
    "it is in the same direction as the molecular outflow observed in co by @xcite and more recently in sio by hunter et al .",
    "( in prep . ) .    the spatial distribution of the nh@xmath0 gas we have observed varies considerably from the previously reported vla map by @xcite . with a spatial resolution of @xmath24",
    ", they detected more extended emission and their peak intensity position is @xmath25 south of ours . tapering our data to the same lower spatial resolution , we recover most of their extended structure , but our peak positions remains coincident with the two peaks shown in figure [ ngc6334i_images ] . due to the large number of antennas at the vla ( 27 versus 6 at the atca ) , their uv - coverage should be good and allow a reasonable recovery of the large - scale structure , but the offset of their peak position remains a puzzle .",
    "however , our data are less sensitive to large - scale emission and therefore trace the small - scale cores far better . additionally , the exact coincidence of our nh@xmath0 and ch@xmath0oh peak positions with the mm peaks reported by hunter et al .",
    "( in prep . )",
    "give additional confidence to the small - scale gas core distribution presented in figure [ ngc6334i_images ] .",
    "furthermore , considering the multiple sources we find in ngc6334i and the now known outflow in the region @xcite , the disk - interpretation of the nh@xmath0 data by @xcite does not hold anymore , and it is more likely that their observed large - scale emission is somehow associated with the outflow as well .",
    "we do not detect any compact thermal nh@xmath0 or ch@xmath0oh emission toward ngc6334i(n ) ( fig .  [ ngc6334in_images ] ) .",
    "however , the extended nh@xmath0 emission has about the same peak intensities as ngc6334i but is distributed over a large area ( @xmath1 ) without a distinct peak position .",
    "the mm peak detected by hunter et al .",
    "( in prep . )",
    "is located approximately at the center of the large - scale nh@xmath0 core .",
    "the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) emission has a similar spatial distribution as the nh@xmath0(3,3 ) emission previously reported by @xcite .",
    "while we do not detect any thermal ch@xmath0oh emission , we find class i ch@xmath0oh maser emission from the ch@xmath0oh(@xmath16)e  and ch@xmath0oh(@xmath17)e  lines ( nothing from the ch@xmath0oh(@xmath18)e  line ) .",
    "both lines show a maser component at @xmath26kms@xmath8 , but the ch@xmath0oh(@xmath17)e  line exhibits another maser component at @xmath27kms@xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ ngc6334in_ch3oh_spectrum ] ) .",
    "the spatial position of the @xmath28kms@xmath8 components are approximately @xmath13 north - east of the mm - peak in the direction of the collimated sio outflow , whereas the @xmath29kms@xmath8 component is located about @xmath30 south of the mm - peak ( the exact positions are given in table [ maserpos ] ) .",
    "the observed peak brightness temperature of the @xmath28kms@xmath8 line is @xmath31k ( fig .",
    "[ ngc6334in_ch3oh_spectrum ] ) .",
    "the @xmath29kms@xmath8 component is less clearly associated with one of the two outflow axes , but both components are spatially close to previously detected class i ch@xmath0oh@xmath32 44ghz maser positions @xcite .",
    "we note that there are significantly fewer , just two , 25ghz maser components detected than 44ghz components .",
    "the 23 maser spots observed in the latter line are spread over an area of @xmath33 , which is somewhat larger , but comparable to the @xmath34 separation of the 25ghz components .",
    "the positional offsets between the 44ghz and the 25ghz maser positions may be due to the loss of absolute positional information during self - calibration of the 44ghz data by @xcite .",
    "performing gaussian fits to the ch@xmath0oh data in the image plane , we get slightly extended features compared to the beam size .",
    "this indicates unresolved spatial blending of different maser components within each channel width of 0.2kms@xmath8 .",
    "nh@xmath0(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines are widely used as thermometers in molecular clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ ngc6334i_nh3_spectra ] shows nh@xmath0(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) spectra toward the two nh@xmath0 peak positions overlayed with fits to the hyperfine structure .",
    "the hyperfine structure line fits were performed in class ( part of the gildas software package ) assuming a gaussian velocity distribution , equal excitation temperatures and the theoretical intensity ratio and spacing between main and satellite hyperfine lines .",
    "the fitted parameters are the excitation temperature , the opacity of the main hyperfine component , the line - width and the @xmath35 .",
    "obviously , the flat - topped fits do not reproduce the observed spectra well which is likely due to an extremely high optical depth and varying excitation conditions over the width of the lines .",
    "missing flux due to missing short spacings does not play a significant role since we sample large - scale emission in ngc6334i(n ) ( fig .  [ ngc6334in_images ] ) and the uv - coverage of both observations is nearly the same .",
    "these fits do not allow us to derive accurate temperatures .",
    "therefore , we tried to work only with the satellite hyperfine components of the spectra , and figure [ ngc6334i_hf ] presents the integrated emission maps of the outer satellite hyperfine components at the most negative velocities ( the blend of the nh@xmath0(1,1)@xmath36 & @xmath37 lines at @xmath38ghz and the nh@xmath0(2,2)@xmath39 line at @xmath40ghz ) . in the following ,",
    "we refer to these lines as the ( outermost ) satellite hyperfine ( hf ) components .",
    "an intriguing difference between the integrated nh@xmath0(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) satellite hyperfine structure line maps is that the ( 1,1 ) satellite hf - line shows a similar peak intensity distribution as the ( 1,1 ) main hf - line whereas the ( 2,2 ) satellite hf - line shows an additional intensity peak a few arc - seconds south directly at the western edge of the uchii region peak .",
    "a ( 2,2)/(1,1 ) hf - ratio - map between the two integrated hf - maps stresses this difference as well ( figure [ ngc6334i_hf ] , right panel ) .",
    "the peak nh@xmath0(2,2)/(1,1 ) hf - ratios at this position are @xmath41 in contrast to ratios of @xmath42 toward the two main peak positions .",
    "the energy levels of the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines are 23 and 64k above ground , and this line - pair is mainly sensitive to temperatures below 50k . as shown by @xcite ,",
    "rotational temperatures derived from nh@xmath0(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) line observations are not sensitive to kinetic temperature changes above about 50k . therefore ,",
    "nh@xmath0(2,2)/(1,1 ) hf - ratios @xmath43 are of no use for temperature estimates .",
    "this is the case for both mm - peak positions as well as the additional ( 2,2 ) hf - peak close to the uchii region ( fig.[ngc6334i_hf ] ) .",
    "however , we observe nh@xmath0(1,1 ) peak brightness temperatures @xmath44k toward the two mm peak positions , and these brightness temperatures can be considered as lower limits for the kinetic temperatures at these positions .",
    "as the ( 2,2)/(1,1 ) hf - ratio toward the additional ( 2,2 ) hf - peak is significantly higher ( @xmath41 ) , the temperatures there should be higher as well .",
    "while it is likely that massive protostellar objects at the center of the two mm - peaks are causing the high temperatures there , the hot spot close to the uchii region is probably being caused by heating of the uchii region itself .",
    "the energy levels above ground for the three ch@xmath0oh lines are between 28 and 44k , thus these lines can not be used for more accurate temperature determinations as well .",
    "the situation is different in the outflow region , and we can extract reasonable nh@xmath0(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) spectra toward the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) outflow - associated peak at offsets ( @xmath45 ) . fitting the whole hyperfine spectra at this position , we can derive a rotational temperature of @xmath3k ( for details on the temperature calculation from nh@xmath0 observations , see , e.g. , @xcite ) . at these low temperatures , rotational temperatures",
    "correspond well to kinetic temperatures @xcite .      since we have no well defined nh@xmath0 peak position in ngc6334i(n ) , we extracted spectra toward the mm peak position determined by hunter et al .",
    "( in prep . ) , which is offset by @xmath46 from our phase reference center .",
    "the brightness temperatures are comparable to the brightness temperatures in the southern source ngc6334i but the opacities are lower as observed in the lower hyperfine line strengths ( especially in the ( 2,2 ) lines , figure [ ngc6334in_nh3_spectra ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can fit these lines reasonably well and again derive rotational temperatures as done previously for the outflow position .",
    "the derived nh@xmath0 rotational temperature is @xmath47k corresponding to kinetic temperatures @xmath48k @xcite .",
    "thus , again we can derive only lower limits for the temperatures toward ngc6334i(n ) .",
    "this estimate based on the high - spatial resolution interferometric observations is significantly higher than previous estimates of 30k from single - dish nh@xmath0 observations with a beam size of @xmath49 @xcite , because the latter observations averaged over the whole region .",
    "the striking edge - on orientation between the uchii region and the molecular peaks in ngc6334i allows a closer analysis of possible kinematic signatures the uchii region might impose on the molecular cores ( in addition to the heating effect we have described in  [ ngc6334i_peak ] ) .",
    "figure [ ngc6334i_hf_pv ] shows two position - velocity ( pv ) cuts performed for the nh@xmath0(2,2 ) : ( a ) in east - west direction from the uchii region through the nh@xmath0(2,2 ) hyperfine emission hot spot , and ( b ) from the uchii region in north - western direction through the main mm and nh@xmath0 peak position . while there is considerable structure in the east - west pv - diagram ( a ) , it however does not reveal any clear signature that the uchii could have imposed on the molecular gas .",
    "the other pv - diagram ( b ) shows no strong velocity gradients from the uchii region in the direction of the nh@xmath0 peak position as well .",
    "figure [ ngc6334i_mom2 ] presents the moment 2 maps ( velocity dispersion maps ) of the two nh@xmath0(1,1 ) & ( 2,2 ) outermost satellite hyperfine lines and one of the ch@xmath0oh lines . while the velocity dispersion of the ( 1,1 ) hf - line peaks toward the north - eastern nh@xmath0 peak , the ( 2,2 ) velocity dispersion peaks further south toward the uchii region and the nh@xmath0(2,2 ) hyperfine hot spot .",
    "in contrast , the moment 2 map of ch@xmath0oh shows two peaks both associated with the two molecular peak positions .    at estimated temperatures of @xmath50k the critical densities of the ch@xmath0oh lines",
    "are of the order @xmath51@xmath52 , whereas the critical densities of the nh@xmath0 lines are lower ( of order @xmath53@xmath52 ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the higher density tracer ch@xmath0oh is dominated by internal motion due to the embedded protostars . to some degree",
    "this is also the case for nh@xmath0 , and especially the ( 1,1 ) moment 2 maps peaks toward the strongest mm continuum peak .",
    "however , there is no obvious ( 1,1 ) velocity dispersion peak toward the secondary mm peak position .",
    "the nh@xmath0(2,2 ) velocity dispersion is clearly dominated by the nh@xmath0(2,2 ) hyperfine hot spot close to the uchii region . since nh@xmath0 has lower critical densities than ch@xmath0oh , its line emission shows comparably less contribution from the densest cores , and it is thus more likely to exhibit temperature and kinematic signatures imposed by the adjacent uchii region .",
    "in addition to the molecular line emission , there are prominent ch@xmath0oh line absorption features observed in all three lines toward the uchii region in ngc6334i ( fig .",
    "[ ngc6334i_ch3oh_spectra ] ) . examining the nh@xmath0 data",
    ", we find no absorption in the satellite hyperfine lines but weak nh@xmath0 absorption features in the two main lines .",
    "position - velocity cuts of one of the ch@xmath0oh and the two nh@xmath0(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) main lines through the uchii region at @xmath54dec.=0 reveal that the absorption features are blue - shifted with regard to the ( weak ) emission features toward the uchii region .",
    "this signature is more pronounced in the ch@xmath0oh and nh@xmath0(1,1 ) line whereas it is not obviously discernible in the nh@xmath0(2,2 ) line .",
    "nevertheless , these data indicate expanding molecular gas around the uchii region .",
    "the differences between the two massive star - forming regions ngc6334i & i(n ) in their molecular nh@xmath0 and ch@xmath0oh emission are rather astonishing : compact thermal emission is observed in both species toward the uchii region / hot core ngc6334i whereas extended nh@xmath0 and masing ch@xmath0oh emission is found toward ngc6334i(n ) .",
    "it is not entirely obvious what is causing these differences because both sources harbor compact mm continuum sources as well as jet - like sio outflows ( hunter et al . in prep . ) .",
    "since the southern source ngc6334i has a uchii region , it is likely that evolutionary processes are at least partly responsible for the different molecular signatures .",
    "however , with the data obtained during the present investigation we still can not accurately determine temperature and density in both regions , and one expects that the molecular emission is sensitive to these parameters .",
    "therefore , it is an important next step to get thorough estimates of the characteristic temperatures and densities of both regions to get a deeper understanding of the physical processes causing the observational differences .",
    "figure [ overview ] presents a large - scale overview of the north - eastern end of the ngc6334 region comprising ngc6334i , ngc6334e and ngc6334i(n ) .",
    "it is interesting that within 1pc distance we find four different evolutionary stages of massive star formation : the shell - like hii region ngc6334e , the champagne - flow - like uchii region ngc6334i and its adjacent outflow driving mm cores , and further north the enigmatic source ngc6334i(n ) .",
    "ngc6334e lies just outside each of our primary beams , thus we have no new data about this source .    from an evolutionary point of view , the shell - like hii region ngc6334e appears to be the most evolved and thus oldest source within the region ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the uchii region ngc6334i is significantly smaller than ngc6334e and thus apparently in an earlier evolutionary stage ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "based on the cold dust temperatures , the detection of only a few very red infrared sources and weak cm emission @xcite , ngc6334i(n ) was always considered to be the youngest region within the large - scale ngc6334 complex . however , comparing the mm continuum / nh@xmath0 sources in ngc6334i with those in ngc6334i(n ) , it is not entirely obvious which of these two regions is evolutionary younger .",
    "both complexes have compact mm dust continuum sources and drive collimated outflows .",
    "in contrast to these similarities , the differences in the compact versus extended nh@xmath0 emission and thermal versus maser ch@xmath0oh emission at 24.9ghz are striking .",
    "furthermore , the differences in the estimated dust temperatures are large with 100k for ngc6334i and only 30k for ngc6334i(n ) @xcite . contrary to this , even constraining only lower limits for the gas temperatures based on our nh@xmath0 observations , we derive kinetic gas temperatures @xmath55k for both regions .",
    "even considering the different beam sizes of the scuba observations of the dust emission ( between @xmath56 and @xmath57 depending on the frequency ) and our nh@xmath0 gas observations , the dust and gas temperatures in ngc6334i appear to be consistent with each other , whereas this is not the case for ngc6334i(n ) .",
    "there , the gas and dust temperatures appear to have decoupled .",
    "additionally , @xcite estimated the bolometric luminosities of both sources to differ by about two orders of magnitude with @xmath58l@xmath59 and @xmath60l@xmath59 for ngc6334i & i(n ) , respectively .",
    "this difference could either imply that ngc6334i(n ) may not form a cluster as massive as ngc6334i , or ngc6334i(n ) may be less evolved and younger than ngc6334i and thus may still build up its final larger luminosity . with the observations",
    "so far , we can not clearly judge which of these two regions is in an earlier evolutionary stage . with the uchii region and the infrared cluster present , the whole region ngc6334i is older than the region ngc6334i(n ) , but it is less clear whether the same conclusion holds for the mm / nh@xmath0 cores within ngc6334i .",
    "however , it is worth mentioning that the non - detection of compact nh@xmath0 emission toward the mm sources in ngc6334i(n ) is a rarely observed phenomenon and may indicate a short - lived period during the evolution of massive star - forming regions .",
    "figure [ 6334i_hf_spectrum ] shows a spectrum of the outermost satellite hyperfine component of the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) line in the uv - domain on the shortest baseline of 31 m .",
    "several velocity components are present : one centered at @xmath61kms@xmath8 , one at @xmath62kms@xmath8 , one at @xmath63kms@xmath8 , and one at @xmath64kms@xmath8 . analyzing the spatial distribution of the different velocity components ( figure [ 6334i_hf_channel ] )",
    "we find that only the @xmath65kms@xmath8 component is clearly associated with the south - western nh@xmath0 emission peak , whereas all other features are associated with the north - eastern peak ( which is also the peak of stronger mm continuum emission ) .",
    "contrary to the complex profile in the uv - domain ( figure [ 6334i_hf_spectrum ] ) , the hyperfine components of the spectra taken individually toward each peak position resemble single - peaked gaussians ( figures [ ngc6334i_nh3_spectra ] & [ ngc6334in_nh3_spectra ] ) .",
    "we conducted gaussian line - fits to the outermost satellite hyperfine components of the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) line toward the two nh@xmath0 peak position in ngc6334i and the mm peak position in ngc6334i(n ) , and the derived line - widths @xmath66 vary between 4.1 and 5.1kms@xmath8 ( see table [ linewidths ] ) .",
    "what is causing these broad line - widths , turbulent motion due to , e.g. , molecular outflows , or organized motion due to , e.g. , infall , envelope rotation , disks , or multiple components ? @xcite",
    "have shown that the nh@xmath0 linewidth observed with single - dish telescopes toward high - mass protostellar objects ( hmpos ) is significantly lower than toward typical uchii regions and hot cores ( @xmath67kms@xmath8 versus @xmath68kms@xmath8 ) . since we find gas temperatures of the order 100k , ngc6334i & i(n )",
    "are considered to be part of the hot core group . therefore , most likely the large line - widths are an evolutionary signature of the hot core stage and no remnant from the original molecular core .",
    "the thermal linewidth at 100k is only 0.31kms@xmath8 and thus non - thermal motion has to account for nearly all the observed linewidth . to estimate the corresponding energy within the core we calculated @xmath69 with @xmath70 the core mass derived from the mm continuum emission ( hunter et al .  in prep . ) and @xmath71 the non - thermal linewidth component .",
    "the derived energy values corresponding to internal motion are of the order @xmath72erg ( see table [ linewidths ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the typical energy supply of massive molecular outflows is of the same order ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the spatial scales for the molecular outflows are usually of the order 1 parsec whereas the nh@xmath0 line - widths observed toward ngc6334i are confined to a few thousand au , thus the estimated energies are not directly comparable .",
    "however , the uncertainties in deriving outflow energies are usually high , up to an order of magnitude ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and it might be possible that comparable amounts of energy could be supplied from the outflow on spatial scales as small as the nh@xmath0 cores .",
    "therefore , turbulence caused by molecular outflows may contribute to the observed linewidth in ngc6334i .",
    "contrary to this , @xcite find broad nh@xmath0 line - widths of the order 5kms@xmath8 toward two young massive star - forming regions , whereas the nh@xmath0 emission in the surrounding cores has a narrower linewidth of the order 2kms@xmath8 .",
    "these observations are interpreted as indirect evidence for rotating disks within these massive star - forming regions .",
    "since we are unable to derive any systematic velocity gradient within the separate cores of ngc6334i , we can not attribute our observations to a disk scenario .",
    "however , it is likely that the observed line - widths are caused at least to some degree by organized motion within the inner few thousand au caused by either infall , envelope rotation , disks or multiple components , or an interplay of various of these components .",
    "only higher angular resolution observations can disentangle all these contributions .",
    "in contrast to ngc6334i , the situation appears to be different in ngc6334i(n ) because the nh@xmath0 emission is not confined to the mm peak position , and we observe broad line - widths over a large spatial area .",
    "since there are at least two molecular outflows in the region , the broad linewidth could well be caused by shock interactions of the outflow with the surrounding molecular core .",
    "additional evidence for outflow - shock interactions is the detection and the spatial spread of the class i 25 and 44ghz ch@xmath0oh maser emission which is believed to be caused by the interactions of outflows from massive star - forming regions with the surrounding cloud cores ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "class i ch@xmath0oh maser observations at 95ghz in dr21 revealed that they are located at the interface of the molecular outflow and the surrounding ambient gas @xcite .",
    "similar results were found for class i ch@xmath0oh maser emission near 25ghz in the orion - kl region , where @xcite suggest that the class i maser emission is formed behind shock fronts between the outflows and the dense cloud gas .    in the case of ngc6334i(n ) , the north - eastern 25ghz maser feature ( the @xmath28kms@xmath8 component ) is obviously spatially associated with the jet - like sio(54 ) outflow ( hunter et al .  in prep .",
    ", e.g. , fig .",
    "[ ngc6334in_images ] ) , and thus fits well into the shock - excitement picture .",
    "the southern 25ghz maser ( the @xmath29kms@xmath8 component ) is less clearly associated with one of the two outflow axes .",
    "however , the north - west south - eastern outflow of @xcite is significantly less collimated than the newly detected sio jet of hunter et al .",
    "( in prep . ) ,",
    "and therefore it is plausible that the class i maser features near the southern @xmath29kms@xmath8 maser peak ( i.e. , 25 and 44ghz masers ) are associated with the interface of the broader outflow cone and the ambient cloud . comparing the overall spatial distribution of the 25 and 44ghz class",
    "i ch@xmath0oh maser emission with the present outflow morphologies ( see fig .  [ ngc6334in_images ] ) all maser features appear to be associated with the outflows and are likely caused by the shock - interactions of the outflows and the ambient gas .",
    "the class i ch@xmath0oh masers in ngc6334i(n ) thus show the same behavior as masers of this kind in many other regions : first , individual narrow - line maser components are spread over areas of several tenths of a parsec , offset from any possible exciting source .",
    "additional evidence places them in the interaction zones of outflows and dense ambient gas .",
    "second , apart from perhaps orion - kl , masers in the 44ghz transition are always stronger than those in any of the 25ghz lines , and frequently the strongest of all class i ch@xmath0oh masers .",
    "this can be understood from the ( collisional ) pumping mechanism of class i methanol masers , which produces efficient masing in the 25ghz lines over just the range of physical parameters one may expect in the scenario described above ( leurini , menten , & schilke 2005 , in prep . ) .",
    "this means that possible 25 ghz emission from many of the spots from where 44 ghz emission arises may be too weak to be detectable .",
    "the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) & ( 2,2 ) and ch@xmath0oh observations of the two massive twin cores ngc6334i & i(n ) reveal significantly different emission signatures between both regions . while ngc6334i shows strong , compact thermal emission in the observed nh@xmath0 and ch@xmath0oh lines adjacent to the uchii region and coincident with mm continuum peaks observed by hunter et al .",
    "( in prep . ) , there is no compact thermal line emission toward ngc6334i(n ) . here , we find that the nh@xmath0 emission is distributed over a broad area of size approximately @xmath73 . no thermal ch@xmath0oh emission is found toward ngc6334i(n ) but we do detect two class i ch@xmath0oh maser peaks with peak brightness temperatures of @xmath31k . the two maser peaks may be spatially associated with 44ghz class i ch@xmath0oh maser emission and are likely produced in the interfaces between the molecular outflows and the ambient gas .",
    "nh@xmath0 peak brightness temperatures @xmath44k toward the mm - peak positions in ngc6334i & i(n ) indicate kinetic temperatures of the same order .",
    "the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) & ( 2,2 ) lines are only suitable as a good thermometer below 50k and thus we can not derive more than a lower limit for the temperatures in these regions . directly at the western edge of the uchii region we find a hot spot where the line ratios between the nh@xmath0(2,2 ) and ( 1,1 ) outermost satellite hyperfine components are surprisingly high around 4 , indicating even higher temperatures .",
    "since this position is not associated with any mm continuum peak , the heating is likely caused by the uchii region .",
    "nh@xmath0 emission is also detected toward the outflow in ngc6334i , and we can estimate a rotational temperature of approximately @xmath74k there .    toward the uchii region in ngc6334i we observe ch@xmath0oh and nh@xmath0 absorption .",
    "the absorption features are blue - shifted with regard to the emission features close - by .",
    "this signature is consistent with expanding molecular gas around the uchii region .",
    "we do not find additional strong kinematic effects imposed from the uchii region on the adjacent molecular cores ."
