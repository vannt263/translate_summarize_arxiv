    "the analysis of circular orbits ( both time and lightlike ) around an isolated massive source had always been an important tool to determine its physical parameters .",
    "for example in newtonian gravity , the kepler ",
    "law @xmath3 for circular orbits in the field of a central attracting body allows to determine its mass  parameter @xmath4 . in the slightly generalized form @xmath5 with @xmath6 it led to the assumption of dark matter in the halo of galaxies",
    "the same argument holds also in einstein s gravity for spherically  symmetric and static spacetimes .",
    "its description is slighty more involved , being based on an effective potential .",
    "however at least in a cosmological context it is necessary to include the effects of expansion ( possibly accelerating ) , thus leading to time  dependent metrics and preventing the applicability of the effective potential method . for a possible explanation of the anomalies in the trajectories of the pioneer probes ,",
    "such effects have been studied from diverse perspectives .",
    "however they are far too small to be relevant in the context of the standard theory .",
    "in fact , a careful analysis of the probe geometry revealed that the acceleration anomaly can be explained away by a thermal effect .",
    "nevertheless , these studies also revealed some lack of understanding of what is meant by a `` circular orbit '' in the field of a time ",
    "dependent , but spherically  symmetric metric .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to propose a geometric definition of the notion of circular orbit valid in this more general setting .",
    "this definition is substantiated by the possibility to formulate a corresponding stability ",
    "criterium .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ conv_nots_sec ]",
    "the basic notation and conventions are established . in section  [ metric_sec ]",
    "the equatorial metrics are defined . in section  [ circ_orbs_sec ]",
    "the notion of circular orbit is introduced geometrically . in section  [ result_sec ]",
    "the fundamental results for the existence and stability for circular orbits are formulated and proved both for timelike and lightlike orbits . in section  [ static_sec ]",
    "the static case is analyzed in some detail . in section  [ exmp_sec ] some examples",
    "are analyzed ( including time ",
    "dependent ones ) before concluding with a discussion of our results in section  [ disc_sec ] .",
    "although a generalization to spherically  symmetric spacetimes with dimension @xmath7 and @xmath8 would be straightforward , we will deal exclusively with @xmath9 and lorentz ",
    "signature @xmath10 . later on we will restrict to a corresponding `` equatorial '' spacetime with @xmath7 and the induced metric .",
    "our orbits are primarily timelike geodesics  lightlike geodesics will be dealt with briefly separately .",
    "as our problem is fundamentally geometric , we well use extensively the conventional geometric index  free notation . as far as possible",
    "we will follow the conventions and notations of oneill , 2006  @xcite , with the following major exceptions .",
    "perhaps less well  known are the useful `` musical isomorphisms '' @xmath11 and @xmath12 between vectors @xmath13 and one  forms @xmath14 , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , and and its inverse @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , corresponding to the frequent `` lowering '' and `` raising '' of a simple index with the metric tensor .",
    "this notation keeps visible the geometric origin either as a vector or as a 1form .",
    "in addition we will denote the contraction between a vector @xmath13 and a 1form @xmath19 with the dot  operator to a scalar by @xmath20 . with respect to the first ( from the left ) free vector slot of the tensorial object @xmath19 ] ,",

    "civita connection expressed by the usual metric  based christoffel ",

    "we use a unit system based on powers of the light  year ( ly ) .",
    "both gravitational coupling constant @xmath32 and velocity of light @xmath33 will be set to  1 .",
    "the spherical symmetry of the metric allows the line  element to be expressed in the following _ canonical form _",
    "( e.g. de felice and clarke , 1990  @xcite ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the standard line",
    " element on the unit 2dimensional sphere , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are functions only of @xmath38 .",
    "note that in this decomposition , the radial coordinate @xmath39 ( sometimes called `` areal radius '' ) is defined uniquely as the square  root of the coefficient of @xmath35 .",
    "evidently there is the discrete reflection isometry @xmath40 .",
    "this isometry is frequently used to motivate the restriction to the equatorial plane when considering geodesics ( e.g. frolov and zelnikov , 2011  @xcite ) .",
    "a more refined consideration is to base it directly on the separability of the geodesic equation ( e.g. chandrasekhar , 1983  @xcite ) .",
    "here we want to indicate briefly its geometric origin by showing that the equatorial submanifold is totally geodesic .    by lemma [ kb_lemma ]",
    "there is the identity @xmath41 , where @xmath42 denotes one  half of the lie  derivative of the induced metric @xmath43 along the normalized normal vector @xmath44 , @xmath45 denotes the extrinsic curvature , and @xmath46 .",
    "using local coordinates , with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , we have @xmath50 and so the extrinsic curvature also vanishes , @xmath51 . therefore the equatorial submanifold is _ totally geodesic _ , implying in particular , that any geodesic in it is also a geodesic in the original manifold .",
    "as we deal exclusively with geodesics in the equatorial plane , we could restrict all the following considerations to the three  dimensional _ canonical equatorial metric _",
    "( i.e. the induced metric ) with line element @xmath52 where @xmath53 are functions of @xmath54 only .",
    "more generally , if the dependency of a spherically symmetric metric on @xmath55 is only through @xmath56 and @xmath57 , there is reflection symmetry , and again @xmath58 .",
    "this is the case for the axially  symmetric metrics with mirror  symmetry , like the kerr  metric .",
    "also it will be convenient to allow some extra redundancy by introducing a more general radial coordinate than the areal radius , like in most cosmological metrics .",
    "therefore our analysis will deal more generally with the _ generalized equatorial metric _ , with line ",
    "element @xmath59 where besides @xmath60 and @xmath61 also @xmath33 and @xmath62 are functions only of @xmath54 .",
    "is usually denoted by @xmath63 , the canonical equatorial metric is hard to achieve  if at all ] evidently there is a remaining angular symmetry given by the killing  vector @xmath64 .",
    "a systematic analysis of circular orbits for general spherically  symmetric time ",
    "dependent spacetimes seems not to have been done yet save for very particular cases .",
    "sometimes ( e.g. sultana and dyer , 2005  @xcite ) , the notion of `` circular orbit '' is bound to the constancy of some `` radius '' along the trajectory . for a time ",
    "dependent spacetime this can at most be achieved by some isolated orbits .",
    "this is of course not enough to establish kepler  like relations e.g. in the form @xmath65 ( @xmath66 : tangential velocity ) .",
    "another approach is to consider `` quasi ",
    "circular orbits '' as defined by circular orbits in a static setting perturbed by cosmological dynamics ( faraoni and jacques , 2007  @xcite ) . at the other extreme",
    "is the approach of nolan , 2014  @xcite establishing the boundedness of the orbits , which asymptotically for large times approach circular orbits .",
    "however this has been shown only for some particular mcvittie spacetimes .",
    "also this would not be sufficient to obtain kepler  like relations .    here",
    "we propose a characterization of circular orbits in between these extremes , making essential use of the remaining angular symmetry provided by the killing ",
    "vector @xmath64 .",
    "consider a congruence of non  radial trajectories ( not necessarily geodesic ) with tangent @xmath67 .",
    "the symmetry is imposed by the condition @xmath68 .",

    "the hypersurface  property can be also expressed as @xmath74 .",
    "our notion of `` circularity '' will be therefore defined by the following differential conditions encoding the symmetry both for @xmath67 as well as for @xmath75 , @xmath76= 0 , \\\\",

    "b ) serves only to prevent @xmath81 to be a timelike killing  vector .    these conditions are still independent of any geodesy of @xmath67 , here expressed by @xmath82 .",
    "to take it into account , it will be convenient to introduce also the notion of the _ extrinsic curvature _ @xmath83 of a ( nowhere lightlike ) hypersurface  @xmath69 .",
    "this object encodes the deviation between the induced connection in the hypersurface  @xmath69 and the connection in the ambient manifold . in the literature",
    "several different but closely related notions are used for this  e.g. in oneill , `` shape tensor '' , `` shape operator '' and `` second fundamental form '' .",
    "the `` second fundamental form '' frequently also goes under the name of extrinsic curvature . following frankel , 1998  @xcite ( 11.51 ) we define it by means of gauss equation , @xmath84 where @xmath85 are any vectors in the submanifold @xmath69",
    ", @xmath86 denotes the induced connection and @xmath87 the vector corresponding to the normalized normal one  form  @xmath75 .",
    "there is a useful relation to the lie  derivative along @xmath87 of the induced metric @xmath43 which we express in the following     + [ kb_lemma ] for vectors @xmath85 orthogonal to the normalized one ",
    "form @xmath75 normal to @xmath69 with induced metric @xmath43 , there is the identity @xmath88 * proof * + decomposing the induced metric into @xmath89 , we have the identity @xmath90 where @xmath91 and we used @xmath92 .",
    "again by orthogonality we can discard the @xmath93terms , so that by orthogonality @xmath94 using gauss equation  ( [ gauss_eq ] ) , again by orthogonality finally we get the claimed result .",
    "@xmath95    note that for a spacelike hypersurface @xmath96 and so this definition agrees in this case with the one given e.g. in wald , 1984  @xcite and in carroll , 2004  @xcite .",
    "the above nine conditions are still independent of the geodesy of @xmath67 , and could refer to any congruence of vectors . note that the geodesy of any trajectory with tangent @xmath27 in @xmath69 , @xmath97 ( a vectorial equation ) , implies @xmath98 ( a scalar equation ) .",
    "but the converse is not true  evidently from @xmath98 follows only @xmath99 .",
    "however assuming circularity , there is a converse when taking into account angular  momentum conservation .",
    "this is expressed in proposition [ prop ] and its corollary .",

    "the analysis of the stability of our circular orbits is thus reduced to the analysis of the stability of a linear nonautonomous dynamical system .",
    "unfortunately the results of the stability theory for autonomous dynamical systems do not carry over .",
    "the appropriate mathematical notions are not as easy to apply and are outside the scope of this paper . only in the static case",
    "it could be considered an autonomous dynamical system , with associated two  dimensional phase ",
    "space , where the stability ",
    "behaviour is well  known . on static spacetimes ]      although lightlike circular orbits are known to exist isolated e.g. at the boundaries of the ranges for timelike circular orbits , smooth congruences of such orbits can not be excluded beforehand . with slight modifications similar results on existence and stability",

    "however the corresponding corollary [ coro ] gets slightly modified , the j  equation reducing to @xmath169 where @xmath119 again is the ( unmodified ) mean curvature of @xmath69 .",
    "similarly , the statements on stability continue to hold for lightlike orbits , when properly taking into account the redefined @xmath167 .",
    "in particular for the canonical equatorial metric the angular frequency of the perturbation then simplifies to @xmath170",
    "here we consider explicitly static metrics in the sense of @xmath171 and @xmath153 in the region of interest .",
    "although in this case our algorithm is ( as of course it should ) completely equivalent to the very well  known algorithm based on the effective potential , it is more directly applicable .",
    "for example , in this case the fundamental j  equation of equation  ( [ j_eqn ] ) is immediately solved by the simple algebraic relation @xmath172 assuming @xmath173 the necessary and sufficient condition for @xmath174 is either @xmath175 the local tangential velocity with respect to the static observers @xmath176 , @xmath177 note that as long as @xmath137 remains timelike and @xmath132 , then @xmath178 .",

    "recapitulating , the conditions for existence and stability of circular orbits in a static spherically symmetric metric are just the two conditions @xmath132 and @xmath185 , where @xmath187 is defined by equation  ( [ j2_eqn ] ) .",
    "energy conservation is not invoked at all .",
    "this sets our algorithm apart from the conventional one where an effective potential @xmath188 has first to be set up , and where the constant parameters @xmath189 have to be chosen so that for a particular  @xmath39 , the three conditions @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 are satisfied . also the direct physical interpretability of @xmath0 vs. @xmath13 has the advantage of a better contextuality  after all we are dealing primarily with a problem having angular symmetry .",

    "so the standard gravitational tests can not fix the value of @xmath335 , except when going to the near  field , where @xmath336terms become appreciable .",
    "let us first calculate the local circular velocity ( with respect to static observers ) for the buchdahl  metric .",
    "our static j ",
    "algorithm immediately gives @xmath337 which in fact up to @xmath338terms seems to coincide with the circular velocity corresponding to an effective schwarzschild ",
    "mass @xmath339 . however , for the proper existence of the velocity ( i.e. bound circular orbits ) , we must in addition assume @xmath340 .",
    "this restricts the general hmn ",
    "solution to solutions where the `` naked mass '' @xmath4 has the same sign as the parameter @xmath327 .",
    "in fact , as shown by buchdahl , there is a discrete isometry @xmath341 between the apparently different metrics .",
    "therefore , we will restrict in what follows to the `` physical metric '' with parameters @xmath342 and @xmath333 .",
    "now to the approximate solution for the hmn  metric .",
    "noting that this metric is conformally related with factor @xmath343 to the above static buchdahl ",
    "metric , this suggests the following ansatz @xmath344 where the functions @xmath60 and @xmath33 are taken from the corresponding static buchdahl ",
    "metric with @xmath340 . inserting this ansatz into the j ",
    "equation  ( [ j_eqn ] ) shows that it is satisfied up to @xmath345terms  more precisely up to @xmath346 , where again @xmath347 and @xmath348 .",
    "taking again the andromeda galaxy as an example , the approximate distance where our approximation begins to break down is @xmath349 .",
    "this is many orders of magnitude higher than the extent of our observable universe estimated to be @xmath350 ( slightly below the hubble ",
    "radius @xmath351 ) .",
    "and one of the biggest known cosmological structures , the local laniakea supercluster , has an radial extent of @xmath352 , with about @xmath353 galaxies ( @xmath354 ) .",
    "the breakdown radius is reduced to @xmath355 , which is still significantly higher than the extent of our observable universe ( even when allowing a mass  factor of 10 for interstellar gas and radiation ) .",
    "therefore for all practical purposes , even for the biggest known structures , for this particular cosmological model based on the hmn ",
    "solution , we can safely ignore the @xmath356 and any higher  order terms .    in particular , even that the angular  momentum function @xmath0 is subject to the hubble  flow with factor @xmath343 , the velocity @xmath66 with respect to a coexpanding observer is essentially _ time  independent_. this can immediately be seen as follows .",
    "first we get , up to ignorable @xmath357terms , using equation  ( [ t_def ] ) , @xmath358 as in the static case of equation  ( [ j2_eqn ] ) .",
    "then , up to ignorable @xmath357terms , @xmath359 this is _ exactly _ the expression of the velocity of equation  ( [ v2_buch ] ) for the corresponding static buchdahl ",
    "of course , this hmn ",
    "metric is very special in that it is not only conformally static , but also in that the squared cosmological scale  factor is linear in time .",
    "a slight generalization where our approximation still works would consist in taking an arbitrary power of the above scale  factor  however the corresponding field equations would not anymore be satisfied",
    ". therefore the validity of our approximation referring to the hmn ",
    "metric must be considered as fortuitious .  trying to conventionally solve the relatively complex geodesic equation ,",
    "this approximate solution would hardly have been found .",
    "this again shows the superiority of the j  based approach .",
    "let us emphasize again that we could of course have done the static analysis in section  [ static_sec ] using the conventional approach based on an effective potential .",
    "however here we calculated the relevant quantities in a more transparent and shorter way using only @xmath187 and its first derivative .",
    "in fact , the usefulness of the angular  momentum function seems not to have been recognized so far .",
    "however , the full potential of our approach would only be revealed when analyzing effectively time ",
    "dependent metrics , like inhomogeneous isotropic cosmologies .",
    "in particular , our approach would allow to find out if the asymptotically flat galactic rotation curves could be understood as a manifestation of some dynamic gravitational effects  without invoking either dark matter or milgrom s phenomenological mond  theory .",
    "unfortunately such cosmological models can not be analyzed analytically , except when exact solutions to the j  equation can be found , which is highly improbable .",
    "nevertheless , appropriate approximate solutions to the j  equation could be constructed . a simple cosmological model with a massive point  source was analyzed as an example , where an adapted approximation method could be applied .",
    "however the asymptotic behaviour for @xmath360 of the circular velocity in this model was practically undistinguishable from the schwarzschild case  no hint for an asymptotically constant nonzero velocity .",
    "perhaps more realistic such cosmological models will be needed .",
    "this is left for future work .",
