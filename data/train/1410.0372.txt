    "the earlier is established through the chemical composition of the system , while the latter extracts additional information about the dynamical evolution and collective flow .",
    "the hadron multiplicities and their correlations are observables which can provide information about nature , composition , and size of the medium from which they are originating .",
    "furthermore , establishing thermalization is an essential condition in order to raise detailed questions about the equation of state , the underlying dynamics and the change in the effective degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , the extent to which the components of produced mater interact with each others , and finally chemically and thermally freeze out , is an ultimate goal of the high - energy experiments .",
    "the properties of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions of high energy density represent another fundamental goal of the physics program with the ultra - relativistic heavy  ion collisions .    with the huge progress in operating high - energy experiments",
    ", it turns to construct suitable canonical ensembles to incorporate exactly the charge conservation for a given dynamical system as a key tool in the high - energy collisions . in context of quantum statistical mechanics , one implicitly wanted to build fock spaces of states which are characterized by defined symmetry properties of prescribed charges . in su(2 ) symmetry , the energy and total spin dependence of the single  particle density of states in the nuclear fermi - gas mode has been calculated .",
    "about six decades ago , micro  canonical calculations taking into consideration four - momentum conservation have been presented . a general approach to calculate the phase volume",
    "was implemented in order to study the consequences of including momentum conservation in the relativistic collisions .",
    "the statistical description of particle production in high  energy nuclear interactions dates back to 1948 , when heinz koppe published his paper entitled : ",
    "die mesonenausbeute beim beschuss von leichten kernen mit alpha  teilchen [ german ]  or  meson yields from bombarding light nuclei with alpha particles [ english ]  in zeitschrift fr naturforschung .",
    "koppe introduced an almost complete recipe for statistical - thermal models .",
    "particle production ( mesons or lightest goldtone modes ) , formation and decay of resonances , temporal and thermal evolution of the interacting system , approaches applying either fermi - dirac or bose - einstein or stefan - boltzmann statistics in thermal medium and under equilibrium condition in the final state of the nuclear interaction were implemented .",
    "furthermore , koppe estimated the equilibrium concentrations of each type of the produced particles    in 1950 , fermi introduced a statistical theory based on the assumption that in multiple processes occurring in high - energy collisions there is a localization of the energy in a small spatial volume which then decays into various possible final states .",
    "the decay is conjectured to be compatible with the constant motion relative a priori probabilities proportional to their statistical weights .",
    "thus , the fermi model is preferably applicable in energy range compared with that of the cosmic rays . at the lower end of this energy range , the model becomes unreliable , because only a few final states are accessible and their details are important at the higher end . because of insufficient consideration of peripheral interactions , deviations likely occur at low energy .",
    "this should be restricted due to conservation laws .",
    "conservation of the charges , baryon number and strangeness was studied within the thermodynamical model of high - energy hadronic collisions .",
    "as _ dictated _ in koppe model , the particle production in fermi model is treated by means of statistical tools , here weights .",
    "furthermore , fermi model gives a generalization of the _  statistical model ",
    "_ , in which one starts with a general cross - section formula and inserts into it a simplifying assumption about the matrix element of the process , which reflects that many features of the high - energy reactions dominated by the density in phase space of the final states .",
    "the final states are accessible from the given initial state under the consideration of all conservation laws .",
    "therefore , the formulation of fermi model is sufficiently general to allow an application to many different processes such as nucleon - antinucleon annihilation , and the production of pions and strange particles in meson - nucleon and nucleon - nucleon ( _ elementary _ ) collisions .",
    "a general description for the quantum statistics in high - energy collisions with a variable number of ideal ( non - interacting ) particles was introduced by magalinski and terletskii .",
    "the generalization extends to an aggregate of oppositely charged particles , for which the conservation laws are fulfilled .",
    "expressions for total number of particles and for the total energy are deduced .",
    "they are distinguishable from the ordinary quantum statistics . in almost all implications of the statistical - thermal methods , charge conservation",
    ", the underlying symmetry corresponds to one or several unrelated u(1 ) groups should be respected .",
    "this apparently means that in order to obtain the total charge of a many - particle state , the charges of the constituents can be simply added .",
    "there is an increasing interest in gauge theories based on various non - abelian internal symmetries , which was introduced by yang and mills .",
    "the phase transition of strongly interacting matter has been intensively studied for many years . already in fifties of last century , long before the discovery of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , there have been first speculations about a possible new phase of strongly interacting matter , based on studies of the thermodynamics of a hadron resonance gas .",
    "pomeranchuk came up with an assumption that a finite hadron size would imply a critical density above which the hadronic matter can not be in the compound state , known as hadrons . in 1964 , hagedorn introduced the mass spectrum in order to characterize the abundant formation of hadron resonances with increasing masses and rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "accordingly , the mass spectrum formulated the concept of limiting temperature based on the statistical bootstrap model .    in 2003 , the statistical - thermal model has been confronted to the lattice qcd simulations .",
    "details about the critical conditions near deconfinement were possible .",
    "the lattice qcd calculations suggest that this transition should be a true transition only in small quark mass intervals . in a broad intermediate quark masses",
    "regime the transition is not related to any singular behavior of the qcd partition function .",
    "nonetheless , it still is well localized and characterized by rapid changes of thermodynamic quantities in a narrow temperature interval .",
    "the transition temperature thus is well defined and determined in the lattice qcd calculations through the location of maxima in response functions such as the chiral susceptibility .    at critical temperature , the additional degrees of freedom carried by the quark - gluon plasma , the new state of matter , are to be released resulting in an increase in the thermodynamic quantities like energy and pressure densities .",
    "this was physical picture before 2003 .",
    "the success of statistical - thermal model in reproducing lattice qcd results at various quark flavors and masses ( below @xmath1 ) changed this picture drastically .",
    "instead of releasing additional degrees of freedom at @xmath2 , the hadronic system increases its effective degrees of freedom , namely at @xmath3 . in other words ,",
    "the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) has much more degrees of freedom than qgp .    since the pioneering work of 2003 , a wide spectrum of applications has absolved the statistical - thermal models . in this review",

    "<S> we review some recent highlights from the applications of statistical - thermal models to different experimental measurements and lattice qcd thermodynamics , that have been made during the last decade . </S>",
    "<S> we start with a short review of the historical milestones on the path of constructing statistical - thermal models for heavy - ion physics . </S>",
    "<S> we discovered that heinz koppe formulated in 1948 an almost complete recipe for the statistical - thermal models . in 1950 , enrico fermi generalized this statistical approach , in which he started with a general cross - section formula and inserted into it simplifying assumptions about the matrix element of the interaction process that likely reflects many features of the high - energy reactions dominated by density in the phase space of final states . in 1964 , hagedorn systematically analysed the high - energy phenomena using all tools of statistical physics and introduced the concept of limiting temperature based on the statistical bootstrap model . </S>",
    "<S> it turns to be quite often that many - particle systems can be studied with the help of statistical - thermal methods . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of yield multiplicities in high - energy collisions gives an overwhelming evidence for the chemical equilibrium in the final state . </S>",
    "<S> the strange particles might be an exception , as they are suppressed at lower beam energies . however , their relative yields fulfil statistical equilibrium , as well . </S>",
    "<S> we review the equilibrium statistical - thermal models for particle production , fluctuations and collective flow in heavy - ion experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we also review their reproduction of the lattice qcd thermodynamics at vanishing and finite chemical potential . during the last decade , five conditions have been suggested to describe the universal behavior of the chemical freeze out parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the higher order moments of multiplicity have been discussed . </S>",
    "<S> they offer deep insights about particle production and to critical fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we use them to describe the freeze out parameters and suggest the location of the qcd critical endpoint . </S>",
    "<S> various extensions have been proposed in order to take into consideration the possible deviations of the ideal hadron gas . </S>",
    "<S> we highlight various types of interactions , dissipative properties and location - dependences ( spacial rapidity ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , </S>",
    "<S> we review three models combining hadronic with partonic phases ; quasi - particle model , linear @xmath0-model with polyakov - loop potentials and compressible bag model .    @pre@post </S>"
