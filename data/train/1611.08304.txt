    "it is widely believed that a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) resides at the central part of most massive galaxies , and the mass of smbhs ( @xmath1 ) reaches up to @xmath2@xmath3 ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , scaling relations have been observed between the smbh mass and physical properties of their host galaxies , regardless of agn activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , suggesting that smbhs and galaxies evolved with a close interaction ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , the physics behind the co - evolution is unclear , preventing us from full understandings of the cosmological evolution of galaxies and smbhs .",
    "the gas accretion onto smbhs is a fundamental process to explain the origin of the huge luminosity of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . since agns are often associated with the star formaiton in their host galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , agns are a key population to explore the smbh - galaxy co - evolution .",
    "more recent works suggest that agn activity is important to quench star formation in their host galaxies ( the negative agn feedback ; see , e.g. , @xcite ; cf . for positive agn feedback ,",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite ) then the quenching of the star - forming activity is expected to terminate the agn activity .",
    "therefore the agn feedback is now regarded as a crucial process for the smbh - galaxy co - evolution .",
    "outflows are often considered as one of the agn feedback mechanisms .",
    "the velocity profile and shift from the systemic velocity of various absorption and emission lines observed in uv and optical spectra of agns suggest the presence of the strong outflow of ionized gas , that exist in both small spatial scales corresponding to the broad - line region ( blr , that is located at the sub - pc scale from the nucleus ) and large spatial scales corresponding to the narrow - line region ( nlr , that is located at @xmath2@xmath4 pc from the nucleus ) @xcite . not only the ionized gas , powerful outflows of molecular gas at the scale of their host galaxies are also seen in sub - millimeter and millimeter spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the inferred kinetic power of agn outflows is high enough ( @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 ; e.g. , @xcite ) that a large amount of ism in agn host galaxies can be blown away , resulting in the termination of the star - formation activity . however , the detailed properties and physical origin of the agn outflow are not understood well , and thus further observational studies on the agn outflow is crucial to reveal the nature of the agn feedback .",
    "though the agn outflow is seen in various spatial scales as described above , the blr has been particularly investigated to examine the nature of the agn outflow . especially high - ionization emission lines from blrs such as c  iv@xmath71549",
    "are interesting for assessing the blr outflow .",
    "this is because those high - ionization lines are emitted from the closer region to the agn central engine than low - ionization lines , such as mg  ii , as suggested by reverberation mapping observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "in fact , the c  iv  emission line sometimes show significant blueshifts @xcite or asymmetric velocity profiles @xcite than low - ionization blr lines .",
    "it has been also reported that the outflow properties in blrs are also related to the eddington ratio ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in terms of the smbh - galaxy co - evolution ,",
    "the relation between the agn outflow properties and the metallicity is specifically important because the metallicity is strongly linked to the past star - formation history of the host galaxy .",
    "@xcite reported the close relation between the blr metallicity ( @xmath8 ) and agn outflow through the analysis of the c  iv  emission - line profile in a sdss high-@xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) qso sample , and concluded that the past star formation in galaxy could affect both the accretion activity and the agn outflow in the blr scale .",
    "there is a limitation in the observational studies of the agn outflows ; the blr outflow has been explored often for high - redshift qsos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is because high - ionization blr lines such as c  iv  are in the rest - frame uv and thus they are not observable from ground - based telescopes .",
    "the lack of systematic studies of the blr outflow at low - redshift universe prevents us from examining the redshift evolution of the outflow , that is crucial to understand the role of agn feedback within the context of the smbh - galaxy co - evolution in the cosmological timescale .",
    "another motivation for the blr outflow study in low - redshift agns is from the expectation that the basic properties and physics of the agn outflow could be different between high redshift and low redshift , since the typical gas fraction of host galaxies is expected to be completely different between high - redshift and low - redshift agns @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented rest - frame uv spectra of 70 low - redshift ( @xmath11 ) pg qsos for investigating the relation between @xmath8 and agn properties such as the smbh mass , agn luminosity , and eddington ratio .",
    "this sample is extremely useful also for studying the nature of the blr outflow in low - redshift agns , especially for examining possible relations between the outflow activity and the metallicity in the blr scale .",

    "therefore , in this work , we use low - ionization lines for determining the systemic redshift .",

    "second , we mask out narrow absorption lines present in some targets .",
    "third , we adopt a double gaussian profile , which well reproduces the observed blr emission lines . here",
    "we assume that both gaussian components are originated from the blr since the velocity width of the narrower gaussian component is wider than 1500 km s@xmath6 in most cases , while the contribution of the nlr emission to the civ profile seems not significant as we do not detect them in our fitting analysis .",

    "for comparison , the median value of those parameters given in @xcite for high - redshift qsos are 0.5 ( ai ) , -898 km s@xmath6 ( vsi ) , and 0.63 ( bai ) . while the measured ai and bai of our sample are similar to those of the high - redshift qso sample of @xcite , the vsi values of our sample are systematically smaller than those of @xcite .",
    "the reason for this systematic difference may be owing to the difference in the sample selection ( see  5.1 ) . to examine the reliability of the measured bai and the relation between bai and the other indicators ( ai and vsi ) , we compare the three outflow indicators in figure 2 .",
    "the different colors of symbols in this figure denote different narrow lines used for determining the systemic redshift .",
    "we do not find any systematically different behaviors for different color symbols , suggesting that the difference in the narrow lines used for the redshift determination does not cause significant systematic effects in the outflow indicators .",
    "therefore we combine all of the data obtained from different reference lines in the following analysis and discussion . figure 2 shows that there is a clear correlation between bai and vsi , while there is no apparent correlation between bai and ai . to investigate whether or not there are statistically significant correlations among the outflow indices , we conduct spearman s rank - order correlation test with the null hypothesis that there are no correlations among the outflow indices .",
    "this null hypothesis is not rejected for the relation between bai and ai ( @xmath394 ) , while it is rejected for the relation between bai and vsi with a high statistical significance ( @xmath395 ) .",
    "this result is partly because the typical measurement uncertainty in ai is much larger than the standard deviation of the ai distribution ( see the left panel in figure 2 ) .",
    "it is thus inferred that the ai parameter is not an adequate indicator for the agn outflow , at least for our sample .",

    "note that the eddington ratio of the sample of @xcite distributes in the range of @xmath399 , i.e. , @xmath21 dex higher than the eddington ratio distribution of our sample .",
    "this difference is a natural consequence of the sample selection in the sense that high - redshift sdss quasars are luminous enough to be selected in the magnitude - limited sdss spectroscopy .",
    "the systematically smaller vsi in our sample than in the sample of @xcite mentioned in  4.1 is probably attributed by this @xmath21 dex difference in the eddington ratio distribution between the two samples .    in figure 3 ,",
    "possible dependences of the two outflow indicators ( bai and vsi ) on the agn properties ( @xmath1 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 ) are investigated .",

    "however in the center and right panel , the two outflow indicators appear to show positive correlations with the agn bolometric luminosity and eddington ratio , in the sense that agns with a higher luminosity or a higher eddington ratio tend to show stronger outflows . for examining the statistical significance of these possible correlations ,",

    "the rank - order test suggests that the correlations between bai and the metallicity indicators are very marginal with low statistical significance ( @xmath406 ) . though the statistical significances of correlations between vsi and the metallicity indicators are slightly higher ( @xmath407 ) than the correlations for bai , but not very tight .",
    "these results seem contradictory to the earlier results for high redshift qsos reported by @xcite , who showed a tight correlation between the outflow strength and metallicity in blrs . for this comparison",
    ", it should be noted that the analysis by @xcite is based on stacked sdss spectra of 12844 high - redshift qsos while our analysis is based on individual sdss spectra of 34 low - redshift agns",
    ". a significantly larger number of objects in the study of @xcite makes the statistical error very small .    for investigating whether our results are consistent with those of @xcite",
    ", we present the relation between bai and ( si  iv+o  iv])/c  iv  high - redshift qsos in figure 4 ( dashed line in the upper middle panel ) .",
    "although the dispersion in our sample is large , the results of @xcite and ours show similar trend .",
    "this is interesting since the difference in the cosmic age between our sample at @xmath408 and the sample of @xcite at @xmath409 is more than half of the hubble time but still these two samples show a similar trend in the relation between the outflow indicator and metallicity indicator .",
    "as described in  4.2 , the ai parameter does not work well for quantifying the outflow strength for our sample .",
    "this is attributed to the narrow range of the ai distribution .",
    "it is interesting to notice that highly asymmetric c  iv  lines are selectively seen in radio - loud qsos @xcite . the small range of the ai distribution in our sample may be attributed to the fact that there are not so many radio - loud agns in the pg sample @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported a significant correlation between ai and bai , based on their high - redshift sdss qso sample whose ai distributes in the range of @xmath410 .",
    "however , the ai distribution of their sample concentrates mostly in the range of @xmath411 , and actually the wide ai range is achieved owing to the large sample size .",
    "therefore , the small sample size of ours ( lacking radio - loud agns especially ) is not adequate to investigate the ai distribution and various ai - related correlations . as for the bai and vsi parameters",
    ", vsi shows tighter correlations with agn properties including the blr metallicity than bai as shown in  4.2 and  4.3 .",
    "this is possibly affected by the large uncertainty in ai that introduce the corresponding uncertainty in bai .",
    "another potential concern for our sample selection is the removal of bal agns .",
    "the bal features are caused by powerful outflows of ionized gas , and thus possibly agns with a strong outflow may be selectively removed from our sample .",
    "this concern may not be true , if the fast ionized outflow is ubiquitous in agns and the bal features are observed just due to the orientation effect ( i.e. , we see the bal features only in @xmath210% of type-1 agns because the covering factor of the ionized outflow is @xmath210% ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare the outflow indices ( ai , vsi , and bai ) between bal agns and non - bal agns to understand the nature of the bal phenomenon in agns ; however we do not further discuss this issue because it is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "+      the correlations among the outflow , metallicity , and eddington ratio seen in our sample suggest their physical connection in low - redshift agns .",
    "it suggests that the gas radial motion ( i.e. , the gas accretion onto the smbh and the outflow from the nucleus ) is related to the metallicity in the nuclear region .",
    "the relation between the metallicity and the gas accretion has been reported for qsos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and also for nearby seyfert galaxies especially focusing on the metallicity difference between narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies and broad - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this can be interpreted as the result of the starburst - agn connection ; i.e. , the nuclear starburst activity enriches the gas in the nuclear region and also triggers the gas accretion onto the smbh . on the other hand , the relation between the agn outflow and",
    "the eddington ratio has been also discussed , in the sense that the gas accretion results in the increase of the agn luminosity that causes the outward radiative pressure to the surrounding gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". therefore the correlations among the outflow , metallicity , and eddington ratio are reasonable characteristics in agns .",
    "in addition , a more direct reason causing the positive correlation between the gas metallicity and the outflow is that the gas with a high metallicity ( and with a high dust abundance consequently ) has a larger optical depth .",
    "therefore such metal - rich clouds are more easily affected by the outward radiative pressure .",
    "also , the resonant scattering could contribute to the outflow .",
    "if the resonant scattering exerts radiation pressure , higher metallicity gas has higher optical depth in the resonance scattering , that leads to more powerful outflow .",
    "interestingly , our results for low - redshift ( @xmath0 ) qsos and those for high - redshift ( @xmath412 ) qsos show a similar trend , even though these two studies examine completely different cosmic epochs .",
    "this suggests that the physics of the gas accretion onto the smbh and its relation to the nuclear star formation is universal through the cosmic timescale .    on the other hand ,",
    "the smbh mass does not show a significant correlation with the outflow . the correlation coefficients are 0.25 for low - redshift qsos and -0.39 for high - redshift qsos @xcite .",
    "this implies that the smbh mass itself is not an important factor for nuclear activities such as nuclear star formation and outflow .",
    "this interpretation is consistent to the recent work by @xcite , reporting that there is no statistically meaningful correlation between the smbh mass and the blr metallicity .",
    "+      the powerful agn outflow is sometimes seen also in the nlr .",
    "@xcite showed that the [ o  iii ]  emission ( a relatively high - ionization nlr line ) in some agns shows a blue shift with respect to other low ionization narrow lines , such as [ s  ii ] .",
    "since it is known that high - ionization nlr clouds ( emitting [ o  iii ] ) locate more inner parts in the nlr than low - ionization nlr clouds emitting such as [ s  ii ] , [ o  i ] , and [ o  ii ]   @xcite , it is naturally expected that high - ionization nlr lines more frequently show outflow features than low - ionization nlr lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". then a question naturally arises  is there any physical connection between blr outflows and nlr outflows ? in terms of the gas metallicity",
    ", some earlier works reported the physical connection between gas clouds in nlrs and blrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in these works , it is inferred that the outflowing blr gas affects the chemical property in the nlr . therefore , it is highly interesting to examine possible physical link between the blr outflow and nlr outflow .",
    "this can be studied by investigating the outflow indices for c  iv  and those for [ o  iii ] .    to investigate a possible link between the blr outflow and nlr outflow , we focus on the outflow indices for [ o  iii ]  and compare them with the outflow indices for c  iv   in our low - redshift agn sample .",
    "figure 5 shows the results of the comparison of vsi between [ o  iii ]  and c  iv .",
    "here we derive the vsi by adopting different references for the systemic redshift ; h@xmath52 , [ o  i ] , [ o  ii ] , and [ s  ii ] , for checking the robustness of the inferred results .",
    "there is no apparent correlation between the vsi of [ o  iii ]  and c  iv , regardless of the adopted redshift reference .",
    "the spearman s rank - order correlation test also suggests that there is not statistically significant correlation between them ( the exact results of the rank - order correlation test are given in figure 5 ) .",
    "however the obtained results do not necessarily mean that the blr outflow and nlr outflow is independent , because the sample size of our low - redshift agns is so small that the covered range of the [ o  iii ]  vsi is very limited ( from 150 km s@xmath6 to + 250 km s@xmath6 roughly ) .",
    "the studies of [ o  iii ]  in the literature typically focus on the wing component , which represents the non - gravitational kinematic signature , finding evidence of strong outflows @xcite . on the other hand the velocity shift of [ o  iii ]",
    "is reported to be relatively small @xcite .",
    "thus , our comparison of blr and nlr outflows based on the velocity shift may not reveal a strong trend .",
    "the comparison of the outflow kinematics between [ o  iii ]  and c  iv  for much larger samples with detailed line profile analysis will be an interesting test to understand a possible link between the blr and nlr outflows .",
    "to understand the agn gas outflow at the blr of low - redshift agns , we derive agn outflow indicators of 34 low - redshift agns by analyzing the c  iv  velocity profile and by adopting the systemic redshift defined by some low - ionization narrow emission lines such as [ s  ii ]  and [ o  i ] . by comparing the measured outflow indicators with various agn properties , the following results are obtained .",
    "the outflow indicators ( vsi and bai of c  iv ) show weak positive correlations with the eddington ratio , bolometric luminosity , and blr metallicity indicators , suggesting that there is a connection among the past star formation , accretion , and agn outflow in the nuclear region of host galaxies . however , there are little correlation between the blr outflow indicators and the smbh mass .",
    "the inferred relation among the blr metallicity , eddington ratio , and blr outflow , seen in our low - redshift agn sample , is consistent with that seen in high - redshift qso sample @xcite .",

    "<S> outflows in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are crucial to understand in investigating the co - evolution of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) and their host galaxies since outflows may play an important role as an agn feedback mechanism . based on the archival uv spectra obtained with hst and iue , we investigate outflows in the broad - line region ( blr ) in low - redshift agns ( @xmath0 ) through the detailed analysis of the velocity profile of the c  iv  emission line . </S>",
    "<S> we find a dependence of the outflow strength on the eddington ratio and the blr metallicity in our low - redshift agn sample , which is consistent with the earlier results obtained for high - redshift quasars . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that the blr outflows , gas accretion onto smbh , and past star - formation activity in the host galaxies are physically related in low - redshift agns as in powerful high - redshift quasars . </S>"
