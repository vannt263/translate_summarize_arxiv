    "consider a physical process that induces a relative phase @xmath0 in the state of a system .",
    "for example , one can send light through a medium with an unknown index of refraction @xmath1 to induce a phase shift @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the wavelength of the light and @xmath4 the length of the medium .",
    "this phase shift can be measured relative to a reference beam in a mach - zehnder interferometer .",
    "when we assume that @xmath4 and @xmath3 are known with very high precision , we can infer the index of refraction with an accuracy that is proportional to the error in the phase .",
    "many precision measurements can be reformulated in terms of a phase measurement , with the search for gravitational waves as one of the most urgent cases ( fritschel , 1998 ) .",
    "it is therefore important to have definite bounds on the error in the phase , given a particular set of resources .",
    "we should realize , however , that there are two distinct questions we can ask about the uncertainty in the phase .",
    "first , there is the relative phase difference @xmath5 that renders two quantum states @xmath6 and @xmath7 distinguishable , i.e. , @xmath8 here , we assume that the dependency on @xmath5 actually does render @xmath7 orthogonal to @xmath6 .",
    "we can then minimize @xmath5 to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ dist ] ) .",
    "this depends on the characteristics of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "thus , @xmath5 is a measure of the dynamical rate of the ( unitary ) evolution .",
    "a second question we can ask , is how well one can measure @xmath0 given a state @xmath9 .",
    "that is , we want an expression for the error @xmath10 in the phase .",
    "since there is no phase operator , we usually measure a suitably chosen ( hermitian ) operator @xmath11 such that @xmath12 mathematically , these two problems are very similar , since measuring @xmath9 typically involves interference with some other state @xmath13 . choosing situations where @xmath14 allows us to derive bounds on the fundamental quantum limits of parameter estimation ( @xmath10 ) by calculating the maximum rate of dynamical evolution ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "it was recognized early on by mandelstam and tamm in 1945 that the uncertainty relation between time and energy for a given frequency @xmath15 can be used to prove the following inequality ( mandelstam and tamm , 1945 ) : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the time it takes to evolve from the initial state to the next orthogonal state , @xmath18 is the energy difference between the two orthogonal states and we have used @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath20 is the uncertainty in energy .",
    "this inequality can be interpreted as follows : the minimum phase difference @xmath10 that can be detected is inversely proportional to the normalized energy spread of the state @xmath21 ( with @xmath22 ) .",
    "the normalization is given by @xmath18 .",
    "the factor @xmath23 has a geometric interpretation that is highly relevant for this paper : the minimum distance between two points that can be distinguished by a wave is given by the distance between a crest and the adjacent trough of the wave .",
    "this ( normalized ) distance of @xmath23 is also known as the _ rayleigh limit_.    however , it became clear that the mandelstam - tamm ( mt ) inequality is not applicable to situations involving certain pathological states ( shapiro _ et al_. , 1989 ; braunstein _ et al_. , 1992 ; uffink , 1993 ) .",
    "when coherent ( classical ) states with @xmath24 are used , the mt - inequality yields the poissonian error @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the average number of quanta in the coherent state .",
    "the indication was that phase estimation could not improve beyond the so - called heisenberg limit ( ou , 1996 ) : @xmath27 but there exist states with finite average energy @xmath28 and unbounded @xmath20 . according to the mt - inequality",
    ", such states could have a precision that is proportional to , for example , @xmath29 .",
    "if there are states for which the mt - inequality does not give a saturated bound , then the next question is whether an additional bound can be derived . in 1998 ,",
    "margolus and levitin did just that ( margolus and levitin , 1998 ) .",
    "they showed that @xmath30 which for narrow - band schemes around frequency @xmath15 with @xmath31 yields @xmath32 this inequality therefore restricts the precision in a phase measurement by the _ average energy _",
    ", rather than the energy spread .",
    "the pathological states mentioned above turn out to have sufficiently small average energies so that eq .",
    "( [ ou ] ) is still satisfied .",
    "recent examples of applied phase estimation include frequency measurements ( bollinger , 1996 ) , the quantum gyroscope ( dowling , 1998 ) , quantum positioning and clock synchronization ( giovannetti et al . , 2001 ) , and length and weak force measurements using coherent optical states ( ralph , 2002 ; munro _ et al .",
    "_ , 2002 ) .",
    "suppose we want to estimate a parameter @xmath0 by measuring a particular observable .",
    "construct the state @xmath33 where the basis @xmath34 is chosen in some convenient way determined by the physics of estimating @xmath0 with the choice of observable as @xmath35 .",
    "then the expectation value of @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 .",
    "when we repeat this experiment @xmath38 times , we obtain @xmath39 furthermore , we know that @xmath40 , and the variance of @xmath36 given @xmath38 samples is readily computed to be @xmath41 . according to estimation theory @xmath42 the standard variance in the parameter @xmath0 after @xmath38 trials is thus given by @xmath43 in other words , the uncertainty in the phase is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of trials .",
    "this is the classical poissonian error in the phase .    with the help of quantum entanglement we can achieve the heisenberg limit of @xmath44 .",
    "consider an entangled input state on @xmath38 systems : @xmath45 the relative phase @xmath46 can be obtained by a unitary evolution @xmath47 and @xmath48 , thus yielding the required factor .",
    "when we suggestively write @xmath49 and @xmath50 , then the state becomes @xmath51 this is mathematically equivalent to a single ( nonlocal ! ) system with a relative phase shift of @xmath52 . in order to measure this phase",
    ", we need to measure the ( nonlocal ) observable @xmath53 : @xmath54 this yields @xmath55 as before , we obtain @xmath56 here we see that the precision in @xmath0 is increased by a factor @xmath57 over the standard noise limit when we exploit quantum entanglement .    when the loss of subsystems is considered ( for example , when @xmath58 out of @xmath38 photons fail to arrive ) , the entangled state in eq.([entstate ] ) becomes separable and mixed : @xmath59 not only is it separable , there is also no information about @xmath0 in this state .",
    "this state can therefore not be used for the parameter estimation at all .    one way to circumvent this practical difficulty is to use separable states and non - local observables . when @xmath60 out of @xmath38 systems arrive , the experimenter chooses to measure @xmath61 instead of @xmath53 .",
    "this way , the parameter @xmath0 is estimated with an enhanced precision proportional to @xmath62 .",
    "the price to pay is that often the measurement of @xmath61 will fail because it does not span the complete state space .",
    "it must also be noted that this trick depends on the physical implementation , and can not always be applied .",
    "one particular physical implementation of this process involves light , and this will lead us to the main topic of this paper .",
    "suppose that the state in eq .",
    "( [ inst ] ) is physically implemented by a so - called two - mode _ noon state _ ( kok _ et al_. , 2002 ) : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is an @xmath65-photon state .",
    "when we choose @xmath53 to be @xmath66 then the uncertainty in the phase is again given by @xmath67 .",
    "however , there is also something else going on ",
    "when we calculate the expectation value of @xmath53 , we find that it varies as @xmath68 .",
    "that is , the geometric distance between the two points that can be distinguished according to the rayleigh limit is now _",
    "@xmath38 times smaller than in the classical case ! _ as a consequence , we can in principle read and write much smaller features with this technique .",
    "this is called quantum lithography ( boto _ et al_. , 2000 ) , and we will now give a full description of this phenomenon in terms of the quantum interference of two optical modes .",
    "suppose two plane waves characterised by @xmath69 and @xmath70 hit a surface at an angle @xmath71 from the normal vector .",
    "the wave vectors are given by @xmath72 where we assume @xmath73 .",
    "the wave number @xmath65 is related to the wavelength of the light according to @xmath74 .    in order to find the interference pattern in the intensity @xmath75 , we sum the two plane waves at position @xmath76 at the amplitude level : @xmath77\\ ; .\\ ] ] when we calculate the inner product @xmath78 from eq .",
    "( [ planewave ] ) we obtain the expression @xmath79 for the intensity along the substrate in direction @xmath80 .    as we saw above",
    ", the rayleigh limit is given by the minimal resolvable feature size @xmath81 that corresponds to the distance between an intensity maximum and an adjacent minimum . from eq .",
    "( [ cos2 ] ) we obtain @xmath82 this means that the maximum resolution is given by @xmath83 the maximum resolution is therefore proportional to the wavelength and inversely proportional to the sine of the angle between the incoming plane waves and the normal .",
    "the resolution is thus maximal ( @xmath84 is minimal ) when @xmath85 , or @xmath86 .",
    "this is the limit of grazing incidence .",
    "the classical diffraction limit is therefore @xmath87 .",
    "note that this derivation does not use the approximation @xmath88 , which is common when considering diffraction phenomena .",
    "so how does quantum lithography work ? in the limit of grazing incidence , we let the two counter - propagating light beams @xmath89 and @xmath90 be in the combined entangled state of @xmath38 photons @xmath91 where @xmath92 , with @xmath74 .",
    "we define the mode operator @xmath93 and its adjoint @xmath94 .",
    "the deposition rate @xmath95 on the substrate is then given by ( boto _ et al_. , 2002 ) : @xmath96 i.e. , we look at the higher - order moments of the electric field operator on the substrate .",
    "the deposition rate @xmath95 scales with the @xmath97 power of intensity . leaving the substrate exposed for a time @xmath17 to the light source will result in an exposure pattern @xmath98 . after a straightforward calculation",
    "we see that @xmath99 we interpret this as follows .",
    "a path - differential phase - shift @xmath0 in light beam @xmath90 results in a displacement @xmath80 of the interference pattern on the substrate . using two classical waves , a phase - shift of @xmath100 will return the pattern to its original position .",
    "however , according to eq .",
    "( [ deprate ] ) , one cycle is completed after a shift of @xmath101 .",
    "this means that a shift of @xmath100 will displace the pattern @xmath38 times . in other words",
    ", we have @xmath38 times as many maxima in the interference pattern",
    ". these will be closely spaced , yielding an effective rayleigh resolution of @xmath102 , a factor of @xmath38 below the classical interferometric result of @xmath103 .",
    "we have also shown that quantum lithography can be used to create arbitrary patterns in one dimension , rather than just closely spaced lines ( kok _ et al_. , 2001 ) .",
    "this can be achieved by using superpositions of the more complicated state @xmath104 there are two fundamentally different ways states of the form in eq .",
    "( [ nm ] ) can be superposed .",
    "we can either sum over the photon number @xmath38 : @xmath105 with @xmath106 complex coefficients , or we can sum over the photon distribution @xmath107 : @xmath108 where @xmath109 denotes the largest integer @xmath110 with @xmath111 and @xmath112 again the complex coefficients .",
    "every branch in this superposition is an @xmath38-photon state .",
    "these techniques not only allow us to create arbitrary one - dimensional patterns , but extensions to four - mode states also facilitate two - dimensional patterns ( kok _ et al_. , 2001 ) . furthermore , by choosing the @xmath112 coefficients of eq .",
    "( [ bjork ] ) in a special way , bjrk _",
    "et al_.  showed that one can construct a subwavelength resolution pixel state .",
    "this state can subsequently be used to illuminate a surface in order to etch an arbitrary pattern ( bjrk _ et al_. , 2001 ) .",
    "the principle of quantum lithography has been demonstrated using two - photon path - entangled states generated by parametric down - conversion ( dangelo et al . , 2001 ) . in this experiment ,",
    "the photon pairs are created in a bbo crystal ( @xmath113-@xmath114 ) . immediately behind the crystal ,",
    "a double - slit aperture is placed , which blocks most pairs . however , when two photons do get through , they are extremely likely to have passed through the same slit .    this way , the state of the light field just after the slits is approximately @xmath115 , where @xmath116 and @xmath117 denote the two slits .",
    "this state is of the form of eq .",
    "( [ n00n ] ) , and can therefore be used to beat the rayleigh limit . by scanning the output field with a set of two detectors ,",
    "the diffraction pattern conditioned on a two - fold detector coincidence was mapped out .",
    "this pattern was twice as narrow as the single - photon diffraction pattern , and the principle of sub - rayleigh resolution due to two - photon quantum lithography was thereby demonstrated .",
    "subsequent experiments with photon pairs have confirmed these findings ( edamatsu _ et al_. , 2002 ; shimizu _ et al_. , 2002 ) .    however , in order for quantum lithography to work , we also need a suitable photo - resist . in other words , we need a material that is sensitive to multi - photon events in order to etch images on its surface .",
    "last year , korobkin and yablonovich exposed commercial photographic film to photon pairs , and produced the coveted two - fold resolution enhancement ( korobkin and yablonovitch , 2002 ) .",
    "since this experiment includes both the state preparation and the imaging process , it qualifies as the first _ complete _ demonstration of quantum lithography .    shortly after the experiment of dangelo _ et al_. , cataliotti _",
    "et al_. , performed frequency measurements using multiphoton raman transitions in rubidium atoms that are confined in an optical dipole trap ( cataliotti _ et al_. , 2001 ) .",
    "the multiphoton events of up to fifty photons resulted in a spectral width that is below the fourier limit .",
    "although not exactly quantum lithography , this experiment strongly suggests that the _ quantum rayleigh limit _ of @xmath118 is correct .",
    "another essential ingredient for quantum lithography is the generation of the required quantum states of the light field .",
    "the states in eqs .",
    "( [ nm ] ) and ( [ n ] ) are very complicated , and it is not quite clear how they can be generated efficiently without large kerr nonlinearities ( gerry and campos , 2001 ) .",
    "the production of @xmath38-photon entangled states conditioned on _",
    "non_-detection was proposed ( fiurek , 2002 ) , as well as the creation of noon - states based on single - photon detection ( lee _ et al_. , 2002 ; kok _ et al_. , 2002 ; gerry _ et al_. , 2002 ) .",
    "we have shown that quantum lithography and heisenberg - limited parameter estimation are two manifestations of the same principle : instead of many separate measurements of @xmath0 that lead to the shot - noise limit ( in , for example , an experiment using @xmath38 trials with the single - photon path - entangled state @xmath119 ) , entangling the resources of these @xmath38 measurements to conduct a single - shot experiment ( e.g. , using the @xmath38-photon noon - state latexmath:[$|n,0\\rangle +    instead of rayleigh limited single - photon diffraction patterns , we can use @xmath38-photon entangled states to increase the resolution by a factor @xmath38 .",
    "mathematically , the hyperresolution of quantum lithography appears naturally in the derivation of heisenberg - limited parameter estimation .",
