    "nowadays , lattice techniques have become an important method for the study of non - perturbative quantum field theory .",
    "it is widely used for calculations of hadron spectrum and for understanding the structure of nonperturbative effects in quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "however , there is a serious problem to avoid the fermion doubling and to implement the axial anomaly into the lattice field theory . the most popular way to resolve the problem",
    "was suggested by wilson @xcite and in ref.@xcite it was shown , that in the continuum limit , the lattice theory with wilson fermions reproduces axial anomaly .",
    "the wilson action contains a term which breaks chiral invariance by mass - like term , with a mass parameter of the order of inverse size of a lattice size and , due to interactions , this term is renormalized and fine tuning is then required . the kogut - susskind action @xcite reduces the number of fermions but does not reproduce the axial anomaly .",
    "also , there are attempts to resolve the problem by a gauge - violating majorana - type wilson mass @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a considerable theoretical activity on the use of surface states as a basis for a theory of chiral lattice fermions @xcite where our four dimensional world is considered as an interface in a five dimensional underlying space @xcite . under some conditions ,",
    "low energy fermionic states are bound to this wall . for this low energy states , we have an effective chiral theory on the interface .",
    "a hamiltonian approach for this formulation of the chiral theory was considered in ref.@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study nonlocal gauge invariant action for massless fermions without fermion doubling .",
    "let us consider a general one - dimensional lattice action for a free massless fermion field : s=_n , m|_m a_m , n_n [ 1 ] where a_m , n =- a_n , m = a_m - n a(0)=0 [ 2 ]    in this paper , we consider the case of antiperiodic boundary conditions , which are imposed on the fermion field for convenience only .",
    "the case of periodical boundary conditions could be considered as well ; nothing would be changed except minor technical details .",
    "let us consider the lattice with even numbers of elements , -nnn-1 , [ 2a ] we conveniently rewrite the action ( [ 1 ] ) in the following form s=_n , m|_m+12 a_m - n_n+12 [ 3 ] where @xmath1 is the size of the lattice .    to diagonalize the action ( [ 1 ] )",
    ", we use fourier transformation : _ m+12=_k =- n^n-1e^i_k+12 +    has the form : s=12n_m , n , k ,",

    "n^n-1|_k+12 e^-ia(n)_k+12 + & = & -i_k =- n^n-1|_k+12 ( 2_n=0^n-1a(n ) ( ) )",
    "_ k+12 + & = & _ k =- n^n+1|_k+12 b(k+12)_k+12 [ 6 ] where b(k)=-i2_n=0^n-1a(n ) ( ) .",

    "k+12= , [ 8 ] where @xmath4 is the lattice spacing and @xmath5 is the fermion momentum",
    ". then the action has the well known form : s=_k |_k+12_k+12 [ 9 ] and for @xmath6 , in the limit @xmath7 , we obtain an additional pole in the fermion propagator .    now , let us consider @xmath8 for @xmath9 in the general nonlocal case : b(n-12)&=&2_n=0^n-1a(n ) ( ) + & = & 2_n=0^n-1a(n)(n- ) + & = & 2_n=0^n-1a(n)(-1)^n+1 ( ) [ 10 ] it is clear , that if we choose that as @xmath10 a(n)~n , [ 11 ] the second pole in the fermion propagator will be absent in the continuum limit .",
    "it is convenient to choose @xmath11 in the following form a(m - n)=_=-n^n-1<e_m+12e_+12 > _ + 12<e_-(+12)e_n+12 > [ 12 ] where we use the following notations : e_+12(x)=e^i_(+12 ) x + e_m+12(x)=(x - ma ) ( ( m+1)a - x ) + < f>=_-l/2^l/2f(x)dx [ 13 ] then , in the limit @xmath7 , we obtain : a(n)&=&i1a_0^a(xn ) [ 14 ] + b(k+12)&=&_k+12 ( ) [ 15 ] from eq.([15 ] ) , we see that the second pole of the fermion propagator is absent .",
    "notice , that asymptotically @xmath11 in eq.([14 ] ) has the form ( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "also , one may use the simplest choice for @xmath12 : a(n)= n0 [ 16 ] in this case , the second pole in the propagator of a free fermion will be absent in the continuum limit as well .",
    "the case @xmath13 was considered in @xcite .",
    "thus , we have constructed the action for a free massless fermion field with a single fermion .",
    "still there is a question : does the theory have a correct limit at @xmath7 in the presence of gauge fields .    to study this question ,",
    "let us consider the lattice fermion in the presence of an external gauge field .",
    "in the case of @xmath14 , @xmath15 gauge theory with one fermion , the action has the following form : s=_m , n",
    "=- n^n-1|_m+12 v^(m+12 ) ( n+12)a(m - n)_n+12 , [ 17 ] where we introduce the following matrices on the links of the lattice : u^m+12=p ( ig_x=(m-12)a^x=(m+12)a(x)dx ) [ 18 ] and v^(m+12)(n+12)&=&u^m+1/2u^m-3/2 ... u^n+1/2 + for 0 < |m - n|_mod(2n )",

    "it is known , that we can gauge away contributions of nonconstant components of the gauge field @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "but in general case , it is not possible to remove a constant gauge field because there are gauge transformations which violate the boundary conditions : -1g_x(x ) + ( x)=gx + _",
    "n+1/2e^i(x = a(n+1/2))_n+1/2 [ 21 ] and keeps antiperiodic boundary conditions only when ( x)=(2/l)nx , n=1,2 , ... [ 22 ] the presence of the constant gauge field corresponds to the shift of momentum in eq.([7 ] ) : b(k+1/2)b(k+1/2+y/2 ) [ 23 ] where @xmath20 .    notice that the highest fermionic modes ( @xmath21 ) have a strong dependence on the gauge field",
    "it means that the contributions of the high frequency modes in physical observables ( which feel the lattice structure ) will not die in the limit @xmath7 .",
    "let us check this statement in the simplest case of the 2-dimensional schwinger model with one dirac fermion . in the case of continuous imaginary time and a lattice in space , the action has the following form : s = dx_m , n =- n^n-1(|_m+1/2(x)id_x_1^mn _ n+1/2(x ) . + .+|_m+1/2(x ) v^(m+12)_2 ( n+12)a(m - n)_n+1/2(x ) .",
    "[ 24 ] where @xmath22 is the covariant derivative : id_x_n+1/2(x)=(i_x - ga^n+1/2_x(x))_n+1/2(x ) [ 25 ] it is easy to calculate the effective action for a constant gauge field @xmath17 . according to the continuous theory , the potential has the following form : w(y)-w(0)=n_f(|y|^2_mod(2 ) ) [ 26 ] where @xmath23 if @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the number of dirac fermions . in the case of the lattice theory",
    "we have : w(y)-w(0)=-_-^d_k =- n^n-1 ln ( ) + = -12l^2_k =- n^n-1(|b(k+1/2+y/2)|- b(k+1/2)| ) [ 27 ] we considered the cases of standard ( [ 8 ] ) and nonlocal ( [ 16 ] ) fermion actions .",
    "the results obtained for @xmath27 are shown in fig.1 , where solid lines corresponds to the standard lattice action with one dirac fermion and to eq.([26 ] ) for @xmath28 ( two curves practically coincide with each other ) , and the dashed line corresponds to the case of the nonlocal lattice action for one dirac fermion field .",
    "comparing our results with eq.([26 ] ) , we see that the standard fermionic action corresponds to the case of two dirac fermions in the continuum limit . at the same time",
    "we see that the lattice with nonlocal action for fermions has a strong dependence on the lattice size and does not tend to any continuous theory with a finite number of fermions .",
    "thus , we see that the lattice effects do not disappear in the case of nonlocal action .",
    "it is possible , of course , to discuss a possibility to kill this strong dependence by choosing a special form for @xmath29 , but in this case we need to make a fine tuning and it is not clear , whether these lattice artifacts disappear in the other physical values in the limit of @xmath7 .",
    "thus , we have to conclude that the attempt to resolve the fermion doubling problem by means of nonlocal action in the case of gauge theory has serious difficulties to obtain a correct continuum limit .",
    "in this paper , we considered nonlocal fermion action to solve the problem of the fermion doubling .",
    "it was found that it is possible to construct a nonlocal lattice action for free fermions without doubling , but the theory has no correct continuum limit in the presence of a gauge field .",
    "this problem appears because of the strong couplings of high frequency modes which feel lattice structure .",
