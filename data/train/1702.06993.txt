    "a particular focus is on calling risk , i.e.  the risk of unplanned withdrawals such as , for instance , early redemptions of shares in a mutual fund . in that context , @xcite established the notions of expected and dynamic liquidity - at - risk ( elar and dylar ) as similar concepts to the value - at - risk ( var ) , modeling the extremes of the expected cash liquidity as quantiles of the underlying distributions .    over the past few years , professional management of redemption risks has become an important regulatory requirement , both in the european union and in the united states ; see the corresponding guidelines @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors propose a static model to quantify these redemption risks specific to mutual funds via the _ liquidity at risk ( lar ) _ , which they adapted from the measurement of daily net cahsflows specific to the banking sector ( compare @xcite ) , and which complies with regulatory guidelines .",
    "the liquidity at risk is based on the well - known peaks - over - threshold approach from extreme value theory ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , providing a liquidity reserve that is not exceeded with a certain probability .",

    "this approach has successfully been pursued in many different domains , compare , e.g. , @xcite , and can be summarized as follows : first , one identifies reproducible , pertinent features of observed realizations .",
    "second , one designs parsimonious statistical models that are able to reproduce these features in a natural way .",
    "concerning potential parametrizations of our models , we follow occam s razor ( or the parsimony principle of statistics ) and head for statistical models with low - dimensional and easily interpreted parametrizations . we are thus lead to consider a markov process , the autoregressive generalized pareto ( argp ) process , which naturally generalizes the pareto processes introduced by @xcite . to add flexibility in the modeling of increasing sequences of exceedances",

    "@xcite introduces _ data features _ as a fundamental notion for statistical modeling .",
    "formally , data features can be regarded as functionals from the underlying distributions to some feature space . since in applications",
    "one wishes to infer these features from historical data , the domains of these data feature functionals should contain the observed empirical distributions and , with a view towards inference , should ensure that the empirical distribution is close to the model distribution , i.e.  the data feature functional should be weakly continuous . as a basis for the models proposed in section  [ sectargpprocesses ] , in this section we identify several key data features in typical time series of fund redemptions .",

    "we note that the data is characterized by different regimes of fund redemptions ; regimes of low or moderate redemption cashflows are followed by regimes of extraordinarily high redemptions . in the second regime ,",
    "the data in fact exceeds very high thresholds , and it appears that the distribution of exceedances is invariant when the threshold is increased .",
    "we take this invariance property as the first data feature , and we subsequently refer to it as .",

    "third , upon investigating exceedances more closely , it becomes apparent that we can distinguish two subregimes ( see figure  [ fig : df ] ) , and that otherwise exceedances look strikingly similar .",
    "the fact that the process appears to switch randomly between these two subregimes is taken as data feature .",
    "as exemplified by figure  [ fig : df ] , the subregimes are characterized either by ( a ) a deterministic build - up over time ( data feature ) , followed by a sudden and sharp decrease ( data feature ) ; or ( b ) an isolated , single shock ( data feature ) .",
    "the behavior in subregime  ( a ) is reminiscent of a shot - noise process run backward in time ; we return to this link in section  [ sectargpprocess ] below .",
    "an additional feature of the fund redemptions process is the fact that it can attain zero , reflecting business days without redemption cashflows .",
    "we note this as data feature .",

    "in particular , targp processes are capable of capturing the two different regimes of fund redemptions as described by in section  [ datafeatures ] .",

    "for that purpose , we determine the interarrival times of the real data , @xmath289 and compare them with the interarrival times @xmath290 of a simluated realization of the targp process with the same length as the market data time series .",
    "figure  [ fig : wt_box ] shows the results .",
    "the fits of interarrival times are not fully convincing , at least if one aims for a good fit over the whole range of interarrival times .",
    "the fact that our model  as do most models derived from extreme value asymptotics  generates ( almost ) memoryless distributions for interarrival times ( see proposition  [ prop : arrival ] ) is not easily reconciled with the interarrivals seen in the data .",
    "an acceptable fit is achieved up to approximately the third quartile , whereas in the tails but in the tails one observes much longer interarrival times in reality than produced with our model . from a risk modeling perspective , however , it is much more important to adequately capture the behavior of higher frequencies ; in this dimension , the targp model performs very well .    upon a closer inspection of the redemption time series ( compare figure  [ fig : example ] ) , we can identify a transient initial phase of the fund , where investors start buying shares in the fund and redemptions are scarce .",
    "this phenomenon is quite well - known in professional fund management , and thus risk management typically and justifiably focuses on the post - burn - in phase .",
    "hence , the actual goal in the modeling of interarrival times is to fit interarrivals after the burn - in phase . to examine this and to identify the initial phase",
    ", we also calculate the interarrival times @xmath291 and @xmath292 based on time series starting after certain offsets .",
    "thus our calulcations are based on the series @xmath287 and @xmath286 for @xmath293\\,,\\,[252,n]\\,,\\,[504,n]\\,,\\,[756,n]\\,,\\,[1008,n]\\,,\\,[1260,n]$ ] , where @xmath294 denotes the total length of the original time series . here",
    "the offsets of @xmath295 trading days represent a time scale from @xmath190 to @xmath296 years .",
    "the results are illustrated in figure  [ fig : wt_compare ] .",
    "first , they indicate that indeed the statistics stabilize beyond a certain offset ( @xmath297 years in the displayed example ) .",
    "second , we see that the waiting times of the simulated process are quite stable over time . when the burn - in phase is cut off , the targp model achieves a remarkably good fit over the entire range of interarrival times .",
    "thus , with the exception of funds that are still in their non - stationary initial phase , the targp model appears to be a suitable model for interarrival times in our application domain  at least after a burn - in phase , and there is some evidence that the high frequencies of long waiting times seen in the data in figure[fig : wt_box ] could be pre - asymptotic behavior .",
    "this article has proposed a flexible class of time series models that can be used to model dynamic phenomena that feature extreme - value distributions .",
    "we have also provided estimators for the underlying parameters , and we have illustrated our model in the context of fund liquidity management .",
