    "also one can achieve the random potential by loading a mixture of two kinds of atoms in a optical lattice with one heavy and one light , and the effect of the heavy ones is to produce an effective random potential for the lighter atoms when the heavy ones localize in the lattice randomly @xcite . another way to produce",
