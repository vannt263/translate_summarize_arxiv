    "they have also shown there that the new mechanism constitutes a big fraction of the cross section for @xmath20 meson production and a good description of the inclusive @xmath20 meson production at the lhc was achieved .    in the present paper",
    "we wish to investigate how important is the gluon fragmentation mechanism for the double @xmath20-meson production , i.e. double fragmentation of each of the gluons in the gluon dijets in sps production and double fragmentation of each of the gluons in the gluon jet in dps production mechanism . here",
    "the gluon and digluon production is considered in the @xmath17-factorization approach with reggeized gluons in the t - channel @xcite via subprocesses @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the reggeized gluon . in our analysis",

    "the two produced gluons are correlated in azimuth , the mechanism will naturally lead to an azimuthal correlation between the @xmath29 ( or @xmath30 ) mesons .",

    "the spin polarization of the two partons from one hadron can be mutually correlated , especially when the partons are relatively close in phase space ( having comparable @xmath45 s ) .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the standard single pdfs , the two - parton distributions have a nontrivial color structure which also may lead to a non - negligible correlations effects .",
    "such effects are usually not included in phenomenological analyses .",
    "they were exceptionally discussed in the context of double charm production @xcite .",
    "however , the effect on e.g. azimuthal correlations between charmed quarks was found there to be very small , much smaller than effects of the sps contribution associated with double gluon fragmentation discussed in the present paper .",
    "in addition , including perturbative parton splitting mechanism also leads to a breaking of the pocket - formula @xcite .",
    "this formalism was so far formulated for the collinear leading - order approach which for charm ( double charm ) may be a bit academic as this leads to underestimation of the cross section . imposing sum rules also leads to a breaking of the factorized ansatz but the effect almost vanishes for small longitudinal momentum fractions @xcite .",
    "taken the above we will use the pocket - formula in the following .    in the @xmath17-factorization approach ,",
    "the cross section for sps cross sections can be presented as follows : @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48    here the four - momenta of the initial - state gluons are parameterized as a sum of longitudinal and transverse parts @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 are the four - momenta of the protons , @xmath53 , @xmath54 are the partonic cross sections with reggeized gluons in the initial state .",

    "<S> we discuss production of @xmath0 ( and @xmath1 ) pairs related to the lhcb collaboration results for @xmath2 = 7 tev in proton - proton scattering . </S>",
    "<S> we consider double - parton scattering ( dps ) mechanisms of double @xmath3 production and subsequent @xmath4 hadronization as well as double @xmath5 and mixed @xmath6 production with @xmath7 and @xmath8 hadronization calculated with the help of the scale - dependent hadronization functions of kniehl et al . </S>",
    "<S> single - parton scattering ( sps ) mechanism of digluon production is also taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results with several correlation observables in azimuthal angle @xmath9 between @xmath10 mesons or in dimeson invariant mass @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of new mechanisms with @xmath12 fragmentation leads to larger cross sections , than when including only dps mechanism @xmath4 with standard scale - independent fragmentation functions . </S>",
    "<S> some consequences of the presence of the new mechanisms are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> in particular a larger @xmath13 is needed to describe the lhcb data . </S>",
    "<S> there is a signature that @xmath13 may depend on transverse momentum of @xmath14 quarks and/or @xmath15 antiquarks . </S>"
