    "in their first formulation of quantum mechanics , both schrdinger and dirac were strongly influenced by connections to the hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics .",
    "indeed , in one of the very first applications of schrdinger s time - dependent equation ( tdse ) , dirac @xcite indicated a close parallel between the coupled first - order set of equations arising from the tdse and the coupled first - order hamilton equations of classical mechanics .",
    "dirac introduced the time - dependent basis set expansion , @xmath1 where the @xmath2 are complex co - efficients and @xmath3 denotes an arbitrary basis . in the tdse ( where , for the moment , we put @xmath4 ) this expansion leads to the set of first - order coupled equations , @xmath5 where @xmath6 are the matrix elements of the quantum hamiltonian .",
    "dirac then remarked that by considering the co - efficients @xmath7 and @xmath8 to be canonical variables and assuming a hamiltonian function @xmath9 the quantum equations are equivalent to the classical hamilton equations @xmath10 note , however , that this is still fully quantum mechanical since the matrix elements and the amplitudes appearing in the classical hamiltonian are all complex objects .",
    "hence , there is no obvious classical counterpart .",
    "dirac also made a transformation to real variables by using amplitude and phase of the quantum co - efficients , i.e.@xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "although with this transformation the variables are real , the classical hamiltonian still contains complex quantities and hence does not obviously correspond to any real physical system .",
    "forty years later , strocchi @xcite approached the question of quantum / classical equivalence slightly differently .",
    "he first formulated classical mechanics in terms of complex variables @xmath13 , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 real , to give the hamiltonian equations ( [ eq : hameqns ] ) in the form , @xmath16 and its complex conjugate . here",
    "@xmath17 _ is _ a real classical hamiltonian .",
    "then it is remarked that the tdse coupled equations ( [ eq : schreqns ] ) are equivalent to these classical equations i.e. @xmath18 if the classical hamiltonian function is taken as the expectation value of the quantum hamiltonian i.e. @xmath19 as in the treatment of dirac .",
    "although ostensibly time - dependent and complex , it is easy to prove that @xmath17 becomes constant and real for hermitian hamiltonians . identifying @xmath2 with @xmath20 and reverting to the real variables @xmath21 one has however , still the apparently complex form quoted by strocchi @xcite , @xmath22 of course , for @xmath23 hermitian one does achieve a real classical hamiltonian @xmath24\\ ] ] and in the special case that all coupling matrix elements are real the hamiltonian @xmath25 which is that of coupled real harmonic oscillators .",
    "note that the coupling is of a very special form in which there is both linear position and momentum off - diagonal coupling with exactly the same coupling strengths .",
    "the mapping of the tdse onto classical - like equations up until now has been regarded as something of a curiosity , although it has been used as a starting point to treat some problems of molecular electronic dynamics semi - classically @xcite .",
    "here we show that systems of coupled classical oscillators corresponding to the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : classham ] ) can be realised whose position and momentum variables reproduce _ exactly _ the time - dependent coefficients of an expansion of the quantum wavefunction .",
    "we call these the p&q - coupled oscillators .",
    "each oscillator plays the role of a state in hilbert space and the coupling between the oscillators the role of quantum coupling matrix elements .",
    "unfortunately , for a general quantum system the corresponding exactly equivalent classical system involves rather complicated coupling schemes between the oscillators .",
    "however , we show that in a weak - coupling approximation , simpler sets of coupled oscillators in which only the q - coupling in the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : classham ] ) occurs provide an exceedingly good approximation to the exact result .    in previous papers @xcite , where we studied energy transfer along dipole - dipole interacting molecules , we called this approximation the realistic - coupling approximation ( rca ) since for this case , either classical or quantum , to be realistic it is essential that the oscillators and quantum entities largely retain their character when coupled i.e.  the coupling is weak compared to their internal forces .",
    "although in this work we consider a general hamiltonian where the diagonal elements in a chosen basis are not necessarily associated with concrete physical entities and thus there is no _ a priori _ reason for the off - diagonal elements to be small , we will still keep the term rca for this weak coupling approximation .",
    "it is interesting that , with reference to specific systems , several authors have already recognised the similarity between q - coupled classical oscillators and few - level quantum systems . indeed , already in one of the the first quantum treatments of resonant electronic energy transfer between identical atoms , frenkel in 1930 @xcite remarked on the essential equivalence of the quantum treatment to the earlier 1925 classical treatment of holtsmark @xcite .",
    "in particular he showed that the normal mode frequencies of the classical coupled equations reduce to the quantum eigenvalues in the approximation that we call the rca .    in 1977",
    "mckibben @xcite constructed a system of three coupled mechanical pendula and showed that , in a weak - coupling approximation similar to our rca , their equations of motion become equivalent to the quantum equations describing the operation of a spin filter on three levels of the hydrogen atom .",
    "later hemmer and prentiss @xcite used the same 3-pendulum classical system to interpret the quite different 3-level atomic problem of the stimulated resonance raman effect and pointed out `` the strong mathematical similarities between the pendulum amplitude equations and the resonance raman equations '' .",
    "more recently , marx and glaser @xcite have derived an exact correspondence ( in the rca ) between the dynamics of three isotropically coupled spins and those of three coupled classical oscillators . here",
    "the liouville equation for the density matrix and spin correlation functions derived from it were considered .    in a rather different application ,",
    "jolk et  al .",
    "@xcite and kovaleva et  al .",
    "@xcite have pointed out the similarity of the non - crossing behaviour of the eigenfrequencies of a pair of dissimilar classical oscillators under varying coupling to the non - crossing behaviour of the eigenenergies of two quantum levels subject to a varying perturbation , as in the celebrated landau - zener problem .",
    "similarly spreeuw  et  al .",
    "@xcite has discussed a classical optical system as analogue to a driven two - level atom .",
    "in previous communications @xcite we have shown that the time - dependent schrdinger equation for an aggregate of @xmath0 coupled monomers having a single electronic transition and the classical equations for coupled electric dipoles are equivalent in the rca .",
    "there we demonstrated that the quantum coherence in the transfer of electronic excitation along a linear chain of monomers is reproduced by the transfer of electric dipole strength along the equivalent classical array .",
    "the equivalence proof was restricted to this special problem of coupled classical electric dipoles and its relevance for energy transfer in photosynthesis .",
    "these many and varied applications point to a general property of equivalence of classical oscillators and quantum systems in finite hilbert spaces .",
    "however , none of the above authors discuss their findings in the context of dirac and strocchi s analysis .",
    "also they all use classical oscillators that are q - coupled , i.e. they work only in the rca and do not recognise that it is possible to construct classical oscillators that _ exactly _ mimic the quantum system . in the present paper",
    "we show how to construct such p&q - coupled oscillators and then clarify under what conditions the rca allows simpler q - coupled sets of oscillators to be used as analogues of coupled - state quantum systems .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec.2.1",
    "we derive the classical p&q - coupled equations whose variables give directly the coefficients of the time - dependent schrdinger wavefunction .",
    "we also examine the derivation of the rca and the meaning of this approximation in the context of the dirac and strocchi mapping of the schrdinger equation to hamilton s equations . as specific example , in section 3 we consider excitation transfer on a quantum aggregate of @xmath0 coupled monomers and its classical equivalent of @xmath0 coupled pendula .",
    "special attention is given to the @xmath26 dimer case whose wavefunction is considered a fundamental example of quantum entanglement . in this case",
    "the quantum ( and therefore also the p&q - coupled classical ) solution can be obtained in simple closed from",
    ". then the rca is tested by comparing the q - coupled classical solution with the p&q - coupled solution i.e.  with the _ exact _ quantum solution .",
    "oscillatory energy transfer on the dimer is shown to correspond classically to the well - known `` beating '' phenomenon of coupled pendula from whose motion the entangled wavefunction can be extracted .",
    "the classical analysis is given , as example , for the specific case of coupled undamped vertical pendula .",
    "however it is clear that the analysis also applies to other sets of oscillators , particularly classical electrical lc circuits , as shown in appendix [ elec_osci ] .",
    "it is also demonstrated in appendix [ damping ] that the inclusion of a velocity - dependent damping term in the classical equations corresponds exactly to the inclusion of damping via a complex eigenvalue in the quantum equations , as used for example in ref .",
    "first we will show that the first - order schrdinger equations ( [ eq : schreqns ] ) map simply onto the classical hamilton equations for a set of coupled classical oscillators .",
    "since the classical problem of coupled oscillators is almost always formulated using the newton equations rather than the hamilton equations we also present the corresponding second - order newton equations .",
    "we start with the strocchi classical hamiltonian , eq.([eq : classham ] ) . the hamilton equations ( [ eq : hameqns ] ) give @xmath27 symbolically , writing @xmath28 and @xmath29 as vectors and @xmath23 as a matrix the above equations are @xmath30 and formally @xmath31 which are a set of coupled oscillator equations and can be solved for @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the momenta at time @xmath34 can then be calculated from @xmath35 the set of complex amplitudes , the vector @xmath36 , is constructed as @xmath37 from the hamilton eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hameq ] ) we have @xmath38 similarly the schrdinger equation ( [ eq : schreqns ] ) is written @xmath39 or @xmath40 which is exactly the classical equation ( [ eq : zclass ] ) . hence the p&q - coupled classical equations and the coupled quantum schrdinger equations are identical and in particular they have the same eigenvalues .",
    "to see how to construct a set of real classical oscillators , now we write the formal solution in terms of the individual oscillator amplitudes .",
    "first we split off the diagonal term in the hamiltonian .",
    "this quantum energy @xmath41 ( divided by @xmath42 ) will be denoted by @xmath43 .",
    "the off - diagonal elements ( divided by @xmath42 ) will be denoted by @xmath44 .",

    "although the coupling elements appear quite complicated , for a given set of quantum matrix elements @xmath52 they can , in principle , be solved to obtain @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
