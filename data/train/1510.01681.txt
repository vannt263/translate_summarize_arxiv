    "fractional calculus has greatly developed during the last years and has established itself as a generalization of classical differential and integral calculus . over the last three decades the investigation on this subject has intensified and applications were found in many fields of science such as physics , mathematics , chemistry , financial systems , economy and engineering @xcite . as examples we may mention the following applications : the fractional control of engineering systems ; variational calculus and optimum control for fractional dynamic systems ; numerical and analytical tools and techniques ; fundamental explorations of mechanical , electric and thermal constitutive relations ; investigation of properties of several engineering materials such as viscoelastic polymers , foams , gels and animal tissues ; diffusion phenomena ; bioengineering and biomedical applications ; thermal modeling for engineering systems such as breaks and tool - machines and , finally , imaging and signal processing @xcite .    the mathematical investigation of relaxation processes in dielectrics has been conducted with the use of fractional calculus tools @xcite .",
    "the properties of dielectric materials are usually represented by the empirical susceptibility functions as they have been initially modeled by debye ( d ) in 1929 , then by the cole brothers ( c - c ) and , later , in the works of cole - davidson ( c - d ) and havriliak - negami ( h - n ) .",
    "+ with the help of the concept of memory developed in the formalism of mori - zwanzig , it is possible to deduce the kinetic equations for the relaxation processes described by those empirical functions @xcite .",
    "the equations obtained are expressed in terms of the fractional derivative of riemann - liouville and their solutions are given in terms of mittag - leffler functions @xcite .",
    "the mittag - leffler functions of a real variable @xmath3 , with one , two and three parameters , are convenient to study anomalous processes such as those occurring in dielectrics , including the aforementioned classical cases c - c , c - d and h - n .",
    "it is crucial to emphasize that these functions are completely monotonic for @xmath4 @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study fractional kinetic equations with a derivative of order @xmath0 , @xmath5 , proposed as generalizations of the classic kinetic equations associated with relaxation processes in dielectrics , in such a way that the traditional kinetic equations become particular cases of the fractional equations when @xmath2 .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in the first section a brief theoretical introduction is presented of the four empirical expressions of complex susceptibility ( in the frequency domain ) related to debye s model and to the anomalous relaxation processes c - c , c - d e h - n . on the basis of these expressions of complex dielectric permittivity , we present in the second section the construction of the kinetic equations for the debye and the anomalous relaxation functions .",
    "the construction of these kinetic equations is carried with the introduction of an integral memory function . at the end of the second section",
    "the equations are solved and the relaxation functions ( in the time domain ) are written in terms of mittag - leffler functions ; we also show their graphic representations . in the third section ,",
    "the previously mentioned fractional kinetic equations are solved and the graphs of such solutions are shown . finally , the fourth section , dedicated to the conclusions , presents a comparative analysis of the results obtained and to the discussion of outline a proposal for future study .",
    "the most important phenomenon associated with a dielectric material is its polarization , which consists in the change of the distribution of its molecular and atomic charges when it is subjected to the action of an electric field .",
    "thus , when an electric field is applied to a dialectric it produces a very small electric current called dielectric loss , and its constituent particles , ions or molecules suffer small dislocations or rearrangements , thus altering their equilibrium positions @xcite . these molecular parts do not leave nor reach their state of equilibrium instantaneously : a variable ammount of time is necessary for this change of positions to take place .",
    "this time lapse necessary for the material to respond to the electric field applied is called relaxation time .",
    "thus , when submitted to an electric excitation , the dielectric will respond to this action in an attempt to reestablish its equilibrium during and after the electric stimulus .",
    "the polarization of each dielectric material depends on the nature of its molecular and atomic chemical bonds , and there is presently no universal model which can explain the polarization phenomenon in all materials @xcite .",
    "debye s response function was the first theoretical model for the dielectric behavior of some substances @xcite .",
    "however , due to its limitations , this model is incapable of describing in detail the dielectric response of a large number of solids and liquids .",
    "therefore , in the years following the appearance of debye s theory , several other response functions were proposed in the literature to serve as models for describing the dielectric relaxation of many materials . among them , we here focus our attention on the model proposed by the cole brothers @xcite , and the one by cole - davidson @xcite , both of which emerged in attempts to adjust the response function to the experimental behavior of some dielectric materials .",
    "there is also the model of h - n @xcite which can be considered a generalization of the latter models .",
    "these last three models , called anomalous models , are the most relevant in the literature ; however , there are other models which approach the phenomena from a different perspective , as the models by weron and collaborators @xcite , hilfer @xcite , hanyga and seredynska @xcite .    during the last years , some of these authors and others not mentioned above",
    "have addressed the anomalous relaxation processes of types c - c , c - d and h - n with the help of fractional calculus , for example , by associating the response functions to the mittag - leffler functions ( which turn out to be related with the complex susceptibility @xmath6 through the laplace transform ) @xcite ; by modeling relaxation processes through equations with fractional derivatives , whose solutions are also given in terms of mittag - leffler functions ; and establishing other theoretical connections discovered through the use of fractional calculus tools .",
    "+ in 1929 , debye conceived a simple model for the relaxation process in which he supposed a unique relaxation time for all molecules , obtaining the following expression @xcite :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the complex susceptibility , @xmath9 is the complex permittivity of the dielectric , the real value @xmath10 is the low frequency dielectric constant , the real value @xmath11 is the high frequency dielectric constant and @xmath12 is the constant associated to the dipole s characteristic relaxation time .",
    "cole and collaborators @xcite formulated a more complete model based on experimental data on dielectrics .",
    "this new formulation contains a parameter @xmath13 which can assume values between @xmath14 and @xmath15 and is given by @xmath16 in their studies of the dielectric relaxation process , c - d @xcite proposed a modified equation for the dielectric liquids glycerol and propylene - glycol .",
    "they also studied @xmath17-propanol and confirmed that , in its case , the process is described by debye s equation .",
    "the difference from the former two liquids lies in the broadening of the dispersion range under higher frequencies @xcite .",
    "the works of c - d @xcite allowed for an almost complete determination of the dielectric properties and a more accurate quantitative description . the empirical expression for the complex susceptibility @xmath18",
    "is given by : @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "in their works , h - n @xcite studied the complex dielectric behavior of twenty - one polymers and noticed that they had approximately the same form .",
    "they then arrived at an empirical expression which generalizes the dispersion models of debye , c - c and c - d .",
    "this is the expression representing the relaxation process : @xmath21 it is important to observe that for @xmath22 we have the c - c model , while @xmath23 takes to c - d model and , finally , with @xmath24 we recover the first model proposed by debye .",
    "the properties of dielectric materials are usually described by two constants @xmath25 and @xmath26 which are called dielectric constants ( or loss factors ) .",
    "they can be combined in a complex dielectric constant given by @xmath27 this constant , known as complex dielectric permittivity , is given by the following superposition relation @xcite : @xmath28(i\\omega)= 1-i\\omega\\cdot\\tilde{\\varphi}(i\\omega ) , \\label{permiss}\\ ] ] where @xmath29(i\\omega)=\\tilde{f}(i\\omega)$ ] is the laplace transform of @xmath30 in variable @xmath31 .",
    "we have that @xmath32 is the normalized polarization decay function when a macroscopic electric field is removed from its medium .",
    "function @xmath32 contains only the contributions from the relaxation process and we have chosen @xmath33 @xcite .    in the case of linear approximation response , the polarization changes caused by thermal motion are the same as for the macroscopic function dipole relaxation induced by the electric field @xcite . therefore , the laws governing the dipole correlation function @xmath34 are directly related to the kinetic properties and macroscopic structures of the dielectric system , represented by function @xmath32 .",
    "thus , it is possible to equate the relaxation function @xmath32 to the macroscopic dipole correlation function @xmath34 as follows :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the fluctuating macroscopic dipole moment .    in the projection operator formalism developed by mori @xcite and zwanzig @xcite , function @xmath34",
    "is called temporal correlation function , as the dipole correlation function defined above is a specific case of the temporal correlation function .",
    "thus , function @xmath34 , now called temporal correlation function , has the following form in the approximation context @xcite : @xmath37 this is an integro - differential equation which takes into account the effects of memory .",
    "therefore , introducing the concept of an integral memory function given by @xmath38 and using the fact that the relaxation function @xmath32 also satisfies eq.([k ] ) , it is possible to obtain the following relation involving function @xmath32 : @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes a convolution product .",
    "the relations given by eqs.([convolucao ] ) and ( [ permiss ] ) can now be used to calculate the integral memory function @xmath36 . applying the laplace transform to eq.([convolucao ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the laplace transform of @xmath36 .    substituting eq.([funclaplace ] ) into eq.([permiss ] ) , we obtain the following relation : @xmath43    comparing the relation expressed by eq.([funcaodem ] ) with the classical empirical laws ( [ debye])-([havrinegami ] ) ( where @xmath6 ) , it is possible to obtain the corresponding memory functions : @xmath44    applying the inverse laplace transform to functions ( [ ms1])-([ms4 ] ) we find that the memory functions in the time variable are respectively given by : @xmath45,\\label{mt3}\\\\ \\mbox{h - n}&\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,&m_{hn}(t)=\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\left(\\frac{t}{\\sigma}\\right)^{\\alpha\\beta(k+1)}t^{-1}e_{\\alpha,\\alpha\\beta(k+1)}^{\\beta(k+1)}\\left[-\\left(\\frac{t}{\\sigma}\\right)^{\\alpha}\\right],\\label{mt4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath46 , @xmath47 and where @xmath48 is the mittag - leffler function with three parameters .",
    "this function contains as particular cases the mittag - leffler with two parameters ( @xmath49 ) and one parameter ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the mittag - leffler functions with two and three parameters are defined , respectively , by @xmath51 and @xmath52 where re(@xmath53)@xmath54 , re(@xmath55)@xmath54 , re(@xmath56)@xmath54 and @xmath57 is the pochhammer symbol . substituting the memory functions given by eqs.([mt1])-([mt4 ] ) into eq.([convolucao ] ) , it is posssible to obtain the kinetic equations associated with the models of debye , c - c , c - d and h - n , respectively : @xmath58e^{x/\\sigma}\\varphi(x)dx\\right\\}=0,\\\\ \\mbox{h - n } & & \\frac{d}{dt}\\left\\{\\varphi(t)+\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\int_0^t\\frac{(t - x)^{\\alpha\\beta(k+1)-1}}{\\sigma^{\\alpha\\beta(k+1)}}e_{\\alpha,\\alpha\\beta(k+1)}^{\\beta(k+1)}\\left[-\\left(\\frac{t - x}{\\sigma}\\right)^{\\alpha}\\right]\\varphi(x)dx\\right\\}=0.\\label{eqcin4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] expression @xmath59 denotes the riemann - liouville fractional derivative , defined by @xmath60 the solutions of kinetic equations ( [ eqcin1])-([eqcin4 ] ) are given respectively by : @xmath61,\\label{cc}\\\\ \\mbox{c - d}&\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,&\\varphi_{cd}(t)=1-\\left(\\frac{t}{\\sigma}\\right)^{\\beta}e_{1,\\beta+1}^{\\beta}\\left[-\\frac{t}{\\sigma}\\right],\\label{cd}\\\\ \\mbox{h - n}&\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,&\\varphi_{hn}(t)=1-\\left(\\frac{t}{\\sigma}\\right)^{\\alpha\\beta}e_{\\alpha,\\alpha\\beta+1}^{\\beta}\\left[-\\left(\\frac{t}{\\sigma}\\right)^{\\alpha}\\right].\\label{hn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the graphic representation of solutions ( [ debye0])-([hn ] ) can be seen in figures @xmath15 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively . ] .",
    "as mentioned above , the generalization of the laws describing anomalous relaxation phenomena in dielectrics has been the object of studies by several important researchers .",
