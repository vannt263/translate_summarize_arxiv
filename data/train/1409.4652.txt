    "the experimental evidence of @xmath0 suppression by na50  @xcite , na60  @xcite as well as by the phenix  @xcite collaboration has long been suggested as a signal of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation in heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "however , other mechanisms such as the @xmath0 absorption by comoving hadrons have also been proposed as an alternative mechanism to explain the suppression  @xcite , indicating that the inelastic scattering rates of @xmath0 in the hadronic phase is significant  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the opening of @xmath1 decay in the medium due to in - medium modification of d mesons  @xcite may also play a significant role in @xmath0 suppression in a hadronic environment .",
    "heavy quark transport in hadronic matter is a topic of high contemporary interest  @xcite .",
    "the drag and diffusion of open charm  @xcite and bottom  @xcite mesons and the role of hadronic matter in their suppression in heavy ion collisions  @xcite have been investigated using effective hadronic interactions based on heavy quark effective theory .",
    "the suppression of heavy flavors in the hadronic phase in comparison to qgp was found to be smaller at lhc than at rhic , suggesting that the characterization of qgp at lhc would be less complicated than at rhic  @xcite .",
    "recently we have obtained the drag and diffusion of the @xmath2 baryon in hadronic matter  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) and found those to be significant .",
    "in fact , the drag of the @xmath2 being lower than that of the @xmath3 mesons was seen to non - trivially affect the @xmath4 dependence of the @xmath5 ratio and thus the @xmath6 of single electrons originating from the decay of @xmath2 .",
    "motivated by these results we proceed to study the temperature variation of the drag and diffusion coefficients of @xmath0 and @xmath7 in a comoving hadronic medium . for evaluating these quantities the required interaction cross sections",
    "have been evaluated employing an effective hadronic lagrangian .",
    "drag and diffusion coefficients have also been estimated using t - matrix elements extracted from scattering lengths obtained from lattice qcd calculations .    in the next section we provide the formulae for the drag and diffusion coefficients followed by a discussion on the matrix elements of elastic scattering of the @xmath0 with the light vector mesons in section iii .",
    "results are given in section iv and finally a summary in section v. we provide the squared matrix elements in the appendix .",
    "the drag ( @xmath8 ) and diffusion ( @xmath3 ) coefficients of @xmath0 and @xmath7 are obtained from the elastic scattering of @xmath0 with the light thermal hadrons ( @xmath9 ) which constitute the equilibrated thermal medium . for the process @xmath10",

    "the drag coefficient of eq.([eq1 ] ) is just a measure of the thermal average of the momentum transfer , @xmath16 weighted by the square of the invariant amplitude @xmath17 for the elastic scattering of @xmath0 and @xmath7 with thermal hadrons , generically denoted as @xmath9 .    in a similar way",

    "t(p_3 )  , [ transport ] where @xmath20 , is the triangular function .",
    "in this section we will discuss the two body elastic scattering of @xmath0 with the constituent hadrons in the medium within the framework of su(4 ) symmetry .",
    "some of the relevant features of these interactions are mentioned below and for details we refer to  @xcite to avoid repetition .",
    "the aim of the present work is to estimate the momentum diffusion coefficient of hot hadrons produced as a result of phase transitions from an expanding qgp formed in heavy ion collisions at relativistic energies .",
    "that is we would like to understand how efficiently the momentum of the @xmath0 propagating through a hadronic medium is transferred to the medium enabling to estimate momentum diffusion or shear viscous coefficient of the medium  @xcite . since @xmath0 is used here as a probe to extract the coefficient of momentum diffusion for characterizing the medium , its detection in the final reaction channel is essential .",
    "therefore , the inelastic processes which kill the @xmath0 are not considered here .",
    "for this reason , we consider only the two body elastic processes _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath21 , in the present work ( @xmath22 s are hadrons in the medium ) .",
    "although , @xmath0 appears in the final channel in the processes like @xmath23 , analogous to the gluon bremsstrahlung by heavy quarks in the qgp phase , are also ignored , as their contributions may be smaller than the two body elastic processes .",
    "the hot hadronic matter produced in the later stages of relativistic heavy ion collisions is populated by light pseudo - scalars and vector mesons like @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the magnitude of hadronic scatterings are estimated either by introducing different perturbative or non - perturbative approach at quark level  @xcite or by using an effective lagrangian to calculate feynman diagrams .",
    "concerning the latter approach , the su(4 ) is the smallest possible symmetry group which includes the charmonium state explicitly along with the light and heavy pseudo - scalar and vector mesons .",
    "the corresponding pseudo - scalar and vector meson matrices as well as the chiral lagrangian are given in refs .",
    "@xcite which can be readily used for the present purpose of evaluating the drag and diffusion coefficients of @xmath0 in hadronic matter . since su(4 )",
    "symmetry is badly broken by the large mass of the charmed meson , terms involving hadron masses are included in the chiral lagrangian using the experimentally determined values of su(4 ) model parameters .",
    "since pions are identified with the nambu - goldstone bosons of qcd their interaction strength with other hadrons should abruptly decrease in the chiral limit .",
    "we recall the standard relation  @xcite for the s - wave scattering length of pion with a heavy meson like @xmath0 , @xmath26 with the dot product defined as , @xmath27.\\ ] ] @xmath28 are respectively the isospin quantum numbers of the pion and @xmath0 and @xmath29 represents their total isospin quantum number . in the chiral limit ( @xmath30 ) , the first term of eq.([scat_pion ] ) exactly vanishes . when the other hadron is @xmath0 or @xmath7 , this term in ( [ scat_pion ] ) vanishes exactly , not only in the chiral limit but also for finite pion mass ( because @xmath31 ) .",
    "hence the contribution of the pion in the charmonium scattering length starts from @xmath32 , which indicates that at least at low energy the pion - charmonium interaction is weak .",
    "this is in confirmation with the results obtained using the meson exchange model of haglin et.al  @xcite , where it was found that the elastic channels of @xmath0 interaction involving the light pseudo - scalars are significantly smaller in comparison with the vector mesons .",
    "they have found that @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 elastic cross sections with @xmath0 are of order 100 fb , 1 nb and 100 nb respectively . on the other hand",
    "the contributions for elastic scattering with @xmath36 and @xmath25 mesons are quantitatively much larger , up to about a few mb .",
    "hence , the elastic scattering of the heavy charmonium states like @xmath0 and @xmath7 with vector mesons are considered here .",

    "i.e. _ the main conclusion of this work is not affected by the variation in the values of drag obtained within the ambit of the two approaches adopted here .",

    "of late the shear viscosity ( @xmath34 ) to entropy density ( @xmath44 ) ratio ( @xmath68 ) has been considered as an useful quantity to characterize the matter formed in heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc energies .",
    "the value of this ratio is found to be small from the analysis of experimental data  @xcite , which led to the conclusion that the matter formed in these collision behaves like a perfect liquid .    in the present work",
    "we find that the momentum diffusion of @xmath0 is small _ i.e. _ the transfer of momentum between @xmath0 and hadrons is inefficient which means that the shear viscosity is large  @xcite .",
    "this again indicates that the role of hadrons in the suppression of @xmath0 in the high momentum domain is inconsequential compared to qgp .",
    "it may be mentioned that the role of the nucleons has been neglected in evaluating the drag and diffusion coefficients of @xmath0 and @xmath7 within the ambit of effective lagrangian approach here .",
