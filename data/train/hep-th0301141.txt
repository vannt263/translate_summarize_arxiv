    "recently  @xcite the decay of uniformly accelerated protons as described from the point of view of inertial and coaccelerated observers was used as a paradigmatic example of the necessity of the fulling - davies - unruh effect  @xcite to the consistency of quantum field theory . at the same time",
    ", it was shown that in addition to its conceptual importance , the decay of accelerated protons could be of `` practical '' relevance to astrophysics .",
    "it was estimated that about 1% of a bunch of protons with energy @xmath1  ev would decay ( through weak interaction ) if they were under the influence of a magnetic field of @xmath1  gauss of a pulsar  @xcite .",
    "the proton decay can be understood in this case as being induced by the centripetal force acting on the proton as it swirls around the magnetic field lines .",
    "the estimative above was obtained , however , by using the decay rate of _ uniformly accelerated _ protons rather than circularly moving ones .",
    "it was argued that this procedure should lead to good approximate results as far as the proton proper acceleration satisfies the constraint @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the neutron - proton mass difference and @xmath4 is the local curvature radius of the proton trajectory .",
    "thus , as a step further , it would be desirable to refine our previous estimative by considering protons in circular motion indeed . for this purpose , here we apply the formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( designed to study the weak - interaction emission of spin-@xmath0 fermions from classical and semiclassical currents ) to the case of circularly moving particles with constant velocity ( hereafter denominated _ uniformly swirling particles _ ) .",
    "we focus on the decay of uniformly swirling protons and on the neutrino - antineutrino emission from uniformly swirling electrons which is also relevant in some astrophysical situations as , e.g. , in the cooling of neutron stars and in connection with high - energy neutrinos emitted from the magnetosphere of pulsars  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we emphasize that a broad class of interesting processes involving accelerated particles possessing well defined world lines can be analyzed in this fashion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "[ proton ] we analyze in detail the decay of uniformly swirling protons and comment on its potential importance to astrophysics .",

    "as the typical energy @xmath20 of the emitted fermions is of the order of the proper acceleration @xmath21 of the particle @xmath11 , the no - recoil condition can be recast as  @xcite @xmath22    the particles @xmath11 and @xmath12 will be seen as distinct energy eigenstates @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , of a two - level system .",

    "we note that we did not take into account the influence of the magnetic field on the emitted positron .",
