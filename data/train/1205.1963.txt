    "during the last decade , ground- and space - based surveys have been very successful in detecting transiting exoplanets .",
    "in addition to their primary science goal , the large photometric data sets acquired by them allow studying millions of stars for variability .",
    "numerous projects thus provide an exceedingly increasing number of detections that are collected by variable star catalogs such as the general catalogue of variable stars ( gcvs ; * ? ? ? * ) or the variable star index ( vsx ) .",
    "such catalogs not only broaden the statistical sample of variable stars , but are also important to gain further knowledge about the different processes that cause stellar variability .",
    "several methods have been proposed to search for periodic signals in astronomical time series ( for a good overview , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one of the most widely applied algorithms is the analysis of variance ( aov ) statistic @xcite , which provides an optimal period search in uneven sampled observations .",
    "it has been used very successfully by projects like hat @xcite , wasp ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or ogle ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the @xmath0  index @xcite is frequently used to quantify variability in general and/or for selecting candidate stars prior to a period search in order to minimize computation time ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .    however , both methods  the aov period search and stetson s variability index  are strongly affected by systematic trends present in ground - based data sets ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most dominant are diurnal systematics , introducing artificial variability with periods of one day or multiples thereof . such trends generally yield a higher ranking of non - variable stars , thus increasing the false alarm rate . a common approach to account for candidates with systematic variability",
    "is to set limits , e.g. , to exclude detections within certain period ranges .",
    "however , any such manual mechanism is usually not well applicable to other data sets or projects , and the number of missed detections ( false negatives ) is often unknown .",
    "therefore , a more sophisticated treatment of systematic variability in combination with period search and ranking is needed .",
    "the berlin exoplanet search telescope ( best ; * ? ? ? * ) and best  ii @xcite are used to perform ground - based support of the corot space mission @xcite . by obtaining high - precision and long - time series photometry of the corot target fields prior to the satellite s observations , planetary candidates",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the obtained light curves can be used to identify variable stars .",
    "the best project has already yielded the detection of several hundreds of new periodic variable stars @xcite .",
    "a first characterization of periodic stellar variability in the corot field lra02 has been published by @xcite . following the detections from this first publication ( denoted as paper  i hereafter )",
    ", it was possible to optimize the best  ii reduction pipeline .",
    "the large , well - characterized data set lra02 was used as a proxy to analyze and automatically include systematic biases in the variable star candidate selection and period search , yielding a significantly reduced false alarm rate .",
    "the optimized procedure to rank periodic variable stars is described in this paper .",
    "in addition , we present a large catalog extension to the variable star classification in lra02 that was obtained through the reanalysis and compare our results to publicly available corot data .",
    "best ii is located at the observatorio cerro armazones , chile .",
    "it is operated by the _",
    "institut fr planetenforschung _ of the _ deutsches zentrum fr luft- und raumfahrt _ in robotic mode from berlin since summer 2007 .",
    "the system consists of a 25 cm baker - ritchey - chrtien telescope with a focal ratio of @xmath1 , yielding a wide field of view ( fov ) of @xmath2 .",
    "it is equipped with a 4k @xmath3 4k , 16 bit finger lakes imager ccd ( kaf-16801e1 ) with a pixel size of 9  @xmath4 m , and an angular resolution of @xmath5 pixel@xmath6 . best  ii observes without any filter to maximize the photon yield  the ccd sensitivity peaks at 650 nm and is roughly comparable to the johnson @xmath7 band .",
    "the corot long - run field lra02 was observed by best ii for 41 nights from 2007 november to 2008 february prior to the satellite observations .",
    "as the fov of corot is slightly larger than best ii , we split the field into two subfields ( called lra02a and lra02b , respectively ) and pointed at them alternating .",
    "paper  i indicates their corresponding center coordinates and shows the orientation with respect to the corot fov ( figure  1 in paper  i ) .",
    "the acquired data set was calibrated and reduced using the best automated photometric data pipeline as outlined in @xcite . the actual reduction procedure for the field lra02",
    "has already been described in detail in paper  i and below only those steps relevant to the new results are discussed .    in paper",
    "i , kabath et al .  reported the detection of 350 periodic variable stars ( of which five were previously known ) .",
    "their selection was based upon the variability index  @xmath0 @xcite , calculated for each star by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is indexing individual data points .",
    "@xmath10 is calculated from each pair of subsequent magnitudes @xmath11 and @xmath12 using the corresponding normalized residuals @xmath13 and @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the uncertainty of measurement @xmath9 , @xmath17 the mean magnitude , and @xmath18 the number of measurements for the selected star . the weights @xmath19 in equation  ( [ eq : jindex1 ] )",

    "@xcite finally identified 173 periodic variables in lra02a and 177 in lra02b .",
    "in the best archive , some stars are marked as clear variables with large @xmath0 indices ( up to 10 and higher ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : jhist ] shows the count of all stars in subfield lra02b and the corresponding number of variable star detections in paper  i as a function of the @xmath0  index .",
    "altogether , the large number of false positives shows that the @xmath0  index alone is not an effective criterion for selecting variable stars .",
    "furthermore , a number of clear detections with low @xmath0 values indicates that several variables must have been missed in paper  i due to the cutoff .        in order to improve the quality of our preselection process and to maximize the detection yield",
    ", we performed a deeper analysis of our data set lra02 .",
    "field lra02 was chosen for this purpose because it was observed with longest duration within the best project so far .",
    "the performed reanalysis consisted of three main steps .",
    "first , the best period was searched in all light curves from the initial data set without any preselection criterion , i.e. , directly using the aov multiharmonic algorithm for _ all _ stars in both subsets .",
    "each of the resulting 37,361 folded light curves in lra02a and 66,974 in lra02b was then examined visually for periodic stellar variability .",
    "in addition to the variable stars from paper  i , this first step already revealed 189 _ additional _ variable stars that were not detected in our first publication . during this step",
    ", we also discovered a bug in our implementation of the @xmath0  index that yielded systematically lower values especially for short periods , which is why many of these detections show periods of less than a day .",
    "second , the combined data set of variable stars from paper  i and the additional manual detections were used to optimize the best  ii selection process ( see next section  [ sec : limitimprove ] ) . with a very good knowledge of this data set",
    ", it was possible to compare different selection methods and to adjust their corresponding parameters .",
    "third , the new search algorithm was applied to the data set with optimized parameters .",
    "the improvements to the pipeline finally lead to an increase of detections by another 135 variable stars that were not found during all previous steps ( see section  [ sec : results : newmethod ] ) .",
    "the deep analysis of the best ii data set lra02 gives us the opportunity to study the performance of variability search algorithms in detail .",
    "the aim is to recover all variable stars in the data set automatically and to minimize the number of false alarms ( and manpower ) at the same time .    in this section ,",
    "we show the limitations of the @xmath0  index with regard to systematic trends ( section  [ sec : jlimit ] ) , describe how to quantify the performance of a variability search ( section  [ sec : limitimprove1 ] ) , present the algorithms tested ( sections  [ sec : limitimprove2 ] and [ sec : limitimprove3 ] ) , and finally compare the performance of different approaches and parameters ( section  [ sec : limitimprove4 ] ) .",

    "most new variable star detections are found in the region between @xmath30 and the cutoff limit of @xmath28 from paper  i. a small number of new variables with @xmath31 were not detected in paper  i because their @xmath0 indices have been initially underestimated ( see section [ sec : reanalysis ] ) .",
    "the dominant variation in many light curves is due to diurnal systematics , aliasing , or a combination of both .",
    "figure  [ fig : jper ] shows a large accumulation of stars having periods of one day or integral fractions / multiples thereof , often in combination with large @xmath0  indices .",
    "consequently , this leads to a very high number of false alarms when using the stetson index as the only criterion for variability selection . in the example of the data set lra02 , a cutoff limit of @xmath30 would be sufficient to include all variable stars in the selection sample , but",
    "only @xmath32 of all light curves would be sorted out .",
    "the remaining large sample of 31,000 stars is mainly affected by systematic effects and contains only 681 stars with real physical variability ( see section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "the corresponding false alarm rate of about 98% shows the need for an automated treatment of systematic variability , which is not part of the @xmath0  index .",
    "two fundamental criteria are used to assess the quality of period search algorithms : the significance of the detection itself and the correct determination of the frequency of variability .",
    "first , a quantity @xmath33 is introduced to evaluate the detection efficiency of any given search algorithm .",
    "detection methods are usually based upon a single numerical value @xmath34 ( e.g. , the stetson index , @xmath35 ) that can be used to prioritize a candidate list .",
    "the success of ranking variable stars high in the list is measured with @xmath33 for each tested search algorithm .",
    "it ranges from 0 for the perfect algorithm ( all previously identified variable stars listed first ) to 1 ( listed last ) .",
    "for details on the calculation of @xmath33 see the appendix .",

    "however , the precision in the periods of these two binaries could be significantly improved because the lra02 data set covers a much larger time period ( 41 compared to 12 nights ) and the photometric quality of best  ii is better .",
    "the lra02 data sets of best  ii and corot are , except for the fact that they point to the same field , completely independent of each other and thus provide a great opportunity to compare the scientific results of the two surveys .",

    "the automatic classification @xcite provides information about the amplitude of variation for corot targets . because the satellite has a much higher photometric precision , most of these amplitudes are well below the detection limit of best  ii .",
    "however , the knowledge of stellar variability with higher precision can be used to evaluate the detection efficiency of best  ii .",
    "of particular interest are two questions : first , how many stars with sufficiently high variation in the corot data set have been detected as variables from best  ii data .",
    "second , if these are clearly distinguished by the new detection algorithm from the rest of stars having variabilities below the threshold of best  ii .",
    "the full amplitude @xmath181 of variation was derived from the fit coefficients given in the corot classification .",
    "as this contains each a low- and high - frequency entry for every corot target , the amplitude was calculated as the maximum of both .",
    "the value @xmath181 itself contains no information on whether the signal can be detected by best  ii or not , which strongly depends on the magnitude of a given star .",

    "the distinction between variable and non - variable stars works very well using the new ranking quantity @xmath111max}}}}^{(2)})$ ] ( see section  [ sec : limitimprove ] ) . if the limit @xmath187 is chosen to separate variables from the bulk of non - variable stars , 92% of all matched stars are found below the limit .",
    "only seven variables have @xmath185 , but their light curves and low s / n indicate rather false detections than too low variability values . from all 780 stars with @xmath186 , one third belongs to the set of variable star detections . for comparison ,",
    "figure  [ fig : detefficiency ] also shows the @xmath0 index vs.  the expected s / n .",
    "the plot shows clearly that the separation between real and artifical variability is much weaker .",
    "the strength of the new ranking is particularly clear in the regime of @xmath188 , i.e. , close to the detection limit of best  ii .",
    "the variable star detections of best  ii were compared in detail with the automatic corot classification for the 262 matched variables .",
    "the overall agreement between both methods is very good ; details regarding the period and magnitude determination as well as the classifications obtained by best  ii and corot are given in the remainder of this section .",
    "figure  [ fig : lcs : corot ] shows some instructive examples of variable stars in agreement ( a ) and with differences in the determined periods and/or classifications ( ( b)(f ) ) .",
    "( a )      ( b )      ( c )      ( d )      ( e )      ( f )    the mean magnitudes of matched stars are in reasonably good agreement ( figure  [ fig : bestcorot : mag ] ) .",
    "only a few very long - term variables  like the example in figure  [ fig : lcs : corot](d )  show differences in the order of 1  mag and above because best  ii and corot observed during different phases ; the remaining majority differs by only @xmath189 mag .",
    "periods determined by best  ii have been compared with the main frequency from the automatic corot characterization . for 72.5% of the matched stars , the periods are equal or integral ( @xmath190 ) multiples of each other to a precision of at least 1% .",
    "the histogram of period ratios in figure  [ fig : bestcorot : per ] shows that most detections have been identified in the corot data with half the period compared to best  ii .",
    "this is because many periods are doubled during the visual inspection of best  ii light curves in order to show full cycles ( e.g. , figures  [ fig : lcs : corot](c ) and  [ fig : lcs : corot](e ) ) , in particular for w  ursae majoris eclipsing binaries ( ew ) .",
    "the classes from visual inspection of best  ii light curves match the automatic classification of the corot data set well .",
    "from the 262 variables present in both data sets , 196 stars have best  ii variability classes that are consistent with either the short- or long - periodic classification in the corot data set . note that the variability classes used by best  ii and corot are slightly different : for example , best  ii distinguishes within the corot class ecl between the eclipsing binary types ea , eb , and ew , while the corot scheme includes , e.g. , slowly pulsating b - stars , which are simply identified as var within the best  ii study .",
    "all such consistent refinements are considered a classification match .",
    "the 64 stars with a clear disagreement in the variability classifications were checked carefully by reviewing the light curves from both best  ii and corot . for 26 stars , the variability classes obtained by best",
    "ii appear more realistic .",
    "most of such cases are lp variable stars ( e.g. , figure  [ fig : lcs : corot](d ) ) that have been identified as such in the best  ii data set by visual inspection . for these cases ,",
    "even the longer corot baseline does not cover a full cycle , so that the period and classification obtained from the corot pipeline are not conclusive .",
    "furthermore , some eclipsing binaries are clearly misclassified by the automatic corot procedure . figure  [ fig : lcs : corot](e ) shows an example of a w  ursae majoris type eclipsing binary that was identified as an rr lyrae pulsator ",
    "most likely because it was detected with half of its physical period from the corot data set . for three stars similar to the example in figure  [ fig : lcs : corot](b ) ,",
    "narrow eclipse events were not detected by the corot analysis .",
    "most of the stars with implausible variability types were classified as be by the automatic classification , which was described by @xcite as a `` trash '' class regarding its wide parameter spread . for 16 stars like the example in figure  [ fig : lcs : corot](f ) , the corot classifications are in better agreement with the measurements . for most of these cases ,",
    "this clearly results from the better photometric quality of the satellite data . for 22 cases ,",
    "the photometric data itself are insufficient to choose between the corot and best  ii classifications ( e.g. , ew / ell ) .",
    "no automatic classification data were available for the two corot targets 110833621 and 300001413 .",
    "the corot target field lra02 was observed with best  ii during 41 nights from 2007 november to 2008 february ( see paper  i ) .",
    "we reanalyzed the data set in order to improve the detection method and to maximize the number of detections .",
    "in addition to the 350 periodic variable stars already published earlier ( paper  i ) , we present a catalog of 272 new variables and 52 stars with suspected variability . for seven known variables both the classifications and periods are confirmed , and the periods could significantly be improved for two of them .",
    "revised ephemerides are presented for 17 variable stars from paper  i.    from a manual inspection of all light curves without any preselection criterion , it turned out that most of the new periodic variable stars went undetected in paper  i because the applied variability criterion using the stetson @xmath0  index was too restrictive . but",
    "because the @xmath0  index is heavily biased by systematic effects , a smaller cutoff limit leads to very high false alarm rates ( @xmath191 ) and is therefore not a practical alternative .",
    "however , although the @xmath0  index is not capable to distinguish between systematic and stellar variability , it can still be used to exclude non - variable stars from the analysis : no variable star is falsely rejected if light curves with low variability indices @xmath192 are sorted out in both data sets of this study .",
    "this separation can be particularly useful if the full aov process is too time consuming for a whole data set .",
    "the deep characterization of the data set enabled us to compare and train different automatic methods for an improved variability ranking .",
    "in particular , a master power spectrum was calculated as the mean of all individual aov spectra .",
    "this method proved a valuable tool for exclusion of systematic frequencies and hence the ranking of real variability .",
    "the best algorithm found separates variable stars very effectively from the non - variable background population and in parallel recovers their frequencies well .",
    "the new ranking method is particularly superior to the @xmath0 index in regimes where the amplitude of variation becomes comparable to the noise level , i.e. , close to the detection limit of the photometric system .",
    "it shows an almost equal performance for both independent subsets lra02a and lra02b , so that it should be easily applicable to other data sets .",
    "finally , the results from both paper  i and this work have been compared with the publicly available corot data set .",
    "best  ii obtained light curves for 91% of all corot targets in lra02 . from all 681 variable stars observed with best  ii in the field , 262 are matched with corot targets .",
    "stellar amplitudes measured by corot show that best  ii detects variability efficiently in its parameter range .",
    "the results of period determination and variability classification are found to be in very good overall agreement , confirming the validity of the measurements , data reduction , and scientific analysis of both projects .",
    "196 stars show consistent classifications .",
    "corot yields a better classification in case of small variability for 16 targets , e.g. , be stars . on the other hand , the final visual screening of folded best  ii light curves proves to be an important step in the analysis . for 26 stars",
    "it was found to yield a more realistic classification , in particular for eclipsing binaries and stars with variability on time scales comparable to the observational baseline .",

    "<S> this paper describes an empirical approach to treat systematic trends in photometric data based upon the analysis of variance statistics that can significantly decrease the rate of false detections .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , the process of reanalysis and method improvement has virtually doubled the number of variable stars compared to the first analysis by kabath et al . </S>",
    "<S> a supplementary catalog of 272 previously unknown periodic variables plus 52 stars with suspected variability is presented . </S>",
    "<S> improved ephemerides are given for 19 known variables in the field . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the best  ii results are compared with corot data and its automatic variability classification . </S>"
