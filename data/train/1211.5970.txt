    "ultrathin magnetic films where the magnetic easy axis reorients to the film normal are one of the first systems in which the specificities of nanomagnetism became visible . a surface contribution to the magnetic anisotropy of a sample was predicted early by l.  nel @xcite , and much later observed to dominate over the volume terms ( anisotropy and magnetostatic ) in films of thickness below 2  nm , typically , when such samples could be fabricated .    as the magnetic degrees of freedom along the film normal correspond to extremely high energy modes ,",
    "such samples were assimilated to the practical realization of the model system in which the simplest magnetic domain wall ( dw ) exists , namely the bloch wall @xcite . in this wall , the magnetization rotates as a spiral when one travels perpendicularly ( direction @xmath0 ) across the dw , avoiding magnetostatic charges as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the unit vector defining the magnetization direction .",
    "the dw profile is thus governed by the exchange and anisotropy energies , the latter being in the ultrathin limit an effective anisotropy incorporating the perpendicular demagnetizing energy .",
    "as the typical dw widths are of a few nanometers , observations that the dw in such samples are of this type are extremely rare : spin - polarized scanning tunneling microscopy would require to control the orientation of the magnetic moment of the last atom , for example . the most convincing proof was recently obtained in nanostrips of ( co / ni ) multilayer by anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements , where for small nanostrip widths the dw structure was observed @xcite to transform into a nel wall ( nw ) , as expected from micromagnetics @xcite . in the nw ,",
    "the magnetization rotates in a cycloidal mode , i.e. with the dw normal @xmath0 contained in the magnetization rotation plane .",
    "for perpendicular magnetization films that are not patterned into nanostrips , the bw does not have a magnetostatic energy but the nw does , so that indeed the bw is the lowest energy dw structure , justifying the common belief .",
    "however , it was soon recognized that the energy density difference between nw and bw decreases as the film becomes thinner @xcite , because the ` demagnetizing factor ' of the nw reduces as the ratio @xmath3 of film thickness @xmath4 to dw width @xmath5 .",
    "a practical consequence of this is the low walker field and maximum velocity of the bw in these films @xcite .",
    "indeed , the stability of a dw structure against precession around a field applied along the magnetization of the domains is what limits the stationary regime of dw motion , where the largest dw mobility ( velocity to field ratio ) and velocity are obtained .",
    "another direct proof of this low stability of the bw in ultrathin films was recently obtained through the observation , by ballistic electron emission microscopy @xcite , that in coupled films superimposed walls adopt an antiparallel nw structure .",
    "the stray field from the domains in one layer , despite its smallness because of the ultrathin film thickness , indeed overcomes the nw demagnetizing field in the other layer .",
    "all these considerations rest on energy terms that are usually considered in micromagnetics .",
    "recently , another term has been experimentally uncovered in the magnetism of mono- and bilayers , namely the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ( dmi ) @xcite .",
    "this antisymmetric exchange interaction was introduced for low - symmetry crystals @xcite .",
    "it was shown to favor non - uniform magnetic structures @xcite , prominently the nowadays so - called skyrmions . in the context of ultrathin films ,",
    "a.  fert first mentioned that , the symmetry being reduced at the interface , such a term was also allowed @xcite .",
    "this was confirmed by an extensive analytical study @xcite that considered the 2-site @xcite and 3-site @xcite mechanisms .",
    "quantitative calculations of this interaction by ab initio techniques @xcite confirmed its importance for ultrathin films .",
    "starting with the case of 2 monolayers fe epitaxially grown on the w(110 ) surface of a single crystal , studied in depth by spin - polarized scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite , it was shown that the dmi changes the nature of the magnetic dw , forcing the existence of nel walls @xcite .",
    "the dw structure has also been investigated for general values of the parameters and orientation of the dzyaloshinskii vector @xcite , but in a simplified model that does not solve the magnetostatic problem inherent to a nel wall . moreover ,",
    "the practical consequences of the introduction of the dmi on the dw dynamics have not been investigated so far , with the exception of one work @xcite for a soft magnetic material with a dmi of bulk symmetry .    in this paper",
    ", we consider an ultrathin film with perpendicular easy axis , grown on a substrate with a capping from a different material so that the structural inversion symmetry is broken along the film normal ( @xmath6 axis ) , the typical sample being",
    "pt / co(0.6  nm)/alox @xcite .",
    "the film is patterned into a strip , elongated along the @xmath0 axis , of a width below the micrometer but not as small as to induce by magnetostatics the transition to a nel wall @xcite , providing a well - defined geometry to study the dw propagation . as the film is ultrathin ,",

    "the expression ( [ eq : e - dm ] ) shows that indeed the dmi favors nws of a given chirality , fixed by the sign of @xmath17 .",
    "the previous studies of the dw structure under interface dmi @xcite have only considered the statics ( @xmath19 ) and neglected the complex effects of the demagnetizing field : either @xmath20 or a global demagnetizing effect was incorporated into an effective anisotropy . here , we lift these two restrictions .",
    "micromagnetic calculations are performed either in 2d ( the full problem ) , or in a model reduced to 1d ( along the @xmath0 axis ) but with a calculation of the demagnetizing field .",
    "we also show how part of the physics of this dw can be captured using the well - known collective coordinates approach ( the so - called @xmath21 model ) , with suitable modifications . although most of the paper deals with field - driven motion of dw under dmi in ultrathin films , we finally discuss the relevance of the dmi to current - driven dw motion .",
    "the micromagnetic parameters chosen for the simulations are those of the typical sample considered , namely @xmath22",
    "ka / m , @xmath23  pj / m , @xmath24  mj / m@xmath25 .",

    "the longitudinal component of the demagnetizing field is calculated by direct summation with interaction coefficients @xmath33 analytically calculated ( note also that the @xmath6 component of the demagnetizing field can be calculated similarly , with coefficients @xmath34 applied to @xmath35 ) .",

    "the curves are very similar to those of the standard @xmath21 model for bloch walls @xcite .",

    "the quantitative effect is very large : a value @xmath51  mj / m@xmath40 increases @xmath48 by ten times compared to @xmath38 .",
    "the walker velocity follows exactly the same trend , simply because the mobility in the stationary regime is constant ( 1.96  m/(s.mt ) ) .",
    "such a strong effect is physically intuitive : the dmi pins the dw magnetization to the nel orientation , suppressing the precession of dw magnetization and thus extending the stationary regime to higher fields .",
    "the robustness of the above results was tested by comparison to exact , but more demanding , 2d calculations ( with suitably modified homemade @xcite and oommf @xcite codes ) , performed for different nanostrip widths @xmath52  nm and @xmath53  mj / m@xmath40 .",

    "neither a continuous rotation of the dw magnetization along the length of the wall , nor a tilt of the wall , were observed , so that the 1d model is justified , as it describes a stable structure .",
    "all quantities ( dw width , walker field , etc . ) were found to be slightly modified , mainly because of the assumption of a local @xmath6 demagnetizing field with @xmath54 , so that the effective anisotropy is larger and the dw width lower .",
    "the small variations , observed above the walker field , are due to the transverse degrees of freedom ( see ref .",

    "the starting point is to express the dw surface energy @xmath57 @xcite . as seen above , for the typical system",
    "that we consider the dw width is practically constant .",
    "we therefore assume that the wall width parameter is a constant @xmath58 .",

    "the 1d calculations show that this is not the case , neither far from the dw as @xmath60 decays slowly whereas @xmath61 does not , nor around the center of the wall when driven by a field .",
    "nevertheless , this assumption allows a crucial simplification and the final results match quite well with 1d calculations , as shown below . in these conditions ,",

    "comparison with the curve of the standard model ( @xmath38 ) shows some difference only in the regime where @xmath49 is not so much above @xmath48 , as may be anticipated .",
    "a first hint that the dw in ultrathin pt / co ( 0.6)/alox films is not a simple bw is provided by the dw dynamics under field only in this sample @xcite , compared to those of a series of pt / co(t)/pt with @xmath83  nm @xcite : the velocity in the flow regime is indeed at least 5 times larger in the former case ( the comparison is not so direct as the co / alox interface gives more interface anisotropy than the co / pt interface ) .",
    "the latter study concluded that the flow regime was precessional , with @xmath84 , the stationary regime being hidden by the dw pinning . as a result , the high mobility observed for pt / co / alox can only be obtained in the stationary regime , but in that case the walker field would be smaller than the fields applied ( up to 120  mt ) .",

    "one test of the nw structure due to dmi is to measure the dw dynamics under a @xmath6 field , with an additional in - plane field along the @xmath0 direction .",
    "indeed , in simple terms , this field favours opposite chiralities for up - down and down - up walls , competing with the dmi .",
    "the results of the full 1d model for this case are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1d - dyn - xj]a , for an up - down wall with @xmath86  mj / m@xmath40 .",

    "the figure thus shows that @xmath87  mj / m@xmath40 is equivalent to a stabilizing field @xmath88  mt , which is exactly the value @xmath89 of the average over the dw of the equivalent @xmath90 field deduced from eq .",
    "( [ eq : e - dm ] ) .",

    "recent work @xcite , has revealed that the nature of the dws in such samples is very important . indeed , to explain the anomalously large dw velocity under current in pt / co / alox , a magnetic effect of the rashba field at the interfaces has been proposed @xcite . on the other hand , a spin hall effect ( she ) due to the current flowing in the pt or ta buffer layer has also been considered @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the action of these torques @xcite shows that for perpendicular materials the she can efficiently move nws at zero field and in opposite directions for opposite chiralities . this has been directly proven in the pt / co / pt case @xcite , by preparing nw with moderate @xmath0 fields and observing a current assisted depinning only for the nw . in that structure",
    ", the sign of the she was moreover controlled by the relative thicknesses of the two pt layers , and a strong dmi is not expected as the effects of both interfaces compensate .",

    "its direction of motion with respect to the current direction is given by the sign of the dmi parameter and the she film position ( above or below the magnetic film ) .",
    "in addition , as the nws induced by dmi have a fixed chirality , all walls will be pushed in the same direction under current by the she .",
    "this feature is highly desirable in applications where one wants to obtain the motion of a train of dw in the same direction ( race - track memory for example ) .",
