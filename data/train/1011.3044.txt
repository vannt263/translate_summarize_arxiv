    "galaxy clusters provide an independent means of examining any viable model of cosmic structure formation through the growth of structure and by the form of their equilibrium mass profiles , complementing cosmic microwave background and galaxy clustering observations",
    ". a consistent framework of structure formation requires that most of the matter in the universe is in the hitherto unknown form of dark matter , of an unknown nature , and that most of the energy filling the universe today is in the form of a mysterious `` dark energy '' , characterized by a negative pressure .",
    "this model actually requires that the expansion rate of the universe has recently changed sign and is currently accelerating .",
    "clusters play a direct role in testing cosmological models , providing several independent checks of any viable cosmology , including the current consensus @xmath11 cold dark matter ( @xmath11cdm ) model .",
    "a spectacular example has been recently provided from detailed lensing and x - ray observations of the `` bullet cluster '' ( aka , ie0657 - 56 ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , which is a consequence of a high - speed collision between two cluster components with a mass ratio of the order of @xmath12 @xcite , displaying a prominent bow shock preceding a cool bullet lying between the two clusters , implying these clusters passed through each other recently @xcite . here",
    "the bullet system reveals lensing mass contours that follow the bimodal distribution of cluster members , demonstrating that the bulk of the dark matter is relatively collisionless as galaxies @xcite , as also shown by a comprehensive analysis of galaxy and dark - matter dynamics for a1689 @xcite .",
    "other cases of merging systems show that in general displacement of the hot gas relative to the dark matter is related to interaction @xcite . for dynamically - relaxed clusters ,",
    "the form of the equilibrium mass profile reflects closely the distribution of dark matter ( see * ? ? ? * ) which , unlike galaxies , does not suffer from halo compression by adiabatic contraction of cooled gas .",
    "the majority of baryons in clusters are in the form of hot , diffuse x - ray emitting gas , and represents only a minor fraction of the total lensing mass near the centers of clusters @xcite .    the predicted navarro - frenk - white profile ( hereafter , nfw ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) derived from simulations based on collisionless , cold ( non - relativistic ) dark matter has a continuously - declining logarithmic gradient @xmath13 towards the center of mass , much shallower than the isothermal case ( @xmath14 ) within the characteristic scale radius , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 for cluster - sized halos )",
    ". a useful index of the degree of concentration , @xmath17 , compares the virial radius , @xmath1 , to @xmath15 of the nfw profile , @xmath18 .",
    "this has been confirmed thoroughly with higher resolution simulations @xcite , with some intrinsic variation related to the individual assembly history of a cluster @xcite .",
    "gravitational lensing observations are underway to provide reliable and representative cluster mass profiles to test this since the first careful measurements showed that the nfw profile provides a good fit to the entire mass profile when weak and strong lensing are combined .",
    "other well studied clusters with similarly high quality data are also in good agreement providing strong support for the cdm scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly these studies reveal that although the dark matter is consistent with being cold , the predicted profile concentration of the standard @xmath11cdm model falls short of some lensing results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this observed tendency for higher proportion of mass to lie at smaller radius in projection is also indicated by the generally large einstein radii determined from strong lensing of well studied clusters @xcite finding a substantial discrepancy with the predictions despite careful accounting for potential selection biases inherent to lensing @xcite .",
    "these observations could suggest either substantial mass projected along the line of sight , perhaps in part due to halo triaxiality @xcite , or a large overconcentration of mass ; the latter could imply modification within the context of the cdm family of models .",
    "the abundance of massive clusters is very sensitive to the amplitude of the initial mass power spectrum @xcite representing the most massive objects to have collapsed under their own gravity , and confirmed by @xmath19-body simulations of hubble volumes @xcite .",
    "such calculations predict for example that the single most massive cluster to be found in the universe is expected to be with @xmath20 out to @xmath21 ( see figure 5 of * ? ? ?",

    "] at higher redshifts this comparison becomes more sensitive to the cosmological model , with an order of magnitude decline in the abundance of @xmath23 clusters at @xmath24 compared to the present @xcite .",
    "hence , the existence of such massive clusters like xmmuj2235 - 25 at @xmath25 @xcite , from lensing work , begins to motivate alternative ideas such as departures from gaussian initial density fluctuation spectrum , or higher levels of dark energy in the past @xcite , although some non - gaussian models can be ruled out by using the cosmic x - ray background measurements @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is the model - free determination of mass profiles allowed over a wide range of radius when the complementary effects of strong and weak lensing are combined @xcite . in practice , the quality of data required challenges with few facilities , which are able to generate data of sufficient precision to provide a significant detection of the weak lensing signal on an individual cluster basis .    in this paper",
    "we aim to pursue in greater depth the utility of massive clusters for defining highest - precision mass profiles by combining all lensing information available in the cluster regime .",
    "in particular , we shall make a full use of the magnification information , afforded by measuring spatial variations in the surface number density of faint background galaxies @xcite , which we show here is readily detectable in the high - quality images we have obtained for this purpose . in our earlier work , particularly on a1689 and cl0024 + 17 ,",
    "the magnification information determined from the background counts was used only as a consistency check of distortion measurements @xcite .",
    "recently , we have shown in @xcite how to overcome the intrinsic clustering of background galaxies , which otherwise perturbs locally the magnification signal , and how to combine the two independent weak - lensing data sets to improve the quality of two - dimensional mass reconstruction using regularized maximum - likelihood techniques . here",
    "we further explore new statistical methods designed to obtain an optimal combination of the complementary lens distortion and magnification effects .",
    "our aim here is to develop and apply techniques to a sample of five well - studied , high - mass clusters with @xmath26 , a1689 , a1703 , a370 , cl0024 + 17 , and rxj1347 - 11 , for examining the underlying mass profiles extracted from the combined weak - lensing data sets .",

    "hst_/acs observations , which we have shown overlap well with the outer subaru - based profiles and together are well described by a generalized navarro - frenk - white profile , except for the ongoing merger rxj1347 - 11 @xcite , with modest variations in the central cusp slope ( @xmath440 ) , perhaps related to the dynamical state of the cluster .",
    "these high - mass lensing clusters with large einstein radii appear to be centrally concentrated in projection , as found in several other well studied massive clusters from careful lensing work .",
    "an accurate characterization of the observed sample is crucial for any cluster - based cosmological tests .",
    "it has been suggested that clusters selected with giant arcs represent a highly biased population in the context of @xmath11cdm . for those clusters with large einstein radii ( say , @xmath447 ) ,",
    "a large statistical bias of about @xmath448 is derived from @xmath19-body simulations @xcite , representing the most triaxial cases .",
    "the mean level of mass concentration inferred from our weak lensing analysis is high , @xmath449 ( simply ignoring the mass and redshift dependencies ) , for our sample with @xmath450 , as compared to the @xmath11cdm predictions , @xmath451 , evaluated at the median redshift of our sample , @xmath452 .",
    "this represents an overall discrepancy of @xmath453 with respect to the predictions , without taking into account the effects of projection bias .",
    "this apparent discrepancy is also evident when the weak - lensing mass profiles are combined with the inner strong - lensing information from deep acs observations (   [ subsec : wl+sl ] ) .",
    "applying a bias correction of @xmath454 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the discrepancy in @xmath455 is reduced to the @xmath456 level .",
    "another possible source of systematic errors in the mass profile determination is the cluster off - centering effect (   [ subsec : lprof ] ) .",
    "the effect is essentially the smoothing of the central lensing signal ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which flattens the recovered convergence profile below the offset scale , and therefore reduces the derived mass concentration ( @xmath457 ) and cusp slope ( @xmath334 ) parameters . for our sample of clusters",
    ", we found a cluster centering offset of typically @xmath458 using our detailed strong - lensing models .",
    "this level of centering offset ( @xmath459kpc@xmath236 ) is much smaller than the estimated values for the inner characteristic radius of our clusters , @xmath460 , and hence may not significantly affect our concentration measurements .",
    "however , this could potentially lead to an underestimation of the central cusp slope @xmath334",
    ".    our results are consistent with previous lensing work which similarly detected a concentration excess in the lensing - based measurements for strong - lensing clusters @xcite .",
    "our findings could imply , for these clusters , either substantial mass projected along the line of sight , due in part to intrinsic halo triaxiality , or a higher - than - expected concentration of dark matter .",
    "nevertheless , the overall level of uncertainties may be too large to robustly test the cdm predictions with the present sample .",
    "the forthcoming space telescope cluster survey , clash , will provide a definitive derivation of mass profiles for a larger , lensing - unbiased sample of relaxed x - ray clusters ( @xmath461kev ) , combining high - resolution panchromatic space imaging with deep , wide - field subaru weak - lensing observations , for a definitive determination of the representative mass profile of massive clusters .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for a careful reading of the manuscript and and for providing invaluable comments .",

    "for the cluster magnification analysis , the masking effect due to bright cluster galaxies , bright foreground objects , and saturated objects has to be properly taken into account and corrected for @xcite . here",
    "we describe two different approaches for estimating the effect of masking in the magnification bias measurement .      in this method ( method a ) , we describe each masking object as an ellipse specified by its structure parameters , such as the size , axis ratio , and position angle .",
    "sextractor provides such useful estimates of object properties ( magnitude , size , axis ratio , position angle , and so on ) for calculating masking areas and the resulting correction . in practice , we account for the masking of observed sky by excluding a generous area @xmath462 around each masking object , where @xmath463 and @xmath464 are defined as @xmath465 times the major ( a_image ) and minor axes ( b_image ) computed from sextractor , corresponding roughly to the isophotal detection limit ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we then calculate the correction factor for this masking effect as a function of radius from the cluster center , and renormalize the number density accordingly .",
    "note that the actual choice of @xmath466 is insensitive to the resulting magnification measurement @xmath467 @xcite , as this effect will cancel out when taking a ratio of the local surface density @xmath468 to the unlensed mean number density @xmath115 ( see   5.5.3 of umetsu & broadhurst 2008 ) .",
    "however , this method is not suitable for estimating masking areas by saturated stars and stellar trails , which can not be described by simple ellipses . for this case",
    ", we manually place a rectangular region mask around each saturated object to exclude a proper area .",
    "this approach has been commonly adopted in previous studies of cluster magnification bias @xcite .    in the top panel of figure [ fig : mask ] , we show as an example the masked region in a1689 based on the subaru @xmath154-band photometry , as obtained using method a ( see also umetsu & broadhurst 2008 ) .",
    "the gray area shows bright masking objects ( @xmath469 ab mag ) , each described as an ellipse .",
    "the black rectangular regions are masked areas for saturated stars and bright stellar trails .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : fmask ] the level of mask area correction in a1689 as a function of radius from the cluster center .",
    "the masking area is negligible ( a few % ) at large radii , and increases up to @xmath470 of the sky close to the cluster center .",
    "typically , the level of masking correction is found to be sufficiently small ( @xmath471 ) , so that the uncertainty in the masking correction is of the second order , and hence negligible .",
    "here we describe an alternative method ( method b ) for the masking correction which we have developed in this work .",
    "this method has practical advantages in comparison to method a : that is , it is easy to implement and can be fully automated once the configuration of analysis parameters is tuned , especially useful for large scale sky surveys such as the subaru hsc survey .    in this approach ,",
    "we use a pixelized flag image to exclude masking regions , namely those connected pixels that belong to bright foreground objects , bright cluster galaxies , saturated stars , and stellar trails .",
    "this can be done using sextractor s check - image output with @xmath472 .",
    "we tune sextractor configuration s detection parameters in order to optimize the detection for a particular object size and brightness . in our analysis of subaru images , the per - pixel detection threshold above the local sky background is set to @xmath453 ( @xmath473 ) , and the minimum number of connected pixels above threshold is set to @xmath474 ( @xmath475 ) with @xmath476 sampling . the bottom panel of figure [ fig : mask ] shows the distribution of masked regions in a1689 as obtained using method b. figure [ fig : fmask ] compares the masking correction factor in a1689 obtained using methods a and b , shown as a function of radius from the cluster center . it is shown that the two methods give consistent results in terms of both shape and amplitude of the radial profile of the correction factor .",
    "in this appendix , we aim to derive a discrete expression for the mean interior convergence @xmath477 using the azimuthally - averaged convergence @xmath77 . in the continuous limit , the mean convergence @xmath478 interior to radius @xmath79 can be expressed in terms of @xmath77 as @xmath479 for a given set of @xmath129 annular radii @xmath480 @xmath481 , defining @xmath19 radial bands in the range @xmath482 , a discretized estimator for @xmath483 can be written in the following way : @xmath484 with @xmath485 and @xmath486 being the area - weighted center of the @xmath87th annulus defined by @xmath487 and @xmath488 ; in the continuous limit , we have @xmath489",
    "we derive expressions for the binned tangential distortion @xmath83 and magnification @xmath46 in terms of the binned convergence @xmath38 , using the following relations : @xmath490 where both the quantities depend on the mean convergence @xmath491 interior to the radius @xmath86 , which is the center of the @xmath87th radial band of @xmath88 $ ] ( see appendix [ appendix : avkappa ] ) . by assuming a constant density in each radial band and by noting that @xmath86 is the _",
    "median _ radius of the @xmath87th radial band , @xmath492 can be well approximated by @xmath493 where @xmath494 and @xmath495 can be computed using the formulae given in appendices [ appendix : avkappa ] and [ appendix : lprof ] .",
    "if we are to combine background samples of different populations ( @xmath463 and @xmath464 ) and different lensing depths @xmath229 , we should take into account population - to - population variations in the lensing depth , @xmath496 , which can be measured from deep multi - band imaging , such as the 30-band cosmos database @xcite .",
    "the tangential distortion @xmath497 for population ( @xmath464 ) can be expressed in terms of the convergence @xmath498 for population ( @xmath463 ) as @xmath499 similarly , the magnification @xmath500 for population ( @xmath464 ) can be expressed in terms of @xmath501 .",
    "in this supplemental material section , we compare observed tangential - distortion ( shear ) @xmath70 and count - depletion ( magnification ) @xmath468 radial profiles with their respective reconstructed profiles , taking a370 at @xmath502 ( figure [ fig : a370 ] ) and cl0024 + 17 at @xmath503 ( figure [ fig : cl0024 ] ) as examples .",
