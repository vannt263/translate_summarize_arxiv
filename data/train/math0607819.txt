    "in this note , we consider the multiplication map of a multigraded algebra and ask for its surjectivity properties on the homogeneous parts .",

    "we investigate the following problem : given @xmath12 , does there exist an @xmath13 such that for any @xmath14 the multiplication map defines a surjection @xmath15 we call a pair @xmath12 _ generating _ if it has this property .",

    "we provide combinatorial criteria for a pair to be generating , and in the second one , we give a geometric characterization for the case of a factorial algebra @xmath0 .    to present the first result , let us recall from  @xcite the concept of the git - fan associated to  @xmath0 .",

    "note that we allow here a fan to have cones containing lines .",

    "for the first case there are obvious examples , and for the latter we present the following one .",

    ", one needs to know the orbit cones .",
    "here comes a general recipe .",
    "let @xmath0 be given by homogeneous generators and relations , i.e. , we have a graded epimorphism @xmath46 \\to a$ ] and generators @xmath47 for its kernel .",
    "with @xmath48 , the orbit cones are @xmath49 , where",
    "@xmath50 satisfies @xmath51 so , finding the sets of weights generating an orbit cone , amounts to testing for radical ideal membership , which can be performed quite efficiently by appropriate computer algebra systems .",
    "for the polynomial ring @xmath52 $ ] , the property of being a generating pair can be formulated as follows in a purely combinatorial manner .",
    "let the grading arise from a linear map @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "then the weight cone @xmath27 is the @xmath55-image of the positive orthant @xmath56 , and for any integral @xmath24 , we have the polyhedron @xmath57 .",
    "a pair @xmath12 is generating if and only if there exists an @xmath13 such that for any @xmath14 one has @xmath58    in order to present the second result , we have to recall from  ( * ? ? ?",
    "2 ) some more facts concerning the git - fan . for any @xmath59 , we have an associated nonempty set of semistable points : @xmath60 we have @xmath61 if and only if the git - cone @xmath62 is a face of @xmath63 .",
    "in particular , @xmath12 define the same set of semistable points if and only if they belong to the relative interior of a common git - cone .",
    "each set of semistable points @xmath64 admits a good quotient @xmath65 for the action of @xmath66 .",
    "for @xmath61 , there is an induced projective morphism @xmath67 of the quotient spaces .",

    "moreover , we consider the ( open ) set @xmath71 of points having a generic orbit cone . for a factorial @xmath0 ,",
    "we then obtain the following characterization of the generating property for a pair @xmath34 in the relative interior @xmath72 of @xmath27 .",
    "[ mainb ] let @xmath6 , @xmath16 and @xmath0 be as in  [ maina ] .",

    "then , for any two @xmath75 belonging to a common git - cone , the following statements are equivalent .    1 .",
    "the pair @xmath34 is generating",
    "the variety @xmath76 is normal .    under slightly sharper conditions on the algebra @xmath0 as posed in theorem  [ mainb ]",
    ", one may view @xmath0 as the `` cox ring '' of certain varieties , see  @xcite .",
    "theorem  [ mainb ] then tells about surjectivity properties of the multiplication map for global sections of divisors .",
    "we would like to thank d.  timashev for fruitful discussions and the referee for careful reading and helpful comments .",
    "the setup is the same as in the first section . in particular",
    ", @xmath16 is a lattice , and @xmath0 is a finitely generated , integral algebra over an algebraically closed field @xmath6 .",
    "we consider again the corresponding affine variety @xmath18 , and the action of the torus @xmath17)$ ] on @xmath74 defined by the @xmath16-grading of @xmath0 .    in a first step ,",
    "we give a more algebraic characterization of the git - fan . for @xmath12",
    ", we will work in terms of the following subalgebras : @xmath77 clearly , @xmath78 is contained in @xmath79 .",
    "we call @xmath78 _ large _ in @xmath79 , if the ideals @xmath80 and @xmath81 generated by the homogeneous parts of strictly positive degree satisfy @xmath82        we begin with the equivalence of ( i ) and  ( ii ) .",
    "if  ( i ) holds , then every orbit cone @xmath87 containing @xmath88 must contain @xmath35 and @xmath89 as well .",
    "this gives @xmath90 conversely , if ( ii )  holds , then we see that @xmath63 and @xmath62 are faces of @xmath91 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath92",
    ".    for the equivalence of ( ii ) and ( iii ) note that for any @xmath93 the complement @xmath94 equals the zero set @xmath95 .",
    "thus , setting @xmath96 , we obtain @xmath97 the latter property holds if and only if the ideals generated by @xmath98 and @xmath99 have the same radical in @xmath0 .",
    "this holds if and only if they generate the same radical ideal in @xmath100 , which eventually is equivalent to @xmath78 being a large subalgebra of @xmath100 .",
    "this observation enables us to decide whether or not two weights @xmath34 belong to a common git - cone by just looking at @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath79 . as a consequence",
    ", we may produce examples of nontrivial affine varieties with simple variation of git - quotients .",
    "recall that a point @xmath103 in a set @xmath104 of semistable points is said to be _ stable _ , if its orbit @xmath105 is closed in @xmath64 and of maximal dimension .",
    "if the set @xmath64 consists of stable points , then the fibres of the quotient map @xmath65 are precisely the @xmath66-orbits of @xmath64 .",
    "let @xmath16 be a lattice , and let @xmath0 be an @xmath16-graded , finitely generated , integral @xmath6-algebra .",
    "given @xmath29 , consider the ( finitely generated ) algebra @xmath106 then the corresponding action of the torus @xmath107)$ ] on the affine variety @xmath108 has the following properties .    1",
    ".   the git - fan @xmath109 associated to @xmath110 is the fan of faces of the cone @xmath29 .",
    "the union @xmath111 of all @xmath66-orbits of maximal dimension is a set of semistable points , and every @xmath112 is stable .    to see  ( i ) , note first that @xmath109 subdivides @xmath113 .",
    "moreover , proposition  [ largesubalg ]  ( iii ) implies that two weights @xmath85 lie in a common cone of @xmath109 if and only if they lie in a common cone of @xmath28 .    for  ( ii ) , note that the dimension of an orbit cone @xmath87 equals that of the orbit @xmath114 .",
    "since @xmath115 is the only cone of maximal dimension , we obtain @xmath116 for any @xmath35 from the relative interior of @xmath30 . since all orbits in @xmath117 have the same dimension , each of them is closed in @xmath117 .            replacing @xmath35 with a large multiple",
    ", we may assume that @xmath101 is generated as an @xmath125-algebra by the component @xmath126 , and that for any @xmath127 the canonical maps @xmath128 are surjective , see  ( * ? ? ?",

    "note that then @xmath129 is an ample invertible sheaf on  @xmath130 .",
    "of course , we may arrange the same situation for @xmath89 and @xmath88 .",
    "on @xmath131 we have the ample invertible sheaves @xmath132 .",
    "we claim that the natural map @xmath133 is an isomorphism .",
    "indeed , using the projection formula , we obtain canonical isomorphisms @xmath134 we look a bit closer at @xmath135 . given an open subset @xmath136 , we denote by @xmath137 the restricted projection",
    ". then we have @xmath138 likewise , one obtains @xmath139 for any affine open set @xmath136 .",
    "consequently , we have a canonical isomorphism @xmath140 this in turn shows @xmath141 , and our claim follows .",

    "thus , the first assertion follows from proposition  [ largesubalg ] . to see the second one ,",
    "note that both , @xmath35 and @xmath150 , lie in the relative interior @xmath151 of the git - cone @xmath29 .",

    "since @xmath159 has a complement of codimension at least two in @xmath74 , the same must hold for the image of @xmath160 in @xmath123 .",
