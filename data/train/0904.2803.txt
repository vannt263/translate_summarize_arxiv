    "moment equations for relativistic radiation transfer have been derived in several literature ( lindquist 1966 ; anderson , spiegel 1972 ; hsieh , spiegel 1976 ; thorne 1981 ; thorne et al .",

    "a complete set of moment equations for relativistic flow is given by the projected , symmetric , trace - free formalism by thorne ( 1981 ) . since a moment expansion gives an infinite set of equations , one must truncate the expansion at the finite order by adopting a suitable closure assumption , in order to make the transfer problem tractable .",
    "when one truncate at the second order , for example , the eddington approximation ( [ p0e0 ] ) has been usually adopted as a closure relation .",
    "such radiation moment formalism is quite convenient , and it is a powerful tool for tackling problems of relativistic radiation hydrodynamics .",
    "however , its validity is never known unless fully angle - dependent radiation transfer equation is solved .",
    "actually , the pathological behavior in relativistic radiation moment equations has been pointed out and examined ( turolla , nobili 1988 ; nobili et al .",
    "1991 ; turolla et al .",
    "1995 ; dullemond 1999 ) .",
    "namely , the moment equations for radiation transfer in relativistically moving media can generally have singular ( critical ) points . as a result",
    ", solutions behave pathologically in regions of strong velocity gradients .",
    "the appearance of singularities is explained because we approximate the full transfer equations with a finite number of moments ( dullemond 1999 ) .",
    "for example , in the one - dimensional relativistic radiation flow using the eddington approximation ( [ p0e0 ] ) , where the moment equations are truncated at the second order , the singularity appears when the flow velocity becomes @xmath83 .",
    "hence , under the traditional eddington approximation , we can not obtain solutions accelerated beyond @xmath84 , altough there exists a decelerating solution ( fukue 2005 ) .",
    "as already discussed in the introduction , the invalidity of the eddington approximation in such a relativistic flow can be understood as follows . in adopting the eddington approximation ( [ p0e0 ] ) ,",
    "we assume that within the mean free path of photons the radiation field is _ isotropic _ in the comoving frame .",
    "however , in the relativistic regime , where the velocity gradient becomes large and there exist the doppler and aberration effects of photons , the isotropy of the radiation field may break down even in the comoving frame .",
    "roughly speaking , the photon mean - free path @xmath85 in the comoving frame is @xmath86 , where @xmath25 is the opacity measured in the comoving frame and @xmath20 is the proper density .",
    "when there exists a velocity gradient , @xmath87 , the velocity increase at the distance of @xmath85 is estimated as @xmath88 in order for the radiation fields to be isotropic in the comoving frame , this velocity increase should be sufficiently smaller than the speed of light .",
    "otherwise , the usual eddington approximation in the comoving frame would be violated .",
    "in addition , photons suffer from the doppler and aberration effects , which change the radiation fields in the comoving frame .",
    "in such a case , we should modify the closure relation in the case of subrelativistic to relativistic regimes , as in the case of optically thick to thin regimes .    in order to improve the situation we are confronted with , instead of the usual eddington approximation",
    ", we can adopt a _ variable eddington factor _ , which depends on the flow velocity @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and the velocity gradient @xmath11 as well as the optical depth @xmath1 ( fukue 2006 ; fukue , akizuki 2006a , b ; akizuki , fukue 2007 ; koizumi , umemura 2007 ) .",
    "that is , in one - dimensional flows the variable eddington factor @xmath12 is generally defined as @xmath89 where @xmath71 and @xmath73 are the radiation energy density and the radiation stress tensor in the comoving frame , respectively .",
    "the closure relation in the inertial frame for one - dimensional flows then becomes @xmath90 where @xmath5 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 are the radiation energy density , the radiative flux , and the radiation pressure in the inertial frame , respectively ( kato et al .",
    "1998 , 2008 ) .",
    "the function @xmath12 must reduce to 1/3 in the non - relativistic limit of @xmath93 or in the uniform flow of @xmath94 , whereas it would approach unity in the extremely relativistic limit of @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , in the sufficiently optically thick regime this function approaches 1/3 , while in the optically thin limit it reduces to an appropriate form determined by the geometry under the considerations . in the plane - parallel case , for instance , the variable eddinton factor in the optically thin limit",
    "is analytically derived as @xmath95 since @xmath96 in equation ( [ pef ] ) in the optically thin limit ( see also kato et al .",
    "2008 ; koizumi , umemura 2007 ) .    in these recent studies ( fukue 2006 ; fukue , akizuki 2006a , b ; akizuki , fukue 2007 ; koizumi , umemura 2007 ) , they considered mainly the dependence of the variable eddington factor on the flow velocity . under the discussion above , in this paper we consider the dependence of the variabel eddington factor on the velocity gradient , using the approach of the comoving observer s view point .    as a result ,",
    "for example , we derived the form of the relativistic variable eddington factor ( [ f_linear ] ) and ( [ f_linear2 ] ) , where the eddington factor slightly decreases for the subrelativsitic flow with the velocity gradient . in the extremely linear regime , the comoving radiation fields including @xmath97 and @xmath98 perpendicular to the flow , and @xmath99 ,",
    "are calculated as @xmath100 using these results , the eddington tensors become @xmath101 which satisfy the relation @xmath102 .",
    "thus , the eddington factor in the direction of the flow slightly decreases , whereas that in the direction perpendicular to the flow slightly increases due to the velocity gradient .",
    "since we have assumed that the emitted intensity is isotropic in the sufficiently optically thick regime , there is no aberration effect , and this result is due to the redshift effect , where the one - tau photo - oval is seen to expand for the comoving observer due to the velocity difference .",
    "in this paper , from the viewpoint of the comoving observer we have analytically examined the eddington factor in the relativistic flow accelerating in the vertical direction ; we have introduced the one - tau photo - oval observed by the comoving observer , and then calculated the comoving radiation fields and the eddington factor .",
    "we thus have shown that the eddington factor depends both on the flow _",
    "velocity _ and the _ velocity gradient _ in the relativistic regime .    under the present plane - parallel case",
    ", the velocity increase in the downstream direction causes the density decrease in the downstream direction ; this effect is essential for the shape of the one - tau photo - oval and vessel . in the spherical flow ,",
    "on the other hand , there exists a geometrical dilution effect , and the situation can be somewhat different .",
    "such a spherical case is another problem .    in this paper , in order to analytically examine the relativistic variable eddington factor and",
    "explicitly demonstrate its dependence on the velocity gradient , we restricted ourselves in the linear approximation , where the velocity can be expanded , and the velocity gradient is sufficiently small .",
    "however , the linear expansion of the velocity may not be inadequate when the velocity becomes large to be on the order of unity .",
    "hence , the present approximation would violate in the region of @xmath103 .",
    "we may examine such an extremely relativistic case under the same approach .",
    "moreover , in order to treat the problem in the simplest form , we only consider the sufficiently optically thick regime , where the one - tau photo - oval always exists . in the optically thin regime or in the large velocity gradient case , there may appear the photo - vessel , where the optical depth becomes less than unity in the downstream direction .",
    "we should examine these general cases in the future .    in the problem of line - driven winds with large velocity gradients , the sobolev approximation is often adopted ( e.g. , peraiah 2002 ; castor 2004 ) .",
    "the sobolev method was also extended to the relativistic regime ( e.g. , hutsemkers , surdej 1990 ; hutsemkers , surdej 1993 ; jeffery 1993 , 1995a , b ) .",
    "such a relativistic sobolev approximation is also local similar to the present case .",
    "however , it is not so simple to compare between the present continuum transfer case and the sobolev s line transfer one .",
    "whether the present approach can be applied to the line transfer case , or the comparison with the sobolev method is also the future work .",
    "although the present treatment is limited in the linear regime , we first examined the relativistic variable eddington factor in the relativistic radiative flow under the physical situations , and obtained its dependence on the velocity and the velocity gradient in the explicit form .",
    "the relativistic variable eddington factor for relativistic radiative flows discussed in the present paper is fundamentally important in various aspects of relativistic astrophysics with radiation transfer ; i.e. , black - hole accretion flows with supercritical accretion rates , relativistic jets and winds driven by luminous central objects , relativistic explosions including gamma - ray bursts , neutrino transfers in supernova explosions , and various events occured in the proto universe .",
