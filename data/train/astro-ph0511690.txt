    "rapidly rotating young pulsars such as the crab and vela pulsars emit high - energy @xmath0-rays and are among the brightest sources in the @xmath0-ray sky . in the pulsar magnetosphere ,",
    "electrons and/or positrons are accelerated above 10  tev . because the pulsar is an electric dynamo with an available potential drop , @xmath5 volt , where @xmath6 is the rotational period and @xmath7 is the time derivative of the rotational period in units of @xmath8 s / s ,",
    "theoretically , it is suggested that the pulsars utilize some fraction of @xmath9 to accelerate the particles .",
    "_ egret _ instrument observed @xmath0-ray emissions from 7 pulsars ( thompson et al .",
    "the observed modulation of light curves and spectral cut - off energy test the theoretical models ; e.g. , the polar cap accelerator model ( sturrock 1971 ; ruderman & sutherland 1975 ; scharlemann , arons & fawley 1978 ; daugherty & harding 1996 ) , the outer gap accelerator model ( cheng , ho & ruderman 1986a , b , hereafter chr86 ; romani 1996 ; zhang & cheng 1997 ; hirotani & shibata 1999a , b ) , and the inner annual gap accelerator model ( qiao et al . 2004 ) .",
    "all models predict the particle acceleration in a charge depletion region called the gap , in which the charge density differs from the goldreich - julian charge density , with an electric field parallel to the local magnetic field lines .",
    "the outer gap model has been successful in explaining the observed main features of the @xmath0-ray light curves , such as the two peaks in a period and the presence of the emissions between the peaks .",
    "first investigated electric structure of the outer gap . by solving the poisson equation for the vacuum gap",
    ", chr86 showed that the inner boundary of the vacuum gap locates close to the null charge surface of the goldreich - julian charge density , and concluded that the outer gap is lying above the last open lines and is extending between the null charge surface and the light cylinder , the axial distance of which is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the rotational angular frequency and @xmath12 the speed of light .",
    "the last open lines are defined by the magnetic field lines tangent to the light cylinder . with chr86 s vacuum gap geometry ,",
    "the two peaks in a period have been interpreted as an effect of aberration and time delay of the emitted photons ( romani & yadigaroglu 1995 , hereafter ry95 ; cheng , ruderman & zhang 2000 ) .",
    "ry95 also reproduced phase separation of the pulses in different photon energies from radio to @xmath0 .",
    "hirotani & shibata ( 1999a , b , hereafter hs99 ) have solved electrodynamics in the non - vacuum outer gap ( see also hirotani & shibata 2001a , b ) .",
    "although hs99 worked in only one dimension along the last open line , they first connected consistently the field - aligned electric field in the outer gap with the curvature radiation and pair creation processes .",
    "the model reproduced the @xmath2 phase - averaged spectra of the vela like pulsars .    with these successful works ,",
    "the outer gap has been considered as a promising acceleration model accounting for the high energy emissions of the pulsars .",
    "however , there are some problems in the previous works . for example",
    ", chr86 discussed the electrodynamical structure of the vacuum gap , although they assumed an exponential grow of the number density in the trans - field direction .",
    "such a large number of particles must partially screen the field - aligned electric field on the magnetic field lines , on which they flow .",
    "another problem is the one - dimensionality in the hs99 arguments .",
    "the one - dimensional model neglected important trans - field effects caused by the curvature of the field lines .",
    "the @xmath0-rays are emitted tangent to the local magnetic field lines , converts into pairs on different field lines , and as a result , makes a trans - field distribution of the current .",
    "it is obvious that the electrodynamics such as the strength of the field - aligned electric field is affected by the trans - field structures .",
    "furthermore , the one - dimensional electrodynamical model has used the trans - field thickness as a parameter to be determined by the observed flux ( takata , shibata & hirotani 2004a , hereafter paper1 ) .",
    "recently , the emission region extending to both the stellar surface and the light cylinder has been proposed to explain the presence of the observed outer - wing emissions and of the off - pulse emissions of the crab pulsar ( dyks & rudak 2003 ; dyks , harding & rudak 2004 ) .",
    "muslimov & harding ( 2004 ) proposed the _ slot gap _ accelerator model ( arons 1983 ) , which bases on the polar cap model , as an origin of the emission region by dyks & rudak ( 2003 ) . on the other hand",
    ", it has been suggested that the outer gap may have an elongated emission regions ( takata , shibata & hirotani 2004b , hereafter paper2 ) .",
    "thus , the origin of the @xmath0-ray emissions in the pulsar magnetosphere has not been conclusive up to now .    in paper2",
    ", we have solved the electrodynamics in the outer gap with a two - dimensional model in the meridional plane .",
    "we extended hs99 s one - dimensional model into two - dimensional one with the trans - field structure .",
    "this two - dimensional electrodynamical model links the one - dimensional electrodynamical outer gap model by hs99 and the three - dimensional geometrical outer gap model by ry95 .    in paper2",
    ", we showed that the cusp of the inner boundary is located at the position where the local charge density caused by the current is equal to the local goldreich - julian value .",
    "this implies that the inner boundary of the outer gap shifts toward stellar surface from the conventional null charge surface as the current increases . in paper2 ,",
    "the elongated gap was predicted by the cases of the particle injection at the outer boundary of the gap .",
    "thus , the outer gap indicates the acceleration region predicted by dyks & rudak ( 2003 ) .",
    "however , because the spectrum was not investigated in paper2 , it was not certain that what kind of gap structure reproduces the observed @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to calculate the @xmath0-ray spectrum using the two - dimensional electrodynamical model proposed in paper2 and to examine dependence of the spectrum on the current through the gap and the inclination angle between the rotational and magnetic axes .",
    "we can estimate flux as seen from the earth more correctly than the one - dimensional model , because we solve the gap structure in both longitudinal and trans - field directions .",
    "we discuss the particle acceleration in the pulsar magnetosphere , and constrain the model parameters in terms of the spectral cut - off energy and the flux . to compare with the observations , we relax the previous restrictions of the model such as    * the inclination angle is equal to zero ( i.e. aligned - rotator ) , * @xmath1-ray field of the pair creation is homogeneous in the magnetosphere , * all @xmath0-rays produced by the curvature process have critical energy .    in this paper , we calculate the pair creation process with inhomogeneous and anisotropic @xmath1-ray field and the curvature spectrum of the individual particles (   [ casmodel ] ) .",
    "we demonstrate that the calculated spectrum softens if one assumes a larger current through the gap .",
    "especially , the calculated spectrum sharply softens with the increasing the number of particles injected at the outer boundary of the outer gap . on the other hand ,",
    "we also demonstrate that an increase in the number of particles injected at the inner boundary or of the inclination angle moderately changes the calculated spectral hardness . using this dependence of the spectral hardness , therefore",
    ", we can investigate the current in the outer gap of the observed @xmath0-ray pulsars by comparing the model spectrum with the observed one .",
    "we apply the theory to the vela pulsar , and show the gap geometry , the current through the gap and the inclination angle ( @xmath13 ) in the vela magnetosphere .",
    "we show that the @xmath2 spectrum predicts a large inclination angle @xmath14 and only a few particle injections into the outer gap at the outer boundary .    in  [ beq ] , we present the basic equations describing the stationary outer gap structure . in   [ casmodel ]",
    ", we develop the previous pair creation cascade model in paper2 using the monte carlo method . in  [ results ] , we compare the results with the observation of the vela pulsar . in this paper ,",
    "the polarity is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the magnetic moment of the star .",
    "since we ignore the effects of ions , the results do not depend on the polarity .",
    "for solving a stationary structure of the outer gap , we treat the ideal conditions :    1 .",
    "the stationary condition ( @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the time and azimuth , respectively ) is satisfied , that is , there is no time variation of any quantities as seen in a co - rotating system , 2 .",
    "the star crust is a rigid rotating perfect conductor , 3 .",
    "the plasmas fill the pulsar magnetosphere , and the condition @xmath20 holds all the way along the field lines connecting the star and the outer gap accelerator .",
    "strictly speaking , the condition @xmath21 can not arise in the first place .",
    "we assume that a mechanism of the electric field screening works in the region between the stellar surface and the inner boundary of the outer gap . in   [ inpart ] , we discuss the dynamics outside the gap .    by neglecting the magnetic component by rotational effects and by the current",
    ", we assume the static dipole magnetic field . this static dipole structure will be a good approximation as long as the electrodynamics in the outer gap is discussed .",
    "in fact , the sweepback effect is important in the geometrical studies to produce the double peaks in the light curves ( cheng , ruderman & zhang 2000 ) .",
    "electrodynamical speaking , the magnetic field affects on the electrodynamics thorough the goldreich - julian charge density , that is , the magnetic component projected to the rotational axis .",
    "as compared with the static dipole field , the null charge surface of the goldreich - julian charge density on the last - open lines , and therefore the inner boundary of the outer gap for the rotating dipole field is located closer to the stellar surface about 10% of the light radius . with this small difference of the positions of the inner boundaries between two magnetic fields , the qualitative arguments on the electrodynamics in the outer gap",
    "will not be changed very much as long as the outer boundary of the gap is not located near the light cylinder . in the later sections , we will predict that the out boundary that is favored for the vela spectrum does not locate near the light cylinder ( fig.[allgap ] ) , while the outer boundary on the light cylinder has been assumed in the previous light curve models ( romani 1996 ; cheng , ruderman & zhang 2000 ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that even if the outer boundary is located inside of the light cylinder , the two peaks in the light curves are expected because the outward moving particles accelerated in the gap continue to emit the high energy photons outside the gap via the curvature process (   [ compari ] ) .      with the condition @xmath22 , the electric field",
    "can be written as ( shibata 1995 , mestel 1999 ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the non - corotational potential and @xmath25 is the unit vector along the rotation axis .",
    "the @xmath26-acceleration is indicated by the non - corotational part in equation ( [ geelec ] ) , @xmath27 .",
    "substituting equation ( [ geelec ] ) in @xmath28 gives the poisson equation , @xmath29 ,    \\label{poisson}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the space charge density , and @xmath31 is the goldreich - julian charge density , @xmath32 .",
    "\\label{rhogj}\\ ] ] to simplify the geometry , we assume that the gap dimension in the azimuthal direction is much larger than that in the meridional plane . neglecting variation in the azimuthal direction , we rewrite equation ( [ poisson ] ) as @xmath33 ,    \\label{basic1}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 represents ( @xmath35)-parts of the laplacian .    at the moment , let s rewrite down the poisson equation ( [ basic1 ] ) as @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the distance along the magnetic field and trans - field directions , respectively . near the boundaries of the gap or for a thick outer gap , in which typical gap width along the filed line is much larger than the typical trans - field thickness , the left hand side of equation ( [ simpoi ] ) is dominated by the first term .",
    "the accelerating electric field is determined by @xmath39 apart from the boundaries for the thin outer gap , on the other hand , the second term dominates in the left hand side of equation ( [ simpoi ] ) .",
    "hence , the accelerating electric field behaves such as ( chr86 ) @xmath40 where we ignore the trans - field dependence of the charge density , @xmath41 is the typical gap trans - field thickness , and @xmath42 and @xmath43 represent the lower and upper boundaries of the gap , respectively .",
    "we find that the magnitude of the gradient of the effective charge density ( @xmath44 ) along the field lines determines the strength of the field - aligned electric field for the thin gap geometry , although the magnitude of the effective charge density causes the field - aligned electric field for the thick gap geometry . in a real pulsar magnetosphere ,",
    "the thin gap or the thick gap will be controlled by the pair - creation mean free path .    to solve the poisson equation ( [ basic1 ] ) numerically ,",
    "we introduce an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system ( @xmath45 ) following the dipole field on the meridional plane as @xmath46 and @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the radial distance and the colatitude angle with respect to the rotational axis , respectively .",
    "the laplacian becomes @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "non - corotational electric field ( @xmath52 ) is given by @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the line elements along the field line and the perpendicular curved line , respectively .",
    "for the young pulsar such as the vela pulsar , the non - corotational drift motion of the charged particles due to the non - corotational electric field @xmath57 is negligibly small in comparison with the corotational motion ( paper2 ) . also ignoring the gyro - motion",
    ", we denote the velocity @xmath58 as @xmath59 where @xmath60 represents the longitudinal velocity . because the accelerated particles move at the speed of light , the longitudinal velocity in the meridional plane is to be @xmath61 , with which the particles migrate along the line of @xmath62 .    with @xmath22 ,",
    "the continuity equation yields    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the source term , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 denote the number density of outwardly and inwardly moving particles ( i.e. the positrons and the electrons ) , respectively .    to calculate the source term @xmath64",
    ", we adopt the pair creation process between background @xmath1-ray photons and the @xmath0-ray photons in the gap .",
    "the mean free path of a @xmath0-ray photon with energy @xmath67 is written as @xmath68 with @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the @xmath1-ray number density between energies @xmath71 and @xmath72 , @xmath73 is the collision angle between an @xmath1-ray photon and a @xmath0-ray photon , @xmath74 is the threshold @xmath1-ray energy for the pair creation , and @xmath75 is the pair creation cross - section , which is given by @xmath76 ,    \\label{cross}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the thomson cross section . in the latter sections , we apply the theory to the vela pulsar , for which the observed @xmath1-ray spectrum is dominated by thermal emission .",

    "we calculate the curvature radiation process of the accelerated particles .",

    "the lorentz factor in the gap is given by assuming that the particle s motion immediately saturates in the balance between the electric and the radiation reaction forces , @xmath102    as discussed in paper1 , the curvature emissions of the outwardly moving particles from outside the gap also contribute to the total emissions if the outer boundary of the gap is not located close to the light cylinder .",
    "outside the gap , the particles loose their energy via the curvature emissions so that @xmath103 we assume that the particles migrating on the magnetic field line labeled by @xmath104 escape from the gap with a lorentz factor given by the value at @xmath105 , which describes the condition that the gap crossing time @xmath106 of the particles is equal to the radiation damping time ( @xmath107 ) estimated by @xmath108 in the present paper , we take into account the curvature emissions up to @xmath109 .    the saturation ( [ gamma ] ) in the gap simplifies the problem significantly .",
    "the saturation motion of the particles will be achieved if the the typical acceleration length scale @xmath110  cm is shorter than the gap width @xmath111 ( see paper1 ) .",
    "for some part of the gap , where the electric field is week , the saturation approximation will break down ( hirotani , harding & shibata 2003 ) . in the two - dimensional model , specifically , around the lower and the upper boundaries , the condition @xmath112 is not satisfied effectively for all particles .",
    "nevertheless , we adopt the lorentz factor @xmath113 to all particles in the outer gap for simplicity , because the saturation breaks down within a few percent of the gap thickness measured from the upper and the lower boundaries and because the contributions of the emissions from such region are less important for the observed spectrum above 100mev .",
    "the high - energy particles also emit high - energy photons via the synchrotron process and the inverse - compton process . in   [ emipro ] , we show that the both emission processes will be less important for the gap electrodynamics in comparison to the curvature process",

    "the expected @xmath0-ray flux on the earth is given by @xmath203 where @xmath204 is solid angle of the @xmath0-ray beam and @xmath205 is the total photon number emitted per unit energy per unit time , @xmath206 where @xmath207 represents the total volume of the emission region , which includes both inside and outside the gap . in the present two - dimensional model , the solid angle of the @xmath0-ray beam",

    "the inner boundary shifts toward the stellar surface as the critical and/or external electron components increases .",
    "* as fig.[current ] shows , the present model predicts that more large current runs though the middle part of the gap rather than the upper part predicted in the chr86 arguments .",
    "the internal component @xmath199 increases with hight in the lower half part of the gap , and decreases in the upper half part .",
    "this decrease is because most @xmath0-rays emitted in the lower part of the gap escape from the inner boundary or the outer boundary before reaching the upper part .",
    "another reason is that the field - aligned electric field , the lorentz factor and in turn the emitted photon energy decrease with increasing hight in the upper half part .      in paper2 ,",
    "the trans - field thickness of the outer gap was not sensitive to the external component ( for example fig.6 in paper2 ) , because we assumed a homogeneous @xmath1-ray field .",

    "this difference in the thickness is explained in terms of the mean - free path depending on the radial distance and the emission direction , which were ignored in paper2 , as follows .",

    "as we expected , the inwardly propagating @xmath0-rays make many pairs around the inner boundary and the middle part of the gap .",
    "the large difference in the mean - free path between the outwardly and inwardly propagating @xmath0-rays is mainly attributed to difference in the collision angle @xmath73 with the surface x - ray photon .",
    "for example , the collision angle of the @xmath0-ray photon emitted from the conventional null point on the last open line of @xmath90@xmath4 becomes @xmath248@xmath4 for the outwardly propagating and becomes @xmath249@xmath4 for the inwardly propagating @xmath0-rays .",

    "this difference in the threshold energy and the resultant difference in the @xmath1-ray photon number for the collision mainly produce the large difference in the mean free path .",

    "we expect that the large positron component such as @xmath310 runs through in the gap .    for @xmath299 ,",
    "the adjusted azimuthal angle of @xmath314  radian for @xmath315 explains the observation very well .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath316 ( the solid line ) , the expected angle @xmath317  radian is also consistent with the observation .",
    "therefore , we find that both the observed spectral cut - off energy and flux are explained by @xmath318 for @xmath306@xmath4 .",
    "as we have seen , the upper limit @xmath315 for @xmath306@xmath4 is determined by the spectral cut - off energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the lower limit of the external positron @xmath190 is determined by a comparison between the model and the observed flux .",
    "because the expected flux depends on the three - dimensional geometry , we should use a three - dimensional model to give the lower limit of @xmath190 for @xmath299 .    in summary ,",
    "we have shown by solving the two - dimensional gap structure that the strength of the field - aligned electric field and the hardness of the produced @xmath0-ray spectrum are strongly affected by the current through the gap . by comparing the model spectrum with the @xmath2 observation",
    ", we have successfully constrained the model parameters ( the current and the inclination angle ) for the vela pulsar , as follows . only a few external electrons ( i.e. @xmath281 ) injected into the gap at the outer boundary are predicted by the @xmath2 observation .",
    "we also safely rule out any cases of @xmath319@xmath4 .",
    "with uncertainty due to the three dimensional effects , we conclude that the vela pulsar has the inclination angle @xmath197 greater than @xmath320 . with the moderate critical internal component @xmath282 , the positronic component @xmath190",
    "is restricted such as @xmath310 for @xmath297 and @xmath321 for @xmath299 .",
    "we can also explain the observed spectrum with greater inclination angles .",
    "following the ry95 arguments , the inclination angle will be not close to 90@xmath4 , because the radio pulsation of the vela pulsar shows a single peak .",
    "in this section , we show the validity of the assumption that the synchrotron and the inverse - compton process are less important for the gap electrodynamics , and calculate the inverse - compton spectrum to compare the result with the recent observation in tev range .",
    "[ emipro ]      pairs created by the pair creation process in the gap have significant pitch angle @xmath104 and will radiate the synchrotron photons .",
    "initial energy of the pairs is several gev , which is typically energy of the @xmath0-ray photons radiated by the curvature process of the accelerated particles .",
    "after the birth , the pairs are accelerated to @xmath322 from the initial lorentz factor of @xmath323 and will have pitch angle of @xmath324 .",
    "it follows that the ratio between the synchrotron power and the curvature power becomes @xmath325 this indicates that the synchrotron process is less important for the gap electrodynamics .",
    "however , it is not denied an another solution in which the synchrotron radiation play an important role .",
    "for example , as we have seen , for the large current case , the inner boundary is shifted toward stellar surface , where the synchrotron process would be important because the magnetic field strength significantly increases .",
    "the present model have predicted that the inner boundary of the gap that is favored for the vela spectrum does not locate near the stellar surface ( fig.[allgap ] ) .    the large number of pairs will be produced outside the gap .",
    "these pars radiate synchrotron photons , the typical energy of which is @xmath326 it is , therefore , entirely justified to neglect the synchrotron component emitted outside the gap when we considerer the @xmath0-ray spectrum above 100  mev .",
    "tev photons are emitted by the inverse compton ( ic ) scatterings of infrared ( ir ) photons off the relativistic electrons and positrons , which emit gev photons via the curvature process .",
    "for the vela pulsar , romani ( 1996 ) predicted the pulsed tev flux at about 1% of the pulsed gev flux , which has been ruled out by air cherenkov telescopes ( konopelko et al . 2005 ) .",
    "therefore , the theoretical prediction of tev flux is important for checking the validity of the model .",
    "we assume the ir field is isotropic and homogeneous , because the ir photons will be radiated by the synchrotron process of the pairs with a larger pith angle . for isotropic case , the relativistic particle upscatters the soft photons to produce the following spectrum ( blumenthal & gould 1970 ) @xmath327,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath328 , @xmath329 and @xmath330 . from ir",

    "this result is marginally consistent with the result by ry95 , in which @xmath339@xmath4 for the vela pulsar was predicted to explain the phase difference between the radio and @xmath0-ray pulses . ry95",
    "considered the gap having no external component ( @xmath233 ) and starting from the conventional null surface . however , the present model has predicted the particle injection at the inner boundary ( @xmath340 ) to explain the observed flux , although the obtained inner boundary is located near the conventional null surface ( fig.[allgap ] ) .",
    "ry95 have assumed that the gap is extending to the light cylinder to produce the first peak of the light curves . in this paper ,",
    "the gap geometry in fig.[allgap ] that is favored for matching the spectrum of the vela pulsar does not predict such long outer gap .",
    "however , we note that the accelerated particles in the outer gap emit the @xmath0-ray photons outside the gap . as fig.[spectra ] shows , the curvature photons emitted outside the gap by the outwardly moving particles also contribute to emissions above 100mev .",
    "specifically , the outwardly moving particles escape from the light cylinder with the lorentz factor @xmath341 , the corresponding curvature photon energy is @xmath342  mev , where @xmath343 is the averaged curvature radius of the field line , along which the particles move .",
    "therefore , although the outer boundary of the gap is located inside of the light cylinder , the high - energy photons are emitted near the light cylinder and the double peak structure in the calculated light curves is expected .",
    "the detail calculation will be done in the subsequent papers .",
    "dyks & rudak ( 2003 ) proposed the radiation emission region starting from near the stellar surface to explain the presence of the outer - wing emissions and of the off - pulse emissions of the crab pulsar . with the two - dimensional outer gap model",
    ", we found that such gap has a large particle injection at the outer boundary ( paper2 ) .",
    "for such cases , @xmath344 , however , the our model ( e.g. @xmath220  4 ) also predicts the softer spectrum than the observed one of the vela pulsar , as we discussed in   [ diagnosis ] .      as we have seen , the inner boundary , where @xmath238 , is located at the position where the local charge density caused by the current is equal to the goldreich - julian charge density , that is , @xmath345 is satisfied on the inner boundary .",
    "however , the condition @xmath346 is satisfied between the stellar surface and the inner boundary . this negative charge depletion from the goldreich - julian charge density",
    "predicts a field - aligned electric field between the stellar surface , on which @xmath186 is defined , and the inner boundary .",
    "in such a case , there is a potential drop along the magnetic field lines . in the present paper",
    ", however , we have imposed the condition ( [ cond1 ] ) , @xmath186 , at the inner boundary with the assumption that a screening mechanism of the electric field is working and that the potential drop between the stellar surface and the outer gap is much smaller than the potential drop in whole outer gap . in this subsection , therefore , we discuss the screening mechanism between the stellar surface and the inner boundary with the case that @xmath233 .",
    "firstly , as the particles that screen the electric field , we mention a population of the electrons trapped between the stellar surface and the outer gap , such as the electron clouds trapped between the stellar surface and the boundary of the outer magnetospheric gap appeared in smith , michel & thacker ( 2001 ) .",
    "these electrons stabilize the force free surface ( i.e. the inner boundary ) between the plasma side and the outer gap side .",
    "therefore , we expect that three kind of the particles will populate between the star and the inner boundary ; the primary particles accelerated in the gap , the pair particles produced outside gap by the inwardly @xmath0-rays and the trapped electrons .",
    "the vacuum outer gap model of chr86 also assumed these trapped electrons between the stellar surface and the traditional null charge surface .",
    "such trapped electrons will be distributed to fill the negative charge depletion , @xmath347 , from the goldreich - julian charge density , and to satisfy the condition @xmath238 between the stellar surface and the inner boundary .    because the inner boundary will be affected by the plasma condition around the gap , we consider a particular case that there are no trapped electrons as an another possibility",
    ", that is , only primary and pair particles are migrating toward the stellar surface along the magnetic field line linking the star and the outer gap . with the assumption that the screening distance along the field line is much smaller than the trans - field thickness , we take the field - aligned part in the poisson equation to obtain the field - aligned electric field . in this case , we can produce the solution that the field - aligned electric field @xmath180 undergoes spatial oscillation , and therefore is screened out by the small velocity difference of the pair particles . because the amplitude of the potential ( @xmath348 in the non - dimensional value ) is much smaller than the potential drop ( @xmath349 ) in the outer gap , the condition ( [ cond1 ] ) , @xmath186 , at the inner boundary is a good treatment .",
    "following shibata , miyazaki & takahara ( 2002 ) , however , we can show that a surprisingly large pair - creation rate is required to screen .",
    "in fact , the screening is achieved if the pairs were created with a rate @xmath350 where @xmath351 is the pair flux divided by @xmath352 , @xmath353 is the strength of the magnetic field at the inner boundary and @xmath354 is the initial lorentz factor of the pair .",
    "this rate indicates that the total number @xmath355 of the pairs produced within the typical screening distance @xmath356 cm is @xmath357 , where @xmath358 represents the typical goldreich - julian value .",
    "such a very large pair creation rate has not been predicted by the present cascade model , in which @xmath359  /cm ( fig.[map ] ) . on these ground",
    ", we expect that the pair polarization does not screen out the field - aligned electric field within the small distance along the field line .",
    "as discussed above , if no trapped electrons exist between the stellar surface and the outer gap , the field - aligned electric field will be caused outside the gap over a wide range along the field line .",
    "for such a case , the trans - field part in the poisson equation determines the non - corotational potential , and the field - aligned part is not important , so that @xmath360 , \\label{transeq}\\ ] ] where @xmath361 , @xmath362 and @xmath363 are , respectively , the charge densities of the par positrons and electrons , and @xmath364 is the distance in the trans - field direction . by ignoring the trans - field distribution of the charge density , the solution of equation ( [ transeq ] ) becomes @xmath365 \\xi_{\\perp } ( \\tilde{d}_{\\perp}-\\xi_{\\perp})/2 $ ] , where we use the boundary conditions that @xmath186 at @xmath366 and @xmath367 , where @xmath368 represents the trans - field thickness .",
    "the field - aligned electric field is @xmath369 where @xmath370 is the field - aligned distance increasing toward the star .",
    "let us consider the sign of the field - aligned electric field of equation ( [ twoelectric ] ) .",
    "if we ignore the contribution of the pair particles on the electric field , we find that the electric field becomes a positive because the outer gap is located on the field lines that curve away from the rotational axis and because the derivative @xmath371 has a positive value between the stellar surface and the inner boundary .",
    "this positive electric field accelerates the pair electrons and decelerates the pair positrons , which are migrating toward the star .",
    "the continuity equations of the pair particles predict the field - aligned distribution of the charge density increasing toward the stellar surface , that is @xmath372 .",
    "the derivative of the total charge density in the right hand side of equation ( [ twoelectric ] ) has positive value , and therefore the effect of the pair polarization strengthens the positive electric field , which will appear unless there are such pair particles .",
    "although some positrons are returned and are accelerated toward the gap by the positive electric field , the positive electric field will be held between the stellar surface and the inner boundary even if the effect of the discharge of the pairs is taken into account , as has been indicated by hirotani ( 2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "recently , hirotani ( 2005 ) has solved the structure of the particular outer gap with the particle motion by setting the inner boundary at the stellar surface .",
    "he has indicated that such outer gap is composed of two region ; one region ( called `` minor part '' ) takes on a minor part of the potential drop of whole outer gap and has a small positive field - aligned electric field , and other ( called `` major part '' ) takes on a major part of the potential drop and has a large field - aligned electric field .",
    "the major part , which corresponds to so - called outer gap in the present paper , is located in the outer magnetosphere and the minor part is extending between the stellar surface and the major part . because the potential drop in the minor part of the gap is negligibly small in comparison with that in the major part , the boundary condition ( [ cond1 ] ) , @xmath373 ( [ cond1 ] ) , at the inner boundary of the major gap will be a good treatment as long as we are concerned with the major part of the gap .    with above discussions , therefore ,",
    "we conclude that the boundary condition that @xmath186 at the inner boundary , where @xmath238 , for the outer gap is a good treatment .",
    "= ( 0.1,0 ) and @xmath312@xmath4 .",
    "each panel is same with fig.[gapcom ] .",
    "the solid lines show the results of the gap having the outer boundary located near the light cylinder at the lower part .",
    "the dashed lines show the results of the gap having the outer boundary of @xmath374 , width=453,height=302 ]    as we have seen , the outer gap structure and produced @xmath0-ray spectrum are controlled by the current , which circulates in the magnetosphere globally . by comparing the observation , our local model can constrain the current flow pattern in the gap and the inclination angle , which can not be observed directly . for further discussions , we would need a connection between the global and local models , as follows .    in the previous sections",
    ", we had considered the outer boundary following a curve line perpendicular to the magnetic field lines , that is @xmath375constant .",
    "it is notable that the shape of the outer boundary is controlled by the trans - field distribution of the total current .    around the lower boundary ,",
    "only a few pairs are produced by the pair creation , because the @xmath0-rays are always emitted to the convex side of the magnetic field lines .",
    "therefore , the shape of the outer boundary can become such as the gap structure displayed with solid lines in fig.[speccom ] , of which the outer boundary changes from @xmath376 to @xmath377 in region within 16% of gap thickness measured from the lower boundary . for comparison",
    ", we show the gap structure ( dotted line ) having the outer boundary of @xmath376 .",
    "the electrons produced in the extending region emit the inwardly propagating @xmath0-rays to convex side of the magnetic field lines and make pairs around the inner boundary . in the upper left panel of fig.[speccom ] , we can see that an effect of these new born pairs is the increase of the internal current around the hight @xmath378 measured from the lower boundary .",
    "fig.[speccom ] .",
    "the difference between the two currents produces the difference between the outer boundaries in the upper right panel .",
    "we find in fig.[speccom ] that the calculated spectra for both cases are consistent with the observation .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to deduce the shape of the outer boundary using the present local model . as a global study",
    ", chr86 postulated that the outer gap is extending until the light cylinder , such as the gap geometry depicted with the solid line in fig.[speccom ] , due to the presence of an ionic ( or a positronic ) particle outflow from the light cylinder .",
    "for the aligned - rotator , on the other hand , mestel et al .",
    "( 1987 ) studied a structure of the magnetosphere with a global current and an acceleration region , which closes within the light cylinder ( see also mestel 1999 ) .",
    "these global studies solve the global current , which interacts with the polar cap , the outer gap and the pulsar wind .    because the local model can predict the current through the gap with the observations as we have seen in the present paper , and because the global study can solve the global current flow in the magnetosphere",
    ", the combination between the local and global studies would give a consistent understanding of the structure of the active pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "for such a discussion , a three - dimensional electrodynamical model is needed to compare with the observed phase - resolved spectra and light curves .",
