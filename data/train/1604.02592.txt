    "for instance , the va - predicted minimum norm , given by eq .",

    "the scheme is implicit , its realization implying iterations for the calculation of values in each temporal layer , but it allows running computation with larger temporal steps . in order to reveal instability (",

    "the ds is stable for the values of omega corresponding to the slope of the @xmath226 curve situated left to the minimum point @xmath227 and transforms into fs at the slope right to this point .",
    "the border between the stability and instability regions in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ pic : n(omega ) ] is fuzzy . within this `` fuzzy area ''",
    "the evolution of initial ds profile strongly depends on the type of imposed perturbation and parameters of the numerical method .",
    "the mathematical issue considered in this work is the classification of families of solitons and their bound states in the model of the nonlinear lattice , which is represented by the periodically varying nonlinearity coefficient .",
    "a condition necessary for the existence of the infinite variety of the bound states is that the local coefficient must assume both positive and negative values .",
    "then , the analysis is performed for the physically relevant problem , which may find direct applications to bose - einstein condensates and planar waveguides in nonlinear optics : finding two branches of the dss ( _ dipole solitons _ ) , whose antisymmetric profile is confined , essentially , to a single cell of the nonlinear lattice .",
    "the shape of these solitons is very similar to that of the _ subfundamental solitons _ , which are known in models with usual linear lattice potentials , where they are chiefly unstable .",
    "an essential finding reported here is that one of two branches of the single - cell ds , family which satisfies the vk ( vakhitov - kolokolov ) criterion , is _ completely stable_.",
    "also it was found that dss belonging to the unstable branch evolve into stable fss .",
    "these results were obtained by means of numerical methods and also , in a qualitatively correct form , with the help of the va ( variational approximation ) . besides that , it was found that particular species of fs bound states are stable too .",
