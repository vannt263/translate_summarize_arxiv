    "the study of the entanglement in quantum many - body systems has lead to new insights into the structure of strongly correlated quantum states",
    ". one interesting direction of current research in this respect is the identification of universal contributions to the scaling of the bipartite entanglement entropy in quantum many - body systems . for the special case of one - dimensional quantum critical states , described by a conformal field theory ,",
    "it is well known , for example , that the entanglement entropy @xmath6 asymptotically scales as @xmath7 with the subregion size @xmath8  @xcite . here , the central charge @xmath9 provides a universal number , which furthermore also relates to the number of degrees of freedom , e.g. , for bosonic free theories . for higher - dimensional quantum systems , similar universal contributions to the entanglement entropy scaling require one to consider corrections beyond the leading scaling form , which in most generic cases is set by the `` area - law '' scaling of the entanglement entropy @xmath6 with the size of the boundary that separates a subregion from the rest of the system  @xcite . for two - dimensional systems , on which we shall focus here",
    ", this leading asymptotic behavior reads @xmath10 , in terms of the length @xmath8 of the subregion s boundary , with a non - universal area - law prefactor @xmath11 that depends explicitly on microscopic details of the system under consideration .",
    "several distinct contributions to the subleading scaling of @xmath6 with @xmath8 have been considered recently , related , e.g. , to topological order  @xcite or the presence of goldstone modes  @xcite . here , we consider in particular the case of a quantum critical many - body system . for this case",
    ", a growing body of evidence has been obtained from both numerical studies of various quantum many - body lattice models , as well as field - theoretical calculations in the continuum limit , that an isolated corner in the subregion boundary adds a logarithmic contribution , i.e. , a term @xmath12 , to the bipartite entanglement entropy  @xcite . in order to obtain a lattice regularized version of such corner terms without introducing further lattice artifacts , boundaries with @xmath13 corners",
    "may be most conveniently considered in numerical studies on finite square lattices . on a more quantitative level , these calculations provide strong evidence that the prefactor @xmath14 for a corner with an opening angle @xmath15 scales to a high precision at least in leading order proportional to the number of field components @xmath16 of the critical o(@xmath16 ) theory , with a prefactor that appears to be a universal function of @xmath15 for all critical @xmath0-theory cases considered thus far .     within the quantum critical region of the bilayer ( top panel ) and",
    "the necklace ( lower panel ) mode .",
    "the insets show the rescaled transverse staggered spin structure factor as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "dashed lines indicate the quantum critical points .",
    "error bars in this figure are below the symbol size.,title=\"fig : \" ]   within the quantum critical region of the bilayer ( top panel ) and the necklace ( lower panel ) mode .",
    "the insets show the rescaled transverse staggered spin structure factor as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "dashed lines indicate the quantum critical points .",
    "error bars in this figure are below the symbol size.,title=\"fig : \" ]    while for the cases of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , support for this observation has been provided by series and numerical linked cluster expansions , as well as by quantum monte carlo simulations ,  @xcite the case of @xmath20 still needs to be addressed by quantum monte carlo studies . here , we complement recent results from series expansion and numerical linked - cluster studies  @xcite on several two - dimensional lattice models with o(2 ) symmetry by a quantum monte carlo estimate of the @xmath13 corner term .",
    "in particular , we consider the case of the quantum critical spin - half xy model on the square - lattice bilayer , which provides a basic model for probing the entanglement properties at a quantum critical point with an @xmath21 critical theory . for this model",
    ", we provide estimates for both the leading area - law prefactor @xmath11 as well as the corner term @xmath22 , based on the second ( @xmath23 ) rnyi  @xcite entropy - based bipartite entanglement measure @xmath24,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 denotes the reduced density matrix of the subregion ( denoted @xmath26 ) .",
    "in addition , we also consider the quantum critical spin - half xy model a the square necklace lattice ( or incomplete bilayer ) , which , in contrast to the bilayer model , has a finite spin exchange interaction within only one of the two layers .",
    "we introduce both these models and locate their quantum critical points based directly on their magnetic properties in sec .",
    "this also allows us to confirm the expected critical exponents from a finite - size scaling analysis . in sec .",
    "iii , we then present our computational scheme and extract the entanglement entropy scaling coefficients for @xmath27 for both these models .",
    "these values are finally discussed in comparison to previous results in sec .",
    "in the following , we consider the spin - half xy model on a square - lattice bilayer , described by the hamiltonian @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the @xmath29th unit cell containing two spin - half degrees of freedom ( associated to the two layers , @xmath30 ) , and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) the intralayer ( inter - layer ) exchange interaction .    in addition",
    ", we consider the spin - half xy model on a square necklace lattice ( or incomplete bilayer ) , described by the hamiltonian @xmath33 in which the inter - layer coupling has been turned to zero in one of the layers .",
    "this corresponds to a square - lattice spin system with a local impurity spin attached to each lattice site , i.e. , a kondo necklacelike model with xy exchange interactions .",
    "the su(2)-symmetric version of this model has been considered previously using quantum monte carlo methods , both with respect to ground state properties  @xcite and at finite temperatures  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we denote by @xmath34 the ratio of the interlayer to the intralayer exchange interactions for both models considered here .",
    "both models exhibit a quantum phase transition at a critical coupling ratio @xmath35 between a low-@xmath17 phase with long - range transverse antiferromagnetic order to a large-@xmath17 quantum disordered phase .",
    "the structure factor corresponding to the order parameter for this transition is given in terms of the transverse spin correlations as @xmath36 here , the summations are performed over all spins on the finite lattice , where @xmath37 , depending on the sublattice to which spin @xmath29 belongs on the bipartite lattices .",
    "we consider , in particular , finite lattices of linear extent @xmath38 , containing @xmath39 spins , employing periodic boundary conditions in both lattice directions . for @xmath40",
    ", @xmath41 extrapolates to a finite value in the thermodynamic limit . in ref .",
    ", an estimate of @xmath42 was obtained for the bilayer model from quantum monte carlo simulations combined with a finite - size scaling analysis of the spin stiffness @xmath43 , employing the fact that at the quantum critical point , @xmath43 scales linearly with @xmath38 , reflecting a dynamical critical exponent @xmath44 . here",
    ", we confirm this value of @xmath45 from calculations of the structure factor @xmath46 , which allows us to verify explicitly also that the quantum critical behavior is indeed in accord with the expected three - dimensional @xmath21 universality class .",
    "for this purpose , we performed quantum monte carlo simulations employing the stochastic series expansion approach  @xcite for finite lattices with periodic boundary conditions , scaling the inverse temperature @xmath47 with linear system size in order to probe ground state correlations . near the quantum critical point , the finite - size data exhibit conventional finite - size scaling behavior , @xmath48 with a scaling function @xmath49 and critical exponents @xmath50 and @xmath51 , that for the three - dimensional @xmath21 universality class take on the values @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively  @xcite . when performing simulations within the critical region , the above scaling form implies a common crossing point of the various finite - size values of the rescaled structure factor @xmath54 at the quantum critical point , i.e. , for @xmath35 .",
    "this fact allows us to locate the quantum critical point as shown in the upper inset of fig .  1 .",
    "we obtain a value of @xmath42 , in agreement with the previous estimate , based on the spin stiffness  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the finite - size data exhibit an excellent data collapse , confirming again the extracted value of @xmath45 as well as the employed critical exponents of the three - dimensional @xmath21 universality class ( cf .",
    "the main upper panel of fig .  1 ) .",
    "we are not aware of previous estimates of the location of the quantum critical point for the xy necklace model , and thus performed a similar finite - size analysis as for the xy bilayer model , with the resulting data collapse and crossing plots shown in the lower panel of fig .  1 .",
    "from our analysis , we obtain as estimate of @xmath55 for the xy necklace model , and again find excellent accord of the numerical data with the anticipated three - dimensional @xmath21 universality class .",
    "after having established the value of the quantum critical coupling ratios and confirming the three - dimensional @xmath21 universality class of the quantum phase transitions on both lattice geometries , we next performed quantum monte carlo simulations to extract the scaling properties of the second rnyi entropy @xmath27 at these quantum critical points . in order to separate the logarithmic contribution arising from the corners in the subregion boundary , we considered in each case two differently shaped subregion types , similarly to our procedure for the su(2)-symmetric heisenberg bilayer case  @xcite .",
    "first , we consider a bipartition of the toroidal simulation cell into two equally sized cylindrical strips , both of size @xmath56 .",
    "the circumference of the subregion boundary in this case equals @xmath57 . the striplike subregions exhibit smooth boundaries without any corners . in order to introduce corners into the finite discrete - lattice subregion boundary in a controlled , scalable way , we considered in addition the case of a square subregion of size @xmath58 , this way introducing four @xmath3 corners along the subregion boundary . upon increasing the linear system size @xmath38 , we thus scaled the subregion size in both cases such that the aspect ratio remained at a constant value .",
    "any contribution to @xmath27 that depends only on the aspect ratio thus reduces for both considered subregions to a @xmath8-independent , constant term .",
    "we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of various proposed functional forms of such aspect ratio contributions to the entanglement entropy . for both subregion types , we then calculated @xmath27 for various boundary lengths @xmath8 , employing the extended ensemble sampling approach , based on the replica trick  @xcite within the stochastic series expansion quantum monte carlo representation of ref  .",
    "we furthermore used the `` increment trick ''  @xcite to successively obtain the entanglement entropy upon growing the subregion for an efficient sampling .     as a function of the subregion boundary length @xmath8 at the critical coupling ratio @xmath35 for strip and square shaped subregions",
    "the inset shows the residuals to a linear fit @xmath59 of @xmath60 for strip ( st ) shaped subregions boundary length @xmath8 . ]",
    "the results for the boundary length dependence of the entanglement entropy @xmath27 at the quantum critical point for both subregion types are shown in fig .  2 for both the bilayer and the necklace lattice .",
    "we find that in both cases , @xmath27 exhibits a dominant area - law scaling .",
    "we first considered the case of the xy bilayer model , for which we considered system sizes from @xmath61 to @xmath62 , corresponding to boundary lenghs between @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "as shown in the insets of fig .  2 , the strip subregion data is well accounted for by the area - law . from fitting the finite - size data for the strip subregions to a linear scaling form , we obtain an area - law scaling coefficient of @xmath65 for the bilayer model .",
    "one notices also that the statistical uncertainty in our numerical data increases with increasing subregion size .",
    "this is due to the propagation of errors while employing the incremental procedure to access larger subregion sizes .",
    "we thus concentrated our computational resources towards the lower four system sizes , where accurate results for @xmath27 are more readily accessible .",
    "therefore , for the necklace model systems we considered sizes from @xmath61 to @xmath66 , corresponding to @xmath63 and @xmath67 , respectively . in our simulations we found it not feasible to extent the considered system sizes to larger values of @xmath38 , due to enhanced statistical uncertainties for the necklace model , presumably due to the lower values of the critical coupling strength @xmath45 in that model . from fitting the finite - size data for the strip subregions to a linear scaling from , we obtain @xmath68 for the quantum critical necklace model . while this is not significantly different from the above quoted value for the quantum critial bilayer model , no universal meaning is associated to the area - law prefactor , as it depends on microscopic details .     for square ( sq ) and strip ( st ) subregions as a function of the subregion boundary length @xmath8 ( shown on a log - linear scale ) at the critical coupling ratio @xmath35 , along with the best fit line ( dashed line ) .",
    "]    for square subregions , we expect , in addition to the leading area law a logarithmic contribution to the entanglement scaling , due to the presence of the four corners along the subregion boundary . however , based on the finite - size data accessible to our numerical study , it is not feasible to reliably extract this logarithmic contribution from a direct fit to the square subregion data .",
    "in fact , we found that for square subregions on the restricted available @xmath8-range , the @xmath27 data may be fit within the statistical uncertainty also to a linear @xmath8-scaling . in order to estimate therefore the prefactor of the logarithmic term due to the presence of the four corners in the square subregion , we instead followed the procedure from ref .  , and considered directly the difference @xmath69 between the second rnyi entropies for the square ( sq ) and strip ( st ) subregions .",
    "this quantity is directly accessible within the quantum monte carlo simulations , using the fact that @xmath70}/{z^2 } ) + \\ln ( z[a^\\mathrm{st},2,t]/{z^2 } ) = -\\ln ( { z[a^\\mathrm{sq},2,t]}/{z[a^\\mathrm{st},2,t]})$ ] , where @xmath71 denotes the thermal partition function of the total lattice system , and @xmath72 $ ] the replica - trick ensemble partition function  @xcite for subregions @xmath73 or @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "our data for @xmath75 for both the bilayer and necklace models are shown in fig .  3 as a function of @xmath76 for the lower four system sizes .",
    "while the data still exhibit statistical uncertainties , they fit well for both models to a linear dependence @xmath77 .",
    "the resulting value of @xmath78 for the bilayer model implies a contribution to the logarithmic entanglement scaling of @xmath27 of @xmath79 for each @xmath80 corner for the bilayer model , while for the necklace lattice model we obtain values of @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "both values of @xmath83 compare rather well to each other , in accord with the expectation that the corner contribution to the entanglement scaling exhibits a universal character .",
    "it should be noted that the above error bars on the fitting parameters account for the statistical uncertainties in our quantum monte carlo data , but do not reflect possible systematic deviations due to further subleading finite - size corrections in the @xmath8-scaling of the entanglement entropy ( cf .",
    "also our previous discussion in ref .  ) .",
    "based on quantum monte carlo calculations of the transverse spin correlations , we identified the quantum critical points of the spin - half xy model on the square - lattice bilayer and necklace lattice .",
    "our result for the critical coupling ratio for the bilayer model agrees with a previous estimate based on the spin stiffness , and furthermore exhibits finite - size scaling in accord with a three - dimensional o(2 ) critical @xmath0-theory universality class , as does our finite - size data for the necklace model . at the quantum critical points",
    ", we extracted the scaling prefactors of the dominant area law in the second rnyi bipartite entanglement entropy , as well as an additional logarithmic term from @xmath80 corners in the subregion boundary , with consistent values for the two different models .",
    "our results for the scaling prefactor furthermore compare well to a recent estimate of @xmath84 from numerical linked - cluster calculations  @xcite , obtained for various two - dimensional o(2 ) quantum critical spin systems .",
    "they are also consistent within the statistical uncertainty with the values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 , reported from series expansions  @xcite . given that the employed computational approaches access this contribution through a rather different analysis [ finite systems ( here ) vs. thermodynamic - limit linked - cluster calculations ] , we consider our results to add further support for a possible universal character of such corner terms in the bipartite entanglement measure .",
    "for the future , it will be important to apply similar methods also to quantum phase transitions that reside outside the conventional @xmath0-theory framework , e.g. the xy@xmath87 universality class  @xcite , accessible in specifically designed quantum many - body systems  @xcite .",
