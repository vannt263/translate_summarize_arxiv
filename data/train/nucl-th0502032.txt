    "exotic ( halo ) nuclei are currently a subject of intensive experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "the interest in neutron - rich nuclei is to a large extent driven by experimental facilities and new experimental methods for studying the nuclear matter distribution . in particular , the ion trap method @xcite and the nmr ( nuclear magnetic resonance ) methods @xcite allow the measurements of the hyperfine splitting of electronic states in atoms with an accuracy of the order @xmath4 , that provides the possibility of hyperfine anomaly studies .",
    "the hyperfine splitting is sensitive to the magnetic current in the nucleus , and the hyperfine structure ( hfs ) constants extracted from the experimental data are related to the matter distribution of the nucleus .",
    "therefore , the measurements of the hfs anomaly in neutron - rich halo nuclei can give a unique way to investigate the neutron distribution and the cluster structure .",
    "for the experimental values of the magnetic moment of the be isotopes , we refer to the measurements in refs . @xcite .",
    "but still there are no experimental data on the hyperfine anomaly for these nuclei",
    ".    a theoretical study has been performed by fujita _",
    "@xcite in order to verify how the halo structure manifests itself in the hyperfine structure .",
    "they calculated the hfs anomaly for be isotopes both in the core+neutron model and in the single particle model , where the magnetic moment is well reproduced .",
    "they found that the hfs anomaly for @xmath3be is large compared to that for the @xmath5be isotopes , and that this was indicative of an extended neutron distribution and a halo structure in @xmath3be .",
    "however , the approach used by fujita _",
    "@xcite suffered from a poor knowledge of the ground state wave function of the @xmath2be isotopes .",
    "the value of the hfs anomaly @xmath6 defined by the folding of the electronic and nuclear wave functions is rather sensitive to the spatial distribution of the valence neutron wave function and to the weights of the possible mixed states in the description of the ground state wave function . during the last decade",
    "new information on the @xmath3be ground state wave function became available from the cross section measurements in the @xmath7(@xmath3be,@xmath8be)@xmath9 reaction and the weight of the 2s@xmath10 state admixture was found at the value 0.84 @xcite which is close to the theoretical estimation .",
    "besides this , the cluster ( core+neutron ) model while being rather good for the @xmath3be nucleus , might fail for @xmath11be , which has essentially a three - cluster ( @xmath12 ) structure @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there is no strong evidence for the three - body structure of @xmath13be in its ground state .",
    "so this is another interesting problem which can also be investigated in hfs anomaly studies .",
    "the @xmath3be @xmath14 ground state can be represented by an admixture of the 2s@xmath10 and 1d@xmath15 valence neutron states , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the weight of the @xmath18- state , related to the spectroscopic factor of this configurations obtained in both the shell model and the simple excited core cluster model , are found between 0.5 and 0.8 ( for more information on the spectroscopic factors we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in our calculations",
    "we take the weights of the states @xmath19 and @xmath20 , consistent with the experimental data @xcite ( for more details , see @xcite ) .",
    "let us mention that in ref .",
    "@xcite the hfs anomaly has been calculated within the bohr - weisskopf approach , where the electronic wave function is found for the interior of the nucleus .",
    "it is not applicable to the @xmath3be nucleus , where a significant part ( 88% ) of the valence nucleon wave function is outside of the range of nuclear potential , indicating a halo @xcite .",
    "in particular , the @xmath8be core root mean square ( rms ) radius 2.61 fm is rather small compared to the mean core - neutron distance ( 6 fm ) .",
    "thus , in ref .",
    "@xcite a rather simplified electronic wave function is used which significantly differs from the direct numerical solution of the dirac equation in the region @xmath21 fm .",
    "besides this , in calculations of the electronic wave function , the electron screening effects of the coulomb potential were not taken into account , although this effect can also be essential in the calculations of the hfs anomaly .    in the present paper ,",
    "the relativistic electronic wave functions are calculated for the extended nuclear charge density distribution defined by the cluster structure of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "we assume that two electrons in the @xmath22 state form the closed shell and are relatively unperturbed by the third electron in the @xmath23 state , and we define the wave function of this third electron as a solution of the dirac equation for a nuclear charge potential screened by the @xmath24 electronic closed shell @xcite .",
    "we compare our electronic wave function with that of fujita _ et al .",
    "we analyze the hfs of @xmath2be with regard to the available experimental information using more realistic descriptions of both the nuclear and the electronic wave functions .",
    "the aim of this paper is to answer the questions whether the hfs anomaly in these isotopes reflects the halo structure , and whether the hfs anomaly for @xmath3be isotope is larger than for @xmath11be .",
    "the magnetic hyperfine interaction hamiltonian is defined by @xmath25 here , @xmath26 is the nuclear current density , @xmath27 is the vector potential created by the atomic electrons @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the electron current density operator @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the dirac matrix for relativistic electrons .    for a @xmath32-electron system , the hyperfine interaction hamiltonian can be defined as @xmath33    with the neumann expansion of @xmath34 in equation ( [ ham1 ] ) , the interaction hamiltonian takes the form : @xmath35_{(% \\mathbf{r}\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime})}d^3r d^3r^{\\prime }   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & + \\frac{e}{c } \\;\\int \\mathbf{j}(\\mathbf{r})\\;\\mathbf{\\alpha}_e [ % \\mathbf{t}(\\mathbf{r } _",

    "the @xmath42 term is the magnetic dipole interaction between the magnetic field generated by the electrons and the nuclear magnetic dipole moment due to the extended nuclear matter distribution .",
    "the @xmath43 term is the electric quadrupole interaction between the electric field gradient from the electrons and the non - spherical charge distribution of the nucleus .",
    "the hyperfine interaction couples the electronic angular momentum @xmath26 and the nuclear one @xmath44 to an hyperfine momentum @xmath45 .",
    "the magnetic hyperfine splitting energy @xmath46 for a state @xmath47 is defined as the matrix element of the hamiltonian @xmath48 ,    @xmath49    with the matrix element @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the expression for a point nucleus , and @xmath52    is the correction term due to the finite extension of the nuclear density .    the functions @xmath53 , @xmath54 are the radial parts of the large and small components of the dirac wave function of the electron , with the quantum number @xmath55 for @xmath56 and the orbital angular momentum @xmath57 .    in the dipole approach ( @xmath42 ) the expression for @xmath58 reduces to @xmath59 a_{i } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is defined by @xmath61 with the @xmath62 components of the angular ( or spin ) magnetic moments @xmath63 . here",
    ", the summation runs over all nucleons .",
    "taking into account the density expansion of the nucleus , these moments are @xmath64 ,     \\nonumber \\\\ \\mathbf{m}^{s}(\\mathbf{r}_{i } ) & = & g_{s}^{i}[\\mathbf{s}_{i } \\int \\limits_{r_{i}}^{% \\infty } f^{\\kappa j } g^{\\kappa j}dr + \\mathbf{d}% _ { i } \\int \\limits_{0}^{r_{i}}f^{\\kappa j } g^{\\kappa j}(\\frac{r}{r_{i}}% ) ^{3 } dr ] ,      \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65}^{1}$ ] .",
    "thus @xmath60 can be expressed through the hfs constant for a point nucleus @xmath66 as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is defined as the hfs anomaly in the bohr - weisskopf effect and @xmath69 is the breit - rosenthal - crawford - shawlow ( brcs ) correction @xcite .",

    "the functions @xmath73 are the radial parts of the large and small components of the dirac wave function for the electron in the point nucleus approximation .",

    "in the experiment @xcite , the hyperfine splitting of the electronic levels ( @xmath93 ) is measured for  the ground state of be@xmath94 ions .",
    "the electronic ground state of the be@xmath94 ion is represented by the @xmath95 configuration , and the hyperfine splitting of the states @xmath96 and @xmath97 is found at about 1.256 ghz .    in the present paper",
    ", we calculate the hfs anomaly of the be isotopes using the electronic wave functions @xmath98 and @xmath99 obtained as solutions of the dirac equation @xcite taking into account the @xmath100 electron screening and the extended density of the nuclear charge distribution .",
    "the electronic wave functions in the region @xmath101 fm are obtained for the coulomb potential defined by the expression @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the charge distribution of the nucleus .",

    "@xcite ) .    in the case of a be@xmath94 ion ,",
    "there are three electrons orbiting the nucleus .",
    "we can make a simplification by considering the @xmath23 electron in the coulomb potential of the nucleus screened by the closed electronic shell @xmath117 .",
    "thus , the asymptotic electron wave functions are defined for the screened coulomb potential written in the form : @xmath118 ,   v(r)&=&\\frac{z\\alpha \\hbar c}{r}\\left [ 1 - 2\\pi \\left\\ { \\int\\limits_{0}^{r}\\rho _ { el } x^{2}dx+r\\int\\limits_{r}^{\\infty } \\rho _ { el } xdx\\right\\ } \\right .",

    "this potential can be approximated by @xmath120 where @xmath121 is fitted to reproduce the initial potential .",
    "so , the effective charge for the @xmath23 electron in the be@xmath0 ion is + @xmath122 with @xmath123 @xmath124 .",
    "finally , the electronic wave functions calculated in the interior of the nucleus are matched to those obtained with the screened coulomb potential .",
    "the hfs anomaly @xmath6 for the be@xmath94 ion is obtained from the relation @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the fermi - contact parameter found for a point nucleus @xcite . in the core+nucleon model of the be isotopes the values @xmath60 and @xmath68",
    "are determined by the valence nucleon wave function ( that , in general , is an admixture of different single particle states ) and the electronic wave function depending on the charge distribution of the nucleus .",
