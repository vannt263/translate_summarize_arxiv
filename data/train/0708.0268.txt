    "a completely new perspective was given to the study of hadronic structure , with the observation that deep inelastic exclusive experiments , such as deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) , and hard exclusive meson production ( emp ) , could in principle allow one to access spatial configurations of partons besides the relatively well known longitudinal momentum fraction ones @xcite .",
    "because of the specific role played by the partons spatial coordinates , one can also envisage progress towards the solution of the proton spin crisis through studies of the orbital angular momentum contribution of different partonic components @xcite .",
    "information from exclusive deep inelastic scattering is coded in terms of generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) representing the soft matrix elements in the process . since they were first introduced @xcite ,",
    "much progress has been made in determining their general properties in terms of the relevant kinematical variables , including the longitudinal momentum fraction taken by the struck quark , @xmath5 , the four - momentum transfer defining the scale of the deep inelastic process , @xmath6 , the four - momentum transfer squared between the initial and final proton states , @xmath7 , and the longitudinal momentum transfer fraction of the initial proton momentum , the `` skewness '' , @xmath2 , or @xmath8 , ( for reviews see refs.@xcite ) .    at present , a central issue is the definition of a quantitative , reliable approach beyond the construction of gpds from specific models and/or particular limiting cases , that can incorporate incoming experimental data in a variety of ranges of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , as they gradually become available .",
    "one hopes eventually to obtain a similar sophistication level as for the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) extracted from inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "we address this issue in the present paper .",
    "the matching between measured quantities and perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) based predictions for dvcs / emp proceeds , in principle , similarly to the inclusive case , with a few important caveats due to the fact that gpds describe _ amplitudes _ and are therefore much more elusive observables from the practical point of view of experimental measurements , than the pdfs . in dis",
    "the cross sections at large enough @xmath9 and @xmath11 ( the total invariant mass ) , where a partonic picture is expected to hold , measure directly the bjorken @xmath12 dependent structure functions ; @xmath12 is interpreted as the momentum fraction carried by the partons , modulo target mass corrections . a widely used approach is `` global fitting '' whereby pdfs are obtained from experimental data by assuming a parametric functional form at a given scale , which is : _",
    "i ) _ evolved to the scale of the data ; _ ii ) _ convoluted with the appropriate perturbatively calculated coefficient functions ; _ iii ) _ compared to the data , thus determining the parameters .    in dvcs",
    "/ emp similar factorization theorems as for the inclusive case exist .",
    "however , the phase space that has to be covered in order to extract gpds has two extra dimensions , @xmath2 and @xmath13 , and the cross sections are written in terms of convolutions of gpds over the variable @xmath5 .",
    "experiments delivering sufficiently accurate data have just begun . the comparison with experiment and the formulation of parametrizations necessarily encompasses , therefore , other strategies using additional constraints , other than from a direct comparison with the data .",
    "here we explore the constraints on the extraction of gpds provided by a combination of experimental data on nucleon form factors , pdfs , and lattice calculations of mellin moments with @xmath14 .",
    "the latter , parametrized in terms of generalized form factors ( gffs ) , were calculated by both the qcdsf @xcite and lhpc @xcite collaborations for both the unpolarized and polarized cases up to @xmath15 , .",
    "this has not been done so far because of statistical noise . ] therefore allowing to access the skewness dependence of gpds .",
    "we implemented results from refs.@xcite using two flavors of @xmath16-improved dynamical fermions .",
    "lattice qcd calculations are increasingly improving : new results can , and will be added to our determination as they become available .    in order to estimate gpds by knowing a finite set of mellin moments we adopt a strategy similar to the ones originally developed in qcd based analyses of dis data where a _ mathematically rigorous _",
    "method for inverting moments was devised @xcite .",
    "the early qcd studies were motivated by the simplifications that mellin moments offered in treating pqcd evolution . in our case , moments provided by lattice qcd represent , in addition an important source of information on gpds .",
    "we envisage a future scenario in which the calculated mellin moments will be embedded in a `` global '' analysis including determinations of gpds from experiment , and a consistent treatment of pqcd evolution .",
    "the problem of the construction of a function from its moments is mathematically meaningful so long as one establishes the necessary and sufficient conditions on the moments that a unique solution exists .",
    "a point - by - point reconstruction is therefore unattainable , however practical methods can be applied to a number of physics problems including qcd based analyses of the dis structure function data @xcite ( see also @xcite for a review of early analyses ) , so long as one aims at obtaining @xmath17 in a finite interval around @xmath18 .",
    "it should be noticed , in fact , that experimental measurements always provide discrete `` binnings '' of kinematical variables .",
    "as shown in refs.@xcite the bernstein polynomials are ideal for reproducing the deep inelastic structure functions in that they are zero at the endpoints , they are normalized to one , and they are peaked in different regions within the interval @xmath19 $ ] . because of the latter property the bernstein polynomials allow one to emphasize the behavior of the structure function at given specific regions of @xmath18 , while suppressing the others .",
    "it was found that @xmath20 moments were necessary to give a fully quantitative description of the behavior of @xmath21 . at present , only @xmath15 mellin moments are available from lattice qcd calculations , therefore one can not reach a similar level of accuracy as in the inclusive case . in this paper",
    "we show that we can , however , reduce the kinematical region where information comes strictly from this type of reconstruction using mellin moments solely to @xmath22 .",
    "the parametrization we obtained in the @xmath3 case @xcite can in fact be extrapolated smoothly to @xmath23 ( the so - called dglap @xcite region ) by a simple kinematical shift in the quarks longitudinal momenta , being based on the same partonic picture .",
    "the @xmath22 ",
    "erbl @xcite  region does not lend itself however to a clearcut interpretation in terms of quark and gluon structure .",
    "it is in fact becoming increasingly manifest that in order to extract and interpret the amplitudes from a variety of hard exclusive experiments including dvcs in the erbl region , it is fundamental to understand and connect the partonic structure of @xmath13-channel exchanges to previous information from regge phenomenology @xcite .",
    "the contribution of a regge - motivated term was already considered in quantitative studies at @xmath3 @xcite , following a similar logics as in the early ansatze for pdf parametrizations ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "regge type contributions are expected to play a much more important role for gpds at @xmath4 , specifically in the @xmath24 domain , due to the dominance of the scattering from a @xmath25 pair emerging from the initial nucleon in these processes ( fig.[fig1]b ) .",
    "the large theoretical uncertainty in the @xmath24 domain motivated us to perform our analysis concentrating on a determination of gpds in this region , dictated only by experimental data and lattice moments , and therefore in principle model independent .",
    "the price that one pays for maintaining model independence is , however , in this case , and with the present accuracy of lattice qcd determinations , a loss in predictivity in the point - by - point functional dependence of the gpds in the erbl region .",
    "our results however provide points from ab initio calculations , with given error bars in a region that can not be extracted directly from experiment .",
    "these can be used in turn for guidance to constrain the shape of possible functional forms of gpds , a question addressed in a forthcoming manuscript @xcite .",
    "finally , improvements in the accuracy of the extracted points will be made as more accurate lattice qcd results become available .",
    "an important consideration should also be given to the analytical properties of gpds at @xmath26 .",
    "this point marks the transition between the partonic and mesonic interpretations of gpds , respectively , and it acquires a particular significance only in the presence of soft matrix elements describing the non - perturbative structure of hadrons ( in _ e.g. _ a qed based description it no longer signifies a specific breakpoint ) .",
    "simple consistency arguments related to factorization @xcite require that continuity is observed at the breakpoint .",
    "recent precise measurements from jefferson lab indeed find non - vanishing values of gpds of the measured single spin asymmetry ( ssa ) at @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the continuity condition constitutes an additional constraint in our approach in addition to the ones provided by the experimental data and the lattice results .",
    "it should be remarked that our results are specifically for the flavor non - singlet ( ns ) sector .",
    "perturbative evolution is therefore slower than for the singlet and gluon cases , and it can be implemented straightforwardly similarly to the pdf case @xcite .    the main thrust of the present paper is to present an extension of the analysis of ref.@xcite using available information at @xmath27 . our method can be seen as a first step in a `` bottom up '' approach as opposed to other models presently available ( _ e.g. _ the dual model of ref.@xcite , and the double distribution based model of ref.@xcite ) . our aim is to make use of all information available both experimentally , and from ab initio calculations , and to study how to construct the functional dependence of the gpds consequentially . as in similar phenomenological studies ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) a simple and adequately flexible functional form given by the spectator diquark model is used in the partonic - process - dominated dglap region , with the goal of eventually easing into a global analysis . as for the erbl region , our scope is to define what constraints are available , that come directly from ab - initio calculations .",
    "a similar exploratory study has not been conducted so far to our knowledge .",
    "the study of a functional form in x in the erbl region that is consistent with the constraint found in our first quantitative study is the subject of a forthcoming manuscript @xcite where the real part of the dvcs interference term will be presented . as a first step , we preferred limiting the present manuscript to providing a conistent method that uses all information obtained from experimental constraints plus lattice qcd results .",
    "future extensions to the sea quarks and gluon distributions will also help disentangle the intricate interplay between perturbative evolution and shape of the initial distributions .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section ii we define the ingredients of our physically motivated parametrization in the @xmath28 case , and introduce lattice moments with a prescription to account for their chiral extrapolation . in section",
    "iii we describe the extraction from lattice moments using bernstein polynomials ; our results are compared to the recent data from jefferson lab @xcite . in section",
    "iv we draw conclusions and give an outlook .",
    "gpds can be extracted most cleanly from deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) at four - momentum transfer , @xmath9 , in the few / multi - gev region ( fig.[fig1 ] ) . for unpolarized scattering",
    "one has two independent functions : @xmath0 , and @xmath1 , from the vector ( @xmath29 ) and tensor ( @xmath30 ) interactions , respectively .",
    "these are parametrized in terms of three kinematical invariants , besides the initial photon s virtuality , @xmath9 . in this paper",
    "we adopt the following set : @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the longitudinal momentum transfer between the initial and final protons ( @xmath33 in the asymptotic limit , with bjorken @xmath34 , @xmath35 being the energy transfer associated to @xmath36 ) , @xmath37 is the momentum fraction relative to the initial proton carried by the struck parton with momentum @xmath38 , @xmath39 , is the four - momentum transfer squared . in principle , the observables for dvcs and similar exclusive processes are functions of only two independent invariants : @xmath13 and @xmath11 ( @xmath40 ) .. this is related at leading order to the skewness parameter , @xmath8 , in `` symmetric '' notation by : @xmath41 . in this representation @xmath42 . ] a partonic picture is however more conveniently described in terms of light cone ( lc ) momentum projections such as @xmath2 and @xmath5 , despite the fact that @xmath5 is not directly observable , and it appears in the amplitude as an integration variable @xcite . the need to deal with a more complicated phase space , in addition to the fact that dvcs interferes coherently with the bethe - heitler ( bh ) process , are in essence the reasons why it is more challenging to extract gpds from experiment , wherefore guidance from phenomenologically motivated parametrizations becomes important .",
    "initial experiments were conducted at hermes @xcite .",
    "however , more recently , the high precision measurements from jefferson lab @xcite have provided both the real and imaginary parts of the bethe - heitler bh - dvcs interference term at @xmath43 gev@xmath44 , and @xmath45 , showing the dominance of the twist-2 contribution .",
    "this , in turn , can be written as @xcite : @xmath46 in eq.([c ] ) , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , define the generalized compton form factors ( cffs ) for the unpolarized and polarized case , respectively ; @xmath49 are the dirac ( pauli ) form factors , @xmath50 ( for details on the photon electro - production cross section and the harmonic decomposition of its ( bh)@xmath44 , ( dvcs)@xmath44 , and bh - dvcs interference terms we refer to refs.@xcite ) .",
    "several definitions have been given connecting the cffs to gpds ( see the review in @xcite ) .",
    "we follow the notation and definitions of ref.@xcite according to which the leading order cffs can be written as : @xmath51 + \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\mathcal{p } \\int_{1-\\zeta}^1 dx \\left(\\frac{1}{x-\\zeta } + \\frac{1}{x } \\right ) f^q(x,\\zeta , t ) .",
    "\\label{cal_f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that eq.([cal_f ] ) is completely analogous to the definition in the symmetric scheme of @xcite , except for the choice of kinematics . for practical calculations it is usfeul to consider the separation into valence and sea quarks gpd components",
    "specifically , gpds are related to scattering amplitudes , at variance with the pdfs , and their quark / anti - quark content is a function of the longitudinal momentum transfer , or skewness , @xmath2 . at non - zero skewness different definitions",
    "were given in the literature ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the essence of the argument is that for gpds three separate kinematical regions define the scattering process :    _ i ) _",
    "@xmath52 , where the initial quark in fig.[fig1 ] has momentum fraction @xmath5 and the final one @xmath53 ;    _ ii ) _",
    "@xmath54 where one scatters an initial anti - quark with momentum fraction @xmath55 , into a final one with @xmath56 .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath57-channel exchange ( the lower limit of integration in eq.([cal_f ] ) is defined accordingly ) ;    _ iii ) _",
    "@xmath58 where a quark - antiquark pair emerges from the nucleon and undergoes the electromagnetic interaction . barring contributions from very low @xmath5 ( @xmath59 ) dominated by anti - quarks in the initial state , in this region the quark carries momentum @xmath60 , and the anti - quark @xmath55 .    in summary ,",
    "the amplitudes for scattering from either a quark or an anti - quark are defined in different kinematical regions . as for the identification of the valence and sea quarks contributions , analogously to the pdfs @xcite , ( by omitting the @xmath13-dependence that is not relevant here ) , one has for the forward ( @xmath3 ) case    [ f_zeta0 ]",
    "@xmath61    @xmath62 , and @xmath63 being the quark and anti - quark parton distributions from dis .",
    "therefore , the valence forward gpd , @xmath64 , is @xmath65 and , following ref.@xcite , the sea quarks distribution coincides with the anti - quarks one , @xmath66 . at @xmath28 ,    [ f_zetan0 ] @xmath67    with @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "once the physical meaning of the various regions in @xmath5 is clarified , it is therefore a matter of choice whether or not to represent the different valence and sea quarks components of gpds on the positive side of the @xmath5 axis .",
    "eqs.([f_zeta0],[fv_zeta0],[f_zetan0 ] ) are in line with ref.@xcite , where definitions where given in the context of dvcs from nuclei , that avoid the appearance of spurious symmetries in the @xmath5 dependence of the off forward distributions @xcite .",
    "notice the consequences of the valence and sea quarks separation on the structure of eq.([cal_f ] ) : while the first term includes a sum over all @xmath70 and @xmath71 distributions , the second term is given by a principal value integral where the valence and sea quarks appear in the different domains , _",
    "i ) , ii ) , iii ) _ , explained above . in particular , since the valence contribution is zero at @xmath72 , this implies that the @xmath73 term in the intergral corresponds to a singularity that can not be handled by the integration ( a similar condition appears for @xmath74 in the symmetric scheme ) . as a consequence , either the valence contribution to the cff can not be calculated alone , or the condition above dictates the dependence of the valence contribution to the gpd at @xmath75 , which should be steep enough to counter the @xmath73 type singularity .",
    "we explore this point in a forthcoming manuscript @xcite . finally , as observed in the forward case , @xmath76 , in general .",
    "this is an aspect to be still explored _",
    "e.g. _ for scattering from strange quarks in the exclusive channels .",
    "we also notice that a contamination from the pure dvcs term might be present in the extraction of the coefficient that might be large , although weighted by a kinematical factor of about @xmath77 at jlab kinematics .",
    "we give our estimate of this term in future work .",
    "models such as @xcite do not seem to accurately reproduce the data on either the imaginary or real part of eq.([c ] ) .",
    "although future experiments are planned that will allow one to directly determine whether such discrepancies could be also due to the presence of a pure dvcs contribution so far disregarded in the extraction of @xmath78 , it is at present important to provide gpd parametrizations using constraints from both inclusive deep inelastic and elastic scattering data , and _ ab initio _ lattice calculations .",
    "it is our aim to explore , in what follows , the usage of such constraints towards a parametrization built from a bottom - up approach .      in a previous publication",
    "@xcite we presented our parametrization of unpolarized gpds in the flavor non singlet ( ns ) sector based on a diquark spectator model improved by a regge term at low @xmath5 .",
    "parameters were given for skweness @xmath3 , by using constraints from both form factors and pdfs .",
    "the spectator model is ideal in this context because despite its simplicity , it has proven to be sufficiently flexible to describe ( and predict ) the main features of a number of distribution and fragmentation functions in the intermediate and large @xmath5 regions , as well as the unintegrated pdfs @xcite .",
    "at @xmath23 , the proton splits into a quark carrying a lc momentum fraction @xmath79 , transverse momentum @xmath80 , and a spectator system with @xmath81 , and @xmath82 . after undergoing the electromagnetic interaction , the final quark with momentum fraction @xmath53 , and",
    "the spectator system coalesce into an outgoing proton ( all particles are moving forward ) .",
    "the partonic configurations are therefore equivalent to the @xmath3 case , modulo a kinematical shift .",
    "the parametrization s form is therefore ( see @xcite ) :    @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the diquark model component , and @xmath85 the regge - based term .",
    "the parametrization differs from the one in @xcite only by a shift to non - zero skewness , in the kinematical variables ( a similar form is obtained for @xmath86 ) .",
    "notice the difference with other parametrizations reproducing the @xmath3 behavior @xcite , where the forward contribution is given directly by existing pdf parametrizations , @xmath62 .",
    "the latter are factored out from so - called `` profile '' of the parton distributions , namely :    @xmath87.\\ ] ]    while in this case the forward limit , @xmath88 , is automatically met by introducing explicitly @xmath62 , in our case , this needs to be enforced non trivially .    in other words , in ref.@xcite we had to simultaneously obtain new parametrizations for both the gpds and their forward limit , the pdfs at a low initial scale .",
    "this effort granted us , however , the possibility to automatically extend our parametrization to @xmath4 ( @xmath23 ) by a simple variation in the kinematics .",
    "more details will be given in section [ berns - sec ] .",
    "we subsequently analyzed the additional , @xmath2-dependent constraints given by the higher moments of gpds .",
    "the @xmath89 moments of the ns combinations : @xmath90 , and @xmath91 are available from lattice qcd @xcite , @xmath92 corresponding to the nucleon form factors .",
    "we use such constraints within a reconstruction procedure for the gpds from their moments , using bernstein polynomials .",
    "such a procedure allows us to extract values for @xmath93 and @xmath94 at three values of @xmath5 , defined as @xmath95 , @xmath96 , for each given @xmath2 and @xmath13 .",
    "the bernstein polynomials are used as weighting functions for @xmath93 and @xmath94 , emphasizing the regions around @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "as we will show in detail in section [ berns - sec ] , moments of gpds calculated using bernstein polynomials provide the values of @xmath93 and @xmath94 , defined as @xmath97 and @xmath98 , at the points @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "numerical results including the errors and dispersions in @xmath5 , respectively , are also provided in section [ berns - sec ] .",
    "finally , we observe that the lattice results on gpds moments have to be chirally extrapolated . for this purpose we extended to the @xmath99 moments a simple ansatze proposed in @xcite for the nucleon form factors .",
    "the procedure is illustrated in section [ lattice - sec ] .    because only the first three moments are known to date , by performing our analysis in the whole region of @xmath100 $ ] one obtains large theoretical uncertainties in the evaluated @xmath5 and @xmath101 values .",
    "we therefore determine the behavior of the gpds at @xmath102 , by keeping the same parameter values obtained using the form factors and pdfs constraints in ref.@xcite .",
    "we checked as explained later on that the curves at @xmath23 are consistent with the values obtained with the reconstruction procedure in the whole @xmath5 interval .",
    "the bernstein polynomials reconstruction is subsequently used in a reduced region , the `` unknown '' @xmath103 , erbl @xcite region , where one expects a definite departure from the partonic type description of the dglap region . as we shall see in section [ berns - sec ] ,",
    "reducing the size of the interval in @xmath5 provides an advantage in the gpds extraction .    below we summarize all the information that was used in our analysis :    * accurate experimental information on the nucleon form factors .",
    "* parametrizations of the ns part of pdfs ( _ e.g. _ the alekhin set from ref.@xcite ) reproducing the dis data . * lattice results for the @xmath89 moments at @xmath104 gev@xmath44 with the following features : * * only non - singlet contributions , @xmath93 , @xmath94 are provided ( see section [ lattice - sec ] ) . * * the contribution from the term @xmath105 , ( see eqs.([dirac2],[pauli2 ] ) below ) , is set equal to zero , consistently with lattice calculations @xcite ) . * * the dependence on @xmath2 is extracted from the term @xmath106 ( see eq.([a3 ] ) below ) .",
    "it should be noticed that experimental data on dvcs can in principle be systematically implemented in our extraction and will be considered in a forthcoming manuscript .",
    "_ predictions _ for the data in ref.@xcite are given in section [ berns - sec ] .",
    "we conclude by underlining once more that our goal is to provide a practical method for extracting gpds deriving from techniques that have been well tested in dis .",
    "the proposed method uses information from both experimental data and lattice results , and it is exact in that for each kinematics , or @xmath107 values , it provides the values of @xmath108 and @xmath86 in at given @xmath5 values , with calculable theoretical error . with the proposed approach",
    "we also wish to provide an alternative based on a bottom - up type of analysis , at variance with top - down models proposed so far including the double distribution ( dd ) hypothesis @xcite , on the mellin - barnes integral representation @xcite , and/or on the dual representation of ref.@xcite .",
    "our approach , similarly to what found for dis @xcite provides a different perspective on the problem of a formal extraction of gpds from their moments that tends to be more subject to uncontrolled numerical ambiguities such as the one in _",
    "e.g. _ the oscillating term inherent in the integral defining the continuation to complex @xmath109 .",
    "the mellin moments of gpds are most clearly described in the symmetric frame of @xcite , where the relevant kinematical variables are @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the @xmath12 moments of gpds are defined as @xmath112 where @xmath48 and we disregarded strange quarks contributions . @xmath113 and @xmath114 represent the form factors of local twist two operators . from the lorentz structure of these form factors ,",
    "one obtains the following polynomiality relations in @xmath8 , made explicit by using the gordon decomposition : @xmath115 @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 are the generalized form factors ( gffs ) .",
    "the latter were calculated on the lattice by both the lhpc and the qcdsf groups for the unpolarized , polarized and transversely polarized cases @xcite .",
    "since the gffs correspond to off - diagonal matrix elements of twist - two operators , it was necessary to introduce a new technique implementing all @xmath119 cubic group operators and index combinations producing the same continuum gffs @xcite in order to provide statistically accurate lattice measurements from an overdetermined set of equations . therefore , lattice calculations extend only up to @xmath120 .",
    "we list below the gffs expressions for @xmath89 using the notation of @xcite .    for @xmath92 one",
    "obtains the nucleon dirac and pauli form factors : @xmath121 for @xmath122 one has : @xmath123 in the limit @xmath124 , eqs.([dirac],[pauli ] ) give the baryon number , @xmath125 , and anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath126 : @xmath127 eq.([dirac2 ] ) gives the lc momentum fraction carried by quark @xmath70 : @xmath128 furthermore , eqs.([dirac2],[pauli2 ] ) are related through the angular momentum sum rule @xcite : @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the total  orbital plus intrinsic  angular momentum carried by the quark @xmath70 .",
    "finally , the @xmath15 moments are given by : @xmath131    in our calculation we use lattice calculations for the unpolarized gffs for @xmath89 obtained by the qcdsf collaboration using two flavors of @xmath16-improved dynamical fermions for several values of @xmath13 in the interval @xmath132 gev@xmath44 , and covering a range of pion mass values , @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "similarly to previous evaluations @xcite the gffs for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 display a dipole type behavior for all three @xmath109 values , the value of the dipole mass increasing with @xmath109 .",
    "a straightforward implementation of present lattice calculations in realistic parametrizations is hampered by the rather large discrepancy with the experimental data , associated to the large values of the pion mass , @xmath134 used in refs.@xcite .",
    "early extrapolations used a linear approximation @xcite that although improving the comparison with experiment , is not sufficient to grant the accuracy that is necessary for a quantitative parametrization .",
    "extrapolations using chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) of the gpd moments up to @xmath122 are currently being addressed using different methods : heavy baryon chpt ( hbchpt ) , in refs.@xcite , self - consistently improved chpt @xcite , and finite - range regulators techniques @xcite .",
    "while most results have bean focused on the values at @xmath135 , which are important for the determination of the nucleon orbital angular momentum , equations for @xmath136 were given explicitely in @xcite . whether this can be applied to the large @xmath134 masses where most lattice results are provided ,",
    "is still a matter of intense debate that is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in addition , the number of parameters of the calculation is rather large to enable a really precise evaluation of the moments at @xmath136 .",
    "nevertheless evaluations providing the `` t '' term with a @xmath137 error have been possible within the most recent set of lattice results @xcite . on the other side",
    ", the finite - regulator technique results by allowing for an extension of the range in pion mass considered , will conisderably reduce the uncertainty on the @xmath122 moment determination , while a number of new extrapolation methods are currently being explored we adopted a simple ansatz for the extrapolation of the dipole masses for the dirac and pauli form factors @xcite which : _",
    "i ) _ uses the connection between the dipole mass and the nucleons radius ; _ ii ) _ introduces a modification of the non analytic terms i the standard chiral extrapolation that suppresses the contribution of chiral loops at large @xmath134 . despite its simplicity the conjecture of @xcite",
    "well reproduces the trend of lattice results at large @xmath134 while satisfying the main physical criteria _",
    "i ) _ and _ ii)_. the resulting values for the `` physical '' nucleon dipole masses are both sensibly different than using a linear extrapolation , and much closer to the experimental data . as a consequence ,",
    "the proton and neutron magnetic form factors , as well as the proton electric form factors can be reproduced quite accurately , whereas non - negligible discrepancies were found only in the case of the more elusive neutron form factor .",

    "we reiterate that the choice of this simple method in spite of recent chpt developments is justified in the context of this work by the fact that on one side we need all available higher moments , up to @xmath15 , and these are not accessible with available methods ; secondly , the recent flurry of activities has been focused on the @xmath135 region , while we are primarily interested in @xmath138 where the uncertainties in the various chpt - based determinations become more important .",
    "finally , the goal of our work is to suggest an approach to determine gpds using all available constraints from both experiment and theory . while hoping that both present and future efforts will provide us with increasingly precise results , and with a method to determine larger @xmath109 moments , the role of this work is limited to implementing them within our suggested analysis as a theoretical input with a precisely determined uncertainty , independently from the merit of any specific approach used to obtain them in the first place .",

    "although there is a discrepancy with the parametrization / experimental data , its size is consistent with the previous evaluation from ref.@xcite .",
    "the error band on the lattice evaluations is a result of the fit error on the dipole mass .",

    "with a finite number of moments in hand , one can apply to gpds a reconstruction method following the approach initially used for pdfs in ref.@xcite .",
    "the procedure , that uses only moments with integer @xmath109 , introduces a complete set of positive definite polynomials , the bernstein polynomials , from which one constructs weighted averages of the gpds , around definite values of @xmath5 . as pointed out in @xcite , because of inherent uncertainties in the experimental binnings , one does not need a point - wise description of the structure functions / gpds , but _",
    "averages _ of these quantities over ranges of @xmath5 , thus making the method both mathematically sound and appealing from the practical point of view .",
    "the method is in fact an alternative to a reconstruction of the gpds from their inverse mellin transforms that however requires in principle the knowledge of the behavior with @xmath109 of the mellin moments .",

    "merging information from both experimental data and lattice , and taking into account pqcd evolution , clearly involves a more complex phase space than for pdf studies , and makes the implementation of the inverse mellin transform method a prohibitive task .",
    "we consider therefore : @xmath169 where the weight functions are the bernstein polynomials : @xmath170 that , by definition , are functions that are concentrated on restricted ranges within the @xmath100 $ ] interval , specifically around the values : @xmath171 with a width given by the dispersion @xmath172 @xcite . )",

    "slightly larger discrepancies arise .",
    "it should be also noticed that the reconstruction using bernstein polynomials is always less accurate at small @xmath5 , a feature already noticed in @xcite .",
    "such a discrepancy is however small with respect to current error bars on the lattice moments determinations .",
    "moreover , if necessary , _ i.e. _ as more accurate lattice results and data become available , it can be improved upon either by implementing higher order corrections @xcite , or by using modified bernstein functions as _",
    "e.g. _ in @xcite .    in figures",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] we use the three available lattice moments ( section [ lattice - sec ] ) to reconstruct @xmath93 . in this case , for each value of @xmath2 and @xmath13 , one obtains the following values of @xmath182 :    @xmath183 and weighted average values of @xmath184 :    @xmath185 , \\\\ \\overline{h}_{12}(\\overline{x}_{12 } ) & = & 6 a_{20 } - 6   \\left [ a_{30 } +   \\left ( -\\frac{2\\zeta}{2-\\zeta } \\right)^2 a_{32 } \\right ] , \\\\     \\overline{h}_{22}(\\overline{x}_{22 } ) & = & 3 \\left [ a_{30}+    \\left ( -\\frac{2\\zeta}{2-\\zeta } \\right)^2 a_{32 } \\right ] . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in fig.[fig6 ] we show the results for the weighted averages , with their given width calculated according to eq.([width ] ) .",

    "they read : @xmath206 notice that the resulting parameters for @xmath204 found in ref.@xcite are sensibly different for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , since at variance with the forward case governed by @xmath207 where no specific constraint exists for @xmath1 , these two functions are impacted on differently by the dirac and pauli form factors , respectively .",
    "moreover , the fit parameters are not numerically similar to the ones from regge phenomenology since the diquark term defined in eqs.([param1_h ] ) , ( [ param1_e ] ) keeps on being important at low @xmath5and @xmath13 thus interfering with the regge part of the parametrization .",
    "the overall behavior of @xmath0 is however consistent with the parameter values from regge phenomenology ( see discussion in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "finally , it should be remarked that eqs.([hande ] ) present an approximate treatment of the spin structure , and that improved spectator models such as the ones recently worked out in ref.@xcite should be adopted for a full consideration of all gpds , and of their spatial d.o.f . interpretation .",
    "this is true in our case also for the function @xmath1 where we chose a rather crude approximation , justified in our case by the goal of our paper that largely makes use of moments of gpds .",
    "it should be kept in mind that this approximation is expected to eventually break down at very large @xmath5 , as it already can be seen in ref.@xcite in reproducing sensible values for the transverse displacements @xmath208 .",
    "a full treatment of the spin structure of gpds is however beyond the scope of this paper and it will be considered elsewhere . for @xmath4 , @xmath204 is also modified with respect to the @xmath3 case through a @xmath2-dependent kinematical shift in @xmath13 resulting from the fact that @xmath209 where the fourier conjugate to the impact parameter is now @xmath210 , and @xmath211 ( @xmath212 reduces to @xmath213 at @xmath3 @xcite ) , yielding : @xmath214 more details on this transformation are given in appendix [ regge_app ] . from fig.[fig6 ] one can notice a very good agreement between the bernstein reconstructed values , and the parametrization in the dglap region obtained by perturbatively evolving at leading order ( lo ) eqs.([param1_h ] ) , ( [ param1_e ] ) to the scale @xmath215 gev@xmath44 , where the lattice results where evaluated .",
    "we also show the missing area ( shaded area in the figure ) obtained through the polynomiality condition , by ensuring that the sum of the areas in the erbl and dglap regions , respectively , gives the form factor value at the given value of @xmath13 .",

    "the missing areas , which value is given by @xmath225 , are also highlighted in the figure .",
    "the theoretical errors displayed in the figure are from two sources : the lattice errors , and the fit errors ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) , added in quadrature .",
    "one can see that the effect of reducing the interval over which the weighted areas are taken , produces much larger errors on the moments , due to the presence of powers of @xmath226 in eqs.([berns_zeta ] ) .",
    "the determination of @xmath93 is therefore more precise at larger @xmath2 values ( @xmath227 ) .",
    "the property of polynomiality is satisfied by construction .",
    "furthermore , we also notice that the area spanned by the bernstein moments , and the value of the missing area calculated from eq.([missing_a ] ) are in agreement within the theoretical errors .",
    "we reiterate that explicit model dependence is minimized in the determination of @xmath93 in the erbl region because of the phenomenological constraints obtained from the form factor data , the pdf parametrizations for the non - singlet ( ns ) sector , and lattice qcd results .",
    "finally , the results in the erbl region seem to display a visible pattern in the @xmath2 , @xmath13 , and @xmath5 variables .",
    "this will allow us in principle to construct a specific form for a parametrization driven by phenomenological constraints only , that will be present in future work @xcite .    in figs.[fig9 ] and [ fig10 ]",
    "we show the results of our parametrization at @xmath228 for the imaginary part of the bethe - heitler bh - dvcs interference term at leading order , eq.([c ] ) , for proton and neutron , respectively .",
    "the proton results are compared with recent data from jefferson lab @xcite , at @xmath229 , and @xmath43 gev@xmath44 , while the neutron ones are presented at the kinematics of the forthcoming analysis from ref.@xcite .",
    "notice that jefferson lab kinematics is expected to be dominated by ns contributions and it is therefore ideal for a comparison with the model developed here .",
    "we observe an excellent agreement with the data for all variants of our parametrization , except for perhaps the largest value in @xmath13 , that lies , however , at the margin of the experimental acceptance .",
    "while the proton contribution is governed by @xmath0 , the neutron one is directly sensitive to @xmath1 , as shown also in our calculation using two variants of our fit that differ sensibly in the treatment of the less constrained @xmath1 distribution .",
    "we also tested the role of pqcd evolution in this region by showing results at two different scales , @xmath230 and @xmath231 gev@xmath44 , respectively .",
    "as expected in the ns sector , pqcd evolution turns out to be slow , and it is therefore not to be considered a major concern .",
    "we presented a parametrization of the unpolarized gpds , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 , constructed by using a spectator model for the quark - nucleon scattering amplitude in which the forward limit is obtained by fitting directly to pdfs in the non singlet sector .",
    "this is at variance with exisiting phenomenologically constrained models where the forward limit is obtained using directly the results from exisiting parametrizations of pdfs , and it allows us to better study the role of regge - type exchanges , that are disengaged , in our case , from the specific form used for the parton distributions .",
    "the other constraints defining our parametrization at zero skewness are provided by the electric and nucleon form factor data . by analyzing directly the vertex structure of the scattering amplitude we extended our predictions to the non - zero skewness case obtained by modifying the kinematical variables dependence in our expressions for the quark scattering ( dglap ) dominated region . in the @xmath103 ( erbl ) region , where a quark - antiquark pair from the initial proton participates in the scattering process , we took into account additional constraints provided by the higher , @xmath2-dependent , moments of gpds .",
    "these are in principle available from recent lattice calculations , provided reasonable chiral extrapolation procedures are implemented . a reconstruction procedure based on bernstein polynomials , that allows to extract in a largely model independent way the gpds in the elusive erbl region ,",
    "is proposed .",
    "we showed that with a larger number of moments ( up to @xmath232 ) , a perspective perhaps possible in the near future @xcite , one could in principle obtain a highly accurate description of gpds in a wide portion of the phase space .    differently from the double distribution based approaches that represent a model calculation ,",
    "the proposed method is , for the first time to our knowledge , an attempt to obtain a realistic parametrization constrained by phenomenological input , namely by experimental data on form factors and pdfs in combination with lattice results .",
    "given the paucity of current direct experimental measurements of gpds , our goal is to provide more stringent and less model dependent predictions that can be useful for both model builders , in order to gain insight on the dynamics of gpds , and for experimenters in planning future dvcs and other related hard exclusive scattering experiments .",
    "finally , our approach can be compared to recently developed models relying on t - dependent moments , namely the dual model , a project to be pursued in future investigations .",
    "in addition , a more detailed treatment of the spectator model used in developing our parametrization is on its way , that will allow to extend our approach to the spin dependent sector where many lattice results exist , and where a rich experimental program is being pursued .",
