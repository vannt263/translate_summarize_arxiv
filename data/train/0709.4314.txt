    "linear optics is a useful tool for constructing quantum circuits by utilizing optical interference @xcite .",
    "a number of quantum gates @xcite were demonstrated with linear optics . however , the operation of these gates has been non - deterministic , because deterministic operation requires nonlinear interactions between photons .",
    "the success probability of the linear optical cnot gate is at most 1/4 @xcite , for instance .",
    "therefore , it is quite difficult to implement large - scale quantum computations with linear optics such as shor s factorization algorithm@xcite , because the more quantum gates the quantum algorithm requires , the less the success probability .",
    "it is becoming more important to implement deterministic quantum operations .",
    "we have found that the quantum leader election ( qle ) protocol can be operated deterministically only with linear optics , and have demonstrated nearly deterministic operation in an experiment with two - photon interference .",
    "before considering the qle protocol , let us briefly introduce distributed computing .",
    "a distributed computing system is a set of computers connected via network channels and it offers the fault - tolerance and the scalability of the system .",
    "the system operates autonomously with a distributed algorithm@xcite that effectively coordinates the computers . in a lot of distributed algorithms ,",
    "computers generate a @xmath0 , which is a kind of script that prescribes the operation or gives permission for them to access shared data .",
    "a computer does some operations based on the token and relays it to the next computer .",
    "then , the next computer receives the token and does operations , and so on . after going round the whole network ,",
    "one distributed algorithm is completed .",
    "if the token is lost during the operation , a unique computer must be specified to restore the only one token , otherwise two or more tokens that tangles the operation may be generated .",
    "such a unique computer is called the leader , and the decision of the leader is known as the leader election problem @xcite . since only one leader should be chosen before performing any distributed algorithms , the leader election problem is one of the most fundamental problems in the distributed computing .",
    "many studies on the leader election problem have been done in the long history of computer science .",
    "we can summarize the leader election problem as :    leader election problem : :    @xcite   +    _ let n be the number of computers connected to the network .",
    "each    computer i @xmath1 has a state    @xmath2 and is initially set to identical values    @xmath3 .",
    "set the unique computer    @xmath4 , to @xmath5 ,    otherwise , @xmath6",
    "@xmath7 _    in this problem , there are no third persons such as human beings to determine the leader ; therefore , the computers must do the same operations during the protocol .",
    "if the network is non - anonymous , ( @xmath8 for @xmath9 ) , in which all computers have an identifier ( i.e. , mac address ) , this protocol can be solved quite easily by comparing each identifier .",
    "the computer that has the largest value of identifier can be elected to the leader .",
    "however if the network is anonymous ( @xmath10 ) , in which the computers have no identifiers and they are in an identical initial state , the leader election is no longer trivial .",
    "they have to distinguish themselves and finally obtain different identifiers to distinguish one another using the same operation .",
    "in other words , they have to obtain asymmetric states from the symmetric state after identical operations .",
    "it is widely recognized @xcite that no classical algorithm can offer a deterministic solution within a finite time to this problem .",
    "the possible classical algorithms are stochastic @xcite , where each computer automatically generates an identifier at random .",
    "then , some computers generate the same identifiers with a certain probability , and leader election fails .",
    "in contrast , tani @xmath11 proposed a new quantum algorithm @xcite that could solve this problem deterministically within a finite time .",
    "the process for the quantum protocol is as follows :    quantum leader election protocol : :     +    computers with identical quantum states    ( @xmath12 ) are    connected via quantum and classical communication channels .",
    "a unique    leader is elected after all computers repeats the following processes    for n-1 times for n parties :    +    1 .",
    "entangled state generation ,    2 .   quantum communication ,    3 .   local quantum operation , and    4 .",
    "measurement and classical communication .",
    "the quantum state of each computer is identical in this protocol .",
    "after quantum communication , the computers build a quantum correlation by sharing entanglement .",
    "they can finally derive a non - identical measurement result .",
    "we have demonstrated the two - party qle protocol , which makes the implementation simple , because it only requires one execution of processes ( i ) @xmath13 ( iv ) without any ancillary qubits .       and",
    "@xmath14,width=321 ]    there is a schematic of the two - party qle circuit is shown in fig.[cir ] . since all parties must perform exactly the same operations , alice s setup is line symmetric to bob s .",
    "both alice and bob have two optical ports defined as the @xmath15 and the @xmath14 , respectively , and the four detectors a1 , a2 , b1 , and b2 are named according to the symmetry shown in fig.[cir ] here , the qubit is represented by the photon number , where single photon state @xmath16 represents qubit 1 and vacuum state @xmath17 represents a qubit 0 .",
    "the circuit consists of four parts ( i ) @xmath13 ( iv ) , carrying out the qle process are given as follows :    [ [ entangled - state - generation ] ] entangled state generation + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +     +  alice and bob must prepare identical symmetric state @xmath18 , which corresponds to a single photon pair emerged in their guest ports .",

    "the corrected coincidence counts are plotted in fig.[baro](a ) .",
    "the theoretically predicted values from table [ table3 ] have been shown in fig.[baro](b ) for comparison .",
    "figure[baro](a ) shows good agreement with ( b ) . bars ( i ) and ( iii ) in fig.[baro ] indicate corrected two - photon detection and @xmath23 detection , respectively . in these cases leader election",
    "is successfully achieved .",
    "bars ( ii ) and ( iv ) , on the other hand , result from imperfect two - photon interference .",
    "however , bars ( ii ) can be regarded as successful events because the detection of alice and bob is different .",
    "bars ( iv ) indicates that the same detector ( a1&b1 , and a2&b2 ) clicked on alice and bob , then leader election failed . hence , the imperfect two - photon interference is responsible for the performance of the experimental qle protocol .",

    ", we can not precisely calculate the success probability .",
    "therefore , we rewrite eq . using the coincidence probabilities between four detectors , derived in appendix [ app1 ] , as @xmath38\\label{eq43}\\\\ & \\hspace{3.2 cm } \\gamma\\equiv r / t \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 correspond to the branching ratio of beam splitters and the visibility of two - photon interference . using eq .",

    "both coincidence counts fit the sinusoidal curves with visibility @xmath41 .",
    "hence , the success probability of leader election is calculated as 95.0@xmath420.48% , and the operation is therefore almost deterministic .",
    "let us examine how advantageous the experimental results were over the classical limit . to do this",
    ", we should not consider only success probability but also communication complexity .",
    "communication complexity is characterized by the costs of communications between computers to complete algorithms .",
    "it is commonly recognized in computer science that performance of distributed algorithms can be evaluated with the communication complexity .    as shown in appendix [ app2 ] , the optimal classical algorithm involves repeating and comparing the one - bit random number generated by both alice and bob until they generate a different number .",
    "the expected minimum costs of communication @xmath43 , to complete leader election is calculated as 4 .    the quantum leader election , on the other hand , is completed by operating the quantum circuits shown in fig .",
    "as noted in sec.ii , alice and bob can finish leader election without the classical communication .",
    "the total communication costs between alice and bob is 2-qubit quantum communication to exchange their guest ports .",
    "it is clear that ideal quantum leader election is advantageous over classical algorithms because leader election is completed deterministically only with 2-qubit quantum communication .",
    "however , the two photon interference is not perfect in the experiment .",
    "that causes a failure of qle with a finite probability ( p=95.0@xmath420.48% per one trial ) . in the circuit depicted by fig2 ,",
    "the detection pattern for alice and bob become the same ( ( iv ) a1&b1 or a2&b2 ) with certain probability . then",
    ", if alice receives a single photon at `` a1 '' , bob might receive one at `` b1 '' .",
    "she can not determine at which detector bob has actually received a single photon . since the leader must be elected uniquely , only the successful detection event ( iii ) must be _ post - selected_. therefore , alice and bob have to inform one another of their detection events using 2-bit classical communication to verify their detection events .",
    "the expected communication costs can be calculated along the flow chart given in fig.[flow ] : alice and bob check the photon number they received .",
    "if they received two photons with a probability of @xmath44 , then the leader election is completed only with 2-qubit quantum communication .",
    "otherwise , they need to verify the results with 2-bit classical communication .",

    "note that without two - photon interference ( @xmath40=0 ) the @xmath51 is equivalent to the classical limit .",
    "however , as shown in fig.[complot ] even if two - photon interference is perfect ( @xmath40=1 , @xmath53=1 ) @xmath51 does not become that of the ideal case , but approaches to three .",
    "this extra one - bit is still leveraged for the verification of the detection events , because alice and bob never know that the operation is in the ideal regime .",
    "we obtain a visibility @xmath40 of 0.845@xmath54% , the expected total communication costs can be calculated as 3.17@xmath420.06 which overcomes the classical limit .    finally , we touch upon the extension of our implementation for more than three party case . in the case of multi parties ,",
    "the qle protocol requires cnot operation , which is no longer deterministic with linear optics .",
    "moreover all the parties must prepare a cat state and exchange them .",
    "the probability to generate such multi photon states with spdc would be much lower and the optical circuit would be much more complicated than two party case . for the above reasons , it is difficult to implement multi party qle protocol with liner optics .",
    "we demonstrated the experimental 2-party quantum leader election . unlike conventional probabilistic quantum circuits based on linear optics ,",
    "our leader election circuit can operate deterministically only with linear optics .",
    "we derived the success probability @xmath55 and expected total communication costs to complete leader election @xmath51 in terms of two - photon interference visibility in order to evaluate our experimental result .",
    "finally , we have obtained nearly deterministic results for a success probability of 95.0@xmath420.48% and an expected total communication costs of 3.17@xmath420.06 , both of which improve upon the classical limit .",
