    "in this situation , the neutrino dispersion change under the medium influence is being usually neglected , because the neutrino dispersion is defined by the weak interaction while the photon dispersion is defined by the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "one more possibility could be formally considered when the photon dispersion was absent , and the process of the radiative neutrino transition @xmath13 would be caused by the neutrino dispersion only . as the left - handed neutrino dispersion is only changed , transitions become possible caused by the @xmath7 interaction with the neutrino chirality change , e.g. due to the neutrino magnetic dipole moment .",
    "just this situation called the `` spin light of neutrino '' ( @xmath14 ) , was first proposed and investigated in detail in an extended series of papers.@xcite  @xcite    however , it is evident that in the analysis of this effect such an important phenomenon as plasma influence on the photon dispersion can not be ignored .",
