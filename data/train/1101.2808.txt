    "we tested the metallicity calibration of @xcite ( hereafter b05 ) , as well as the calibrations of @xcite ( hereafter ja09 ) and @xcite ( hereafter sl10 ) , with a sample of 17 m dwarf secondaries with a wide ( @xmath0 arcsec separation ) physical fgk companion .",
    "following b05 , three papers with different calibrations were published : ja09 , sl10 , and @xcite ( hereafter ra10 ) .",
    "each work claims a calibration with a better precision than the previous ones , and in general , poor v photometry is identified as a serious limitation . in order to address the photometric limitation ,",
    "only m stars with precise v photometry ( @xmath1 0.04 mag ) were selected .",
    "most stars have v magnitude uncertainties of 0.01 or 0.02 mag .",
    "note that the ra10 calibration was not tested because it requires ir indices that we do not have .",
    "this test will be done in the near future .",
    "we found that the metallicity values of our stars ( obtained from the fgk primary component ) are in reasonable agreement with the [ fe / h ] values obtained with all calibrations , as can be seen in fig .",
    "however , our calibrators are found to be more metal poor ( on average ) than both ja09 and sl10 calibrations .    a better photometry did not improve the dispersion measured around the different calibrations .",
    "this means that precision on v photometry may not be the main limitation in the derivation of the [ fe / h ] calibration .",
    "table 1 . shows a quantitative comparison between the calibrations .",
    "we note that the rms , @xmath2 and the @xmath3 values were offset - corrected . in general , the calibrations have similar offsets , @xmath4 , @xmath2 , and correlation coefficients .",
    "interestingly , the calibration of b05 ( 1 ) has the lowest offset and rms .",
    "however , the correlation coefficient is a bit lower than the values of ja09 and sl10 . the results are inconclusive and require further study .",
    ".comparison of the residuals offset , @xmath4 , residual mean square ( @xmath2 ) , and adjusted square of the multiple correlation coefficient ( @xmath3 ) of the calibrations of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite applied to our data .",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 definitions were taken from @xcite . [",

    "<S> the determination of the stellar parameters of m dwarfs is of prime importance in the fields of galactic , stellar and planetary astronomy . </S>",
    "<S> m stars are the least studied galactic component regarding their fundamental parameters . yet , they are the most numerous stars in the galaxy and contribute to most of its total ( baryonic ) mass . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we are interested in their metallicity in order to study the star - planet connection and to refine the planetary parameters . as a preliminary result we present a test of the metallicity calibrations of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite using a new sample of 17 binaries with precise v band photometry . </S>"
