    "exponentially localized solitary waves arise in nature as a balance between the steepening effects of nonlinearity and the spreading effects of dispersion .",
    "these fundamental , nonlinear coherent structures exhibit an amplitude - dependent phase speed , often with larger waves propagating faster than slower ones , e.g. @xcite .",
    "a distinguishing feature of solitary waves in one - dimension is the nature of the resulting interaction when a larger , trailing solitary wave overtakes a smaller , leading wave , a scenario sometimes referred to as strong interaction of solitary waves @xcite .",
    "a classical model of weakly nonlinear solitary wave interactions is the korteweg de - vries ( kdv ) equation . unlike in the case of linear waves ,",
    "where superposition applies , the nonlinear interaction is characterized by the larger wave decreasing in height and experiencing a forward shift in position , while the smaller solitary wave increases in amplitude and experiences a negative position shift @xcite .",
    "the two solitary waves then emerge from the interaction with their initial profiles and speeds restored .",
    "the absence of interaction - induced radiation is associated with mathematical solitons and complete integrability of the governing equation , as is the case for kdv .",
    "the exact two soliton kdv solution was derived @xcite and the soliton overtaking interation has been classified by amplitude ratio into three distinct regimes according to the qualitative structure during the interaction @xcite .",
    "when the ratio of the trailing and leading amplitudes is sufficiently small , a bimodal structure persists through the interaction with the trailing wave passing its mass forward to the leading wave .",
    "when the ratio is large , the interaction is unimodal , with the larger wave engulfing the smaller one before emitting it . for intermediate ratios ,",
    "there is a hybrid state , in which the interaction begins with the larger wave absorbing the smaller one and forming an asymmetric , unimodal mass . during the peak of the interaction , a distinctly bimodal wave appears before the process undoes itself ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : interacts_numerics ] for images of each interaction type in the context of the model equation considered here ) .",
    "this classification scheme for kdv depends solely on the ratio of the soliton amplitudes due to the existence of scaling and galilean symmetries .",
    "it has been confirmed experimentally in the case of weakly nonlinear , shallow water waves @xcite . due to a capillary instability and small dissipation ,",
    "solitary water waves are limited to nondimensional amplitudes less than @xmath0 @xcite , thus water waves are a limited system in which to probe large amplitude , conservative solitary wave interactions .",
    "moreover , experiments and numerical simulations of the water wave equations accessed amplitudes only up to @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "thus , to the authors knowledge , a systematic , quantitative classification of strongly nonlinear solitary wave interaction behaviors in any physical system is lacking experimentally and theoretically .    in this work , we extend the classification of overtaking interactions of solitary waves to a nonintegrable , strongly nonlinear , dissipationless / dispersive wave equation , the so - called conduit equation , cf .",
    "@xcite and to experiments involving solitary wave interactions with nondimensional amplitudes up to @xmath2 .",
    "the conduit equation arises in the study of viscous fluid conduits , a medium in which solitary waves have been studied experimentally in isolation @xcite and post - interaction @xcite , but not during the interaction process .",
    "the viscous fluid conduit setting is realized by introducing a steady source of buoyant , viscous fluid to a quiescent medium of heavier , more viscous fluid . a stable , fluid - filled pipe is formed .",
    "slow changes in the rate of injection induce interfacial dynamics involving a maximal balance between buoyancy of the intrusive fluid and the resistance to motion by the exterior fluid ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : expt_schematic ] ) .",
    "the scalar , nonlinear , dispersive conduit equation capturing the interfacial dynamics has been derived from the full set of coupled fluid equations @xcite .",
    "unlike well - known models of small amplitude , weakly nonlinear , interfacial fluid dynamics such as the kdv @xcite and benjamin - ono @xcite equations , the conduit equation is derived under long wave assumptions only , valid for large amplitudes @xcite , much like the green - naghdi ( or serre , su - gardner ) equations of large amplitude , shallow water waves @xcite .",
    "moreover , large amplitude conduit solitary waves are asymptotically stable @xcite , exhibit good agreement with experiments @xcite , and are robust , physical features of viscous fluid conduit interfacial dynamics .    using careful numerical simulations",
    ", we find that although the conduit equation does not possess the kdv galilean invariance , the qualitative lax classification scheme from kdv theory extends to the strongly nonlinear regime for physically realizable solitary wave amplitudes .",
    "the type of interaction depends on the absolute amplitudes of the two waves , rather than solely on their ratio .",
    "a scaling invariance of the conduit equation renders a unit solitary wave background but can not be used to scale individual solitary wave amplitudes .",
    "our numerical computations demonstrate small energy loss ( @xmath3 relative change in the solitary wave two - norm ) due to interaction , also numerically observed in a closely related equation @xcite .",
    "this confirms the non - integrability of the conduit equation , as shown by the painlev test @xcite .",
    "however , any dispersive radiation following experimental solitary wave interaction was below the resolution of our imaging system , a feature also observed in previous experiments @xcite .",
    "this suggests that while not _",
    "mathematical _ solitons , conduit solitary waves are _ physical _ solitons .",
    "we support these numerical observations with quantitative interaction classification experiments , which are in excellent agreement and represent the first observations of the mixed and unimodal interaction types in viscous fluid conduits .",
    "the importance of this work extends beyond the remarkable agreement between theoretical and numerical predictions of conduit solitary wave dynamics and our experimental observations .",
    "in particular , the overtaking interaction between two solitary waves can be seen as a fundamental property of one - dimensional , dissipationless , dispersive hydrodynamics . as such",
    ", these observations further establish the viscous fluid conduit setting as a practically accessible experimental and theoretical platform for future investigations into solitary waves , slowly modulated nonlinear wavetrains , and their interactions , for which quantitative experiments in any physical system are essentially lacking in the literature .",
    "moreover , the fact that we do not observe qualitatively new behaviors in the interactions of solitary waves beyond the weakly nonlinear regime is highly nontrivial due to the lack of integrability and the increased dimensionality of the parameter space .",
    "this suggests there could be some robustness or universality to the lax categories for wave equations which asymptotically reduce to kdv",
    ". there is also renewed interest in the nature of two soliton interactions in integrable and nearly integrable systems in connection with the theory of soliton gas ( or soliton turbulence ) @xcite .",
    "interactions falling into different lax categories have distinct effects on the statistical characteristics of soliton turbulence @xcite , and thus viscous fluid conduits provide a promising setting for the experimental study of statistical properties of incoherent soliton gases .    in the following section",
    ", we present the theoretical foundations for the classification of conduit solitary waves and describe the experimental set - up .",
    "section [ sec : classification ] presents the details of our findings , and the manuscript is concluded in   [ sec : conclusions ] with a discussion of future directions .",
    "in this section , we give an overview of the theoretical foundations needed for classifying viscous fluid conduit solitary wave interactions .",
    "we provide intuition regarding the physical effects that give rise to interfacial dynamics , develop relevant numerical tools , and describe the experimental set - up .",
    "a complete mathematical description of the viscous fluid conduit setting requires the consideration of the full system of navier - stokes equations for the intrusive and exterior fluids , with boundary conditions along a moving , free interface . to subvert this difficulty ,",
    "an approximate model governing the interfacial dynamics has been derived from physical principles @xcite and via an asymptotic , multiple scales procedure @xcite using the ratio of the viscosities as the small parameter , @xmath4 where @xmath5 indicates the ( dynamic ) viscosity of the intrusive fluid and @xmath6 that of the exterior fluid .",
    "here we outline the asymptotic derivation and identify the additional key nondimensional quantities and assumptions required to ensure model validity for comparison with experimental parameters .    the steady injection from below of a buoyant , viscous fluid into a basin of a much more viscous fluid evolves to form a vertically uniform , axisymmetric conduit , well - described by the governing equations of poiseuille - type flow @xcite .",
    "in this unperturbed setting , the vertical velocity of the intrusive fluid is driven by a vertical pressure gradient due to buoyancy , and the conduit radius is set by the injection rate , assuming the velocity is @xmath7 at the interface . in response to perturbations of the injection rate ,",
    "radial velocities are excited along the interface , inducing a normal , viscous stress , which balances the pressure difference between the two fluids across the boundary .",
    "this dominant balance is satisfied , provided the following assumptions hold : ( 1 ) the vertical variation along the conduit wall is small relative to the radial , i.e. the vertical length scale @xmath8 is large relative to the radius of the unperturbed conduit @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( 2 ) the two fluids are miscible with negligible mass diffusion across the interface , and ( 3 ) the reynolds number of the intrusive fluid , defined to be @xmath11 for intrusive fluid density @xmath12 and density difference @xmath13 , is no larger than @xmath14 . under these provisions ,",
    "the vertical pressure gradient within the conduit has two contributions , one from buoyancy and the other from viscous stress .",

    "conduit solitary waves , first considered by @xcite , are derived by introducing the ansatz @xmath24 , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the wave speed and @xmath27 decays exponentially to a background constant , here taken to be unity without loss of generality . inserting this form of the solution into eq .   and integrating twice yields the ordinary differential equation ( ode ) defining the solitary wave profile @xmath28 , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total _",

[ fig : expt_schematic ] , used to study conduit solitary waves is an acrylic cylinder with square sides 4  cm by 4  cm and a height of 90  cm , filled to a depth of approximately 75  cm with a generic brand light corn syrup . to ensure miscibility , the intrusive fluid",
    "was taken to be a 70:30 mixture of corn syrup and water , with food coloring used for imaging .",
    "this set - up closely follows previous experiments by @xcite .",
    "injection of the intrusive fluid through the base of the apparatus was precisely controlled by use of an automated syringe pump , with the base injection rate 0.1  ml / min to create a vertically uniform , background conduit .",
    "solitary waves were formed by producing an additional localized pulse in the rate of injection using a second syringe pump , connected to the apparatus via a y - junction , hence affording precision control on the size of the solitary waves generated .",

    "nondimensional , solitary wave amplitudes relative to background were measured by counting pixels across the conduit from still frame images captured with a digital slr camera .",
    "the dimensional radius of the background conduit , held constant throughout the experiments , was measured by comparing images of the background conduit with a grid of known size attached to the back wall of the apparatus . to compute the correction due to the projection of the conduit fluid in the middle of the apparatus onto the back wall ,",
    "the grid was compared with a copy of the same grid submerged within the filled apparatus before injection commenced .",
    "errors due to imaging techniques and measurement were estimated by measuring the diameter of the background conduit across a range of images yielding a standard deviation of 2% , on the order of the viscosity measurements .",
