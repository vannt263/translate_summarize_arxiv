    "automatic object recognition and image classification are important and challenging tasks .",
    "this paper is inspired by the remarkable recent work of poggio , serre , and their colleagues  @xcite , on rapid object categorization using a feedforward architecture closely modeled on the human visual system .",
    "the main directions it departs from that work are twofold .",
    "first , trading - off biological accuracy for computational efficiency , our results exploit more engineering - motivated mathematical tools such as wavelet and grouplet transforms  @xcite , allowing faster computation and limiting ad - hoc parameters .",
    "second , the approach is generalized by adding a degree of _ feedback _ ( another known component of human perception ) , yielding significant performance and robustness improvement in multiple - object scenes . in experiments ,",
    "the resulting scale- and translation - invariant algorithm achieves or exceeds state - of - the - art performance in object recognition , but also in texture and satellite image classification , and in language identification .",
    "as in  @xcite , the algorithm is hierarchical . in addition , motivated in part by the relative uniformity of cortical anatomy  @xcite , the two layers of the hierarchy are made to be computationally similar , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : algo ] .",
    "layer one performs a wavelet transform  @xcite in the @xmath0 unit followed by a local maximum operation in the @xmath1 unit .",
    "the transform in the @xmath2 unit in layer two is similar to the grouplet transform  @xcite , and is followed by a global maximum operation in the @xmath3 unit .",
    "+        @xmath4 * wavelet transform*. the frequency and orientation tuning of cells in visual cortex v1 can be interpreted as performing a wavelet transform of the retinal image  @xcite .",
    "let us denote @xmath5 a gray - level image of size @xmath6 .",
    "a translation - invariant wavelet transform is performed on the ] where @xmath7 denotes the orientation ( horizontal , vertical , diagonal ) , @xmath8 is a wavelet function and @xmath9 are the wavelet coefficients .",
    "scale invariance is achieved by a normalization @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the image energy within the support of the wavelet @xmath12 .",
    "one can verify that @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the coefficients of @xmath5 and of its @xmath16-time zoomed version @xmath17 .",
    "the normalization also makes the recognition invariant to global linear illumination change .",
    "+ @xmath18 * local maximum * limited translation invariance is achieved at this stage by keeping the local maximum of @xmath14 coefficients in a subsampling procedure : @xmath19 the maximum being taken at each scale @xmath20 and orientation @xmath21 within a spatial neighborhood of size proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "the resulting @xmath23 map at scale @xmath20 and orientation @xmath21 is thus of size @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 * grouplet - like transform*. cells in visual cortex v2 and v4 have larger receptive fields comparing to those in v1 and are tuned to geometrically more complex stimuli such as contours and corners  @xcite .",
    "the geometrical grouplets recently proposed by mallat  @xcite imitate this mechanism by grouping and re - transforming the wavelet coefficients .",
    "the procedure in @xmath2 is similar to the grouplet transform . instead of grouping the wavelet coefficients with a multi - scale geometrically adaptive association field and then re - transforming them with haar - like functions as in  @xcite ,",
    "responses of @xmath2 are obtained via inner products between @xmath23 coefficients and sliding patch functions of different sizes : @xmath26 where @xmath27 of support size @xmath28 are patch functions that group the 3 wavelet orientations in a square of size @xmath29 .",
    "while the grouplet functions are adaptively chosen to fit the geometry in the image  @xcite , the patch functions @xmath27 , @xmath30 are learned with a simple random sampling as in  @xcite : each patch is extracted at a random scale and a random position from the @xmath23 coefficients of a randomly selected training image , the rationale being that patterns that appear with high probability are likely to be learned .",
    "+ @xmath31 * global maximum*. a global maximum operation in space and in scale is applied on @xmath32 and the resulting @xmath33 coefficients @xmath34 are thus invariant to image translation and scale change . + * classification * the classification uses @xmath33 coefficients as features and thus inherits the translation and scale invariance .",
    "while various classifiers such as svms can be used , a simple but robust nearest neighbor classifier will be applied in the experiments .",
    "structures that appear with a high probability are likely to be learned as patch functions through random sampling .",
    "however , they are not necessarily salient and neither are the resulting @xmath33 features .",
    "this suggests active selection of the learned patches .",
    "for example , lowe and mutch have constructed sparse patches by retaining one salient direction at each position  @xcite .",
    "a simple patch selection is proposed here by sorting the variances of the @xmath33 coefficients of the _ training _ images .",
    "a small @xmath35 variance implies that the corresponding patch @xmath27 is not salient .",
    "[ fig : c2:variance]-a plots the variance of the @xmath33 coefficients of the motorcycle and the background images in the caltech5 database ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : caltech5 ] ) , the @xmath32 patches being learned from the same images . out of the 1000 patches , 200 salient ones whose resulting @xmath33 have non - negligible variance are selected .",
    "other patches usually correspond to nonsalient structures such as a common background and are therefore excluded .",
    "[ fig : c2:variance]-b and c show that after patch selection the 200 @xmath33 coefficients are mainly positioned around the object , as opposed to the 1000 @xmath33 coefficients spreading over all the image prior to patch selection .",
    "the recognition using these salient patches is not only more robust but also 5 times faster .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "inspired by the biologically motivated work of  @xcite , we have described a wavelet - based algorithm which can compete with the state - of - the - art methods for fast and robust object recognition , texture and satellite image classification , language recognition and sound classification .",
    "a feedback procedure has been introduced to improve recognition performance in multiple - object scenes .",
    "potential applications also include video archiving ( semantic video analysis ) , video surveillance , high - throughput drug development , texture retrieval , and robotic learning by imitation .    to further improve and extend the algorithm , a key aspect will be a more refined use of feedback between different levels .",
    "such feedback will naturally involve stability and convergence questions , which will in turn both guide the design of the algorithm and shape its performance .",
    "in addition , contrary to the nervous system , the algorithm need not be constrained by information transmission delays between different levels .",
    "preliminary ideas in this direction are briefly discussed in the appendix .",
    "+    * appendix *",
    "the first step towards introducing a dynamic systems perspective aimed at further development of feedback mechanisms is simply to rewrite the algorithm in terms of differential equations , which puts it in a form more suitable to subsequent analysis of stability and convergence .                with spike amplitude equal to @xmath46 @xmath47",
    "the function @xmath48 is discussed later in this section and in a companion paper .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath49 can be modified in turn so that states corresponding to each object appear in sequence according to the state @xmath50          where , componentwise , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is active and and @xmath55 otherwise .",
    "note that @xmath50 smoothly transitions between @xmath56 and @xmath46 according to the attended object .",
    "the positive gain @xmath57 is chosen such that @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the spike duration , itself a fraction of the interspike period .",
    "techniques for globally stable spike - based clustering are described in a companion paper , based on modified fitzhugh - nagumo neural oscillators  @xcite , similar to  @xcite , @xmath60\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the membrane potential of the oscillator , @xmath62 is an internal state variable representing gate voltage , @xmath63 represents the external current input , and @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are strictly positive constants . using a diagonal metric transformation @xmath67",
    ", one easily shows , similarly to  @xcite , that          one of the most immediate additional feedback mechanisms to be explored is that of generalized diffusive connections ( @xcite , section 3.1.2 ) . in a feedback hierarchy , these correspond to achieving consensus between multiple processes of different dimensions .",
    "similarly to  @xcite , composite variables for dynamic tracking can be used at every level , based on both top - down an bottom - up information .",
    "this allows one to implicitly introduce time - derivatives of signals in the differential equations , without having to measure or compute these terms explicitly .",
