    "emission lines of be - like ions are widely detected in a variety of astrophysical plasmas , including the solar transition region and corona , with the prominent ions including c iii , o v , ca xvii and fe xxiii  see for example , the chianti database at http://www.chiantidatabase.org/ and the _ atomic line list _",
    "( v2.04 ) of peter van hoof at @xmath2 .",
    "many of the observed lines are sensitive to variations in density or temperature , and hence are useful as diagnostics ",
    "see for example , @xcite .",
    "however , for the reliable modelling of plasmas , accurate atomic data are required , particularly for energy levels , radiative rates ( a - values ) , and excitation rates or equivalently the effective collision strengths ( @xmath0 ) , which are obtained from the electron impact collision strengths ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "unfortunately , existing atomic data for be - like ions prior to 2014 were very limited , particularly for @xmath0 .",
    "however , very recently @xcite have reported data for a range of be - like ions up to z = 36 . for their calculations",
    "they have adopted the _ autostructure _ ( as ) code of @xcite for the generation of wave functions , i.e. to determine energy levels and a - values . in the subsequent calculations of @xmath3 and @xmath0",
    "they have adopted the @xmath1-matrix code of @xcite .",
    "their @xmath3 are primarily obtained in the @xmath4 coupling ( russell - saunders or spin - orbit coupling ) and corresponding results for _ fine - structure _ transitions are determined through their intermediate coupling frame transformation ( icft ) method .",
    "assessing atomic data , particularly for @xmath0 , is a difficult task @xcite mainly because the calculations are highly complicated , require large computational resources and can not be easily repeated .",
    "therefore , the assessment is frequently based on limited comparisons either with already available results or with simple calculations , such as with the _ distorted - wave _ method but without resonances . however , often such accuracy assessments are far from satisfactory as noted by @xcite for several ions .    [ cols=\">,<,<,>,>,>,<,<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     darc : present results from the darc code + icft : results of @xcite +    for all ions the lowest 98 levels belonging to the 17 configurations ( namely ( 1s@xmath5 ) 2@xmath62@xmath7 , 2@xmath63@xmath7 and 2@xmath64@xmath7 ) have been considered . as stated earlier , for the calculations of @xmath3 we adopted the darc code .",
    "specific details of the calculations are available in @xcite for al x , @xcite for cl xiv , k xvi and ge xxix , and @xcite for ti xix .",
    "briefly , all partial waves with angular momentum @xmath8 40.5 have been considered , and to ensure convergence of @xmath3 for all transitions and at all energies a ",
    "top - up \" based on the coulomb - bethe @xcite and geometric series approximations was included for the allowed and forbidden transitions , respectively .",
    "furthermore , values of @xmath3 were determined up to a wide range of energies up to 380 ryd ( al x ) , 660 ryd ( cl xiv ) , 780 ryd ( k xvi ) , 1150 ryd ( ti xix ) and 2500 ryd ( ge xxix ) .",
    "for the subsequent calculations of @xmath0 , resonances in a fine energy mesh ( 0.001 ryd for most threshold regions ) were resolved and averaged over a _ maxwellian _ distribution of electron velocities .",
    "this distribution is commonly used and is appropriate for most astrophysical applications .",
    "the density and importance of resonances for be - like ions can be appreciated from figs .",
    "611 of @xcite for a few transitions of ti xix .",
    "results for @xmath0 were obtained over a wide range of electron temperatures ( t@xmath9 ) fully covering that of their maximum fractional abundance in ionisation equilibrium @xcite .",
    "specifically , @xmath0 were reported up to log t@xmath9 = 7.2 ( al x ) , 7.5 ( cl xiv ) , 7.5 ( k xvi ) , 7.7 ( ti xix ) and 7.8 k ( ge xxix ) .    @xcite adopted the as code of @xcite to calculate energy levels and a - values .",
    "their calculations are comparatively larger as they included 238 _ fine - structure _ levels of the ( 1s@xmath5 ) 2(s , p ) @xmath10 ( @xmath11 = 37 , @xmath6 = 04 for @xmath125 and @xmath6 = 02 for @xmath11 = 67 ) configurations . for",
    "most be - like ions considered , their semi - relativistic approach generally yields comparable results with grasp for energy levels and a - values .",
    "for example , in table 1 we list the two sets of energies for the lowest 80 levels of al x , where discrepancies are less than 0.02 ryd and level orderings are also the same . since detailed comparisons of energy levels with available experimental and other theoretical results have already been made by us and @xcite , we do not discuss these further .",
    "similarly , we do not discuss the a - values , and rather focus on the more important parameter , i.e. @xmath0 .",
    "for the determination of @xmath3 , @xcite obtained results for fine - structure transitions from the @xmath4 calculations @xcite through the icft approach .",
    "they considered a slightly larger range of partial waves ( @xmath8 44.5 ) than ourselves .",
    "however , they only included electron _",
    "exchange _ up to @xmath13 = 11.5 and for the rest performed a no - exchange calculation for expediency .",
    "this approach sometimes leads to sudden changes ( at the overlap point ) in the variation of @xmath3 with @xmath13  see for example , table 6 of @xcite .",
    "however , for most transitions it should not be a significant source of inaccuracy .",
    "more importantly , @xcite performed their calculations of @xmath3 for limited energy ranges , namely up to 90 ryd ( al x ) , 165 ryd ( cl xiv ) , 215 ryd ( k xvi ) , 300 ryd ( ti xix ) and 680 ryd ( ge xxix ) , lower by a factor of @xmath14 4 compared to our work .",
    "unfortunately , such energy ranges are insufficient @xcite to determine values of @xmath0 at the high temperatures ( up to @xmath14 1.7@xmath1510@xmath16 k or equivalently @xmath14 10,600 ryd ) for which these authors reported results .",
    "they did include high energy contributions to @xmath3 from the suggested formulae of @xcite , but this approach , although computationally highly efficient , is perhaps a major source of inaccuracy , as discussed earlier by us for transitions of fe xiv @xcite .",
    "since we had already calculated values of @xmath3 up to sufficiently high energies , there was no need for extrapolation to determine @xmath0 for the ranges of t@xmath9 reported by us .",
    "@xcite resolved resonances in the threshold regions and averaged the values of @xmath3 over a maxwellian distribution of electron velocities to determine @xmath0 , in a similar procedure to that employed by us .",
    "however , within thresholds they adopted a uniform mesh of 0.00001 z@xmath5 , where z is the _ reduced _ charge of the ion , i.e. z4 .",
    "consequently , with increasing z their adopted energy mesh becomes coarser .",
    "for example , for al x it is 0.00081 ryd , but for ge xxix is 0.0078 ryd .",
    "furthermore , this energy mesh was adopted only for partial waves with @xmath8 11.5 ( i.e. for the exchange calculations only ) , while for higher @xmath13 the mesh was coarser by a factor of 100 , i.e. 0.001 z@xmath5 . by contrast",
    ", we adopted a uniform mesh ( @xmath14 0.001 ryd ) for _ all _ partial waves and for all ions .",
    "since @xcite have not reported results for @xmath3 no direct comparisons with our work are possible .",
    "therefore , we focus on a comparison of @xmath0 , which are normally required for modelling applications .      in table 2",
    "we list both sets of results for @xmath0 for the resonance transitions of al x among the lowest 80 levels which have the same orderings in both calculations , and at three electron temperatures , i.e. log t@xmath9 = 4.3 , 6.0 and 7.3 k. the first and the third are the lowest and the highest _ common _ temperatures between the two calculations , whereas the second is the most relevant for modelling applications , because 10@xmath17 k is the temperature at which al x has its maximum abundance in ionisation equilibrium @xcite .    for most transitions listed in table 2 ,",
    "the @xmath0 of @xcite are larger , by up to a factor of 15 , at all temperatures , particularly the lower ones . however , for some transitions our results are higher by up to a factor of 2 , such as 126/27/28 ( i.e. 2s@xmath5 @xmath18s@xmath19  2p3p @xmath20d@xmath21 ) .",
    "these transitions are _ forbidden _ in both the ls and @xmath22 coupling schemes , and hence resonances for these are significant ( particularly towards the lower end of the energy range ) as shown in fig . 1 for 2s@xmath5 @xmath18s@xmath19  2p3p @xmath20d@xmath23 ( 126 ) .",
    "we note that even a slight shift in resonance positions can affect the calculated values of @xmath0 , particularly at low(er ) temperatures . however , as shown in table 1 the two sets of energies obtained by the as and grasp codes are comparable for most levels , including 2p3p @xmath20d@xmath21 .",
    "if these near threshold resonances are missing from the calculations of @xcite then their results for @xmath0 will clearly be lower .    among the transitions for which @xmath24 are larger than @xmath25 at log t@xmath9 = 4.3 k ,",
    "are 164 ( 2s@xmath5 @xmath18s@xmath19",
    " 2p4s @xmath18p@xmath26 ) and 180 ( 2s@xmath5 @xmath18s@xmath19 ",
    "2p4f @xmath18f@xmath27 ) , which are allowed and forbidden , respectively .",
    "the 164 transition is weak with f = 5@xmath1510@xmath28 in our work ( grasp ) and f = 1@xmath1510@xmath28 from as , and yet @xmath24 @xmath29 @xmath25 by a factor of @xmath14 6 at the lowest common temperature , while @xmath24 is smaller by a factor of 2 at log t@xmath9 = 7.3 k. for this transition , resonances are not prominent as expected .",
    "similarly , for the 180 ( forbidden ) transition we do not observe any significant resonances , although @xcite may do so , because their calculations include 238 levels in comparison to only 98 in ours .",
    "therefore , we now focus our attention on the highest temperature of 10@xmath30 k ( equivalent to @xmath14 126 ryd ) at which the contributions of resonances , if any , will not be appreciable .    among the transitions listed in table 2 , the one which shows the largest factor ( 4 ) by which @xmath24 is higher than @xmath25 is 170 ( 2s@xmath5 @xmath18s@xmath19",
    " 2p4p @xmath20p@xmath19 ) .",
    "in fact , the difference between the two calculations increases with increasing temperature ( from a factor of 2.6 at t@xmath9 = 10@xmath31 k to 4.1 at 10@xmath30 k ) .",
    "however , this is a forbidden transition for which @xmath3 decreases ( or becomes nearly constant ) with increasing energy  see table 4 of @xcite . therefore , the behaviour of @xmath0 in the calculations of @xcite is difficult to understand for some transitions .",
    "the comparisons of @xmath0 shown in table 2 are for a very limited range of transitions .",
    "therefore , in fig . 2 ( a , b and c ) we compare the two sets of @xmath0 for all 3160 transitions among the 80 levels of al x at three temperatures of table 2 .",
    "it is clear from these figures that for a majority of transitions the @xmath0 of @xcite are significantly larger ( by up to a factor of 30 ) at all temperatures .",
    "more specifically , for 69% and 42% of the transitions the two sets of @xmath0 differ by over 20% at the lowest and the highest common temperatures of 10@xmath31 and 10@xmath30 k , respectively .",
    "also , for a majority of transitions the values of @xmath24 are larger . a similar comparison is found for transitions in other ions , namely cl xiv , k xvi , ti xix and ge xxix .",
    "we now discuss the discrepancies between the two sets of @xmath0 for specific range of transitions . among the lowest 10 levels",
    "are 45 transitions belonging to the @xmath11 = 2 configurations . at t@xmath9",
    "= 10@xmath31 k , for @xmath14 30% of transitions discrepancies are up to a factor of 2.5 , largest for the 46 : 2s2p @xmath20p@xmath32  2p@xmath5 @xmath20p@xmath19 , which is forbidden .",
    "for half the transitions @xmath25",
    "@xmath29 @xmath24 and for the other half @xmath24 @xmath29 @xmath25 , and there are no systematics because both types ( allowed and forbidden ) show the discrepancies .",
    "this may be due to the position of resonances , as discussed in section 3.1 , because at t@xmath9 = 10@xmath33 and 10@xmath30 k both sets of @xmath0 agree within @xmath1420% .",
    "there are 630 transitions among the @xmath11 = 3 configurations belonging to the levels between 11 and 46 .",
    "at t@xmath9 = 10@xmath31 and 10@xmath33 k for about half the transitions ( including both allowed and forbidden ) @xmath25 @xmath29 @xmath24 , whereas a third of transitions have @xmath24 @xmath29 @xmath25 at t@xmath9 = 10@xmath30 k. it is difficult to explain these discrepancies at all temperatures , particularly for the allowed transitions .",
    "these transitions belong to levels 47 and higher and are 561 in number . for a majority of transitions ( about two third ) @xmath24 @xmath29 @xmath25 at _ all _ temperatures .",
    "again , these large discrepancies are difficult to understand , particularly at t@xmath9 = 10@xmath30 k and for allowed transitions .",
    "nevertheless , we will return to the source of discrepancies in section 4 , apart from those already discussed in section 2 .",
    "we now discuss the _ strong _ allowed transitions , i.e. with f @xmath34 0.1 . among the lowest 80 levels of al x given in table 1",
    ", there are 79 such transitions . at the most relevant temperature of al x ( i.e. 10@xmath35 k )",
    "both sets of @xmath0 agree within @xmath1420% for all transitions , but for about a third @xmath24 @xmath29 @xmath25 at t@xmath9 = 10@xmath31 and 10@xmath30 k. discrepancies are comparatively larger at the lowest common temperature and many transitions belong to the lowest 46 levels of the @xmath11 = 2 and 3 configurations .      finally , we note that the comparison shown by @xcite in their fig .",
    "5 with the @xmath0 of @xcite for the 2s@xmath5 @xmath18s@xmath19  2s2p @xmath20p@xmath26 ( 13 ) transition of p xii is incorrect . for this transition",
    "there is no appreciable difference between the @xmath0 interpolated by @xcite and those calculated by @xcite .",
    "in fact , for this transition the interpolated values for other ions are underestimated ( by up to a factor of two ) , rather than overestimated as shown by @xcite .",
    "this can be seen from table 6 of @xcite for al x , and tables 16 and 17 of @xcite for cl xiv and k xvi .",
    "the error in calculating @xmath0 has occurred by @xcite because they have mistakenly taken the coefficient @xmath361 to be positive rather than negative ( @xmath361 = 0.026314 ) , as given by @xcite in his table ii .",
    "in this paper we have compared two sets of electron impact excitation effective collision strength ( @xmath0 ) for transitions in be - like ions obtained by the @xmath1-matrix method in semi and fully relativistic approaches , i.e. icft and darc .",
    "both approaches should provide comparable results for a majority of transitions .",
    "however , significant differences of up to more than an order of magnitude are noted for at least 50% of the transitions of all ions with 13 @xmath37 32 , and over the entire range of electron temperature . in most cases",
    "the @xmath0 from icft are significantly larger than those obtained with darc .",
    "we believe the discrepancies have arisen mainly due to some compromises made by @xcite in calculating @xmath3 and subsequently @xmath0 , as noted in section 2 .",
    "similar large discrepancies between the two independent @xmath1-matrix approaches have also been noted in the past  see for example , @xcite for fe xiv , @xcite and references therein for he - like and @xcite for li - like ions .",
    "therefore , it appears that the implementation of the icft approach , although computationally highly efficient ( hence allowing data for many ions to be produced over relatively short periods ) , may not be completely robust .",
    "indeed , this has also been confirmed by @xcite in their calculations for o iii , who noted that for some transitions the icft results can be significantly overestimated in comparison to the breit - pauli ( or other similar approaches , such as darc ) .",
    "therefore , we recommend that the excitation rates reported by @xcite should be used with caution and a re - examination of their results would be helpful .    as already stated in section 1 , assessing the accuracy of @xmath0 is a difficult task @xcite , mainly because large calculations can not be easily reproduced .",
    "however , when two ( or more ) calculations of comparable complexity and with similar approaches ( such as @xmath1-matrix ) become available , the discrepancies observed are often striking , as noted above for he - like , li - like and be - like ions .",
    "therefore , the true accuracy of any atomic data can only be assessed either by modelling applications or the comparisons , as shown in this work . however , since observational data are generally limited , a comparison with theoretical results is often inconclusive .",
    "the large discrepancies in @xmath0 observed here for a majority of transitions of many be - like ions do create suspicion in the minds of users .",
    "nevertheless , as discussed in our published papers , our accuracy assessment for a majority of transitions in the temperature ranges of interest remains the same , i.e. @xmath1420% . although no accuracy assessment has been made by @xcite , their reported data would appear to be less reliable due to the compromises made in their calculations particularly in the chosen energy mesh and the energy ranges over which values of @xmath3 were calculated before extrapolation .",
    "however , we also stress that there is scope for improvement in our work ( as there is for any calculation ) , especially for transitions involving levels of the @xmath11 = 4 configurations .",
    "the inclusion of levels of the @xmath38 5 configurations in the collisional calculations may improve the reported values of @xmath0 due to the additional resonances arising .",
    "however , until then we believe that our reported results for radiative and excitation rates for transitions in be - like ions are ( probably ) the most exhaustive and accurate available to date , and should be useful for the modelling of astrophysical plasmas .",
