    "viii ) , there exists a constant @xmath10 depending only on the hyperplanes and the dimension @xmath11 such that if @xmath3 is a holomorphic map from the unit disc to @xmath1 which omits the hyperplanes @xmath12 then @xmath13 where @xmath5 denotes the norm of the derivative of @xmath3 with respect to the fubini - study metric on @xmath1 and can be defined by @xmath14 where @xmath15 for some choice of homogeneous coordinate functions for @xmath16 in modern terms ( see for instance @xcite or @xcite ) , dufresnoy s theorem says that the complement of @xmath0 hyperplanes in general position in @xmath1 is complete hyperbolic and hyperbolically embedded in @xmath17    in @xcite , dufresnoy remarks that the constant @xmath2 depends on the hyperplanes @xmath18 in a `` completely unknown '' way .",
    "our purpose is to give an explicit estimate for the constant @xmath19 and therefore an explicit lower bound on the ratio of the infinitesimal kobayashi metric ( a.  k.  a.  royden s function @xcite ) on the hyperplane complement as compared to the fubini - study metric on projective space .    to that end , let @xmath20 $ ] be homogeneous coordinates on @xmath7 and let @xmath21 be @xmath9 hyperplanes in general position in @xmath1 given by linear defining forms @xmath22 normalized such that @xmath23 consider the @xmath24-matrix @xmath25 and let @xmath26 be the @xmath9 eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath27 listed in non - decreasing order .",
    "we then define the following quantities : @xmath28    we can now state our main theorem as    let @xmath29 be @xmath0 hyperplanes in general position in @xmath17 let @xmath30 and @xmath31 let @xmath32 be the binomial coefficient @xmath33 and @xmath34 let @xmath3 be a holomorphic map from the unit disc @xmath35 to @xmath1 omitting @xmath36 then , @xmath37    when @xmath38 the classical theorem of landau @xcite gives effective upper bounds , and very good bounds were obtained in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "it seems difficult to adapt this method to the case of @xmath0 omitted hyperplanes , except of course for @xmath42 when they are the same . for arbitrary @xmath11",
    "there is also a negative curvature approach of babets @xcite , @xcite , but babets s estimates involve higher order derivatives or higher associated curves .    in this paper , we obtain an explicit estimate by putting in a quantitative form the argument from @xcite , where another proof of dufresnoy s theorem was given .",
    "the proof in @xcite was based on potential - theoretic considerations which also give a form of the second main theorem for holomorphic curves @xcite .",
    "a survey of other results obtained with this method is @xcite .    to prove our main result we combine the method of @xcite with two new ingredients .",
    "the first one is a quantitative form of the uniqueness theorem for harmonic functions in the form of a generalization of the three circles theorem of hadamard by nadirashvili @xcite .",
    "the second ingredient is theorem  [ derivthm ] , which gives an estimate for @xmath43 in terms of the fubini ",

    "as we discussed in the introduction , the kobayashi metric on the complement of the hyperplanes @xmath18 is a metric , so theorem  [ landauthm ] can be interpreted as a global lower - bound over this hyperplane complement on the ratio of the infinitesimal kobayashi metric to the infinitesimal fubini - study metric .",
    "unfortunately , our method does not give any information in terms of the geometry of the omitted hyperplanes on where the minimum ratio occurs .",
    "for geometrically symmetric hyperplane configurations , one could hope to determine these minimum points .",
    "this was done in the one - dimensional case in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that the dependence on @xmath355 in theorem  [ landauthm ] is essentially best possible .",
    "indeed , consider @xmath44 and consider the points @xmath356 @xmath114 and @xmath357 for @xmath114 large .",
    "then the map @xmath358 omits the three points provided @xmath359 then , @xmath360 approaches @xmath361 as @xmath195 approaches @xmath362 because we have included @xmath108 and @xmath357 among our three points , @xmath363 in this case .",
    "a straightforward computation shows that @xmath364 an easy application of lhpital s rule also shows that @xmath365 and hence the linear appearance of @xmath355 in the inequality in theorem  [ landauthm ] is correct .",
    "of course the enormous constant in front is not optimal .",
    "now consider the case where the three points are @xmath366 @xmath367 and @xmath357 for @xmath114 large . in this case",
    "bonk and cherry @xcite gave a sharp upper bound on @xmath368 if @xmath369 denotes the universal covering map of which sends @xmath108 to @xmath356 then the map @xmath370 has the largest spherical derivative at the origin in comparison with all maps omitting @xmath366 @xmath371 and @xmath372 one can even compute using schwarz triangle functions that @xmath373 one sees as above that here @xmath355 is asymptotic to @xmath374 as @xmath375 and that @xmath376 is asymptotic to @xmath366 and thus , the hyperplane dependence through the term @xmath376 is also not too bad .",
    "the appearance of the combinatorial coefficient @xmath32 in the exponent of our estimate causes the estimate to deteriorate rather severely as the dimension @xmath199 increases .",
    "it would be interesting to find out if there must be some dependence on @xmath199 in the estimate beyond the fact that @xmath355 depends implicitly on @xmath377 the appearance of this combinatorial constant also prevents our method from giving a better bound when @xmath3 omits more than @xmath0 hyperplanes . if @xmath3 omits more than @xmath0 hyperplanes , the best estimate our method gives is to choose the @xmath0 hyperplanes that give the best @xmath355 from among the omitted hyperplanes .",
    "this is clearly a deficiency in our approach . for maps to @xmath1 omitting @xmath378 hyperplanes",
    ", it would be nice to prove an estimate that improves as @xmath378 increases , as in ( * ? ? ?",
