    "considerable attention in recent years was devoted to the study of error correction with codes on graphs . in this paper",
    "we are interested in estimating the number of errors correctable with codes on graphs constructed as generalizations of ldpc codes .",
    "ldpc codes are constructed on a bipartite graph @xmath0 by associating code s coordinates with the vertices in one part of @xmath1 , replicating the values of each vertex on the edges incident to it , and imposing a parity - check constraint at each vertex of the other part of @xmath1 .",
    "the generalization that we have in mind is concerned with replacing the repetition and single - parity - check codes as local codes at the graph s vertices with other error - correcting codes",
    ".    error correction with codes on graphs has been studied along two lines , namely , by computing the average number of errors correctable with some decoding algorithm by codes from a certain random ensemble of graph codes , or by examining explicit code families whose construction involves graphs with a large spectral gap .",
    "the first direction originates in the works of gallager @xcite and zyablov and pinsker @xcite who showed that random ldpc codes of growing length can correct a nonvanishing fraction of errors .",
    "recently the decoding algorithm of @xcite was studied by burshtein @xcite who derived an improved estimate of the number of correctable errors compared to @xcite and by zyablov et al .",
    "@xcite who provided estimates of the number of errors under the assumption of local single error - correcting ( hamming ) codes .",
    "the second line of work , initiated in tanner s paper @xcite and in sipser and spielman s @xcite , pursues estimates of error correction with codes on regular graphs with a small second eigenvalue and ensuing expansion properties .",
    "presently it is known that such codes under iterative decoding can correct the number of errors equal to a half of the designed distance of graph codes @xcite .",
    "this estimate fits in a series of analogous results for various `` concatenated '' coding schemes and has prompted a view of graph codes as parallel concatenations of the local codes @xcite .",
    "however , this result relies on certain restrictive assumptions discussed below .",
    "an extension of tanner s construction from graphs to hypergraphs was proposed by bilu and hoory @xcite who showed that such codes ( for high code rates ) can have minimum distance greater than the best known bipartite - graph constructions .",
    "interestingly , the codes considered in @xcite are a direct extension of a construction in @xcite in the same way as tanner s graph codes extend ldpc codes .",
    "as is well known , graphs with high expansion and random graphs share many properties that can be used to prove estimates of error correction .",
    "this similarity in the coding theory context was emphasized in our recent work @xcite where we showed that ensembles of codes on random graphs and explicit expander - like constructions share many common features such as properties of the minimum distance and weight distribution .    regarding the proportion of errors corrected by graph codes under iterative decoding , we note one difference between ( generalized ) ldpc codes on random graphs and explicit constructions based on the graph spectrum .",
    "the explicit constructions based on regular graphs depend on the difference between the largest and the second largest eigenvalue of the graph ( the `` spectral gap '' ) . for this reason , one",
    "is forced to rely on local codes with rather large minimum distance @xmath2 , for instance , @xmath2 greater than the square root of the degree @xmath3 of the graph . even though in the construction of @xcite and later works @xmath3 is kept constant , this",
    "effectively rules out of consideration local codes with small minimum distance such as the hamming codes and the like .",
    "the square root restriction is implied by the spectral gap of regular bipartite graphs , and is the best possible owing to the alon - boppana bound for graph spectra @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to lift this limitation on the distance @xmath2 by switching from graphs with a large spectral gap to random graphs .    in this paper",
    "we obtain new estimates of the number of correctable errors for random ensembles of bipartite - graph and hypergraph codes under iterative decoding .",
    "the first part of the paper is devoted to codes on regular bipartite graphs . to construct long graph codes , we assume that the degree of the graph is fixed and the number of vertices in both parts approaches infinity . assuming that local constraint codes are used to correct 2 or more errors , we show that almost all codes in the ensemble of graph codes are capable of correcting all error patterns of weight that forms a constant fraction of the code length .",
    "this is a much less restrictive assumption on the local codes than the one taken in earlier works on decoding of graph codes @xcite .",
    "the proof of this result employs some ideas of @xcite introduced there for the analysis of the weight distribution of graph codes .",
    "we then observe that if the degree of the graph is allowed to increase then graph codes with local codes of constant distance do not correct a linearly growing number of errors under the proposed iterative decoding .",
    "this motivates us to study graph codes with long local codes correcting a growing number of errors that forms a fixed proportion of the degree .",
    "the results obtained in this case parallel earlier theorems for product codes and graph codes based on the spectral gap .",
    "in the second part of the paper we establish similar results for codes on hypergraphs , showing that a constant proportion of errors is corrected by an iterative decoding algorithm that combines some ideas of @xcite with the results proved for codes on bipartite graphs in the first part of the paper . constructing the code ensemble based on regular hypergraphs of a fixed degree ,",
    "we show that they contain codes capable of correcting a constant proportion of errors .",
    "the proof involves no assumptions on the distance of the local codes ; in particular , we show that networks of hamming codes correct a fixed proportion of errors under iterative decoding .",
    "this fact was previously proved by tanner @xcite under the assumption that the underlying graph is a tree .",
    "this assumption is not needed in our results . as in the case of the graph ensemble",
    ", we also perform the analysis of the decoding algorithm for the case of growing degree , finding the proportion of errors correctable with hypergraph codes based on long local codes .",
    "this paper is dedicated to the memory of ralf koetter .",
    "the first - named author discussed the problem of estimating the performance of codes on graphs with ralf in the beginning of 2004 .",
    "ralf s idea at that point was to investigate the error correcting capability of codes defined on some distance - regular graph , with local constraints imposed at the vertices of the graph .",
    "presently it is understood that the setting most amenable to analysis is that of codes defined on a regular bipartite graph .",
    "ralf himself made an initial attempt to analyze such codes in a joint paper with xiangyu tang @xcite .",
    "the emphasis in @xcite is on the estimation of the largest channel error rate tolerated by graph codes under such decoding . in the present paper , similarly to @xcite and later works , the local codes are decoded up to their correction radius guaranteed by the minimum distance .",
