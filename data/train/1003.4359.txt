    "the top quark is by far the heaviest elementary particle observed by particle physics experiments and features a mass of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the large mass of the top quark gives rise to large radiative corrections , for example to the @xmath1 propagator , which causes a strong correlation between @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and the higgs boson mass @xmath4 .",
    "to predict @xmath4 a precise measurement of @xmath3 is crucial .",
    "the large mass leads also to a very short lifetime of the top quark , @xmath5 , such that top hadrons are not formed .",
    "the top quark thus offers the unique possibility to study a quasi - free quark and as a consequence polarization effects are accessible in the angular distributions of top - quark decay products .",
    "since @xmath3 is close to the energy scale at which the electroweak gauge symmetry breaks down ( vacuum expectation value of the higgs field @xmath6 ) , it has been argued that the top quark may be part of a special dynamics causing the break down of the electroweak gauge symmetry  @xcite .",
    "finally , the top quark gives access to the highest energy scales and offers thereby the chance to find new , unexpected physics , for example heavy resonances that decay into @xmath7 pairs .    in the past years the fermilab tevatron , a synchrotron colliding protons and antiprotons at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath8 , was the only place to produce and observe top quarks under laboratory conditions .",
    "physics data taking of tevatron run ii started in 2002 and in the meanwhile the accelerator has delivered collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath9 .",
    "the two general - purpose detectors cdf and dhave recorded collision data corresponding to @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the main source of top quarks at the tevatron is the pair production via the strong interaction . at leading order in perturbation theory ( @xmath12 ) there are two processes that contribute to @xmath7 production , quark - antiquark annihilation @xmath13 and gluon - gluon fusion @xmath14 .",

    "the most important ( or golden ) channel is the so - called _ lepton+jets _ channel where one @xmath1 boson decays leptonically into a charged lepton ( electron or muon ) plus a neutrino , while the second @xmath1 boson decays into jets .",
    "the lepton+jets channel features a large branching ratio of about 29% , manageable backgrounds , and allows for the full reconstruction of the event kinematics .",
    "other accessible channels are the _ dilepton _ channel , in which both @xmath1 bosons decay to leptons , and the _ all - hadronic _ channel , where both @xmath1 bosons decay hadronically .",
    "the dilepton channel has the advantage of having a low background , but suffers on the other hand from a lower branching fraction ( 5% ) compared to the lepton+jets channel .",
    "the all - hadronic channel , on the contrary , has the largest branching ratio of all @xmath7 event categories ( 46% ) , but has the drawback of a huge qcd multijet background , that has to be controlled experimentally .",
    "the different categories of @xmath7 and their branching fractions are summarized in table  [ tab : ttbardecay ] .",

    "the most commonly used algorithm to identify @xmath17-quark jets is based on the reconstruction of secondary vertices in jets , exploiting the relatively long lifetime of @xmath17-hadrons and a large lorentz boost .",
    "the typical decay length of @xmath17-hadrons in high-@xmath22 @xmath17-quark jets is on the order of a few millimeters .",
    "the requirement of a secondary vertex within one of the jets leads to a large reduction of the @xmath1+jets background by roughly a factor of 50 , while the selection efficiency for @xmath7 events is about 50% to 60% .",

    "measurements in the dilepton channel contributed to the discovery of the top quark in the 1990s  @xcite . in run",

    ", analysts at cdf developed a second technique that allows one of the leptons to be measured only as a high-@xmath41 isolated track , thereby significantly increasing the lepton detection efficiency at the cost of a moderate increase in the expected backgrounds .",

    "the fit results are : @xmath175 and @xmath176 , where the statistical and systematic uncertainties have been combined .",
    "the lower limit on @xmath162 is determined to be @xmath177 at the 95% c.l .",
    "two different classes of non - sm top - quark decays have been searched for at the tevatron , decays via flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) and into a charged higgs boson .      in the sm fcnc are not present at tree level , but rather occur only through loop processes in higher orders of perturbation theory . in the top sector",
    "in particular fcnc are strongly suppressed with branching ratios of @xmath178 .",
    "the cdf collaboration has searched for non - sm top quark decays of the type @xmath179 .",
    "top - antitop candidates are reconstructed in events with four high-@xmath41 jets and two isolated leptons using kinematic constraints . within their experimental resolutions determined from simulated events the reconstructed mass of the hadronically decaying @xmath1-boson @xmath180",
    "has to be equal to @xmath2 , the mass of the reconstructed hadronic top quark @xmath181 and the mass of semileptonically decaying top quark @xmath182 has to resemble @xmath3 .",
    "a @xmath183 formed from these conditions is used to determine the most likely combination of physics objects and measure its @xmath7-likeness under the anomalous - decay hypothesis .",
    "a fit to the @xmath184 distribution in combination with a feldman - cousins technique is used to derive an upper limit on the branching ratio : @xmath185 at the 95% c.l .",
    "a previous run i result by cdf also set a limit on fcnc branching ratios in the photon - plus - jet mode : @xmath186  @xcite .      in the sm a single complex higgs doublet scalar field is responsible for breaking the electroweak symmetry and generating the masses of gauge bosons and fermions .",
    "many extensions of the sm include a higgs sector with two higgs doublets and are therefore called two higgs doublet models ( thdm ) . in a thdm electroweak symmetry",
    "breaking leads to five physical higgs bosons : two neutral @xmath187-even scalars @xmath188 and @xmath189 , one neutral @xmath187-odd pseudoscalar @xmath190 , and a pair of charged scalars @xmath191 .",
    "the parameters of the extended higgs sector include the mass of the charged higgs @xmath192 and @xmath193 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values @xmath194 and @xmath195 of the two higgs doublets .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) is an example of a thdm .",
    "if the charged higgs boson is lighter than the difference between top - quark mass and @xmath17-quark mass , @xmath196 , the decay mode @xmath197 is possible and competes with the sm decay @xmath198 .",
    "the branching fraction depends on @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "the mssm predicts that the channel @xmath197 dominates the top - quark decay for @xmath201 . in most analyses",
    "it is assumed that @xmath202 . in the parameter region",
    "@xmath203 the dominant decay mode is @xmath204 , while for @xmath205 the decay channel @xmath206 is the most important one .",
    "for @xmath207 the branching fraction to @xmath208 is nearly 100% .",
    "thus , in this region of parameter space thdm models predict an excess of @xmath7 events with tau leptons over the sm expectation .",
    "first searches for the @xmath191 in top - quark events were already performed well before the top quark was discovered in 1994/95 .",
    "the ua1 and ua2 experiments at the cern @xmath209 excluded certain regions of the @xmath210 versus @xmath211 plane  @xcite .",
    "in run i of the tevatron , cdf and d   improved these limits using events with a dilepton signature  @xcite or reconstructing tau leptons in their hadronic decay mode  @xcite , which is experimentally a very challenging task at a hadron collider . in tevatron run",
    "ii , cdf has added a direct search for a charged higgs boson in the decay channel @xmath204 using the dijet invariant mass as a discriminant  @xcite . in a reanalysis of the @xmath7 candidate samples used for",
    "cross section measurements cdf also considered the decay modes @xmath212 and @xmath213 with @xmath214  @xcite .",
    "the d  collaboration has recently performed direct searches in the lepton@xmath142jets  @xcite and dilepton channels  @xcite , but has also done a simultaneous measurement of the @xmath7 cross section in the lepton@xmath142jets , the dilepton and the @xmath40@xmath142lepton channel , deriving in parallel limits on top - quark decays to a charged higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "so far , there is no evidence for @xmath197 decays .",
    "the resulting limits on the branching ratio @xmath215 depend on @xmath211 and assumptions made on the higgs decays modes , but are typically in the range of 15% to 25% .",
    "large data sets of @xmath7 candidate events are now available to the tevatron collaborations cdf and d  and facilitate precise investigations of top - quark properties .",
    "the @xmath7 production cross section has been measured with a relative precision of 6.5% and is in excellent agreement with qcd predictions  @xcite .",
    "many interesting analyses have searched for physics beyond the sm , for example for resonances decaying into @xmath7 pairs .",
    "the measured forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath7 production shows an intriguing excess which will come under closer scrutiny once more data will be analysed .",
    "the measurements of top - quark decay show impressive progress , for example the measurement of the @xmath1-helicity fractions in top decay .",
    "more detailed reviews on top - quark physics are available on phenomenology  @xcite , tevatron run i results  @xcite , and tevatron run ii results  @xcite .",
