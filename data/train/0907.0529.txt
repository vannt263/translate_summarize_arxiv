    "the predictions of the @xmath0 expansion for baryon masses are in excellent agreement with the experimental values .",
    "however , in comparing with the experimental data , one is restricted to only one value of @xmath4 and to the physical quark mass values .",
    "testing the predictions as a function of light - quark masses and @xmath4 is now possible with very accurate simulations of baryons using lattice qcd .",
    "tremendous progress in lattice qcd has been achieved recently in the simulation of baryon masses using different values of the light - quark masses .",
    "extrapolation of baryon masses on the lattice to the physical point has reproduced the experimental values at the @xmath6 level  @xcite .",
    "the lattice data , however , contain important additional information about the dependence of the baryon masses on the quark masses , which can be utilized .",
    "simulations of baryon masses have been performed as a function of @xmath1 flavor - symmetry breaking ranging from small perturbative flavor - symmetry breaking to large nonperturbative flavor - symmetry breaking .",
    "there are also lattice simulations at different values of @xmath4 ( though not for baryons ) which are able to test @xmath4 scaling rules  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we show that existing lattice simulations ( at @xmath7 ) of the ground state baryon masses already are sufficiently accurate to exhibit and test interesting features of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 flavor - symmetry breaking expansions .",
    "still more accurate simulations are needed to test the most suppressed mass combinations of the @xmath0 expansion , but continued improvements in lattice simulations of baryon masses are expected in the short and long term , so it should eventually be possible to test these relations as well .",
    "we discuss in this paper how present and future lattice data can be utilized to study the spin and flavor structure of baryon masses . although we do not focus on this point here , it should eventually be possible to test the @xmath4 scaling rules in the baryon sector by lattice simulations which vary the number of colors @xmath4 .",
    "an important observation is that the @xmath0 counting rules hold at finite lattice spacing , and so are respected by the lattice results _ including _ the finite lattice spacing corrections dependent on the lattice spacing @xmath8 .",
    "thus the discretization corrections are constrained by the @xmath0 expansion .",

    "there are nonanalytic in @xmath16 contributions from loop corrections which are calculable , as well as analytic terms which depend on low - energy constants ( lecs ) of the chiral lagrangian . in the baryon sector ,",
    "the leading nonanalytic terms are @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath17 term , which arises from fig .",

    "this term is absent for the pseudo - goldstone boson masses , but is present for other mesons such as the vector mesons  @xcite .",
    "a surprising feature of recent lattice results is that the baryon masses as a function of @xmath20 do not show a large @xmath21 dependence .",
    "fits to the baryon masses also give much smaller values for the baryon axial couplings , and require that the @xmath22 term is almost completely cancelled by @xmath18 and @xmath23 terms .",
    "this cancellation must be accidental at the currently accessible lattice quark masses , since the terms have different @xmath16 dependence .",
    "an alternative conclusion is that lattice quark masses are too large for @xmath1 chiral perturbation theory to be valid , and that perturbative chiral behavior sets in only for much smaller quark masses than the strange quark mass .",
    "this conclusion , however , fails to explain why @xmath1 flavor - symmetry is so evident in baryon phenomenology .",
    "the @xmath0 expansion constrains the structure of baryon chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "chiral corrections have to respect the spin - flavor structure of the @xmath0 expansion , and this leads to some important restrictions on the form of the chiral loop corrections .",
    "for example , the baryon mass , which is of order @xmath4  @xcite , gets nonanalytic corrections proportional to @xmath24 , which are large .",
    "this large nonanalytic contribution might lead one to expect that there should be large deviations from the gell - mann  okubo mass relations , which were derived assuming that the mass operator was linear in @xmath11 .",
    "one can show , however , that the @xmath25 terms are a spin - flavor singlet , and give the same contribution to octet and decuplet baryons , whereas the @xmath24 terms are a spin - singlet flavor - octet , and the @xmath26 terms are spin - singlet flavor-@xmath27 .",
    "only the latter terms contribute to the gell - mann  okubo mass combinations , so that deviations from these relations are a factor of @xmath28 smaller than naive expectation and consistent with experiment .",
    "the small size of the gell - mann ",
    "okubo relation was recently confirmed for a range of light - quark masses  @xcite .",
    "for qcd , the cancellation to order @xmath28 arises as a numerical cancellation between octet and decuplet intermediate states  @xcite ; to see the parametric form of the cancellation in @xmath0 requires computing the chiral corrections using the @xmath1 flavor representations of baryons containing @xmath4 quarks .    the mass relations of ref .",
    "@xcite project the baryon masses onto different spin - flavor channels . by studying these mass relations as a function of @xmath16 , one can investigate whether unexpected chiral behavior arises in a particular channel .",

    "@xcite ( from which our numerical data are derived ) , we find that a nlo analysis , which includes the leading nonanalytic mass corrections , returns values of the axial couplings which are significantly smaller than expected from either phenomenology or lattice qcd",
    ". however , the predicted values of the mass relations , as well as the octet and decuplet masses themselves , are in good agreement with experiment .",
    "further , we have shown that the partial inclusion of nnlo mass corrections returns values of the axial couplings @xmath173 and @xmath174 which are consistent with expectations , albeit with large error bars .",
    "unfortunately , the data set we have used in this work is insufficient to precisely constrain all the lecs in the full nnlo analysis .",
    "however , we have demonstrated that a simultaneous extrapolation of both the hyperon axial couplings as well as the @xmath0 mass relations would allow for a rigorous exploration of the predictions and convergence of @xmath1 heavy baryon @xmath170pt .",
    "it is possible , perhaps even likely , that the strange quark is too heavy for the @xmath1 theory to be convergent .",
    "this outcome , however , fails to explain the successes of flavor @xmath1 symmetry observed in nature in the baryon sector .",
    "thus , a detailed study of this phenomena is warranted .",
    "we would like to thank the members of the lhp collaboration for providing their numerical baryon mass data of ref .",
    "awl would like to thank kostas orginos for helpful discussions .",
