    "many top - down supersymmetric constructions contain extra abelian gauge interactions @xcite . since a @xmath0 often couples to both the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) and additional hidden sectors , it is plausible that it plays a role in mediating supersymmetry breaking .",
    "one might refer to such a scenario as @xmath7 mediation .",
    "there are several possibilities for an extra @xmath8 to participate in the mediation of supersymmetry breaking . completely analogous to the vector supermultiplet of the standard model ( sm ) gauge groups",
    ", a @xmath0 can be the mediator of supersymmetry breaking either through gauge mediation @xcite or gaugino mediation @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will use @xmath8 mediation to collectively refer to both possibilities , and give specific qualification when referring to particular realizations .    in a pair of previous works @xcite ,",
    "we have considered a special implementation of such a scenario , in which the @xmath7 gaugino becomes massive as a result of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "although it was referred to as `` @xmath7 mediation '' in @xcite , it can be thought of as a @xmath8-gaugino mediated supersymmetry breaking , and this is the name we will use in this paper gaugino becomes massive was left unspecified in @xcite .",
    "although we refer to this situation as @xmath8-gaugino mediation , the name should _ not _ necessarily imply an underlying extra dimensional model , as in the original gaugino mediation papers @xcite . ] .",
    "a possible realization of this scenario in string theory was subsequently proposed in @xcite .",
    "further applications and realizations of the scenario are discussed in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "extensions of the higgs sector of such a scenario have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "a generic feature of the @xmath1-gaugino mediation scenario is the generation of the soft scalar masses at one - loop order and gaugino masses at two - loop order @xcite .",
    "simple estimates implies that the scalar masses are about 1000 times heavier than the mssm gaugino masses .",
    "since direct searches constrain the gaugino masses to be above @xmath9 gev , it follows that if the mssm gaugino masses are generated by @xmath1-gaugino mediation and are in the range of 100 - 1000 gev , the soft scalar masses are in the range 100 - 1000 tev . to obtain electroweak symmetry breaking at its observed scale , one fine tuning is needed .    in this article , we study the possibility that the effect of @xmath8 mediation can be comparable with some other supersymmetry breaking mediation mechanism . by choosing flavor universal @xmath0 charges , the @xmath8 mediation is naturally flavor diagonal . hence , we would like to narrow our attention to mechanisms with similar properties in order to avoid introducing additional tuning or new flavor protection mechanisms .",
    "typical examples of such mechanisms are gauge mediation @xcite , anomaly mediation @xcite , and gaugino mediation @xcite . combining @xmath8 mediation with gauge mediation or gaugino mediation amounts to straightforward extensions of these scenarios with a larger gauge symmetry .",
    "these scenarios are of phenomenological interest , but we will not pursue them further in this paper . instead , we focus on the possibility of a @xmath8-gaugino mediation that is co - dominant with anomaly mediation ( amsb ) . a model of combining mssm gaugino mediation and anomaly mediation has been proposed in @xcite . by considering the @xmath8 gaugino as a mediator instead , as well as a different underlying model ,",
    "our setup and its phenomenological features are very different .",
    "one immediate question is whether it is natural for these two mechanisms to be comparable . as we will discuss in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : xd ] , such a scenario can be achieved in a large class of models . here , we will instead summarize the main features of the spectrum of soft parameters .",
    "the scale of the soft parameters in both anomaly and @xmath1-gaugino mediation is set by one dimensionful parameter for each mechanism . for @xmath1-gaugino mediation",
    "this parameter is the @xmath1 gaugino mass @xmath10 .",
    "up to order one dimensionless parameters and logarithms of the ratio of the supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking scale @xmath11 to @xmath10 , the soft scalar masses ( @xmath12 ) and the gaugino masses ( @xmath13 ) are given by @xmath14 for amsb the dimensionful parameter is the gravitino mass @xmath15 .",
    "very loosely we can write @xmath16 here , we would like to consider a scenario in which contributions to the soft scalar masses from these two scenarios are comparable . in this case , the positive contribution from @xmath1 gaugino mediation can solve the tachyonic slepton mass problem of anomaly mediation .",
    "the gaugino masses , dominated by anomaly mediation , are also of the same order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , this scenario solves the fine - tuning problem of @xmath1-gaugino mediation .",
    "we demand @xmath17 i.e. , the @xmath1 gaugino mass should be about an order of magnitude smaller than the gravitino mass .",
    "if such a hierarchy holds , the @xmath1 contribution to the mssm gaugino masses is @xmath18 i.e. , three order of magnitude suppressed compared to the anomaly contribution and completely negligible .",
    "again , we will leave the question of whether such a mild hierarchy between the @xmath1 gaugino and the gravitino mass can be realized naturally in models to the discussion in section [ sec : xd ] .    as an immediate consequence of having comparable contributions to the scalar masses from @xmath8-gaugino and anomaly mediation",
    ", the tachyonic slepton problem of pure anomaly mediation is overcome .",
    "another challenge in anomaly mediation is to obtain the correct ratio of @xmath19 . in the scenario with a @xmath0 ,",
    "it is natural to consider a next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) - like scenario where a tree level @xmath2 term is forbidden by @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "this includes most of the supersymmetric @xmath0 models other than those based on @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath0 gauge symmetry breaking , the effective @xmath2 and @xmath21 parameters , and electroweak symmetry breaking are all generated dynamically .",
    "although not necessarily a natural solution for the @xmath22 problem , we found that it is not difficult to find model points which admit successful electroweak symmetry breaking .    adding additional @xmath0 contributions to anomaly mediation has been considered before in the literature @xcite , including the possibility of combining anomaly and @xmath1 mediation in the context of @xmath23  @xcite",
    "however , our scenario is different either in the way the @xmath0 contribution arises , how the @xmath22 problem is addressed , or in our consideration of the issue of generating the hierarchy between the gravitino and the @xmath1 gaugino mass from microscopic considerations .",
    "the structure of the rest of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : xd ]",
    "we discuss how the required hierarchy between the gravitino and the @xmath1 gaugino can be obtained in extra - dimensional models . in section [ sec",
    ": general ] we discuss in general terms a specific implementation of the joint scenario , combining anomaly mediation with the model described in the original @xmath1-mediation papers . in section [ sec : numerical ] we present the detailed spectrum for two illustrative points in parameter space . in section [ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "most of the detailed expressions are relegated to the appendices .",
    "in this section we will show that the mild hierarchy between the @xmath1 gaugino and the gravitino can be obtained if we consider an extra - dimensional implementation of the model .",
    "we begin with a setup used in the original proposal of gaugino mediation @xcite .",
    "we assume there is only one flat extra dimension , @xmath24 $ ] , where the mssm matter fields are localized at @xmath25 , and the hidden sector responsible for the supersymmetry breaking is localized on a spatially separated brane at @xmath26 . unlike the standard gaugino mediation , we assume that the mssm gauge supermultiplets are localized together with the matter fields on the brane at @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath1 gaugino , on the other hand , propagates in the bulk .",
    "therefore , a @xmath1 gaugino mass is generated via a direct coupling to the hidden sector brane , while the @xmath27 gauginos remain massless at tree level or their mass arises from a higher order term .",
    "there are several possible couplings between the @xmath8 and the fields on the hidden sector brane .",
    "we consider the simplest possibility , a brane localized term of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the @xmath30 field strength , @xmath31 is the field whose @xmath32 component generates the gaugino mass , @xmath33 is the size of the extra dimension , @xmath34 is the 5d planck mass and @xmath35 is a constant .",
    "the 5d and the 4d planck masses are related by @xmath36 .    when the field @xmath31 develops an @xmath32 term , a @xmath1 gaugino mass is generated , @xmath37 where the extra factor of @xmath33 arises from the fact that the wave function of the zero mode of the @xmath1 gaugino is spread over the extra dimension .",
    "the gravitino mass is of the order @xmath38 if we assume that @xmath32 and @xmath39 are comparable , we have @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the ratio of the gravitino to the @xmath1 gaugino mass defined in eq .  [ eq : ratio ] .",
    "this product of the 5d planck mass and the size of the extra dimension is constrained both from above and below .",
    "naive dimensional analysis @xcite relates the compactification scale @xmath42 and the cut - off @xmath43 as @xcite @xmath44 one of the central ingredients of anomaly mediation and gaugino mediation is to suppress contact terms of the form @xmath45 with @xmath46 hidden ( visible ) sector fields , which can potentially violate flavor constraints .",
    "this is the so - called sequestering .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that locality in the extra dimension can gives rise to exponential suppression @xmath47 .",
    "taking @xmath48 , the constraints on first two generation flavor changing neutral currents lead to @xcite @xmath49 the conditions in eq .",
    "[ eq : upper ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : lower ] imply that @xmath50 as we have discussed in the previous section , we need @xmath51 for @xmath1-gaugino mediation and anomaly mediation to give comparable contributions to the soft scalar masses . with an order one coefficient in eq .",
    "[ eq : brane ] we can easily generate the appropriate mass hierarchy .    we remark that the actual extra - dimensional model is likely to have additional structure . in particular , it has been argued @xcite that warped compactification could be necessary for successful sequestering",
    ".    we will not go into details of building a realization of our scenario in a warped space .",
    "we only comment that most of the relevant features of the flat extra - dimensional model do not change significantly since they are mainly determined by the physics below the compactification scale .",
    "the phenomenological study presented later in this paper begins with a general parameterization of the boundary condition of supersymmetry breaking , and is not specific to any particular kind of compactification .",
    "we would like to make a more detailed comparison with the scenario studied in ref .",
    "in addition to anomaly mediation , mssm gauginos are employed as the mediators of supersymmetry breaking . in that case , operators of the form of eq .",
    "[ eq : brane ] , with obvious substitution of the @xmath8 field strength superfield with the corresponding ones for the mssm gauge fields , give the dominant contributions to the mssm gauginos in comparison with the anomaly mediation contribution , unless @xmath52 which is difficult to realize . to avoid that , such a coupling has to be absent and additional higher - order interactions lead to comparable contributions from gaugino mediation and anomaly mediation . in our case , while the operator of eq .",
    "[ eq : brane ] gives the dominant contribution to the @xmath8 gaugino mass , our key requirement is that the contributions to the scalar mass are comparable .",
    "as we have already seen , this is a much milder condition and easy to satisfy .",
    "the mssm gaugino masses are then almost completely determined by anomaly mediation .",
    "we also emphasize that the scenario we have presented in this section is a specific implementation of the more general @xmath1-gaugino mediation scenario of @xcite , and the two are not equivalent .",
    "in general , we can consider a different scenario of @xmath8 gauge mediation , in which the @xmath8 couples to a messenger sector and the boundary condition is different from eq .",
    "[ eq : brane ] .",
    "the @xmath8 gaugino and scalar charged under @xmath0 receive supersymmetry breaking masses at the same order @xcite .",
    "this is an interesting possibility which we will not pursue further .",
    "we also note that in the extra - dimensional setup , one can consider a scenario in which the operator in eq .",
    "[ eq : brane ] is absent , and the @xmath1 couples to a messenger sector on the hidden sector brane .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that , even in this case , the boundary values of the scalar masses are still small in comparison with the gaugino mass , and the low energy spectrum is still that of the gaugino mediation .",
    "having shown that combining @xmath1 and anomaly mediation is natural within this class of extra - dimensional models , we now present an explicit implementation . we choose to do that using the same model as in the original @xmath1-mediation papers @xcite .",
    "while certainly not the only possible realization , it is probably one of the simplest possibilities .",
    "* we introduce a new @xmath30 gauge symmetry under which all the mssm fields are charged .",
    "the @xmath30 charges are family universal . *",
    "the charges of @xmath53 and @xmath54 are such that an elementary @xmath2 term in the superpotential is not allowed .",
    "instead we introduce a sm singlet superfield @xmath55 which is charged under @xmath30 , such that the superpotential term @xmath56 is allowed . * to cancel the new anomalies we introduce the following  exotic \" matter : * * 3 pairs of colored , @xmath57 singlet exotics @xmath58 with hypercharge @xmath59 and @xmath60 . *",
    "* 2 pairs of uncolored @xmath57 singlet exotics @xmath61 with hypercharge @xmath62 and @xmath63 . * the exotic fields can couple to @xmath55 , namely the superpotential terms @xmath64 and @xmath65 are allowed . *",
    "normalizing the charges by @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the only free parameters .",
    "the other charges are determined by the anomaly cancellation conditions and the allowed superpotential couplings .",
    "the explicit relations are listed in appendix [ app : charges ] .",
    "the superpotential is @xmath69    we assume that the @xmath1 gaugino mass is generated at the susy breaking scale @xmath11 .",
    "the other gauginos and scalar masses at @xmath11 are generated from the anomaly contribution .",
    "we use the general expressions from @xcite , collected in appendix  [ app : bc ] for completeness .",
    "one interesting feature of this model is that the @xmath70-function of the strong coupling vanishes at one - loop order .",
    "the gluino mass is generated almost exclusively by the anomaly contribution , which is proportional to this @xmath70-function .",
    "this implies that the gluino mass is zero at one loop , but will get a non - zero contribution at the two - loop level .",
    "nevertheless , its size can be comparable to the wino and bino masses , which are non - zero already at one - loop order .",
    "in particular the two - loop gluino mass is still much larger than the @xmath1 contribution . as a result",
    "one finds that for a generic choice of parameters the gaugino mass hierarchy is @xmath71 .",
    "this should be compared to the  standard \" amsb for which the gaugino mass hierarchy is such that the gluino is heavier than the bino and the wino . in other words , since we are considering a non - minimal extension of the standard model , the hierarchy of the gauge coupling @xmath70-functions , and consequently the gaugino mass hierarchy , is different from that of the mssm .",
    "for consistency we will calculate all of the mssm gaugino masses at two - loop level .",
    "the effect of the @xmath1 gauge coupling @xmath70-function must also be included in the anomaly contribution to the scalar masses .",
    "therefore , compared to the standard amsb , it is possible to find that more scalars apart from the sleptons are tachyonic at the uv boundary .",
    "vacuum stability in the very early universe could constrain such a scenario  @xcite . however , without a compelling model of that era of cosmic evolution , we will not take this as a constraint on our parameter space .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the vanishing of the strong coupling @xmath70-function at one - loop order is not an accident , but a rather general result following from these assumptions : introduce @xmath72 generations of exotic quarks ( i.e. , @xmath72 triplets and @xmath72 anti - triplets ) , demanding that there is a single sm singlet field @xmath55 ( or a set of @xmath55 fields with the same @xmath73 charge ) which generates the effective @xmath2 term and gives mass to the exotic quarks , and allow the standard quark yukawa couplings .",
    "the cancellation of the @xmath74 anomaly then requires that @xmath75 @xcite . as a result",
    "the strong coupling @xmath70 function vanishes at one loop .",
    "while the boundary condition at the susy breaking scale for @xmath76 and @xmath77 arise only from the anomaly contribution , the renormalization group equations ( rges ) for these parameters also receive contributions from the interactions with the @xmath1 gaugino .",
    "we run the rges down to the electroweak ( ew ) scale using the two - loop rges for the gauge couplings and the gaugino masses , and the one - loop rges for all the other parameters .",
    "the explicit formulas for the rges are listed in appendix [ app : rges ] .",
    "the rges can be solved numerically .    around the ew scale",
    "we minimize the scalar potential for the neutral higgses and the scalar component of @xmath55 .",
    "it is given by @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the @xmath57 gauge coupling and @xmath80 is related to the hypercharge gauge coupling @xmath81 via @xmath82 .",
    "the vacuum at this scale should break the @xmath0 symmetry as well as the electroweak symmetry .",
    "we typically require that the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath55 is larger than the ew scale . using these vevs",
    "we can calculate the spectrum .",
    "in this section , we review the method we employed to calculate the low energy spectrum from the uv inputs .",

    "these are most easily calculated by using the one - loop coleman - weinberg potential @xcite .",
    "we limit ourselves to the effects of the stop and top loops , which due to the large top yukawa coupling are expected to be the dominant ones .",

    "<S> the gluino is light since it only receives a contribution from 2-loop anomaly mediation , and it decays dominantly into third generation quarks . </S>",
    "<S> gluino production leads to distinct lhc signals and prospects of early discovery . </S>",
