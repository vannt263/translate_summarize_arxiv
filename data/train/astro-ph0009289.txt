    "this boundary is @xmath19 in angular diameter , and is centred on the x - ray centre of the snr ( as given by aschenbach  @xcite ) . within the uncertainties , this diameter is in agreement with that estimated by combi et al .",

    "[ fig_tpsfilt ] , a good deal of additional radio structure is visible in the vicinity of rx  j0852.04622 . over the remnant itself ,",

    "interestingly , the confusing filaments from fig .",

    "being relatively faint , our ability to detect pmn  j08534620 in the 2.42-ghz data is compromised somewhat by confusion , coupled with beam dilution .",

    "the method of `` t  t '' plots was used ( e.g.  turtle et al .",

    "the distance is very poorly constrained by current observational data .",
    "unfortunately , since the remnant is faint , is not detected optically , and is in a complex region , many direct techniques used to determine the distance to snrs are not applicable in this case ( e.g.   absorption , association with other features or molecular clouds , or optical studies ) .",
    "nevertheless , the radio properties of this remnant , even with the present uncertainty in its age and size , have some interesting implications for statistical studies of galactic snrs , which are discussed in the next section .",
    "[ fig_sigmadee ] shows a surface - brightness versus diameter plot for galactic snrs for which there are reasonable distances available ( green @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "rx j0852.04622 is plotted on this figure with a range of diameters corresponding to distances from 200  pc to 1  kpc .",
    "the surface brightness of rx j0852.04622 , of @xmath65 w  m@xmath40  hz@xmath16  sr@xmath16 , is faint for a known galactic snr  among the faintest 20% of catalogued remnants .",
    "this is less than the nominal completeness limit of many radio surveys ( e.g.  green @xcite ) .",
    "note that although most faint remnants are thought to be old , that the remnant of the sn of ad1006 is also faint , with @xmath66 w  m@xmath40  hz@xmath16  sr@xmath16 .",
    "we also note that , whilst rx j0852.04622 is one of the fainter remnants to appear on the @xmath67 plot , the only other remnant detected in @xmath60ti @xmath1-ray emission is cas  a , which has the highest surface brightness .        from fig .",
    "[ fig_sigmadee ] , it is clear that the properties of rx j0852.04622 are very unusual if it lies at the smaller distances suggested by the @xmath1-ray data .",
    "if the snr is at a distance @xmath68  pc , its diameter is less than 10  pc , but its surface brightness is two or more orders of magnitude less than other known young snrs with similar diameters ( e.g.  kepler s sn , tycho s sn , and 3c58 ) .",
    "this would have important consequences for statistical studies of galactic snrs ( see green @xcite ) , as the range of @xmath69  or , equivalently , luminosity  for a given @xmath70 may be even wider than was previously thought .",
    "this in turn would imply that the observational selection effect of faint snrs being difficult to detect is important , not only for old snrs , but also for young snrs .",
    "the low radio surface brightness of rx  j0852.04622 indicates that a fraction of young snrs may be faint at radio wavelengths .",
    "the available sample of young snrs ( i.e.  historical events ) is small , however , so it is not possible to meaningfully estimate this proportion .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the remnant is as distant as 1  kpc , then although it is faint for it s diameter of @xmath71  pc , it is not strikingly unusual .",
    "we have presented various radio observations of the newly recognised snr rx  j0852.04622 , which clarify its size and morphology .",
    "several features possibly associated with the remnant by combi et al .",
    "( @xcite ) are examined , and it is concluded that these are probably unrelated to rx  j0852.04622 .    although the distance and age of rx  j0852.04622 are not well determined , its faintness has some interesting implications for the statistical study of snrs , namely that the surface - brightness limits of current radio surveys may miss faint , young remnants , as well as faint , old remnants .",
    "clearly an accurate distance determination for this snr is important , although this is difficult , given its faintness and the fact that it lies in a complex region of the sky , confused with emission from the much larger vela snr .",
