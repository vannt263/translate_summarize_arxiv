    "<S> we determine how the time - scale for identifying major and minor galaxy mergers via close projected pairs and quantitative morphology ( the gini coefficient @xmath1 , the second - order moment of the brightest 20% of the light @xmath2 , and asymmetry @xmath3 ) depends on baryonic gas fraction @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> strong asymmetries last significantly longer in high gas - fraction mergers of all mass ratios , with time - scales ranging from @xmath5 myr for @xmath6 20% to @xmath7 1 gyr for @xmath6 50% . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the strong evolution with redshift observed in the fraction of asymmetric galaxies may reflect evolution in the gas properties of galaxies rather than the global galaxy merger rate . on the other hand , the time - scale for identifying a galaxy merger via </S>",
