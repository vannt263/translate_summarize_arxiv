    "the angular momentum - mass relation ( or the @xmath3 relation ) is a scaling relation between an astronomical object s angular momentum @xmath0 and its mass @xmath1 .",
    "it was first noticed by @xcite that for a wide range of astronomical objects , from planet - satellite systems to super clusters , their @xmath0 and @xmath1 follow an empirical relation @xmath12 .",
    "later follow - up works confirmed this power law relation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite presented an updated version then of the @xmath3 relation covering @xmath13 orders in mass and @xmath14 orders in angular momentum .",
    "@xcite particularly studied the @xmath15 relation for spiral and elliptical galaxies .",
    "this relation was confirmed again by recent observational updates , e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this @xmath15 relation was also observed for the cold dark matter haloes in cosmological n - body simulations ; see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , etc .",
    "this simple and universal relation from observation and simulation is unusual and demands an explanation .",
    "here we briefly review two widely quoted explanations .",
    "the readers can refer to @xcite for another explanation from the global rotation of the universe .",
    "_ mechanical equilibrium_. this explanation usually appears in astronomical papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when a galaxy ( halo ) becomes virialized , its rotational energy @xmath16 and gravitational energy @xmath17 are linked by the virial theorem , @xmath18 .",
    "using @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , we can obtain @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 are the galaxy s ( halo s ) moment of inertia , average angular velocity and radius respectively , and @xmath24 is the gravitational constant . the key relation used in this explanation is the virial theorem , which implies that galaxies ( haloes ) are in mechanical equilibrium .",
    "_ arguments from the tidal torque theory_. in the tidal torque theory ( ttt , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a halo s angular momentum is induced by the tidal torques from the surrounding inhomogeneities , and thus has a dependence on the halo s moment of inertia and the tidal tensor . since @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "this scaling relation can also be addressed in detail by calculating the joint probability distribution of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath28 ; see e.g. @xcite . from the ensemble results of ttt , @xcite used the statistics of the initial density field to study @xmath28 , and found that @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath29 in the linear regime .",
    "although both explanations lead to the power index @xmath8 in the observed @xmath3 relation , they differ in the origin of the index .",
    "the mechanical equilibrium argument states that the @xmath3 relation is established in the virialized stage , while ttt claims it is found in the linear stage .",
    "further investigations are needed to find the exact origin of the @xmath3 relation .",
    "furthermore , the orbital - merger scenario @xcite shows that the nonlinear evolution has significant effects on the halo angular momentum after the turnaround stage . whether the nonlinear evolution affects the @xmath3 relation is however not addressed .",
    "also , the @xmath3 relation is tightly related to the evolution of angular momentum , which in turn depends on the initial perturbations and cosmological model ( ttt ) .",
    "how do the power spectrum and cosmological model affect the @xmath3 relation ? this is an interesting question that deserves to be answered .",
    "in this paper we use n - body simulations to study the time evolution of the @xmath3 relation for protohaloes . here a protohalo is defined as a clump of matter that is destined to end up as a halo at redshift @xmath9 .",
    "interestingly , @xmath30 is found to be valid in the whole cosmological history , but with different @xmath5 at different redshifts .",
    "this evolution behaviour enables us to test the two possible explanations mentioned above .",
    "the @xmath3 relation in the linear regime is shown to depend on the initial power spectrum and cosmological model .",
    "the dependences of the @xmath3 relation on the environment and merging history are also studied , to see the nonlinear evolution effects .",
    "we propose a three - regime scheme to explain the evolution of the @xmath3 relation , and give a more complete understanding for this relation .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we briefly review the tidal torque theory , and derive the predictions for the @xmath3 in the linear regime .",
    "we describe our n - body simulation details , halo finders , environment classification method and merger tree constructions in section [ s3 ] .",
    "section [ s4 ] presents our results .",
    "the summary and discussion are given in section [ s5 ] .",
    "the appendices summarise some numerical tests , including the simulation box size , resolution , halo finder , fitting method and smoothing schemes in ttt .",
    "for the convenience of later discussion , we summarise some important steps of ttt from @xcite in section [ s2s1 ] .",
    "we then derive the prediction for the @xmath3 relation in the linear regime in section [ s2s2 ] .      in the _ comoving _ eulerian coordinate @xmath31 , the total angular momentum of an object with respect to its center of mass @xmath32 is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the scale factor",

    "higher order expressions can be found in @xcite .    under the zeldovich approximation ,",
    "the angular momentum is @xmath48    further assuming the potential @xmath47 to be smooth in the region @xmath43 , we can approximate it using taylor expansion at the centre of mass position up to second order @xmath49 where the einstein summation convention is used .    substituting equation ( [ eqn08 ] ) into equation ( [ eqn07 ] ) , we obtain the major result of the tidal torque theory : @xmath50 with the tidal tensor @xmath51 and the inertial tensor @xmath52    equation ( [ eqn09 ] ) tells us that in the linear regime , the angular momentum of a protohalo depends on its shape ( represented by @xmath53 ) and the surrounding tidal torque ( measured by @xmath54 ) and evolves according to @xmath55 , i.e. how the universe expands and how the perturbations grow . after the turnaround ,",
    "the protohalo collapses to a virialized object ( halo ) .",
    "ttt assumes that little angular momenta are gained or lost during this nonlinear process .",
    "ttt has been tested using n - body simulations with relatively good agreement .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for recent testings .",
    "the temporal part of @xmath56 , @xmath55 , depends on the cosmological model .",
    "previous studies verified that , for a de sitter universe , or for the matter dominated era in @xmath4cdm model , the halo angular momentum grows linearly with time as @xmath57 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we will test this temporal dependence for a quintessence dark energy model that has different expansion and structure growth rate as @xmath4cdm .    when calculating the tidal tensor @xmath54 , the potential field ( or density field ) is smoothed with a smoothing scale equal to the protohalo scale @xcite , @xmath58 here , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the fourier transforms of the potential function and window function respectively . for the top - hat window function ,",
    "the smoothing scale @xmath61 is usually set by @xmath62 . as pointed out by @xcite",
    ", this smoothing process is needed to keep the validity of the zeldovich approximation used in ttt .",
    "the zeldovich approximation requires @xmath63 .",
    "however , inside a protohalo region , there may exist some smaller scale perturbations with @xmath64 that need to be smoothed out .",
    "however , how to choose the value of @xmath61 is a nontrivial question . in appendix [ as4 ] , we numerically test the choice of @xmath61 and show that the one usually adopted , @xmath65 , is the best choice .",
    "the formalism of @xcite outlined above considers a random region @xmath43 in the smooth density field which may not be a protogalaxy region . to study the angular momenta for density peaks ,",

    ", we use the ensemble results of ttt [ equation ( [ eqn13 ] ) ] and consider the simple scale - free models .    for a scale - free model with density power spectrum @xmath74 in the linear regime ,",

    "assuming @xmath79 , we obtain @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are constants that depend on protohaloes shapes . equation ( [ eqn13 ] ) becomes @xmath83    equation ( [ eqn17 ] ) implies that in the linear regime , for a model with scale - free @xmath84 , the @xmath3 relation has a constant power exponent @xmath85 and a time - dependent coefficient @xmath86 specifically , in the @xmath4cdm model , matter dominates in this regime , @xmath87 , and thus @xmath88 .    if we ignored the scale ( or mass ) dependence of @xmath89 , then @xmath90 .",
    "this is how the previous arguments in ttt explain the observed @xmath3 relation .",
    "however , the smoothing scale @xmath61 in the smoothing potential is related to a protohalo s mass as @xmath62 , and this introduces an additional mass dependence into ttt s predicted angular momentum .",

    "this leads to a larger deviation for @xmath152 from @xmath223 . ( 2 ) the @xmath5 and @xmath144 for mm haloes become stable earlier because they go through less nonlinear evolution .",

    "we have used n - body simulations to study the time - evolution of the @xmath3 relation . from our results emerges a picture of the origin and evolution of the @xmath3 relation in the @xmath4cdm model :    in the linear regime , when all haloes in our sample still evolve linearly , @xmath5 is a constant of @xmath6 and @xmath10 increases linearly with time .",

    "the nonlinear effects drive the @xmath3 relation in the linear regime to the one we observed .",
    "the three - regime scheme implies that for different cosmologies , in the linear regime , @xmath5 has different values according to the initial power spectrum and protohaloes shapes , and @xmath10 evolves with different rates depending on the scale factor and growth rate .",
    "thus , in the linear stage , the @xmath3 relation is quite sensitive to the underlying cosmological model . in the nonlinear regime ,",

    "once galaxies become virialized , their @xmath3 relation remains unchanged .",
    "@xmath5 equals to @xmath8 because it s a result of virialization .",
    "indeed , the spin parameters for baryonic and dark components have been shown to correlate in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations @xcite . however , in the nonlinear regime , due to the complicated baryonic physics , such as radiative cooling , star formation , supernovae and agn feedback , etc .",
    ", protogalaxies @xmath3 relation in this stage might have different behaviours from the dark matter and needs further investigation .",
    "the baryonic processes in the nonlinear regime are also key elements to explain the observed offset between the spirals and ellipticals @xmath3 relations , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "another question related to the baryon physics is how the angular momentum transfer between dark and baryonic matter affects our results .",
    "it has been shown that from the hydrodynamical simulations , the baryonic physics mainly spins up the inner part of a halo , and has minor effects on the whole halo s spin ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "<S> we study the empirical relation between an astronomical object s angular momentum @xmath0 and mass @xmath1 , @xmath2 , the @xmath3 relation , using n - body simulations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we investigate the time evolution of the @xmath3 relation to study how the initial power spectrum and cosmological model affect this relation , and to test two popular models of its origin - mechanical equilibrium and tidal torque theory . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in the @xmath4cdm model , @xmath5 starts with a value of @xmath6 at high redshift @xmath7 , increases monotonically , and finally reaches @xmath8 near @xmath9 , whereas @xmath10 evolves linearly with time in the beginning , reaches a maximum and decreases , and stabilizes finally . </S>",
    "<S> a three - regime scheme is proposed to understand this newly observed picture . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the tidal torque theory accounts for this time evolution behaviour in the linear regime , whereas @xmath11 comes from the virial equilibrium of haloes . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 relation in the linear regime contains the information of the power spectrum and cosmological model . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 relations for haloes in different environments and with different merging histories are also investigated to study the effects of a halo s non - linear evolution . </S>",
    "<S> an updated and more complete understanding of the @xmath3 relation is thus obtained . </S>"
