    "the detection possibility of the invisible axions @xcite chiefly relies on its appreciable couplings to photon @xmath4 which appears in the lagrangian as @xmath5 where @xmath6 the axionic domain - wall number @xcite is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the contribution from the standard model quarks @xcite . with this normalization from the qcd sector ,",
    "the coupling @xmath4 is defined and is composed of two parts , @xmath9 where @xmath3 is the one obtained above the electroweak scale and @xmath10 is the contribution obtained below the qcd chiral phase transition scale . since the mass ratio of up and down quarks is very close to 0.5 @xcite , we use the value @xmath11 below . in this case",
    ", @xmath10 is 2 ( a bit smaller value 1.98 , including the strange quark contribution ) @xcite . the early summary on the axion  photon ",
    "photon couplings were summarized in @xcite .",
    "an invisible axion is a pseudo - goldstone boson whose mother symmetry is the peccei - quinn(pq ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "the symmetry breaking scale relevant for the axion detection experiments @xcite are the intermediate scale @xmath12 , which can be achieved by the vacuum expectation value(vev ) of an su(2)@xmath13u(1)@xmath14 singlet @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "but , the global symmetry which is broken at the intermediate scale has to be fine - tuned to avoid the gravity spoil of global symmetries .",
    "this dificulty has been appreciated @xcite after realizing that even the classical gravity does not necessarily preserve global symmetries due to the topology change via wormholes @xcite .",
    "the wormhole taking out gauge charged is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : wormhole ] .",
    "an observer in the almost flat space o notices that some gauge charges are flown to the shadow world s. to see the effect in his own space only , he cuts the wormhole , then notices that the escaped gauge charges are recovered to o. this conservation of gauge charges in the space o is due to the long range electrix flux lines . for the global charges",
    ", there is no such flux lines and hence the escaped global charges are not considered to be recovered to o if he cuts the wormhole .",
    "thus , global charges are broken if we consider the topology change .",
    "related to this effect , at field theory level within supersymmetric(susy ) framework , a host of discrete symmetries are considered @xcite .",
    "some discrete symmetries can lead to acceptable approximate global symmetries @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we attempt to obtain a region of the parameter space from string compactified 4-dimensional(4d ) effective field theory .",
    "the 4d models from string compactification do not allow global symmetries but allow some discrete symmetries @xcite . the minimal supersymmetric standard model supplied with singlets @xmath15 ( to house the invisible axion as pointed out in @xcite )",
    "will be called @xmath15mssm . in the @xmath15mssm",
    ", we calculate the couplings between axion and photon .",
    "four dimensional pseudoscalars in the @xmath15mssm   from string compactification appear from @xmath16(=10d antisymmetric tensor field with @xmath17 ) and from the matter super - multiplets in the @xmath15mssm . in 10d , @xmath18 is a gauge field satisfying the gauge transformation , @xmath19 where @xmath20 are gauge functions .",
    "if both @xmath21 and @xmath22 take the internal space coordinates @xmath23 , @xmath24 is a pseudoscalar in 4d . from the 4d point of view , the original gauge transformation is not local , not carrying the 4d index @xmath25 .",
    "these pseudoscalars are the model - dependent ( md ) axion @xcite , which is known to generate superpotential terms @xcite .",
    "so , the md axions are not the useful candidates for solutions of the strong cp problem . on the other hand the model - independent(mi )",
    "axion @xcite , where both @xmath21 and @xmath22 of @xmath18 take 4d indices @xmath26 , is a good candidate of 4d gauge transformation .",
    "namely , the gauge transformation ( [ eq : bmngauge ] ) is still a gauge transformation in 4d .",
    "so , @xmath27 is not spoiled by gravity after the compactification",
    ".      if the mi axion is not behaving as a longitudinal degree of a gauge boson , then the axion potential is generated and the bosonic collective motion behaves as cold dark matter ( cdm ) @xcite .",
    "but , then the axion decay constant is near the string scale , @xmath28 @xcite , and a fine - tuning is needed , or the anthropic scenario must be invoked @xcite .",
    "the coupling @xmath4 is the same as the one considered in the following subsection with anomalous u(1 ) without extra charged singlets .",
    "if the compactification produces an anomalous u(1)@xmath29 gauge symmetry , the corresponding u(1)@xmath29 gauge boson obtains a large mass , at a slightly lower scale than the string scale .",
    "the presence of a fayet - illiopoulos d - term connects the mi axion with the anomalous u(1)@xmath29 gauge boson @xcite , which is a kind of the higgs mechanism providing the longitudinal degree of the gauge boson .",
    "the generator of the anomalous u(1)@xmath29 belongs to the @xmath30 algebra , and matter fields have the u(1)@xmath29 charges .",
    "the field @xmath27 or the mi axion does not couple to matter fields .",
    "so below the u(1)@xmath29 gauge boson mass scale , the u(1)@xmath29 charge of matter fields becomes a global charge which can be called a u(1)@xmath0 charge . in this way , a global symmetry free of the gravity obstruction",
    "is created below the u(1)@xmath29 gauge boson mass scale .",
    "since the mother u(1)@xmath29 is a gauge symmetry , there is no gravity obstruction of this u(1)@xmath0 global symmetry . in string",
    "compactification , it has been explicitly shown that the anomalies are the same for all gauge groups both for non - abelian and ( properly normalized ) abelian gauge fields @xcite .",
    "thus , the compactification of anomalous u(1 ) gauge symmetries can be gates to low energy gravity - safe global symmetries . in the compactification of type - i and type - iib string",
    ", there can be three anomalous u(1 ) s @xcite , where however the full phenomenologically acceptable @xmath15mssm  spectrum of matter fields are not presented , which forbids us from calculating @xmath4 . here , we restrict to the case of @xmath27 from the heterotic string .",
    "let the anomalous gauge symmetry be u(1)@xmath29 .",
    "its charge operator and the coupling constant be @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the potential which is invariant under u(1)@xmath29 is also invariant under the global symmetry u(1)@xmath33 whose charge generator is also @xmath31 . to see the effective global symmetry below the anomalous scale , therefore , it is sufficient to see how the local transformation is described . since the longitudinal degree of the u(1)@xmath29 gauge boson",
    "is solely provided by @xmath27 , matter scalars having the nonvanishing @xmath31 charge do not develop vevs . to see the u(1)@xmath29 gauge transformation of a complex scalar @xmath34 , consider the kinetic energy term @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "the gauge transformation @xmath37 leads the kinetic energy term to @xmath38 if we consider the global transformation u(1)@xmath33 below the anomalous scale , only the first term survives in the above equation , @xmath39 where we expressed the u(1)@xmath29 gauge boson as @xmath40 .",
    "below the anomalous scale , it describes a global symmetry u(1)@xmath33 coupling with the heavy anomalous gauge boson with the same charge @xmath31 . in the potential @xmath41 , this gauge boson coupling respects the global symmetry also .",
    "thus , we obtain an exact global symmetry u(1)@xmath33 below the anomalous scale .",
    "thus , an intermediate scale global symmetry is from the anomalous u(1)@xmath29 in the compactification process of the heterotic string .",
    "since the anomalous u(1)@xmath29 has the same coupling to gauge fields , we have the following mi axion coupling , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the properly normalized u(1 ) gauge field .",
    "note that @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "note that @xmath46 in the su(5 ) model . here , we used @xmath47 therefore , we obtain the following coupling for the anomalous case , @xmath48 where we used @xmath49 .",
    ".the axion - photon - photon coupling for several invisible axion models .",

    "if @xmath65 is completed by the simple su(@xmath22 ) generators , the information on the fundamental representation is enough since the other higher dimensiomnal representations can be constructed in terms of direct products of fundamentals . at the gut scale three gauge couplings are the same , and the mixing angle is defined as @xmath66 . for properly normalized generators @xmath67 and @xmath68 in the fundamental representation , the trace is @xmath69 , and we have @xmath70 where @xmath71 at the gut scale . thus , we obtain @xmath72 for the su(5 ) model , it is @xmath73 . for the electromagnetic charge ( [ eq : qinsun ] ) in su(@xmath22 ) , the mixing angle is @xmath74 the su(7 ) model of ref .",
