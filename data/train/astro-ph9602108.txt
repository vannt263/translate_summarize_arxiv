    "we infer the composition of the cosmic rays from measurements at mountain altitudes of the hadronic and electromagnetic component of the air cascades initiated at the top of the atmosphere .",
    "a connection between the nature of the primary particle and air shower observations requires the detailed understanding of particle interactions at very high energies and forward scattering angles where no information is available from accelerator - based experiments .",
    "the basic problem is that one is faced with the impossibility of deducing two unknowns , the composition and the dynamics of particle interactions , from a single measurement .",
