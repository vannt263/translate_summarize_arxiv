    "one of the most important and well studied questions in particle physics is why the observable universe has a tiny but non - zero ratio of baryons to photons without which there would be no stars , planets or life .",
    "the measurement of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies and the successful prediction of light element abundances from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , both lead to a consistent value of this ratio at the recombination time when atoms are formed @xcite , @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are baryon and photon number densities respectively .",
    "any theory which successfully produces such a baryon asymmetry must fulfil the famous sakharov conditions @xcite of c and cp violation , @xmath5 violation and departure from thermal equilibrium .",
    "one of the most popular of these is known as leptogenesis @xcite , which takes advantage of the fact that non - perturbative , @xmath6 conserving , @xmath7 violating sphaleron processes can convert a lepton number asymmetry into a @xmath5 asymmetry .",
    "the lepton number asymmetry is obtained from the decays of heavy majorana neutrinos and so leptogenesis is intimately linked to neutrino mass , mixing and cp violation .",
    "the discovery of neutrino mass and mixing is arguably one of the most influential observations in particle physics in the last 15 years .",
    "it has inspired a large number of works aimed at explaining both the extremely small mass and , in particular , the striking mixing pattern ( which is very different from the close to diagonal quark sector ) @xcite .",
    "seesaw mechanisms provide the most common explanation for small neutrino masses ; a heavy particle is introduced which has a yukawa coupling with the lepton doublet .",
    "when this particle is integrated out , the effective theory has a majorana mass term for the left - handed neutrinos which is suppressed by the large mass of the new particle .",
    "this new particle must be a colour singlet but can be a weak fermionic singlet with zero hypercharge ( type  i ) @xcite , a weak scalar triplet with two units of hypercharge ( type  ii ) @xcite or a weak fermionic triplet with zero hypercharge ( type  iii ) @xcite .",
    "the issue of neutrino mixing is also very well studied , and a popular technique is to postulate the existence of an extra family symmetry at high energies .",
    "this symmetry is then broken in a specific way , by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of heavy scalars called flavons .",
    "the remnants of the breaking pattern show up in the observed mixing of neutrinos at low energies .    many of these models of neutrino mixing ( predominantly employing the type i seesaw ) exhibit a property known as form dominance ( fd ) @xcite , defined by the condition that the columns of the neutrino yukawa matrix are proportional to columns of the mixing matrix in a particular basis corresponding to diagonal charged lepton and right - handed neutrino mass matrices . as discussed in several papers @xcite , models with family symmetry typically predict vanishing cp violating lepton asymmetry parameters  @xmath8 and hence zero leptogenesis .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , this can be understood very simply from the fd property that the columns of the neutrino yukawa matrix are mutually orthogonal since they are proportional to the columns of the mixing matrix which is unitary .",
    "however in family symmetry models the yukawa matrices are predicted at the scale of family symmetry breaking , which may be close to the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale , and above the mass scale of right - handed neutrinos .",
    "therefore in such models the yukawa matrix will be subject to renormalisation group ( rg ) running from the family breaking scale down to the scale of right - handed neutrino masses relevant for leptogenesis . to illustrate the effects of rg corrections , we analyse two specific models involving sizeable neutrino and @xmath1 yukawa couplings and satisfying fd at leading order ( lo ) : the first model @xcite reproduces the well studied tri - bimaximal ( tb ) mixing pattern @xcite ; and the second model @xcite reproduces the tri - maximal ( tm ) mixing pattern @xcite consistent with the results from t2k @xcite .",
    "although in both models rg running occurs over only one or two orders of magnitude in the energy scale , we shall show that this leads to sufficient violation of fd to allow successful leptogenesis in each case .",
    "one could ask why rg effects should be considered when higher order ( ho ) operators in the @xmath0 model have been shown to produce a realistic value of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the answer is that rg effects turn out to be of equal importance to ho operators in determining leptogenesis and so in general both effects should be considered together .",
    "here we choose to drop the effect of ho operators for clarity : we want to study the effects of rg corrections to leptogenesis in isolation in order to illustrate the magnitude of the effect .",
    "moreover , there are ultraviolet completions of the @xmath0 model of both tb @xcite and tm mixing @xcite in which ho operators play a negligible role , and the viability of leptogenesis in such cases then relies exclusively on the effects of rg corrections considered here .",
    "we emphasise that this paper represents the first study which takes into account rg corrections to leptogenesis in family symmetry models .",
    "the results in this paper show that rg corrections have a large impact on leptogenesis in any family symmetry models involving neutrino yukawa couplings of order unity .",
    "therefore , when considering leptogenesis in such models , rg corrections should not be ignored even when corrections arising from ho operators are also present .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section [ sec : lepto ] briefly outlines the process of calculating the baryon asymmetry of the universe @xmath9 arising from leptogenesis .",
    "then in section [ sec : formdom ] , the idea of fd is introduced and it is shown that the cp violating parameter in leptogenesis is indeed zero under the condition of fd . section [ sec : afmodel ] introduces the altarelli - feruglio @xmath0 model of tb neutrino mixing , while section [ sec : tri ] introduces the parameters of the @xmath0 model of tm mixing . in section [ sec : rge ]",
    "we analytically estimate the rg running of the neutrino yukawa matrices in leading log approximation .",
    "numerical results for the baryon asymmetry of the universe arising from leptogenesis in both tb and tm models are presented in section [ sec : results ] including contour plots of input parameters reproducing the physical value of @xmath9 .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "leptogenesis takes advantage of the heavy right - handed neutrinos introduced in many models to account for the smallness of the left - handed neutrino mass .",
    "the addition of these right - handed neutrino fields @xmath10 introduces two new terms into the superpotential @xmath11 which then lead to an effective light neutrino mass once the heavy degrees of freedom are integrated out .",
    "in , @xmath10 are the heavy right - handed neutrinos with majorana mass matrix @xmath12 ; @xmath13 are the lepton doublets and @xmath14 the ( hypercharge @xmath15 ) higgs doublet , which interact with @xmath10 through the yukawa couplings @xmath16 .",
    "these interactions also fulfil the well known sakharov conditions @xcite required to generate a baryon asymmetry : 1 ) c and cp violation ( coming from the complex yukawa coupling ) ; 2 ) @xmath5 violation ( the majorana mass of @xmath17s violates @xmath18 ; sphalerons convert @xmath19 of this into @xmath5 violation ) ; 3 ) departure from thermal equilibrium ( due to out - of - equilibrium decays of the right - handed neutrinos ) .",
    "the procedure for calculation of this asymmetry is first to calculate the amount of cp violation in the decays of the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "this is then used as an input parameter to find the @xmath6 asymmetry through integration of the boltzmann equations @xcite .",
    "these equations take into account the evolution of a @xmath6 asymmetry generated by @xmath17 decays against the background of @xmath17 inverse decays partially washing it out .",
    "finally , this @xmath6 asymmetry is converted into a @xmath5 asymmetry using previously calculated results for sphaleron processes @xcite .      to one - loop order",
    ", the cp asymmetry arises from the interference of the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : lepto ] .    using the standard supersymmetric feynman rules",
    ", one can calculate the decay widths for the decay @xmath20 , @xmath21 ; these are then used to find the cp asymmetry for @xmath10 by summing over all lepton flavours @xmath22 @xcite , @xmath23 here , @xmath24 are the real mass eigenvalues of @xmath12 , and @xcite @xmath25 with @xmath26 , is the loop factor .",
    "note that @xmath27 is summed over all flavours of the outgoing lepton and is called the _ unflavoured _ asymmetry .",
    "the above discussion and formula for @xmath28 is relevant when the lepton doublets produced are a coherent superposition of the three flavours .",
    "this is only the case above a certain energy when the expansion rate of the universe is greater than all charged lepton interaction rates .",
    "however , as the universe cools , the @xmath1 lepton yukawa coupling will start to come in to equilibrium at an energy of around @xcite @xmath29 gev , here is the ratio of mssm higgs vevs , and will be defined algebraically in section [ sec : afmodel ] . ]",
    "breaking the coherence of the single state superposition @xmath30 down into two states : the @xmath1 and the remaining coherent combination @xmath31 .",
    "thus , if the dynamics of leptogenesis occur below this temperature , interaction rate must be faster than the @xmath17 inverse decay rate to overcome the quantum zeno effect @xcite , but this is a small effect and beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "] one should take such differences into account in the calculations .",
    "the cp parameter taking into account such flavour effects is @xcite @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 as above .",
    "ultimately we want to estimate a value for the baryon to photon ratio at recombination ; this is related to the @xmath6 asymmetry @xmath35 at the leptogenesis scale by @xcite @xmath36 the numerical coefficient above has two contributions : 1 ) from the @xmath6 conserving sphaleron processes ( which are only @xmath37 efficient at converting @xmath6 into @xmath5 ) ; 2 ) from scaling by photon number density in the relevant comoving volume ( recall that we are calculating the baryon to photon ratio at recombination ) .",
    "the sphalerons convert part of the @xmath18 asymmetry into a @xmath5 asymmetry via a suppressed dimension @xmath38 operator active at the energies we consider , @xmath39 .",
    "the cp asymmetries calculated in the previous section are then related to @xmath35 via @xmath40 which defines the efficiency parameters @xmath41 ; these encode how efficiently the decays of @xmath17 produce a @xmath6 asymmetry at the leptogenesis scale . in the strong washout regime , the @xmath41 are approximated analytically by ( up to superpartner effects which increase @xmath35 by a factor of @xmath42 ; see , for example , @xcite ) : @xmath43 with @xmath44 the decay parameter @xmath45 and effective neutrino mass @xmath46 the @xmath47 are model specific and are presented below for the model in question ( in table  [ tab : flavoured ] ) , while @xmath48 ev @xcite is the equilibrium neutrino mass .",
    "the up - type higgs vev is denoted by @xmath49 .",
    "the main point to address is then the form that the yukawa matrices take .",
    "this is discussed in the context of family symmetries @xcite which we turn to now .",
    "in order to explain the observed pattern of neutrino mixing , many models invoke the idea that a high energy family symmetry unifying the three flavours is spontaneously broken in a specific way that leaves some imprint in the neutrino sector at low energies .",
    "this method introduces relationships between the parameters of @xmath50 leading to predictions for @xmath51 and @xmath52 . as discussed in the introduction , it is a striking fact that many of these family symmetry models exhibit a property known as fd @xcite , which constrains the cp violating parameter of leptogenesis to be identically zero @xcite , as we now discuss .",
    "the fd @xcite condition is that the columns of @xmath50 in eq .",
    "are proportional to the columns of @xmath53 , @xmath54 where @xmath53 is the unitary pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix which is parameterised by three mixing angles and three complex phases ( one dirac and two majorana ) .",
    "the consequences of such fd on leptogenesis is then very simple to understand : since @xmath53 is unitary , the columns of @xmath50 must be mutually orthogonal .",
    "this means that the contraction @xmath55 , with @xmath56 , appearing in eqs and are identically zero and so leptogenesis gives @xmath57 .",
    "the fd condition also greatly simplifies the form of the effective neutrino mass matrix arising from the type i seesaw formula . in terms of parameters in eq .",
    ", the effective neutrino mass matrix can be written , @xmath58 in the basis where the right - handed neutrinos are diagonal , i.e. that in which @xmath59 , and writing @xmath60 , eq .",
    "gives @xmath61 in the charged lepton diagonal basis , @xmath62 is diagonalised by @xmath53 . assuming fd",
    ", @xmath62 is diagonalisable independently of the parameters @xmath63 , and , from ( [ eqn : columns ] ) and ( [ eqn : form ] ) , one finds @xmath64 a particularly well studied case is that of tb mixing @xcite .",
    "however , as emphasised in @xcite , tb mixing is not linked to fd .",
    "indeed we shall study two @xmath0 family symmetry models , one with tb mixing and one with tm mixing , where fd is present in both cases , leading to zero leptogenesis at lo , before rg corrections are included .",
    "we first consider the parameters of the altarelli - feruglio @xmath0 model of tb mixing with renormalisable neutrino dirac coupling @xcite , @xmath66 where , under @xmath0 , the conventionally defined fields transform as @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , while @xmath70 and @xmath71 ; the @xmath72 are constant complex parameters . since this model is well known , we refer the reader to @xcite for more details .",
    "the charged lepton mass matrix in the basis used in @xcite is diagonal so the mixing structure in the neutrino sector will not receive corrections from charged lepton rotations .",
    "the tb structure in the neutrino sector arises from the flavon fields obtaining vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) in particular directions , @xmath73 where the dynamics responsible for vacuum alignment has been extensively studied ( for instance , in @xcite for @xmath74-term alignment or in @xcite for @xmath75-term alignment ) .",
    "the tb structure arises in the majorana sector of eq .",
    ", explicitly @xmath76 where we define @xmath77 , @xmath78 as complex parameters with phase @xmath79 . for the purposes of leptogenesis it is convenient to rotate the @xmath17 such that their mass matrix is diagonal .",
    "the resulting neutrino yukawa matrix in the diagonal @xmath17 basis is then , @xmath80 one can see explicitly that fd is present in this model , since the columns of @xmath81 are manifestly proportional to the columns of the tb mixing matrix , and thus it immediately follows that @xmath82 at the scale of @xmath0 breaking .",
    "the phases defined in are given as , @xmath83 therefore , there are actually only two phases ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) and two magnitudes ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) in the model , although only phase differences appear when considering physical quantities .",
    "this means that we may set one phase to zero without loss of generality ; for our calculations we choose @xmath88 .    in this basis , the majorana neutrino mass matrix is real and diagonal and is given by @xmath89 the effective left - handed neutrino masses are then given by is the heaviest right - handed neutrino mass .",
    "this means that @xmath90 and @xmath91 will be dominant contributions to leptogenesis , coming from the lightest right - handed neutrino .",
    "this is simply a notational consideration , and does not affect the physics . ] @xmath92 which incorporates the susy parameter @xmath93 @xmath94",
    "in light of results from t2k @xcite indicating a sizeable reactor angle , models predicting tb mixing can potentially be ruled out .",
    "instead , schemes such as tm mixing remain viable @xcite : @xmath95 here @xmath96 and @xmath97 is related to the dirac phase .",
    "it is possible to minimally extend the altarelli - feruglio model above by adding a flavon in the @xmath98 representation of @xmath0 which reproduces this pattern @xcite : @xmath99 where we define the complex parameter @xmath100 , with phase @xmath101 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the addition of this flavon does nt affect the right - handed neutrino masses to first order , and so the parameters in common with the previous section will be unaffected .",
    "analogously to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : altyuk ] ) , in the basis where charged leptons are diagonal and right - handed neutrinos are real and diagonal , the yukawa matrix for tm mixing is , @xmath102 where the @xmath103 are as in eq . .",
    "we can see that the columns of this matrix are proportional to columns of @xmath104 and therefore the model respects fd .",

    "this shows that the contributions from the charged lepton yukawa couplings breaks the orthogonality of the columns , appearing as they do in only the third component of each column .",

    "<S> we study renormalisation group ( rg ) corrections relevant for leptogenesis in the case of family symmetry models such as the altarelli - feruglio @xmath0 model of tri - bimaximal lepton mixing or its extension to tri - maximal mixing . such corrections are particularly relevant since in large classes of family symmetry models , to leading order , the cp violating parameters of leptogenesis would be identically zero at the family symmetry breaking scale , due to the form dominance property . we find that rg corrections violate form dominance and enable such models to yield viable leptogenesis at the scale of right - handed neutrino masses . more generally , the results of this paper show that rg corrections to leptogenesis can not be ignored for any family symmetry model involving sizeable neutrino and @xmath1 yukawa couplings . </S>"
