    "the sm predicts that the mixing - dependent cp violation measured in @xmath1 should be the same as in @xmath2 .",
    "belle , however , has found an opposite sign in @xmath1 for two consecutive years  @xcite . the current discrepancy with sm prediction stands at a 3.5@xmath3 level .",
    "although belle result is not consistent with babar , the combined result still has a 2.7@xmath3 deviation from sm expectation .",
    "it was pointed out  @xcite that a light strange - beauty squark , resulted from near - maximal mixing between the second and third right - handed ( rh ) squarks , provides all necessary ingredients to account for the discrepancy .",
    "it provides ( 1 ) a large @xmath4@xmath5 flavor mixing , ( 2 ) a unique new cp violating phase , and ( 3 ) right - handed dynamics .",
    "the latter is needed for explaining why similar  wrong - sign \" effects are not observed in the modes such as @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this near - maximal mixing is motivated by a combination of abelian flavor symmetry ( afs ) and susy .",
    "such a near - maximal mixing allows one state to be considerably lighter than the common squark mass scale @xmath8 .",
    "a detailed study of various @xmath9 decays suggested  @xcite that @xmath10 gev and @xmath11 gev are needed , while the squark mass scale @xmath8 can be well above 1 tev .",
    "it is clear that a squark as light as 200 gev is of great interest at the tevatron .",
    "one should independently pursue the search for such a light @xmath12 , even if the @xmath1 cp violation discrepancy evaporates in the next few years .",
    "we note that a strange - beauty squark , carrying @xmath13 50% in strange and beauty flavor , would lead to a weakening of bounds on beauty squark search based on @xmath5-tagging .",
    "the susy scenario that we have is that ( i ) the generic soft susy scale is at tev , ( ii ) a rh strange - beauty squark as light as 200 gev , ( iii ) a relatively light gluino @xmath14 gev that goes together with the squark in the gluino - squark loop .",
    "we summarize our work @xcite on strange - beauty squark - pair production , and various decay scenarios of the squark at the tevatron .",
    "we focus only on the @xmath15 right - handed strange and beauty squarks , whose mass matrix is given by , @xmath16 which can be diagonalized by the transformation @xmath17 the relevant gluino - quark - squark interactions in the mass eigenbasis are @xmath18 \\ ; \\nonumber \\\\   & & -i g_s a^a_\\mu t^a_{ij } \\,\\left ( \\widetilde{sb}_{1i}^ *   { \\stackrel{\\leftrightarrow}{\\partial}}_\\mu \\widetilde{sb}_{1j }   + \\widetilde{sb}_{2i}^ *   { \\stackrel{\\leftrightarrow}{\\partial}}_\\mu \\widetilde{sb}_{2j } \\right )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + g_s^2 ( t^a t^b)_{ij } a^{a\\mu } a^b_{\\mu } \\left ( \\widetilde{sb}_{1i}^ *   \\widetilde{sb}_{1j }   + \\widetilde{sb}_{2i}^ * \\widetilde{sb}_{2j } \\right ) \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the production of the strange - beauty squark can proceed via @xmath19 the gluino so produced will decay into a strange or beauty quark plus the strange - beauty squark @xmath12 .",

    "[ xs - teva](a ) . as expected , the production is dominated by @xmath22 annihilation . for a gluino mass of 500 gev",
    "the gluino - pair cross section is only a few fb , but , however , the feed - down from gluino becomes comparable to direct @xmath12 pair production when @xmath23 gev .",
    "therefore , at high @xmath24 the gluino contribution can help extending the sensitivity further .",
    "the situation is different at the lhc , please refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "gluino pair production and squark pair production cross sections are both above 10 pb for @xmath25 gev and @xmath26 gev , and both contributions have to be taken into account .",
    "we also show the production cross sections at @xmath0 colliders in fig .",
    "[ xs - teva](b ) .",
    "we consider three scenarios for the decay of @xmath12 .      when the @xmath12 is the lsp and @xmath27-parity is conserved , the @xmath20 pair so produced will hadronize into color - neutral hadrons by combining with some light quarks .",
    "such objects are strongly - interacting massive particles , electrically either neutral or charged .",
    "if the hadron is electrically neutral , it will pass through the tracker with little trace .",
    "however , if it is electrically charged it will undergo ionization energy loss in the central tracking system , hence behaves like a `` heavy muon '' .",
    "we did a similar analysis as cdf search for stable charged particles @xcite with the following selective cuts : @xmath28 in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown the cross sections from direct @xmath12 pair production with all the above acceptance cuts , for detecting 1 massive stable charged particle ( mcp ) , 2 mcps , or at least 1 mcps in the final state .",
    "the sensitivity can reach up to almost @xmath29 gev with an integrated luminosity of 2 fb@xmath30 .",
    "in this case the @xmath12 pair so produced will decay via the @xmath27-parity violating couplings @xmath31 or @xmath32 .",
    "for simplicity we only consider @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "the strange - beauty squark will decay into @xmath35 or @xmath36 , and thus behaves like scalar leptoquarks of the first or second generation , respectively .",
    "the most stringent limit on leptoquarks comes from a combined analysis that pushes the first generation leptoquark limit to around 260 gev @xcite .",
    "therefore , we believe that the limit that can be reached at the end of run ii ( 2fb@xmath30 ) is very likely above 300 gev . with an order",
    "more luminosity , the limit may be able to reach 350 gev .",
    "in this case the @xmath12 so produced will decay into a strange or beauty quark plus the neutralino or the gravitino , depending on the susy breaking models .",
    "there are 2 quark jets in the final state of @xmath37 pair production , each of them either strange or beauty flavored , and with large missing energy due to the neutralinos or gravitinos .",
    "we performed an analysis with the following selective cuts and @xmath5-tagging and mistag efficiencies : @xmath38 note that the branching ratio of the strange - beauty squark into a @xmath5 quark scales as @xmath39 . with an integrated luminosity of 2 fb@xmath30",
    "the sensitivity is around 300 gev , if @xmath40 .",
    "if the integrated luminosity can go up to 20 fb@xmath30 , then the sensitivity increases to 350 gev .",
    "we also emphasize that the double - tag vs single - tag ratio contains information on @xmath39 , while their sum , when compared with the standard @xmath41 squark pair production , provides additional consistency check on cross section vs mass .    in conclusion ,",
    "the recent possible cp violation discrepancy in @xmath1 decay suggests the possibility of a light strange - beauty squark @xmath12 that carries both strange and beauty flavors .",
    "such an unusual squark can be searched for at the tevatron run ii , with the precaution that @xmath12 can decay into a beauty or strange quark , and the standard @xmath41 search should be broadened .",
    "discovery up to 300 gev is not a problem , and anomalous behavior in both production cross sections and the single versus double tag ratio may provide confirming evidence for the strange - beauty squark .",
