    "supernovae ( sne ) mark the end of the life cycle of certain stars",
    ". studies of sne are important both for understanding the physics leading to and driving these explosions , as well as the impact that the sne have on their environments . as the main producers of heavy elements , sne",
    "are pivotal for understanding the chemical evolution in galaxies as well as the intergalactic medium via sn - driven outflows from galaxies .",
    "sne are also thought to be one of the producers of dust in the universe ( e.g. , review by kozasa et al .",
    "furthermore , sne tie into feedback processes regulating galaxy formation . to understand how these processes evolve with cosmic time , it is important to understand how the number of exploding sne changes with redshift , i.e. , the evolution of the cosmic sn rate ( snr ) .",
    "since sne , particularly the core collapse ( cc ) sne , have massive progenitors with short main - sequence lifetimes , the rate should closely follow the star formation rate ( sfr ) , offering a direct and independent way of measuring the sfr and at the same time the metal enrichment rate . while this method is straightforward in principle , it is hampered particularly by the need for corrections due to dust extinction in order to derive accurate rates . for type ia sne ,",
    "determining the rate offers a way to estimate the delay time between the formation of the progenitor star and its explosion as an sn , which may shed light on the still mostly unknown scenarios leading up to the explosion of the degenerate white dwarfs that are assumed to be the progenitors of type ia sne ( e.g. , madau et al .",

    "due to their potential as standard candles used to measure the expansion rate of the universe ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ; astier et al . 2006 ) , a large number of surveys aiming at detecting type ia sne have been conducted during the last decade , resulting in a multitude of rate estimates .",
    "for a recent compilation of rates from the literature , see graur et al .",
    "( 2011 ) .",
    "while these results show a fair consensus that the type ia snr increased by at least a factor of @xmath143 between redshift @xmath15  and @xmath16 , there is still an uncertainty in the rates at @xmath17 , reflecting the uncertainty in such searches , the limited statistics and relatively high systematic errors concerning searches at @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , optical searches are also hampered by the redshifting of the sn spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , making them drop out of optical filters at @xmath191 .",
    "deep surveys in the near - infrared ( ir ) , such as the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ based candels ( grogin et al . 2011 ; koekemoer et al .",
    "2011 ) and clash ( postman et al . 2012 ) programs , should help alleviate this scarcity of high - redshift type ia sne .",
    "rodney et al . ( 2012 ) demonstrate the possibility of detecting and follow - up of type ia sne at @xmath20  using ir searches .",
    "while type ia sne have been the focus of a large number of surveys during the last decade , there has been a lack of dedicated surveys aiming at finding cc sne at cosmological distances .",
    "most of the existing surveys suffer from severe selection biases since the foremost aim has been to select clean samples of type ia sne and little follow - up has been devoted to non - type ia sn transients , including cc sne .",
    "furthermore , cc sne are harder to detect and follow on the light curve because they are typically @xmath142 mag fainter than type ia sne . therefore , there are significantly fewer cc snrs reported in the literature compared to type ia snrs .    the local cc snr ( outer distances between 11 and @xmath14200 mpc ) has been determined by cappellaro et al .",

    "most rates are consistent with each other and they increase with look - back time , reflecting the increased sfr between @xmath15  and @xmath27 . however , there are some significant differences in the measured local rates . furthermore , there are also claims by horiuchi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) that the snr in general is a factor of @xmath142  lower than predicted from the sfrs , suggesting that there are possible unaccounted systematic effects that may affect the determined rates .",
    "most importantly , necessary corrections to account for the dimming of the sne by dust in the host galaxies are highly uncertain .",
    "the effect of dust extinction is also expected to increase with redshift since the rest frame probed in optical searches approaches the uv part of the spectrum where the effect of extinction is more severe .",
    "there should also be a population of cc sne almost completely hidden from optical searches in highly extinguished luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; see , e.g. , mannucci et al .",
    "2007 ; mattila et al . 2004 , 2012 ) . since the fraction of the star formation that occurs in u / lirgs increases significantly with look - back time and actually dominates the total star formation at @xmath28   ( e.g. , magnelli et al .",
    "2011 ) , we expect the number of cc sne hidden in these environments to increase with redshift .",
    "the cc sne hidden in such galaxies must be accounted for when the aim is to derive the complete rates of cc sne .    also , having a good knowledge of how the sn population is divided into different subtypes and the luminosity function of each subtype is essential for deriving accurate rates .",
    "in particular , knowing the fraction of faint cc sne ( @xmath29 - 15 ) is important when deriving rates since these will remain mostly undetected and must be corrected for when estimating rates .    in this paper",
    ", we use the sn sample detected in the extended goods / pans sn survey conducted with @xmath30/acs 20022005 to derive the rate of cc sne to redshift @xmath311.1 . in a previous paper ( dahlen et al .",

    "118 sne were detected during the full search campaign .",
    "based on sn spectra , colors , light curves , sne and host galaxy redshifts ( spectroscopic when available , otherwise photometric redshifts based on optical+nir bands ) , we classified the candidates into 56 type ia sne and 62 cc sne ( see strolger et al .",
    "2004 for details regarding the typing of the sne ) .",
    "for the cc sne , which are the focus of this investigation , we have spectroscopic redshifts of the sn or the host galaxy for 53 sne , while we use photometric redshifts for 6 host galaxies .",
    "the remaining three sne are apparently hostless and for these we estimate the redshift based on the sn magnitudes , colors , and light curve .",
    "the number of cc sne used to calculate the rates is 45 , excluding from the full sample the sne that are outside the redshift range investigated , @xmath0 , are fainter than our adopted cut - off magnitude @xmath37=25.8 ( see section 3.2 ) , or were detected as decliners present already in the reference epoch .",
    "the snr is calculated using monte carlo simulations as described in detail in dahlen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . in summary ,",
    "the simulations assume a given input rate within a particular redshift bin and calculates the number of detectable sne for a search with an observational setup identical to the @xmath30  search , i.e. , field of view , temporal spacing between epochs , number of epochs , and detection limits .",
    "a number of properties characterizing the sn population go into the simulations , such as the distribution of sn peak brightness , light curve shapes , spectral evolution , the relative fraction of different subtypes , and extinction .",
    "rates are thereafter calculated by adjusting the input rate so that the predicted number of detectable sne matches the number found in the actual search within each redshift bin .",
    "below we give a brief summary of the assumptions used in this investigation when calculating the rates .",
    "cc sne are traditionally divided into different subtypes based on spectral features or light curve shapes . since each type has different peak luminosity distributions and temporal evolution , it is important to correctly characterize each subtype as well as determine the relative frequency of each type .",
    "we divide the cc sne into four main types ; type ii plateau ( iip ) , type ii linear ( iil ) , type ii with narrow emission lines ( iin ) , and stripped envelope sne ( se ) , where the latter includes types ib , ic , and iib .",
    "furthermore , richardson et al . ( 2002 , 2006 ) note that the iil and se types have indications of a bi - modality in the luminosity function and present peak magnitudes for both a normal and a bright subpopulation .",
    "here we adopt this subdivision into two different subtypes for iil and se types .",
    "peak magnitudes and dispersion for the six types used here are taken from richardson et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2006 ) and are given in table [ tab1 ] .      to estimate the relative intrinsic fractions of the different subtypes we use the results from smartt et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and li et al .",
    "smartt et al .",
    "present the relative fractions in a volume - limited sample ( @xmath3828 mpc ) , in total consisting of 92 cc sne , while li et al .",
    "present a volume - limited sample ( @xmath3860 mpc ) consisting of 133 cc sne . here",
    "we combine these results to improve the statistics when deriving the fractions .",
    "note that there is an overlap of 24 sne in the two samples , and we take this into account when combining the two .",
    "the results are presented in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the iip type is most common ( 54.8% ) followed by the se sne ( 34.0% ) .",
    "only minor fractions belong to the iil type ( 6.1% ) and iin type ( 5.1% ) .",
    "however , since that latter two types are more luminous on average than the former two , particularly iin , the observed fraction of sne in a magnitude - limited search will likely have higher fractions of these subtypes .",
    "to estimate the subfraction within the iil and se types that belong to the bright population , we use the number of bright and normal sne in each of the samples used in richardson et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2006 ) .",
    "however , since these are basically magnitude - limited samples , we can not use the observed fraction of bright sne since they will be over - represented due to their brightness , which could bias the calculation of relative fractions . for the se type , the sample in richardson et al . (",
    "2006 ) consists of 4 bright and 23 normal sne . inspecting",
    "the distance moduli for these sne reveals that three of the four bright se sne are at larger distances compared to the normal type , while one of them is at a distance where normal sne are also detected .",
    "this suggests that 1/24 , corresponding to @xmath144% of the se sne , belong to the bright group , although with high uncertainty . for the iil subtype , 4 objects out of a total of 16 belong to the bright subsample in richardson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . inspecting the distance moduli for these objects does not show any significant difference between the bright and normal subsamples .",
    "we therefore assume that 4/16 , or 25% of the iil sne , belong to the brighter population . in the fifth column of table [ tab1 ]",
    "we also include this subdivision of the se and iil types .",
    "we again note that these fractions are uncertain . furthermore , while these are calculated using a local sample , it is possible that the relative fraction of different types evolves with look - back time due to , e.g. , a change in metallicity with time .",
    "this adds to the uncertainty . in section 4 where we discuss systematic errors , we investigate how the uncertainty in the fractions may affect the derived rates .",
    "faint cc sne with magnitudes @xmath4015 may be too faint to be detected even in local surveys such as the lick observatory supernova search ( loss ; li et al .",
    "2011 ) , which goes out to @xmath14 200 mpc .",
    "however , if the intrinsic fraction of faint sne could be determined , then it would be possible to account for this population when deriving the rates .",
    "richardson et al . ( 2002 ) argue that the fraction of faint @xmath4115 cc sne should be at least 20% , perhaps much higher .",
    "this is consistent with the results of cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who estimate that faint 1987a - like sne should be 10%30% of the type ii sne . as a conservative limit on the fraction of faint sne",
    ", we adopt a value of 20% , consistent with the estimate of richardson et al .",
    "the values listed in table [ tab1 ] ( columns 24 ) already result in @xmath144% sne with @xmath4115 when taking into account the dispersions in peak magnitudes . to account for a larger fraction of faint cc sne",
    ", we add a population of sne with peak magnitude @xmath4214.4 , similar to the faint sn 1987a . in order to make the total fraction of faint sne 20%",
    ", we assume that  19% of the sn population is of the faint sn 1987a type .",
    "these fractions are shown in column 6 of table [ tab1 ] .",
    "each of the four main cc sn types is represented by a light curve and a set of seds that changes with time on the light curve .",
    "we base our light curves and spectral library on the templates publicly available at the web site of p. nugent.nugent/nugent_templates.html ]      the detection efficiency of the @xmath30  sn search is described in strolger et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and dahlen et al . (",
    "2008 ) . in short ,",
    "two methods were used to derive the detection efficiency .",
    "first , fake sne of different magnitudes were added to the actual images during the real - time manual searches .",
    "the number of added fake sne was purposely limited to minimize fatigue by the people doing the searches .",
    "second , we used a monte carlo method to plant thousands of false point - spread functions in the data and thereafter tried to recover them using an automated detection algorithm . the monte carlo test can probe a significantly larger parameter space ( combinations of magnitude and host environments ) and is therefore complimentary to the real - time test .",
    "the monte carlo method makes assumptions on the limitations of the manual searches , i.e. , setting a threshold for detection that matches the human searches .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the two methods produce similar results in detection efficiency .",
    "the results from these two methods were averaged to give a final detection efficiency .",
    "the solid line in figure [ fig2 ] shows the derived detection efficiency .",
    "the vertical dashed line shows the cutoff magnitude used when deriving rates . by applying a cutoff",
    "we decrease the need for corrections due to incompleteness at the faintest magnitudes .",
    "even though this cutoff excludes seven sne , the increase in error due to the lower statistics is less than the uncertainties introduced by the incompleteness corrections . also , these are the faintest sne in our sample and may therefore have larger uncertainties in their type determination .",
    "extinction by dust in their host galaxies makes sne fainter and a number of sne which without extinction would be readily detectable may fall below the detection limit of the survey .",
    "even if the peak magnitude is above the detection limit , a fainter sn spends a shorter time on the light curve above the limit and is therefore easier to miss during a search .",
    "correcting for the sne missed due to these extinction effects is essential for deriving accurate rates .",
    "the model used in this investigation to calculate corrections for dust extinction in normal spiral galaxies is based on the models in riello & patat ( 2005 ) .",
    "the model assumes different exponential dust and sn distributions in galaxies .",
    "the effects of the spiral arm structure are considered to be negligible and the sne are assumed to be found in host galaxies with random inclinations .",
    "furthermore , the model requires the specification of a bulge - to - total ( b / t ) ratio .",
    "here we use b / t = 0 .",
    "the resulting distribution of extinction values can be normalized through the face - on central optical depth through the model disk galaxy , @xmath43 .",
    "mattila et al .",
    "( 2012 ) show that @xmath43=2.5 gives a good fit to observed values of host galaxy extinctions within 12 mpc . to further check this , we add the sample in richardson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to the observed sample of host galaxy extinctions in mattila et al .",
    "we find that when using the same criteria as mattila et al .",
    "( including the observed extinctions in galaxies with an inclination less than 60@xmath44 , and excluding two observed sne with high extinction , @xmath45 ) the mean extinction is @xmath46 0.42@xmath47  for our sample of 34 sne .",
    "this is consistent with the predicted value @xmath48 0.44 from the simulations , after using the same inclination restriction and excluding a few objects ( @xmath141% ) with @xmath45  in the high extinction tail of the simulated distribution .    at low redshift ,",
    "most star formation , and therefore also cc sn production , occurs in galaxies with moderate amounts of dust extinction which we assume can be mostly corrected for by the models described above .",
    "we note , however , that while these models do predict a fairly significant tail of high extinction values in inclined host galaxies , they only result in about @xmath49 with high extinction values @xmath45  in galaxies with an inclination less than 60@xmath44 . based on observed data , mattila et al .",
    "( 2012 ) estimate that a fraction of about @xmath1415% may have such high extinction even in these low to intermediate inclination galaxies and are therefore more likely to be missed in searches .",
    "furthermore , the fraction of star formation taking place in highly dust - enshrouded environments , such as lirgs and ulirgs , increases rapidly with redshift ( e.g. , prez - gonzlez et al .",

    "this increases to factors 2.4 and 2.7 in the intermediate- and high - redshift bins , respectively .",
    "the rates calculated for 8 of the 22 search epochs used here were reported in dahlen et al .",

    "point out that the lack of corrections due to inclination effects ( except excluding galaxies with inclination @xmath7775@xmath44 ) leads to the largest uncertainty in their rates , possibly underestimating the results .",

    "this is outside the scope of this paper , but we do leave the rate in this paper because it is one of the first based on a compilation consisting of a significant sample of sne .    when looking at the local rates , it is obvious that there is a trend of decreasing rates as the samples are selected at increasing radii , with deviations between some of the rates being larger than statistical errors .",
    "the trend suggests that more sne may be missed at larger radii , possibly due to extinction in the host galaxies , which , if uncorrected for , may underestimate the rate .",
    "there could also be a relatively high fraction of intrinsically faint sne that would be more easily missed at large radii , which , if not accounted for , would underestimate the derived rates .",

    "at the same time , the error bars on the graur et al . and melinder et al .",

    "additional systematic errors could also be large in those results due to , e.g. , the lack of spectroscopic confirmation of the redshifts of both the sne and the host galaxies . with our new rates , based on the largest high - redshift statistical sample for which we have spectroscopic confirmation of the redshift of the sn or host for a majority of the sample , we are able to significantly decrease the size of the error bars , making it possible to set firmer constraints on the evolution of the cosmic snr",

    "note that the cc snr provides a completely independent method for measuring the evolution of the sfr , compared to other widely used methods based on , e.g. , galaxy luminosity densities ( uv , ir , h@xmath82 , etc . ) . for a direct comparison between the local cc snr and different sfr indicators , see botticella et al .",
    "previous results have shown that the increase in cc snr with look - back time is consistent with an increase in the rate as expected from the sfr ( dahlen et el .",
    "2004 ) . however , the details in the evolution of the cc snr and their normalization to the sfr still have large uncertainties , which has prevented a more detailed comparison .    in figure [ fig4 ]",

    "we can thereafter relate the sfr ( sfr in units of @xmath86yr@xmath10mpc@xmath87 ) and the cc snr ( snr in units of yr@xmath10  mpc@xmath87 ) by @xmath88 where @xmath89 numerically , this results in @xmath61=0.0070 @xmath90 .",
    "there are two main uncertainties in deriving this value .",
    "first , the choice of imf affects the result .",
    "however , the dependency of the imf in equation ( 2 ) is mostly cancelled out since the derived sfr in equation ( 1 ) also depends on the imf .",
    "e.g. , melinder et al .",

    "the second uncertainty comes from the selected range of cc sn progenitor masses . here",
    "we use a lower limit of 8@xmath86  consistent with the results of smartt et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , who estimate that the minimum stellar mass for type iip progenitors lies in the range @xmath91 .",
    "this range corresponds to an uncertainty in @xmath61  by + 22%/23% .",
    "the upper limit ( 50@xmath86 ) is taken from tsujimoto et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who suggest that progenitors more massive than this become black holes directly instead of exploding as sne . due to the steep slope of the imf ,",
    "the actual choice of upper limit has limited impact on the derived @xmath61  value . here",
    "we assume that the upper limit is restricted to the range @xmath92 , resulting in an uncertainty of + 6%/9% .",
    "taking these ranges in upper and lower limits into account , we find that @xmath61  should lie in the range 0.0048@xmath930.0089 , indicating a maximum uncertainly in the normalization by less than @xmath5825% .",
    "we also note that there is an uncertainty in the normalization of the sfr by approximately @xmath1420% ( e.g. , figure 5 in horiuchi et al .",
    "an uncertainly of this order is also illustrated on figure [ fig3 ] as the difference in sfr between the estimates in magnelli et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and horiuchi et al .",
    "therefore , there should still be a total systematic uncertainty of @xmath1432% when comparing the sfr derived from galaxy luminosities and the sfr from cc sne .    using the relation in equation ( 1 )",
    ", we see in figure [ fig4 ] that our newly derived rates well match the predictions from the sfr over the range @xmath94 . indicating that the assumptions made when deriving the rates are not severely affected by systematic errors , and the assumed relation between sfr and snr seems reasonable .",
    "we note that the local rates by botticella et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and mattila et al .",
    "( 2012 ) are also consistent with the expectations from the sfr , even though these rates represent lower limits .",
    "based on the cc snrs published prior to 2011 , horiuchi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) noted that the observed cc snrs and the rates expected from the sfr are systematically offset by a factor of @xmath142 , particularly at lower redshifts .",
    "the main explanations for this discrepancy suggested that a high fraction of cc sne could be missing from the searches due to a significant population of intrinsically faint sne or that a large fraction is invisible to searches since they are hidden behind significant amounts of dust . in this investigation , we take both of these sources into account when deriving rates .",
    "since our results agree well with what is expected from the sfr , it seems likely that the discrepancy in horiuchi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) is indeed due to the factors suggested by the authors . for the other high - redshift rates ,",
    "the inclusion of corrections for sne missed in u / lirgs in the rates of graur et al .",

    "they argue that within 15 mpc , a large fraction of either faint or dust - enshrouded sne should not be missing , which is the reason that their rate is consistent with the sfr .",
    "similar arguments should hold for the rate in botticella et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , even though this rate could be elevated more due to the local overdensity in star formation . for the remaining rates in figure [ fig4 ] that fall below the sfr lines , it is likely that these two effects both contribute to the rates , in combination with unaccounted systematic errors that could affect each different survey .",
    "we finally note that the good agreement between the sfr and the cc snr derived here over the whole redshift range to @xmath311.1 indicates that we are not significantly affected by incompleteness at higher redshifts where the sne become fainter .",

    "<S> we use a sample of 45 core collapse supernovae detected with the advanced camera for surveys on board the _ hubble space telescope _ to derive the core collapse supernova rate in the redshift range @xmath0 . in redshift bins centered on @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> we find rates 3.00@xmath4@xmath5 , 7.39@xmath6@xmath7 , and 9.57@xmath8@xmath9 , respectively , given in units of yr@xmath10mpc@xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the rates have been corrected for host galaxy extinction , including supernovae missed in highly dust - enshrouded environments in infrared bright galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the first errors are statistical while the second ones are the estimated systematic errors . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a detailed discussion of possible sources of systematic errors and note that these start to dominate over statistical errors at @xmath12 , emphasizing the need to better control the systematic effects . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a better understanding of the amount of dust extinction in the host galaxies and knowledge of the supernova luminosity function , in particular the fraction of faint @xmath13  supernovae , is needed to better constrain the rates . </S>",
    "<S> when comparing our results with the core collapse supernova rate based on the star formation rate , we find a good agreement , consistent with the supernova rate following the star formation rate , as expected . </S>"
