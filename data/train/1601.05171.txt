    "cro@xmath0 is a rare example of stoichiometric oxide , which demonstrates metallic and ferromagnetic ( fm ) properties .",
    "it is widely used in magnetic recording and considered as one of the best particulate ever invented for these purposes  @xcite . besides magnetorecording , chromium dioxide has attracted a considerable scientific interest due to its half - metallic electronic structure  @xcite , which is intensively studied today due to its implication in various spin - dependent transport phenomena @xcite .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we have studied the microscopic origin of the half - metallic ferromagnetism in cro@xmath0 by combining first - principles electronic structure calculations with the model hamiltonian approach and modern many - body methods for treating the electron - electron correlations .",
    "we have demonstrated that the problem is indeed highly nontrivial : at the first glance , the ferromagnetism in cro@xmath0 can be easily explained by the hund s rule related exchange processes in the narrow @xmath2 band , located near the fermi level . however , the electron - electron correlations , rigorously treated in the frameworks of dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite , tend to destabilize the fm state .",
    "the ferromagnetism in the stoichiometric cro@xmath0 reemerges only if , besides conventional kinetic energy changes in the @xmath2 band , to consider other mechanism , involving direct exchange and magnetic polarization of the oxygen band .",
    "we have shown how all these contributions can be evaluated using first - principles electronic structure calculations in the local - density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to explore the question : how can one further stabilize the metallic fm state and increase the curie temperature ( @xmath1 ) in cro@xmath0 ?",
    "this is indeed a very important technological and fundamental problem . from the technological point of view , @xmath1 in cro@xmath0 is not exceptionally high ( about @xmath5 k  @xcite ) , so that the magnetic properties at the room temperature are deteriorated by the thermal fluctuations . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the problem is also highly nontrivial because the robustness of the ferromagnetism in cro@xmath0 strongly depends on details of the electronic structure .",
    "indeed , the magnetic properties of cro@xmath0 are predetermined by the behavior of @xmath2 bands , located near the fermi level . in the rutile structure ,",
    "the @xmath2 orbitals belong to different representations of the point group .",
    "therefore , depending on the crystal distortion , one can expect rather dissimilar behavior of these orbital contributions , and hypothetically one can imagine rather different types of the electronic structure , which will stabilize different magnetic states .",
    "for example , if one of the @xmath2 electrons resides on the localized orbital , which forms a narrow band below the fermi level , and polarizes the itinerant electrons in two other nearly degenerate bands ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.modeldos]a ) , one can expect a strong tendency towards ferromagnetism driven by the direct exchange ( de ) mechanism  @xcite .",
    "this scenario for cro@xmath0 , which is reminiscent of the physics of colossal magnetoresistive manganites  @xcite , was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and since then was actively discussed in the literature . from the viewpoint of the de physics ,",
    "the electronic structure depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig.modeldos]a is nearly optimal for stabilizing the fm ground state and if it was indeed realized in cro@xmath0 one could hardly expect any other possibilities for further improving the fm properties of this material",
    ". however , it is only a idealistic picture and in reality there are always some factors , which deteriorate it .",
    "one of them is the crystal - field splitting of the @xmath2 orbitals . as somewhat extreme scenario",
    ", one can imagine the situation when one of the @xmath2 orbitals is split off by the crystal field , while all three @xmath2 the orbitals form the bands of approximately the same bandwidth ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.modeldos]b ) .",
    "as we will see below , such situation could be indeed realized if , instead of cro@xmath0 , one uses the experimental crystal structure of vo@xmath0 . in this case , the system is close to the insulating state , and one can expect antiferromagnetic ( afm ) character of exchange interactions , due to the superexchange mechanism  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , even in this case , the fm ground state can be restored by the hole doping , which partially depopulates the occupied bands and , thus , activates the de mechanism .",
    "such scenario is also frequently realized in the colossal magnetoresistive manganites  @xcite .",
    "then , even in the ideal electronic structure , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig.modeldos]a , one unexplored possibility is the partial depopulation of the `` narrow '' band , formed by more localized @xmath2 orbitals : since it has finite bandwidth , it can also give rise to the de interactions , which will compensate the decrease of the fm interactions , cause by the depopulation of the `` wide '' bands .",
    "thus , the situation is indeed very subtle and depends on the actual ratio of the bandwidths of the `` narrow '' and `` wide '' bands , as well as other interactions , including the afm ones , existing in the system beyond the conventional de limit  @xcite .    in the present work we systematically study the doping - dependence of interatomic exchange interactions in cro@xmath0 , by using the effective low - energy electron model for the @xmath2 bands , derived from the first - principles electronic structure calculations , and solving it by means of dmft .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , we will briefly discuss our method of construction of the effective low - energy electron model , the solution of this model by using the dynamical mean - field theory , and the theory of infinitesimal spin rotations for calculations of interatomic exchange interactions  @xcite .",
    "then , in sec .  [ sec : results ] , we will present our results .",
    "particularly , we will discuss the doping - dependence of interatomic exchange interactions and explain how it is related to the electronic structure of cro@xmath0 in dmft .",
    "after that , we will use the obtained parameters of exchange interactions in order to evaluate the curie temperature and find the optimal concentration of @xmath2 electrons ( @xmath3 ) , which maximizes @xmath1 .",
    "we will also discuss the effect of the crystal structure on this doping dependence by considering the experimental rutile structure of cro@xmath0 and vo@xmath0 and argue that in both cases the optimal @xmath3 is close to @xmath4 . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] , we will present a brief summary of our work .",
    "in this section , we briefly remind the reader the main steps of our approach . more details can be found in ref .",
    "all calculations have been performed using parameters of the experimental rutile structure ( the space group @xmath6 ) for cro@xmath0 @xcite and vo@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the first step is the construction of the effective hubbard - type model for the magnetically active @xmath2 bands : @xmath7 starting from the band structure in lda .",
    "the model itself is formulated in the basis of wannier functions , which were obtained using the projector - operator technique  @xcite and the orthonormal linear muffin - tin orbitals ( lmto s ) @xcite as the trial wave functions .",
    "@xmath10/@xmath11 in ( [ eqn.manybodyh ] ) are the spin indices , while @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 label three @xmath2 orbitals , which have the following form in the global coordinate frame : @xmath16@xmath17@xmath18@xmath19@xmath20@xmath21 , @xmath22@xmath23@xmath24 , and @xmath25@xmath20@xmath26 , where two signs correspond to two cr ( v ) sites in the primitive cell . since three @xmath2 orbitals belong to different irreducible representations of the point group @xmath27 , all local quantities , including the dmft self - energy and local green s function , are diagonal with respect to the orbital indices .",
    "the indices @xmath28 and @xmath29 specify the positions of the cr ( v ) atoms in the lattice .",
    "the parameters of the one - electron part , @xmath30 $ ] , are defined as the matrix elements of the lda hamiltonian in the wannier basis @xcite .",
    "the parameters of screened on - site coulomb interactions , @xmath31 $ ] , are calculated in the framework of constrained random - phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite , using the simplified procedure , which is explained in ref .",
    "the parameters of the model hamiltonian , obtained for cro@xmath0 and vo@xmath0 , are summarized in table  [ tab.parameters ] .",
    "@ccc & cro@xmath0 & vo@xmath0 + @xmath32 & @xmath33 & @xmath34 + @xmath35 & @xmath36 & @xmath37 + @xmath38 & @xmath39 & @xmath40 + @xmath41 & @xmath42 & @xmath43 + @xmath44 & @xmath45 & @xmath46 +    after the construction , the model ( [ eqn.manybodyh ] ) was solved by means of the dmft @xcite , where the properties of the many - electron system are formally related to the frequency - dependent self - energy @xmath47 , which describes all kind of correlation effects in the one - electron green s function @xmath48 ( in the reciprocal @xmath49-space ) : @xmath50^{-1}. \\label{eqn.latticeg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the basic approximation here is that @xmath47 does not depend on @xmath49 , which becomes exact in the limit of infinite dimensions ( or coordination numbers ) .",
    "the main idea of dmft is to map the initial many - body problem for the crystalline lattice onto the quantum impurity one , surrounded by an effective electronic bath , and find parameters of green s function of this bath , @xmath51 , by solving the anderson impurity model .",
    "for these purposes we employ the newly developed exact diagonalization scheme .",
    "the details can be found in refs .",
    "then , @xmath47 is obtained from the dyson equation : @xmath52 where @xmath53 , and the problem is solved self - consistently .",
    "after the solution of the dmft problem , we consider the mapping of the electron model ( [ eqn.manybodyh ] ) onto the spin heisenberg model : @xmath54 in these notations , @xmath55 is the exchange coupling between two cr ( v ) sites , located in the origin ( @xmath56 ) and in the point @xmath28 of the lattice , relative to the origin , and @xmath57 is the direction of the spin moment at the site @xmath29 ( while the value of the spin itself is included in the definition of @xmath55 ) .",
    "the mapping onto the spin model implies the adiabatic motion of spins when all instantaneous changes of the electronic structure adjust slow rotations of the spin magnetic moments .",
    "then , the parameters of this model can be obtained by using the theory of infinitesimal spin rotations near the fm state  @xcite : @xmath58 where @xmath59^{-1}_{0i}$ ] is the one - electron green function between sites @xmath56 and @xmath28 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 denotes the trace over the orbital indices .",
    "in fact , the parameters @xmath62 given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : jij ] ) are proportional to the second derivatives of the total energy with respect to the infinitesimal rotations of spins  @xcite .",
    "thus , these parameters characterize the local stability of the magnetic state .",
    "first , let us explain the behavior of nearest - neighbor ( nn ) exchange interaction , @xmath63 , which for cro@xmath0 exhibits a nonmonotonous behavior with a peak at around @xmath64 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.cro2ji ] ) . due to the @xmath65 symmetry of the nn bond @xmath66 ,",
    "the matrices of transfer integrals , @xmath35 , and green s function , @xmath67 , are diagonal with respect to the orbital indices . therefore , @xmath63 is the superposition of three individual contributions originating from the three @xmath2 orbitals . due to the de mechanism , which largely controls the behavior of @xmath63 , each contribution",
    "is expected to have a maximum near the half - filling and then decrease with the decrease of @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "therefore , near @xmath68 , where the @xmath10-spin band , formed by the orbital @xmath4 , is nearly fully populated while the bands @xmath69 and @xmath70 are approximately half - filled ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.dos ] ) , @xmath63 decrease with the decrease of @xmath3 .",
    "however , then the orbital @xmath4 is gradually depopulated and becomes half - filled at around @xmath64 .",
    "this explain the appearance of the additional peak around @xmath64 ( fig .",
    "[ fig.jpartial ] ) .    indeed , the transfer integral between orbitals of the type @xmath4 in the bond @xmath66 is moderately strong ( see table  [ tab.parameters ] )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can expect relatively large fm de contribution and weak ( in comparison with other orbitals ) afm contribution to the exchange coupling , which appears in the next order of the @xmath71 expansion  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 electrons , occupying the orbital @xmath4 in cro@xmath0 , are sometimes considered as the localized ones and participating only in the formation of the weakly afm background ( similar to @xmath2 electrons in manganites  @xcite ) , while the ferromagnetism is entirely related to the itinerant electrons in the bands , formed by the orbitals @xmath69 and @xmath70  @xcite . as we have seen , such interpretation is not quiet correct and the orbital @xmath4 can also substantially contribute to the ferromagnetism , at least in the case of the hole doping .    for the next - nn bond @xmath72 ,",
    "the transfer integrals are strongly off - diagonal with respect to the orbitals indices ( see table  [ tab.parameters ] ) .",
    "moreover , the matrix element @xmath73 is small .",
    "therefore , the contribution of the orbital @xmath4 to @xmath74 will be also small and entangled with other orbitals .",
    "in such situation , the behavior of @xmath74 is mainly controlled by the population of the orbitals @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "this is the main reason why @xmath74 monotonously decrease with the decrease of @xmath3 .",
    "the behavior of longer - range interactions is more complex .",
    "very generally , one can expect that the more remote are the sites , the more oscillations will have the exchange coupling between them depending on @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "this tendency is indeed observed in our dmft calculations ( see fig .  [ fig.cro2ji ] ) : while @xmath63 and @xmath74 remain fm for @xmath75 , several long - range interactions change their sign .",
    "particularly , the interactions @xmath76-@xmath77 are afm at @xmath68 , but gradually become fm with the decrease of @xmath3 .",
    "the strongest effect is observed for @xmath78 and @xmath79 , which reach the maximum at around @xmath80 .",
    "this behavior is also related to the partial depopulation of the @xmath10-spin band , formed by the orbital @xmath4 , while the contribution of two other orbitals is considerably weaker ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.jpartial ] ) .",
    "thus , while for @xmath68 the fm state in our model is unstable ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.tc ] ) , one can expect a strong ferromagnetism around @xmath64 , mainly as the joint effect of @xmath63 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "note that in our model , we do not consider the contributions caused by direct exchange interactions and the polarization of the oxygen band , which are indeed crucial for stabilizing the fm ground state in cro@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "however , it is reasonable to expect that the doping - dependence of these interactions is relatively weak , because the doping mainly affects the magnetic interactions in the @xmath2 band .",
    "therefore , we do not consider here the direct exchange interactions as well as the effects of magnetic polarization of the oxygen band , assuming that , if necessary , these ( independent on the doping ) fm contributions can be simply added to the ones in the @xmath2 band , which we explore in the present work .    in order to discuss the band - filling dependence of @xmath1",
    ", we evaluate two quantities , which are related to it .",
    "the first one is the sum of exchange interactions around some central site , @xmath81 , which is proportional to the mean - field estimate for @xmath1 .",
    "the second one is the actual value of @xmath1 for the spin model ( [ eqn.sh ] ) , evaluated using tyablikov s rpa @xcite .",
    "the results are explained in fig .",
    "[ fig.tc ] .",
    "the definition of @xmath1 is only meaningful when the fm state is stable . in tyablikov s",
    "approach , this is defined by the magnon frequencies @xmath82 : if some of @xmath82 are negative , the fm state is considered to be unstable .",
    "these regions of stability ( and instability ) of the fm state are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.tc ] .",
    "@xmath83 and @xmath1 reach the maximums at around @xmath84 @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively . the maximal value of @xmath1 is about @xmath87 k , which is indeed very high .",
    "finally , we discuss the effect of the crystal structure on the considered properties . for these purposes , instead of cro@xmath0",
    ", we take the experimental crystal structure of vo@xmath0 and perform the same calculations . indeed ,",
    "if the optimal band - filling in cro@xmath0 is around @xmath64 , one can also try to consider the possibility of the electron or hole doping of vo@xmath0 .",
    "the obtained band - filling dependence of interatomic exchange interactions in vo@xmath0 is explained in fig .",
    "[ fig.vo2ji ] and corresponding densities of states are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.dos ] .",
    "judging from the parameters of the model hamiltonian ( see table  [ tab.parameters ] ) , the main difference between cro@xmath0 and vo@xmath0 is in the transfer integrals operating in the nn bond @xmath66 : in cro@xmath0 , the transfer integrals between orbitals of the type @xmath4 are considerably weaker than those between orbitals @xmath69 and @xmath70 , while in vo@xmath0 all three types are comparable .",
    "this explains the fact that all three @xmath10-spin bands , formed by the orbitals @xmath4-@xmath70 , are comparable in the case of vo@xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.dos ] ) , while in cro@xmath0 the band @xmath4 is considerably narrower .",
    "moreover , the crystal field , separating the orbital @xmath70 , is considerably stronger in the case of vo@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath68 in vo@xmath0 , the @xmath10-spin bands @xmath4 and @xmath69 are nearly filled ( or half - filled in the non - spin - polarized case ) , while the band @xmath70 is almost empty .",
    "this explain the afm character of nn interaction @xmath63 at @xmath68 , as the general tendency towards antiferromagnetism near the half - filling ( referring to the bands @xmath4 and @xmath69 in the non - spin - polarized case ) @xcite",
    ". however , the decrease of @xmath3 leads to the partial depopulation of the @xmath10-spin bands @xmath4 and @xmath69 , which changes the character of the nn interaction @xmath63 towards the fm one due to the de mechanism .",
    "this fm coupling is especially strong around @xmath88 .",
    "the relative strength of long - range interactions is considerably weaker .",
    "thus these interactions play a less important role in comparison with cro@xmath0 .",
    "the mean - field hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations , performed for the fm state of vo@xmath0 , yield @xmath89 mev and @xmath90 mev .",
    "these values are somewhat larger than the ones obtained in the dmft ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 mev , respectively ) due to the lack of dynamic correlations , which effectively decrease the intraatomic exchange splitting between majority- and minority - spin states near the fermi level and , thus , additionally strengthens the afm superexchange interactions in the case of dmft  @xcite . nevertheless , both hf calculations and dmft support strong fm character of exchange interactions in vo@xmath0 , if they are calculated near the fm state .",
    "it is also important to note that the electronic structure and exchange interactions in vo@xmath0 exhibit the strong dependence on the magnetic state in which they are calculated ( and in this sense , vo@xmath0 can be regarded as a _ smart material _",
    "for instance , in the hf calculations , the afm alignment of two v spins in the primitive cell opens the band gap ( of about @xmath93 ev ) and changes the character of nn interactions to the afm one ( @xmath94@xmath95 mev ) .",
    "this afm configuration is higher in energy ( and , thus , can not be realized as the ground state ) .",
    "however , it can contribute to the thermodynamic average at elevated temperatures .",
    "thus , the fm ground state obtained for the rutile structure of vo@xmath0 is not inconsistent with the negative curie - weiss temperature , expected from the high - temperature behavior of magnetic susceptibility  @xcite : simply , the electronic structure of the paramagnetic state should be very different from the one realized in the fm ground state and , therefore , the magnetic interactions should be also different .    using parameters of exchange interactions , obtained in dmft , we again evaluate the `` mean - field parameter '' @xmath83 and the curie temperature , using tyablikov s rpa .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig.tc ] . despite substantial differences in the electronic structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.dos ] ) , the curie temperature exhibits very similar behavior as the function of the band - filling in cro@xmath0 and vo@xmath0 . in the latter case ,",
    "@xmath83 and @xmath1 take the maximum at around @xmath84 @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "the maximal value of @xmath1 is close to @xmath87 k , i.e. similar to cro@xmath0 .",
    "by combining first - principles electronic structure calculations with the dynamical mean - field theory , we have investigated the band - filling dependence of interatomic exchange interactions and the curie temperature in cro@xmath0 and related rutile compounds .",
    "we have argued that @xmath1 in the rutile compounds can be substantially increased by controlling the number of the @xmath2 electrons .",
    "it appears that , as far as the curie temperature is concerned , the filling of the @xmath2 band , which is realized in the stoichiometric cro@xmath0 , is not the most optimal one and much higher @xmath1 can be expected for the smaller number of the @xmath2 electrons due to the general tendency of narrow - band compounds towards the ferromagnetism at the beginning and the end of the band - filling  @xcite .",
    "according to our estimates , the optimal number of @xmath2 electrons should be close to @xmath64 , which formally corresponds to vo@xmath0 .",
    "thus , if vo@xmath0 indeed crystallized in the rutile structure , it could be a good fm material with some of the properties even exceeding cro@xmath0",
    ". however , below @xmath98 k , vo@xmath0 undergoes the transition to the monoclinic phase , which is accompanied by the dimerization of the v sites and the formation of the nonmagnetic insulating state  @xcite . actually , the situation when the robust ferromagnetism , expected in some materials , is destroyed by the lattice distortion is rather common in nature .",
    "one of the well known examples is lamno@xmath99 , which from the viewpoint of the de physics is expected to be a strong ferromagnet with the optimal concentration of electrons in the partially filled @xmath100 band  @xcite .",
    "however , this fm state in lamno@xmath99 is destroyed by the jahn - teller distortion , which is responsible for the formation of the layered afm state  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the fm state can be realized in the thin films , where the crystal structure is controlled by the substrate .",
    "such a possibility for vo@xmath0 was indeed demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it was argued that by deposing vo@xmath0 on different substrates one can achieve the room - temperature ferromagnetism , which can be switched ` on ' and ` off ' , depending on the treatment conditions .",
    "this behavior was attributed to the v@xmath101 defects , existing in the thin films of vo@xmath0 .",
    "however , results of our work demonstrate that such behavior can be also intrinsic and related to the general tendency towards the ferromagnetism in the narrow - band compounds at the beginning of the band filling .",
