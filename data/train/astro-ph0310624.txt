    "the electron - ion recombination process is unified in nature .",
    "it involves both resonant and non - resonant components that are inseparable in principle and always occur together , analgous to those in the complementary physical processes of electron - ion scattering and photoionization .",
    "experiments or observations of recombination measure the _ total _ cross section . theoretically therefore a unified treatment with a self - consistent approach",
    "is preferable to methods that consider recombination in parts employing different approximations of varying validity .",
    "historically , recombination is usually considered in two main but separate parts : ( a ) radiative recombination ( rr ) i.e. direct radiative capture and recombination , @xmath1 and dielectronic recombination ( dr ) i.e. indirect capture and recombination through autoionizing states , @xmath2 where the intermediate state ( indicated by double asterisks ) is a doubly excited state of the ( e + ion ) system which introduces a resonance",
    ".    the subject of electron - ion recombination has been one of the most active areas of research in atomic physics for several decades , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "traditionally the two parts , rr and dr , are treated independently .",
    "the rr cross sections are obtained in a straightforward manner using detailed balance ( milne relation ) from ground state photoionization cross sections computed using relatively simple approximations such as the central field or the quantum defect method ( burgess & seaton , 1960 ) , without taking account of resonances . on the other hand",
    "the theoretical treatment of dr has a long and interesting history ( seaton & storey , 1976 , hahn & lagattuta 1988 ) .",
    "the main development was the realization by burgess ( 1964 ) that dr via the infinite series of resonances in the system is an important contributor to the total recombination process .",
    "the celebrated general burgess formula was used in many applications , particularly in astrophysical modeling .",
    "more accurate treatments of dr , generally based on the isolated resonance approximation using the distorted wave method , were later developed taking account of physical effects not included in the burgess formula , such as autoionization into excited levels ( e.g. jacobs 1977 ) .",
    "nussbaumer and storey ( 1983 ) pointed out the importance of low - energy resonances that might give significant enhancement of the dr rate in the low - temperature region .",
    "hahn ( 1985 ) provided expressions for dr cross sections for comparison with experiments .",
    "there are many calculations for dielectronic recombination ( dr ) with highly charged ions ( e.g. pindzola 1990,1992 ; badnell 1990 ) , using not only the distorted wave method also others such as the saddle point variation method ( mannervik 1997 ) , that yield good agreement with experimental data for the ions considered .    in recent years a number of pioneering experimental studies have been carried out .",
    "experimental measurements of electron - ion recombination cross sections using ion storage rings exhibit detailed resonance structures at very high resolution in beam energy ( e.g. wolf 1991 , kilgus 1990,1993 , mannervik 1997 , schippers 1999 ) .",
    "the experiments measure absolute cross sections and therefore provide ideal tests for theoretical methods , as well as the physical effects included in the calculations . in light of the new experimental studies however , and given that the unified method for electron - ion recombination is quite general , it is desirable to extend the calculations to elicit detailed features for direct comparison with the measured cross sections .",
    "one of the goals of the present article is to demonstrate the accuracy of the method , on par with the r - matrix treatment of photoionization and electron impact excitation , as well as to study theoretical issues such as relativistic effects , the distinction between close coupling and independent resonance treatments , the magnitude of the resonant and the non - resonant ( background ) cross sections , relatively sparse near - threshold resonance structures as opposed to the dense resonances below the rydberg series limits , radiation damping of low - lying autoionizing resonances , etc .    in the present work we describe photoionization , elctron - ion scattering , and recombination self - consistently within the framework of the close coupling approximation using the r - matrix method . combining eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , and invoking detailed balance , we may write    @xmath3    where photoionization and recombination ( resonant @xmath4 non - resonant ) proceed inversely in either direction . the wavefunctions for the ( e + ion ) system are obtained with the same eigenfunction expansion for both processes , enabling a self - consistent treatment in an ab initio manner .",
    "the r - matrix package of codes has been extended to incorporate the theoretical framework described below .",
    "the r - matrix method developed by p.g .",
    "burke and associates ( burke and robb 1975 , burke and berrington 1993 ) provides a natural and powerful tool for collisional and radiative electron - ion processes based on the close coupling or coupled channel ( cc ) approximation .",
    "in particular , the r - matrix method has been employed for large - scale computations using efficient codes developed under the opacity project ( the opacity project 1995,1996 , seaton 1987 , berrington 1987 , seaton 1994 ) , and the iron project ( hummer 1993 , berrington 1995 ) .",
    "most of these calculations entail photoionization and electron - ion scattering , the two processes that form the basis of the present extension of the r - matrix method to unified recombination ( nahar and pradhan 1992,1994,1995,1997 , zhang and pradhan 1997 , zhang 1999 ) .    in the following subsections",

    "solutions of the schrodinger equation , @xmath20 which becomes a set of coupled equations with the cc expansion , give the bound wavefunctions , @xmath21 , for negative energies ( e @xmath22 0 ) , and continuun wavefunction , @xmath23 , for positive energies ( e @xmath24 0 ) .",
    "the transition matrix elements for various atomic processes are : @xmath25 for photoionization and recombination , @xmath26 for oscillator strength , @xmath27 for electron impact excitation , where * d * is the dipole operator , @xmath28 in `` length '' form and @xmath29 in `` velocity '' form with the sum over the number of electrons .",
    "the matrix elements are divided into inner and outer region components corresponding to the r - matrix boundary at a suitably chosen radius ( r = a ) , and asymptotic wavefuctions for r @xmath30 .",

    "the photoionization cross section ( @xmath35 ) is proportional to the generalized line strength ( @xmath36 ) , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the statistical weight factor of the initial state .",
    "the total recombination cross section is the sum of cross sections for recombination into the infinite number of recombined levels of the system , as illustrated schematically in fig .  1 .",
    "we divide this infinite set into 3 groups : ( i ) recombination into low - n levels with @xmath39 , ( ii ) contribution from high - n resonances to bound levels with @xmath40 ( dr only ) , and ( iii )  top - up \" background contribution from @xmath41 ( rr only ) . the is chosen such that all three subsets are independent and complementary .",

    "the dominant dr contribution from the energy region below series limits due to radiation damping of high - resonances of group ( ii ) , with @xmath53 , is considered using the bs theory as described above .",
    "generally , for low - resonances of group ( i ) we do not expect radiation damping to be an important consideration since the autionization rates are much larger than radiative decay rates .",
    "however , in some cases the effect could be significant and the low - resonance structures in the detailed photoionization cross sections need to be resolved and damped .",
    "although radiation damping of resonances in electron - ion interactions has been studied for a long time , the effect has been found to be important only for highly charged h - like and he - like ions where the 2p @xmath95 1s and the 1s2p @xmath96s dipole transitions respectively , correspond to radiative decay probabilities @xmath97 , of the order of @xmath98 , approaching typical autoionization rates @xmath99 . employing the branching ratio between autoionization and radiative decay channels ( bates and massey 1943 , burgess 1964 , presnyakov and urnov 1975 ) , pradhan ( 1981 ) showed dr may result in a significant reduction in the autoionization contribution to electron - ion scattering cross section .",
    "it was further pointed out that the flux lost from electron impact excitation ( eie ) is equal to the dr contribution ; detailed calculations were presented for he - like ovii and fexxv .",

    "the effect on eie of the radiative decay of _ low - n _ resonances is small .",
    "following pradhan s work , trefftz ( 1983 ) studied several ionic systems and found that  this effect is important only in certain cases of which highly charged he - like ions are the most prominent \" .",
    "radiative decay of low - resonances in photoionization cross sections , relevant to recombination , is studied using two methods .",
    "the first , due to sakimoto ( 1990 ) , entails fitting the dipole matrix element to a form @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the resonance position and @xmath99 is the autoionization width in ry . the radiative decay width @xmath97 is then obtained by @xmath103 the _ second order _ radiative effects",

    "resonances and radiation damping in photoionization and photo - recombination may also be considered in the relativistic distorted - wave ( rdw ) approximation ( sampson and zhang 1995 ) accurate for highly charged ions . using oscillator strengths or the radiation rates calculated by the dirac - fock - slater ( dfs ) structure program ( sampson 1989 ) , and autoionization rates by the rdw program ,",

    "they found approximately 10 - 20% agreement between calculated dielectronic - resonance strengths for the kll group of resonances in recombination with fe  xxv , and the corresponding values derived experimentally by beiersdorfer ( 1992 ) , and other calculations .",
    "in general our studies have shown that with the exception of ions with h - like and he - like core transitions , radiative decay of low - resonances do not show an appreciable effect on effective recombination cross sections ( except in isolated or small energy ranges ) or rate coefficients ( e.g. zhang 2001 ) .      at very low electron energies and temperatures the recombination",
    "is dominated by radiative recombination to very high - n states just below the ground state of the recombining ion .",

    "we present a wide range of results for ions of varying complexity to demonstrate the generality of the self - consistent unified method , and physical interrelationships among complementary processes of photoionization , recombination , and excitation .      as a test of the accuracy and resolution of the recombination cross sections and photoionization cross sections using the self - consistent approach based on the r - matrix method , we have carried out a number of detailed comparisons for both recombination and photoionization with available experiments discussed in the following section .",
    "very high resolution experimental cross sections are now being measured for recombination on heavy ion synchrotron storage rings , the test storage ring ( tsr ) in heidelberg , and cryring in stockholm .",
    "experimental verification of the unified recombination cross sections , with those measured in detail on ion storage rings , has been done for several ( recombined ) ions for which experimental data is available : c  iii ( mannervik 1998 , schippers 2001 ) , c  iv , c  v , o  vii ( zhang 1999 ) , ar  xiii ( zhang and pradhan 1997 ) , fe  xvii ( savin 1999 ) .",
    "2 demonstrates recombination to ne - like fe  xvii ( pradhan 2001 , zhang 2001 ) with a bprm calculation that includes only the first three levels @xmath123 levels in the eigenfunction expansion of the recombining ion f - like fe  xviii .",
    "the main dr contributions arise from the two @xmath124 = 0 dipole transitions within the core ion .",
    "the computed rate coefficients agree with the sum of rr and experimentally derived dr rate coefficients ( savin 1999 ) to within 20% .",
    "a more extensive multi - configuration expansion up to the @xmath0 = 3 levels of fe  xviii , with 5 spectroscopic configurations @xmath125 , is in progress .",
    "these calculations will also include the @xmath126 dipole transitions that give rise to large resonances structures in the = 2 to 3 range , as found by zhang ( 2001 ) .",
    "another set of relativistic close coupling bprm calculations ( pradhan 2001 ) compared the unified recombination cross sections for recombination from li - like c  iv to be - like c  iii with two different ion storage experiments , on cryring ( mannervik 2001 ) and tsr ( scippers 2001 ) .",
    "of particular interest in this case was the presence of large autoionizing @xmath127 resonances in the near - threshold region .",
    "the effective integrated value of the unified cross sections over this resonance complex lies between the two sets of experimental values , and agrees with both to about 15% .",
    "3 shows the detailed comparison of the bprm results with the tsr data over the region covered by the experiement .",
    "schippers had earlier found that the previous ls coupling calculations for carbon and nitrogen ions ( nahar and pradhan 1997 ) gave total c  iii rate coefficients that agreed with the sum of rr and experimental dr rate coefficients to within experimental uncertainties for all temperatures t @xmath128 5000 k. the discrepancy at lower temperatures was due to the @xmath127 complex , as discussed in detail by mannervik ( 1998 ) and pradhan ( 2001 ) , and resolved by the higher accuracy bprm calculations shown in fig .",
    "new advances have been made recently in measurements of photoionization cross sections with unprecedented resolution by three experimental groups : the university of nevada , reno , with the advanced light source at berkeley , aarhus university , and university of paris - sud .",
    "all three experimental groups have compared their measured data with theoretical r - matrix calculations for several carbon and oxygen ions ( e.g. kjeldsen 1999 , covington 2001 , nahar 2003 ) , as well as for heavier systems such as fe  ii ( kjeldsen 2002 ) and fe  iv ( r. phaneuf , in progress ) .",
    "4 shows a sample comparison between theory and experiment .    of great interest",
    "is the comparison between theory and experiments to ascertain the mixture of ions in the ground and metastable levels in the experimental beam .",
    "the signature of metastable levels manifests itself in experimental data as resonances that appear _ below _ the ground state ionization threshold , since the metastable levels are photoionized at lower energies .",
    "theoretical photoionization cross sections for the ground and metastable levels are therefore weighted and combined in order to compare with and interpret experimental measurements .",
    "this is likely to be of considerable importance in practical applications in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas where metastable levels may be significantly populated .",
    "the level of sophistication of the state - of - the - art theoretical and experimental works on photoionization and recombination is evident from the examples in this section ( and cited references ) .",
    "however , it needs to be emphasized that while theoretical calculations are capable of matching experimental accuracy and resolution , and vice versa , some physical effects and processes deserve careful consideration , as discussed later .",
    "the cc approximation is especially designed for strongly coupled systems . among the most difficult r - matrix calculations",
    "are those for low ionization stages of iron .",
    "hitherto , most of the work has been done in ls coupling since bprm calculations are , as yet , intractable unless their scope is quite limited . in several previous calculations ,",
    "the unified method has been applied to photoionization and recombination cross sections and rate coefficients for fe  i  v ( see bautista and pradhan for references ) .",
    "the cc expansions include all ls terms of the ground and excited even parity configuration of the recombining ion , and the first excited odd parity configuration that enables dipole transitions in the core .",
    "the photoionization cross sections , @xmath35 , are calculated including autoionizing resonances that can enhance the background cross sections considerably . fig .",
    "5 shows the photoionization cross sections of the gound states of fe  i to fe  v. extensive resonances dominate the cross sections for these complex ions .",
    "the differences with previous calculations , indicating resonance enhancement due to extensive channel couplings , are up to three orders of magnitude for fe i , over an order or magnitude for fe ii , and @xmath129 50% for fe iii .",
    "the primary reason for the differences with simpler approximations , such as the central field approximation , that neglect channel couplings , is due to the dominant role of the @xmath130-shell in photoionization of these fe ions , relative to the much smaller cross section of the outer @xmath131 electrons with increasing energy .",
    "cc calculations are therefore essential to obtain accurate cross sections for these fe - ions , and indeed for all neutral and low ionization states of elements .",
    "it is remarkable however that the earlier many - body perturbation theory calculations for fe  i by kelly ( 1972 , dashed line in fig .",
    "5 ) show some similar structures as the r - matrix cross sections .",
    "the recombination rate coefficients for fe  i  -  v are shown in fig .",
    "these were computed using photoionization cross sections for the ground state ( fig .",
    "5 ) , and typically a few hundred excited bound states .",
    "the cc expansion for the recombining ion included target states of configurations denoted as @xmath132 .",
    "for instance the target expansion for photoionization and recombination of fe ii : ( e  +  fe  iii ) @xmath133 fe  ii + h@xmath57 , employ an 83-ls term expansion for core ion fe  iii with configurations @xmath134 ( nahar and pradhan 1994 ) .",
    "the low - energy resonance structures are well represented , as seen in fig .",
    "5 , including the dipole @xmath135 transitions responsible for dr .",
    "therefore at low - temperatures @xmath136 k the unified should be quite accurate .",
    "we find considerable differences with previous works on rr and dr of fe ions .",
    "for example , the fe  i the unified recombination rate is up to a factor of 4 higher at low temperatures than the sum of rr and dr rate coefficients from woods ( 1981 ) .    owing to the size of the computational problem , the much higher energy @xmath137 core transitions were not included in the cc expansion for the target ions .",
    "this likely accounts for the discrepancy in the higher temperature range from the dr bump in .",
    "in fact there are two competing effects : enhancement due to the @xmath138 dr , and reduction due to autoionization into many excited states present below the high - lying @xmath139 levels .",
    "more extensive calculations are needed to fully study this issue .",
    "fine structure also needs to be considered in order to obtain higher accuracy low - energy cross sections and .",
    "table 1 gives the unified for fe  i-  v in the low - temperature region where they are usually abundant in plasmas .",
    "also given in table 1 are sample from recent works for some other iron ions .",
    "the unified method , based on the cc approximation , is possibly the only method capable of accurate results for neutral and low ionization states of elements , where a separate treatment of rr and dr is unphysical and inaccurate .",
    "the r - matrix method for recombination is of course equally valid and accurate for highly charged ions where a separation between the background and resonances is easier , and the sum of individual rr and dr rate coefficients may be of sufficient accuracy .",
    "table 1 also gives the total unified for a few highly ionized iron ions , displaying the full range of ionization states from fe  i to fe  xxv ( rate coefficients for h - like fe  xxvi are given for completeness and comparison ) .",

    "7 shows a typical dr collision strength with high(@xmath140 ) resonances .",
    "these calculations employ the same wavefunction expansion as the detailed photoionization / photorecombination calculations for all possible low-(slj ) levels with @xmath39 .",
    "one of the main physical features of the present approach , self - consistent treatment of photoionization and recombination , is exemplified by the relationship between photoexcitation - of - core ( pec ) resonances and the inverse process of dr .",
    "photoionization of bound levels along a rybderg series exhibit large pec resonances at series limits corresponding to dipole transitions in the core ion ( yu and seaton 1987 , nahar and pradhan 1992 ) .",
    "the pecs generally attenuate the cross section by orders of magnitude relative to the background .",
    "8 illustrates the pec resonances in the photoionization of a rydberg series of excited bound levels of fe  xvii .",
    "the first noteworthy point is that the huge rise in the cross section occurs in what is otherwise expected to be hydrogenic behavior , since the photoionized levels belong to a rydberg series for a given @xmath141 or @xmath142 symmetry of the system ; the higher the value the more outstanding the pec feature .",
    "this also points to the fact that photoionization of excited levels of a non - hydrogenic ion may _ not _ be treated in hydrogenic approximation , as is often done in practical plasma applications .",
    "the inverse of pec is dr .",
    "electrons that excite the core ion may be captured into high - autoionizing resonances , which subsequently decay radiatively to corresponding high - bound levels of the system .",
    "such excitations generally involve strong dipole transitions in the core and pec resonances occur at photon energies equal to these transitions .",
    "the unified recombination rate coefficients are valid over a wide range of temperatures for all practical purposes . in contrast , separate calculation of rr and dr rate coefficients are carried out in different approximations valid for limited temperature ranges , such as low - temperature dr , high - temperature dr , and rr .",
    "moreover , division is sometimes made between @xmath143 and @xmath144 transitions in dr ( savin 1999 ) .",
    "the unified cross sections generally cover all temperature ranges , with cross sections computed over extended energy ranges .",
    "however , the main problem with separate treatment of rr and dr is more fundamental .",
    "even if the dr treatment is satisfactory , the calculation of rr rate coefficient would require the calculation of unphysical photoionization cross sections _ without resonances _ , computed in simpler approximations , such as the central field method that does not include resonances , or a  one - channel \" r - matrix calculation ( gorczyca 2002 ) that contradicts the cc approach which , by definition , incorporates the necessary physics of channel coupling as manifested in resonances . a self - consistent and physical treatment to recombination is enabled by the use of cc wavefunctions employed in the unified approach .      the present close - coupling treatment of ( electron - ion )",
    "recombination is an unified and integrated approach to photorecombination ( pr ) , dr , and electron impact excitation ( eie ) .",
    "9 illustrates the inter - relationships required by conservation - of - flux and unitarity conditions for pr , dr , and eie for the ( e  +  c  vi ) @xmath95 c  v system ( zhang 1999 ) .",
    "the cross sections for all three processes , computed independently but with the same cc wavefunction expansion , are continuous functions of energy .",
    "the pr cross sections include the background non - resonant contribution as well as the resonances ( left of the dashed line in fig .",
    "9 ) , whereas the dr cross sections ( right of the dashed line ) , computed using the bs theory , neglect the background contribution .",
    "the two cross sections , the pr and dr , match smoothly at @xmath145 showing that the background contribution is negligible compared to the resonant contribution at high @xmath146 .",
    "further , the dr cross sections rise exactly up to the eie cross section at the threshold of excitation according to the theoretical condition at threshold    @xmath147    the dr cross section in fig .",
    "9 at the series limit @xmath148 agrees precisely with the independently determined value of the electron impact excitation cross section ( filled circle ) for the dipole transition @xmath149 , as required by the unitarity condition for the generalized @xmath36-matrix and conservation of flux .",
    "the continuous transition between the pr , dr , and eie cross sections serves to validate the accuracy of the bs theory of dr .",
    "the dr cross sections are , on the one hand , consistent with an extensively detailed coupled channel treatment of photorecombination , until an energy region where background recombination is insignificant , and , on the other hand , consistent with the threshold behaviour at the eie threshold .",
    "in fact eq .  (",
    "27 ) provides a powerful accuracy check on the possible importance of long range multipole potentials , partial wave summation , level degeneracies at threshold , and other numerical inaccuracies ( discussed in previous works ) .",
    "the radiatively damped cross sections in fig .",
    "9 illustrate that , owing to the interaction with the radiation field , the autoionizing resonances are broadened , smeared , and wiped out ( in that order ) as @xmath150 . at",
    "sufficiently high-@xmath0 the resonant contribution ( dr ) is very large compared to the background , non - resonant photorecombination ( pr ) cross section . in the unified method of electron - ion recombination , for @xmath151 , we employ the bs theory to compute the detailed and the averaged resonant dr cross sections ;",
    "the background contributions are computed in the hydrogenic approximation . the agreement and the continuity between the three sets of data in fig .",
    "9 shows the cc method for electron - ion recombination to be accurate and self - consistent with inverse photoionization ( photorecombination ) and electron impact excitation .",
    "another example that demonstrates the threshold behavior and continuity of dr and electron impact excitation cross sections is the recent calculation for ( e  +  c  iv ) @xmath152 c  iii ( pradhan 2001 ) . in fig .",
    "10 we delineate the fine structure @xmath153 in the energy region spanned by the fine structure @xmath154 thresholds .",
    "10(a ) shows the detailed resonances in the vicinity of the two series limits .",
    "10(b ) shows the @xmath153 averaged over the lower resonance series @xmath155 below the @xmath156 level , but still with the detailed resonance structures due to the higher series @xmath157 ( solid line ) .",
    "the @xmath153 averaged over both series is shown as the dashed line . above the @xmath156 , @xmath153 is averaged over the @xmath158 series .",
    "the sharp drop in the total @xmath153 at the @xmath156 threshold reflects the termination of dr due to the @xmath155 resonance series , and with the @xmath159 contribution still low in spite of the fact that @xmath160 96 .",
    "the large drop in the dr cross section is due to enhanced autoionization into the excited level , when the @xmath155 channel opens up at the lower fine structure threshold @xmath156 while the radiative decay remains constant .",
    "the @xmath161 contribution builds up to the second peak at @xmath162 .    in fig .",
    "10(b ) it is shown that the resonance averaged @xmath163 = 242.57 mb ( dark circle at @xmath156 ) , but the detailed @xmath153 has resonances due to the higher series @xmath164 lying at and near threshold .",
    "the resonance averaged @xmath153 at the next dr peak , @xmath165 = 441.81 mb ( dark circle at @xmath162 ) .",
    "interestingly , the fine structure in the theoretical @xmath153 in fig .",
    "10(a , b ) appears to be discernible as a small dip in experimental data in just below 8 ev ( schippers 2001 , pradhan 2001 ) .",
    "although the @xmath154 separation is only 0.013 ev , it may be possible to detect these fine structure threshold effects in future experiments with increased resolution .    at the @xmath154 thresholds the sum of the averaged fine structure @xmath166 = @xmath167 = 684.38 mb .",
    "10(c ) compares the near - threshold eie cross sections with the absolute measurements from two recent experiments , ( greenwood ( 1999 ) and janzen ( 1999 ) ) , convolved over their respective beam widths of 0.175 ev and 2.3 ev .",
    "our results are in good agreement with both sets ( and also with another recent experiment by bannister ( 1998 ) . although the present results are the first bprm calculations with relativistic fine structure for c  iv , their sum is in good agreement with previous ls coupling cc calculations of @xmath167 reported by ( burke 1992 , griffin 2000 , janzen 1999 ) .",
    "the general shape of the unified recombination rate coefficient is illustrated in examples in the previous section .",
    "basically , one finds an exponential decrease with temperature starting with the background rr part of the rate coefficient , attennuated by a large bump at higher temperatures due to dr .",
    "however , resonance series due to several ion thresholds might contribute to over extended energy ranges .",
    "nussbaumer and storey ( 1983 ) first pointed out that near - threshold low - energy resonances give rise to a low - temperature dr bump .",
    "an extension of the same concept is seen if several groups of resonances are interspersed throughout , from low to high - energies . in such cases ,",
    "we find multiple dr bumps in .",
    "11 shows ( e  +  fe  xxii ) @xmath152 fe  xxi recombination , with discernible bumps due to the @xmath168 and @xmath169 groups of resonances ( nahar 2003 ) .",
    "the r - matrix eigenfunction cc expansion for b - like fe  xxii includes 29 ls terms ( 29-cc ) up to the = 3 complex of configurations : @xmath170 . including only the = 2 terms gives an 8-cc expansion . fig .",
    "12 shows the detailed photoionization cross sections for two excited states , out of a total of 835 states of fe  xxi calculated using the 29-cc fe  xxii target expansion ( the highest 8-cc threshold is also marked ) .",
    "it is particularly noteworthy how the same resonance complexes appear quite differently in photoionization of states with different angular and spin symmetries sl@xmath171 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath172 transitions in the core ion play an important role in the determination of total in fig .  11 throughout the temperature range where fe",
    "xxi / xxi are likely to be abundant in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas , and agree well with the recently reported experimental values in the `` photoionized zone ''",
    "t @xmath173 ev ( savin 2003 , fig . 5 ) .",
    "at very low energies there are additional resonance structures which may not be of practical importance but provide a good check on theoretical works ; more detailed calculations in this region ( @xmath22 20 ev ) are in progress . however , at temperatures t @xmath174 k ( @xmath175 ev ) the present rate coefficients in fig .",
    "11 are considerably higher than those reported by savin ( 2003 ) , since their measurements do not extend to high energies relevant to collisionally ionized plasmas , particularly the multiple dr bump region described herein ; the temperature of maximum abundance of fe  xxi in collisional equilibrium is @xmath176 k ( arnaud and raymond 1992 ) .",
    "a more detailed comparison will be reported elsewhere , together with total recombination rate coefficients for fe  xxi at all temperatures of general importance ( see also section 4.6 on ionization equilibrium ) .",
    "scattering , photoionization , and recombination of all atomic systems involve an infinite number of resonances .",
    "close coupling calculations allow for resonances in an _ ab initio _ manner .",
    "broad low - lying near - threshold resonances have autoionization rates @xmath177 , much greater than typical dipole radiative decay rates @xmath178 . for most atomic systems up to the iron - peak elements ( @xmath179 = 30 ) , @xmath180 for the lowest dipole transitions .",
    "therefore , _ a priori _ , radiation damping is not expected to be a dominant effect .",
    "notable exceptions are high-@xmath179 , h - like and he - like ions with @xmath181 . for highly excited states with @xmath182 @xmath51 ,",
    "the @xmath183 decreases as @xmath184 and @xmath77 dominates .",
    "however , all resonances are susceptible to radiation damping somewhere between 0 - 100% , i.e. damping ratios ( undamped / damped ) from 1 to @xmath51 , depending on @xmath0 , @xmath59 , energy relative to threshold , and radiative transition probability @xmath77 ( radiation damping of resonance profiles was demonstrated in pradhan 1981 , and pradhan and seaton 1985 )",
    ". however , determination of damping factors of individual resonances per se may be inaccurate as they depend on the precise positions , heights , and shapes of resonances .",
    "undamped / damped ratios @xmath185 unity for a few individual resonance profiles do not imply that radiation damping is important in general .",
    "more meaningful than the damping factors for individual resonances is the combined effect of all damped resonances on the integrated rate coefficient for an atomic process , i.e. on the quantities of practical interest in laboratory and astrophysical applications .",
    "rate coefficients are usually obtained by averaging cross sections over a maxwellian .",
    "generally broad near - threshold resonances corresponding to the lowest @xmath0 and @xmath59 make the dominant contribution , relative to narrower ones with higher @xmath0 and @xmath59 .",
    "the cc calculations include all closed channels with @xmath39 and @xmath186 .",
    "other methods based on quantum defect theory , such as gailitis averaging of resonances , or the bs theory of dr , are employed for @xmath187 . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "only the h - like or the he - like core ions appear to require a detailed consideration of damping of low-(@xmath188 ) resonances .",
    "the primary application of the present cc method for ( e + ion ) recombination is to obtain unified total recombination rates for elements up to the iron - peak elements with @xmath189 30 , well within the validity of the intermediate coupling approximation using the bp method . in general , the contribution from the near - threshold region is dominated by large resonances with @xmath190 ; the extremely narrow resonances , with @xmath183 several orders of magnitude smaller , make relatively little contribution and may be neglected .",
    "the calculations generally resolve each resonance @xmath0-complex up to @xmath191 ; the higher @xmath59 resonances are assumed to be damped out , thereby making allowance for radiation damping , although it is not a large effect on the final results .",
    "it is interesting to note that experimental measurements also retain up to about @xmath191 levels before field ionization ( wolf 1991 ) . with the exception of h- and he - like ions where all resonances undergo significant radiative damping ,",
    "the cross sections and rate coefficients should not be influenced by radiation damping when the core radiative transitions do not significantly compete with autoionization .",
    "this is certainly true for all @xmath143 radiative core transitions even in highly charged ions .",
    "for example , the theoretical bprm results without radiation damping of low-@xmath0 resonances in photorecombination cross sections for ( e  +  ar  xiv ) recombintion with a boron - like core transition 2s - 2p ( zhang and pradhan 1997 ) , are in excellent agreement with the _ absolute _ cross sections measured from the heavy ion storage ring cryring in stockholm ( dewitt 1995 ) , both in magnitude and details of the extensive resonance structures and background cross section .",
    "the present unified approach incorporates the major effects of importance in the calculation of total effective recombination cross sections and rate coefficients .",
    "however , without loss of generality , some other physical effects might be of marginal interest in exceptional cases .",
    "criticism of the shortcomings of the method are confined to isolated resonances , series limits , or small energy ranges , but which otherwise affect the rate coefficients by no more than a few percent ( gorczyca 2002 ) .",
    "for example , the precise choice of n@xmath192 where the background recombination cross section becomes negligible and dr dominates for @xmath41 , is not crucial and may be varied .",
    "although some low - resonances close to n@xmath192 might be very narrow and not fully resolved , the effect is barely discernible ( zhang 2001 ) .",
    "the precise positions , shapes , and heights of resonances depend not simply on resolution , but also on the cc wavefunction expansions ( and accuracy thereof ) , relativistic fine structure , parameters chosen for @xmath193-matrix calculations , and numerical inaccuracies . resolution _ per se",
    "_ is not a major problem by comparison ( c.f .",
    "ramirez and bautista 2002 ) .",
    "the relevant radiative decay rates in neutrals , near - neutrals , and many - electron systems are far smaller than the autoionization rates of near - threshold resonances .",
    "for example , our detailed analysis for fe  xvii shows that radiation damping is altogether unimportant .",
    "finally , it might be pointed out that , as yet , no _ total _ recombination rate coefficients of high accuracy have been presented in literature that are discrepant by about more than 10% ( the best estimate of uncertainty in theory or experiments ) , due to radiation damping or other effects , with those calculated using the unified formulation .",
    "the narrow resonance structures may differ owing to resolution and accuracy of their energies , widths , heights , and shapes .",
    "the low-,@xmath59 resonances ( @xmath194 ) are usually highly resolved in the reported unified calculations and adequately treated by the perturbative method employed .",
    "extremely narrow low-,@xmath59 resonances that might remain unresolved should be damped out , or have negligible effect .",
    "while the unified method is quite general in scope , it does not incorporate external field and density effects .",
    "these might be important in practical situations , such as for dr near series limits .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "3 the field - ionization cut - off in the experiment is estimated at @xmath195 19 ( schippers 2001 ) .",
    "the theoretical results used the same approximate value for comparison ( pradhan 2001 ) .",
    "however , a suitably general treatment of plasma fields and densities for the calculation of total recombination cross sections in the present formulation is yet to be implemented .",
    "the present approach is especially suited to the calculation of ionization fractions in astrophysical sources such as h  ii regions in general : diffuse and planetary nebulae , supernova remnants , and broad line regions of active galactic nuclei .",
    "ionization balance is the prime feature of astrophysical models of these objects .",
    "the two most common assumptions for the ionization conditions in the plasma are : ( i ) photoionization equilibrium , and ( ii ) collisional or coronal equilibrium ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "the dominant ionizing process in the first case is photoionization from the radiation field in the source , and in the second case , electron impact ionization in usually optically thin plasmas ( such as the solar corona ) .",
    "both ionization processes are sought to be balanced by the inverse process of electron - ion recombination in the ambient medium characterized by a given electron temperature , usually in terms of a maxwellian distribution , and an electron density .",
    "the two sets of ionization balance equations may be written as    @xmath196    and ,    @xmath197    where @xmath198 is the total electron - ion recombination rate coefficient of the recombined ion of charge @xmath199 , @xmath200 , to state j at electron temperature t , @xmath201 is the rate coefficient for electron impact ionization , and @xmath35 is the photoionization cross section evaluated at photon frequency @xmath57 and convoluted with the isotropic radiation density j@xmath202 of the source ; n@xmath203 , @xmath204 , and @xmath205 are the densities for the free electrons , and the recombining and recombined ions respectively .",
    "implicit in these equations is the assumption that the ionization rates on the left hand side refer to the ground state of the ion .",
    "this condition is predicated on the assumption that the radiative and collisional processes proceed on faster time scales than photoionization and recombination .",
    "substantial departures from these equilibrium conditions may result at high densities where some excited states are significantly populated or in lte .",
    "the sum on the right hand side extends over the infinite number of excited states into which recombinations can take place , depending on the temperature .    unlike previous works , the present work seeks to satisfy the photoionization equilibrium condition ( eq .",
    "1 ) in a fundamentally consistent manner : the photoionization and recombination calculations are carried out _ using the same set of atomic eigenfunctions_. furthermore , as the detailed photoionization cross sections include autoionizing resonances in an _ ab initio _ manner , the electron - ion recombination rates subsume both the radiative and the dielectronic recombination processes , that have been treated separately in previous works using different methods .    in the coronal approximation ( eq .",
    "2 ) some of the previous calculations for ionization fractions are : jacobs ( 1980 , and references therein ) , shull and van steenberg ( 1982a , b ) , arnaud and rothenflug ( 1985 ) , sutherland and dopita ( 1993 ) . in general , most of the electron - ion recombination data employed in the earlier works is based on radiative recombination ( rr ) rates ( e.g. aldrovandi and pequignot 1973 ) derived from photoionization cross sections that neglect the now well established phenomenon of autoionizing resonances ( e.g. reilman and manson 1979 ) , and on dielectronic recombination ( dr ) rates derived from the burgess general formula ( burgess 1965 ) , but incorporating the important advances made in the treatment of dr by jacobs , who showed the effect of autoionization into excited states , and later by nussbaumer and storey ( 1983 ) who established the significant contribution from near - threshold autoionizing resonances resulting in a low - temperature bump ( in addition to the usual high - temperature rise in the dr rate ) .    using the present unified rate coefficients , ionization fractions for a number of elements",

    "ongoing calculations for astrophysically abundant elemetns are being reported in a continuing seris of publications in the astrophysical journal supplements ( e.g. nahar and pradhan 1997 ) .",
    "the electron - ion recombination process is unified in nature ; the non - resonant and resonant contributions are inseparable and observed or measured together",
    ". however , these are usually treated independently as radiative and dielectronic recombination ( rr and dr ) .",
    "a unified approach , based on the close - coupling approximation and the r - matrix method , has been developed and applied to the calculation of total recombination cross sections and rates for over 50 atoms and ions .",
    "the ab initio calculations employ a coupled eigenfunction expansion for detailed photoionization cross sections , with extensive delineation of resonance structures , for a large number of bound levels of the ( e+ion ) system , up to n(slj ) = @xmath206 10 .",
    "detailed balance ( milne relation ) thereupon yields photorecombination cross sections at all energies . for @xmath207 , recombination is predominantly dr and is treated using the precise theory of bell and seaton ; the non - resonant background contribution is treated hydrogenically as  top - up \" contribution .",

    "recombination spectra may be computed using level - specific reocmbination rate coefficients ; recombination - cascade matrices may be derived using transition probabilities that may also be computed with the same r - matrix cc wavefunction expansion as photoionization , recombination , and excitation .",
    "the unified method overcomes the shortcomings of simpler methods based on independent resonance approximation that ( i ) divide ( e+ion ) recombination into rr and dr , usually computed in different approximations , ( ii ) further subdivision of dr into low - energy and high - energy parts , such as @xmath124 = 0 , and @xmath124 = 1 , etc . , and ( iii ) neglect interference between non - resonant and resonant components , likely to be of importance for neutrals and other ionization stages with strong coupling effects , thereby limiting their validity to highly charged ions .",
    "the primary aim of this work is to obtain precise and complete total recombination rates for practical applications .",

    "<S> a unified scheme using the r - matrix method has been developed for electron - ion recombination subsuming heretofore separate treatments of radiative and dielectronic recombination ( rr and dr ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ab initio approach within the coupled channel approximation has several inherent advantages in addition to the natural unification of resonant and non - resonant phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> it enables a general and self - consistent treatment of photoionization and electron - ion recombination employing idential wavefunction expansion . </S>",
    "<S> detailed balance takes account of interference effects due to resonances in cross sections , calculated explicitly for a large number of recombined bound levels over extended energy regions . </S>",
    "<S> the theory of dr by bell and seaton is adapted for high-@xmath0 resonances in the region below series limits . </S>",
    "<S> the r - matrix method is employed for ( a ) partial and total photoionization and photorecombination cross sections of bound levels , and ( b ) dr and scattering cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> relativistic effects and fine structure are considered in the breit - pauli approximation . </S>",
    "<S> effects such as radiation damping may be taken into account where necessary . </S>",
    "<S> unfiied recombination cross sections are in excellent agreement with measurements on ion storage rings to about 10 - 20% . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to high accuracy , the strengths of the method are : ( i ) both total and level - specific cross sections and rate coefficients are obtained , and ( ii ) a single recombination rate coefficient for any given atom or ion is obtained over the entire temperature range of practical importance in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas , ( iii ) self - consistent results are obtained for the inverse processes of photoionization and recombination ; comprehensive datasets have been computed for over 50 atoms and ions . </S>",
    "<S> selected data are presented for iron ions .    </S>",
