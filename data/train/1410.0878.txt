    "superfluidity ( sf ) , i.e. , the emergence of frictionless flow below a critical temperature , is one of the most astonishing manifestations of quantum coherence on a macroscopic scale .",
    "it was first observed in 1938 in liquid 4-he . in bulk systems , sf is known to being closely related to bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) and a consequence of off - diagonal long range order of the density matrix.@xcite this concept , obviously , is not directly applicable to finite size systems in traps .",
    "moroever , these systems are possibly strongly inhomogeneous , as a result of boundary or confinement effects .",
    "an alternative approach to superfluidity is then to use the probability of realization of exchange cycles involving a sufficiently large number of particles .",
    "a well studied example for such mesoscopic quantum systems are parahydrogen clusters where , for a small number of particles , @xmath2 , the superfluid properties explicitly depend on the precise particle number and the symmetry,@xcite and the superfluidity is essentially uniformly distributed among the system.@xcite in addition , both solid - like order and sf do coexist,@xcite thus qualifying as a supersolid ( see e.g. @xcite ) state of matter .",
    "another interesting test case are harmonically confined two - dimensional coulomb clusters , whose behavior can be controlled by varying the confinement field strength .",
    "there it has been found that not only the global superfluid fraction , but also the spatial distribution of superfluidity crucially depends on @xmath3.@xcite in particular , for magic numbers , e.g. @xmath4 ( closed shells ) , there is a strong hexagonal symmetry at the center of the trap and the superfluid density is pushed to the boundary of the system .",
    "while the dependence of superfluidity on temperature , system size and coupling strength is well understood , the effect of the system dimensionality in finite systems has not been studied systematically . in this work",
    ", we try to ( partly ) fill this gap by studying large spherically confined coulomb clusters in @xmath1 and @xmath0 and compare results for , both , the global and spatial distribution of sf .",
    "the selected system size @xmath5 is representative and large enough to eliminate the sensitivity of the properties to the precise particle number.@xcite furthermore , our simulations cover the entire range from weak to strong coupling .    the analysis presented in this paper is primarily concerned with fundamental properties of superfluidity in strongly correlated spatially confined bosons in 2d and 3d traps .",
    "examples include finite molecular bosonic clusters,@xcite e.g.  hydrogen or helium droplets , doublons in strongly correlated solids or ultracold lattice gases @xcite as well as dipole - interacting trapped gases.@xcite in addition , there are numerous theoretical studies of the fundamental properties of the charged bose gas ( cbg ) @xcite and a variety of applications of the model to condensed matter physics .",
    "indirect excitons @xcite exhibit , despite their dipole - like interaction at long - range , a coulomb - like repulsion at high density.@xcite furthermore , the @xmath0 cbg of spatially bound electron pairs ( small bipolarons ) is discussed in the context of high @xmath6 superconductivity in cuprates.@xcite finally , applications also extend to macroscopic 3d bosonic coulomb systems in the inner regions of neutron stars ( proton pairing ) @xcite and the core of helium white dwarfs.@xcite",
    "we consider two- and three - dimensional systems of @xmath3 identical bosons in a harmonic confinement potential with frequency @xmath7 which are described by the dimensionless hamiltonian @xmath8 and oscillator units ( i.e. , characteristic length @xmath9 and energy scale @xmath10 ) are used throughout this work .",

    ", we employ a realization of the widely used worm algorithm path integral monte - carlo method.@xcite the latter delivers quasi - exact results by performing a trotter decomposition of the density operator @xmath14 and each particle is represented by a path of @xmath15 positions ( often denoted as `` beads '' or `` time slices '' ) in the imaginary time . to achieve sufficiently well converged results",
    ", we typically use @xmath16 while performing @xmath17 independent measurements .",
    "a convenient way to define superfluidity for finite sized , trapped systems is the consideration of the change of the moment of inertia due to quantum effects , also denoted as _ hess - fairbank_-effect . within the landau two - fluid model the total density @xmath18 is decomposed into a normal and a superfluid component , @xmath19 .",
    "of particular interest is the superfluid fraction @xmath20 , i.e. , the fraction of particles that do not participate in a rotation of the system .",

    "in addition , the sharp bend for large @xmath36 occurs at the same position .",

    "to investigate this topic we use a spatially resolved superfluid density estimator of kwon _",

    "this behavior can be understood by considering the normalization of the local superfluid density    @xmath67    eq .",
    "( [ nsfnorm ] ) implies that @xmath59 integrates to the quantum correction to the moment of inertia , i.e. , the missing contribution due to the particles in the superfluid phase .",
    "however , this also means that @xmath68 because , for the global sf fraction , not only the ratio of superfluid and total particle numbers but , in addition , the position of a particular particle is relevant .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ nsfnorm ] ) , particles near the center of the trap have a small contribution to the total moment of inertia and so their superfluidity only slightly influences @xmath20 . at the boundary , however , each particle has a significant contribution to @xmath22 and , thus , @xmath69 in this region crucially influences the global sf fraction . with increasing @xmath34",
    ", the interparticle repusion grows and the system extends radially ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ picture3 ] ) , so this effect becomes even more important . for a fixed @xmath20 , as it is the case in fig .",
    "[ lsfraction ] , the spatially resolved sf fraction in the outermost shell must approach the global value , with increasing coupling strength .",
    "a similar effect has recently been observed by kulchytskyy _",
    "@xcite from pimc simulation of @xmath70he in a cylindrical nanopore where the local superfluid response has been obtained , both , with the area formula , eq .  ( [ nsf ] ) , and a winding number approach @xcite for a rotation around and the flow along the pore axis , respectively . despite a very similar spatial distribution for the two estimators , there occurs a significant difference in the global sf fraction due to the different normalizations .    the comparison between the @xmath1 and the @xmath0 results in fig .",
    "[ lsfraction ] reveals that , for @xmath71 and equal @xmath34 , the local superfluid fraction in the outer region exceeds its two dimensional counterpart .",

    "( [ nsfnorm ] ) .",

    "all particles in the outermost shell have different contributions to the moment of inertia .",
    "the expected decrease of @xmath66 for the largest @xmath72 is therefore masked in fig .  [ lsfraction ] by contributions near @xmath64 from the same shell .",
    "the remaining open question is why @xmath20 is distributed inhomogeneously in the first place , in particular , why there is more superfluidity around the center of the trap than in the outer regions . in fig .",
    "[ picture3 ] , both the total ( red triangles ) and superfluid density ( blue squares ) are plotted with respect to @xmath60 for the systems from fig .  [ lsfraction ] .",
    "the top row shows density profiles for rather strong coupling , @xmath31 , for both the two- ( left ) and three - dimensional ( right ) system .",
    "in @xmath1 , the total density @xmath18 exhibits a relatively smooth decay with increasing @xmath60 until , at the boundary of the system , two shell - like oscillations appear . in @xmath0",
    ", @xmath18 stays almost constant around the center and a very pronounced shell appears at the boundary .",
    "the center and bottom rows show the same information for medium ( @xmath32 ) and weak ( @xmath33 ) coupling , respectively .",
    "one clearly sees that the shell - like features disappear for both dimensionalities when the coupling is reduced .",
    "a general feature for all couplings is that , @xmath18 always decays in 2d whereas , in 3d , it is nearly constant in the center . also the peak(s ) at the boundary are always significantly stronger in three dimensions .    the local superfluid density , on the other hand , exhibits a rather surprising behavior . for @xmath73 and strong coupling , @xmath59 equals @xmath18 , around the center of the trap , whereas it is significantly suppressed for larger @xmath60 , in particular within the outermost shell .",
    "the @xmath0 counterpart exhibits a similar behavior .",
    "the two innermost , weakly pronounced shells are nearly completely superfluid , whereas the difference between @xmath18 and @xmath59 is the largest in the outermost shell .",
    "this non - uniformity of the superfluidity can be made more transparent by comparing to the case of a constant local superfluid fraction @xmath74 which is depicted by the black curves in fig .",
    "[ picture3 ] . clearly , the true superfluidity is always above ( below ) the black curve in the center ( at the edge ) .",
    "let us discuss the origin of this spatial variation of the superfluid density .",
    "the first reason that comes to mind is the spatial variation of the local degeneracy parameter which is proportional to the local total density , @xmath75 .",
    "however , the numerical results for @xmath59 clearly deviate from this suggestion . in particular , for @xmath76 the superfluid density does not follow the local degeneracy ( total density ) . only at @xmath31 when shells are formed , @xmath59 increases around the outermost shell .",
    "however , the absolute value of the superfluid density does not reach a maximum despite the maximum of the degeneracy parameter . from this",
    "we conclude that the spatial distribution of superfluidity is not governed by the spatial variation of degeneracy but by the local strength of correlations .",
    "in fact , it is well known that spatial order leads to a reduction of superfluidity . in coulomb systems ,",
    "particles mainly experience interaction with neighbors with smaller @xmath60 , whereas most of the pair interactions with particles from the outer parts of the system cancel .",
    "this is a pure screening effect ( faraday cage effect ) , and cancellation would be complete in mean field approximation . hence , the investigated coulomb clusters clearly exhibit the strongest order around the boundary and are less correlated around the center of the trap .",
    "this is also manifest in the shell formation at the outer boundary ( red curves in fig .",
    "[ picture3 ] ) which is observed in classical coulomb clusters as well.@xcite another mechanism that suppresses superfluidity at the cluster boundary is a geometrical effect : within the outermost shell there are fewer particles available for the formation of exchange cycles due to the lack of neighbors in radial direction .    the medium and weakly coupled system in @xmath1 exhibit the same trend as for @xmath31 . in @xmath0 ,",
    "the largest deviation between @xmath18 and @xmath59 appears around the outermost shell as well , whereas the superfluid density remains nearly constant over the rest of the system .",
    "this is in contrast to @xmath1 and arises from the different behaviors of the total density @xmath77 . at the same time , the spatially resolved sf fraction ( cf .",
    "[ lsfraction ] ) exhibits similar trends in @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "in summary , we have presented ab - initio results for the superfluid properties of coulomb interacting bosons in both @xmath1 and @xmath0 harmonic traps .",
    "it was revealed that the availability of an additional dimension causes a decrease of the critical temperature of the superfluid crossover . to explain this non - trivial feature , we have analyzed the probability distribution of exchange cycles and the degeneracy parameter ( [ chi ] ) , and it was revealed that the critical superfluid fraction , @xmath53 , occurs for similar degeneracy for both dimensionalities , despite the significantly higher @xmath30 in @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , we have investigated the spatial distribution of superfluidity across the system by using a local superfluid density estimator . in both @xmath1 and @xmath0 ,",
    "the largest difference between the total and superfluid density @xmath18 and @xmath59 , occurs near the boundary of the system .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the increased order at large distances from the center of the trap .",
    "the onset of superfluidity at comparatively lower temperature in @xmath0 systems is expected to be a general feature and not specific for coulomb interaction .",
    "for the investigated particle number @xmath5 , superfluidity requires a collective response of the entire system , in particular the frequent realization of large exchange cycles in the path integral picture .",
    "the probability for the latter crucially depends on the degeneracy .",
    "the reported @xmath30-dependence of the degeneracy parameter @xmath37 is valid for other long - range interactions as well , because the coupling only enters in the average density @xmath51 which remains constant with decreasing @xmath54 .    the observed non - uniform distribution of superfluidity in the vicinity of the crossover , on the other hand , depends on several system properties .",
    "for small @xmath3 and strong coupling , the exact particle number plays an important role and , in case of strong hexagonal order at the center of the trap , the superfluidity is essentially located at the boundary.@xcite the almost complete screening of the interaction of a given particle with particles located at a larger distance from the center is a coulomb specific effect . in the case of other pair interactions ,",
    "a force from the outer regions may exist , which leads to different density profiles and spatial distributions of correlation effects.@xcite in addition , the explicit choice of the confinement potential also influences these quantities .",
