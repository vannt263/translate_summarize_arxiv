    "the study of links and knots in spatial graphs began with conway and gordon s seminal result that every embedding of @xmath1 contains a non - trivial link and every embedding of @xmath2 contains a non - trivial knot @xcite .",
    "their result sparked considerable interest in _ intrinsically linked _ and _ intrinsically knotted _",
    "graphs with the property that every embedding in @xmath3 contains a pair of linked cycles ( respectively , a knotted cycle ) .",
    "robertson , seymour and thomas @xcite gave a kuratowski - type classification of intrinsically linked graphs , showing that every such graph contains one of the graphs in the _",
    "petersen family _ as a minor ( see figure  [ f : petersen ] ) .",
    "there is , as yet , no such classification for intrinsically knotted graphs ; and since there are dozens of known minor - minimal intrinsically knotted graphs ( see @xcite ) , any such classification will be far more complex .",
    "[ htpb ] @xmath4    however , while robertson , seymour and thomas answered the question of _ which _ graphs are intrinsically linked , they did not address _ how _ they are linked , and how complicated the linking must be . in this paper , we measure the  complexity \" of a graph with respect to intrinsic linking ( respectively , intrinsic knotting ) by the minimal number of links ( respectively , knots ) in any embedding of the graph ( denoted @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) .",

    ", one could focus instead on the complexity of the individual links or knots .",

    "@xcite constructed graphs whose embeddings must contains links with many components .",
    "recently , the second author , with flapan and naimi @xcite , has generalized these results to show that there are graphs whose embedding must contain a link which is arbitrarily complex as measured by _ both _ the pairwise linking numbers _ and _ the size of the second coefficient of the conway polynomial of the components .    the notion of @xmath5",
    "was introduced by tom fleming and the second author in @xcite , where they investigated the minimum number of links in complete partite graphs on 7 or 8 vertices .",
    "we extend this investigation to complete partite graphs on 9 vertices , and also for several general families of complete partite graphs .",
    "we also investigate the minimum number of knots in complete partite graphs on 8 vertices .",
    "the only previous results in this area are bounds given by hirano @xcite ( improving on results of blain et .",
    "@xcite ) for the minimal number of knotted hamiltonian cycles in @xmath8 .    in general",
    ", finding the minimum number of links or knots in a graph requires determining both a lower bound and and upper bound , and then working to bring these bounds together .",
    "upper bounds are established by examining particular embeddings and counting the number of links ( or knots ) in the embedding . while simple in theory , this is very difficult in practice  even relatively simple graphs can have hundreds or thousands of cycles which need to be checked ; and each time the embedding is changed in hopes of reducing the number of links or knots , the computation must be repeated .",
    "clearly , this is the type of task which is best done by a computer , and much of our effort has been to develop a program to do these computations .",
    "the program , _ plotter _",
    ", is freely available from the authors @xcite .",
    "it incorporates a graphical user interface which allows the user to draw the embedding directly , and the program will then find all pairs of linked cycles with nontrivial linking number and all knotted cycles where the second coefficient of the conway polynomial is non - zero . for our purposes , these invariants were largely sufficient .",
    "the algorithms for calculating the invariants are based on lowell trott s _ gordian _ program @xcite .",
    "lower bounds are generally determined by looking for subgraphs for which the minimum number of links ( or knots ) is known .",
    "of course , a given link ( or knot ) may appear in several different subgraphs , so the combinatorial analysis can become quite complex . in this paper ,",
    "the most extreme example is the proof that the minimum number of links for @xmath0 is 74 .    in section [ s : prelim ] , we provide basic definitions and notation , and recall some useful results from @xcite . in section [ s : general ] , we determine the minimum number of links in complete partite graphs with all but four vertices in one partition ( in the case of @xmath9 we find upper and lower bounds ) ; these results are summarized in table [ ta : general ] .",

    "foisy s proof does not provide much information as to the length of the knotted cycle .",

    "motwani , raghunathan and saran @xcite also showed that @xmath64-y moves preserve intrinsic knottedness , where a @xmath64-y move removes the edges of a 3-cycle , and adds a new vertex adjacent to the vertices of the original 3-cycle , as shown in figure [ f : triangley ] .    [ htpb ] @xmath65    in particular , the result of performing a @xmath64-y move on @xmath2 is the 8-vertex graph @xmath66 , shown in figure [ f : h8 ] .",

    "if @xmath75 does contain one of these three edges , say @xmath76 , then there is a corresponding knotted 8-cycle in @xmath72 obtained by replacing @xmath76 with @xmath79 and @xmath80 . if @xmath75 contains two of the three edges , say @xmath76 and @xmath78 , then @xmath75 is isotopic to the embedded cycle obtained by replacing these two edges with @xmath79 and @xmath81 ( since the triangle @xmath82 in @xmath73 is null - homotopic in the complement of the graph ) . in this case , we obtain a knotted 7-cycle which contains @xmath68 , but does not contain one of the vertices adjacent to @xmath68 , and so again contains all the bottom vertices .",
