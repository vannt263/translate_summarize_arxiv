    "recently the interest in magnetically induced qcd effects has grown , as a magnetic field offers a controllable parameter that gives rise to new unexpected results that might lead to novel insights in qcd , e.g.  the chiral magnetic effect , which is related to cp - violating processes @xcite , chiral magnetic spiral / wave , a split between the deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration temperature , etc . since at the lhc",
    "very strong magnetic fields ( of the order of @xmath5 tesla ) are expected to arise in heavy ion collisions @xcite , this creates the perfect setting for experimental searches for possible interesting qcd effects in a strong magnetic field .",

    "a phenomenological approach was adopted to argue the existence of a @xmath0 meson condensate , respectively using an effective quantum electrodynamics lagrangian for the @xmath0 mesons and a njl - model .",
    "lattice evidence in favour of this effect appeared in @xcite .",
    "a consequence of such a condensation would be that the qcd vacuum at zero temperature becomes superconducting at sufficiently large magnetic field , forming a quite exotic phase .",
    "in addition , it should be a kind of anisotropic superconductor , see @xcite for more details on this .",

    "some preliminary and incomplete results were already presented in @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the condensation itself and ensuing conductivity properties of the vacuum will be relegated to future work . here",
    "we intend to take the first step in this program , and show that a condensation should occur as we encounter a tachyonic instability in the @xmath0 meson sector .",

    "holographic qcd - models give a description of hadronic physics through a dual supergravity theory in a higher - dimensional world .",
    "this working philosophy is based on the original maldacena conjecture @xcite .",
    "the duality is valid for a large number of colours and at large t hooft coupling @xmath8 where qcd itself is unmanageable , thus providing an analytical setting for studying non - perturbative qcd effects .",
    "the sakai - sugimoto model in particular @xcite uses a d4/d8/@xmath9 brane setup which manages to reproduce much of the low - energy physics of quenched qcd in the chiral limit , such as confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking at low temperature , vector meson dominance , pion effective action , etc .",
    "a short review of the model is presented in section [ asect ] .",
    "we will discuss the effect of the magnetic field on the @xmath0 meson mass in both the original antipodal embedding considered by sakai and sugimoto ( where the flavour branes merge at a value @xmath10 of the holographic radius equal to the cut - off of space @xmath11 ) and the more general non - antipodal embedding ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the latter enables us to take into account constituents of the @xmath0 meson , at least to some level .",

    "we have fixed the free remaining parameters in the holographic model by matching them to phenomenological or experimental values for the constituent quark mass , the pion decay constant and the @xmath0 meson mass @xmath14 , in absence of a magnetic field .",

    "we summarize how to introduce a background magnetic field @xmath1 into the model .",
    "only in the @xmath12 case there is an effect of @xmath1 on the embedding . considering two flavours , we allow for the possibility that the up- and down - flavour branes respond to the magnetic field in a different way , which they turn out to do .",

    "+ in section [ previous ] , we derive the mass equation for the @xmath0 meson , recovering the landau levels of @xcite that indicate the instability of the vacuum , as the effective masses of the charged @xmath0 mesons polarizations that are transverse w.r.t .",
    "the applied magnetic field become imaginary in the lowest landau level when the magnetic field reaches the critical value @xmath20 .",
    "an obvious drawback of the phenomenological model used in @xcite is the fact that the @xmath0 mesons are regarded as point particles without internal structure .",
    "the magnetic field is so strong that it is not evident to trust that the underlying quark structure will be of no importance to the story .",
    "using a njl model allows to consider internal quark dynamics @xcite but the ensuing @xmath0 meson dynamics is then perhaps somewhat less phenomenologically valid than that of @xcite .",
    "+ in section [ landaunonantipodal ] we take one effect of the constituents of the @xmath0 meson into account through the effect of chiral magnetic catalysis , which tells us that the constituent quarks get heavier in the presence of a background magnetic field , as will the @xmath0 meson itself ( apart from the landau shift lowering the effective mass ) .",
    "the resulting effective @xmath0 meson action resembles that of @xcite but with an effective @xmath1-dependent mass due to internal quark effects .",
    "this leads to a slightly larger value for the critical magnetic field , @xmath21 , at the onset of the predicted condensation .",
    "this increase is in qualitative agreement with the lattice data of @xcite . in section [ cspion ]",
    "we discuss that pions , in a leading approximation in the inverse t hooft coupling , should not disturb the charged @xmath0 meson condensation , as the magnetic field induces a coupling only between the pions and non - transverse , w.r.t .  the magnetic field , @xmath0 meson polarizations .",
    "we summarize in section [ conc ] and point out how to improve our analysis in future work . in the appendix , we have collected some technical details .",

    "<S> we study the @xmath0 meson in a uniform magnetic field @xmath1 using a holographic qcd - model , more specifically a @xmath2 brane setup in the confinement phase at zero temperature with two quenched flavours . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of the model are fixed by matching to corresponding dual field theory parameters at zero magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the up- and down - flavour branes respond differently to the presence of the magnetic field in the dual qcd - like theory , as expected because of the different electromagnetic charge carried by up- and down - quark . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how to recover the landau levels , indicating an instability of the qcd vacuum at @xmath3 towards a phase where charged @xmath0 mesons are condensed , as predicted by chernodub using effective qcd - models . </S>",
    "<S> we improve on these existing effective qcd - model analyses by also taking into account the chiral magnetic catalysis effect , which tells us that the constituent quark masses rise with @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this turns out to increase the value of the critical magnetic field for the onset of @xmath0 meson condensation to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss the influence of pions , which turn out to be irrelevant for the condensation in the approximation made . </S>"
