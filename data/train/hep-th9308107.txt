    "the classical `` no hair '' theorems state that a stationary black hole is characterized by a very limited set of parameters , essentially its mass , angular momentum and charges corresponding to massless gauge fields .",
    "this means that an external observer can get very little information about the matter configuration that formed the black hole .",
    "this situation is directly connected to the thermal nature of the hawking radiation and if the black hole evaporates completely this leads to a violent contradiction with the unitary evolution of a system , according to quantum theory .",
    "one way out would be to find additional degrees of freedom of a black hole that are observable only by quantum effects ",
    "`` quantum hair '' .",
    "coleman , preskill and wilczek ( cpw ) @xcite proposed recently a model in which such a quantum hair seems to exist . using semiclassical thermodynamics , neglecting the black - hole evaporation through the hawking radiation , they calculated the effects of such a hair that can be measured by an external observer .",
    "the effect found is very small  non - perturbative in @xmath0  and therefore a natural question that arises is whether it is reasonable to assume that this effect is not influenced by the hawking radiation ( which is of first order in @xmath0 ) .",
    "our analysis indicates that it is not .",
    "indeed we show that the characteristic time of the effect is much longer than the whole ( semiclassical ) life time of the black hole and for such a long time the thermodynamic equilibrium hypothesis is certainly not justified .",
    "this means that the results indicating the existence of the quantum hair are not reliable .",
    "furthermore , an analysis of an analogous toy model suggests that the instability of the black hole  which causes the energy levels to have finite width ",
    "`` hides '' the potential hair .",
    "we start , in section 2 by reviewing cpw s model , in section 3 we show its inconsistency and in section 4 we analyze a toy model which demonstrates what we expect really happens .",
    "we conclude by discussing the general question of the existence of a quantum hair in view of the above results .",
    "in this section we will review briefly the construction of the hair proposed by cpw @xcite .",
    "the proposed model is an abelian higgs model coupled to gravity , where the charge of the scalar field @xmath1 that `` condenses '' ( acquires a non - trivial vacuum expectation value @xmath2 ) is a multiple of the elementary charge quantum : @xmath3 .",
    "the action is ( c=1 ) s = s_grav+s_em+s_higgs+s_mat where s_grav=- ( @xmath4 is the boundary metric and @xmath5 is the extrinsic curvature on the boundary , both induced by @xmath6 ) s_em = d^4xf_f^ f_=_a_-_a _",
    "s_higgs = d^4 x and @xmath7 is the action of a matter field @xmath8 of charge @xmath9 that does not condensate .",
    "consequently , although the @xmath10 symmetry is spontaneously broken , there is a residual symmetry which is respected by the vacuum : = e^i2_nu(1 ) under which @xmath11 and @xmath1 and @xmath12 are invariant .",
    "the existence of a @xmath13 ( primary ) hair would mean that the black - hole states are labeled by a @xmath13 charge which can be measured by an external observer .",
    "cpw propose to identify the charge dependence through the canonical partition function in the black - hole sector .",
    "the partition function for a gauge theory can be expressed by a euclidean path integral @xcite : z()(e^-h)= _ a__ie^-s_e/ where @xmath14 represent the fields of the model , @xmath15 is the euclidean action and the integration @xmath16 is over the configurations which are periodic in the euclidean time @xmath17 with period @xmath18 and satisfy a_(,)0 || .",
    "as suggested by gibbons and hawking @xcite , to treat gravitation quantum mechanically , one integrates over ( euclidean ) geometries as well . for the black - hole sector",
    "the geometries are restricted to a @xmath19 topology .",
    "since the charge @xmath20 commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath21 , it is meaningful to consider the partition function @xmath22 , restricted to states of a given charge @xmath20 . for @xmath10 gauge group",
    "these are , by definition , states @xmath23 which satisfy u()|q>=e^iq / e|q > where @xmath24 is a gauge transformation with the asymptotic form ( ) e^i= ||and @xmath25 is the unitary representation of the gauge group in the space of states .",
    "inserting the appropriate projection operator @xmath26 into the trace one obtains z(,q)(_q e^-h)= _",
    "-^ e^-i ( , ) where ( , ) = _ , g _ a__ie^-s_e/ and the integration @xmath27 is over the configurations which are periodic in @xmath17 with period @xmath18 and satisfy _",
    "0^ea_d || .",
    "the functional integral in @xmath28 is calculated semiclassically therefore only configurations with finite action contribute .",
    "this means that the geometry must be asymptotically flat . in the higgs model",
    "this also means @xmath29 and @xmath30 which implies = 2k(@xmath31 is called `` vorticity '' ) , so the expression for the partition function is , finally z(,q)=_k=-^ e^-i2(,k ) ( , k)=_,ke^-s_e/ and using standard thermodynamics one obtains a q - dependent correction to the relation between the mass of the black - hole and its temperature : m(,q)-m(,q=0)=- .",
    "the same method provides expectation values for local observables such as the components of the electric field @xmath32 , in a given q - sector : _ , q= _ k=-^e^-i2 _ , kif_je^-s_e/ and a non trivial q - dependence provides ( at least conceptually ) a method to measure the @xmath13-charge .    in the semiclassical limit @xmath33 , the functional integral",
    "is dominated by the configuration which minimizes the euclidean action and therefore is a solution of the classical ( euclidean ) equations of motion  an instanton : ( , k)~e^-s_clas/. there is an instanton solution for each vorticity @xmath31 .",
    "the corresponding action @xmath34 is even in @xmath31 and increases with @xmath35 , therefore the leading @xmath20-dependence is obtained by retaining only @xmath36 .",
    "the result is 1 - 2 with ce^-s/ where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is a ratio of functional determinants ( which can be shown to be positive and @xmath39 in the limit @xmath33 , @xmath40const . ) .",
    "this leads ( neglecting terms suppressed by additional powers of @xmath0 ) to : [ dm ] m(,q)-m(,q=0)- ce^-s/. the final step is the calculation of @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 is the action of the ( euclidean ) schwarzschild black - hole , which is ( after substructing the ( infinite ) flat action ) s_0= for @xmath44 one seeks a rotationally invariant solution that obeys the boundary conditions at spatial infinity @xmath45 .",
    "the corresponding action is evaluated for two limiting values of the compton wavelength of the massive vector meson , called `` string thickness '' :    * the thick string limit @xmath46 : + ( where @xmath47 is the radius of the horizon ) + in this limit the action can be expanded in the small parameter and the leading term is obtained by setting @xmath48 which corresponds to the unbroken @xmath10 gauge theory . consequently the solution is the euclidean reissner - nordstrm black - hole , so @xmath42 is given by [ dlsthick ] s. * the thin string limit @xmath49 : + in this limit it is argued that the solution in the @xmath50 plane looks just like a cross section of a cosmic string at the origin @xmath51 ( recall that @xmath17 here is an angular coordinate ) and using an effective action one obtains s()^2t_st(1 - 4gt_sr)^-1 where @xmath52 is the string tension .",
    "small back reaction corresponds to @xmath53 and in this limit it can be shown that @xmath52 has the form t_stv^2f(/e^2 ) where @xmath54 is a slowly varying function such that @xmath55 therefore for small back reaction one has [ dlsthin ] sv^2f(/e^2 ) .",
    "to summarize , by calculating the canonical partition function in different @xmath20-sectors , one discovers observable quantities ( mass , electric field ) which depend on the @xmath13 charge @xmath20 of the black - hole and consequently enable a measurement of this charge .",
    "in the process of getting the results of the previous section , a few simplifying assumptions were made  an inevitable step in the current state of knowledge of quantum gravity . a necessary condition ( though not sufficient ) for the validity of the results is that they be consistent with the assumptions .",
    "the assumption that underlies the whole method ( as stated by the authors themselves ) is that to calculate the effects of the @xmath13 charge , one can neglect the hawking radiation .",
    "indeed , the use of a canonical partition function applies to a stationary system in thermal equilibrium with a heat reservoir ( in our case this translates to a black - hole in equilibrium with a surrounding radiation bath ) .",
    "it is not clear if the very existence of such a system is allowed by the laws of physics ( since it does not satisfy einstein s equations ) .",
    "so in writing down the canonical partition function , one actually refers to an evaporating black - hole with the hope that it can be considered in an _ approximate _ equilibrium ( a notion that seems to make sense semiclassically since the evaporation process is a quantum effect  of order @xmath0 ) .",
    "apostriori , the problem with this assumption is that the effect that was discovered is non - perturbative in @xmath0 and therefore much weaker then the neglected hawking radiation .",
    "let us illustrate this .",
    "we are concerned with the limit @xmath33 , @xmath40const . ,",
    "in which @xmath56 is very large , and therefore z(,q ) where @xmath23 is the lowest - energy state with charge @xmath20 .",
    "we define the `` topological vacua ''    @xmath57 and @xmath58 are defined modulu @xmath59 . )",
    "this means that @xmath60 is the transition amplitude between topological vacua with @xmath61 , during the time period @xmath62 : ( = t , ) = < n+|e^-th|n > ( and the leading contribution @xmath63 is the one with the smallest @xmath35 ) was interpreted in @xcite as a process of nucleation and annihilation of a virtual cosmic string which envelopes the black - hole , however this interpretation is not required for our results . ] .",
    "this is the exact situation as in gauge field theories ( or for a particle in a one dimensional periodic potential ) .",
    "the existence of euclidean configurations labeled by a `` topological charge '' ( in the present case it is the vorticity @xmath31 ) which contribute to the vacuum transition amplitude , implies the existence of a set of states , called `` topological vacua '' between which the euclidean configurations interpolate .",
    "( this follows from the usual interpretation of euclidean configurations as contributions to tunneling amplitudes . )",
    "the statement that the states @xmath64 are non degenerate is equivalent to the statement that the topological vacua are not stationary states , or in other words , the transition amplitudes between different vacua do not vanish .",
    "in the context of a semiclassical calculation such a statement can be checked only for times which are not longer then the semiclassical life - time of a black - hole ) @xmath65 ] which is [ t ] t^3 .",
    "let us calculate the transition amplitude : @xmath66 using eq .",
    "( [ dm ] ) we have m(q)_q = qe m_0 + 2m(2 ) where 2m = ce^-s/ therefore @xmath67^l   \\nonumber \\\\   & = & ne^{-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}tm_0}\\sum_{l_+,l_-}\\frac{1}{l_+!l_- ! }     \\left(-\\frac{i}{\\hbar}t\\dl m\\right)^{l_++l_-}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum is over all non - negative integers @xmath68 which satisfy l_+-l_-=nn . without loss of generality ,",
    "we choose @xmath69 so for @xmath70 we have the leading term is twice bigger but this does not spoil our argument ]",
    "|_n(t)|=| |^|n|(1 + ( ) ) 1",
    ". finally we evaluate @xmath71 taking @xmath42 from eqs.([dlsthick ]  [ dlsthin ] ) and @xmath62 from ( [ t ] ) :    * for the thick string || c()^2 e^-s/ with where ( ne)^2 is the dimensionless gauge field coupling constant ( analogous to the fine structure constant in electromagnetism ) . * for the thin string ( neglecting back reaction ) ||c ( ) ^2 e^-s/ with v^2 f ( ) ( the inequality follows from @xmath72 ) .    both expressions vanish exponentially with @xmath73 and since @xmath74 must be small , it follows that indeed @xmath75 is negligibly small .    to summarize ,",
    "we have shown that the semiclassical approximation does not give any reliable indication for the instability of the topological vacua ",
    "the transition between such states during the semiclassical life of the black - hole is extremely improbable .",
    "this means that there is no indication for the non - degeneracy of the @xmath23 states  no @xmath76-hair .",
    "this , of course , does not prove that the quantum hair does not exist and to discover what really happens , one must go beyond the semiclassical approximation . since we do not know how to do that , it would be useful to get intuition about what can be expected , by analyzing a simpler model which shares with the real problem the relevant properties .",
    "we will analyze such a toy model in the next section , concluding that the @xmath76 hair is indeed expected to be illusory .",
    "we will consider a particle in a one dimensional space , subjected to a potential as described in figure [ pot ] .",
    "there are three high potential - barriers ( labeled @xmath77 ) which divide the space into four regions ( labeled @xmath78 ) .",
    "the two central regions represent the black - hole sector and the barrier between them is what causes the splitting of the spectrum of this sector  the analogue of the quantum hair .",
    "the outer regions represent the `` vacuum '' into which the black - hole evaporates and the hawking radiation is modeled by the penetration through the side barriers .",
    "this is of course a very crude model and it is only meant to demonstrate how the instability of the internal states influences the ability to measure the splitting .",
    "the details of the analysis are given in the appendix and here we only summarize the results .    the stationary state of energy @xmath79 can be written in each region , in the wkb approximation ( assumed to be valid there , except near the sides ) , in the form :    * between the barriers ( @xmath80 ) : _ l= * `` under '' the barriers ( @xmath81 ) : _ l = e^-i * where @xmath82 .",
    "the relations between the parameters in adjacent regions are given by the `` connection formula '' for each `` turning point '' ( @xmath83)-coefficients are meant to make these relations as simple as possible ( see the appendix ) . ] .",
    "all the characteristics of the system can be described by the following parameters ( functions of the energy @xmath79 ) :    a barrier is represented by the `` penetrability '' = e^-kdx    and an allowed region ( between barriers ) is represented by the `` total phase '' = kdx    ( where the integration is over the relevant region ) ] the first restriction is unimportant since anyway we are interested only in barriers very high above the energy level .",
    "but the second restriction means that the analysis is invalid for the lowest levels .",
    "this restriction does not appear in the alternative model in which the turning points are replaced by vertical walls . at first",
    "look the results relevant to our purposes seem to be identical in both models . ] .",
    "we will compare probabilities corresponding to different wave - functions ( see below ) and for this they have to be normalized .",
    "therefore we will perform the quantization in a box , very large compared to any relevant length parameter in the problem .    for @xmath84 ( infinite barriers )",
    "there are four disconnected regions and each region has its own states .",
    "the inner ( `` black - hole '' ) energy spectrum is determined by the quantization conditions _ 1=0 .",
    "we will be interested in a degenerate level , we will consider a neighborhood of an energy @xmath85 which is in the spectrum of both left and right inner regions : @xmath86 for this level we will check when it is possible to recognize a splitting caused by finiteness of the central barrier ( @xmath87 ) .      in analogy to the @xmath76 symmetry of the black - hole we first assume a @xmath88 symmetry of the potential : [ sym0 ] v(-x)=v(x ) .",
    "consequently , the solutions are either symmetric or antisymmetric . defining _ 1b_1^+/b_1",
    "^ - it can be shown that a symmetric solution corresponds to @xmath89 and an antisymmetric one corresponds to @xmath90 therefore @xmath91 should be identified as the @xmath88-charge of a state .    we want to explore the conditions in which the charge and the energy of the black - hole states are correlated in an observable way so that the charge would be a genuine ( measurable ) quantum hair . in the limit @xmath92 , which corresponds to a completely stable black - hole",
    ", the correlation is clear .",
    "the black - hole sector is isolated and every degenerate level splits to two levels dee - e^0= where d= is the ( local ) density of states",
    ". this splitting corresponds to d_1_1-_1 ^ 0=_0=-_1 and this means that we have a separation between states of different charge .",
    "note also that the separation is proportional to the `` penetrability '' @xmath93 of the barrier .",
    "when the side barriers are finite ( the black hole is not stable ) , the states are not restricted to a single region .",
    "in particular , there are no exclusively - black - hole states ( each state has `` tails '' in the outer regions ) so we must investigate the whole spectrum of states .",
    "this is a very dense spectrum ( tends to the continuum in the infinite box limit ) and both charges are equally distributed in it , so correlations can emerge only from differences in the probabilities to find ( in the black - hole region ) states of different charges in different regions of energy . in the appendix",
    "we calculate the probability @xmath94 to find the particle in the right black - hole region as a function of charge ( represented by @xmath95 ) and energy ( represented by @xmath96 ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ p1sym ] :    for each charge     1 .",
    "the maximal @xmath97 is obtained at d_1=-_1=_0 ; 2 .",
    "the `` width '' @xmath98 at half height is _",
    "1_2 ^ 2 ;    so each level in the @xmath99 limit is replaced by a band of levels with width @xmath100 .",
    "this is actually a recovery of a very well - known phenomenon  the width of a resonance .",
    "now the situation should be clear . when the instability @xmath100 of the black hole is small compared to the penetrability @xmath93 through the central barrier we have a sharp separation between the two bands of opposite charge and the charge is therefore measurable ( this is the situation , in particular , for @xmath101 ) .",
    "as the instability increases , the bands get wider and when @xmath102 they overlap completely and there is no practical way to determine the charge knowing the energy : the instability of the internal states cancels the splitting , as anticipated .      strictly speaking ,",
    "the symmetric potential is the suitable model for the real situation , so it should be explained why it is interesting to consider a more general case .",
    "one motivation is to see if the results change by a small perturbation ( in the case of an approximate symmetry ) .",
    "also , since this model is very naive , it will be reassuring to realize that the desired effect is more general and exists also when the degeneracy is accidental we indeed expect it to be universal because the phenomenon of a width of a resonance is commonly seen as a consequence of the uncertainty principle @xmath103    as in the symmetric case , our task is to identify , in the neighborhood of a degenerate energy , two bands of states and to determine their width and the distance between them .",
    "one might expect that the qualitative situation is the same as in the symmetric case ( especially when there is an approximate symmetry ) , namely that there are two ( approximate ) values of @xmath104 and to each of them corresponds a band in a different location .",
    "this expectation was found to be wrong , but the conclusions nevertheless remains unchanged . as shown in the appendix , assuming a small instability @xmath105 , the quantization condition leads this time to pairs of states , one with @xmath106 and the other with @xmath107 . as illustrated in figure ( [ p1gen ] )    for each of these cases , @xmath94 is an even function of @xmath108 with two local maxima around @xmath109 , where _ 0 ^ 2.|_e^0 ( @xmath110 can be recognized as the ratio of the ( local ) densities of states in the two black - hole regions ) .",
    "the only difference between these cases is the width of the minima but in both cases it is proportional to the instability @xmath105 of the black hole .",
    "now we see that the results of the symmetric case are in fact general : a degenerate level splits into two bands which are well separated for a relatively stable black hole @xmath111 .",
    "the width is proportional to the instability @xmath112 so as @xmath112 increases the band gets wider and for @xmath113 one should expect that there will be no trace of the splitting .    finally , to see in what way the thermodynamical analysis of the black hole fails ,",
    "let us apply the same method to this quantum mechanical model .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we assume @xmath114 and the minimum is reached only once in each region ( at @xmath115 respectively ) .",
    "the path - integral expression for the partition function is z()=_e^s_e/ where the integration is over paths @xmath116 periodic in the euclidean time @xmath17 with period @xmath18 . in the semiclassical limit",
    "@xmath33 the integral is dominated by classical paths of a particle in an inversed potential @xmath117 ( see figure [ invpot ] )    and in the limit @xmath118 only paths between minima contribute .",
    "these limits correspond to @xmath119 ( low temperature ) which means that only the lowest - energy states contribute to the partition function .    when the barriers are infinite ( @xmath120 ) , the only finite action paths are constant paths and these give the degenerate ground - state energy at the two black - hole regions .",
    "when @xmath93 is finite there are additional paths going between the minima @xmath121 and @xmath122 and their contribution is what removes the degeneracy .",
    "these are the instantons , analogous to those used in the cpw model .",
    "but when @xmath123 are also finite , there are still additional paths going to and from the vacuum areas .",
    "as we saw , these paths change the spectrum significantly ( unless @xmath123 are sufficiently small ) .",
    "this suggests that to correct the calculation of the black hole energy spectrum , one should include configurations analogous to this last type of paths",
    ". these might be configurations that interpolate between ( euclidean ) black holes of different mass ( since we know that these are connected through the process of hawking radiation ) .",
    "in this work we have shown that the quantum hair suggested by cpw is most probably illusory .",
    "essentially , this follows directly from the fact that the effect was much smaller than the hawking radiation therefore the same arguments should apply to a larger class of would - be quantum hair , in particular those that correspond to non - perturbative effects , as the one analyzed here .",
    "this puts the search for quantum hair in a rather delicate situation . on the one hand",
    ", the classical theory implies that these hair must be weak  vanishing in the @xmath33 limit . on the other hand",
    ", the instability of the black hole implies that they can not be too weak otherwise they will be shadowed by the evaporation process .",
    "another aspect of this problem ( not unrelated ) is the fact that so far we only know how to make semiclassical calculations and these are considered reliable only for large black holes ( small curvature ) and weak effects  typically too weak in view of the above arguments .",
    "all this leads to a conclusion that there is little hope to find genuine quantum hair using semiclassical methods .",
    "perhaps these arguments can be made more precise to form a quantum extension of the classical `` no hair '' theorems .    beyond the semiclassical approximation",
    "the situation may be quite different .",
    "in particular , it is possible that the black hole does not evaporate completely and instead stabilizes as a planck - scale remnant @xcite .",
    "our arguments do not apply to this case and such a remnant might have arbitrarily weak quantum hair .",
    "thus until we understand planck - scale physics , quantum hair can not be excluded .",
    "this however should not make a difference for large black holes which seem to be bald also quantum - mechanically .",
    "in this appendix we derive the results of section [ model ] .",
    "the quantization in a box implies  by conservation of probability  that the probability current vanishes and this implies ( with the notation defined in section [ model ] ) : |a_l^+|=|a_l^-| and [ def - al ] _",
    "lthe first of these relations means that @xmath124 is a suitable measure for the probability density .",
