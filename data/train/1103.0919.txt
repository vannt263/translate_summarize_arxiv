    "dynamical transitions are a common feature of driven open quantum systems .",
    "probably the best known example is the laser whose behavior close to threshold has many features in common with a thermodynamic system close to a continuous phase transition @xcite .",
    "another text - book example which has an especially rich dynamical phase behavior is the micromaser @xcite where a flux of atoms pass one at a time through a microwave cavity . as the flux of atoms",
    "is increased the cavity undergoes a continuous dynamical crossover , followed by a series of first - order like crossovers .",
    "these crossovers are in practice rounded transitions that only become formally analogous to phase transitions in the limit where the number of atoms sent through the cavity during its lifetime becomes infinitely large @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the micromaser has been investigated very successfully in experiment by measuring the state of the atoms emerging from the cavity @xcite , an approach which gives access to quantum trajectories of the system @xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate the connection between the dynamical transitions in the micromaser and thermodynamic phase transitions in a new way by analysing the statistical properties of quantum trajectories of the cavity field .",
    "we build on a recent letter @xcite where two of us introduced a thermodynamic formalism for the study of quantum jump trajectories @xcite of open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "this formalism @xcite , based on the large - deviation ( ld ) method @xcite , treats statistical ensembles of dynamical trajectories in a manner equivalent to the way in which equilibrium statistical mechanics treats ensembles of configurations .",
    "this method allows the statistics of dynamical events to be understood using the conceptual framework of thermodynamics @xcite . in the classical context , this `` statistical mechanics of trajectories '' approach has proved useful in uncovering _ space - time _ phase transitions ( i.e. transitions in the space of temporal trajectories ) in the dynamics of slowly relaxing systems such as glasses @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we discussed how similar space - time transitions can be present in dissipative quantum systems , and showed as an example one such transition in the micromaser . here we go beyond this result by providing a comprehensive study of the dynamical phase structure of the micromaser using the ld approach .    .",

    "this quantity is a _ dynamical order parameter _ , as it allows distinct dynamical phases to be classified and distinguished between .",
    "the figure shows the dependence of @xmath4 on two parameters , the reduced atom pump rate @xmath0 ( defined below ) and the non - equilibrium `` counting '' field @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "whilst @xmath0 can be varied directly in an experiment , the behavior at different values of the parameter @xmath1 describes the statistics of quantum jumps whose probability is biased by the value of @xmath1 so that they become more ( @xmath5 ) or less ( @xmath6 ) likely to occur .",
    "the behavior at @xmath7 describes the statistics of the trajectories which would be observed in an experiment .",
    "remarkably , we find that at certain values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 the order parameter changes in a way which appears to be _ singular _ , even though in this case only 100 atoms go through the cavity in its lifetime .",

    "ii we review the standard theoretical description of the micromaser and describe the quantum trajectories generated by measuring the state of the emerging atoms .",

    "the micromaser consists of a microwave cavity which is pumped by a sequence of two level atoms which are sent into the cavity at a constant ( pump ) rate ; the cavity is also coupled to a thermal bath @xcite . in the simplest case , which we will consider here , the atoms are all prepared in the excited state and pass through the cavity one at a time .",

    "is increased from zero , the average number of cavity quanta , @xmath26 , displays a series of local maxima ( minima ) corresponding to situations where the coupling between atom and cavity is such that the atom approximately performs a half ( complete ) rabi cycle when traversing the cavity .",
    "as the effective rabi frequency depends on the occupation of the cavity , the sharpness of this effect is smoothed out .",
    "the regions of sudden increase in @xmath27 that occur around @xmath28 and @xmath29 correspond to dynamical crossovers in the cavity state and are marked by sharp peaks in the corresponding fano factor ( defined as @xmath30 ) .",

    "the proximity of the first - order transition lines to @xmath7 at higher values of @xmath0 will also have observable consequences in terms of dynamical fluctuations ( think for example of the prominence of vapor bubbles in a liquid at conditions near liquid - vapor coexistence ) .    even though it is just the unbiased trajectories that can be measured in an experiment , our predictions about the presence of singular behavior at non - zero @xmath1",
    "could still be tested quite easily as the statistics for all the biased trajectories can be generated when those for the unbiased case are known .",
    "however , a detailed comparison with experimental data would require us to extend our model to include the imperfections that typically occur in real measurements of the atomic state .",
    "it may also require the issue of finite - time corrections to be considered .    in this paper",
    "we have restricted ourselves to studying the simplest model of a micromaser and to examining only the most basic statistical properties of the trajectories .",
    "it will be interesting to examine more complex models where quantum coherences play an important role and the dynamics is not necessarily markovian , as well as examining the dependence on @xmath1 of higher cumulants of the counting distribution .",
    "we expect that the real utility of the method will be in analyzing more complex systems where a full understanding of the steady - state density matrix is not easily obtained .",
