    "in recent years an increasing number of globular clusters ( gcs ) have been found to be seriously depleted in low - mass stars ( @xmath1m@xmath2 ) when compared with high - concentration clusters ( @xcite hereafter ; @xcite ) .",
    "the first heavily depleted cluster to be discovered was ngc6712 @xcite , followed by pal5 @xcite , ngc6218 ( @xcite , hereafter ) , ngc2298 @xcite and ngc6838 @xcite . in all cases",
    ", the analysis of the radial variation of the directly observed mass function ( mf ) confirms that the relative depletion of low - mass stars is not due to the local effect of mass segregation but is a structural property of the global mass function ( gmf ) , i.e. the mf of the entire stellar population of the gc obtained by model fitting .",
    "hereafter , the gmf is defined as a power - law function , where the number of stars @xmath3 per unit mass @xmath4 follows a relationship of the type @xmath5 for @xmath6m@xmath2 .    for some of the clusters ( ngc6712 , pal5 , ngc6838 )",
    ", this finding is at least qualitatively consistent with the predicted effect of tidal stripping caused by the galaxy as these objects have typically shorter disruption times ( @xmath7 ) than the average gc according to the models of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "quantitatively , however , the agreement is poor for all of them , since the expected tight correlation between @xmath7 and gmf slope @xcite , whereby clusters with a higher probability of disruption should always have a shallower gmf slope , is not observed (;",
    "@xcite ) . rather than an error in the models ,",
    "this is possibly the result of the large uncertainties affecting their input parameters , especially the clusters orbits and exact shape of the galactic potential .",
    "( for example , the redetermination of the orbit of ngc6218 with respect to the hipparcos reference system has led to a value of @xmath7 in better agreement with the cluster s flat gmf than that based on the previous , less accurate orbit . )",
    "this situation is unlikely to improve much until the advent of space astrometry missions like gaia .",
    "the absence of a clear correlation with the effects of tidal stripping , on the other hand , could also be due , at least in part , to our imperfect understanding of the relation between the cluster s gmf and its fundamental structural parameters and their evolution in time . to explore this possibility",
    ", we have used the available data to search for possible signs of a more complex situation .",
    "we present in this letter the results of this study which indeed imply that there is more at work here than was thought up to now .",
    "specifically , we find that there is a systematic trend between the gmf slope @xmath8 and the central concentration parameter @xmath9 ( defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the tidal radius and core radius , respectively ) , in the sense that all five clusters above with a severely depleted gmf have an intermediate or low value of @xmath9 . on the contrary ,",
    "the twelve halo clusters in the sample studied by and @xcite have typically high central concentration ( @xmath13@xmath9@xmath14 @xmath15 ) and correspondingly much steeper gmf slopes , typically @xmath16 in the range @xmath17m@xmath2 . in the following sections , we explore in more detail the origin and nature of this trend and its possible explanations .",
    "the sample used in this investigation includes all gcs for which reliable luminosity functions ( lfs ) and mfs exist from deep hst or vlt photometry .",
    "this includes the twelve halo clusters studied by , the two bulge clusters ngc6352 and ngc6496 studied by @xcite and the five gcs , mentioned above , that have recently been shown to have a depleted gmf at the low - mass end .",
    "finally , we have added to the sample ngc288 , whose lf has been studied by @xcite with the hst and also reveals a paucity of low - mass stars .",
    "the complete sample is listed in table[tab1 ] , where column ( 1 ) gives the cluster name , column ( 2 ) the bibliographic reference , column ( 3 ) the mf index @xmath8 in the mass range @xmath17m@xmath2 , column ( 4 ) the value of the central concentration parameter @xmath9 and column ( 5 ) the total integrated magnitude @xmath18 , both from harris ( 1996 ) .",
    "lcccc ngc104 & a & @xmath19 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 + ngc288 & b & @xmath22 & @xmath23 & @xmath24 + ngc2298 & c & @xmath25 & @xmath26 & @xmath27 + pal5 & d & @xmath28 & @xmath29 & @xmath30 + ngc5139 & a & @xmath19 & @xmath31 & @xmath32 + ngc5272 & a & @xmath33 & @xmath34 & @xmath35 + ngc6121 & e & @xmath36 & @xmath37 & @xmath38 + ngc6218 & f & @xmath39 & @xmath40 & @xmath41 + ngc6254 & a & @xmath42 & @xmath43 & @xmath44 + ngc6341 & a & @xmath45 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 + ngc6352 & g & @xmath48 & @xmath49 & @xmath50 + ngc6397 & h & @xmath51 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 + ngc6496 & g & @xmath54 & @xmath29 & @xmath55 + ngc6656 & i & @xmath51 & @xmath56 & @xmath57 + ngc6712 & j & @xmath58 & @xmath59 & @xmath60 + ngc6752 & a & @xmath61 & @xmath52 & @xmath62 + ngc6809 & a & @xmath33 & @xmath63 & @xmath64 + ngc6838 & k & @xmath65 & @xmath66 & @xmath67 + ngc7078 & l & @xmath68 & @xmath52 & @xmath69 + ngc7099 & a & @xmath51 & @xmath52 & @xmath70 +    as for the value of @xmath8 , it has been derived as follows .",
    "for those clusters for which a gmf index exists from multi - mass models ( indicated by an asterisk following the cluster name ) , that value is used . for all other clusters ,",
    "@xmath8 is the index of the power - law mf that , once folded through the derivative of the mass  luminosity ( m  l ) relationship appropriate for the cluster s metallicity , best fits the lf measured near the half - mass radius ( @xmath71 ) , since there the mf is expected to closely approach the gmf @xcite . for clusters in the sample studied by , we adopted the same m ",
    "l used in that work , while for the remaining objects the m ",
    "l relationship of @xcite for the appropriate metallicity was used . as pointed out by ,",
    "since the lf of ngc6341 and ngc7099 were measured farther out in the cluster , namely at about four times the half - mass radius , in principle a small positive correction to the measured index @xmath8 should be applied to account for the steepening of the mf with increasing radial distance caused by mass segregation .",
    "this correction amounts to less than @xmath72 dex and is included in the values listed in table[tab1 ] .",
    "the correction being relatively small , however , none of our conclusions would change if we were to ignore it .    in figure[fig1 ]",
    "we show the run of @xmath8 as a function of @xmath9 from table[tab1 ] .",
    "it is immediately obvious that there are no high - concentration clusters with a shallow gmf .",
    "it also appears that a relatively low concentration is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a depleted gmf .",
    "the median value of @xmath9 ( @xmath73 ) splits the cluster population roughly in two groups , one with lower and one with higher concentration .",
    "the mean gmf index of the first group is @xmath74 , while the second has a much tighter distribution with @xmath75 .",
    "the average values and the associated @xmath76 uncertainties are shown as thick crosses in figure[fig1 ] . due to the large dispersion of @xmath8 at low concentration ,",
    "it is not possible to derive a precise correlation between @xmath9 and @xmath8 over the whole range spanned by these parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "the gmf becomes undoubtedly less steep as @xmath9 decreases .",
    "the relationship @xmath77 is a simple yet satisfactory eye - ball fit to the distribution ( dashed line in figure[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the result shown in figure1 is very surprising , since there is a clear absence of centrally concentrated clusters that are depleted in low - mass stars as one would expect of gcs undergoing tidal disruption , i.e. objects that should occupy the upper right quadrant of figure[fig1 ] .",
    "this is contrary to theoretical expectations , since the same relaxation mechanism that drives a cluster towards higher central density and , eventually , core collapse is also responsible for the dissolution of the cluster , via evaporation @xcite .",
    "therefore , as a cluster evolves dynamically in the course of its lifetime , one would expect that its gmf should become shallower at the low - mass end while the central concentration parameter should increase .",
    "put differently , severe mass loss should be a sufficient , yet not necessary , condition for core collapse . in this simple scheme",
    ", one would for instance expect that ngc2298 and ngc6218 , with @xmath78 should have a much denser core than ngc6397 with @xmath79 .",
    "clearly , this picture is not at all consistent with the results shown in figure[fig1 ] .",
    "that cluster concentration somehow creates variations in the imf is not a plausible explanation for the observed trend between @xmath9 and @xmath8 , since the star formation process could not possibly know about the future structural properties of the forming cluster . thus ,",
    "unless the high @xmath9 value of the densest clusters is primordial and a presently unknown mechanism exists whereby low - mass star formation is hampered in low density environments , the depletion at the low - mass end of the gmf must result from mass loss via dynamical evolution .",
    "it is possible that the clusters that have lost a significant fraction of their original mass have indeed undergone core collapse and have already recovered a normal radial density and surface brightness profile .",
    "a large body of theoretical studies exists on the evolution of gcs after core collapse @xcite , according to which they should undergo a homologous re - expansion , within a thermal timescale , triggered by the energy released by hardening binaries @xcite .",
    "this process , however , is not necessarily stable and can lead to re - collapse and subsequent gravothermal oscillations @xcite when the number of stars in the cluster exceeds a threshold that depends on the mass spectrum .",
    "@xcite show that for a salpeter imf the re - expansion of the core is stable up to @xmath80 , a value comparable with the estimated number of objects present in the most depleted clusters in our sample .",
    "it , therefore , appears plausible that these clusters may have re - expanded after core collapse . on the other hand , @xcite",
    "predict the observed core radius to expand over time as @xmath81 and it would take too long for the core to reach a size comparable to that of the pre - collapse phase , unless the core shrunk only marginally during collapse or current models under - estimate the observed size of @xmath82 during the collapse phase of a realistic multi - mass cluster with a finite number of stars .    the evaporation timescale increases with increasing total cluster mass @xmath83 ,",
    "so one could possibly understand the trend shown in figure[fig1 ] if clusters of lower central concentration were also those with lower mass .",
    "unfortunately , this is not easy to investigate as less than half the clusters in our sample have a relatively solid @xmath83 , based on multi - mass model fitting , while for the rest @xmath83 comes from the total luminosity , i.e. the integrated magnitude @xmath18 , by assuming a constant mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the value of @xmath18 is shown for each cluster in table[tab1 ] and no correlation is found between it and @xmath9 . similarly , no correlation exists between @xmath83 and @xmath9 for clusters with a reliable value of @xmath83 . for example , ngc2298 , ngc6218 and ngc6656 have masses in the ratio @xmath84 , but share the same concentration @xmath85 .",
    "conversely , ngc6397 is about half as massive as ngc6656 , but its @xmath9 is twice as large .    it may be argued that besides evaporation other tidal mechanisms are responsible for the depleted gmfs that we find .",
    "in fact , the compressive heating that gcs undergo when they cross the galactic plane ( disk shocking ) or venture close to the galactic centre ( bulge shocking ) can have a much stronger effect than evaporation , depending on the cluster s orbit @xcite .",
    "however , while bulge and disk shocks can cause significant mass loss @xcite , they will preferentially remove low - mass stars _ only if _ these have previously been pushed toward the cluster s periphery by mass segregation @xcite . even if for some gcs tidal shocks have been as important as ( or more important than ) internal two - body relaxation in determining the mass loss rate , the observed trend is still puzzling since in any case tidal shocks should accelerate the evolution of a cluster toward higher central density and core collapse ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "only initially very loose gcs ( @xmath86 ) are expected to quickly dissolve , via mass loss due to stellar evolution , before reaching core collapse @xcite .",
    "however , figure[fig1 ] shows that also clusters of intermediate concentration may undergo severe mass loss without necessarily showing signs of core collapse for as long as a hubble time .",
    "this behaviour is in principle consistent with the results of fokker  planck and n - body calculations of realistic clusters , including the effect of stellar evolution and two - body relaxation . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have investigated the temporal evolution of @xmath9 and @xmath8 for various initial conditions ( total mass , concentration , relaxation time and imf index ) .",
    "their models suggest that , unless the imf is very steep ( @xmath87 ) , energy equipartition and mass segregation will initially drive the cluster towards lower values of the central density , mainly because the cluster shrinks ( and therefore stars are lost ) more quickly than the core can contract .",
    "eventually the cluster undergoes core collapse , but how long this takes and whether the increase in the central concentration @xmath9 can measurably affect the surface brightness profile depends on the initial conditions and in particular on the imf slope . if the latter is very shallow ( @xmath88 ) , stellar evolution may remove enough mass from the cluster so that its core is reduced to just a few stars .",
    "even in the deepest collapse phase , no central cusp would be visible in the surface brightness profile .",
    "the predictions of @xcite and @xcite are difficult to compare directly to the actual data , since the measured value of @xmath9 , based on the surface brightness profile dominated by red - giant stars , is not a good tracer of the true cluster density",
    ". nevertheless , the overall picture seems compatible with figure[fig1 ] and their findings allow us to put forth the following hypotheses to explain the presence of clusters with a shallow gmf and low @xmath9 and the absence of objects with a shallow gmf and high @xmath9 .",
    "the dashed line in figure1 approximately traces the evolutionary path of gcs from their birth towards two opposite directions of increasing or decreasing concentration .",
    "clusters born with sufficiently high concentration ( @xmath89 ) evolve towards core collapse .",
    "mass loss can be important via stellar evolution in the first @xmath90gyr , and to a lesser extent via evaporation or tidal stripping throughout the life of the cluster , but the gmf at any time does not depart significantly from the imf .",
    "clusters with @xmath91 at birth also evolve towards core collapse , but mass loss via stellar evolution and , most importantly , via relaxation and tidal stripping proceeds faster , particularly if the orbit has a short perigalactic distance or frequent disk crossings .",
    "therefore , as the tidal boundary shrinks and the cluster loses preferentially low - mass stars , the gmf progressively flattens .",
    "this speeds up energy equipartition , but @xmath9 still decreases , since the tidal radius shrinks more quickly than the luminous core radius ( although the central density , particularly that of heavy remnants , is increasing ) .",
    "these clusters can eventually undergo core collapse , but this might only affect a few stars in the core , thereby making it observationally hard to detect .",
    "an alternative possibility is that there were imf variations .",
    "some clusters with shallow imf have undergone severe stellar mass - loss and have therefore expanded considerably .",
    "this has led to a lower @xmath9 and a shallower gmf ( larger @xmath8 ) because these systems were more prone to tidal stripping .",
    "most of these clusters have already disrupted but some survive for a long time in a state of low @xmath9 and large @xmath8 before collapse occurs",
    ". clusters with a steeper imf , on the other hand , have proceeded normally to core collapse .",
    "the problem with this alternative possibility is the absence of gcs with a shallow gmf slope and high concentration ( @xmath92 ) . since high initial concentration should lead to a rapid collapse phase @xcite and no mechanism",
    "is known that could steepen the gmf over time , originally massive clusters with a shallow imf and high @xmath9 should still be visible in the `` zone of avoidance '' ( upper right corner ) of figure[fig1 ] . admittedly , our sample is relatively small and we can not exclude that clusters exist in this region of the parameter space .",
    "in particular , gcs of high concentration ( @xmath93 ) and low total luminosity ( @xmath94 ) are potential candidates and their gmf should be investigated .",
    "conversely , clusters with low concentration and steep imf can have formed , ngc6809 being a good candidate .",
    "objects like these should follow the general evolution towards lower @xmath8 and possibly lower @xmath9 .",
    "the exact balance between decrease in @xmath8 and in @xmath9 should depend on the initial conditions , and particularly the initial mass ( which together with the tidal radius , set by the galactic potential , defines the relaxation time ) .",
    "therefore , until gcs are found in the `` zone of avoidance '' of figure[fig1 ] , it seems plausible that opposite evolutionary paths exist in the @xmath9-vs-@xmath8 plane for clusters born with different central concentration and/or on different orbits , but that the imf was the same or very similar for all of them . at low masses ,",
    "the imf of gcs must approach the steepest gmfs in our sample , while at higher masses it can not be much shallower than salpeter without mass loss via stellar evolution causing the rapid disruption of the cluster @xcite .",
    "we presently have no direct measurements of the gc imf above @xmath95m@xmath2 , but a value of @xmath96 is the preferred outcome of multi - mass michie  king models (; ; @xcite ) . in this sense ,",
    "the tapered power - law distribution proposed by @xcite remains a viable hypothesis for the imf of gcs .",
    "we have discovered an empirical correlation between the central concentration and the gmf slope of gcs , whereby only loose clusters have a shallow gmf .",
    "a low value of the central concentration seems , therefore , a necessary condition for extensive mass loss leading to cluster disruption . although it is possible that gcs formed with a certain degree of mass segregation and that some low - mass stars may have been lost due to tidal truncation before two - body relaxation could act upon them , all of the depleted clusters that we have studied have a dynamical structure consistent with their being in a condition of energy equipartition ( @xcite ; ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the observed trend between @xmath8 and @xmath9 can only be understood if either the depleted clusters have undergone collapse and have subsequently rebounded , or if they are proceeding unnoticed towards core collapse or have already reached it without showing it . in either case , this means that the central concentration parameter @xmath9 derived from the surface brightness profile is not a good tracer of a cluster s true central density or dynamical state .",
    "our current estimate of the fraction of post - core collapse clusters may therefore need a complete revision as a large number of them may be lurking in the milky way .",
    "a reliable assessment of a cluster s dynamical state requires the study of the complete radial variation of its stellar mf .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee whose thorough comments and suggestions have helped us to considerably improve the presentation of this paper .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank torsten bker and andres jordn for very useful discussions .",
