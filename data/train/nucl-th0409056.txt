    "the shape coexistence in @xmath1si has been studied for a long time . at the early stage ,",
    "the oblate and prolate solutions of hartree - fock calculations are associated with the ground @xmath5 state and the @xmath6 state at 6.691 mev , respectively@xcite .",
    "experimentally , the ground band is known to be oblate from the sign of the quadrupole moment of the @xmath7 state , while the the band - head @xmath6 in the prolate band has been identified by gamma transition measurements@xcite",
    ".    the coexistence of oblate and prolate states in @xmath1si can be described by the shell gap at @xmath0 and @xmath8 of nilsson orbits in the deformed system @xcite .",
    "a variety of shapes is considered to arise from the nature of the shell structure in @xmath0 and/or @xmath8 systems , where a half of the @xmath9-shell is occupied .",
    "it is natural to expect that shape coexistence phenomena may appear also in neutron - rich nuclei with @xmath0 . from the coexistence of oblate and prolate states in @xmath1si",
    ", one may expect that this trend of the oblate and prolate neutron structure might survive in other @xmath0 isotones .",
    "the primary interest in the present paper is on the deformations of the proton and neutron densities in neutron excess @xmath0 nuclei .",
    "how does the oblate neutron structure in the ground band of @xmath1si change with the decrease of proton number toward the neutron - rich region ? whether or not the coexistence of oblate and prolate deformations occurs ?",
    "the neutron deformations should be sensitive to the proton structure , therefore , the shape coexistence of the neutron structure may depend on the proton number .",
    "if a oblate neutron shape is favored also in neutron - rich nucleus as well as in @xmath1si , one may meet another question : is the proton shape consistent with the neutron one ? in this sense , @xmath4ne is an attractive nucleus , where the proton shape would be different from the neutron shape , because the prolate shape of proton density is favored in @xmath10 systems as seen in @xmath11ne .    in the study of proton and neutron deformations",
    ", the experimental data of electric moments such as @xmath12 are useful to extract information about the intrinsic deformations .",
    "recently , @xmath13 in @xmath4si has been measured by coulomb excitation @xcite .",
    "the measured @xmath12 in @xmath4si is almost as large as the experimental value of @xmath12 in @xmath4ne .",
    "the ratio @xmath14si)/@xmath14ne)@xmath15 is much smaller than a naive expectation based on a collective model picture that @xmath12 is proportional to @xmath16 . if these nuclei are mirror symmetric , the ratio @xmath14si)/@xmath14ne)@xmath15 lead to a possible difference between proton and neutron deformations in @xmath4ne .",
    "the coexistence of the oblate and prolate solutions in @xmath1si has been confirmed by many theoretical calculations such as nilsson - strutinsky calculations@xcite , hartree - fock - bogoliubov@xcite , alpha - cluster model approaches@xcite .",
    "although mean field approaches are useful for systematic study of deformations , their applicability to very light nuclei is not obvious . in the light nuclear region",
    ", we would like to remind the readers of the importance of cluster aspect , which closely relates with the deformations .",
    "the cluster aspect has been suggested also in light neutron - rich nuclei as well as stable nuclei .",
    "for example , it is well known that @xmath11ne has a @xmath17o+@xmath18 cluster structure , while the development of clustering was suggested in neutron - rich b isotopes .",
    "the cluster aspect and the shape coexistence of even - even @xmath19 nuclei has been studied by @xmath18-cluster models @xcite .",
    "7@xmath18-cluster model calculations were applied to @xmath1si , and succeeded to describe an exotic shape with @xmath20 symmetry @xcite , which is associated with the @xmath21 band observed in gamma transitions@xcite .",
    "although the properties of the oblate and prolate states were described by the 7@xmath18-cluster models @xcite , however , many 7@xmath18-cluster calculations failed to reproduce the order of the oblate and prolate solutions in @xmath1si .",
    "namely , in most of the @xmath18-cluster calculations , the prolate solutions are lower than the oblate solutions except for few calculations with brink - beoker forces @xcite . for the oblate property of the ground state in @xmath1si , it is important to incorporate the effect of spin - orbit force , which is omitted within the @xmath18-cluster models .",
    "furthermore , the cluster models are not suitable for the systematic study of unstable nuclei , because they replies on the assumption of existence of cluster cores .    for the systematic structure study of light nuclei ,",
    "one of the powerful approaches is the method of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) .",
    "the applicability of this method for unstable nuclei has been proved in many works @xcite .",
    "in addition to description of deformations and cluster aspect in light nuclei , this method has an advantage that electric moments can be directly related with structure change based on the microscopic treatment of spin - parity projection without introducing effective charges .    in this paper",
    ", we study the deformations of @xmath0 isotones while focusing on the coexistence of the oblate and prolate neutron structure .",
    "we pay attention to reproduction of the order of oblate and prolate solutions , which coexist in @xmath1si , and discuss the effect of the spin - orbit force .",
    "we analyze the systematics of deformations in the neutron excess nuclei in relation to the observables such as @xmath2-moments and @xmath3 transitions strength .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section , the formulation of amd is briefly explained .",
    "we show the theoretical results and give comparisons with the experimental data in sec.[sec : results ] . in sec.[sec : discuss ] , we analyze the instrinsic structure , and discuss the lowering mechanism of the oblate state within the amd framework .",
    "finally , a summary is given in sec.[sec : summary ] .",
    "here we briefly explain the formulations of the present calculations .",
    "details of the formulation of amd methods for nuclear structure studies are explained in refs.@xcite .",
    "the present calculations are basically same as those in ref.@xcite .    the wave function of a system with a mass number @xmath22 is written by a superposition of amd wave functions @xmath23 .",
    "an amd wave function is given by a single slator determinant of gaussian wave packets as , @xmath24 where the @xmath25-th single - particle wave function is written as , @xmath26 the iso - spin function @xmath27 is fixed to be up(proton ) or down(neutron ) , and the orientation of intrinsic spin @xmath28 is fixed to be @xmath29 or @xmath30 in the present calculations as done in ref.@xcite . the spatial part is represented by complex variational parameters , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , which indicate the centers of gaussian wave packets .    in the amd model ,",
    "all the centers of single - nucleon gaussians are treated independently as the complex variational parameters .",
    "thus , this method is based completely on single nucleons and therefore it does not rely on the assumption of the existence of cluster cores . in the sense that a single amd wave function is written by a slator determinant of gaussians ,",
    "the amd method is regarded as an extended model of bloch - brink cluster model@xcite . here",
    "we note that the gaussian center is expressed by the complex parameter @xmath34 which contains a real part and imaginary part .",
    "it means an extension of the model space , because the degrees of freedom are twice of the case that gaussian centers are given by real values as in usual cluster models .",
    "if we ignore the effect of antisymmetrization , the position @xmath35 and the momentum @xmath36 of the @xmath25-th single - nucleon wave packets are expressed by the real and imaginary parts of @xmath34 , respectively as , @xmath37 in the nuclear structure study with the amd , the imaginary parts of * z * are essential to describe the rotation motion of the system .",
    "they are important to incorporate the effect of spin - orbit force and to describe high - spin states .",
    "we perform energy variation for a parity - eigen state , @xmath38 , projected from an amd wave function by using the frictional cooling method@xcite .",
    "we consider the amd wave function obtained by the energy variation as the intrinsic state , and total - angular - momentum projection(@xmath39 ) is performed after the variation to calculate the expectation values of operators such as energies and moments . in the present calculations ,",
    "the parity projection is done before the variation , but the total - angular - momentum projection is performed after the variation . in many of @xmath0 isotones ,",
    "two local minimum solutions are found in the energy variation . in such cases , we diagonalize the hamiltonian and norm matrices , @xmath40 and @xmath41 with respect to the obtained intrinsic wave functions ( @xmath42,@xmath43 ) and the @xmath44-quantum ( @xmath45 ) . after the diagonalization",
    "the ground and excited bands are obtained .",
    "the effective nuclear interactions adopted in the present work consist of the central force , the spin - orbit force and coulomb force .",
    "we adopt mv1 force @xcite as the central force .",
    "the mv1 force contains a zero - range three - body force in addition to the two - body interaction .",
    "the bertlett and heisenberg terms are chosen to be @xmath46 .",
    "we use a parameter set , case 1 of mv1 force with the majorana parameter @xmath47 . concerning the spin - orbit force , the same form of the two - range gaussian as the g3rs force @xcite",
    "is adopted .",
    "the strengths of the spin - orbit force , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 mev are used .",
    "we calculate the natural parity states of @xmath0 nuclei,@xmath50b , @xmath11c , @xmath51o , @xmath4ne and @xmath1si , with the amd method .",
    "the width parameters @xmath52=0.145 , 0.15 , 0.150 , 0.155 , 0.15 are chosen for @xmath50b , @xmath11c , @xmath51o , @xmath4ne and @xmath1si , respectively , so as to minimize the energy of each nucleus .    in these @xmath0 nuclei , we find two local minimum solutions with oblate and prolate deformations of neutron density , except for the results of @xmath11c and @xmath51o with @xmath49 mev .",
    "it signifies the trend of the shape coexistence of neutron structure in the @xmath0 isotones .",
    "the feature of the shape coexistence originates in the nature of @xmath0 neutron structure .    after performing the total - angular - momentum projection and the diagonalization for the obtained oblate and prolate states ,",
    "we obtain rotational bands , @xmath53 and @xmath54 bands in @xmath50b , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 bands in @xmath4ne and @xmath1si from the two local minimum solutions . in the calculations of @xmath11c and @xmath51o with the stronger spin - orbit force @xmath49 mev ,",
    "the shape coexistence phenomena disappear and only one intrinsic state is obtained by the energy variation in each nucleus . in the calculations with @xmath49 mev , the lowest states of @xmath51o and @xmath4ne have small prolate deformations of neutron density .",
    "as mentioned later , these states with small prolate deformations should be classified as the oblate states in the analysis of the shape coexistence in @xmath0 systems , because their properties are similar to those of the oblate states of other @xmath0 nuclei .",
    "therefore , we call these lowest states of @xmath51o and @xmath4ne as oblate states in this paper .    the energies of the band - head states are shown in fig.[fig : n14ls ] . in the results with @xmath57 mev",
    ", we find that oblate and prolate bands coexist in those @xmath0 nuclei .",
    "the oblate and prolate bands are almost degenerate in @xmath11c and @xmath51o , while in @xmath50b , @xmath4ne and @xmath1si the prolate bands are lower than the oblate ones . with the stronger spin - orbit force @xmath49 mev , the oblate solutions are the lowest in all of these nuclei .",
    "namely , the ground bands have the oblate neutron shapes .",
    "the prolate bands appear as excited bands in @xmath50b , @xmath4ne and @xmath1si .",
    "we can not find prolate solutions in @xmath11c and @xmath51o in the calculation with @xmath49 mev .",
    "the ground state of @xmath1si is experimentally known to be oblate .",
    "the order of the oblate and prolate bands is well reproduced by the calculations with @xmath49 mev . on the other hand ,",
    "the calculations with @xmath57 mev tend to relatively overestimate the energy of the oblate bands , and they fail to reproduce the order of the oblate and prolate solutions in @xmath1si . comparing the results with @xmath57 mev and @xmath49 mev , it is found that the relative energy of the oblate and prolate states in @xmath0 system is very sensitive to the strength of the spin - orbit force . in order to describe the oblate feature of the ground state of @xmath1si ,",
    "the effect of the spin - orbit force is significant as follows . in comparison of the results for the stronger spin - orbit force(@xmath49 mev ) with those for weaker one(@xmath57",
    "mev ) in fig.[fig : n14ls ] , we find that the energy gains in the oblate states are as large as about 10 mev , while the energies of prolate states are almost unchanged with the increase of the strength of the spin - orbit force .",
    "as shown in table [ tab : ls ] , the absolute value of the spin - orbit term is much larger in the oblate states than in the prolate states .",
    "it indicates that the energy gain of the spin - orbit force in the oblate state is essential to describe the level structure of @xmath1si .",
    "the stronger spin - orbit force @xmath49 is appropriate in the present framework for describing the order of the oblate and prolate levels in @xmath1si .",
    "we discuss the lowering mechanism of the oblate states in section [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "next , we show the level scheme obtained with @xmath49 mev in fig.[fig : n14spe ] .    in @xmath50b , we predict the coexistence of oblate and prolate bands . in the previous amd calculations of b isotopes@xcite ,",
    "the prolate shape in the ground state was predicted in @xmath50b .",
    "this is because the adopted spin - orbit force was too weak in the previous calculations .",
    "on the other hand , when we use the stronger spin - orbit force , which reproduces the order of the oblate and prolate bands in @xmath1si , we obtain the ground state of @xmath50b with the oblate neutron shape while the prolately deformed state appears above the ground state .",
    "as shown later , the excited prolate band has @xmath58li+@xmath59he - like cluster structure .",
    "although the 2-neutron separation energy of @xmath50b is very small as about 0.1 mev , we expect that the prolate states may exist as resonances because such cluster states might be stable against neutron decays .    in @xmath51o",
    ", we obtain the ground state but can not find other excited states in the present calculations .",
    "this is because of the double shell - closed feature of @xmath51o .",
    "namely , the intrinsic state has mostly spherical shape among the @xmath0 nuclei due to the effects of the neutron @xmath60 sub - shell closure and the proton magic number @xmath61 .    in the results of @xmath4ne ,",
    "the lowest oblate band in the theoretical results corresponds to the ground band of experimental data as discussed in the next section . on the other hand ,",
    "the excited prolate bands are not experimentally identified yet . in the present calculations ,",
    "a side - band @xmath62 of the oblate ground is suggested in addition to the excited prolate band .    in @xmath1si , the shape coexistence of the oblate ground band and the prolate",
    "excited band has been known .",
    "the prolate band , which starts from the band - head @xmath6 state at 6.691 mev , has been identified in gamma - transition measurements@xcite .",
    "the @xmath56 state at 4.979 mev in the experimental data is considered to be a vibrational excitation in the oblate state .",
    "the level structure of the oblate and prolate bands are reproduced by the present calculations .",
    "the level spacing between oblate and prolate bands can be reproduced in good agreement by using a slightly stronger spin - orbit force @xmath63 mev which gives 7.3 mev excitation energy for the band - head state of the prolate band .",
    "the theoretical results of the root - mean - square matter radii , @xmath3 transition strengths , and electric and magnetic moments are shown in fig.[fig : rmsr ] and tables [ tab : be2 ] and [ tab : qmom ] in comparison with the experimental data .",
    "the present calculations reasonably agree to the experimental data .",
    "[ tab : ls ] expectation values(mev ) of the spin - orbit force in the oblate and prolate states obtained with @xmath49 mev .",

    "in this section , we analyze the deformations of proton and neutron densities in the intrinsic states and discuss their effects on the observables such as @xmath3 transitions .",
    "the following discussions are based on the calculations with @xmath64=2800 mev .      as mentioned before ,",
    "two local minimum states are obtained in each system except for @xmath11c and @xmath51o .",
    "the deformation parameters @xmath65 , @xmath66 for neutron and proton densities in the intrinsic states are shown in fig.[fig : defo - n14 ] .",
    "the definition of @xmath65 , @xmath66 are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : dense ] shows the distribution of matter , proton and neutron densities . as seen in figs.[fig : defo - n14 ] and [ fig : dense ] , the lowest states of @xmath50b , @xmath11c and @xmath1si have oblate neutron shapes .",
    "although the lowest states of @xmath51o and @xmath4ne have small prolate deformations of neutron densities , we notice that the characteristics of the neutron structure in these states are rather similar to those in the oblate states of other @xmath0 nuclei .",
    "one of the remarkable features of the oblate neutron structure is the larger energy gain of the spin - orbit force than the prolate neutron structure .",
    "in fact , the energy gains of the spin - orbit force in these states of @xmath51o and @xmath4ne are as large as those in the oblate states in @xmath50b , @xmath11c and @xmath1si as seen in fig.[fig : n14ls ] and table [ tab : ls ] .",
    "it is considered that the oblately deformed neutron structure is not rigid but is somehow soft to vary into the small prolate deformation in such systems as @xmath51o and @xmath4ne , which have the spherical and prolate proton shapes , respectively . in other words ,",
    "the oblate neutron deformations can be modified because of the inconsistency with the proton deformations .",
    "it should be stressed that the features of the shape coexistence of neutron structure in @xmath0 nuclei varies depending on the proton number .    in @xmath50b ,",
    "the lowest state has the oblate neutron shape and a triaxial proton shape , while in the excited state the large prolate deformation with a cluster structure is enhanced . as seen in fig.[fig : dense ] , the developed @xmath67he+@xmath58li - like clustering is suggested in the prolate excited band .    in the lowest state of @xmath11c ,",
    "both the proton and neutron shapes are oblate .",
    "the reason for the absence of the prolate solution in @xmath11c is understood as follows . as known in @xmath68c , the proton shape is oblate in @xmath69 nuclei . because of the inconsistency with the oblate proton deformation , the prolate neutron structure is energetically unfavored comparing with the oblate neutron structure .    in @xmath51o , the neutron deformation is the smallest among these @xmath0 isotones due to the spherical proton shape which originates in the @xmath70-shell closure effect .",
    "another local minimum solution with the large prolate deformation of neutron structure does not appear as well as in @xmath11c .    in @xmath4ne ,",
    "two local minimum solutions with different neutron structures are obtained .",
    "the neutron structure of the lowest state has a smaller prolate deformation than that of the excited state .",
    "this smaller neutron deformation in the lowest state can be attributed to the oblate neutron structure in @xmath0 systems , because as mentioned above the sensitivity of the energy of this state to the strength of the spin - orbit force is quite similar to that of the oblate states in other @xmath0 isotones . on the other hand , in the excited state",
    ", the neutron structure has a large prolate deformation and is similar to the prolate excited state of @xmath1si .",
    "therefore , the coexistence of two local minimum solutions in @xmath4ne is associated with the shape coexistence of the oblate and prolate states in @xmath1si .",
    "one of the unique features in @xmath4ne is that the proton deformations are prolate in both the ground and excited states .",
    "it is because of the nature of @xmath10 systems . due to the effect of prolate proton deformation ,",
    "the oblate neutron structure varies into the small prolate deformation . as a result",
    ", the deformation parameters @xmath71 and @xmath72 for the proton and neutron densities are inconsistent with each other as @xmath73 .",
    "this leads to a difference between proton and neutron deformations in the ground state of @xmath4ne .",
    "the details of the different deformations are discussed later in relation to the @xmath3 transition strengths .    in the results of @xmath1si ,",

    "the main reason for the failures in describing the deformation of the ground state of @xmath1si in the 7@xmath18-cluster calculations is because the spin - orbit force is omitted in the @xmath18-cluster models .",
    "as seen in the nilsson orbits@xcite , the spin - orbit force plays an important role to make the shell gap at @xmath0 in the oblate system .",
    "it means that the spin - orbit force is significant to gain the energies of the oblate states in @xmath0 systems .",
    "here we explain the lowering mechanism of the oblate state in @xmath1si within the amd model space .    as described in [ subsec : intrinsic ] , in the results of @xmath1si it is found that the positions @xmath35(the real part of @xmath92 ) of gaussian centers correspond to the 7@xmath18-like cluster configurations ( fig.[fig:7alpha ] ) .",
    "if the imaginary parts of the gaussian centers are zero , the expectation value of the spin - orbit force vanishes because it is exactly zero in the systems composed of the ideal @xmath75-@xmath18 clusters .",
    "however , in the intrinsic state of the oblate band , we find that the non - zero imaginary parts of the gaussian centers cause the rotational motion .",
    "the positions and the momenta of the single - nucleon gaussian wave packets are given by the real parts @xmath93 and imaginary parts @xmath94 of the gaussian centers ( @xmath92 ) as given in eq.[eq : dk ] .",
    "@xmath93 and @xmath94 in the intrinsic state of the oblate ground band of @xmath1si are plotted in fig.[fig : rotation ] .",
    "the positions and momenta for up - spin and down - spin nucleons are shown by square and circle points , respectively .",
    "the correlation between @xmath95 and @xmath96 indicates the rotational motion around the @xmath97-axis .",
    "namely , the angular momenta of the up - spin nucleons are parallel to the @xmath97-axis and those of the down - spin nucleons are anti - parallel .",
    "therefore , the rotational motions for up - spin nucleons and the down - spin nucleons are reverse to each other , and make the spin - orbit force attractive . the energy gain of the spin - orbit force",
    "is more than @xmath98 mev as shown in table [ tab : ls ] . in the @xmath99-th @xmath18-like cluster ,",
    "the momenta @xmath100 for the up - spin proton and neutron are opposite to those @xmath101 for the down - spin proton and neutron as @xmath102 as shown in fig.[fig : rotation ] .",
    "although the positions @xmath35 are located in the @xmath103-like cluster configurations , it is important that the @xmath18-like clusters are dissociated due to the imaginary parts @xmath36 , because the gaussians for the up - spin nucleons are moving in the reverse to the down - spin nucleons in each of @xmath18-like clusters .",
    "thus , in the amd framework , the spin - orbit force can be gain while keeping the @xmath18-like cluster configurations .",
    "the energy gain of the spin - orbit force arises from the flexibility of the amd wave functions where gaussian centers are expressed by complex variational parameters instead of real parameters .",
    "we studied the deformations of @xmath0 isotones , @xmath50b , @xmath11c , @xmath51o , @xmath4ne and @xmath1si , while focusing on the shape coexistence of the oblate and prolate neutron structure .",
    "the relative energies between the oblate and prolate states are found to be sensitive to the strength of spin - orbit force . by using a set of interaction parameters",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath49 mev in the mv1(case 1)+g3rs force , we can describe the properties of the shape coexistence in @xmath1si , which is known to have the oblate ground band and the prolate excited band .",
    "the present results reasonably agree to the experimental data of radii , moments , and @xmath3 transition strengths .    in the present calculations ,",
    "the solutions with the oblate neutron structure are energetically favored and form the ground bands in these @xmath0 isotones . in the results of @xmath50b , the prolately deformed excited band with cluster structure was predicted to appear above the oblate ground state . in @xmath4ne , we proposed a possible difference between proton and neutron deformations in the ground band .",
    "we discussed @xmath2-moments and @xmath3 transition strengths in relation to the intrinsic deformations . in the analysis of the results",
    ", it was found that the spin - orbit force plays an important role in the lowering mechanism of the oblate neutron structure in @xmath0 systems .",
    "we found that the imaginary parts of the single - nucleon gaussian centers in the amd model space are important to gain the spin - orbit force .",
