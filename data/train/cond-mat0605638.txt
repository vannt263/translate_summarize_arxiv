    "the universal equation of state for the landau - ginzburg - wilson @xmath10 model remains a subject of great interest ( see , for instance , @xcite and @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "its calculation from first principles is much more difficult than the calculation of other universal quantities , such as critical exponents or amplitude ratios .",
    "the universal equation of state for the scaling function exhibits crossover behavior between three distinct , asymptotic regimes - the critical region when approached from the critical isotherm , or when approached along the critical isochor , and the coexistence curve .",
    "maintaining the correct analyticity properties of the equation of state in all these three distinct regimes has not been possible within the confines of first principle calculations , such as from a field - theoretic , microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "rather , appeal has been made to a parameterized phenomenological scaling ansatz @xcite that exhibits the right asymptotics , the underlying microscopic theory then being used to fix various free parameters that exist in the ansatz .",
    "in this paper we use a renormalization group methodology - environmentally friendly renormalization @xcite - based only on an underlying landau - ginzburg - wilson hamiltonian and without the need for any phenomenological ansatz , to derive an equation of state that exhibits all desired analyticity properties in the three distinct asymptotic regimes .",
    "as first noted by widom @xcite , in the critical region , the equation of state is a homogeneous function relating an external magnetic field @xmath11 , the reduced temperature @xmath12 , and the magnetization @xmath13 , which can be expressed by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is universal , the scaling variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are non - universal amplitudes associated with the behavior on the critical isotherm @xmath22 and the coexistence curve @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the scaling function @xmath15 is normalized such that @xmath25 on the critical isotherm , and @xmath26 on the coexistence curve .",
    "several properties of the universal equation of state are known rigorously .",
    "for instance , it is known that @xmath15 has a regular taylor expansion around the limit @xmath27 given by @xmath28 while in the limit @xmath2 , by griffith s analyticity , one has an expansion of the form @xmath29 in the limit @xmath30 a natural variable is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and the @xmath33 are the amplitudes of the @xmath34-point correlation functions for @xmath35 , @xmath36 being the amplitude of the susceptibility . in terms of @xmath37",
    "the equation of state takes the form @xmath38 where the universal scaling function @xmath39 for small @xmath37 has an expansion of the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 by choice of normalization . as ( [ expansioninz ] )",
    "is an expansion in @xmath13 , the constants @xmath42 are related to the @xmath34-point correlation functions at @xmath43 and hence are very natural observables to calculate in lattice simulations . in the limit @xmath44 , @xmath39 has an expansion of the form @xmath45 the universal scaling functions @xmath15 and @xmath39 are related via @xmath46 with @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the universal zero of the equation of state in terms of the variable @xmath37 .",
    "hence , the expansion coefficients of the two functions can be related to find @xmath49 thus , we see it is sufficient to know the expansion coefficients of @xmath15 in the limits @xmath1 and @xmath50 in order to calculate the asymptotic properties of @xmath39 and the interesting coefficients @xmath42 .    unlike the limits @xmath1 and @xmath50 , near the coexistence curve , @xmath3 , there are no rigorous mathematical arguments as to the analyticity properties of @xmath15 , although there do exist conjectures . for instance , for @xmath51 in @xcite , based on an @xmath52-expansion analysis , it was conjectured that @xmath53 has a double expansion in powers of @xmath16 and @xmath54 of the form @xmath55 in three dimensions it predicts an expansion of @xmath53 in powers of @xmath56 .",
    "of course , the behavior in the vicinity of the coexistence curve depends on the value of @xmath57 . for @xmath7 ,",
    "the longitudinal correlation length remains finite away from the critical point on the coexistence curve , while for @xmath51 , the existence of goldstone bosons leads to infrared singularities . for @xmath7",
    ", one may formally posit that in the vicinity of the coexistence curve @xmath58 the integer powers being a reflection of the finite longitudinal correlation length . for ising - like",
    "systems essential singularities are to be expected .",
    "of course , these can not be captured within the confines of an ansatz like ( [ ansatzcoex ] ) . for @xmath51 studies of the non - linear @xmath59 model",
    "lead one to expect a leading behavior of the form @xmath60 though , as mentioned , the nature of the corrections to this behavior is not well understood , although ( [ coexi ] ) is one conjecture . in the @xmath61 expansion",
    "there is some evidence @xcite for logarithmic corrections of the form @xmath62 in three dimensions .",
    "early field theoretic calculations using the renormalization group with an @xmath52-expansion @xcite foundered on the fact that they did not exhibit griffiths analyticity in the large @xmath17 limit .",
    "irrespective of the expansion method - @xmath52- , fixed - dimension , @xmath61 etc .",
    "- there will remain a fundamental difficulty - that an expansion around a particular fixed point will not readily access the universal equation of state in the entire phase diagram , due to the presence of other fixed points that must be accessed .",
    "simply put , the equation of state exhibits crossovers , and the nature of these crossovers depends on @xmath57 . for @xmath7 the theory is controlled by a `` gaussian '' or mean - field fixed point , wherein fluctuations are suppressed on the coexistence curve away from the critical point by the non - vanishing longitudinal mass . in distinction , for @xmath51 ,",
    "the theory is dominated by the massless goldstone excitations on the coexistence curve and the non - linear @xmath59 model gives a good description @xcite .",
    "the problem of incorporating griffiths analyticity was solved by using a parameterized formulation in terms of new variables @xmath63 and @xmath64 , related to @xmath12 and @xmath13 via @xmath65 where the two functions @xmath66 and @xmath67 are undetermined . in this new parameterization the scaling variable @xmath17 and the scaling function @xmath15",
    "are given by @xmath68    most current field theoretic formulations for determining the equation of state ( see @xcite for comprehensive reviews ) rely on such formulations .",
    "the drawback is that the underlying microscopic theory is not used to determine the functional form of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , rather an ansatz is made as to the general functional form which depends on certain unknown parameters and then the underlying microscopic theory is used to fix these parameters .",
    "the most common ansatz is that the functions are polynomials in @xmath64 .",
    "the coefficients of the powers of @xmath64 are then determined by calculating certain observables independently from the underlying microscopic theory and then using the values of these observables to determine the coefficients .",
    "various methodologies have been used @xcite using a variety of methods .",
    "for instance , an expansion of the effective potential for small @xmath13 for @xmath69 using @xmath70 or fixed dimension expansions . results from monte - carlo simulations or high temperature expansions have also been used .    in this paper",
    "we apply a new method to describe the equation of state in a uniform manner . using environmentally friendly renormalization@xcite",
    ", we find a schema able to capture the crossover between the wilson - fisher fixed point and the fixed point that controls the coexistence curve . by integrating along curves of constant magnetization",
    ", we obtain the equation of state in the whole critical region .",
    "moreover , the equation of state that we obtain is parameterized in terms of the inverse of the transverse correlation length , a quantity well defined over the entire phase diagram .",
    "the representation we have found is valid for both large and small values of the scaling variables and satisfies griffiths analyticity .",
    "although our approach works for any @xmath57 we here concentrate on the case @xmath7 .",
    "in this section we briefly outline the derivation of the equation of state for a theory described by the standard lgw hamiltonian with @xmath10 symmetry @xmath71=\\int\\ ! d^{d}x\\left({1\\over 2}\\nabla\\varphi^a\\nabla\\varphi^a \\!+{1\\over 2}r(x)\\varphi^a\\varphi^a \\!+{\\lambda_b\\over 4!}(\\varphi^a\\varphi^a)^2\\!\\right ) .",
    "\\label{hamilt } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the value of @xmath74 at the critical temperature @xmath75 and @xmath76 , @xmath77 being the microscopic scale .",
    "we denote a generic vertex function by @xmath78 , where the number of @xmath79 and @xmath12 subscripts indicates whether a longitudinal or a transverse propagator is to be attached to the vertex at the corresponding point .",
    "when all subscripts are either @xmath79 or @xmath12 we will use a single @xmath79 or @xmath12 , for example @xmath80 will be abbreviated @xmath81 .",
    "furthermore , when there are no @xmath82 insertions ( i.e. @xmath83 ) the second index will be left off e.g. @xmath84 indicates @xmath85 .    due to the ward identities of the model , it is sufficient to know only the @xmath81 , as all the other vertex functions can be reconstructed from these .",
    "the equation of state is @xmath86      due to the existence of large fluctuations in the critical regime a renormalization of the microscopic bare parameters of the form @xmath87 must be imposed , where @xmath88 is an arbitrary renormalization scale .",
    "the renormalized parameters satisfy the differential equations @xmath89 where the wilson functions associated with this coordinate transformation are @xmath90 and the derivative is taken along an appropriately chosen curve in the phase diagram , which we here denote by @xmath91 . similarly ,",
    "integration of the renormalization group equation for any multiplicatively renormalizable @xmath81 yields @xmath92 to impose a specific , as opposed to abstract , coordinate transformation between bare and renormalized theory the renormalization constants @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 must be fixed . here , we impose the explicitly magnetization dependent normalization conditions @xmath96 note that in this case we impose the normalization conditions on the transverse correlation functions .",
    "these conditions serve to fix the three @xmath97 functions associated with @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 while the condition @xmath101 serves as a gauge fixing condition that relates the sliding renormalization scale @xmath88 to the physical temperature @xmath12 and the physical magnetization @xmath13 .",
    "physically , @xmath88 is a fiducial value of the non - linear scaling field @xmath102 , which is the inverse transverse correlation length .    besides @xmath102",
    ", the other non - linear scaling field we use to parameterize our results is @xmath103 which is an rg invariant .",
    "it represents the anisotropy in the masses of the longitudinal and transverse modes and is related to the stiffness constant @xmath104 via @xmath105 .    with a given renormalization prescription",
    "one may determine the equation of state in terms of the non - linear scaling fields @xmath102 and @xmath106 , as the transverse and longitudinal propagators that appear in all perturbative diagrams can be parameterized in terms of them .",
    "one of the main motivations for this reparametrization in terms of non - linear scaling fields is that it eliminates all tadpole diagrams at higher loop order .",
    "however , what is required is the equation of state in terms of the linear scaling fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "one must therefore determine the coordinate transformation , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , between them .",
    "this may be done by specifying a particular curve , @xmath91 , in the phase diagram along which we integrate the differential relation for the tranverse vertex functions @xmath109 .",
    "for example , @xmath110 can be integrated along a curve of constant @xmath13 to yield @xmath111 , where the right hand side is naturally written in the coordinate system @xmath112 . to integrate the renormalization group equation for the vertex functions it is most natural to use @xmath113 as the flow variable and hold @xmath106 constant",
    ". however , if we then wish to integrate ( [ diffrelngtwo ] ) along a curve of constant @xmath13 we must include a jacobian factor , @xmath114 , that takes into account the variation of @xmath106 along a constant @xmath13 curve .",
    "the relation between @xmath106 and @xmath13 is specified by ( [ mfdef ] ) using the renormalization group equations for @xmath115 and @xmath116 with the normalization conditions ( [ nctwof ] ) and ( [ ncfourf ] ) . using ( [ gammanmrge ] ) for @xmath117 and @xmath118 and the normalization conditions ( [ ncthreef ] ) and ( [ nconef ] ) one may write @xmath119    in the universal limit , where @xmath120 , the crossover to mean field theory is pushed off to infinity and the theory is then controlled in the limit @xmath121 by the wilson - fisher fixed point .",
    "hence , @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the wilson function @xmath124 at the wilson - fisher fixed point .",
    "defining @xmath125 ( [ curveint ] ) yields @xmath126 to integrate ( [ curveinttwo ] ) we need to fix some boundary condition .",
    "the coexistence curve , where @xmath127 , is a natural one . in this case",
    ", @xmath128 integrates to the temperature variable @xmath129 , where @xmath130 corresponds to that point on the coexistence curve where the magnetization is @xmath13 .",
    "as we wish to use as temperature variable @xmath131 , we may write @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the temperature shift that measures the distance between the critical point and the point on the coexistence curve , @xmath130 . in the integral , @xmath134",
    ", one may safely take the universal limit , @xmath135 . in this universal scaling limit , in terms of the linear scaling fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the problem has only one scaling variable , @xmath17 . in terms of the coordinates @xmath102 and @xmath106 ,",
    "this manifests itself as a reduction to the single scaling variable , @xmath136 . passing to this variable , using ( [ mfdef ] ) , and integrating this along a curve of constant @xmath13 ( taking into account the jacobian factor ) one finds @xmath137 where the scaling variable @xmath138 , @xmath21 being the non - universal amplitude introduced previously , and the universal scaling function @xmath139 is @xmath140 where @xmath141 the quantity @xmath142 is related to the universal zero of the equation of state . in terms of the amplitude @xmath21 @xmath143    equation ( [ fundrelone ] ) determines the coordinate transformation , @xmath107 @xmath108 , in the scaling limit where there is only one relevant scaling variable associated with the linear scaling fields , @xmath144 , and one relevant scaling variable associated with the non - linear scaling fields , @xmath136",
    "hence , we determine the coordinate transformation @xmath145 .",
    "note that the geometry of this transformation has some unusual properties relative to the @xmath146 plane .",
    "the coexistence curve is mapped to the single point @xmath147 , the critical isotherm is mapped to the single point @xmath27 , and the critical isochor , for @xmath69 , maps to the single point at infinity .",
    "however , the critical point itself - as the intersection of the coexistence curve , critical isotherm and critical isochor - maps to all these points .    to proceed to the equation of state we use ( [ basiceqnofstate1 ] ) and the renormalization group equation for @xmath117 .",
    "once again , passing to the variable @xmath37 and including in the jacobian factor , one obtains @xmath148 where the universal scaling function @xmath149 is given by @xmath150 introducing the scaling variable @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is related to the non - universal amplitude @xmath20 via @xmath153 one sees that the universal equation of state is now of the form ( [ fscaling ] ) with @xmath154    we may now ask what more can be said about @xmath142 and @xmath152 , or whether they are simply non - universal parameters , being related to the non - universal amplitudes @xmath20 and @xmath21 , that can not be determined within the present formalism ?",
    "@xmath142 , in fact , is related to the universal zero of the equation of state , and may be calculated in the following manner : we choose some arbitrary value of @xmath37 , @xmath48 , and write @xmath155 ; then choose @xmath37 and @xmath48 in the asymptotic regime @xmath37 , @xmath156 , wherein , from griffith s analyticity , we can write @xmath157 . in the limit @xmath158 , depending on the value of @xmath159 , certain terms in the asymptotic expansion diverge .",
    "for instance , for the three dimensional ising model , at one loop , @xmath160 , hence , only the @xmath161 and @xmath162 terms diverge , while the contributions from @xmath163 . denoting the divergent part of the expansion as @xmath164 ;",
    "as @xmath48 is constant we may identify the non - constant term , @xmath165 , in this limit with @xmath164 .",
    "hence , we may identify @xmath166 . in terms of the integrand , @xmath167 , of the scaling function @xmath168 , we may write @xmath169 where @xmath170 is defined via @xmath171 .",
    "@xmath142 is clearly universal . to determine @xmath152",
    ", we set the condition @xmath172 on the critical isotherm @xmath22 .",
    "this corresponds to a particular value , @xmath173 , of @xmath37 .",
    "hence , @xmath174 . to determine @xmath173",
    "note that from ( [ te ] ) on the critical isotherm @xmath175 .",
    "the inversion of this function allows for the identification of @xmath173 .",
    "hence , we deduce @xmath152 to be @xmath176 which is , once again , a universal function .",
    "so , given that @xmath152 is determined from @xmath142 , and @xmath142 is determined from @xmath168 by subtracting off its divergent component as @xmath44 , we see that the simple ingredients that enter into a complete specification of the universal equation of state are the three wilson functions - @xmath177 , @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "these are the only quantities that need to be determined perturbatively ( or otherwise ) .",
    "note that this equation of state has been determined from a first principles calculation based on an underlying microscopic model .",
    "it is parameterized , but parameterized in a way that is completely determined by the underlying model .",
    "this is in distinction to standard parametric representations @xcite , where , after imposing certain analyticity requirements , there is a large arbitrariness in determining the scaling functions @xmath67 and @xmath66 . in fact , these functions may depend on an arbitrary number of parameters and , for each parameter , a universal quantity must be independently calculated in order to fix it . also , the parameter @xmath37 here has a much more transparent and direct physical meaning than @xmath64 , being simply the ratio of the two fundamental non - linear scaling fields in the problem - @xmath102 and @xmath106 - the transverse correlation length and the stiffness constant .",
    "as these quantities are well defined throughout the phase diagram this formulation has an added advantage relative to parametric , fixed - dimension expansions where the relevant non - linear scaling field used is the mass for @xmath35 and there are difficulties reaching the ordered phase @xcite .    in order to determine the expansion coefficients @xmath180 and @xmath181 , as introduced in section 1 , one requires the taylor expansion of @xmath15 around @xmath27 and @xmath182 . in terms of our parametric representation , @xmath183 can be expressed using @xmath184 , where @xmath185 hence , @xmath186 which need to be evaluated at the points of interest @xmath187 ( @xmath27 ) , @xmath188 ( @xmath182 ) and @xmath189 ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "for instance , taking the limit @xmath30 in ( [ te ] ) and ( [ ache ] ) , and using the fact that the wilson functions @xmath124 approach their values at the wilson - fisher fixed point so @xmath190 , one finds @xmath191 hence , @xmath192 from which , using ( [ athreefromaone ] ) we may identify the expansion coefficient @xmath193 which is related to the universal amplitude ratio @xmath194 via @xmath195 . using the expression for @xmath36 in our formulation , @xmath196 and equations ( [ bandaone ] ) and ( [ bcandathree ] ) , one can verify that ( [ fzeroinf ] ) is identical to the expression @xmath197 .",
    "similarly , using the expression for @xmath198 in our formulation @xmath199 one may determine the universal amplitude ratio @xmath200 to be @xmath201 with these two amplitude ratios in hand two - scale factor universality implies that any other may be determined .",
    "the advantages of the present formulation can be best illustrated by considering a concrete example .",
    "we will consider the universal equation of state in the one loop approximation , as at this level it is still possible to obtain analytic or `` quasi''-analytic results .",
    "we begin with the values of the wilson functions to one loop .",
    "the running dimensionless coupling @xmath202 satisfies @xmath203 where @xmath204 . taking the initial condition @xmath205 , in the limit @xmath206 ,",
    "@xmath120 one arrives at the universal separatrix solution @xmath207 on the separatrix @xmath208 in the limit @xmath44 , the wilson - fisher fixed point is approached and @xmath209 with , at one loop , @xmath210 and @xmath211 . on the contrary , in the limit @xmath212 the strong - coupling fixed point is approached and @xmath213 . for @xmath51",
    "the goldstone bosons dominate and @xmath214 . for @xmath7 however , this fixed point is mean - field like as fluctuations are suppressed and @xmath215 .    in the limit @xmath44 ,",
    "the wilson functions can be expanded as power series in @xmath216 for any @xmath57 @xmath217 hence , the universal scaling functions @xmath168 and @xmath218 can also be written as power series in @xmath216 .",
    "this is true in a diagrammatic expansion to all orders not just at one loop .",
    "the limit @xmath212 is more complicated . in this limit , @xmath219 but",
    "the nature of the corrections is not obvious . at the one - loop level , from ( [ wilsononeloopn ] )",
    ", one can see that the leading corrections to the strong coupling fixed point values will be @xmath220 .    for @xmath221 analytic progress",
    "is difficult .",
    "however , for @xmath7 these expressions simplify greatly yielding @xmath222    with these expressions one can explicitly calculate the scaling functions @xmath149 and @xmath139 @xmath223 to determine the constant @xmath142 we take the @xmath44 limit of ( [ fonelooparbitraryd ] ) , identify the divergent part with @xmath165 and the constant remainder with @xmath142 . note that the case @xmath224 is problematic .",
    "this is an artefact of the one - loop approximation where , in particular , in @xmath224 one has @xmath225 , which is clearly unphysical .",

    "<S> using an environmentally friendly renormalization we derive , from an underlying field theory representation , a formal expression for the equation of state , @xmath0 , that exhibits all desired asymptotic and analyticity properties in the three limits @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the only necessary inputs are the wilson functions @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , associated with a renormalization of the transverse vertex functions . </S>",
    "<S> these wilson functions exhibit a crossover between the wilson - fisher fixed point and the fixed point that controls the coexistence curve . restricting to the case @xmath7 , we derive a one - loop equation of state for @xmath8 naturally parameterized by a ratio of non - linear scaling fields . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath9 we show that a non - parameterized analytic form can be deduced . </S>",
    "<S> various asymptotic amplitudes are calculated directly from the equation of state in all three asymptotic limits of interest and comparison made with known results . by positing a scaling form for the equation of state inspired by the one - loop result , but adjusted to fit the known values of the critical exponents , we obtain better agreement with known asymptotic amplitudes . </S>"
