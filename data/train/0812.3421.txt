    "string theory is one of the most promising candidates for the fundamental microscopic physics , so it is very important to try to embed the inflation scenarios into string theory .",

    ". however , due to the cosmic variance and statistical errors , the low multipole moments have large error bars , the model prediction is consistent with the observational data .",
    "the above analyses show that the general brane inflation model can survive confronting the wmap five - year data . when considering the wmap five - year result of the spectral index , the model survives at the level of 1@xmath41 .",
    "this conclusion is different from that of the analysis of wmap three year data .",
    "it was indicated in @xcite that , with the wmap three year data , the brane inflation model for @xmath43 is near the boundary of the wmap3 only and can not fit the wmap3+sdss data at the level of 1@xmath41 ; the case with @xmath34 is outside the range allowed by wmap3 only or wmap3+sdss at the level of 1@xmath41 .",
    "so , we find that the wmap five - year data save the brane inflation model to the level of 1@xmath41 .         however , the brane inflation model discussed above is not a realistic model .",
    "an important problem is neglected in the above discussions , which is that the distance between the brane and the anti - brane must be larger than the size of the extra dimensional space if the inflation is slow rolling ( or @xmath44 is sufficiently small ) in this scenario .",
    "of course , there may exist such a possibility that the potential in ( [ potential1 ] ) can emerge in other theories that we do not know currently , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "the first realistic brane inflation model is the so - called kklmmt model @xcite that will be discussed in the subsequent section .",
    "the kklmmt model is set up in the type iib string theory . in this model ,",
    "the highly warped compactifications are considered , with all moduli stabilized by the combination of fluxes and non - perturbative effects @xcite .",
    "once a small number of @xmath13-branes are added , the vacuum can be successfully lifted to ds .",
    "furthermore , one can add an extra pair of d3-bane and @xmath13-brane in a warped throat , with the d3-brane moving towards the @xmath13-brane that is located at the bottom of the throat .",
    "the scenario of brane inflation can thus be realized .",
    "the warped geometry successfully solves the @xmath44 problem , i.e. , it can provide a natural mechanism for achieving a sufficiently flat potential . in this section",
    ", we shall discuss the kklmmt model with the wmap five - year results .",
    "consider a type iib orientifold compactified on a calabi - yau 3-fold with fluxes , where all moduli are stabilized @xcite .",
    "inside the bulk of the calabi - yau manifold , there are throats with warped geometry , where the metric has the approximate @xmath45 form , where @xmath46 is some orbifold of @xmath47 and the @xmath48 metric in poincare coordinates has the form @xcite @xmath49 where the @xmath50 is the warp factor @xmath51 in which @xmath52 is the radius of curvature of the @xmath48 throat .",

    ", we shall discuss how these observables provide constraints on the parameter @xmath0 of the kklmmt model .",
    "first , let s discuss the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath8 .",
    "the tensor - to - scalar ratio is an important observable that can distinguish the inflationary cosmology from other scenarios .",
    "also , it can be used to distinguish different inflation models because different models give distinctive predictions on this observable quantity .",
    "although the observations still have no ability to detect the primordial gravitational waves in a convincing manner , an upper limit could be given at least .",
    "now we try to see how this observable with such a loose upper - limit can set constraint on the kklmmt model . in fig .",
    "[ tensor1 ] , we plot the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath8 vs. the @xmath20-folding number @xmath21 for the kklmmt model , according to eq .",
    "( [ tensor ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ tensor1 ] , we see that the larger value the parameter @xmath0 takes , the greater value the tensor - to - scalar ratio will be .",
    "this is due to the fact that the greater the value of @xmath0 is , the faster the inflaton moves , so the larger tensor mode will be produced in the inflationary era @xcite .",
    "currently , the tightest constraint on @xmath8 is @xmath85 ( wmap5+snia+bao ) @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ tensor1 ] we see that the green curve ( corresponding to @xmath86 ) definitely violates this bound , and we learn that the parameter @xmath0 can not be greater than @xmath87 .",
    "hence , we find that even such a loose bound on @xmath8 gives a so small value of @xmath0 about @xmath88 , then the true value of @xmath0 must be fine - tuned to some extent .",
    "we hope the future cmb experiments could further constrain @xmath8 toward @xmath89 , providing true test on the kklmmt model .",
    "the above constraint on @xmath0 can also be examined from the field value perspective .",
    "we can calculate the change magnitude of the inflaton field from the moment when the fluctuations were generated to the end of inflation , @xmath90.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] according to @xcite , for a single field inflation model , the change magnitude of the field has a relationship with the tensor - to - scale ratio as @xmath91 we plot the change magnitude of the field as a function of @xmath92 for different e - folding number @xmath21 in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ field1 ] .",
    "it is very explicit that if @xmath93 , the change magnitude of the field will be definitely greater than the planck mass , which might not be consistent with the conditions of effective field theory @xcite .",

    "( [ field and tensor ] ) , if the change of the field during the whole period of inflation is less than the planck mass , the tensor - to - scalar ratio will be surely less than @xmath89 .",
    "thus , from right panel of fig . [ field1 ] , it can be inferred that @xmath0 should be less than @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , to satisfy the current constraint on the tensor - to - scalar ratio and the physical bound on the change magnitude of the field value , @xmath95 , the parameter @xmath0 could not be greater than @xmath87 , which is both an observational and a physical bound on the kklmmt model .      cosmic strings and other topological defects",
    "have long been proposed as one of the candidates for the origin of structure formation @xcite , however , it has been shown that this scenario leads to predictions incompatible with observations such as the power spectrum of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropy @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the brane / anti - brane inflation scenario inspired from string theory naturally indicates that cosmic strings would have a small contribution to the cmb , which is compatible with the observational limits @xcite . this has led to a significant revival of all aspects of cosmic string scenario , including new theoretical motivations , phenomenological implications and direct observational searches ,",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the possibility of detecting the signal of the cosmic strings through astronomical observations opens a significant window to test string theory .",
    "the current observational bound ( the upper limit ) for cosmic string tension from the cmb temperature is roughly @xcite @xmath96 and @xmath97 obviously , the kklmmt scenario predicts that the tension of these cosmic strings is very small and their contribution to cmb is well below the current limits @xcite .",
    "however , now , we try to do this inversely , i.e. , we intend to see how this observational bound puts a constraint on the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this may show what the loosest observational result can tell us .",
    "the @xmath36-brane collides with the @xmath98-brane at the end of inflation at the bottom of the throat .",
    "the annihilation of the d3-@xmath99-branes initiates the hot big bang epoch , meanwhile d1-branes ( i.e. d - strings ) and fundamental closed strings ( i.e. f - strings ) are also produced .",
    "the quantities of interest are the d - string tension @xmath100 and the f - string tension @xmath101 , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the effective tensions measured from the viewpoint of the four dimensional effective action .",
    "since in ten dimensions , there is the relationship @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the d3-brane tension , we have the tensions of the type iib string in the inflationary throat @xmath106 @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the string coupling .",
    "there are also bound states of @xmath109 f - strings and @xmath110 d - strings with a cosmic string network spectrum @xcite @xmath111 in eqs .",
    "( [ ftension ] ) and ( [ dtension ] ) both f - strings and d - strings are dependent on the string coupling @xmath108 , but the geometric mean @xmath112 is independent of @xmath108 .",
    "thus , we can define @xcite @xmath113 obviously , for f - string we have @xmath114 , and for d - string we have @xmath115 .",
    "the value of @xmath108 is likely in the range 0.1 to 1 @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath116 can be converted to @xmath117 by @xmath118-duality .",
    "then , combining with cobe normalization ( [ amplitude ] ) , we obtain the cosmic string tension in the kklmmt inflation model @xmath119    equation ( [ stension2 ] ) shows that the cosmic string tension @xmath120 depends both on the parameter @xmath0 and the number of e - folds @xmath21 .",
    "thus , in order to see how the cosmic string tension relies on the two parameters , we plot the correlation of @xmath21-@xmath0 according to the cosmic string tension @xmath120 in fig . [ figtension ] .    in fig .",
    "[ figtension ] , the upper - right corner is the not - allowed parameter region , since it represents a too large tension and it is excluded outside the @xmath121 cl .",
    "the smaller value the cosmic string tension takes , the deeper the curve will move toward the lower - left corner , which indicates a smaller parameter @xmath0 .",
    "according to the @xmath122 bound ( the red curve in fig .",
    "[ figtension ] ) , if one takes @xmath123 , the observational @xmath122 curve will give the tightest constraint on @xmath0 , namely @xmath124 ; if taking @xmath125 , the bound on the parameter @xmath0 from cosmic string tension will be looser , @xmath126 .",
    "thus , roughly speaking , the current observational bound on the cosmic string tension tells us the following information on the parameter @xmath0 , namely @xmath127 .",
    "the spectral index is certainly the most important observable that could distinguish different inflation models .",

    "so , only @xmath129 could give both the red - tilted scalar spectrum and the small field manner .",
    "this is due to the fact that a larger parameter @xmath0 will make the field rolling too fast , which might make the slow - roll parameter @xmath44 be positive .",

    "this is obvious because the spectral index is the very quantity that has been precisely measured while other quantities only get loose upper limits from the observations .",

    "we now pause to discuss the physical effect of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath0 goes larger , the potential @xmath133 will become steeper , which leads the inflaton to roll faster than the small @xmath0 case .",

    ", the @xmath36 and @xmath98-branes will have greater momentum to collide , producing more @xmath134-strings and @xmath135-strings .",
    "therefore , constraining the parameter @xmath0 is actually constraining the shape of the potential and the dynamics of inflation .",
    "the wmap three - year data give a rather red spectrum , i.e. @xmath136 ( 1@xmath41 cl ) for wmap3 data only , and @xmath137 ( 1@xmath41 cl ) for the combination of wmap3 and sdss data .",
    "therefore , such a red spectrum requires the parameter @xmath0 in the kklmmt to be fine - tuned . in @xcite , it has been shown that , with the wmap three - year data , the constraints on the parameter @xmath0 are @xmath138 at the level of 1@xmath41 and @xmath139 at the level of 2@xmath41 for wmap3 only ; @xmath140 at the level of 2@xmath41 for wmap3 + sdss .",

    "this is , without doubt , a good news for the kklmmt model .        for the running of the spectral index , according to the wmap five - year data",
    ", one finds an upward shift from the three - year result , @xmath151 ( wmap5 + bao + sn ) .",
    ", may indicate that there is no evidence for the running of the spectral index , as pointed out in @xcite . ] the kklmmt model , generally , can not yield a seeable running of the spectral index .",
    "however , for @xmath152 , a large running is also possible in the kklmmt model .",
    "unfortunately , even though taking a big @xmath0 , the kklmmt model can not provide a running compatible with the current wmap result for the running , see fig .",
    "[ fig : running ] . of course",
    ", the future high precision observations might make a more precise measure for the running of the spectral index , and might demonstrate explicitly that there is no running of the spectral index .",
    "furthermore , we also compare the angular power spectrum of the kklmmt model with the wmap five - year data , by employing the camb code @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ angular ] . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ angular ] , we see that the smaller the value of @xmath0 is , the larger the first peak amplitude will be , and , obviously , @xmath153 is not able to fit the power spectrum at all . thus , the current data of the cmb angular power spectrum also indicate that the parameter @xmath0 should be taken as @xmath154 , which is consistent with the constraint from the spectral index .",
    "finally , let s discuss the prospects for the future measurements of the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath8 , in light of the existing constraint on @xmath42 . from the above analysis , we know that the current constraints on @xmath42 put a bound on the kklmmt model of order @xmath155 or so .",
    "such a small value of @xmath0 leads to a negligible @xmath8 , less than @xmath156 , see fig .",
    "[ tensor1 ] .",
    "this means that if current bounds on @xmath42 do not shift appreciably , any observation of primordial tensor modes will rule out the kklmmt model entirely .",
    "therefore , the future measurements of @xmath8 might provide a disproof for the kklmmt model .",
    "in this paper , we have studied brane inflation with the wmap five - year data .",
    "we first considered a general brane inflation model in which the problem of dynamic stabilization is neglected .",
    "furthermore , we examined the kklmmt model by using the wmap five - year results .    for the general inflation model ,",
    "we show that , according to the wmap five - year data , the model survives at the level of 1@xmath41 .",
    "this conclusion is different from that of a previous work @xcite which is based on the analysis of the wmap three - year data . in @xcite , with the wmap three - year data , it was indicated that the brane inflation model for @xmath43 ( d3-brane case ) is near the boundary of the wmap3 only and can not fit the wmap3+sdss data at the level of 1@xmath41 ; the model with @xmath34 ( d5-brane case ) is outside the range allowed by wmap3 only or wmap3+sdss at the level of 1@xmath41 .",
    "therefore , we find that the wmap five - year data save the brane inflation model to the level of @xmath122 .    for the kklmmt model ,",
    "we first discuss how the various observables can bring constraints on the parameter @xmath0 of the model .",
    "then , we compare the model to the wmap five - year results . in @xcite , by using the wmap three - year data , the authors find that the kklmmt model can not fit wmap3+sdss data at the level of 1@xmath41 and a fine - tuning , at least eight parts in a thousand , is needed at the level of 2@xmath41 .",
    "however , in this work , we show that the kklmmt model is consistent with both the data of wmap5 only and of wmap5+bao+sn at the level of @xmath122 .",
    "moreover , comparing to the wmap five - year results , we find that the value of the parameter @xmath0 is relaxed to @xmath150 at the level of 2@xmath41 .",
    "therefore , the problem of fine - tuning of @xmath0 is alleviated to a certain extent when confronting the wmap five - year data .",
    "this is definitely a good news for the kklmmt model .",
    "this paper only discusses the the simplest realistic brane inflationary model , namely the kklmmt model , in which the usual slow - roll scenario is employed , but does not involve the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) scenario , in which the rolling of the inflaton is albeit slow but relativistic . in the dbi model , large tensor mode and/or non - gaussianity may emerge , providing a possible stringy signature .",
    "the dbi model has been investigated in detail in @xcite by using the wmap five - year data .",
