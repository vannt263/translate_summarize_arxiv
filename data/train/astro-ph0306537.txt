    "nearby young stellar associations offer unique advantages for detailed studies of star and planet formation ( jayawardhana & greene 2001 ) . in particular , their proximity in combination with modern adaptive optics facilitates sensitive studies of individual star systems down to physical scales of @xmath23au , closing the gap between spectroscopic and visual binaries and thereby offering the prospect of a complete census of multiplicity among young pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars down to sub - stellar masses .",
    "completeness in sampling the binary frequency is important to avoid bias in the understanding of formation and evolution of multiple star systems .",
    "several studies have shown multiplicity frequencies to be significantly higher among pms stars than their main sequence ( ms ) counterparts ( duchne 1999 ) . suggested explanations for this discrepancy include observational sample / sensitivity bias , environmental or evolutionary effects , such as disruption of binaries by close approaches of other stars ( ghez , neugebauer , & matthews 1993 ) , ejections of low - mass companions in multiple systems ( e.g. , bate et al .",
    "2002 ) , or even stellar mergers .    historically , the determination of ms binary orbits , and thus their dynamical masses , have been critical for the successful theory of stellar structure developed in the early 20th century .",
    "unfortunately , the nearest known pms stars , at a distance of @xmath2150 pc , had been until recently too far away to resolve companions with reasonably short orbital periods .",
    "resolving companions spatially is important since spectroscopic observations by themselves only yield the relative masses of binaries . by resolving a spectroscopic binary spatially down to a physical scale of a few au",
    ", it is not only possible to determine the dynamical masses of the components , but also to derive an independent distance to the system .",
    "therefore , spatially resolved pms binaries are essential tools for testing models of pms stellar structure and evolution ( palla & stahler 2001 ) .",
    "an interesting recent example is the dynamical mass determination of the ttauri binary ntt045251 + 3016 by steffen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ; using precise radial velocity and astrometric data , they show that it is now possible to derive the stellar masses without any astrophysical assumption and compare to pms evolutionary tracks .    a third important reason to search for companions of pms stars is to clear up the ambiguity when placing them on evolutionary luminosity - color diagrams .",
    "an unresolved pms binary will show a luminosity ( and possibly color ) different from the individual components , thereby biasing any conclusions drawn from evolutionary diagrams ( for an extensive review , see mathieu 1994 ) .    due to their proximity , the nearby young associations mbm12 ( luhman 2001 ) and twhydrae ( kastner et al .",
    "1997 ) are prime targets for detailed studies of circumstellar disks and close companions .",
    "jayawardhana et al .",
    "( 1999b ) conducted a census of disks among twhydrae association ( twa ) members and jayawardhana et al .",
    "( 1999a ) showed that most of the mid - infrared emitting dust in the 14 binary hen3 - 600 is associated with the primary .",
    "a similar study of mbm12 members was reported by jayawardhana et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who found that six of the eight stars observed harbored significant mid - infrared excess ; four of these disks have now also been detected in the ( sub-)millimeter ( itoh et al . 2003 ; hogerheijde et al .",
    "2003 ) . using adaptive optics ( ao ) on gemini north , jayawardhana et al .",
    "( 2002 ) resolved lkh@xmath3 263 ( mbm12 - 3 ) into a 0415 binary and imaged a companion edge - on disk 4115 away .",
    "chauvin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) reported several additional binaries in mbm12 , and macintosh et al .",
    "( 2001 ) reported a 55  mas binary in twa . in this work ,",
    "we report the results of an ao survey of the inner ( sub - arcsecond ) regions of uyaur and member stars of mbm12 and twa , in search of close companions . among the 24 stars we observed , we found six close binaries and a triple not known at the time , and confirmed four known binaries .",
    "we surveyed 24 young stars on 2000 february 2223 with the 10-m keck  ii telescope on mauna kea , hawaii , using adaptive optics ( wizinowich et al .",
    "2000 ) and the near - infrared ( nir ) camera kcam .",
    "kcam is based on a 256@xmath4256 pixel nicmos-3 hgcdte array , and was provided by the university of california as an early interim engineering grade camera .",
    "the pixel scale was measured on 2000 february 21 by macintosh et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to be @xmath5  maspixel@xmath6 . since",
    "one 128@xmath4128 quadrant of kcam is non - functional , the field of view was l - shaped with 224 per quadrant .",
    "we observed the targets by co - adding 1 to 20 exposures of integration time 0.62s to 60s each , and then moving the target to another quadrant of the array so that the target was located in each of the three working quadrants at least once .",
    "the science target itself was used as a wave front sensor for the ao system , except in the case of twa9  b , where we used twa9",
    "a. we observed through three different filters , @xmath7 ( 1.26 ) , @xmath1 ( 1.648 ) and @xmath8 ( 2.127 ) , located in a cold filter wheel .",
    "the strehl ratio during the two nights was 0.200.25 in @xmath1 .",
    "the data reduction was done in a standard way by subtracting sky frames from source frames and then dividing by a flat obtained on - sky during dusk .",
    "we also corrected for the substantial number of bad pixels .",
    "cosmic ray hits were less of a problem because the exposures were short .",
    "for a frame with the target in a given quadrant of the array , the sky frame was obtained by averaging the frames with the target in one of the other two quadrants . for binaries with separations greater than @xmath22 ,",
    "the secondary was only visible on one frame out of three , and only one frame was free from sources in the right quadrants to be used as a sky .    due to the small field of view and the variability of the ao point spread function ( psf ) , it is not possible to obtain accurate absolute photometry .",
    "relative photometry and astrometry of binary systems were measured on multiple frames , and then combined to get an estimate of the errors .",
    "we did aperture photometry with a diameter of 4 pixels , except for the close binaries in the twa5  a and s18  b systems where we used apertures with a diameter of only 2 pixels .",
    "the contamination from the companion into the aperture was estimated by placing an aperture also on the opposite side of the companion . to obtain accurate astrometry of these tight binaries we used the myopic deconvolution algorithm idac",
    "( christou et al . 1999 ) .",
    "idac estimates the psf simultaneously with the deconvolved image , but needs a series of exposures with varying psfs and/or accurate estimates of the psf . for twa5",
    "a we used 7 frames in @xmath1 , but for s18  b we had only 3 @xmath1-frames . since s18 is a triple , however , we could make use of the primary s18  a as an accurate simultaneous psf estimate .",
    "based on comparisons with jayawardhana et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and chauvin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the systematic errors in our astrometry due to array orientation uncertainties are likely to be @xmath2 @xmath9    in order to estimate our sensitivity to finding close faint companions , we measured the speckle noise from observed psfs of single stars .",
    "our approximate 5@xmath0 detection limit as a function of separation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] .",
    "among the 9 proposed members in the mbm12 association we observed , we found 5 to be binaries , all previously reported by chauvin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and one to be a new triple ( table  [ tbl-1 ] ) . to calculate the multiplicity frequency of the 12 proposed members of mbm12 ( luhman 2001 )",
    ", we assume that lkh@xmath3262 and lkh@xmath3263 are part of the same quadruple system ( jayawardhana et al .",
    "2002 ) , and count lkh@xmath3264 and mbm12 - 10 as binaries ( chauvin et al .",
    "the multiplicity frequency , defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the number of single , double , triple and quadruple systems respectively , is found to be @xmath15 , where the quoted error is statistical .",
    "similarly , the average number of companions per star system , defined as @xmath16 ( duchne 1999 ) , equals @xmath17 .    in twa we found no new companion candidates apart from the twa5  a 54mas binary , which was also found independently by macintosh et al .",
    "the corresponding multiplicity numbers for twa are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where we have counted the companions in the systems twa119 , as reported by webb et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and zuckerman et al .",
    "twa5 was assumed to be a quadruple system , including the brown dwarf twa5  b and a spectroscopic binary in twa5  a ( see [ twa5 ] ) .",
    "this only affects @xmath20 , as @xmath21 is insensitive to multiple companions .",
    "both twa and mbm12 have multiplicity numbers that are on the high side compared to those reported for other young associations ( duchne 1999 ) , though the significance of this result is low due to the small number statistics .    in table",
    "[ tbl-2 ] we give the coordinates and absolute nir fluxes for the components as inferred from 2mass .",
    "we plainly divided the unresolved 2mass flux to the stars according to our measured flux ratios .",
    "note that the epoch of the 2mass observations differ by @xmath22  years from ours , so variations in flux may introduce errors in addition to the propagated errors quoted in the table . in table",
    "[ tbl-3 ] we present stars that did not reveal close companions in our survey .",
    "s18 in mbm12 was reported to be a 0753 binary by chauvin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . in our @xmath1-band observations ,",
    "we resolve the secondary b into a tight ba / bb 63mas binary in itself ( fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] ) . note the close similarity in configuration and scale with the triple stars vwchamaeleontis ( brandeker et al .",
    "2001 ) and ttauri ( duchne , ghez & mccabe 2002 ) . in @xmath7 and @xmath22",
    "we were unable to resolve b sufficiently to measure the flux ratio accurately .",
    "if we assume the distance to mbm12 to be @xmath2275pc ( luhman 2001 ) , then the projected distance between the stars is @xmath217au . using kepler s third law and assuming a circular orbit , we get the orbital period @xmath23 , where @xmath3 is the projection factor @xmath3 = observed ( projected ) separation / real separation , and @xmath24 is the system mass of s18  ba / bb in units of @xmath25 .",
    "this corresponds to an average motion in position angle of @xmath26 , and should be readily detected within a year .",
    "similarly , the relative radial velocity amplitude is @xmath27 , which may also be measurable over the period of a few decades unless the inclination @xmath28 , the angle between the orbital plane and the plane of sky , is very small .",
    "we found twa5  a to be a tight 54mas binary , as also reported by macintosh et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . at the distance of twa , ( @xmath255pc , perryman et al .",
    "1997 ) , this corresponds to a projected separation of only 3au .",
    "the orbital period is thus @xmath29 , corresponding to an average position angle motion of @xmath30 .",
    "the radial relative velocity amplitude is @xmath31 .",
    "follow - up studies of this system have the potential to obtain an accurate dynamical mass estimate within a few years .",
    "one possible complication may be the presence of an additional _ spectroscopic binary _ in the twa5  a system , as suggested by webb et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and torres et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "our observations also reveal the brown dwarf companion twa5  b discovered by lowrance et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . with a flux ratio of @xmath2100 ( 5 mag ) and a separation of 1954 , the companion was not always ideally placed in our l - shaped array . in our @xmath8-band observations",
    "the star was close to the edge , which accounts for large estimated errors in the photometry .",
    "the astrometry , however , is excellent , and we can use this to increase the significance of the companion hypothesis , as previously argued by neuhuser et al . ( 2000 ) .",
    "weintraub et al . ( 2000 ) used the hubble space telescope to measure accurate relative astrometry on 1998 july 12 . by combining their astrometry with our measurements",
    "we conclude that the relative positions between twa5  a and twa5  b has changed by @xmath32 and @xmath33 during the 1.61yr between the epochs . the proper motion of twa5  a , as found in the tycho-2 catalog ( hg et al . 2000 ) , is @xmath34 , @xmath35",
    ". the expected position of a background object is thus excluded at @xmath36 , somewhat higher than the @xmath37 obtained by neuhuser et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and consistent with their estimated orbital motion @xmath38 of a bound system .",
    "in addition to the young stars in the nearby associations mbm12 and twa , we also observed the classical ttauri binary system uyaur in the taurus star - forming region .",
    "uyaur is unique in that it was first discovered as an optical binary in 1944 by joy & van biesbroeck ( 1944 ) with a flux ratio 0.40.5 mag in @xmath39 . by 1992 ,",
    "the companion was no longer visible in optical wavelengths and at least 5 mag fainter than the primary in @xmath40 ( 0.71 ) ( herbst , koresko , & leinert 1995 ) .",
    "the system is obviously variable , with @xmath22-band flux ratios having varied from @xmath41mag ( white & ghez 2001 ) to @xmath42mag ( leinert et al .",
    "the system was also the second detected to show a circumbinary disk ( dutrey et al .",
    "1996 ; duvert et al .",
    "1998 ; close et al . 1998 ) . our @xmath1-band observation of uyaur has a too small a field of view and is not sensitive enough to detect the circumbinary disk .",
    "we find , however , that the flux ratio in @xmath1 is significantly smaller , @xmath43 , than previous measurements , @xmath44 ( close et al .",
    "unfortunately we can not assess whether it is the primary that has dimmed or the secondary that has brightened ( or both ) .",
    "close et al .",
    "( 1998 ) derived an extinction of @xmath45mag and @xmath46mag for the primary and secondary respectively , explaining the very red color of the secondary .",
    "if the observed change in flux ratio in @xmath1 is due to a variable extinction , then the implied change in extinction is @xmath47mag , corresponding to @xmath48mag ( assuming the extinction law @xmath49 in table 1 of mathis 1990 ) . a crude estimate , using the spectral classes k7 and m0 for the primary and secondary respectively ( herbst , koresko & leinert 1995 ) , suggests that the flux ratio in @xmath40 has evolved from @xmath50 in 1996 october 24 ( close et al .",
    "1995 ) to @xmath51 in 2000 february 22 ( this work ) .",
    "the system may thus once again have become detectable as an optical binary , just as it was at the time of its discovery in 1944 .",
    "we have conducted a survey of the inner regions of nearby young star systems and measured accurate astrometry of epoch 2000 february 2223 for 8 binaries and 2 triples , as well as flux ratios .",
    "our main conclusions are :    * the multiplicity frequency and average companion number of the young associations mbm12 and twa are very high , though the significance of this result is low because of small number statistics . *",
    "the ttauri star s18 is actually a triple system , with a tight binary ( 0063 @xmath217au ) .",
    "its hierarchical configuration is very similar to vwcha and ttau .",
    "follow - up astrometric observations may constrain the mass within a few decades . *",
    "the ttauri star twa5  a is resolved into a very tight binary in itself ( 0054 @xmath23au ) .",
    "follow - up astrometric and spectroscopic observations within a few years have the potential to accurately measure the dynamical mass of individual components as well as an independent distance , thus providing an ideal system to test evolutionary models of pms stars . *",
    "the brown dwarf twa5  b is shown to be bound to twa5  a with 9@xmath0 confidence . *",
    "the classical ttauri binary star uyaur has changed its flux ratio dramatically by more than a magnitude in @xmath1 .",
