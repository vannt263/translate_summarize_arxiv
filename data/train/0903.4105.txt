    "isospin particle - hole interaction is strongly repulsive , which leads to such collective excitations in nuclei as the gamow - teller ( gt ) giant resonance .",
    "the quenching of the total strength of the gt transitions from its sum rule value has prompted theoretical studies of possible mechanisms , ranging from conventional configuration mixing to admixture of the @xmath10-hole ( @xmath10-h ) states .",
    "recent experimental studies of @xmath11 and @xmath12 reactions  @xcite have revealed that the coupling to 2-particle2-hole ( 2p-2h ) excitations is the major source of quenching of the gt strengths , while @xmath10-h coupling plays a minor role .    at fairly large momentum transfers , @xmath13 ,",
    "the spin - transverse interaction induced by one rho - meson exchange remains repulsive , while the spin - longitudinal interaction driven by one pion exchange becomes attractive .",
    "this attraction of the spin - longitudinal interaction produces pion condensation and its precursor phenomena .",
    "pion condensation  @xcite is expected to occur in neutron stars ( nss ) such as 3c58  @xcite and accelerate their cooling  @xcite .",
    "it is predicted that pion condensation does not occur in normal nuclei .",
    "however , precursor phenomena may be observed in normal nuclei if they are near the critical point of the phase transition . as possible evidence of a precursor ,",
    "enhancements of the m1 cross section in proton inelastic scattering  @xcite and of the ratio @xmath14 , the spin - longitudinal ( pionic ) response function @xmath15 to the spin - transverse ( rho - mesonic ) response function @xmath16 , in the quasielastic scattering ( qes ) region  @xcite were proposed at a momentum transfer of about @xmath17 .",
    "motivated by these predictions , many experiments involving the m1 transition and qes have been carried out .",
    "these include the measurement of the @xmath18 scattering at incident energies of about 120 to 800  mev  @xcite , and the experimental extraction of @xmath14 using complete sets of polarization transfer observables in @xmath19 scattering  @xcite and @xmath20 reactions  @xcite on various targets at intermediate energies .",
    "however , these experimental data did not show the theoretically expected enhancements .",
    "recent analysis of qes data shows pionic enhancement in the spin - longitudinal cross section representing @xmath15 , which suggests that the lack of enhancement in the value of @xmath14 is due to the rho - mesonic component  @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the pure pionic excitation of @xmath21 scattering at @xmath22 also supports such an enhancement  @xcite .",
    "the analyses of qes and pure pionic excitation data suggest that one needs to reconsider the interpretation of the m1 data .",
    "the pionic effect in the m1 cross section might be masked by the contribution from the rho - mesonic component because the m1 state is a mixture of spin - longitudinal and spin - transverse states .",
    "in addition , proton inelastic scattering , including the m1 transition , mix isoscalar and isovector contributions . with respect to this issue , the gt @xmath23 reaction , which is the isobaric analog of the m1 @xmath18 scattering , has an advantage because the @xmath24 reaction exclusively depends on the isovector contribution .",
    "thus , it is interesting to study nuclear correlation effects in this reaction by separating the cross section into pionic and rho - mesonic components , using a complete set of polarization observables .",
    "however , no complete polarization transfer measurements for the gt reaction have been reported until now .    in this paper",
    ", we present differential cross sections and complete sets of polarization observables for the @xmath0 reaction measured at @xmath25 over a range of @xmath26 to @xmath3 .",
    "this incident energy is ideal for studying gt transitions because the spin excitations are dominant in the @xmath24 reaction near 300  mev  @xcite .",
    "in addition , distortion effects are minimal around 300  mev  @xcite , thereby enabling one to extract reliable nuclear structure information such as nuclear correlation effects .",
    "the differential cross section and a complete set of polarization transfer observables are used to separate the cross section into nonspin ( @xmath27 ) , spin - longitudinal ( @xmath4 ) , and two spin - transverse ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) polarized cross sections .",
    "the spin - dependent polarized cross sections , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , are compared with distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) calculations using random phase approximation ( rpa ) response functions , in order to assess the nuclear correlation effects quantitatively .",
    "the theoretical calculations give good descriptions of all of the spin - dependent polarized cross sections .",
    "these results demonstrate the existence of pionic and rho - mesonic correlations inside nuclei .",
    "the experiment was performed using the neutron time - of - flight ( ntof ) facility  @xcite and the neutron detector / polarimeter npol3  @xcite at the research center for nuclear physics ( rcnp ) at osaka university .",
    "detailed descriptions of the ntof facility and the npol3 system can be found in refs .",

    "the high intensity polarized ion source ( hipis )  @xcite at rcnp was used to provide the proton beam .",
    "the direction of the beam polarization was reversed every 5 s in order to minimize geometrical false asymmetries that might be present in the experimental apparatus .",
    "the polarized proton beam from hipis was accelerated up to @xmath28 and 296  mev by the azimuthally varying field ( avf )  @xcite and ring  @xcite cyclotrons , respectively .",
    "the radio frequency ( rf ) of the avf cyclotron was 15.42  mhz , corresponding to a beam pulse period of 64.86  ns . in the cross section and analyzing power measurement , one out of every five beam pulses was selected prior to injection into the ring cyclotron , yielding a pulse period of 324.3  ns .",
    "this pulse selection reduced the wrap - around events of slow neutrons from preceding beam pulses . in the measurement of the polarization transfer observables ,",
    "the pulse selection was not performed , so as to achieve reasonable statistical accuracy .",
    "note that the contribution from the wrap - around events was negligibly small ( @xmath29 ) because of the kinematical selection at the npol3 system ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : effective_analyzing_power ] ) .",
    "the single - turn extraction was maintained during these measurements in order to preserve the beam polarization .",
    "two superconducting solenoid magnets ( sol1 and sol2 ) located in the injection line from the avf to ring cyclotrons were used to precess the proton spin .",
    "each magnet can rotate the direction of the polarization vector from the normal @xmath30 into the sideways @xmath31 directions .",
    "these two magnets are separated by a bending angle of @xmath32 , and thus the spin precession angle in this bending magnet is about @xmath33 for @xmath34 protons .",
    "therefore , proton beams are obtained with longitudinal ( @xmath35 ) and sideways ( @xmath31 ) polarizations at the exit of sol2 by using the sol1 and sol2 magnets , respectively .",
    "the beam polarization was continuously monitored by two sets of beam line polarimeters ( blp1 and blp2 )  @xcite after the ring cyclotron .",
    "each polarimeter consists of four conjugate - angle pairs of plastic scintillation detectors and determines the beam polarization via @xmath36 scattering in the normal ( @xmath30 ) and sideways ( @xmath31 ) directions .",
    "a self - supporting @xmath37 target with a thickness of @xmath38 was used as the hydrogen target , and the elastically scattered and recoil protons were detected in coincidence with a conjugate - angle pair of plastic scintillators .",
    "blp1 and blp2 are separated by a bending angle of @xmath39 , and thus the spin precession angle in the bending magnet is about @xmath40 for @xmath25 protons .",
    "therefore , all components ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) of the beam polarization can be simultaneously determined using blp1 and blp2 .",
    "the typical magnitude of the beam polarization was about 0.70 .",
    "the ntof facility  @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ntof ] , consists of a beam swinger magnet , a neutron spin rotation ( nsr ) magnet , and a 100  m time - of - flight ( tof ) tunnel .",
    "the proton beam bombarded a self - supporting @xmath44 ( 98.9% @xmath45 ) target with a thickness of 89  @xmath46 in the beam swinger magnet .",
    "the target energy loss was estimated to be about 270  kev by using the stopping power of carbon for 296  mev protons .",
    "neutrons from the target entered the tof tunnel and were detected using npol3 at the end of its flight path .",
    "protons downstream of the target were swept up by the beam swinger magnet and stopped by a graphite beam stop ( faraday cup ) from which the integrated beam current was measured .",
    "typical beam currents were 50 and 500  na for the cross section and polarization transfer measurements , respectively .",
    "the reaction angle was changed by repositioning the target along the beam trajectory inside the beam swinger magnet .",
    "the nsr magnet was positioned at the entrance of the tof tunnel .",
    "this magnet was used to precess the neutron polarization from the longitudinal @xmath47 to the normal @xmath48 directions , enabling the measurement of the longitudinal component of the neutron polarization with npol3 as the normal component .",

    "the last plane ( nc ) is a two - dimensional position - sensitive liquid scintillation counter with a size of @xmath55 . both hd1 and hd2 served as neutron detectors and neutron polarization analyzers for the cross section and polarization transfer measurements , respectively , and nc acted as a catcher for the particles scattered by hd1 or hd2 in the polarization transfer measurements .",
    "thin plastic scintillator planes ( cpv and cpd ) in front of hd1 and nc were used to veto and identify charged particles , respectively .",

    "a peak from @xmath56 provided a time reference for the absolute timing calibration .",
    "the overall energy resolution in full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) was about 500  kev , mainly due to the target energy loss and the beam pulse width with contributions of about 270 and 350  kev , respectively .",

    "therefore , in the next subsection , the experimental data are compared with the dwia calculations using crdw in order to investigate nuclear structure effects which could not be included in the preceding calculations , such as rpa correlations .",

    "[ fig : crdw_result1 ] , the attractive rho - meson exchange effects are seen as an enhancement of @xmath5 and @xmath6 at @xmath133 also note that the modification of the momentum transfer dependences ( due to the shape change of the response functions in @xmath229-space which is not included through the normalization ) is important for the magnitude of @xmath7 .",
    "in some theoretical studies  @xcite , the lm parameters are taken to have the momentum- and energy - transfer dependence .",

    "@xcite , and thus the results without the dipole form factors are also slightly different from those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : crdw_result1 ] .",
    "for the spin - longitudinal mode , the use of the dipole form factors enhances @xmath4 at large momentum transfers of @xmath133 , which is due to the more attractive spin - longitudinal interaction @xmath201 .",
    "however , the effect is small , and the same results can be achieved by using smaller and reasonable lm parameters of @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
    "for the spin - transverse mode , the form factor effects are very small in both @xmath5 and @xmath6 because of the insensitivity to the spin - transverse interaction @xmath202  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : crdw_result1 ] and [ fig : crdw_result2 ] , we conclude that our data support the existence of pionic and rho - mesonic correlations in nuclei at large momentum transfers .",
    "the dwia calculations including rpa correlations reproduce the experimental data for the spin - longitudinal cross section @xmath4 and give improved descriptions of the spin - transverse cross sections , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "however , the experimental values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 remain larger than the calculated values at momentum transfers of @xmath133 by factors of about 1.4 and 2.0 , respectively .",
    "the magnitudes of the observed enhancements are significantly different for @xmath5 and @xmath6 . since the spin - transverse response is common for @xmath5 and @xmath6 , medium modifications of the effective @xmath140 interaction",
    "are considered as a possible reason for the observed enhancements .",
    "such modifications have been discussed using data for the stretched state excitations in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it is reported that the experimental values of @xmath6 at large momentum transfers are increased in magnitude by a factor of about 1.5 , indicating an enhancement in the corresponding @xmath140 scattering amplitude @xmath230 .",
    "thus , a larger value of @xmath230 might be responsible for the enhancement in the experimental values of @xmath6 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fia ] ) .",
    "however , since no modification of the @xmath140 amplitude @xmath174 is observed in the stretched state excitations , the enhancement in @xmath5 can not be explained by modifications of the @xmath140 interaction .",
    "we note that medium modifications of the effective @xmath140 interaction have been also discussed in the relativistic framework  @xcite .",
    "if one takes into account the increase in @xmath230 , the enhancement of @xmath6 is reduced to 1.3 , which is almost same as that of @xmath5 .",
    "consequently the experimental values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 may be enhanced by a common mechanism , such as higher order ( e.g. , 2p-2h ) configuration mixing  @xcite . thus more comprehensive and detailed theoretical analyses are needed including effects of higher order configuration mixing and medium modifications of the effective @xmath140 interaction .",
    "we have measured differential cross sections and complete sets of polarization observables for the @xmath234 reaction at @xmath25 with momentum transfers of @xmath26 to @xmath3 in order to investigate nuclear correlation effects inside the nuclei .",

    "for all three spin - dependent @xmath7 , a significant difference in the momentum - transfer dependence and an enhancement around @xmath133 were observed when compared to calculations .",
    "the use of a local effective mass of @xmath235 improves the agreement with the data , but still underestimates the cross section at around @xmath133 .",
