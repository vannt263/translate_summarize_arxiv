    "the adhesion model adds a viscosity term to this recipe , emulating the adhesive effects of gravity , preventing shell - crossing from ever taking place .",

    "if we invert this relation , we find that the delaunay triangulation , being the dual of the voronoi diagram tells us where the matter around an eulerian location came from .",

    "looking at figure [ fig : lnstev ] , we see voids growing to compress their weaker neighbours , while their area in lagrangian space shrinks as matter flows into the walls and filaments bounding the voids ."
