    "given that neutrinos and charged leptons sit in the same electroweak doublet , and has been shown to occur in neutrino propagation , it is natural to expect that it may also show up as transitions directly involving the charged leptons themselves .",
    "indeed , this occurs in seesaw - type schemes of neutrino mass , either through neutral heavy lepton exchange  @xcite or via supersymmetric contributions  @xcite .",

    "despite the great experimental progress neutrino physics has recently undergone , the ultimate origin of neutrino mass remains one of the most well kept secrets of nature . here",
    "i will not dwell upon the various options to endow neutrinos with mass , however i will mention the main broad options .",

    "[ fig : d-5 ] ) , in contrast to the linear behavior of the charged fermion masses .",

    "a clear example is provided by models where supersymmetry is the origin of neutrino mass .",
    "a general feature of these models is that , unprotected by any symmetry , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is expected to decay inside the detector  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "more strikingly , its decay properties correlate with the neutrino mixing angles . for example , if the lsp is the lightest neutralino , it should have the same decay rate into muons and taus , since the observed atmospheric angle is close to @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "such correlations hold irrespective of which supersymmetric particle is the lightest  @xcite and constitute a smoking gun signature of this proposal that will be tested at upcoming accelerators .",
    "current neutrino oscillation data indicate the existence of two large lepton mixing angles , while quark mixing angles are all small .",
    "this is rather difficult to _ explain _ from first principles in unified schemes where quarks and leptons are related .",
    "phenomenologically , there seems to be an intriguing complementarity between quark and lepton mixing angles  @xcite .",

    "i consider a specific idea to predict neutrino masses and mixing angles : that neutrino masses arise from a common seed at some `` neutrino mass unification '' scale @xmath34  @xcite , very similar to the merging of the sm gauge coupling constants at high energies due to supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "although in its simplest form this idea is now inconsistent ( at least if cp is conserved ) with the observed value of the solar mixing angle @xmath12 , there is an alternative realization in terms of an @xmath42 flavour symmetry which is both viable and predictive  @xcite .",
    "starting from three - fold degeneracy of the neutrino masses at the seesaw scale , the model predicts maximal atmospheric angle and vanishing @xmath13 , @xmath43 although the solar angle @xmath12 is unpredicted , one expects   symmetry that also predict the solar angle , e.  g. ref .  @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath44 if cp is violated @xmath13 becomes arbitrary and the dirac phase is maximal  @xcite .",
    "one can show that lepton and slepton mixings are closely related and that there must exist at least one slepton below 200 gev , which can be produced at the lhc .",
    "the absolute majorana neutrino mass scale @xmath45 ev ensures that the model will be probed by future cosmological tests and @xmath46 searches .",
    "rates for lepton flavour violating processes @xmath47 typically lie in the range of sensitivity of coming experiments , with br@xmath48 and br@xmath49 .",
    "optical telescopes can only probe the recent epochs of the evolution of the universe , after their last scattering surface , about 400.000 yr after the primordial bang .",
    "in contrast neutrinos can probe much earlier stages in the evolution of the early universe , such as nucleosynthesis , and even earlier periods .",
    "indeed , if neutrino masses are generated at high scale , early enough in the evolution of the universe , _ a la seesaw _ , previous to the electroweak phase transition , they may provide the seed both for the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe , and the dark matter , as i now discuss .",
    "seesaw models open an attractive possibility of accounting for the observed cosmological matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe through leptogenesis  @xcite . in this picture",
    "the decays of the heavy `` right - handed '' neutrinos present in the seesaw take place before the electroweak phase transition  @xcite through diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : lep - g ] . they may also violate cp with rates smaller than the hubble expansion rate at that epoch .        under these circumstances , the lepton ( or b - l ) asymmetry thus produced gets converted , through sphaleron processes , into the observed baryon asymmetry .",
    "however , in typical supersymmetric seesaw schemes the high temperature needed for leptogenesis leads to an overproduction of gravitinos , which destroys the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) predictions .",
    "this happens in minimal supergravity models , with @xmath50 100 gev to 10 tev , where gravitinos decay during or after bbn . to prevent such",

    "one requires an upper bound on the reheat temperature @xmath51 after inflation , since the abundance of gravitinos is proportional to @xmath51 .",
    "this leads to a stringent upper bound  @xcite , which is in conflict with the temperature required for leptogenesis , @xmath52 gev  @xcite .",
    "one way to cure this conflict  @xcite is to add a small r - parity violating @xmath53 term in the superpotential , where @xmath54 are right - handed neutrino supermultiplets .",
    "one can show that in the presence of this term , the produced lepton - antilepton asymmetry can be enhanced .",
    "an alternative suggestion  @xcite was made in the context of extended so(10 ) supersymmetric seesaw schemes .",
    "it was shown in this case that leptogenesis can occur at relatively low scales , tev or so , through the decay of a new singlet , thereby avoiding the gravitino crisis .",
    "washout of the asymmetry is effectively suppressed by the absence of direct couplings of the singlet to leptons .",
    "the presence of extra chiral singlets also helps to reconcile the large lepton mixing angles with small quark mixing angles , within the framework of the successful fritzsch ansatz . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lg10 ] sizeable asymmetry can be generated just from the leptonic cp violation parameter @xmath55 that characterizes neutrino oscillations .",
    "an attractive way to generate neutrino masses as required to account for current neutrino oscillation data involves the spontaneous breaking of lepton number . due to quantum gravity effects the associated goldstone boson - the",
    "majoron - is likely to pick up a mass .",
    "if its mass lies in the kilovolt scale , the majoron can play the role of late - decaying dark matter , decaying mainly to neutrinos .",
    "however , cosmic microwave background observations place constraints  @xcite , on the majoron lifetime and mass , illustrated in fig .

    "it may be _ tested _ as it has also a sub - dominant decay to two photons leading to a mono - energetic emission line .",
    "comparison of expected photon emission rates with observations leads to model independent restrictions on the relevant parameters , illustrated in fig .",
