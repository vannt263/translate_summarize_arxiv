    "along with the disrupted sagittarius dwarf , fornax is one of the most massive satellites of the milky way .",
    "fornax shows evidence of a complicated and extended star formation history and several studies have contributed to clarify the variety of stellar populations that are present .",
    "this galaxy was one of the first to provide convincing evidence of the presence of a conspicuous amount of intermediate - age stars , probed both by the presence of luminous carbon stars and by the well populated red clump @xcite .",
    "blue luminous stars populating the upper main sequence indicate that fornax has been forming stars up to very recent times @xcite . finally , the detection of a significant number of rr lyrae stars probes the presence of an old , metal - poor component @xcite .",
    "most recently , stellar population gradients and stellar metallicities have been studied over a wide area of fornax by @xcite , confirming the presence of at least three distinct stellar components : a young population concentrated near the centre , an intermediate - age population , and an ancient population .",
    "the three components are found to be distinct from each other kinematically , chemically , and in their spatial distribution .",
    "the distance to fornax marks a reference point in the distance ladder based on secondary distance indicators .",
    "together with the carina dwarf spheroidal and the large and small magellanic clouds , fornax has been used as a benchmark to investigate possible discrepancies between different distance indicators , and to study their dependence on the properties of the underlying stellar populations ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "fornax is particularly suitable for these kind of investigations because of the contemporary presence of both old and intermediate - age / young stellar populations .",
    "the distance to fornax has been determined using a number of different indicators , and the estimates range from @xmath5 @xcite to @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite found @xmath7 based on the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) technique , and @xmath8 based on the luminosity of red horizontal branch ( hb ) stars .",
    "@xcite derived a slightly shorter distance modulus , @xmath9 , based on trgb and red clump ( rc ) methods .",
    "a larger distance modulus , @xmath6 , was obtained by @xcite using @xmath10-band imaging of rc stars .",
    "a recent analysis of a wide - area database of near - infrared data by @xcite resulted in @xmath11 from the mean magnitude of the red clump ( rc ) , and @xmath12 based on a population - corrected measurement of the trgb in the @xmath10 band .",
    "previous measurements of the distance to fornax are summarised in table  [ tab : literature ] .",
    "the consistent results from the near - infrared photometry of @xcite and the relatively large scatter of previous optical distance estimates motivated us to revise the distance to fornax by exploiting a large multi - band @xmath13 database of photometric observations of fornax .",
    "our data , covering 1/4 square degree and containing @xmath14 450.000 stars , were obtained with the wide field imager at the eso / mpg 2.2-m telescope at la silla , chile .",
    "the range of distances found in the literature are based on different data sets , each with its own filter set and photometric zero - point .",
    "therefore , measuring the distance with different methods on a single , homogeneous data set with high statistics may provide a standard case of the _ intrinsic uncertainties _ in distance determinations in stellar systems with extended star formation histories .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : sect .",
    "[ observations ] presents the observations , the reduction techniques , and the resulting colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "the different methods used to derive the distance to the fornax dwarf spheroidal are then presented and the results discussed in sect .",
    "[ trgb ] , [ hb ] , and [ rc ] .",
    "final remarks and discussion of the results are presented in sect .",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    ".fornax distance determinations [ cols=\"<,<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this paper we have presented a revision of the distance to fornax based on wide - field @xmath13 observations , and using three different distance indicators , namely the tip of the red giant branch , the horizontal branch , and the red clump .",
    "our measurements are summarised in table  [ tab : summary ] for two different values of the interstellar reddening , @xmath0 and @xmath15 , encompassing the range of values adopted in previous works . within the errors the different methods agree .",
    "the straight average of the measurements is @xmath16 for @xmath0 .",
    "it is worth discussing the individual results of each method by comparing them with previous determinations .",
    "previous measurements based on the trgb in the @xmath17 band were obtained by @xcite , who found @xmath18 , and @xcite , who found @xmath19 .",
    "the agreement with the measurement presented in this paper is fairly good , but even better if we only look at the observable , which is the magnitude of the trgb .",
    "indeed , @xcite found @xmath20 , and @xcite found @xmath21 , almost coincident with the value derived here , @xmath22 .",
    "the difference in the derived distances are entirely due to different assumptions on the absolute magnitude of the tip , the metallicity , and the reddening .",
    "previous determinations of the distance to fornax based on the hb are presented in @xcite , who found @xmath23 , and in @xcite , who found @xmath24 .",
    "both values are fully consistent with the values presented in this paper , as is the agreement of the observable , the mean level of the hb stars .",
    "@xcite found @xmath25 while the value measured in this paper is @xmath26 .",
    "note that the @xcite value refers to the red part of the hb , while the present measurement refers to the cmd region populated by rrlyrae variable stars .",
    "this value is in perfect agreement with the mean luminosity of rrlyrae stars in the fornax globular cluster # 4 determined from a different and independently calibrated data set by @xcite .",
    "finally , a previous determination of the distance to fornax based on the optical luminosity of rc stars is presented in @xcite , who finds @xmath9 based on a magnitude of the rc @xmath27 , almost coincident with the value derived here , @xmath28 .",
    "the determination presented in @xcite , @xmath29 , is also fully consistent with our measurement .",
    "it is interesting to note that the difference @xmath30 found in this paper is in good agreement with the linear fit presented in figure 4 of @xcite , obtained by adopting the rc calibration of @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the different data sets recently published show an almost perfect agreement with each other and with the results obtained in this paper . on the other side",
    ", there are still small differences between the distance moduli obtained with different methods and by different authors .",
    "the differences are mainly due to the different details in the choice of the standard candle , while there is a striking agreement between the different photometry sets .",
    "the main sources of uncertainty are ( a ) the relatively uncertain metallicity , ( b ) the still debated absolute calibration of these methods , and ( c ) the adopted reddening .",
    "it is on these open subtle calibration issues that the attention should focus to bring the different distance measurements in perfect agreement .",
    "we would like to thank the referee , d. bersier , for his useful and constructive suggestions that significantly improved the paper .",
