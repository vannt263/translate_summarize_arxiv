    "error fields ( efs ) have been and are the subject of intense study in tokamaks @xcite where relative errors as small as @xmath0 or even @xmath1 are known to affect stability , cause disruptions , and degrade confinement and plasma rotation .",
    "error fields are obviously also very important in modern transport - optimized stellarators @xcite , whose performances rely on carefully optimized 3d magnetic fields .",
    "the specially shaped coils that generate such fields are numerically optimized and , typically , are built and positioned with very high precision .",
    "in other words , errors are minimized at the construction stage .",
    "vacuum fields are then experimentally characterized by a standard technique involving an electron beam and a fluorescent rod @xcite .",
    "incidentally , it should be noted that , since this technique requires flux surfaces to exist in a vacuum , it is not applicable to devices such as tokamaks that require plasma current to generate flux surfaces .",
    "the measured surfaces are usually confirmed to be in good agreement with the desired , optimal configuration . however ,",
    "if not in agreement , a comparison of computed and measured flux surfaces can shed light on possible sources of errors .",
    "at that point one can either ( 1 ) correct the error `` at the source '' ( reposition one or more coils ) @xcite or ( 2 ) apply ef corrections by means of a separate set of dedicated coils .",
    "this latter approach is quite common in tokamaks @xcite . as for stellarators ,",
    "ef corrections were applied in lhd by means of resonant magnetic perturbation ( rmp ) coils , also deployed in other mhd studies @xcite .",
    "w7-as used `` special '' and `` control '' coils to vary the toroidal mirror term and boundary island geometry and study their effect on plasma properties @xcite , and similar uses are envisioned for the `` trim coils '' in w7-x @xcite .",
    "earlier possibilities for ef correction in w7-x were discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "stellarators are considered complicated to build .",
    "it has been suggested that their attractiveness as reactors could increase if their construction is simplified , or construction tolerance relaxed , without significantly degrading the plasma properties @xcite . at this point",
    "it is highly hypothetical , but a possible route to simplification could consist in : i ) slightly relaxing the tolerance and ii ) correcting the errors _ a posteriori _ , either by approach ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) listed above . in either approach , it is useful to experimentally quantify the displacements , tilts and , possibly , deformations of the actual coils , compared with design values .",
    "this is useful anyway , even if stricter tolerance is adopted , to confirm that the construction imperfections are indeed smaller .    as a first step in exploring such route ,",
    "we have complemented the well - established experimental technique mentioned above with metrology measurements and with a numerical method that `` inverts '' the flux surface errors into error sources such as imperfections in coils positions and tilts .",
    "the cnt stellarator , constructed in 2004 @xcite , is notable for its simple coil configuration and for having the lowest aspect ratio of any stellarator ever built @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field is generated by a system of four planar , circular coils : two interlocked ( il ) coils and two poloidal field ( pf ) coils , the latter of which form a helmholtz pair ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coil_schematic ] ) .",
    "this configuration , as designed , generates a set of toroidal nested closed flux surfaces with two field - periods .",
    "the radial profile of rotational transform [ line - through]*@xmath2 * , as well as the general shape of the flux surfaces , can be controlled by varying two main parameters : the tilt angle between the il coils and the ratio of the current in the il coils to the current in the pf coils , @xmath3 .",
    "cnt was constructed to permit three different il coil tilt angles @xmath4 : @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "these angles were chosen for their distinct [ line - through]*@xmath2 * profiles as well as for their resiliency to efs @xcite .",
    "at which poincar cross - sections are measured as described in section [ sect : flux_surf_meas].,scaledwidth=42.5% ]    error field resiliency was an especially important consideration for cnt s coil configurations due to the permissive tolerances used in the construction of the coils and the vacuum vessel . whereas present - day stellarators are typically built to tolerances on the order of @xmath8 to @xmath0 @xcite , cnt s tolerances were of order @xmath9 to @xmath8 to minimize the cost and complexity of construction .    from 2005 - 2010 ,",
    "the interlocked coils were kept in the @xmath10 configuration .",
    "the flux surfaces for this configuration were measured experimentally and found to agree very well with numerical predictions @xcite .",
    "more recently , cnt s coils were switched to the @xmath11 configuration .",
    "this configuration is predicted to have less magnetic shear than the previous one . as a result ,",
    "efs that resonate with rational surfaces within the [ line - through]*@xmath2 * profile are expected to have more significant effects on the magnetic geometry , leading to larger islands and equilibrium deformation .",
    "a detailed understanding of the magnetic geometry in cnt is a central objective of the cnt research program .",
    "it will allow for more precise alignment of diagnostics and improve the accuracy of equilibrium modeling and reconstruction .",
    "it will also assist in the design of equipment whose shaping and placement are heavily dependent on the field , such as island divertors .",

    "the flux surface geometry in cnt is measured with a standard technique involving an electron beam and a fluorescent rod @xcite .",

    "the electrons travel along a field line until they strike an obstacle , either a part of the vessel ( if an open field line ) or an aluminum rod that extends into the confining region .",
    "the aluminum rod is coated with zno : zn fluorescent powder that emits blue - green light ( 505 nm ) when struck by electrons . in cnt ,",
    "two fluorescent rods are positioned at the mid - plane of the vacuum vessel , which coincides with the toroidal cross - section at @xmath12 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coil_schematic ] ) .",
    "the rods can be rotated across this surface with an external actuation mechanism described in ref .",
    "background pressures are maintained at the base pressure of the cnt vacuum vessel ( @xmath13 torr ) to minimize collisions with neutral atoms and molecules .",
    "if a long - exposure photograph is taken of the fluorescent rods as they are scanned across the @xmath12 plane during the emission of an electron beam , the resulting image will show a cross - section of the flux surface on which the beam was emitted .",
    "certain parts of the cross - section may not appear in the image due to shadowing by the electron gun or the limited extent of the fluorescent rods .",
    "for the measurements described in this paper , a digital camera was positioned outside the vacuum vessel to face the plane of the cross - section through a fused - silica viewport .",
    "images were acquired using ten seconds of exposure time .",
    "in addition to the fluorescent glow from the rods , the images contained some regions of stray light .",
    "this was due to blackbody emission from the electron gun filament reflecting off components in the vacuum vessel .",
    "regions of stray light were eliminated manually from each image before processing .",
    "the relative positions of each pixel were determined based on the length of the rod in the image .",
    "the absolute positions of each pixel were then determined by comparing the position of the rod to the position of a fixed landmark in the chamber .",
    "the lens axis of the camera was confirmed to be within one degree of perpendicular to the @xmath12 plane through the use of a leveling tool .",
    "this uncertainty could contribute to up to 3 mm of displacement of the resulting image , as the camera was placed roughly one meter away from the cross - section .      ; ( b ) @xmath14,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    two examples of experimentally measured poincar cross - sections are shown in fig .",

    ", the beam can be seen to strike the back side of the electron gun after a finite number of toroidal transits .",
    "for example , for @xmath16 , a region exists in which the electron beam is observed to strike the electron gun after three toroidal transits , indicating the presence of a surface ( or island chain ) with [ line - through]*@xmath2 *  =  1/3 . on the other hand ,",

    "displacements of the pf coils from their design positions were measured directly using photogrammetry . in this procedure , reflective markers were affixed to all parts of the pf coils as well as the exterior of the vacuum vessel . the vessel and coils",
    "were then photographed from several different angles .",
    "the photographs were analyzed by v - stars software ( produced by geodetic systems , inc . ) , which generated a point cloud giving the relative positions of the markers in 3d space .",
    "the point cloud was then fitted to the nominal surfaces of the machine as provided by a cad file .",
    "the result was a set of displacement vectors ( fig .",
    "[ fig : photogrammetry ] ) for each marker corresponding to the displacement of its respective part of the coil from the design location .",
    "displacement vectors that deviated significantly from those of neighboring markers were viewed as erroneous and were ignored in subsequent analysis .",
    "an attempt was also made to measure the positions of the il coils using a romer six - axis measuring arm . however , limited access to the il coils restricted their measurements to a small region of each coil .",
    "the measurements obtained were sufficient to estimate the location of the center of the device to within less than 1 mm ( which was then used as a reference for the pf coil marker offsets ) , but did not yield accurate estimates of the misalignments of the il coils relative to one another .",
    "we will note that it is possible to configure the chamber to permit full access for the romer arm , but this could not be done on the time scale of the arm s availability for the measurements described in this paper and will be an objective for future work .",

    "it is noteworthy that cnt s coils still produce good flux surfaces despite having displacements of this magnitude .",
    "the observed misalignments of the pf coils are believed to have arisen during a procedure to change the il coil configuration from @xmath20 to @xmath11 .",
    "the pf coils must be tilted out of the way to permit access to the il coils , and they sit on hinged support structures for this purpose . by the end of the procedure , the structures had visibly deformed due to internal stresses arising from the tilting , likely affecting the positions of the pf coils themselves .    to determine the effects of the measured pf coil displacements on the flux surfaces ,",
    "new field line traces were conducted with the pf coils offset according to the photogrammetry data . for these calculations , the pf coils were still assumed to be circular and planar but were tilted and translated so as to best fit the displacement vectors . according to these fits , the northern ( @xmath21 ) and southern ( @xmath22 ) pf coils were translated 5 mm and 22 mm respectively , and their axes were tilted by @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .     cross - section with @xmath14 from a configuration incorporating the measured pf coil displacements ( blue ) and from the design configuration ( black ) .",

    "[ fig : pfc_disp_compare ] using @xmath14 .",
    "although the plots are not identical ( in particular , the magnetic axis has shifted slightly outboard and field lines initiated at the same locations do not overlap perfectly ) , the effects of the pf coil displacements do not appear to be sufficient to explain the observed experimental discrepancies .",
    "in particular , the slight increase in the [ line - through]*@xmath2 * profile is actually the opposite effect of what would be needed to explain the [ line - through]*@xmath2 * = 1/3 island chain seen at an intermediate minor radius in fig .",
    "[ fig : ideal_poinc_comp]b .    since the pf coil displacements were not enough to explain the observed differences in poincar cross - sections , additional sources of field error were sought",
    "in the search for additional sources of field error , the most likely candidate was thought to be displacements to the il coils .",
    "previous work @xcite has shown that a translational displacement of either of the il coils has a significantly greater effect on the magnetic geometry than the same displacement applied to either of the pf coils .",
    "( for this reason , the tolerance for the il coils was set at 2 mm , one - fifth of the pf coil tolerance . )    to identify the possible causes of the systematic offset in [ line - through]*@xmath2 * discussed in section [ sect : flux_surf_meas ] , a series of numerical field line traces was computed for different classes of il coil displacements .",

    "[ fig : diota_compare ] , it is evident that the two classes of displacements that have the greatest influence on [ line - through]*@xmath2 * are the separation of the il coils ( along the @xmath30 axis ) and the tilt angle between the il coils . another less - prominent influence arises from the separation of the pf coils .",
    "this is roughly equivalent to changing the pf coil current , as it strengthens or weakens the helmholtz field created by the coils , and illustrates how adjusting the pf current relative to the il current serves as a fine adjustment to the iota profile .    the relative sensitivity of [ line - through]*@xmath2 * to the different classes of coil displacements in fig .",
    "[ fig : diota_compare ] suggests that , if the offset of the [ line - through]*@xmath2 * profile is indeed caused by coil displacements , it is very likely that displacements of the il coils play a significant role .",
    "this observation motivated a more detailed study of il coil displacements to be described in the following section .",
    "the optimization method used in this study tweaks the coil positions in small increments until the calculated poincar data resulting from the perturbation matches with the experimentally obtained poincar cross - sections .",

    "[ fig : verification]c ) , but afterward , @xmath52 flattened out : the optimizations did not converge any further toward @xmath44 .",
    "one possible explanation is that a relatively long finite differencing interval @xmath68 was used to determine the jacobian in each step : all translational ( @xmath30 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 ) components used an interval of 1 mm , and the angular components ( @xmath94 and @xmath89 ) used an interval of 0.001 .",

    "[ fig : diota_compare ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that , while the `` co- '' translational motion of the coils may indicate that the il coils are indeed off of their nominal positions , it may also reflect misalignment of the fluorescent rod .",

    "[ fig : diota_compare ] in mind , this shift , combined with the 3 mm of counter - motion in the @xmath34 direction , is likely responsible for most of the downward offset in [ line - through]*@xmath2 * observed experimentally .    during the optimization , the value of @xmath52 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : params_exp_10free]b ) for the poincar data associated with the displacements decreased by a factor of more than 100 .",

    "the final value of @xmath52 is lower for this optimization than in the verifications ( fig .",
    "[ fig : verification]c ) by about an order of magnitude ; however , this is primarily due to the fact that the target parameters @xmath98 determined here from the experimental data have greater uncertainty than those of the manufactured solutions .",

    "[ fig : iota_unp ] ) failed to account for the presence of [ line - through]*@xmath2 * = 1/3 for @xmath105 and that , furthermore , the pf coil displacements alone were insufficient to explain this disagreement ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pfc_disp_compare ] ) .",
    "hence , the optimization of the il coil displacements has resolved the discrepancy between the observations and predictions .",
    "for the optimization conducted for the cnt il coils in this paper , the target parameters in @xmath39 came exclusively from a single current - ratio topology ( @xmath3 = 3.68 ) that had no significant magnetic islands . in principle , a cross - section containing magnetic islands should also be useable for an optimization if adequate experimental surface data are available , in the sense that many puncture points are distributed evenly around the cross - section of the surface .",
    "such data were not available from cnt cross - sections featuring prominent islands , largely as a result of two factors .",
    "the first was that cross - sections containing the large [ line - through]*@xmath2 * = 1/3 island chain were cut off at the inboard side due to the finite extent of the fluorescent rod .",
    "on the other hand , had the rod extended further inboard , it would have collided with the il coils during rotation . thus , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : opt_poinc_otherratios]b , there are no complete surfaces recorded outside the island chain .",
    "this factor may be unique to cnt as it relates to the particular coil configuration .",
    "the second factor , more likely to arise in other stellarators , is the shadowing of near - rational surfaces in the vicinity of island chains .",
    "this is a result of the electron beam striking the back side of the gun before reaching the fluorescent rod .",
    "this effect is visible in surfaces near the magnetic axis in fig .",
    "[ fig : opt_poinc_comp]a - b , in which only three dots appear , corresponding to the first three toroidal transits of the electron beam . in this case , the shadowing was not a major concern because only a small portion of the cross - section was affected .",
    "but in low - shear profiles with one or more rational surfaces at intermediate minor radii , large portions of the cross - section may be shadowed , thereby obscuring a large amount of geometric information and preventing the determination of accurate geometric parameters .",
    "however , if the above factors are absent or limited in extent , we expect that cross - sections with island chains should be useable for optimization .",
    "poincar data from field lines within a chain of large islands , identifiable by large empty intervals in the poloidal angle @xmath31 , are ignored in the parametrization procedure ( [ subsect : island - param ] ) .",
    "thus , only the closed flux surfaces on either side of the island chain will determine @xmath37 , and , in turn , the netwon steps @xmath47 in an optimization .",
    "although the information about the magnetic geometry within the islands themselves is lost , the kinking of nearby closed flux surfaces adjacent to the island chain is retained .",
    "it is hypothesized that the closed flux surfaces with island - induced kinking should be sufficient for the optimization .",
    "although the vector @xmath38 of coil parameters used for the optimization in this paper had only ten components , this vector can in principle be expanded to contain arbitrarily many parameters characterizing non - rigid displacements for multiple coils .",
    "one logical extension for cnt would be to allow for elliptical compression of the il coils , which would add two more parameters for each coil ( one for ellipticity and one for phase ) .",
    "more general deformations may be treated , for example , as fourier series in which each additional @xmath106 number would require the addition of two parameters ( coefficients ) if the coil is assumed to stay planar . with the addition of even more parameters , the coil could be allowed to deform off of its nominal plane .",
    "it follows that , for an arbitrary stellarator , the size of @xmath38 would scale as the number of coils to be optimized times the number of degrees of freedom for rotation , translation and deformation afforded to each coil . of course , as seen in the foregoing study ,",
    "each coil need not be given the same number of degrees of freedom .",
    "assuming @xmath37 consists of geometric data from only one current - ratio ( which need not be the case ) , each column of the jacobian can be computed with a single call to the field line tracer .",
    "different columns , however , corresponding to perturbations to different components of @xmath38 , require separate field line traces .",
    "since the field line traces are the most demanding part of the optimization procedure , the computation will scale linearly with the size of @xmath38",
    ". it should be noted , however , that since the columns of the jacobian may be determined in parallel with one another , the time need not scale linearly if multiple processors are available .",
    "in summary , significant vacuum field errors have been observed in the cnt stellarator with the coils configured to have @xmath107 .",
    "photogrammetric measurements of the pf coils showed misalignments , although those misalignments were not sufficient to fully explain the disagreements , in particular the observed offset in the [ line - through]*@xmath2 * profile . a numerical analysis of the influences of coil displacements on [ line - through]*@xmath2",
    "* indicate that [ line - through]*@xmath2 * is most sensitive to displacements of the il coils .",
    "this motivated the development of a numerical optimization method to calculate displacements for the il coils that , in combination with the measured pf coil displacements , fit to the observed poincar cross - sections .",
    "the application of this algorithm to cnt at @xmath103 led to a set of il coil displacements that exhibited significantly improved quantitative and qualitative agreement with observations .",
    "future work will focus on improving the optimization algorithm to achieve even better fits to the observed data .",
    "these improvements will include ( 1 ) simultaneously optimizing to data from multiple current - ratios using @xmath46 vectors that include geometric parameters for multiple poincar cross - sections , ( 2 ) operating the field line tracer at greater numerical precision to reduce the uncertainty in numerically generated fourier coefficients and allow for smaller finite difference intervals for the computation of the jacobian , ( 3 ) expanding the @xmath38 vector to include other sources of error including coil deformations , uncompensated coil leads , and displacements of the pf coils , and ( 4 ) investigating ways of generalizing the @xmath37 vector to include information about poincar data inside islands , possibly analogous to generalizations of 3d toroidal equilibria found in codes like pies @xcite , siesta @xcite , and spec @xcite .",
    "many of these improvements will be more demanding computationally , although much of the algorithm can be parallelized ( in particular , the calculation of the covariance and jacobian matrices ) .",
    "while the misalignments in the cnt coils could in principle be corrected by , for example , repairing or replacing the support structures , this is not a high priority for the cnt program .",
    "one reason for this is that , in spite of the field errors , we still have access to configurations with good sets of nested , closed flux surfaces such as the one attained for @xmath3 = 3.68 .",
    "in addition , the large island chains that the field errors have given rise to at lower current - ratios present an opportunity for research in island divertor physics .",
