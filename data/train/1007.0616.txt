    "pouring a large amount of granular material into a vertical and static cell produces two different , interesting structures depending on the geometrical boundary conditions imposed on the system . in a silo when all the side walls are closed , injection of granular material produces a static granular pack which is a vertical column with a flat and horizontal free surface .",
    "granular packs have been the subject of studies for long time  @xcite because , in addition to the practical applications like corn storages in silos , they serve as a useful model for a variety of physical systems . on the other hand , inserting grains into a cell with at least one open boundary , generates a stable heap with finite slope .",
    "this non - zero angle to the horizontal , the angle of repose @xmath3 , is one of the most important characteristic of the granular material at macroscopic scales  @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of deep granular columns is the saturation of vertical stress at the bottom of the silo known as the janssen effect , named after german engineer h.a .",
    "janssen  @xcite .",
    "janssen was one of the first who studied systematically the effect of pressure screening at the bottom plate of silos and succeeded to present a theoretical framework which accounts for this peculiar behavior of granular matter . in janssen s model",
    "the granular material is treated as a continuous medium in which a fraction @xmath0 of the vertical stress @xmath4 converts to the horizontal stress . with the further assumption that all the frictional forces exerted by the walls are at the coulomb failure criterion , he derived the following expression for the value of @xmath4 at the depth @xmath5 of a granular pack in a vertical container : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mass density of the granular material",
    ", @xmath8 is the gravitational acceleration , and @xmath9 is the decay length . the decay length ( and subsequently the saturated stress @xmath10 ) is related to the cell geometry and wall - grain interaction as well as the grain - grain interactions .",
    "janssen s theoretical analysis leads to a value of @xmath11 for decay length in which @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the area and circumference of the cell profile respectively and @xmath2 is the friction coefficient between the walls and grains ( sometimes and especially in old literature , the value of @xmath14 has been referred to as janssen s coefficient ) .",
    "recent experimental and computational studies revealed that the above formula needs to be modified , and as such , the classical janssen analysis and specifically the assumption of coulomb failure is not always satisfied . a number of modified janssen formulas ( which usually mandate a region of perfect hydrostaticity next to the surface ) have been suggested which fit the data obtained from real experiments and sophisticated simulations  @xcite better than the standard janssen s formula .",
    "however , the concept of pressure saturation at the bottom of the container is still valid .",
    "the janssen effect originates from the ability of granular materials to support shear stress .",
    "the frictional forces exerted by container s lateral walls carry part of the grains weight .",
    "these very frictional forces are also responsible for the formation and stability of a sandpile in a container with an open boundary . at the beginning ,",
    "when the injected grains fall on the bottom of the cell , the frictional forces between the grains and the cell walls dissipate the major part of the grains kinetic energy , helping the rapid formation of a sandpile .",
    "meanwhile , the presence of lateral walls modifies the angle of repose mostly because of the arching phenomena between front and rear walls  @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the case of a thin container ( usually called the granular hele - shaw cell ) many studies have demonstrated that just like the saturated normal stress , the angle of repose @xmath3 is dependent on both cell geometry ( here the cell thickness @xmath15 ) and the wall - grain friction coefficient  @xcite .",
    "courrech et al  @xcite proposed a simple model to incorporate the lateral wall effect on piling via the janssen effect .",
    "this model introduces a new characteristic length defined as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the flowing layer height when an induced surface avalanche is about to stop .",
    "the predicted growth of @xmath3 in courrech et al s model : @xmath18 is slower than the empirical exponential law  @xcite : @xmath19 which has been traditionally used to fit their data . here , @xmath20 is a constant which depends on grain properties and @xmath21 is a characteristic length representing the scale over which the walls affect the piling of grains .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in numerical evaluation of the applicability of the janssen assumptions in the case of quasi 2-d sandpiles formed by pouring granular material into thin vertical hele - shaw cells .",
    "first we show that , similar to granular packs in silos , the global pressure at the cell s bottom , @xmath22 , saturates to a limiting value while the mass is increasing .",
    "we then investigate the effect of wall - grain and grain - grain friction coefficients on @xmath22 and also global horizontal stress @xmath23 at the front and rear walls .",
    "an important issue is the dependence of the janssen coefficient @xmath0 on system parameters .",
    "we examine the effect of the friction coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath2 , as well as cell thickness @xmath15 , on the value of the janssen coefficient and observe interesting and sometimes unexpected results .",
    "our simulations are based on a distinct element method ( dem ) scheme , originally proposed by silbert et al .",
    "@xcite . for the sake of clarity",
    ", we review the most important aspects of it here . according to this model ,",
    "the spheres interact on contact through a linear spring dashpot interaction in the normal and tangential directions to their lines of centers . in a gravitational field",
    "@xmath8 , the translational and rotational motions of grain @xmath24 in a system at time @xmath25 , caused by its interactions with neighboring grains or walls , can be described by newton s second law , in terms of the total force and torque with the following equations : @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are respectively , the mass of grain _ i _ and the relative distance between grains _",

    "the rate of change of elastic tangential displacement @xmath43 , set to zero at the initial part of contact , is given by @xcite @xmath44    the second term in eq.(9 ) arises from the rigid body rotation around the contact point and insures that @xmath43 always lies in the local tangent plan of contact . in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , the normal and tangential forces acting on grain _ i _ are given by @xmath45 and @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are elastic and viscoelastic constants respectively and @xmath49 is the effective mass of spheres with masses @xmath28 and @xmath50 . the corresponding contact force on grain _ j _ is simply given by newton s third law , i.e. , @xmath51 . for spheres of equal mass @xmath52 , as is the case in our system , @xmath53 ; @xmath54 for the linear spring dashpot ( hookian ) model with viscoelastic damping between spheres @xcite .",
    "static friction is implemented by keeping track of the elastic shear displacement throughout the lifetime of a contact .",
    "the static yield criterion , characterized by a local grain friction coefficient @xmath55 , is modelled by truncating the magnitude of @xmath43 as necessary to satisfy @xmath56 .",
    "thus the contact surfaces are treated as `` sticking '' when @xmath56 , and as `` slipping '' when the yield criterion is satisfied @xcite .    in the following",
    "we present the results of our extensive molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations  @xcite in three dimensions on model systems of @xmath57 mono - disperse , cohesionless and inelastic spheres of diameter @xmath58 and mass @xmath59 .",
    "the system is constrained by a rectangular box with fixed rough walls and free top surface , as in fig1 .",
    "a simulation was started with the random generation of spheres without overlaps from top and left corner of container , followed by a gravitational settling process to form a stable heap .",
    "the results are given in non - dimensional quantities by defining the following normalization parameters : distance , time , velocity , forces , elastic constants , and stress are , respectively measured in units of _ d _ , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "all data was taken after the system had reached the steady state .",
    "because of the complexity of the model , there are a wide range of parameters that affect the results of computation .",
    "we usually investigate the effect of a single parameter varying in a certain range while other variables are fixed to their base values as listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "all the cases were simulated in three dimensions using a molecular dynamics code for granular materials lammps @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion for the translational and rotational degrees of freedom are integrated with either a third order gear predictor - corrector or velocity - verlet scheme @xcite .",
    "we start from an empty vertical cell composed of two parallel plates ( front and rear walls ) separated by an spacer with an adjustable width @xmath15 .",
    "a granular heap is formed in the cell by pouring the grains on the bottom plate .",
    "these grains are released from a small box located on the top - left of the cell ( see fig.1 and fig.2 ) where they have been randomly located in the first place .",
    "the number of grains filling the small box , depends on the material density and the size of box .",
    "the rate of material insertion @xmath65 can be varied by changing the box size .",
    "the process repeated successively .",
    "a pile with well defined shape starts to form as the number of the added grains grows .",

    "all the other parameters are as those listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "clearly , the total pile mass @xmath89 , is proportional to the number of grains in the cell .",
    "it can be seen from fig.3 that after a short initial time , both @xmath88 and @xmath82 grow linearly with @xmath90 .",
    "this is the expected behavior of a pile with constant density @xmath91 and fixed angle of repose @xmath3 .",
    "the total normal forces exerted by the front ( or rear ) wall , @xmath92 , the spacer , @xmath85 , and also the apparent weight of the grain pile , i.e. the normal force exerted by the bottom plate , @xmath84 , are all increasing functions of mass as depicted in fig.4 .",
    "further investigations of these curves suggest that while @xmath92 grows linearly with @xmath57 , both @xmath84 and @xmath85 increase linearly with @xmath90 .",
    "given the fact that except for the thickness @xmath15 the other pile linear sizes are growing as @xmath90 , one can deduce that all the global normal stresses @xmath93 ( bottom pressure ) , @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( horizontal stress ) should approach constant values after the transition period , that is when a well - defined heap has been formed ( see fig.5 ) . from the data presented in fig.5",
    "one can see that compared to @xmath23 , the value of @xmath86 is larger at the beginning of the pile formation process .",
    "in other words , in small heaps the horizontal stress in the pile is not isotropic .",
    "however , as anticipated for very large values of @xmath57 , @xmath86 eventually becomes almost equivalent to @xmath23 , as in to the case of 3-d granular columns .",
    "from the obtained values for normal stresses , we have calculated @xmath0 , the fraction of bottom pressure @xmath22 which is taken up by the front and rear walls , @xmath23 , as a function of heap mass .",
    "the results presented in fig.6 demonstrate that , starting from smaller values , the janssen coefficient @xmath0 reaches very quickly to a maximal final value during the filling process .",
    "this is in accordance with the janssen theory which assumes a constant value for @xmath0 independent of the mass of the injected material . using the evaluated values of @xmath0 in the flat region of the curve , we have estimated @xmath96 for this very case",

    "for this we need a stable network of grains in contact with each other which spreads the forces through at the medium .",
    "obviously , the frictional forces plays the central role here , as they sustain the stability of the contact networks and heap morphology .",
    "generally , the contribution of side walls , i.e. the shear stress they impose on the confined granular material depends on the strength of wall - grain frictional forces which is determined by @xmath109 , the wall - grain coefficient of friction . to examine the behavior of the system when @xmath2 changes , we performed a series of simulations on different heaps all formed in a cell of thickness @xmath83 but with different wall friction coefficient @xmath2 .",
    "all the other parameters including grain - grain friction coefficient have been fixed to the basic values listed in table[table1 ] . from the data we have calculated the variation of normal stress @xmath22 , and the behavior of the horizontal stress @xmath23 , with the grain number @xmath57 . for more clarity we have also sketched in separate sheets the values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 as a function of @xmath2 , for the maximum grain number we used in our simulations , @xmath107 ( see fig.9 and fig.10 ) .",
    "inspection of these curves shows that the wall normal stresses almost cease to change with @xmath109 when it passes the value of @xmath101 , reach to their final minimal values . in other words , for a granular material with specified grain parameters , there is an upper limit to the contribution of walls in carrying the weight of material .",
    "the case of @xmath110 is an exception .",
    "the frictional forces between the container ( and specially the friction applied by the bottom ) are too small and as such the formation of a heap with steady angle of repose needs more times ( grains ) .    from the above data we are also able to make an almost precise estimate of the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath2 by calculating the value of @xmath111 for different values of @xmath2 ( fig.11 ) . keeping track of variation of @xmath0 during the filling process",
    "we find out that the fraction of bottom pressure converted to horizontal stress is almost constant , and the variation of @xmath0 with mass always follows a trend like that of fig.6 .",
    "therefore , the estimated values for janssen coefficient , presented in fig.11 are precise even for the case of @xmath97 .",
    "this figure also suggests that @xmath0 grows with @xmath2 but the growth slows down at larger values of @xmath2 .",
    "it is believed that one of the most effective medium parameters at the microscopic level is the grain - grain friction coefficient @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we performed a series of simulations for some selected values of @xmath1 while the other parameters have been kept constant .",
    "the obtained values for wall normal stresses @xmath22 and @xmath23 in a pile consisting of at most @xmath112 grains have been presented in fig.12 and fig.13 respectively .",
    "comparison of fig.12 with fig.9 shows that increasing each of the friction coefficients ( @xmath1 or @xmath2 ) decreases @xmath22 to a parameter dependent asymptotic value .",
    "however , side - wall normal stress shows an opposite trend .",
    "as can be seen from fig.13 , @xmath23 increases with @xmath1 before it eventually saturates to a final value at larger @xmath113 .",
    "considering the fact that the plie angle of repose @xmath3 grows with both @xmath1 and @xmath2 , one can deduce that both wall - grain and grain - grain frictional forces increase the stability of the sandpile but in two different ways .",
    "increasing @xmath2 while @xmath1 is kept constant , enhances total wall frictional forces as the maximum wall friction @xmath114 ( @xmath115 can be each of the wall normal forces @xmath84 , @xmath85 , or @xmath92 ) might increase even if @xmath23 decreases . on the other hand , by increasing grain - grain friction coefficient , the horizontal normal stresses increase , as suggested by fig.13 .",
    "these also leads to the strengthening of the maximum frictional force experienced at each side walls .",
    "of particular interest is the way friction coefficients affect the behavior of the janssen coefficient . we have chosen four different values for @xmath116 and @xmath117 , and calculated the variation of @xmath0 with @xmath1 for each case .",
    "the results are summarized in a unique diagram in fig.14 . from this figure",
    "we find that putting aside the case @xmath118 , the value of @xmath0 starts to grow rather rapidly at small values of @xmath1 , to a final maximal value which is itself an increasing function of @xmath2 in all curves .",
    "our simulations also show that for the case @xmath118 the value of @xmath0 is almost insensitive to the variation of wall - particle friction coefficient .",
    "this might be assigned to the isostaticity of the granular packing when @xmath1 is too small , similar to the phenomenon observed in ref.7 .",
    "besides , the saturation of @xmath0 with @xmath1 does not show a simple trend : while the flat part of the first three curves happens to start at @xmath119 , it begins at a value of @xmath1 much smaller than @xmath2 for the fourth curve ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "this observation resembles to the results of ref.7 too , which demonstrate the force ambiguity does not follow a monotonic variation with @xmath1 .",
    "it should be noted that for a more comprehensive study of the effect of friction coefficients on @xmath0 we need to extend the range of variation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 on the logarithmic scale .",
    "but the problem is that for small values of @xmath0 a heap hardly formed .",
    "in fact , a more suitable system for such experiments is a granular pack formed in a silo instead of a granular heap . because the formation of a well defined pack is always guaranteed even if the frictional forces are not significant .     with grain number @xmath57 in a cell of thickness @xmath83 for different values of @xmath1 : @xmath110 ( @xmath98 ) ; @xmath121 ( @xmath100 ) ; @xmath108 ( @xmath102 ) ; @xmath122 ( @xmath104 ) ; @xmath123 ( @xmath106).,width=4,height=2 ]     with grain number @xmath57 in a cell of thickness @xmath83 for different values of @xmath1 : @xmath110 ( @xmath98 ) ; @xmath121 ( @xmath100 ) ; @xmath108 ( @xmath102 ) ; @xmath122 ( @xmath104 ) ; @xmath123 ( @xmath106).,width=4,height=2 ]     on grain - grain friction coefficient @xmath1 for different values of @xmath2 : @xmath124 ( @xmath98 ) ; @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) ; @xmath101 ( @xmath102);@xmath125 ( @xmath106).,width=3,height=2 ]",
    "the effect of the cell thickness @xmath15 on the stability of a confined sandpile has been the subject of both experimental and numerical studies  @xcite .",
    "careful experiments and measurements reveal that the presence of front and rear walls increases greatly the angle of repose @xmath3 as well as the maximal angle of movement @xmath126 ( the maximal angle that a granular medium can reach when carefully tilted ) .",
    "these observations show that by increasing the cell thickness , the angle of repose , @xmath127 , decreases and it eventually settles down to an asymptotic value @xmath128 when the cell thickness becomes very large compared to the size of grains .",
    "the observed phenomenon is universal and does not depend on the formation history of the pile .",
    "to investigate the effect of @xmath15 on the wall normal stresses , we conducted a series of simulations on cells with different thicknesses , where all the other system parameters ad boundary conditions are as listed in table1 .",
    "the results for @xmath22 and @xmath23 are presented in fig15 and fig.16 .",
    "these curves indicate again that normal stresses are going to saturate with mass for all the cell thickness @xmath15 but with different rates .",
    "an interesting feature is that although @xmath22 grows with cell thickness at smaller values of @xmath15 , but the grows stops when @xmath15 becomes large compared to a single grain size .",
    "meanwhile , the behavior of normal stresses at lateral walls is different .",
    "in fact the values of @xmath23 and @xmath86 ( not shown ) decrease with @xmath15 at smaller cell thickness but again it seems both of them become almost @xmath15 independent when @xmath15 is large enough .",
    "these behaviors are very similar to the variation of @xmath3 with @xmath15  @xcite . in both cases there",
    "seems to be a transition from quasi two dimensional systems when the cell is just few grain diameters across , to three dimensional case where the thickness of the container is much greater than a single grain size .",
    "let us consider now the behavior of @xmath0 , the the fraction of bottom stress @xmath22 which is redirected to each of the side walls , with the cell thickness grows to higher values . in fig.17",
    "we have presented our calculation of @xmath0 and @xmath3 for cells with different @xmath15 , all of them contain @xmath129 grains .",
    "the other parameters are the basic values listed in table1 .",
    "as the figure shows , for small values of @xmath15 the major fraction of @xmath22 is converted to side - wall normal stresses making the contribution of frictional forces more pronounced at these small scales .",
    "however when the spacing between front and rear walls become large , compared with the size of constituent grains , @xmath0 and consequently the normal stress exerted by front or rear wall approaches constant values .",
    "in fact , the behavior of @xmath0 is very similar to the way @xmath3 varies with @xmath15 .",
    "this is a new concept and should be considered in physical modelling of wall effects on the angle of repose of confined heaps ( as well as angle of movement ) , especially when the spacing between front and rear walls is of the order of few grain diameters .     with grain number @xmath57 for various cell thickness",

    "the same behavior has been observed for front or rear wall s normal stresses and the vertical slab supporting the pile . increasing the size of the container we witnessed the saturation effects again but at larger number of grains .",

    "meanwhile , we saw that the mechanisms of the observed reduction in apparent weight while a friction coefficient is increasing , depends on which of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is subject to change . while the results of simulations show that by increasing wall - grain friction coefficient @xmath2 , the horizontal stress @xmath23 approaches smaller values , the changes are such that the overall value of @xmath114 which is the maximum of wall friction becomes larger and as such a stable heap with greater @xmath3 forms . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath2 is fixed and @xmath1 grows , we saw an increase in the calculated values of @xmath23 , which means the wall friction limit @xmath114 , is again growing with @xmath1 .",
