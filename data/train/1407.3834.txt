    "these mechanisms quench star formation by heating up gas in the galaxy ( halo ) , stabilizing it against collapse , or ( rapidly ) using it up or expelling it from the galaxy .",
    "these quenching mechanisms can be classified broadly into two modes : fast and slow .",
    "the slow mode occurs when star formation gradually fades , probably due to simple gas exhaustion over timescales longer than @xmath8gyr , and it does not require any special triggering event such as mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . on the other hand , rapid quenching is often identified with a triggering event associated with a merger - induced starburst and the resulting feedback ( from either the starburst or from an associated agn ) that rapidly removes or exhausts the gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this work focuses on rapidly quenching or recently quenched galaxies .",
    "( quenched ) post - starburst galaxies , also known as k+a or e+agalaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , offer a unique view into galaxy evolution because they are believed to be recently quenched starbursts rapidly transitioning from the blue cloud to the red sequence .",
    "they may contain lingering signatures of a quenching process imprinted on their spectral and structural properties .",
    "the fact that these galaxies have unusually large a - star populations but lack younger stars has been interpreted as evidence for recently quenched starbursts .    theoretically , post - starburst galaxies might be the end - product of galaxy mergers @xcite . in gas - rich model mergers , tidal torques channel gas to galaxy centers and power intense nuclear starbursts @xcite .",
    "the gas channeled to the centers may also lead to the onset of obscured nuclear agn activity @xcite . at the end of the starburst , after gas has been exhausted by the starburst itself and/or expelled by stellar feedback , the leftover gas and dust obscuring the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) are cleared out due to feedback from the agn @xcite .",
    "consequently , star formation and further black hole growth are halted .",
    "then the galaxies pass through the quenched post - starburst phase before they passively age and become `` red and dead '' .",
    "this work aims to test this hypothesis in detail .    using galaxy merger simulations ,",
    "@xcite have constrained the typical k+a life - time of merger - induced post - starbursts to be @xmath9gyr ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they find that the presence of agn makes almost no difference to the evolution of the post - merger spectrum in their simulation without diffuse dust .",
    "however , with diffuse dust , they find that including agn accretion results in a longer k+a phase with stronger balmer absorption lines than without this accretion .",
    "their interpretation of this result is that agn feedback does not itself directly shut off a starburst but rather serves to remove the leftover obscuring dust around the post - starburst population in the nucleus , thereby enhancing the balmer absorption features .",
    "consistent with the merger origin , past observational studies of morphology and kinematics of k+a galaxies in the field hint that they are merger remnants on the way to becoming early - type galaxies @xcite . as such",
    ", they display both early - type morphologies and signs of interactions @xcite .",

    "identifying the mechanisms responsible for quenching star formation in post - starbursts is still an outstanding problem after thirty years since their discovery .",
    "the rest of this section highlights special problems that plague post - starburst studies and have consequently hampered progress in understanding feedback in these systems .",
    "a brief discussion of how these problems are addressed in this paper is also presented .",
    "the key novel feature of this work is that it broadens the definition of post - starburst using multi - wavelength galaxy colors and spectral indices and thereby identifies agn in post - starbursts more completely and consistently .",
    "post - starbursts are rare galaxies , especially at low red - shift @xcite .",
    "they comprise @xmath11% of all galaxies at @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these galaxies tend to evolve through regions of parameter space populated by normal galaxies .",
    "for these two reasons , post - starbursts are hard to distinguish from the underlying , slowly quenching normal galaxies . because of",
    "this difficulty , the conventional definition of post - starburst is restricted to quenched post - starbursts with weak or no emission lines .",
    "the problem is that this definition excludes any transiting ( quenching ) post - starbursts with on - going star formation or strong agn activity , which may be a key link between starbursts and the quenched post - starbursts .    in this work ,",
    "we strive to directly link starbursts and post - starbursts by using a variety of novel yet plausible criteria to identify a more complete sample of objects that are in transit between the starburst phase and the fully quenched post - starburst phase .",
    "@xcite traced the evolution of local bulge - dominated galaxies during the first 600 myr after a starburst using principle component analysis of stellar continuum indices around the 4000  break .",
    "our work is complementary to @xcite in some of its main results but it is quite different in its overall methodology and analysis .",
    "for instance , we take a multi - wavelength approach : while we use stellar continuum indices to define some post - starbursts , we also apply additional constraints , such as the dust - corrected global near - uv to optical colors or near - uv to mid - ir colors .",
    "the continuum indices are sdss values measured in a 3  aperture and may not be representative of a galaxy as a whole . they are also not sufficient to identify heavily dust - obscured post - starbursts , which happen to overlap with normal galaxies in their spectral indices . to identify such objects",
    "we find that mid - ir colors are useful augmentation .",
    "finally , one of the methods used in this work is to identify common members of the starburst sequence in a narrow mass slice around @xmath13 .",
    "this value corresponds to the transition mass in the color - mass diagram where both star - forming and quiescent galaxies are presently observed @xcite .",
    "a narrow mass window approximately captures galaxies on the starburst evolutionary sequence because the quenching timescale ( @xmath14 1",
    "gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is much faster than the merging timescale ( a typical local galaxy has a major merger rate of @xmath15gyr@xmath16 @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the precursors of post - starbursts are unlikely to grow in mass via multiple mergers in the time it takes them to quench .",
    "the burst fraction ( amount of new stars formed ) in a merger is typically @xmath17% of the total mass @xcite .",
    "hence , it also does not significantly contribute to the mass increase on the starburst sequence .    even though a galaxy can be linked to its immediate progenitors by its mass , mass by itself",
    "is not a sufficient predictor of galaxy properties .",
    "recent studies show that structural parameters that combine mass and radius ( i.e. , stellar mass surface density , @xmath18 or velocity dispersion , @xmath19 ) are better tracers of galaxy quenching @xcite . this work will examine whether @xmath18 and @xmath19 of starbursts and post - starbursts are indicative of quenching in these galaxies .",
    "most previous studies on post - starburst galaxies excluded strong agn because they adopted a restrictive definition of post - starbursts as galaxies with weak or no emission lines . @xcite attempted to improve this by defining post - starbursts using spectral indices only , bypassing the need for ( weak ) emission line requirements .",
    "however , heavily dust - obscured post - starbursts and broad - line agn are still excluded or missing from their sample . this work attempts to include dust - obscured post - starbursts as part of the starburst sequence .",
    "it also constrains the star formation rates of broad - line agn and investigates whether they are preferential to a specific stage in the merger sequence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we use galex and wise photometery in our selection criteria of obscured post - starbursts , and we use the wise @xmath20 luminosity as a proxy for star formation rates ( upper limits ) of broad - line agn . in a follow up paper",
    ", we plan to do further study on the star formation rates of broad - line agn using far - infrared data .",
    "past studies of quenched post - starburst galaxies hint that agn are more common in these galaxies than in normal galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , these past studies were explicitly biased against strong agn ( seyferts ) since they excluded emission - line galaxies from their post - starburst samples .",
    "these studies also can not exclude the possibility that the weak agn signatures in their post - starbursts are from `` liner - like '' emission unrelated to agn activity @xcite .",
    "regardless , @xcite have found that 95% of their k+a galaxies have liner - like line ratios . using a sample of 44 k+a galaxies at @xmath21 , @xcite",
    "have found a higher fraction of x - ray sources in post - starbursts ( @xmath22 ) than in normal red - sequence galaxies @xmath23 ) .",
    "these sources are mostly low luminosity agn at best and have a hard mean stacked x - ray spectrum suggesting moderate levels of obscured agn activity in the bulk of this population .",
    "similarly , @xcite have found that a third ( 8/24 ) of their k+a galaxies at @xmath24 are x - ray sources with luminosities of @xmath25 ergs@xmath16 .    to improve on these previously incomplete estimates of the agn fraction in post - starbursts",
    ", we assemble a large and less biased sample of post - starbursts which includes emission - line galaxies to robustly identify agn .",
    "this enables us to estimate the agn fraction in transiting post - starbursts for the first time .",
    "we will infer the relationship between agn and recent quenching in post - starbursts from the agn fraction , and the time interval between the peak of starburst to the peak of agn activity .",
    "if the agn fraction is low , it indicates that agn and quenching of starbursts are likely not related .",
    "a significant agn delay might indicate a non - causal or secondary relationship ( e.g. , a common fueling mechanism or later additional quenching ) between starbursts and agn even if agn are more common in post - starbursts than in normal galaxies .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the multi - wavelength data .",
    "section 3 presents the sample selection .",
    "starbursts and the different classes of post - starbursts are defined in this section .",
    "section 4 investigates the agn properties of post - starbursts .",
    "section 5 presents the bulge properties of post - starbursts as an independent check on our sample selection .",
    "section 6 presents a discussion on the importance of post - starbursts in the build - up of the red sequence .",
    "this section also summarizes the main results of the paper . throughout the paper",
    ", an @xmath26 cosmology is used .",
    "all magnitudes and colors are on the ab system unless indicated otherwise .",
    "in the first three subsections , we will briefly describe the sdss , galex and wise data used . in the later subsections , we will describe the dust correction , galaxy structural parameters and stellar population modeling employed in the following sections .      the sloan digital sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sdss ) is a large photometric and spectroscopic survey .",
    "it has mapped out about a third of the celestial sphere with its five filter band - passes , @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the parent sample (  3.1 ) used in this paper comes from sdss data release 8 ( dr8 , * ? ? ?",
    "the sdss dr8 has more value - added quantities essential for the paper .",
    "as described in @xcite , dr8 includes various galaxy physical parameters such as stellar masses .",
    "briefly , the stellar masses are estimated from @xmath27 photometery using the bayesian methodology to calculate the likelihood of each model star formation history ( sfh ) given the data @xcite .",
    "the mass estimate assumes that the sfh is approximated by a sum of discrete bursts and uses templates over a wide range in age and metallicity .",
    "thus , there should be no concern over systematic differences between the stellar mass estimates of starbursts , post - starbursts and normal galaxies .",
    "in addition , the masses of these galaxies are dominated by their old pre - burst stellar populations as the contribution to the total mass from newly formed stars in a burst is only @xmath28% of the total mass @xcite .",
    "dr8 also provides spectral indices and emission line measurements @xcite . to measure the nebular emission lines of a galaxy ,",
    "the continuum is modeled as a non - negative linear combination of single stellar population ( ssp ) template spectra generated using the @xcite ( hereafter bc03 ) population synthesis code , and the best fitting model is subtracted from the galaxy spectrum .",
    "we use uv data from the galaxy evolution explorer ( galex , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to to exploit the greater sensitivity of its near - uv ( @xmath29 ) band to recent star formation .",
    "the near - uv ( 1771 - 2831  ) imaging data have a spatial resolution of 6 - 8 and 1  astrometry .",
    "the data come from the cross - matched catalog between galex gr6 against sdss dr7 .",
    "this catalog is available through the galex casjobs interface . at fainter uv magnitudes ,",
    "galex loses red galaxies because they drop below the galex detection threshold .",
    "about 82% ( @xmath30 220,000 ) of galaxies in sdss spectroscopic sample ( @xmath31 ) , in the redshift of interest for this work ( @xmath32 ) , have a galex counterpart within @xmath33 . adopting brighter r - band limit gives higher completeness ( @xmath34 ) but excludes significantly more post - starbursts ( see @xcite for a discussion of galex completeness relative to sdss ) .",
    "since post - starbursts ( including dust - obscured ones ) are mainly in the blue cloud and green valley , the galex incompletenss is less likely to affect our results significantly .",
    "furthermore , about 10% of the post - starburst galaxies have multiple galex matches within @xmath33 .",
    "although the galex photometery for post - starbursts with multiple matches may not be accurate , we do not exclude them lest we systematically exclude merging systems .",
    "about 90% of these post - starbursts are significantly dust obscured compared to normal galaxies .",
    "the exclusion of these post - starbursts does not significantly alter any of our main results .      the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) performed an all - sky survey with photometery in the @xmath35 m , @xmath36 m , @xmath37 m , and @xmath38 m bands .",
    "we used the infrared science archive ( irsa ) to match sdss galaxies with the closest wise sources within a 5  radius .",
    "about 99 ( 92)% of sdss galaxies with 5(2 ) galex matches have corresponding matches in wise .",
    "we use wise data to study obscured star formation and agn properties of post - starburst galaxies .",
    "the main purpose of the dust correction is to reduce the number of dusty obscured emission - line galaxies , which otherwise masquerade as post - starbursts .",
    "we use the balmer decrements , @xmath39 , with the physically motivated two - component dust attenuation model of @xcite to correct for attenuation of the nebular emission lines by dust . in the two - component model ,",
    "the diffuse dust accounts for 40% of the optical depth at 5500  while the denser birth - cloud dust accounts for the other 60% @xcite .",
    "the optical depth of the dust is assumed to be a power - law of the form @xmath40 for the diffuse dust and @xmath41 for the birth - cloud dust .",
    "we adopt this model because it has a physical basis and is broadly consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "in addition , we correct the continuum fluxes ( i.e. , integrated magnitudes ) using the empirical relationship between the emission line and continuum optical depths found in @xcite and their empirical stellar attenuation curve . they found that balmer emission lines experience two to four times more attenuation than the continuum at 5500 .",
    "we apply the dust correction only on galaxies whose @xmath42 and @xmath43 lines are well measured ( with signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xmath44 ) .",
    "galaxies with undetected or low signal - to - noise balmer emission lines are not dust - corrected and their observed quantities are used as the intrinsic ones .",
    "we assume the dust - free case b recombination ratio of @xmath45 for @xmath46 regions @xcite and @xmath47 for type slowromancap2@ agn @xcite .",
    "the balmer decrements are measured within the 3  fiber and do not reflect the galaxy - wide values , as there are dust gradients across galaxies @xcite .",
    "we make an approximate correction for this effect following @xcite .",
    "we also correct for galactic extinction of optical fluxes using the catalog values provided in sdss dr8 and of the nuv fluxes assuming a ratio @xmath48 @xcite , where @xmath49 is the nuv galactic extinction and @xmath50 is the @xmath51 color excess .",
    "more details on the dust correction can be found in appendix  [ sec : appa ] , where it is shown that our post - starburst selection does not significantly depend on the detailed assumptions of the dust correction described above .",
    "for instance , using single foreground screen model for dust distribution @xcite , we recover 85% of psbs selected using the two - component dust attenuation model .",
    "however , the single - component model identifies @xmath52 more psb candidates , which may also be dusty contaminants . throughout the paper ,",
    "the subscript ` @xmath53 ' on a given quantity denotes dust - correction . for example",
    ", @xmath54 denotes a dust - corrected @xmath42 equivalent width ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "in addition to the dust correction , all galaxy magnitudes and colors used in this work are k - corrected to @xmath56 using the public @xmath57 idl code @xcite . the galex nuv magnitude and the five sdss @xmath27 magnitudes",

    "@xcite found that @xmath18 is inversely proportional to the consumption time of the accreted gas from a galaxy halo ( i.e , the burst decline time ) .",
    "they suggested that a high stellar surface mass density may be connected to bulge formation through a nuclear starburst and quenching of star formation .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the mass surface densities as defined above may exaggerate structural differences between blue and red galaxies because they use a light - profile based radius as opposed to mass - profile based radius .",
    "we use @xmath18 as defined above only to show that starbursts and post - starbursts are both bulge - dominated galaxies , unlike most normal star - forming galaxies .",

    "to do so , we model sfhs of a post - starburst as a superposition of an old stellar population initially starting to form at time @xmath74 and following a delayed exponential sfh of the form @xmath75 with e - folding time @xmath76 gyr ( cf . * ? ? ?",

    "if we conservatively assume that @xmath180 of the red - sequence galaxies in the parent sample ( over the past 10 gyr ) descended from post - starbursts , we can constrain the transit time across green valley for slowly quenching galaxies . excluding the @xmath181 galaxies that might have descended from psbs , about 16,300 out of the total of @xmath172 red - sequence galaxies must have gone through the slow mode of quenching over the past 10 billion years . assuming a constant transit time across the green valley @xcite , the fact that we currently observe @xmath170 slowly fading normal galaxies in green valley implies that the transit time through gv for the slow track is @xmath182gyr .",

    "only about 3 % of 200 randomly selected normal star - forming galaxies show merger signatures . likewise , according to the galaxy zoo classification @xcite , which rather tend to be conservative in calling something a merger , about 10% of the starbursts have a weighted merger fraction @xmath186 while only 1% of normal star - forming galaxies have a weighted merger fraction above this value .",

    "we classify about 15% of tpsbs as as merging or disturbed galaxies and 6% have @xmath186 .",
    "perhaps the merger signature are washed out because of the substantial time lag between the starburst and the psb ( agn ) phases .",

    "the fact that starbursts and post - starbursts evolve through a heavily dust - obscured phase which also seems to coincide with agn activity , is consistent with later removal of dust by agn feedback .",

    "since the truncation of the starburst is abrupt , post - starburst galaxies should still carry the imprint of their merger origin by having flatter or more positive color gradients than normal star - forming galaxies .    figure  [ fig : cgrad]a shows the color gradient , @xmath68 , versus @xmath112 color while figure  [ fig : cgrad]b plots dust - corrected @xmath87 and @xmath235 diagram color - coded by the color gradient .",
    "starbursts and their descendants ( transiting and quenched post - starbursts ) have much shallower color gradients than the bulk of normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "as expected , red quiescent galaxies have flat color gradients and are red throughout but blue galaxies show an interesting regularity in their color gradients : blue galaxies with bluer in @xmath112 color ( or lower @xmath90 ) have negative color gradients ( i.e , show large reddening in their centers ) while blue galaxies with redder @xmath112 colors ( or higher @xmath90 ) have flat color gradients . in other words ,",
    "galaxies with red centers have most of their star formation in their outer blue disks and have small quiescent bulges .",
    "on the other hand , galaxies which are blue throughout are either experiencing nuclear bursts ( have star formation rates above the average ) or their nuclear bursts are abruptly terminated ( have redder @xmath87 colors ) .",
    "they have young bulges .",
    "the fact that both starbursts and post - starbursts have flat color gradients ( young blue bulges ) suggests that star formation is uniformly distributed throughout these galaxies , remaining so even as the burst quenches throughout the galaxy .",
    "it also suggests that the centers of these galaxies must have been unreddened from the typical red centers of disk galaxies , perhaps by gas inflow during a merger .",
    "likewise , the flat color gradients of obscured post - starbursts suggests that the dust - obscuration in these objects is likely a galaxy wide phenomenon .",
    "previous studies have also shown that a stars in k+a galaxies are widespread and are not confined to their nuclear regions @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : o3han2 ] depicts the distribution of dust - corrected ( @xmath136/[o\\,\\small{\\expandafter\\@slowromancap\\romannumeral 2@}]}$])@xmath263 ratios for normal star - forming galaxies , starbursts and post - starbursts .",
    "this ratio is a very reliable metallicity diagnostic and it is not very sensitive to the ionization level @xcite .",
    "panel a compares the ( @xmath136/[o\\,\\small{\\expandafter\\@slowromancap\\romannumeral 2@}]}$])@xmath263 ratios of transiting psbs with those of quenched psbs and starbursts .",
    "the ( @xmath136/[o\\,\\small{\\expandafter\\@slowromancap\\romannumeral 2@}]}$])@xmath263 ratio increases as the starbursts progressively evolve to the transiting and quenched post - starbursts .",
    "the starbursts have @xmath264/[o\\,\\small{\\expandafter\\@slowromancap\\romannumeral 2@}]}$})_\\mathrm{dc}$ ] ratios that correspond to @xmath265 solar metallicity range @xcite while the qpsbs have ratios corresponding to @xmath266 solar metallicity , although their ( @xmath136/[o\\,\\small{\\expandafter\\@slowromancap\\romannumeral 2@}]}$])@xmath263 ratio might not be well measured because their emission lines are weak .",
    "the tpsbs have intermediate metallicity between starbursts and qpsbs .",
    "k - s test indicates that the distributions of metallicity of starbursts and tpsbs are significantly different ( @xmath267 , i.e , @xmath145 ) and so are the distributions of tpsbs and qpsbs ( @xmath268 , i.e , @xmath145 ) .",
    "furthermore , panel b shows that starbursts which are younger than the median age ( @xmath269 ) have even lower metallicity than the agn hosts in tpsbs ( cf .",
    "* ) and normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "k - s test also indicates that the distributions of metallicity of younger starbursts ( or all sbs ) are significantly different ( at @xmath145 level ) from agn in tpsbs or normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "the transiently lower metallicity of younger starbursts is consistent with metal poor gas inflows during merger - induced starbursts @xcite while the higher metallicity in post - starburst agn is consistent with time delay between agn and starbursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
