    "in addition , the dependence of the energies on the aspect ratio was investigated for selected cases .",
    "while the role of the aspect ratio is negligible in the weakly - interacting regimes , its role becomes more important in the strongly - interacting regime , possibly indicating that vitual excitations of transverse modes become relevant .",
    "the full 3d energy curves with @xmath77 are reproduced to a good approximation by effective atomic and molecular 1d models whose effective interactions are given by simple analytical expressions that depend on the atom - atom @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath2 , the aspect ratio @xmath25 and the atom mass @xmath18 .",
    "we find that the energies obtained from these effective atomic and molecular 1d hamiltonian join fairly smoothly in the strongly - interacting regime .",
    "assuming that the effective 1d atom - dimer and dimer - dimer scattering lengths govern the behavior of the highly - elongated system , we deduced the positions of confinement - induced atom - dimer and dimer - dimer resonances from our energies . whether the effective 1d models also connect fairly smoothly for larger systems is a pressing questions , in particular since the determination of the phase diagram of highly - elongated systems often times relies on strictly 1d treatments .    in the future",
    ", it will be interesting to extend the studies presented here to larger population - balanced and population - imbalanced two - component fermi gases .",
    "while some microscopic calculations exist for strictly 1d systems , microscopic 3d treatments that accurately account for the dynamics along the tight and loose confining directions are challenging .",
    "furthermore , it will be interesting to compare the 1d results obtained here for small systems with those obtained within the local density approximation and to extend analogous comparisons to larger systems .",
