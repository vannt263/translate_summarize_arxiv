    "for complex compressible flows involving multiphysics phenomenons like e.g.  high - speed elastoplasticity , multimaterial interaction , plasma , gas - particles etc . , a lagrangian description of the flow is generally preferred . to achieve robustness , some spatial remapping on a regular mesh may be added .",
    "a particular case is the family of the so - called lagrange+remap schemes @xcite , also referred to as remapped lagrange solvers that apply a remap step on a reference ( eulerian ) mesh after each lagrangian time advance .",
    "legacy codes implementing remapped lagrange solvers usually define thermodynamical variables at cell centres and velocity at cell nodes ( see figure  [ fig:1 ] ) .        in poncet et al .",
    "@xcite , we have achieved a multicore node - based performance analysis of a reference lagrange - remap hydrodynamics solver used in industry . by analyzing each kernel of the whole algorithm , using roofline - type models @xcite on one side and refined execution cache memory ( ecm ) models @xcite , @xcite on the other side ,",
    "we have been able not only to quantitatively predict the performance of the whole algorithm  with relative errors in the single digit range  but also to identify a set of features that limit the whole performance .",
    "this can be roughly summarized into three points :    1 .   for typical mesh sizes of real applications ,",
    "spatially staggered variables involve a rather big amount of communication to / from cpu caches and memory with low arithmetic intensity , thus lowering the whole performance ; 2 .",
    "usual alternating direction ( ad ) strategies ( see the appendix in  @xcite ) or ad remapping procedures also generate too much communication with a loss of cpu occupancy .",
    "3 .   for multimaterial flows using vof - based interface reconstruction methods",
    ", there is a strong loss of performance due to some array indirections and noncoalescent data in memory .",
    "vectorization of such algorithms is also not trivial .    from these observations and as a result of the analysis",
    ", we decided to `` rethink '' lagrange - remap schemes , with possibly modifying some aspects of the solver in order to improve node - based performance of the hydrocode solver .",
    "we have looked for alternative formulations that reduce communication and improve both arithmetic intensity and simd ( single instruction ",
    "multiple data ) property of the algorithm . in this paper",
    ", we describe the process of redesign of lagrange - remap schemes leading to higher performance solvers .",
    "actually , this redesign methodology also gave us ideas of innovative eulerian solvers .",
    "the emerging methods , named lagrange - flux schemes , appear to be promising in the extended computational fluid dynamics community .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ] ,",
    "we first formulate the requirements for the design of better lagrange - remap schemes . in section  [ sec:3lag ]",
    "we give a description of the lagrange step and formulate it under a finite volume form . in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we focus on the remap step which is reformulated as a finite volume scheme with pure convective fluxes .",
    "this interpretation is applied in section  [ sec:4 ] to build the so - called lagrange - flux schemes .",
    "we also discuss the important issue of achieving second order accuracy ( in both space and time ) . in section  [ sec:5 ]",
    "we comment the possible extension to multimaterial flow with the use of low - diffusive and accurate interface - capturing methods .",
    "we will close the paper by some concluding remarks , work in progress and perspectives .",
    "starting from `` legacy '' lagrange - remap solvers and related observed performance measurements , we want to improve the performance of these solvers by modifying some of the features of them but under some constraints and requirements :    1 .   a lagrangian solver ( or description ) must be used ( allowing for multiphysics coupling ) .",
    "2 .   to reduce communication , we prefer using collocated cell - centered variables rather than a staggered scheme .",
    "3 .   to reduce communication , we prefer using a direct multidimensional remap solver rather than splitted alternating direction projections",
    "the method can be simply extended to second - order accuracy ( in space and time ) .",
    "the solver must be able to be naturally extended to multimaterial flows .    before going further ,",
    "let us comment the above requirements .",
    "the second requirement should imply the use of a cell - centered lagrange solver .",
    "fairly recently , desprs and mazeran in @xcite and maire and et al .",
    "@xcite ( with high - order extension in  @xcite ) have proposed pure cell - centered lagrangian solvers based on the reconstruction of nodal velocities . in our study , we will examine if it is possible to use approximate and simpler lagrangian solvers in the lagrange+remap context , in particular for the sake of performance .",
    "the fourth assertion requires a full multidimensional remapping step , probably taking into account geometric elements ( deformation of cells and edges ) if we want to ensure high - order accuracy remapping . to summarize , our requirements are somewhat contradictory , and we have to find a good compromise between some simplifications - approximations and a loss of accuracy ( or properties ) of the numerical solver .",
    "as example , let us consider the compressible euler equations for two - dimensional problems . denoting @xmath0 @xmath1 ,  @xmath2 and",
    "@xmath3 the density , velocity , pressure and specific total energy respectively , the mass , momentum and energy conservation equations read @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . for the sake of simplicity , we will use a perfect gas equation of state @xmath10 , @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "the speed of sound @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 .",
    "for any volume @xmath14 that moves with the fluid , from the reynolds transport theorem we have @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the normal unit vector exterior to @xmath17 .",
    "this leads to a natural explicit finite volume scheme in the form @xmath18 & & \\phantom{aaaaa } - \\delta t^n \\sum_{a^{n+{\\frac{1}{2}},l}\\subset \\partial k^{n+{\\frac{1}{2}},l } } |a^{n+{\\frac{1}{2}},l}|\\ , { \\bm{\\pi}}_a^{n+{\\frac{1}{2}},l}\\cdot \\nu_a^{n+{\\frac{1}{2}},l}. \\label{eq:2 } \\ ] ] in  , the superscript `` l '' indicates the lagrange evolution of the quantity . any eulerian cell",
    "@xmath19 is deformed into the lagrangian volume @xmath20 at time @xmath21 , and into the lagrangian volume @xmath22 at time @xmath23 .",
    "the pressure flux terms through the edges @xmath24 are evaluated at time @xmath21 in order to get second - order accuracy in time .",
    "of course , that means that we need a predictor step for the velocity field @xmath25 at time @xmath21 ( not written here for simplicity ) .    [ [ notations . ] ] notations .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + +    to simplify , in all what follows we will use the notation @xmath26 .",
    "the remapping step considers the remapping the fields @xmath27 defined at cell centers @xmath22 on the initial ( reference ) eulerian mesh with cells @xmath19 .",
    "let us denote @xmath28 a linear operator that reconstructs piecewise polynomial functions from a discrete field @xmath29 defined at cell centers of the lagrangian mesh @xmath30 at time @xmath23 .",
    "the remapping process consists in projecting the reconstructed field on piecewise - constant function on the eulerian mesh , according to the intergral formula @xmath31 practically , they are many ways to consider the projection operation  .",
    "one can assemble elementary projection contributions by computing the volume intersections between the reference mesh and the deformed mesh .",
    "but this procedure requires the computation of all the geometrical elements .",
    "moreover , the projection needs local tests of projection with conditional branching ( think about the very different cases of a compression and expansion ) . thus the procedure is not simd and potentially leads to a loss of performance .",
    "the incremental remapping can also be interpreted as a transport / advection algorithm , as emphasized by dukowicz and baumgardner  @xcite that appears to be better suited for simd treatments .",
    "let us now write a different original formulation of the remapping step .",
    "in this step , there is no time evolution of any quantity , and in some sense we have @xmath32 , that we write @xmath33 we decide to split up this equation into two substeps :    *  backward convection : @xmath34 *  forward convection : @xmath35    each convection problem is well - posed on the time interval @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "let us now focus into these two steps and the way to solve them .",
    "after the lagrange step , if we solve the backward convection problem   over a time interval  @xmath37 using a lagrangian description , we have @xmath38 actually , from the cell @xmath22 we go back to the original cell @xmath19 with conservation of the conservative quantities . for @xmath39 ( conservation of mass )",
    ", we have @xmath40 showing the variation of density by volume variation . for @xmath41 ,",
    "it is easy to see that both velocity and specific total energy are kept unchanged is this step : @xmath42 thus , this step is clearly computationally inexpensive .      from the discrete field @xmath43 defined on the eulerian cells",
    "@xmath19 , we then solve the forward convection problem  [ eq:5 ] over a time step  @xmath37 under an eulerian description .",
    "a standard finite volume discretization of the problem will lead to the classical time advance scheme @xmath44 for some interface values @xmath45 defined from the local neighbor values @xmath46 .",
    "we finally get the expected eulerian values @xmath47 at time @xmath23 .",
    "+ notice that from   and   we have also @xmath48 thus completely defining the remap step under the finite volume scheme form  .",
    "we find that we no more need any mesh intersection or geometric consideration to achieve the remapping process .",
    "the finite volume form   is now suitable for a straightforward vectorized simd treatment . from",
    "it is easy to achieve second - order accuracy for the remapping step by usual finite volume tools ( muscl reconstruction + second - order accurate time advance scheme for example ) .",
    "let us note that the lagrange+remap scheme is actually a conservative finite volume scheme : putting   into   gives for all @xmath49 : @xmath50 that can also be written @xmath51 we recognize in   pressure - related fluxes and convective fluxes that define the whole numerical flux .",
    "the finite volume formulation   is attractive and seems rather simple at first sight .",
    "but we should not forget that we have to compute a velocity lagrange vector field @xmath26 where the variables should be located at cell nodes to return a well - posed deformation .",
    "moreover , expression   involves geometric elements like the length of the deformed edges  @xmath52 . among the rigorous collocated lagrangian solvers ,",
    "let us mention the glace scheme by desprs - mazeran @xcite and the cell - centered eucclhyd solver by maire et al  @xcite .",
    "both are rather computationally expensive and their second - order accurate extension is not easy to achieve .    although it is possible to couple these lagrangian solvers with the flux - balanced remapping formulation , it is also of interest to think about ways to simplify or approximate the lagrange step without losing second - order accuracy .",
    "one of the difficulty in the analysis of lagrange - remap schemes is that , in some sense , space and time are coupled by the deformation process .",
    "below , we derive a formulation that leads to a clear separation between space and time , in order to simply control the order of accuracy .",
    "the idea is to make the time step tend to zero in the lagrange - remap scheme ( method of lines @xcite ) , then exhibit the instantaneous spatial numerical fluxes through the eulerian cell edges that will serve for the construction of an explicit finite volume scheme .",
    "because the method needs an approximate riemann solver in lagrangian form , we will call it a lagrange - flux scheme .",
    "from the intermediate conclusions of the discussion  [ sec:44 ] above , we would like to be free from any rather expensive collocated lagrangian solver .",
    "however , such a lagrangian solver seems necessary to correctly and accurately define the deformation velocity field @xmath53 at time @xmath21 .    in",
    "what follows , we are trying to deal with time accuracy in a different manner .",
    "let us come back to the lagrange+remap formula  .",
    "let us consider a `` small '' time step @xmath54 that fulfils the usual stability cfl condition .",
    "we have @xmath55 by making @xmath54 tend to zero , ( @xmath56 ) , we have @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , then we get a semi - discretization in space of the conservation laws .",
    "that can be seen as a particular method of lines ( @xcite ) : @xmath61 we get a classical finite volume method @xmath62 with a numerical flux @xmath63 whose components are @xmath64 in  , pressure fluxes @xmath65 and interface normal velocities @xmath66 can be computed from an approximate riemann solver in lagrangian coordinates ( for example the lagrangian hll solver , see  @xcite ) . then , the interface states @xmath67 should be computed from an upwind process according to the sign of the normal velocity @xmath68 .",
    "this is interesting because the resulting flux has similarities with the so - called advection upstream splitting method ( ausm ) flux family proposed by liou  @xcite , but the construction here is different and , in some sense , justifies the ausm splitting .    to get higher - order accuracy in space",
    ", one can use a standard muscl reconstruction + slope limiting process involving classical slope limiters like for example sweby s limiter function  @xcite : @xmath69 with @xmath70 $ ] for achieving second order accuracy . at this stage , because there is no time discretization , everything is defined on the eulerian mesh and fluxes are located at the edges of the eulerian cells .",
    "this is one originality of this scheme compared to the legacy staggered lagrange - remap scheme that has to use variables defined on the lagrangian cells .    to get high - order accuracy in time",
    ", one can then apply a standard high - order time advance scheme ( rk2 , etc . ) . for the second - order heun scheme for example",
    ", we have the following algorithm :      a hll approximate riemann solver @xcite in lagrangian coordinates can be used to easily compute interface pressure and velocity . for a local riemann problem made of a left state  @xmath88 and a right state @xmath89 , the contact pressure @xmath90 is given by the formula @xmath91 and the normal contact velocity @xmath92 by @xmath93 leading to simple formulas easily implementable in the second - order heun time integration scheme .",
    "as example , we test the lagrange - flux scheme presented in section  [ sec:4 ] on few one - dimensional shock tube problems .",

    ", we use the multithreading programming interface ` openmp ` .    in the reference",
    "staggered lagrange - remap solver ( see  @xcite ) , thermodynamic variables are defined at grid cell centers while velocity variables are defined at mesh nodes . due to this staggered discretization and the alternating direction ( ad ) remapping procedures , this solver is decomposed into nine kernels .",
    "this decomposition mechanically decreases the mean arithmetic intensity ( ai ) of the solver .    on the other hand ,",
    "the lagrange - flux algorithm consists in only two kernels with a relative high arithmetic intensity which leads to two compute - bound ( cb ) kernels . in the first kernel , named `",
    "predictionlagrangeflux ( ) ` , an appropriate riemann solver is called , face fluxes are computed and variables are updated for the prediction . the second kernel , named ` correctionlagrangeflux ( ) ` , is close in terms of algorithmic steps , since it also uses a riemann solver , computes fluxes and updates the variables for the correction part of the solver .    in order to assess the scalability and absolute performance of both schemes , we present in table  [ tab_perfs ] a performance comparison study .",
    "first , we notice that the baseline performance  e.g.  the single core absolute performance without vectorization  is quite similar for the two schemes , as can be seen in the first column .",
    "however , we the lagrange - flux scheme has a better scalability , due to both vectorization and multithreading : our lagrange - flux implementation achieves a speedup of 31.1x with 16 cores and avx vectorization ( while ideal speed - up is 64 ) whereas the reference lagrange - remap algorithm reaches a speed - up of only 14.8x .",
    "this difference is mainly due to the memory - bound kernels composing the reference lagrange - remap scheme .",
    "indeed , speedups due to avx vectorization and multithreading are not ideal for kernels with relatively low intensity since memory bandwidth is shared between cores .    [ table : multicore ]    .performance comparison between the reference lagrange - remap solver and the lagrange - flux solver in millions of cell updates per second ( mcups ) , using different machine configurations .",
    "scalability ( last column ) is computed as the speedup of the multithreaded vectorized version compared to the baseline purely sequential version .",
    "tests are performed for fine meshes , such that kernel data lies in dram memory .",
    "the lagrange - flux solver exhibits superior scalability , because it has  by design  better arithmetic intensity . [",

    "although this is not the aim and the scope of the present paper , we would like to give an outline of the possible extension of lagrange - flux schemes to compressible multimaterial / multifluid flows , i.e. flows that are composed of different immiscible fluids and separated by free boundaries . + for pure lagrange+remap schemes , usually vof - based interface reconstruction ( ir ) algorithms are used ( young s plic , etc . ) .",
    "after the lagrangian evolution , for the cells that host more than one fluid , fluid interfaces are reconstructed . during the remapping step",
    ", one has to evaluate the mass fluxes per material . from the computational point of view and computing performance",
    ", this process generally slows down the whole performance because of many array indirections in memory and specific treatment into mixed cells along with the material interfaces .    if the geometry of the lagrangian cells is not completely known ( as in the case of lagrange - flux schemes ) , anyway we have to proceed differently . a possibility is to use interface capturing ( ic ) schemes , e.g.  conservative eulerian schemes that evaluate the convected mass fluxes through eulerian cell edges .",
    "this can be achieved by the use of antidiffusive / low - diffusive advection solvers in the spirit of desprs - lagoutire s limited - downwind scheme  @xcite of vofire  @xcite . in a recent work  @xcite , we have analyzed the origin of known artifacts and numerical interface instabilities for this type of solvers and concluded that the reconstruction of fully multidimensional gradients with multidimensional gradient limiters was necessary .",
