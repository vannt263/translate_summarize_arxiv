    "<S> the concept of ergodicity  the convergence of the temporal averages of observables to their ensemble averages  is the cornerstone of thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the transition from a predictable , integrable behavior to ergodicity is one of the most difficult physical phenomena to treat ; the celebrated kam theorem is the prime example . </S>",
    "<S> this letter is founded on the observation that for many classical and quantum observables ,    the sum of the ensemble _ variance _ of the temporal average and the ensemble average of temporal _ variance _ remains constant across the integrability - ergodicity transition .    </S>",

    "<S> , we use this geometry to solve a known problem of optimization of the set of conserved quantities  regardless of whether it comes from symmetries or from finite - size effects  to be incorporated in an extended thermodynamical theory of integrable , near - integrable , or mesoscopic systems @xcite .    consider a ball in a classical rectangular billiards with periodic boundary conditions , first without and then with a strong localized obstacle inside . </S>",
    "<S> ( when present , the obstacle makes the system ergodic . ) in both cases , consider two kinds of problems : 1 . given a specific initial velocity of the ball , what are the subsequent temporal fluctuations in ( say ) the @xmath0-component of the velocity ? </S>",
    "<S> 2 . draw a bunch of initial velocities from a thermal distribution ; for each , compute the infinite time average of the @xmath0-component of the velocity ; what is the variance among these infinite time averages ?    if the obstacle is absent , both components of the velocity vector will remain equal to their initial values forever , and so the temporal fluctuations are zero ; as far as the second question , the variance of the infinite time averages is equal to that in the thermal distribution , and thus is large . on the other hand , if the obstacle is present , the situation is reversed ( this will be so provided the ball keeps hitting the obstacle , which will happen provided the ratio of the velocity components , @xmath1 , is incommensurate with the ratio of the billiard lengths , @xmath2 ; and this will hold with probability one as long as the initial velocities as sampled from some continuous probability distribution ) : now the temporal fluctuations in the velocity component are large no matter what the initial velocity ; at the same time , the infinite time average of the velocity component is the same no matter what the initial velocity ( namely , it is zero ) , and so the variance of the infinite time averages is zero . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as we will show , the shot - to - shot variance in the ( exactly integrable ) case of an empty billiards equals the temporal variance in the ergodic case .    </S>",
    "<S> given some imagination , one may suspect a `` conservation law '' acting across the transition from an integrable to an ergodic system as one increases the strength of the integrability - breaking perturbation . indeed , fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the question of a proper quantum analogue of the temporal fluctuations is both more involved and better studied . </S>",
    "<S> a complication arises from the fact that a quantum state is altered after each measurement . </S>",

    "<S> the soft - core interaction potential has a constant hight @xmath24 at distances of four sites or less , and it is zero otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( see the text for expressions ) are the integrals of motion related to the forth and sixth moments of the momentum distribution of the underlying free fermions . </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , it has been suggested that in case of an ergodic motion , these fluctuations are nothing else but the _ thermal _ fluctuations in the system@xcite . according to this scenario , the quantum uncertainty in the results of the measurements is the way a quantum system emulates the classical instability with respect to the initial conditions : in both cases , the outcome of a single measurement is irreproducible , fundamentally so in the quantum case , and operationally so in the classical one . </S>",

    "<S> both continuous - space and lattice hard - core bosons are known to be integrable : in both cases , there is a map ( girardeau s map@xcite , and the jordan - wigner transformation , respectively ) that connects the eigenstates of the system to the eigenstates of a free fermi gas . </S>",
    "<S> the integrals of motion are thus represented by the occupation numbers of the eigenstates of the one body hamiltonian for the particles of the underlying free fermi gas .    </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the decay of the fourth and sixth integrals of motion , @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the @xmath41-th site annihilation free - fermionic operator ( see also the supplementary discussion ) , as we increase the strength of the non - integrable perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that while the quantum ( the analogue of thermal ) fluctuations gradually increase , the deviations from the ergodicity decrease . </S>",
    "<S> however , in accordance with the conjecture ( [ conjecture ] ) , the sum of the two variances remains approximately constant . </S>",
    "<S> the square of the radius of the circles corresponds to the ensemble variance of the observable , over a series of _ single _ measurements  with no subsequent quantum or temporal averaging  on a randomly chosen eigenstate . </S>",
    "<S> let us now reveal the intuition behind the conjecture ( [ conjecture ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the left - hand - side of the relationship ( [ conjecture ] ) can be written , by rearranging the terms in eqs .  </S>",

    "<S> indeed remark that typically , ergodicity emerges for an interaction strength much weaker than the one required to alter the thermal expectations of observables . </S>",
    "<S> for example , even though the van der waals interactions between the molecules constituting air do not modify the maxwell distribution , the interactions are strong enough to lead to a maxwell distribution from any initial state .    </S>",
    "<S> mathematically , the general criterion for the independence of the ensemble means on @xmath36 may be stated as follows . for every @xmath36 </S>",
    "<S> , there is a characteristic energy interval @xmath42 such that the integrability - breaking perturbation appreciably couples only those eigenstates of the integrable hamiltonian whose energy difference is less than @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> our criterion is that @xmath42 be much smaller than the energy width of the microcanonical window used to define the ensemble means . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is as follows : consider the eigenstates of the unperturbed system . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbation results in their mutual coupling ; but if the criterion is fulfilled , then we may neglect the coupling of states within the window to states outside the window . </S>",
    "<S> but if we do that , then we may , in fact , truncate our hilbert space to just the states inside the window ( let us call the corresponding hamiltonian a ` truncated hamiltonian ' ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , let us first truncate , and then turn on the perturbation . in that case , </S>",
    "<S> the eigenstates of the perturbed truncated hamiltonian are related to those of the unperturbed truncated hamiltonian by a unitary transformation . and now note that the two ensemble means are in fact traces , and thus do not change under unitary transformation of the basis ; thus they do not depend on @xmath36 .    </S>",
