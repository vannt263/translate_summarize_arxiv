    "since several decades , magneto - optical effect has been used for various applications , like sensitive optical magnetometry , and the study of fundamental properties in nature such as parity symmetry violation and wave transport in optically active media .",
    "for example , in a random medium , magneto - optical effect may suppress weak localization of light  @xcite .",
    "it also induces a weak transversal asymmetry in the radiation pattern of a mie scatterer , leading to the appearance of a photonic hall current  @xcite . in a periodic arrangement ,",
    "strong magneto - optical effect in the microwave domain has been used to create topological edge states  @xcite .",
    "all these examples show interesting similarities between electromagnetic wave transport in presence of magneto - optical effect and electronic transport in condensed matter systems .",
    "as discovered by m. faraday in 1845 , magneto - optical effect in a nonabsorbing homogeneous medium leads to a net rotation of a linear polarization when the propagation axis is along the external magnetic field .",
    "this is known as the faraday rotation .",
    "it naturally arises from circular birefringence , _",
    "i.e. _ the phase difference experienced by the two orthogonal circular polarization components of the incident linear polarization .",
    "the rotation angle of the linear polarization is given by : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the external static magnetic field , @xmath3 is the length of the medium , and @xmath4 is the verdet constant of the material . for high sensitivity magnetometry , media with large verdet constant",
    "are required .",
    "this criteria is naturally fulfilled by a medium that has sharp resonances , which show strong dispersive behavior . in this respect ,",
    "extensive studies have been done on atomic vapors ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "so far , the best performances are obtained using electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) . here",
    ", a narrow resonance emerges from the two - photon coupling of the ground state manifold which dramatically increases the sensitivity  @xcite .",
    "importantly , the two - photon resonance is insensitive to doppler frequency shift .",
    "this scheme , known as the nonlinear magneto - optical rotation ( nmor ) , has been optimized over the years using different strategies . one strategy is to increase the ground state coherence lifetime using thermal vapor cells with anti - relaxation walls  @xcite or cold gases  @xcite .",
    "other strategies , including the use of squeezed light  @xcite , optically dense media  @xcite and resonant cavity enhancement  @xcite , have been also implemented .    in this paper , we report the observation of magneto - optical effect on the @xmath5s@xmath6p@xmath7 intercombination line of laser cooled ^88^sr atoms . here , the transition is typically three orders of magnitude narrower than the usual alkali atoms .",
    "thus , the sensitivity of the linear magneto - optical rotation ( lmor ) is increased by the same order of magnitude .",
    "however , the ground state is non - degenerate , so nmor due to ground state coherence in eit scheme is absent .",
    "instead , nmor occurs because of the coherence in the excited substates .",
    "the interplay between lmor and nmor depends on both the probe intensity and the temperature of the gas .",
    "we show that nmor is favored at high probe beam intensity , when the transition linewidth is dominated by doppler broadening .",
    "we study as well the voigt or cotton - mouton rotation , when the external magnetic field is in the plane orthogonal to the optical axis . here",
    ", the magneto - optical rotation angle scales as a square of the magnetic field . similar to the faraday rotation , we observe an anomalous curvature close to zero magnetic field , which has a sign that is opposite to its linear counterpart .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the description of the experimental setup is given in section  [ experimental setup ] .",
    "in section  [ theoretical formulation ] , we derive the general expression of the lmor in the faraday and voigt configurations .",
    "these two configurations under nmor , are further analyzed in sections  [ faraday rotation ] and  [ voigt rotation ] and compared with the experimental results .",
    "finally , we give our conclusions in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the preparation of the laser - cooled ^88^sr atoms is described in detail in ref .  @xcite .",
    "after the magneto - optical trap ( mot ) is switched off , the cold gas is held in a molasses for 20  ms followed by free expansion for another 20  ms , before the experiment is performed .",
    "the atomic cloud has a typical optical thickness of @xmath8 .",
    "the typical temperature of the cloud is 1.2(2 )  @xmath9k .",
    "the 4-@xmath10 diameters of the cloud , in a plane perpendicular to the probe propagation axis , are 2.0(1 )  mm and 1.0(1 )  mm . by adjusting the cooling parameters ,",
    "the optical thickness can be increased to 2.6 and the cloud temperature can be increased up to 15  @xmath9k .",
    "the external static magnetic field , applied during the experiment , is controlled using a feedback loop system  @xcite .",
    "the system removes the other unwanted magnetic field components including the 50  hz contribution .",
    "the magnetic field is stabilized below the 1  mg level over the duration of the experiment .",

    "the largest rotation is observed at around @xmath8511 mg instead of @xmath86 .",

    "a study of the sensitivity as a function of the probe intensity , at @xmath98 , is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : mor_int ] .",
    "the experimental sensitivity is about 0.8 times lower than the theoretical prediction corresponding to the numerical integration of eqs .  ",
    "( see the green solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : faraday ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy may be due to systematic effects such as finite linewidth of our probe laser  @xcite , unbalanced polarization channel or an overestimate of the cloud optical thickness . at @xmath99 ,",
    "the sensitivity goes to zero , meaning that the lmor and nmor effects cancel out . increasing further @xmath51 ,",
    "the sensitivity reaches an optimal positive value at @xmath100 . at larger probe intensity",
    ", the sensitivity decreases smoothly toward zero because of the power broadening of the transition .",
    "we observe , in the results of the numerical integrations , the same qualitative behavior for various temperatures .",
    "however , at low temperature ( see the red dashed curve for @xmath101 in fig .",
    "[ fig : mor_int ] ) the cancelation between the lmor and nmor effects occurs at large probe intensity . indeed , according to eq .",
    "the lmor is maximal at @xmath101 whereas the nmor is temperature independent . for a similar reason , at higher temperature , the cancelation between the lmor and nmor effects occurs at a lower intensity of the probe beam .",
    "next , we study the sensitivity as a function of the optical thickness . according to eq .",
    ", for a given temperature , we expect the sensitivity to be linearly dependent on the optical thickness @xmath102 in the lmor regime .",
    "it is observed in the experiment , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mor_od ] ( see the red open circles ) . here",
    ", the temperature is @xmath98 , thus the sensitivity should be reduced by a factor 0.05 with respect to the zero temperature values given in eq .  .",
    "the experimentally measured sensitivity are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction given by eq .   even though it is slightly lower by a factor of typically 0.8 .",
    "the possible reasons for this difference were pointed out earlier . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mor_od ] , experimental data corresponding to high probe intensities are also shown .",
    "as for lmor , we observe a linear dependency of the sensitivity with respect to the optical thickness .",
    "the optical thickness values are extracted from transmission measurements performed at low probe intensity .",
    "the numerical simulations of eqs .   show that the linear dependency of the sensitivity is well fulfilled at low @xmath102 but might be not correct for larger @xmath102 ( see for example the @xmath103 green dashed curve at @xmath104 in fig .",
    "[ fig : mor_od ] ) .",
    "the breakdown of the linear dependence on @xmath52 has a simple explanation .",
    "it is due to the probe absorption in the medium .",
    "thus , the probe saturates the medium only at its entrance but not anymore at its deeper layers .",
    "the sensitivity , therefore , becomes smaller at larger values of the optical thickness .",
    "finally , we discuss the dependence of the sensitivity as a function of the temperature of the cold gas .",
    "examples in the lmor and nmor regimes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mor_temp ] . to avoid variations of the optical thickness due to the preparation of the cold gas at different temperature",
    ", we define a normalized sensitivity @xmath105 , with the sensitivity divided by the optical thickness .",
    "importantly , this procedure is justified because the optical thickness is @xmath106 which is weak enough for the sensitivity to be proportional to @xmath102 for any probe intensity used in the experiment . in the lmor regime",
    ", the absolute sensitivity decays as @xmath107 at large temperature ( see eq .   and its representation as the black dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : mor_temp ] ) . the exact solution , given by eq .  ,",
    "is represented by the red solid curve . the red dashed curve , which is the theoretical curve scaled by a factor of 0.8 , matches well with the experimental data points represented by the red dots . in the nmor regime , the absolute sensitivity increases with temperature ( see blue open circles in fig .  [",
    "fig : mor_temp ] ) . here , again the theoretical prediction has to be multiplied by a factor of 0.8 to obtain a good agreement with the experimental data points ( see the dash - dotted and the dashed curves ) . at high temperature ,",
    "the sensitivity saturates to @xmath108 .",
    "this saturation has a simple explanation .",
    "it occurs once the doppler broadening has the same order of magnitude than the power broadening . further increasing",
    "the temperature will not increase the number of atoms participating in the nmor signal , leading to a saturation of the sensitivity .",
    "similar to the faraday rotation , the voigt rotation shows qualitatively different behavior between weak and strong probe intensity . at weak intensity ( see the blue open circles in fig .  [",
    "fig : voigt ] ) , we observe a quadratic dependence of the rotation angle to the magnetic field , as predicted by eqs .",
    ". at larger probe intensity ( see the red filled circles corresponding to @xmath109 in fig .  [",
    "fig : voigt ] ) , an anomalous nmor with positive curvature is observed .",
    "this anomalous voigt effect has a similar origin as in the case of faraday rotation .",
    "it is due to coherence among the excited substates . for faraday rotation ,",
    "only the @xmath89 and @xmath90 excited substates are concerned . here , the substate @xmath54 is also coupled to the light field , leading to an extra coherence contributions .",
    "we have reported studies of the linear and nonlinear magneto - optical rotation on a cold strontium cloud using the intercombination line .",
    "using moderately doppler broadened samples , both lmor and nmor are clearly observed in the experiments for the faraday and the voigt configurations . in this regime , nmor gives a feature narrower than lmor because of its insensitivity to doppler frequency shift .",
    "in particular , we show that , at large temperature , only nmor is present and gives a significant contribution at large intensity .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the strontium intercombination line is the narrowest one - photon transition used so far to study magneto - optical rotation .",
    "our best sensitivity of @xmath110 is measured for @xmath111 , and t= in the linear regime .",
    "this value is roughly a factor of @xmath112 times smaller than the maximal value expected at @xmath101 .",
    "the corresponding verdet constant is @xmath113  .",
    "this value is typically two orders of magnitude larger than the values reported for standard alkali cold gas  @xcite .",
    "the large verdet constant might be promising to develop a sensitive optical magnetometer based on a low temperature strontium gas on the intercombination line .",
    "however , the lmor regime is obtained only when the probe intensity is lower than the saturation intensity @xmath114 . since @xmath114 is proportional to @xmath91",
    ", we expect that the ultimate performance of an photons short noise limited optical magnetometer , based on lmor , would be independent of the linewidth of the transition . in the nmor regime",
    "such restriction on the probe intensity does not occur .",
    "thus a new optical magnetometer based on nmor on a narrow transition might be considered .",
