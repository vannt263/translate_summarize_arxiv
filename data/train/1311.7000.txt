    "a deep understanding of the underlying physics of boundary layer separation behaviour is crucial when considering the problem of controlling detached flows .",
    "flow instabilities may be the cause of this separation . a stability analysis of a flow can help to predict when these instabilities arise , and can be used to design flow controllers . to perform a stability analysis , it is necessary to construct the `` base flow '' around which the system will be linearised .",
    "this leads to the challenge of obtaining a steady state solution of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "there are alternatives to this , namely to compute the time average of an unsteady solution , or to obtain a solution of the reynolds averaged navier - stokes ( rans ) equations to use as the base flow .",
    "however , these solutions often produce stability properties which are not relevant to the physical solution @xcite .",
    "hence , we are interested in solver algorithms to obtain genuine steady - state solutions of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "one possible approach is to use newton s method , however it must be combined with a continuation method since a good initial guess of the solution is required to ensure convergence . for challenging flow problems at high reynolds number , it may be the case that many complicated bifurcations at various reynolds numbers must be crossed before finding the required solution . as an alternative , @xmath3kervik _ et al . _",
    "@xcite presented a modification of the time - dependent dynamical system , called selective frequency damping ( sfd ) , which tries to reach the steady - state of an unsteady system by damping unstable temporal frequencies . since it is easy to implement into an existing code , and",
    "does not need a good initial guess , this method appeared to be an efficient alternative to classical newton s methods .",
    "the sfd method has been successfully applied to find steady - solutions of the navier - stokes equations , which were then used as a base flow to study stability properties of flows such as the wake of a sphere @xcite , a jet in a crossflow @xcite or a cavity flow @xcite .",
    "however jones and sandberg @xcite failed to find the steady - state of the compressible flow around a naca-0012 airfoil at @xmath4 using the sfd method .",
    "it was assumed there that the method was not able to suppress the instabilities present at this reynolds number without requiring a large damping coefficient and hence impractically long time - integration to converge .",
    "vyazmina @xcite studied swirling flows and it was noticed that the sfd method did not converge towards the steady - state when the problem considered had real unstable eigenvalues .",
    "in this paper we present a time discrete formulation of the sfd method which is implemented as a wrapper around an existing `` black box '' unsteady solver . in section [ sectionproblemformulation ]",
    "we first recall the original form of the sfd method and then show that with the splitting methods framework the method can be reformulated .",
    "this alternative formulation encapsulates the existing solver .",
    "this scheme is applied to a simple one - dimensional problem in section [ 1dprb ] .",
    "the convergence properties of this formulation are studied in order to provide information about the influence of the filter width and the control coefficient on the stability of the method .",
    "then the results obtained by the application of the encapsulated sfd method to a high - order incompressible navier - stokes solver are presented in section [ sectionnumericalsimulation ] .",
    "finally , we introduce the idea that isolating the most unstable eigenmode of a flow problem and treating it as a one - dimensional problem can give sufficient information in order to ensure the convergence of the sfd problem applied to a navier - stokes solver .",
    "we first recall the basis of the sfd method as it was originally introduced",
    ". then we present the discretized encapsulated formulation .    with appropriate initial and boundary conditions ,",
    "any system can be written @xmath5 where @xmath6 represents the problem unknown(s ) , the dot represents the time derivative and @xmath7 is an operator ( which can be nonlinear ) .",
    "the steady - state @xmath8 of this problem is reached when @xmath9 .",
    "the main idea of the sfd method is to introduce a linear forcing term on the right - hand side of ( [ system ] ) .",
    "this term must contain a control coefficient and a target towards which the solution will be driven to . a new problem formulation",
    "is then defined such as @xmath10 where @xmath0 is the control coefficient and @xmath8 is the target steady - state .",
    "this stabilization technique is called proportional feedback control and is commonly used in control theory @xcite . when @xmath8 is a genuine steady - state , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath11 , the steady solution of ( [ sfd ] ) is clearly also the steady solution of ( [ system ] ) .",
    "however , in practice , especially for real flow problems , the steady - state is generally not known _ a priori_. the sfd method addresses this by replacing @xmath8 by a low - pass filtered version of @xmath6 , denoted @xmath12 . by damping the most dangerous frequencies ,",
    "the corresponding instabilities are extinguished @xcite .",
    "this idea was originally introduced by pruett _",
    "@xcite in their work on a temporal filtered model developed for large - eddy simulations .",
    "the differential form of a ( first order ) low - pass time filter can be defined as @xmath13 where @xmath12 is the temporally filtered quantity and @xmath1 is the filter width .",
    "this equation can be advanced in time using any appropriate integration scheme .    considering ( [ sfd ] ) , with the new target solution @xmath12 , and the filter ( [ filter ] )",
    ", we obtain the system @xmath14    this system is the continuous time formulation of the sfd method , as it was first introduced @xcite . the filtered solution",
    "@xmath12 is time varying , and the steady - state is reached when @xmath15 .",
    "we now present a time - discrete implementation of the sfd method which allows us to wrap code around an existing time - stepping scheme for equation [ system ] .",
    "this notion can be linked to tuckerman s work @xcite on the adaptation of time - stepping codes to carry out efficient bifurcation analysis",
    ".    system ( [ sfd - general ] ) can be discretised within the framework of sequential operator - splitting methods @xcite .",
    "the system is divided into two smaller subsystems which are solved separately using different numerical schemes .",
    "the first subproblem ( which can be nonlinear ) is simply ( [ system ] ) .",
    "we introduce the function @xmath16 such that the numerical ( or exact ) solution of ( [ system ] ) at the step @xmath17 is given by @xmath18    the second subproblem is linear and represents the actions of the feedback control and the low - pass time filter .",
    "it can be formulated @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the identity matrix .",
    "the linear operator defined by ( [ subproblem2 ] ) will be denoted @xmath21 .",
    "this equation can be solved exactly on @xmath22 $ ] and the solution is given by @xmath23 where the expanded expression of @xmath24 is @xmath25\\\\   i - i e^{-(\\chi + \\frac{1}{\\delta})\\delta t } & \\chi \\delta i + i e^{-(\\chi + \\frac{1}{\\delta})\\delta t } \\end{pmatrix}. \\label{explinearoperator_developed}\\ ] ]    in the construction of a splitting method , the final solution of one subproblem is used as initial condition of the other one . as ( [ subproblem1 ] )",
    "does not affect @xmath12 , the discrete formulation of ( [ sfd - general ] ) using a first order splitting method is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the time step used within the solver @xmath16 .",
    "we call this scheme `` encapsulated '' since @xmath16 is not modified but simply used as an input of the linear solver ( [ exactsolsubproblem2 ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath16 can be treated as a `` black box '' .",
    "codes which solve the navier - stokes equations are usually very complicated",
    ". if the original problem ( [ system ] ) is a flow problem , implementing an efficient steady - state solver with minimum programming effort can be highly valuable . to implement ( [ splittingsfd ] ) in an existing code ,",
    "the only work required is to create an auxiliary variable @xmath28 which takes the value of the outcome of ( [ subproblem1 ] ) .",
    "then the linear operator @xmath29 ( which is constant through time ) simply has to be applied to the vector @xmath30 .",
    "note that a second order strang splitting method can also be used to solve ( [ sfd - general ] ) . for clarity we only present the first order scheme here .",
    "this method does not converge to a steady - state for arbitrary control coefficient @xmath0 and filter width @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath16 is a linear map , the convergence of ( [ splittingsfd ] ) towards the steady - state of ( [ system ] ) is guaranteed if all the eigenvalue magnitudes of this system are strictly smaller than one .",
    "such a system is said to be ( linearly ) stable .",
    "as ( [ splittingsfd ] ) depends on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , these parameters play a key role in the stability of the sfd method . in the next section ,",
    "we analyse this role , using a one - dimensional model .",
    "in this section a simple one - dimensional problem is studied in order to analyse the influence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the stability of the sfd method .",
    "a clear understanding of their role should help users of the sfd method to choose parameters that ensure its convergence .",
    "the scalar problem considered is @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "this equation has exact solver @xmath33 for the remainder of this section we set @xmath34 .    the convergence towards the steady - state of ( [ 1dequation ] ) ( _ i .",
    "e. @xmath35 _ ) is guaranteed if @xmath36 .",
    "we aim to use sfd to reach the steady - state of ( [ 1dequation ] ) when @xmath37 .",
    "analysing this simple case will allow us to highlight the roles of the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the convergence ( or not ) of the sfd method .    in order to write the encapsulated formulation of the sfd method applied to ( [ 1dequation ] )",
    ", we use the function @xmath38 such that @xmath39 .",
    "then we introduce the operator @xmath40 which has the same form as ( [ subproblem2 ] ) upon replacing @xmath20 with @xmath41 .",
    "the application of the encapsulated formulation of the sfd method to ( [ 1dequation ] ) becomes @xmath42    the eigenvalues ( noted @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) of the matrix defined by system ( [ 1d_splittingsfd ] ) can then easily be evaluated , as functions of the control coefficient @xmath0 , the filter width @xmath1 and the complex number @xmath45 . to ensure the stability of ( [ 1d_splittingsfd ] )",
    ", we want to be able to choose @xmath0 and @xmath1 such that max@xmath46 .    from these eigenvalues",
    "we obtain the following limiting behaviour for small @xmath0 and @xmath1 : @xmath47    if the original problem is not converging , applying the sfd method and choosing a small control coefficient @xmath0 will not drive the solution towards its steady - state .",
    "we also obtain the following large @xmath0 and @xmath1 limits : @xmath48    if the control coefficient @xmath0 ( or the filter width @xmath1 ) is chosen to be large , the encapsulated formulation of the sfd method is marginally stable .",
    "the steady - state can not be reached but the solution does not blow up .",
    "we now examine the stability regions of the encapsulated formulations of the sfd method .",
    "the goal , for a given control coefficient and filter width , is to identify for which @xmath45 the one - dimensional problem will converge towards its steady - state .",
    "this section is only focused on the influence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    in the stability diagram in figure [ stabregions ] , each point of the complex plane corresponds to the value of @xmath45 .",
    "the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are fixed for every point , and the eigenvalues of matrix ( [ 1d_splittingsfd ] ) are evaluated .",
    "if both eigenvalue magnitudes are smaller than one , then the point is coloured in grey .",
    "hence the grey area corresponds to the stability region of ( [ 1d_splittingsfd ] ) . in other words ,",
    "figure [ stabregions ] tells us that @xmath49 and @xmath50 will drive ( [ 1d_splittingsfd ] ) towards its steady - state for every @xmath45 chosen within the grey area .",
    "we recall that ( [ 1dequation ] ) was stable only if @xmath36 ( _ i .",
    "e. _ only if @xmath45 was situated within the unit disc , delimited by the white circle on figure [ stabregions ] ) . the stability region of ( [ 1d_splittingsfd ] ) expands beyond the unit disc .",
    "these pictures allow us to visualize the fact that the sfd method stabilizes unstable modes .",
    "this is achieved without introducing a loss of stability elsewhere , indeed the stability region of the original problem ( _ i .",
    "e. _ the unit disc ) is inside the stability region .    on each stability diagram presented in figure [ stabregions ]",
    ", we notice that if @xmath45 is real and greater than one , it is not possible to find a couple @xmath0 and @xmath1 for which ( [ 1d_splittingsfd ] ) is stable .",
    "such an @xmath45 corresponds to a problem with a pure exponential growth of the instability .",
    "hence we can conclude that the stability of the sfd method relies on the oscillatory growth of the problem studied .",
    "this is because time averaging oscillatory growth produces a good estimate of the equilibrium , whilst time averaging exponential growth does not .",
    "this was reported by vyazmina @xcite , who said that if an unstable eigenvalue is real and positive , there is no frequency to be damped by the sfd method .",
    "figure [ stabregions ] presents stability regions for a fixed value of the control coefficient @xmath0 . with a different @xmath0 ,",
    "the shape of these stability regions would have been similar but the area covered would have been different .",
    "this behaviour is shown in figure [ stabcontours_fixeddelta ] .",
    "contours of the stability regions of ( [ 1d_splittingsfd ] ) for @xmath51 and two different @xmath0 .",
    "the central circle represents the boundary of the unit disc.,width=302 ]    @xmath3kervik _ et al . _",
    "@xcite stated that choosing a large @xmath0 or a large @xmath1 would make the system evolution very slow but the sfd method would eventually converge to a steady - state .",
    "the results presented in figure [ stabcontours_fixeddelta ] suggest that this may not always be true .",
    "indeed , this picture shows that there is a region where ( [ 1d_splittingsfd ] ) is stable for @xmath52 and @xmath51 but unstable for @xmath49 and @xmath51 . hence increasing the control coefficient is not always an appropriate method to guarantee the convergence of the sfd method towards the steady - state .    when choosing a large filter width , the behaviour of the sfd method is slightly different . for a given @xmath0 and a large @xmath1 ,",
    "if the sfd method is not stable then it is not possible to find a smaller @xmath1 for which the method is stable .",
    "this is illustrated by the fact that the regions presented in figures [ stabregions ] , [ stabregions ] and [ stabregions ] are all included within the region presented in figure [ stabregions ] .",
    "however , choosing a very large @xmath1 does not guarantee the stability of ( [ 1d_splittingsfd ] ) .",
    "if @xmath45 is situated at the right of the unit circle , close to the real axis , increasing the filter with without acting on the control coefficient might not be enough to enable the sfd method to converge .",
    "when @xmath53 and when @xmath1 tends to zero , the stability region of ( [ 1d_splittingsfd ] ) fits exactly within the unit circle , confirming the outcome of the limiting behaviour analysis for the scalar problem ( for conciseness these figures are not presented here ) .",
    "if a second order strang splitting method is used to reformulate ( [ sfd - general ] ) applied to the scalar problem ( [ 1dequation ] ) , the stability regions obtained are exactly the same as the ones presented in this section .",
    "this is because the second - order splitting can be written as a shifted first - order splitting with a pre- and post - processing step , so both methods have the same stability regions .",
    "the encapsulated sfd method ( [ splittingsfd ] ) was implemented into the nektar++ spectral/_hp _ element framework @xcite , as a wrapper function . in order to find the steady state solution of the incompressible navier - stokes equations , a solver which implements the _ velocity - correction _",
    "scheme @xcite ( symbolised by the functions @xmath16 in ( [ splittingsfd ] ) ) is called at each time - step . in this section",
    "we present the numerical steady - state of the two dimensional cylinder flow above its critical reynolds number @xmath54 ( _ i .",
    "e. _ when the reynolds number is high enough such that the viscous forces within the flow are not dominant ) .    at @xmath55",
    "the two - dimensional incompressible flow past a cylinder is unstable and von krmn vortex streets are observable .",
    "indeed , shedding vortices appear when @xmath56 and this phenomenon remains until the end of the subcritical regime ( @xmath57 ) @xcite .",
    "hence the role of the sfd method is to suppress these oscillations and drive the solution towards its steady - state .",

    "the cylinder is centred at the origin and its diameter is one unit length .",

    "dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath60 are imposed on the left , top and bottom edges .",
    "finally an outflow boundary condition is set on the right edge .",
    "as the steady solution is expected to be smooth , a high polynomial order of 11 is used . to highlight the fact that , in contrast to newton s methods , the sfd method does not need a good approximation of the final solution to converge , initial conditions such as @xmath61 are chosen .",
    "the sfd parameters are initially chosen such that the control coefficient @xmath49 and the filter width @xmath62 . the problem is considered to have converged when @xmath63 . the steady - state has been obtained after the computation of about 1000 time units ( with the time - step @xmath64 ) and the decay of @xmath65 is simply a reminder of the behaviour of the uncontrolled incompressible cylinder flow at @xmath2 and the steady - state obtained by sfd is shown on figure [ diplayresultx1delta2 ] .",
    "this flow configuration is identical to the one presented by barkley @xcite .",
    "a stability analysis , using an arnoldi method , is performed with this steady - state as the `` base flow '' .",
    "the growth rate @xmath66 and the frequency @xmath7 of this flow configuration are @xmath67 which correspond to the values presented by barkley @xcite .",
    "if the time length of each arnoldi iteration is defined as being equal to one time unit , this growth rate and this frequency correspond to the two dominant ( conjugate ) eigenvalues @xmath68    as @xmath69 , the flow is unstable and the corresponding instabilities exponentially grow through time",
    ". however the sfd method was able to stabilise the flow and allowed it to converge towards its steady - state .",
    "we now verify that if the sfd method is able to stabilize the most unstable eigenmode of a flow problem then the method will converge towards the steady flow . in other words , if @xmath70 is the dominant unstable ( _ i .",
