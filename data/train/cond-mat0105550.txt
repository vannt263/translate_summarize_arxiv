    "we consider the de model with the inclusion of the single - site impurity potential .",

    "since we use cpa for electronic properties it is consistent to construct the landau functional using a mean - field approach .",
    "mean - field means that we do not take into account large - scale fluctuations of the macroscopic magnetization @xmath85 , but within cpa we certainly take into account microscopic fluctuations of @xmath7 . in the mean - field approximation",
