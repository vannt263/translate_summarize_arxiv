    "globular clusters are very efficient catalysts in forming unusual objects , such as low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , millisecond pulsars ( msps ) , and blue stragglers , with formation rates per unit mass exceeding those in the galactic disk by orders of magnitude .",
    "the high stellar densities in globular clusters trigger various dynamical interactions : exchanges in encounters with binaries , direct collisions , destruction of binaries , and perhaps tidal capture .",
    "many details of these processes are not well understood , primarily because of the complex feedback between stellar evolution and stellar dynamics .",
    "the rate of these competing processes depends strongly on the cluster s physical properties .",
    "for example , binary formation by tidal capture generally requires higher densities than do exchange reactions involving primordial binaries @xcite . in the outermost regions of even the densest clusters",
    ", the currently observed binaries will be mainly primordial ones .",
    "in contrast , the lmxbs and the msps that consequently evolve from the lmxbs are formed ( almost ) exclusively via stellar encounters . @xcite",

    "the x - ray spectra and luminosities indicate that these are lmxbs ; orbital periods from 11 minutes to 17.1 hours have been determined for five sources . in 11 sources ,",
    "type i x - ray bursts have been detected ( in t zand et al.1999 and references therein ) , which are well explained as thermonuclear runaways on a neutron star surface ( for a review see lewin , van paradijs , & taam 1993 ) .",

    ", some of the sources outside the cores may be in the background or foreground ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . due to crowding and the limited accuracy of even the _ rosat _  positions ( varying from 25 , depending on whether a secure optical identification allows accurate determination of the bore sight correction ) , optical identifications of faint x - ray sources in globular cluster cores remained tentative before the _ chandra _  era , and some suggestions have been disproved with more accurate x - ray positions , as in 47  tuc @xcite and m  92 @xcite . the only secure optical identification was that of a dwarf nova with a faint x - ray source 12 core radii from the center of ngc  5904 @xcite .",

    "we aim to tie each _",

    "unfortunately , owing to the brightness and stellar density of the cluster core neither catalog extends to within 5  of the center .",
    "however , the _ hst _ archive also contains numerous ( largely v - band ) images extending from the cluster center out to a @xmath110  radius , and these outermost images do overlap with the usno a-2 coverage . on the basis of the _ hst _  pointing information ( contained in each image header ) , we used the iraf / stsdas routine _ _ metric ( which includes corrections for geometrical distortions towards the edge of each chip ) to over - plot the nominal usno star positions . to aid in the matching we also then degraded the",
    "_ hst_images by convolving with a gaussian to approximate the typical ground - based seeing of the plates used in deriving the catalog .",
    "it was then possible to make 58 reliable matches , on two separate _ hst_datasets ( i.e. , from different satellite pointings ) , deriving offsets of 11 and 01 in ra and dec .",
    ", respectively .",
    "we found no evidence for a significant discrepancy in the nominal roll - angle , and hence we made no correction to this parameter .",
    "taking the scatter to the astrometric fit and , in particular , the uncertainty in the roll - angle , we estimate residual uncertainties of a few tenths of an arcsecond .    having aligned these outermost",
    "images , we then had to step in via intermediate overlapping _",
    "hst _  images to find corrections for all the useful images of the cluster center .",
    "the procedure was essentially the same for each step .",
    "we measured the centroids of all bright ( but not saturated ) stars appearing in the overlap regions of two _ hst _",
    "datasets and then applied _ _ invmetric to derive their nominal ra and dec according to the headers .",
    "pairs were then matched and average offsets in sky coordinates calculated .",
    "again , in no case did there appear to be any significant roll - angle discrepancies present .",
    "for these steps , we more typically found a few hundred matches , and hence the uncertainty in the measured offsets was negligible relative to that of the initial tie to the usno a-2 ( icrs ) frame .",
    "the final stage made use of the prior identifications of two h@xmath14 bright stars by @xcite .",
    "over - plotting our _ chandra_sources for the core revealed that the two optical stars flagged in the bailyn et al .  finding chart ( their fig",
    ".  2 ) are indeed excellent matches to two of our x - ray sources . specifically , our analyses of the relative positions and position angles in both the x - ray and the optical for these two flagged stars were fully in agreement .",
    "( note that our astrometric solution for the position of these two objects differs in ra and dec by 033 ( @xmath43 ) and 84 , respectively , from the positions given by bailyn et al .",

    "however , this is consistent with the expected uncertainty in our astrometric solution for these _ hst _",
    "images relative to the icrs frame .",
    "hence , we decided to apply this small offset ( assuming that these two stars are exactly at their _ chandra _  positions ) to the astrometry for all of our _ hst _  datasets . in order to be thorough",
    ", we opted to examine all optical / uv stars within @xmath105 of each _ chandra _  source position . indeed , as we describe in detail below , we then uncovered at least 3 more strong candidate optical counterparts , none of which was more than 01 from the expected position based upon this offset .",
    "such results are indeed consistent with uncertainties expected in the relative astrometry of the x - ray positions , combined with their transfer to a variety of _ hst _  datasets",
    ".      the data from the _ hst _  archive are already well - calibrated ( aside from astrometry ) , and only two steps remained . for each pointing and filter ,",
    "at least two images were available , which were then used to remove the numerous cosmic ray events detected in each exposure .",
    "we used the _ _ combine task to calculate an average image and applied one - sided sigma clipping ( based on the median value of each pixel and a noise model for the detector ) to exclude cosmic ray events .",
    "the images from each of the four chips were then trimmed to remove the partially masked edge regions .",
    "we employed _",
    "_ daofind in the iraf implementation of daophot ii @xcite to find all stars detected at approximately 3@xmath44 above background , and we then determined their centroids .",
    "unfortunately , this method is not fool - proof , and we also had to add a number of faint stars by hand to our list and delete others affected by the @xmath120 saturated stars appearing on each frame .",
    "we excluded all stars with centers within @xmath11015 pixels of any saturated pixels and also any stars lying on the cross - shaped diffraction patterns of the very brightest stars .",
    "having thus created a master star list for each image , aperture photometry yielded magnitudes for a range of annuli close to the measured fwhm of the psf .",
    "we note that , for the undersampled stellar psfs of the pc and especially the wf chips , aperture photometry produced better results than our attempts at psf fitting .",
    "the apertures we used are , however , far smaller than the standard 05 aperture of the stmag system @xcite , and we therefore estimated the corresponding magnitude offsets needed relative to this large aperture for a number of bright ( but non - saturated ) and isolated stars on both the pc and wf chips . applying both these offsets and the appropriate zeropoints based upon the sensitivity information in each header , we finally arrived at the stmags in a given filter for each star .",
    "we note that accurate estimation of the background contribution ( especially critical for the faintest stars ) , is very difficult in such a crowded field .",
    "we adopted the mode value for an annulus surrounding each star .",
    "tests , using either a fixed value as determined by averaging the results for the least crowded stars ( farther from the core ) or using the centroid of a gaussian fit to the `` sky '' histogram instead of the mode , showed that we can expect systematic errors of @xmath10.10.2 mags in our final stmag values .",
    "we have also applied approximate corrections to the magnitudes derived from aperture photometry to compensate for the time - dependent charge - transfer - efficiency effect and the so - called `` long versus short anomaly , '' according to the formulae presented on the wfpc2 instrument web - pages ( http://www.stsci.edu/instruments/wfpc2/ ) .",

    "the optical counterparts for cx12 and cx18 would have visual fluxes more than about 3 mag fainter than our limits if they were dwarf novae in quiescence",
    ". they can be as bright as our limits if they are dwarf novae in outburst or nova - like variables of the ux uma type ( i.e. , non - magnetic , permanently bright cataclysmic variables ) .",
    "the location of cx5 in the optical color - magnitude diagrams is similar to that of cx16 , as is its moderate h@xmath14 emission .",
    "this suggests that it is an rs  cvn system ( more precisely , a by  dra system ) .",
    "its high x - ray to optical flux ratio and spectral hardness are more suggestive of a cataclysmic variable , however .",
    "as remarked above , our _ chandra _  sources have x - ray luminosities in the range also observed for msps in the galactic disk . in this respect ,",
    "the x - ray sources for which we have no optical counterparts could be msps .",
    "also , as stated in  [ sect : xraysrcs ] , we expect @xmath14 serendipitous background sources within the half - mass radius",
    ". the optically unidentified faint x - ray sources may well be such background sources .",
    "alas , no period derivatives or positions are as yet available for the five msps , with periods ranging from 3.3 to 9.0  msec , now known in ngc  6752 @xcite .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of an msp is only a small fraction of the spin - down luminosity @xcite , and the latter is proportional to @xmath51 ( with @xmath52 the pulse period ) . to illustrate this we write the x - ray luminosity @xmath53 as a fraction @xmath54 of the spindown luminosity @xmath55 @xmath56 where @xmath57 g",
    "@xmath58 is the moment of inertia of the neutron star , @xmath59 its characteristic age , and @xmath60 the intrinsic period derivative .",
    "entering characteristic values we obtain @xmath61 we think that the most likely candidates are psrs j1910@xmath6259a , c and e , which have the shortest periods and should therefore be the brightest in x - rays .",
    "the least luminous x - ray sources appear the more likely candidates , in particular cx17 , which has a radio counterpart .",
    "however , cx8 has a very soft spectrum , and in our view can not be excluded .",
    "all of our likely source identifications are indicated in the x - ray color - magnitude diagram ( fig .  [",
    "fig : xraycmd ] ) .",
    "our _ chandra _  observation provides a dramatic improvement over the _ rosat _",
    "hri observations .",
    "the central x - ray emission of ngc  6752 , resolved into 4 sources by the _ rosat _",
    "hri , is now found to be due to ten sources .",
    "the very accurate positions of these and other newly discovered sources allow secure identifications with _ hst _  sources and with one radio source .    outside the core ,",
    "the two sources cx2 and cx3 correspond to the _ rosat _  sources x14 and x6 , respectively . from these",
    "two we determine an offset of ( 19 , @xmath6221 ) that has to be applied to the _ rosat _  positions ( as given by verbunt &  johnston 2000 ) to align them with the _ chandra _  frame .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rosatcontours ] we show the positions of the central sources that we have detected with _ chandra _  superposed on a contour of the _ rosat _  hri observation to which this offset has been applied .",
    "we then find that cx6 and cx1 correspond to x22 and x7b , respectively , whereas _",
    "source x7a has been resolved into cx11 , cx12 , and cx14 , and x21 into cx4 , cx5 , cx7 , and cx9 .    from our spectral fits to the _ chandra _  sources , we can estimate the _ rosat _  hri and pspc countrates for the luminosities at which _ chandra _  detected them : 1  _ chandra _  count in our observation corresponds to about 0.0045 cts / ks in the _ rosat _  hri observations and to 0.009 cts / ks ( channels 52201 ) in the _ rosat _  pspc observation . with this conversion",
    "we find that the luminosities of x14/cx2 , x6/cx3 , x22/cx6 , x7a/(cx4 , 5 , 7 , 9 ) and x21/(cx11 , 12 , 14 ) are constant within the errors between the _ rosat _  hri and _ chandra_observation .",
    "/ cx1 , however , was about 30%  brighter in the _ rosat _  hri than in the _ chandra _  observation .",
    "the central conglomerate of sources was about 40%  brighter during the _",
    "rosat_pspc observation than during the _ chandra _  observation ; due to the lack of spatial resolution in the pspc we can not assign this to a specific _ chandra _  source .",
    "we thus have evidence that the x - ray luminosity of at least one central source , cx1 , is variable .",
    "both x - ray and optical variability will be discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "_ chandra _  observations have been published for three other globular clusters that do not contain a bright ( @xmath63  ) central x - ray source .",
    "the numbers of _ identified _ sources of various types are summarized in table  [ tab : compare ] . of these clusters ,",
    "47  tuc has a larger core and slightly smaller central density than ngc  6752 , causing the frequency of close encounters in 47  tuc to be a factor @xmath110 larger than that in ngc  6752 .",
    "ngc  6397 has a higher core density and much smaller core radius than ngc  6752 , leading to a frequency of close encounters a factor @xmath110 smaller than in ngc  6752 .",
    "finally , @xmath6  cen has a smaller central density and larger core than any of these clusters , and an encounter frequency similar to that in ngc  6752 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of currently known quiescent soft x - ray transients with neutron stars in the galactic disk does not drop below @xmath64 erg  s@xmath25 .",
    "if a similar lower limit holds for such transients in globular clusters , the _ chandra _  observations provide a complete census of the quiescent transients in the observed four clusters , since none of the unclassified sources has an x - ray luminosity in excess of this threshold .",
    "if the number of quiescent soft x - ray transients scales with the collision frequency , we estimate that one such system is formed per @xmath130 of our normalized encounter frequencies , in which case the numbers of two , one , and zero in 47  tuc , @xmath6  cen , and ngc  6752 are well within expectation with poisson statistics .",
    "the possible presence of such a source in ngc  6397 , however , is somewhat surprising . a similar statement",
    "may be made for the x - ray detected msps : for an expected number of one per ten normalized encounter frequencies , only ngc  6397 is surprising in containing one .",
    "the presence of both a soft x - ray transient and an x - ray detected msp in ngc  6397 suggests that clusters with the highest densities contain more such systems than indicated by the ( average ) collision number .",
    "this may be the consequence of more pronounced mass segregation in these clusters , which enhances the encounter rate of neutron stars with respect to the average encounter rate by concentrating them to the core .",
    "the relative numbers of cataclysmic variables and binaries with a neutron star ( i.e. , permanently bright low - mass x - ray binaries or soft x - ray transients ) according to theory depends on a number of factors including the retention fraction of neutron stars ( many neutron stars may be born with velocities that throw them out of the cluster , whereas all white dwarfs remain ) , the mass segregation in the cluster ( which will concentrate the remaining neutron stars to the core where the close encounters occur , more so than the less massive white dwarfs ) , and the importance of primordial binaries evolving into cataclysmic binaries ( important in clusters with small encounter frequencies ) .",
    "it is therefore interesting to see that the number ratio of ( hitherto classified ) cataclysmic variables to soft x - ray transients is not significantly different in 47  tuc and ngc  6397 , even though their encounter frequencies differ by two orders of magnitude .",
    "if many of the unclassified sources in 47  tuc turn out to be cataclysmic variables , as is expected , the number ratio of cataclysmic variables to soft x - ray transients in it will even be higher .",
    "this again suggests that the average collision number of ngc  6397 underestimates the neutron star encounter rate .",
    "it should be noted that the census of cataclysmic variables through x - rays is certainly not complete , as many cataclysmic variables observed in the galactic disk have x - ray luminosities below our threshold of @xmath65  ( see e.g.  fig .  8 in verbunt et al .",
    "if we accept that x9/v1 and x19/v2 in 47  tuc and cx6 in ngc  6752 are indeed cataclysmic variables , we see from fig .  [",
    "fig : xrayopt ] that their x - ray to optical flux ratio is higher than that of any cataclysmic variable in the galactic disk studied by @xcite .",
    "the high x - ray luminosity of x9 has been confirmed with chandra observations ; the relative hardness of its x - ray spectrum suggests a cataclysmic variable , rather than a quiescent soft x - ray transient @xcite    equally remarkable is the fact that the number ratios of cataclysmic variables to x - ray active binaries is @xmath66 in all four clusters under discussion , notwithstanding the large range of encounter frequencies . in dense clusters like 47  tuc , most cataclysmic variables should be formed via close encounters , whereas a less concentrated cluster like @xmath6  cen may have a significant contribution of primordial binaries evolved into cataclysmic variables @xcite . as more sources are identified in 47  tuc and @xmath6  cen , and other clusters",
    "are studied as well , the numbers may become big enough to allow more definite conclusions .",
    "finally , we are struck by the fact that all x - ray sources in fig .",
    "[ fig : xraycenter ] lie in a quadrant south of the cluster center .",
    "the formal probability of this happening with thirteen sources is small , but , if the optical cluster center position is accurate , we are inclined to ascribe this to chance . at the small interstellar absorption towards ngc  6752 , and with the relatively hard spectra of the x - ray sources , differential absorption over the cluster can not explain the asymmetry .",
    "the optical cluster center would have to be in error by about 10  for it to be close to the x - ray center .",
    "we note that , if this is the case , then ngc  6752 becomes the second globular cluster for which the optical determination of its center has been corrected by an x - ray observation ( the first one being ngc  6541 , see fig .  1 of verbunt 2001 ) .",
