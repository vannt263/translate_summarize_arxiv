    "5 where we have used only one trajectory .",
    "it is to be noted that the last figure shows the attractor generated by one trajectory whereas fig.8 shows the approximate density of the attractor .",
    "the above method allows to obtain the statistical distribution of synchronized spikes .",
    "recall that the variable @xmath166 is spiking if and only if @xmath167 and @xmath168 is spiking if and only if @xmath169 , and no one is spiking if @xmath170 which we denote @xmath66 .",
    "recall also that the region @xmath68 corresponds to @xmath166 and @xmath168 are simultaneously spiking , which lies outside the invariant region .",
    "moreover , because @xmath171 are disjoint , @xmath166 and @xmath168 can not be simultaneously spiking .",

    "less probable transitions are : @xmath183 @xmath184 but these transition probabilities depend monotonically on the coupling @xmath39 .",
    "thus the transitions @xmath185 and @xmath186 ( i.e. successive spikes ) decreases slightly with coupling .",
    "so , strengthening the coupling in this range decreases the bursting probability .",
    "we can understand these occurrences in considering the intersections of the image of each region by @xmath35 with these same regions ( see fig .",

    "the positive lebesgue measure of these intersected regions give the transition probabilities of each of these occurrences .",
    "some of the transition probabilities given by the calculation of the lebesgue measures of the intersected regions are shown in fig .",
    "11 , with their dependance over the coupling constant @xmath39 , which can be compared to those obtained numerically in the table fig .",
    "all the calculations are made in appendix a , where we also show that , when the parameters are in @xmath105,a neuron can not fire twice , i.e. @xmath195 .     of the partitions of the invariant region @xmath86 . ]    ; @xmath124 . ]",
    "we can now check the memory effects in studying the conditional probability of a state given the past .",

    "there is no memory of the process . in order to compute the above conditional probability we have to find @xmath200 which implies @xmath201 calculations .",
    "but , neglecting rare events like @xmath202 having @xmath203 probability for @xmath165 , we have only @xmath104 significant transitions .",
    "@xmath204        the first one is the probability of having @xmath205 if it is preceded by a sequence of @xmath205 and @xmath206 and for the others the definition is the same .",
    "thus we obtain the following table ( fig.12 ) . the fact that the probability @xmath207 is not equal to @xmath208 means that the system has acquired a memory , the chain is not a markov chain .",
    "the memory of a chain is given by the smallest positive integer @xmath209 such that : @xmath210 .    it is also remarkable that the probability of having @xmath176 if it is preceded by the sequence @xmath211 is @xmath212 the double of the probability of having @xmath176 preceded by @xmath206 simply @xmath213 .",
    "this explain the frequent appearance of sequence of spikes .",
    "how could we estimate the memory of the process depends on the full calculation of all conditional probabilities for all past .",
    "another very interesting aspect is the dependence of this memory on the coupling coefficient as shown in fig .",
    "it is clear that the memory effects increase with coupling ( the distance between the two curves increases with coupling ) .    .",
    "we have investigated chaotic dynamics of two coupled maps each formally derived from fitzhugh - nagumo model of neuron excitability .",

    "the excitation threshold is given by the discontinuity point .",
    "we have introduced the formal definition of spike if the map evolves above this threshold .",
    "the linear `` diffusive '' coupling term introduced for the maps can be treated as a kind of electrical inter - neuron coupling that mimics an `` integral '' coupling current between the two cells .",
    "we have shown that increasing the coupling coefficient above certain threshold leads to the appearance of chaotic attractor .",
    "the attractor appears in the invariant region of the phase space confined by the invariant manifolds of saddle periodic orbit .",
    "this region attracts trajectories from outside and does not contain any stable trajectory inside .",
    "the oscillations emerging with such an attractor have a spike - burst shape with synchronous bursts with anti - phase spiking . using probabilistic description",

    "<S> the dynamics of two coupled piece - wise linear one - dimensional monostable maps is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the single map is associated with poincar section of the fitzhugh - nagumo neuron model . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that a diffusive coupling leads to the appearance of chaotic attractor . </S>",
    "<S> the attractor exists in an invariant region of phase space bounded by the manifolds of the saddle fixed point and the saddle periodic point . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillations from the chaotic attractor have a spike - burst shape with anti - phase synchronized spiking .    </S>",
    "<S> * spiking - bursting activity is a common feature of the temporal organization in many neural firing patterns @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> bursting activity means that clusters of spikes ( of action potentials ) occur more or less rhythmically and separated by phases of quiescence . </S>",
    "<S> spiking - bursting dynamics can be regular or chaotic depending on the concentration of neuromodulators , currents and other control parameters . </S>",
    "<S> for example , many of the talamocortical neurons from central patterns generators generate chaotic spiking - bursting dynamics . in order to understand the emergence of chaotic oscillations in a neurones network , we use a two variables fitzhugh - nagumo model of the membrane potential of an isolated neural cell . for appropriate values of the parameters , </S>",
    "<S> the system possesses a stable fixed point a focus surrounded by a separatrix such that for large enough perturbations , the system responds by an excitation pulse which also decays to the stable focus . </S>",
    "<S> hence , introducing a section by a half - line , we obtain a one - dimensional piece - wise smooth map with one discontinuity point representing the excitation threshold . </S>",
    "<S> then we consider a difference coupling between two such maps . in the linear approximation of the maps and for suitable values of the parameters , </S>",
    "<S> this two - dimensional system is locally hyperbolic having discontinuity lines and a strange attractor . </S>",
    "<S> the interesting fact is that these lines define regions in the phase space corresponding to the thresholds of excitability of each one of these neurones , or none of them . </S>",
    "<S> the symbolic dynamics represents then the bursting activity of the neurones . </S>",
    "<S> it is then possible to apply the approximation tools of statistical analysis of time series generated by the system , namely through perron - frobenius operator , in order to study and interpret some important features of neural networks , like synchronization and time correlations . * </S>"
