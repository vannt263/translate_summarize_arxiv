    "the ` standard model ' of extragalactic classical double radio sources by scheuer ( 1974 ) explains these sources as twin jets emerging from the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) and impinging on the surrounding gas .",
    "the compact , high surface brightness regions or hot spots at the end of the jets are interpreted as the sites of the interaction between the jets and the environment . after passing through the hot spot region",
    ", the jet material inflates the radio lobes or cocoon which is observed as diffuse emission in between the hot spots and the source core ( e.g. muxlow & garrington 1991 and references therein ) .",
    "this picture forms the basis of virtually all more recent attempts at modeling the dynamics and radio emission properties of powerful radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars ( begelman & cioffi 1989 , falle 1991 , daly 1994 , nath 1995 , kaiser & alexander 1997 , chyy 1997 , kaiser et al .",

    "these models for the evolution of individual classical doubles or frii - type objects ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) can be used to study the cosmological evolution of the population as a whole .",
    "one of the more important trends is the apparent decrease of the mean linear size of the radio structures with increasing redshift ( see neeser et al .",
    "1995 and references therein ) .",
    "two recent attempts in fully explaining the linear size  redshift anti - correlation were presented by blundell et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and kaiser & alexander ( 1999a ) .",
    "blundell et al .",
    "argue that a specific form of pre - aging of the relativistic particle population in the hot spots in connection with the lower flux limit of complete observed samples causes this anti - correlation ( the so - called youth - redshift degeneracy , blundell et al . 1999 , blundell & rawlings 1999 ) .",
    "alternatively , kaiser & alexander propose that the apparent smaller sizes of radio sources at high redshift could be caused by a denser environment of these objects at high redshift . clearly , the evolution or non - evolution of the radio source environments is of great interest to decide this and other important cosmological questions .",
    "various methods have been employed in determining the properties of the radio source environments .",
    "x - ray observations of the hot gas around radio sources in clusters yield direct estimates of the gas density ( crawford et al . 1999 , hardcastle & worrall 1999 ) .",
    "however , such studies are at present confined to objects at low redshifts .",
    "furthermore , the agn ( e.g. sambruna et al . 1999 ) and the large - scale radio structure contribute to the x - ray emission ( brunetti et al . 1999 , kaiser & alexander 1999b , sect .",
    "[ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "the properties of the density distribution inferred from x - ray observations may therefore be considerably influenced by the presence of the radio source itself .",
    "faraday rotation of the polarisation angle of the synchrotron emission and the related depolarisation can be used to determine the gas density of the material surrounding the radio lobes ( e.g. garrington et al .",
    "1988 , laing 1988 ) .",
    "unfortunately , this method does not provide a direct measure of the gas density as the rotation measure also depends on the strength of the magnetic field in the source environment .",
    "usually it is not possible to break this degeneracy because the strength of the magnetic field is only poorly known .",
    "constraints on the density of the radio source environments also come from optical or infrared galaxy counts around the host galaxies ( e.g. hill & lilly 1991 ) .",
    "it is not straightforward to decide whether galaxies in the field of the radio source host are associated or chance background objects . resolving the ambiguity",
    "would ideally require the spectroscopic measurement of the redshifts of all objects in question .",
    "this is very time consuming . in any case",
    ", the method provides only indirect constraints on the gas density around the radio source as this has to be inferred from comparison with low redshift clusters or groups of similar richness .",
    "the ages of powerful radio sources can in principle be determined from their radio spectrum ( e.g. alexander & leahy 1987 ) .",
    "the various energy losses of the relativistic particles depend on time and so the shape of the radio spectrum contains an encoded history of the source . in practice the time - dependence of the energy losses complicates the estimation of the spectral age because different parts of the source have different ages .",
    "even when radio maps at various frequencies which fully resolve the radio lobes are used , it is difficult to disentangle the effects of the various loss mechanisms and possible bulk backflow of the cocoon material along the jet ( e.g. rudnick et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the model developed in this paper aims at tracing the individual evolution of parts of the cocoon and thereby providing more accurate estimates for the source age . at the same time",
    "the model also constrains the density in the source environment and other parameters like the energy transport rate of the jets .",
    "it is solely based on radio observations which are available for a large number of objects , even at high redshift .",

    "the age of extragalactic radio sources can be estimated by the use of spectral aging arguments .",
    "this method relies on the determination of the break in the radio spectrum caused by the time - dependent energy losses of the relativistic electrons within the cocoon ( e.g. alexander & leahy 1987 ) . at frequencies higher than the break frequency",
    ", @xmath4 , the spectrum significantly steepens due to the radiative energy losses of the electrons .",
    "the spectral age of a electron population , @xmath5 , with observed break frequency @xmath6 within a magnetic field of strength @xmath7 which does not vary in time is proportional to @xmath8 . despite the implication of source dynamics that the magnetic field does vary in time ,",
    "the constant field relation is usually used in determining the spectral age of a given source . in general",
    "the strength of the magnetic field will decrease while the source expands and so @xmath9 will be an overestimate of the true source age , @xmath10 . however , because of variations of the magnetic field in the cocoon and the backflow of gas in this region , @xmath5 is usually found to be lower than the dynamical ages inferred from the advance speed of the cocoon by various methods ( alexander & leahy 1987 ) .    the model presented in the following can be viewed as an extension of the spectral aging formalism . within the cocoon it traces the evolution of the local magnetic field in time .",
    "this allows the accurate determination of the energy distribution function of the relativistic particle population and thus the emitted spectrum at a given location along the cocoon .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the model predicts an older age for cygnus a ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : compa ] ) than the classical spectral index analysis of carilli et al .",
    "the combination of a dynamical model with the accurate treatment of the local evolution within the cocoon of the radio emission properties implies that the spectral and dynamical ages are identical .      in the context of spectral aging methods",
    "other processes changing the energy distribution of the relativistic electrons and thus invalidating the age estimates have been put forward .",
    "these are summarised and discussed by blundell & rawlings ( 2000 ) .",
    "they show that most of these processes are rather inefficient and will not strongly influence spectral aging methods or the model discussed here .",
    "however , blundell & rawlings ( 2000 ) claim that the anomalous diffusion mechanism of rechester & rosenbluth ( 1978 ) can lead to very fast diffusion of relativistic particles through the tangled magnetic field in the cocoon .",
    "so much so that the radio spectra observed at any point along the cocoon essentially arise from the electrons accelerated by the jet shock at the hot spot within the last @xmath11 years of the observation .",
    "this would imply that no information on the source age can be derived from the spatial properties of the observed emission .",
    "support for a universal particle energy spectrum may come from the interpretation of observations of cygnus a by katz - stone et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , rudnick et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and katz - stone & rudnick ( 1994 ) .",
    "they find that a single , non - power law spectrum shifted in frequency by the local strength of the magnetic field is emitted by all parts of the lobes of cygnus a. note however , that the spectral shape they find may be caused by the free - free absorption in our own galaxy of the emission of cygnus a at low frequencies ( carilli et al .",
    "1991 . in this case , the universal spectrum is simply explained by shifting an aging energy spectrum of relativistic particles which is not a single power law .",
    "alternatively , changes in the strength of the magnetic field along a given line of sight may also introduce additional curvature in the observed spectrum ( rudnick et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the mentioned interpretation of the radio observations of cygnus a in itself is therefore no proof of efficient diffusion acting in the lobes of radio galaxies .    in the appendix",
    "i show that anomalous diffusion is probably much less effective in the cocoon plasma as previously thought .",
    "in general we do not observe any signature for diffusion losses of the cocoons of radio sources and so diffusion will not alter the distribution of relativistic particles within the cocoon .",
    "this allows us to use the spatial distribution of the synchrotron radio emission of frii sources to infer their age .",
    "the model developed in the following can be viewed as an extension to the classical spectral aging methods in that it takes into account the evolution of the magnetic field in the lobe .",
    "in this sect .",
    "i briefly summarise the dynamical and radiative model that form the basis for the extended treatment presented in this paper . following this",
    "the prescription for the spatial distribution of the synchrotron emission within the radio lobes is developed .",
    "the large scale structure of radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars of type frii is formed by twin jets emanating from the central agn buried inside the nucleus of the host galaxy .",
    "the jets propagate into opposite directions from the core of the source .",
    "they end in strong jet shocks and , after passing through these shock , the jet material inflates the cocoon surrounding the jets .",
    "the cocoon is overpressured with respect to the ambient medium and therefore drives strong bow shocks into this material .",
    "falle ( 1991 ) and ka showed that the expansion of the bow shock and the cocoon should be self - similar which is supported by observations ( e.g. leahy & williams 1984 , leahy et al .",
    "1989 , black 1992 ) . in these models",
    "the density distribution of the material the radio source is expanding into is approximated by a power law , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the radial distance from the source centre and @xmath14 is the core radius of the density distribution .",
    "x - ray observations of groups and clusters of galaxies show that the density of the hot gas in these structures is often distributed according to ( e.g. sarazin 1988 )    @xmath15 ^{3\\beta ' /2}}. \\label{king}\\ ] ]    outside a few core radii , @xmath16 , the power law assumed above with @xmath17 provides an adequate fit to eq .",

    "@xmath13 good power law approximations can be found by adjusting @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( e.g. kaiser & alexander 1999a ) .    in the model of ka",
    "it is also assumed that the rate at which energy is transported along each jet , @xmath20 , is constant and that the jets are in pressure equilibrium with their own cocoon . the very high sound speed within the cocoon results in a practically uniform pressure within this region apart from the tip of the cocoon .",
    "the pressure in this ` hot spot ' region , named for the very strong radio emission originating in the shock at the end of the jets , is somewhat higher as the cocoon material injected by the jets at these points is not yet in pressure equilibrium with the rest of the cocoon .    in the following i",
    "will concentrate on only one jet and the half of the cocoon it is contained in . from ka",
    "i take the expressions for the evolution of the uniform cocoon pressure ,    @xmath21    and that of the physical length of the jet ,    @xmath22    here , @xmath23 is the ratio of specific heats of the gas surrounding the radio source , @xmath24 is the age of the jet flow and @xmath25 is a dimensionless constant .",

    "adiabatic losses only change the normalisation of the emitted spectrum while its slope at a given frequency is governed by the radiative loss processes of the relativistic electrons . in the model described above the strength of the magnetic field which determines the magnitude of synchrotron losses",
    "is tied to the pressure in the cocoon , @xmath27 .",
    "the value of @xmath27 in turn depends on the energy transport rate of the jet , @xmath20 , and a combination of parameters describing the density distribution of the gas the cocoon is expanding into , @xmath77 . in the analytical scenario presented here",

    "for this i now identify the cocoon volume elements @xmath28 with infinitesimally thin cylindrical slices with their radius , @xmath78 , perpendicular to the jet axis .",
    "a similar approach is used in the model of chyy ( 1997 ) . however , in this model the dynamical evolution and the radio luminosity of the entire cocoon depend on the geometrical shape and evolution of the volume elements . in the model of ka and kda",

    "before the environment properties can be extracted , the bright x - ray emission of the agn itself appearing as a point source must be carefully removed . in the case of radio - loud objects the large scale structure caused by the jets",

    "the more extended cocoon material itself may also act as a scatterer of cmb photons or of agn emission ( brunetti et al .",

    "a this implies that roughly 2% of all counts of the rosat observations presented by hardcastle & worrall ( 2000 ) attributed to the entire extended emission come from the layer of shocked gas in between bow shock and cocoon of this source . for 3c 219 this region around the southern lobe alone",
    "contributes about 10% of the relevant counts .",
    "the contribution of the northern lobe of 3c 215 is negligible ( @xmath351% ) .",

    "helsdon & ponman ( 2000 ) show for the case of loose groups of galaxies that such an overestimate at the centre of an x - ray surface brightness profile may lead to overestimates of the core radius and also of @xmath352 when fitted with a @xmath0-model . using these overestimated values of @xmath16 and @xmath0 then yields values for @xmath353 which are too low compared to the ` real ' central density .",

    "in the model it will be assumed that the magnetic field within the cocoon is completely tangled on a scale @xmath355 much smaller than the size of the cocoon , @xmath356 . in this case",
    "the relativistic electrons can diffuse quickly within ` patches ' of coherent magnetic field of a size @xmath355 .",
    "however , it is difficult for them to escape their patch as this would involve diffusion perpendicular to field lines . in the presence of turbulent motion within the plasma underlying the magnetic field ,",
    "patches can be stretched out and in this case the diffusion of charged particles into an adjacent patch becomes more likely .",
    "duffy et al . ( 1995 ) calculate how far a given electrons has to travel along a field line in its original patch before the patch becomes so stretched out that it can escape .",
    "note here that this treatment is valid only in the quasi - linear regime for which the relative amplitude of irregularities of the magnetic field is much smaller than the ratio of the turbulent correlation lengths perpendicular and parallel to the local magnetic field .",
    "the efficiency of this diffusion then depends crucially on whether the electron is able to travel this distance ballistically or whether it must diffuse along the field line .",
    "the more efficient ballistic regime requires that      where @xmath358 is the gyro - radius of the particle in the field , @xmath359 is the diffusion coefficient perpendicular to the field and @xmath360 is the time it takes the particle to escape the patch . for a relativistic electron moving at speed @xmath361 and corresponding lorentz factor",
    "@xmath362 following chuvilgin & ptuskin ( 1993 ) @xmath363 with @xmath364 the bohm diffusion coefficient and @xmath365 , where @xmath366 is the rate of collision of the particle and @xmath367 is its gyro - frequency .",
    "for the assumption of blundell & rawlings ( 2000 ) that the coherence length of the magnetic field is roughly 10 kpc in all directions , the inequality ( [ ineql ] ) yields @xmath368 for a magnetic field strength of 130 @xmath187 g , appropriate for the fiducial model of sect .",
    "[ sec : degen ] , and an electron with a lorentz factor 1000 .",
    "this implies that the time between collisions of this electron must be greater than 2 myr , i.e. the mean free path of the electron is of order 600 kpc .",
    "this is clearly unphysical in the case of @xmath369 kpc as relativistic particles would then simply escape the cocoon very quickly .",
    "the relativistic electrons in the cocoon must therefore diffuse along the magnetic field lines in between jumps from one patch of coherent magnetic field to another .",
    "the expression of duffy et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for the rms diffusion length after a time @xmath10 , @xmath344 , in this case can be approximated by      assuming that the mean free path of the electron is less than the coherence length of the magnetic field , i.e. less than 10 kpc , i find for the same magnetic field and lorentz factor @xmath371 kpc if @xmath372 myr .",
    "a significant mixing of relativistic particles along the cocoon due to anomalous diffusion is therefore unlikely .",
    "of course , it may be argued that as the above analysis only applies to the quasi - linear regime , the diffusion timescale in a highly turbulent flow may be much shorter .",
    "consider such a flow to be present in the cocoons of frii - type radio sources . in this case",
    ", the relativistic electrons may diffuse through the observed lobes within a time short compared to the age of the source .",
    "however , since diffusion is a stochastic process and the geometry of the cocoon is elongated , most of the particles will leave the cocoon sideways and will be lost to the surrounding gas before traveling large distances along the cocoon .",
    "it is likely that the diffusion time for the relativistic particles depends on their energy and so the diffusion losses , if present , will significantly change the emission spectrum which is not observed ( e.g. roland et al",
    "even in the case of efficient energy independent diffusion the observed radio lobes should show diffuse edges in low frequency radio maps .",
    "again this is not observed ( e.g. roland et al .",
    "1990 , blundell et al .",
    "2000a , b ) .    from the above it is clear that in the presence of very efficient diffusion some special confinement mechanism for the relativistic particles in the cocoon preventing their escape sideways is needed .",
    "this may be provided for by the compression and shearing of the tangled magnetic field at the edges of the cocoon .",
    "this process will align the magnetic field close to the cocoon edge with this surface and therefore act as a kind of magnetic bottle .",
    "the order thus introduced in the originally tangled magnetic field due to this process leads to an enhanced polarisation of the emitted radiation in this region ( e.g. laing 1980 ) .",
    "large volume compression ratios are ruled out as the sound speed in the cocoon is high ( e.g. ka ) .",
    "however , for a conservative estimate consider a volume compression ratio of 10 in the sheet of compressed material at the edge of the cocoon of a given source .",
    "this already implies that the maximum theoretical value of polarisation of the synchrotron emission should be observed at the edge of the radio lobes ( hughes & miller 1991 ) . for adiabatic compression of a tangled magnetic field the strength of the field increases by a factor of roughly 4.6 .",
    "the rate of collisions of a given particle is probably increased as well as the irregularities in the magnetic field are also compressed .",
    "however , the case of @xmath373 provides for a lower limit of @xmath374 and so with @xmath375 it is clear that the diffusion coefficient within the compressed region perpendicular to the field lines decreases by a factor 25 at most compared to the inner cocoon .",
    "this implies that in a given time a relativistic particle diffuses a 5 times shorter distance in the compressed boundary layer compared to the inner regions of the cocoon . to significantly influence the time the particle remains in the cocoon this compressed layer must at the very least occupy 20% of the width of the cocoon which is unlikely .",
    "note , that although the magnetic field is compressed in the boundary layer and therefore aligned with the cocoon surface some field lines may still be perpendicular to this surface . along these field lines diffusion will be even faster allowing many electrons to escape the cocoon .",
    "from this i conclude that diffusion , even if it is highly effective in the inner cocoon and there exists a compressed boundary layer along the edges of the cocoon , will not alter the distribution of relativistic particles within the cocoon .",
    "this allows us to use the spatial distribution of the synchrotron radio emission of frii sources to infer their age .",
    "the model developed in the following can be viewed as an extension to the classical spectral aging methods in that it takes into account the evolution of the magnetic field in the lobe"
