    "the substructure of @xmath15 has been the object of intense recent study due to its relevance to ckm physics @xcite , but there is currently relatively little information on the substructure of @xmath16 . a 1993 cleo ii publication based on 206 events found the branching fraction of the decay chain @xmath17 to be @xmath18 and the branching fraction of the non - resonant contribution to be @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the total @xmath16 branching fraction has recently been measured by the cleo collaboration to be @xmath20 in an analysis that used @xmath21 of data at @xmath22 gev @xcite .",
    "the pursuit of a more comprehensive study of the substructure of @xmath16 is motivated in part by the fact that this mode should provide a cleaner way to investigate the @xmath23 s - wave substructure observed in @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "analyses performed by both babar and belle use eight @xmath23 resonances , four of which are spin - zero ( including two distinct @xmath9 resonances ) , to fit the @xmath15 dalitz plot , but the @xmath23 s - wave components in these analyses are masked by the very sizeable p - wave contributions of the @xmath24 resonance . by studying @xmath25 we eliminate final states involving @xmath24 mesons and expect any s - wave structure present in the decay to be more prominent .",
    "we have analyzed @xmath26 of @xmath27 collisions produced with the cornell electron storage ring at the center - of - mass energy of the @xmath28 resonance , resulting in about three million @xmath29 pairs produced in the cleo - c detector .",
    "we consider candidates where the @xmath30 is reconstructed as @xmath25 , and the @xmath31 is reconstructed in the following four tag modes : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 ( charge congugation is implied throughout this paper unless explicitly stated ) .",
    "reconstructing any of these modes , whether it be signal or tag , involves placing requirements on the beam - constrained mass @xmath36 and the energy difference @xmath37 , defined as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is one - half of the center - of - mass energy of the colliding beams , and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) is the total reconstructed energy ( momentum ) of the candidate .",
    "both of these quantities rely on the fact that @xmath40 would be the same as @xmath39 if the event were perfectly reconstructed , and are required to be within 2.5 ( 3.5 ) standard deviations of their nominal values for @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : de ] shows the @xmath37 distributions for tagged @xmath16 candidates that pass all other selection criteria .",
    "the solid line shows the results of fitting with a double gaussian to represent the signal plus a constant background ( horizontal dashed line ) .",
    "the vertical dashed lines indicate the signal region.,width=288 ]    we reconstruct neutral pions using photons with @xmath42 and @xmath43 within 3 standard deviations ( 15 @xmath44 ) of the nominal @xmath45 mass  @xcite .",
    "we reconstruct @xmath46 with @xmath47 within 2.5 standard deviations ( 6 @xmath44 ) of the nominal @xmath48 mass  @xcite and with the @xmath49 vertex displaced from the interaction point by at least twice the error on their separation . when there are multiple @xmath16 candidates in a single event we select the one with the highest joint probability that both neutral pions are correctly identified .",
    "after all selection requirements are imposed on both signal and tag - side candidates we obtain a combined sample of 1,259 tagged @xmath16 events . a dalitz plot of these candidates is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dp2zy ] .",
    "bose symmetry requires that the decay dynamics remain invariant when the two @xmath45 s are swapped , hence the dalitz plot contains two entries per event , one for each possible @xmath50 combination .",
    "the horizontal band evident at around @xmath51 is due to @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) , and the most striking vertical feature is an empty band at around @xmath54 where the @xmath55 threshold opens , indicating the presence of destructive interference between the @xmath56 and some broad underlying @xmath23 s - wave structure .",
    "a study of events both inside and outside the signal region indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : de ] shows that @xmath57 of the events in this dalitz plot are background .",
    "dalitz plot showing two entries per candidate , one for each possible @xmath50 combination.,width=288 ]    we determine the efficiency of our analysis as a function of dalitz plot coordinate by using a geant - based monte carlo package to generate 1,000,000 simulated @xmath29 pairs where one @xmath58 is forced to decay to a flavor - tagging mode in proportion to its branching fraction while the other @xmath58 decays to @xmath25 uniformly across the dalitz plot .",
    "we pass these events through the same analysis code and selection requirements as the data , and fit the dalitz plot of the remaining 63,391 events to a cubic polynomial which has been explicitly symmetrized in the two @xmath59 variables .",
    "we find that the efficiency is well modeled by this simple function and is uniform across the dalitz plot .    to study backgrounds we use a monte carlo - generated sample of @xmath29 events corresponding to twenty times the actual integrated luminosity in which the @xmath58 s decay to all experimentally measured final states with appropriate branching fractions , removing all events that contain an actual @xmath16 decay and subjecting the remaining events to the same analysis requirements as the real data .",
    "the remaining background events vary smoothly across the dalitz plot , preferring the corners of phase space where a @xmath45 is produced at rest and is more easily faked .",
    "we find the background shape is well modeled by a symmetrized third - order polynomial combined with a small breit - wigner component to account for @xmath60 decays from the background mode @xmath61 where the @xmath60 decay combines with an unrelated calorimeter shower to yield a second @xmath45 candidate .",
    "the fitting method used to explore the efficiency and background shapes , as well as the structure of the @xmath16 signal , uses the same unbinned maximum likelihood technique described in ref .",
    "@xcite which minimizes the sum over n events : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the two @xmath59 dalitz variables and @xmath65 is the probability density function ( p.d.f . ) which depends on the event sample being fit : @xmath66 the signal p.d.f .",
    "is proportional to the matrix element squared , @xmath67 , corrected by the measured efficiency @xmath68 and the signal fraction , @xmath69 , which is simply the complement of the background fraction discussed above , and is fixed in the fit . the efficiency , signal , and background contributions are normalized separately : @xmath70 providing the overall normalization @xmath71 .",
    "several models for fitting the data have been explored , and three of these are described here .",
    "all include the @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 as intermediate @xmath50 resonances and an @xmath75 intermediate @xmath76 resonance . to model the s - wave contribution to @xmath76 we add an @xmath56 , described with a flatt parameterization @xcite , to a @xmath23 complex pole around the mass of the @xmath77 , and we include one of the following three variations : @xmath78 ( model 1 ) , @xmath79 ( model 2 ) , and both @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( model 3 ) .",
    "each includes a non - interfering @xmath80 contribution to account for @xmath81 .",
    "a fourth model , in which the broadest s - wave features were replaced by a simple non - resonant component , was rejected since the fit fraction of the non - resonant component exceeded @xmath82% .",
