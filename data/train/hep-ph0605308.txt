    "the measurement of the leptonic cp phase is one of the most important aims in elementary particle physics .",
    "a lot of investigations for this possibility have been performed , see @xcite and the references therein . in most of these investigations , @xmath8 or @xmath9 oscillations ( so - called golden channel @xcite ) are used for the measurement of @xmath1 and @xmath10 oscillations ( silver channel @xcite ) are also used partly .",
    "however , there are also @xmath0 oscillations as another channel observed in long baseline experiments .",
    "the measurement of @xmath1 in this channel have been considered to be difficult because the probability @xmath11 depends almost only on the @xmath12 term and the cp dependence disappears in the case of @xmath13 and @xmath14 . however , some recent papers discuss the possibility of solving the parameter ambiguity by using this channel @xcite . in these analysis ,",
    "the cp dependence becomes small and the confirmation of @xmath1 seems to be difficult in actual experiments .",
    "however , if the cp dependence becomes large in this channel , this analysis is very useful , interesting and cost - effective because the probability of this channel can be measured at the same time as @xmath9 probability without any extra apparatus and we can obtain another information on the cp phase in superbeam experiments . in quark sector , the cp violation was discovered in k physics , but the determination of the cp phase can not be performed by the increase of the data in k physics and needed the b - factory experiments @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the cp phase in two different channels is considered to be very important also for the lepton sector .",
    "we obtain the information with a different nature by using different channels .",
    "furthermore , this opens the window for a verification of the unitarity in three generation and exploration of new physics .    in the previous paper",
    ", we introduced a new index of the leptonic cp phase dependence @xmath15 and investigated how the information of @xmath1 can be obtained through the channel of @xmath9 oscillation @xcite . in this letter , we use @xmath15 for the channel of @xmath0 oscillation and explore the region in @xmath16-@xmath17 plane where the cp dependence becomes large .",
    "we consider one baseline in this region and investigate the contribution of the cp phase to @xmath0 oscillations in detail .",
    "finally , we simulate both @xmath7 and @xmath6 events by using an experimental setup and compare the analysis of @xmath6 events alone with the combined analysis of @xmath7 and @xmath6 events .",
    "at first , we write the hamiltonian in matter @xcite as @xmath18 by factoring out @xmath19 and @xmath1 , where @xmath20 is the rotation matrix in the 2 - 3 generations and @xmath21 is the phase matrix defined by @xmath22 .",
    "the reduced hamiltonian @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the fermi constant , @xmath28 is the electron number density , @xmath29 is the electron fraction , @xmath16 is neutrino energy and @xmath30 is the mass of @xmath31 .",
    "the oscillation probability for @xmath0 is proportional to the @xmath12 and @xmath32 in constant matter profile @xcite and can be expressed as @xmath33 here , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are determined by parameters other than @xmath1 and are calculated by @xmath37c_{23}s_{23 } \\label{eq a } , \\\\ c&=&|s_{\\mu\\mu}^{\\prime}|^2c_{23}^4+|s_{\\tau\\tau}^{\\prime}|^2s_{23}^4 \\\\ & & + 2(|s_{\\mu\\tau}^{\\prime}|^2+{\\rm re}[s_{\\mu\\mu}^{\\prime * } s_{\\tau\\tau}^{\\prime } ] ) c_{23}^2s_{23}^2 \\label{eq c } , \\\\",

    "the coefficient @xmath34 coincides with @xmath40 , which is the coefficient of @xmath12 in the @xmath9 oscillation probability , except for the sign @xcite .",
    "namely , @xmath34 is simplified as @xmath41 . \\label{exacta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we notice the small parameters , @xmath42 and @xmath43 and count the order of coefficients , we obtain @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , this leads to the relation @xmath47 and we can safely neglect the term including @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "next , we introduce @xmath15 following @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath48 and @xmath49 as the maximal and minimal values when @xmath1 changes from @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "then , @xmath15 is defined by @xmath52 also in @xmath0 oscillation . as the coefficient @xmath36",
    "can be neglected , @xmath11 is approximated by @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath49 correspond to the two end points .",
    "namely , the maximal and minimal values are given by @xmath54 or @xmath55 corresponding to @xmath56 or @xmath57 .",
    "so , we obtain @xmath58 next , let us present the region with large @xmath15 in @xmath16-@xmath17 plane .",
    "in order to exclude the region with large @xmath15 due to the small denominator , we also show the region with large @xmath59 , which is the numerator of @xmath15 . in fig.1",
    ", we assume @xmath60 , which is near the upper bound of the chooz experiment @xcite , and can be measured in the next generation reactor experiments @xcite . if @xmath61 will be determined by this method without ambiguity , we can take a large step for the measurement of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we use the best - fit values @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 @xcite for other parameters .",
    "we calculate by using the matter density @xmath66g/@xmath67 . in fig.1 ,",
    "black color shows the region with @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively in left and right figures .",
    "comparing the two figures , we can see that the region with large @xmath70 does not overlap that with large @xmath59 above @xmath71 gev .",
    "this means that the region of large @xmath15 above @xmath71 gev just indicates the region where the denominator is small . on the other hand",
    ", both regions overlap over wide region below @xmath71 gev .",
    "we found from fig.1 that the cp dependence in @xmath0 oscillations becomes large in the region @xmath2 gev and @xmath3 km .",
    "we choose a baseline of @xmath72 km as an example in this region and investigate the behavior of @xmath34 and @xmath11 in detail .",
    "@xcite about other baselines .",

    "simultaneous fit of @xmath73 and @xmath1 by assuming the true values , @xmath60 and @xmath13 . left and right panels are drawn assuming the measurement of @xmath6 events alone and both @xmath7 and @xmath6 events .",
    "the true values are represented by x in these figures .",
    "the statistical error is also shown as solid , dotted and dashed contours for 1,2 and 3-@xmath74 ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) respectively .",
    "comparing the left and right panels , we also found that some allowed regions are excluded by the additional measurement of @xmath7 events .",
    "another notable point is that the value of @xmath77 seems to remain unchanged even in the case for small @xmath78 .",
    "we can understand this result by the following reason .",
    "the appearance probability for @xmath7 to @xmath6 transition does not change largely because @xmath61 independent term ( the solar term ) is comparatively large in such low energy region and is not so affected by the value of @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath77 does not change largely by the decrease of @xmath61 .    here",
    ", let us emphasize again on the importance of the simultaneous utilization of the @xmath0 and @xmath9 oscillations .",
    "this provides the variable possibility for the measurement of the cp phase in future experiments .",
    "we need to investigate further , including the parameter ambiguity problem @xcite , background , systematic error and spectral dependence @xcite",

    "this setup satisfy the conditions @xmath2 gev and @xmath3 km derived in this letter and is similar to our test experimental setup , so we expect the observation of the cp phase effect also in the bnl - hs experiment in the case of large @xmath61 .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the possibility for the measurement of the cp phase @xmath1 by using @xmath0 oscillations .",
    "the measurement of @xmath1 in this channel have been considered to be difficult because the probability @xmath11 depends only on the @xmath12 term and the cp dependence disappears in the case of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we have used @xmath15 and @xmath59 ( numerator of @xmath15 ) for this channel and have found the cp phase effect becomes large in the region @xmath3 km and @xmath2 gev beyond our expectation . as a result , we have shown that the difference between the probabilities for @xmath56 and @xmath57 reaches about @xmath4 in the case of large @xmath61 .",
    "in addition , @xmath34 is almost positive definite over the region @xmath5 gev and we expect a large cp dependence in total @xmath7 events accumulated in this region . as an example",
    ", we have used an experimental setup and have demonstrated that the allowed region is limited to one by combined analysis of @xmath6 and @xmath7 events although there remain three allowed regions by the analysis of @xmath6 events alone .",
    "furthermore , this channel opens the window for a verification of the unitarity in three generation and exploration of new physics beyond the standard model .",
