    "entropy plays a central role both in thermodynamics and in information theory .",
    "this is remarkable , as the two theories appear to be fundamentally different .",
    "thermodynamics is a phenomenological theory , concerned with the description of large physical systems , such as steam engines or fridges .",
    "it relies on concepts like work or heat , which are defined in terms of macroscopic observables .",
    "information theory , on the other hand , deals with `` knowledge '' on a rather abstract level . like statistical mechanics",
    ", it refers to the microscopic states of a system , such as the values of the individual bits stored in a memory device .",
    "accordingly , the notion of entropy is rather different in the two theories . in thermodynamics",
    ", entropy is a function of the macroscopic state of a physical system which describes phenomenologically which processes are possible independently of any microscopic model .",
    "following clausius , it is conventionally defined in terms of the heat transfer into a system at a given temperature , and it lends its operational significance from the second law  @xcite . in information theory ,",
    "entropy was originally introduced by shannon to quantify the information content of data or , equivalently , the uncertainty one has about them  @xcite .",
    "operationally , it characterises properties such as the compression length , i.e.  the minimum number of bits needed to store the data .",
    "mathematically , the shannon entropy is a function of the probability distribution of the random variable that models the data .",
    "the von neumann entropy  @xcite provides a generalisation of this concept to the case where information is represented by the state of a quantum - mechanical system .    the information theoretic entropy is formally equivalent to the entropy function from statistical mechanics",
    ". this relation is conceptually justified through landauer s principle  @xcite .",
    "it entails that the loss of information in an erasure operation on a system , and hence the decrease of its information - theoretic entropy , is paired with a heat dissipation in the system s environment .",
    "arguments for landauer s principle start from microscopic considerations , for example using standard tools from statistical mechanics  @xcite , or explicit microscopic models inspired from information theory  @xcite .",
    "an alternative view on the conceptual connection of these entropy measures was proposed by jaynes in terms of his maximum entropy principle  @xcite .",
    "see also  @xcite for a selection of related approaches .    in this letter , we take a different approach : we show that the information - theoretic entropy results from applying the definition of thermodynamic entropy to quantum resource theories .",
    "this connection is not based on a model borrowed from one particular theory , instead it relates the theory of information to that of phenomenological thermodynamics on an axiomatic level .",
    "our approach relies on a framework by lieb and yngvason  @xcite , who give a derivation of thermodynamics , and in particular of the thermodynamic entropy , based on abstract axioms .",
    "these axioms identify basic properties of a thermodynamic system , which we find to be also fulfilled in the context of resource theories . as a consequence , there is also in this context a state function analogous to the thermodynamic entropy . as we show",
    ", the state function in question is none else than the information - theoretic entropy itself .",
    "this provides a novel connection between the thermodynamic and information - theoretic entropies .",
    "in particular , this connection extends to the min- and max - entropy , `` single - shot '' generalizations of the von neumann entropy .",
    "these have been introduced to characterize single instances of information - theoretic tasks  @xcite .",
    "we show that they , too , can be obtained from the same axiomatic approach as thermodynamic entropy . in order to demonstrate this",
    ", we consider an extension of lieb and yngvason s framework to nonequilibrium states  @xcite , with which these entropy measures are recovered .",
    "our work bears some resemblance to the study of entanglement theory using similar tools  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this letter is organised as follows .",
    "we start with a summary of the lieb - yngvason framework for thermodynamics . as a first technical contribution",
    ", we show that the framework is applicable to a microscopic description of thermodynamic systems by resorting to a quantum resource theory .",
    "we then show that the corresponding entropy measures defined within the framework coincide with information - theoretic entropies ( proposition  [ prop : entropies ] ) .",
    "we subsequently extend these considerations to other thermodynamic quantities such as the helmholtz free energy ( proposition  [ prop : reservoir ] ) .",

    "intuitively , if the state @xmath2 can be reached adiabatically from @xmath12 , and @xmath13 can be attained from @xmath2 , then the entropy @xmath15 is defined as the optimal @xmath8 such that the state @xmath2 can be created from @xmath16 and @xmath17 combined at a ratio @xmath18 by an adiabatic process .",
    "physically , @xmath10 corresponds to the usual thermodynamic entropy as defined by clausius via the heat @xmath19 transferred into a system at a given temperature @xmath20 in a reversible process , @xmath21 .",

    "_ equilibrium states and order relation in the microscopic picture._to apply lieb and yngvason s framework to a microscopic description of systems , as employed in information theory , we need to formally specify the various ingredients ( such as the order relation ) that the abstract framework requires .",
    "first , we identify the set of `` equilibrium states '' of an information - bearing quantum system .",
    "these are defined as the class of states represented by flat density operators , that is , operators whose non - zero eigenvalues are all equal  @xcite .",
    "they stand out due to their scalability and comparability , like the equilibrium states in the thermodynamic framework .",
    "( the term `` equilibrium '' follows lieb and yngvason s terminology . )",
    "we define the composition of states as their tensor product .",
    "this does not exclude the possibility of correlations being established between subsystems but it merely asserts that before any interaction takes place these systems are independent  @xcite . for the composition with an ancilla , this can be ensured by choosing an ancilla that has never interacted with the system before or that has been decoupled through other interactions .    the notion of an `` adiabatic process ''",
    ", in the sense of lieb and yngvason , translates to any combination of the following three quantum operations ; the order relation characterises which states can be transformed to which others via such a process :    * composition with an extra ancilla system in an equilibrium state ; * reversible and energy - preserving interaction of the system and the ancilla with a weight system  @xcite ; * removal of the ancilla system , whose final reduced state must be the same as its initial state .",
    "note that these operations are independent of the particular model used to describe the weight system .",
    "in fact , the weight system should be understood as a representative for any work storage system , which may also be modelled via a potential , as e.g.  in  @xcite .",
    "it can also be shown that the above operations are equivalent to the so - called _ noisy operations _",
    "@xcite , a quantum resource theory that plays a prominent role in information theory . in general , a resource theory is defined by restricting the set of all quantum operations to a subset , the _ allowed transformations_. given such a set of allowed transformations , the aim of a resource - theoretic analysis is now to characterise which states can be interconverted and which tasks can be achieved with these transformations . in the case of noisy operations , a state transformation from @xmath31 to @xmath33 is possible if and only if @xmath34",

    "[ prop : entropies]let states be ordered by the relation @xmath40 as described above , and let the equilibrium states be those with flat spectrum . then the unique thermodynamic entropy function @xmath10 for equilibrium states coincides with the von neumann entropy @xmath41 .",

    "in other words , quantum information theory can be viewed as an instance of thermodynamics in the sense of lieb and yngvason , and the corresponding thermodynamic entropy is precisely the information - theoretic entropy .",
    "it is natural to consider other , non - adiabatic processes within the same mathematical framework , for instance scenarios where the system is in contact with additional reservoirs . in case",
    "the system interacts with a heat bath , the equilibrium states can be taken to be the thermal states of fixed temperature @xmath20 , corresponding to the temperature of the bath , as also known from the canonical ensemble in statistical mechanics .",
    "in such a setting , the processes on the system of interest are the _ thermal operations _ , introduced in  @xcite .",
    "these consist of    * composition with an ancillary system in a thermal state relative to the heat bath at temperature @xmath20 ; * reversible and energy - conserving transformation of the system and the ancilla ; * removal of any subsystem .",

    "more generally , our approach points out the formal and conceptual parallels of phenomenological thermodynamics and quantum resource theories .",

    "@xcite and answered in the affirmative .",
    "we observe here that systems connected to an angular momentum reservoir can be included in the axiomatic framework .    as the consideration of an angular momentum reservoir",

    "the spin states are assumed to be degenerate in energy and thus decoupled from the spatial degrees of freedom , which are in equilibrium with a heat bath .",
    "the equilibrium probability for the reservoir to be in a particular state with @xmath298 particles in state @xmath516 and @xmath517 particles in state @xmath515 is @xmath518 where the parameter @xmath519 is the analogue of the inverse temperature @xmath520 encountered in the context of a heat bath . as for each value",
    "@xmath298 there are @xmath521 such reservoir states , the normalization is given as @xmath522 and has the form of a partition function for the angular momentum reservoir .",

    ", we consider a reservoir in the limit @xmath523 .",
    "the state of a system in contact with a spin angular momentum reservoir can be described by a density operator .",
    "again , we restrict our considerations to states that are block diagonal , this time in the eigenbasis of the z - component of the spin operator , denoted @xmath524 . to ensure that energy does not affect our considerations , we assume all spin - levels @xmath525 to be energetically degenerate .",
    "a system in equilibrium with the reservoir is described by a density operator of the form @xmath526 with partition function @xmath527 .",
    "( note that we include states for which only a subset of the eigenstates are populated , as long as the projection onto the corresponding subspace has this form . )",
    "the spectra of block diagonal states can be represented in terms of rescaled step functions .",

    "then the * j - rescaled step function * of @xmath31 is defined as @xmath529              as in the case of a heat bath , the rescaled majorization relation @xmath59 fulfills axioms e1 to e6 for equilibrium states and n1 and n2 for non - equilibrium states .",
    "this gives rise to a unique potential , @xmath533 for equilibrium states .",
    "for non - equilibrium states , the two quantities @xmath61 and @xmath62 provide necessary conditions as well as a sufficient condition for state transformations under the above operations .",
    "we have thus found an angular momentum based resource theory corresponding to the order relation @xmath59 , for which @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are monotones . in agreement with  @xcite",
