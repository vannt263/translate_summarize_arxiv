    "random matrix theory is a powerful tool of statistical physics @xcite with important applications in the field of quantum and wave transport in random media @xcite . a special class of random matrices are euclidean random matrices with elements @xmath0 defined with the help of some function @xmath1 : @xmath2 .",
    "here @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) are randomly chosen points in the euclidean space @xcite .",
    "euclidean random matrices appear in various physical contexts and were previously considered to interpret the ` boson peak ' in supercooled liquids @xcite or to study slow relaxation in glasses and scalar phonon localization @xcite , to cite a few recent examples .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study eigenvalue distributions of certain large euclidean random matrices that appear in problems of wave propagation in random media . because in the simplest case of scalar waves the propagation",
    "is described by a scalar wave equation , the function @xmath5 that will be of interest to us is the green s function @xmath6 of the helmholtz equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a positive infinitesimal .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath9 .",
    "statistical properties of the ensemble of matrices @xmath10 with elements @xmath11 for @xmath12 are of primary importance in the context of anderson localization of electromagnetic @xcite and matter @xcite waves .",
    "the same matrices appear in the studies of collective spontaneous emission in dense atomic systems @xcite .",
    "the interplay between anderson localization and dicke superradiance can also be described by this ensemble of matrices @xcite and properties of their eigenvalues are important for understanding of random lasers @xcite and dynamic instabilities in nonlinear random media @xcite . meanwhile",
    ", the matrix @xmath10 is non - hermitian , its eigenvalues are complex and their probability distribution is difficult to access .",
    "this is why in several works dealing with superradiance @xcite the imaginary part of @xmath10 , a matrix with elements @xmath13 , was considered .",
    "this real symmetric matrix is much easier to study and in many situations it still contains some of the important aspects of the full problem .",
    "similarly , the real part of @xmath10 , a matrix with elements @xmath14 , is relevant for understanding the collective lamb shifts in dense atomic systems @xcite .    despite the importance of the three matrices @xmath10 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 introduced above",
    "little is known about statistical properties of their eigenvalues . in the general case ,",
    "the eigenvalue distribution of @xmath10 was studied only numerically @xcite .",
    "some analytic results are available in the limit of high density of points @xmath3 inside a sphere : @xmath17 @xcite , when the summation in the eigenvalue equation @xmath18 can be replaced by integration .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to partially fill this gap by considering eigenvalue distributions of the three matrices above at finite densities @xmath19 , with the distances between neighboring points @xmath3 that are larger than , comparable , or smaller than the wavelength @xmath20 .",
    "this situation is of particular importance in the context of wave propagation in random media because in order to observe phenomena due to scattering of waves on the heterogeneities of the medium , the density of scattering centers ( or scatterers ) should be neither too low ( in this case the scattering is negligible ) , nor too high ( in this case the medium responds as an effective homogeneous medium ) .",
    "one of the possible experimental realizations of a strongly scattering system is a cloud of cold atoms in which propagation of quasi - resonant light ( wavelength @xmath21 ) is studied .",
    "nowadays such clouds are routinely created at densities @xmath22 , allowing observation of interesting phenomena due to the multiple scattering of light @xcite .",
    "this justifies the importance of properly understanding the low - density regime .",
    "however , the most interesting phenomena for waves in an ensemble of point - like scattering centers are known to take place at densities @xmath23 , when interference effects become important , eventually leading to anderson localization ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "our results may be useful for understanding anderson localization and its interplay with other collective phenomena ( such as dicke superradiance ) @xcite .",
    "before presenting the details of calculations , let us list our main results :    * a general framework is developed to deal with hermitian euclidean matrices ( ) .",

    "the domain of existence of eigenvalues of @xmath43 undergoes a transformation from a circular to a triangular shape as @xmath33 increases from 0 to 1 . for @xmath37 ,",
    "numerical simulations show that the support of the distribution on the complex plane takes an ` inverted t ' shape .",
    "* the non - hermitian matrix @xmath44 with elements given by the green s function of the helmholtz equation is studied in by means of extensive numerical simulations .",
    "we find that at low density @xmath35 and for @xmath36 the domain of existence of eigenvalues of @xmath10 on the complex plane coincides with that of @xmath43 and is given by a circle of radius @xmath45 centered at @xmath46 . at larger @xmath33 ,",
    "the domain remains approximately a circle with the same center but a larger radius @xmath47 .",
    "when the density @xmath34 reaches a critical values of approximately 30 , a ` hole ' opens in the eigenvalue distribution that otherwise still keeps its circular shape . *",
    "the numerically evaluated marginal distributions of real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues @xmath25 of the matrix @xmath10 roughly follow the laws obtained for the eigenvalues of the matrices @xmath32 ( for @xmath35 ) and @xmath26 ( for @xmath48 ) , respectively . for @xmath49 ,",

    "the first important property of the matrix @xmath26 is the positiveness of its eigenvalues : @xmath126 .",

    "it can be established using various approaches , such as , e.g. , the diagrammatic technique @xcite . however , to our knowledge , the fact that this distribution describes eigenvalues of the euclidean matrix @xmath26 was never noticed before .",

    "for the three random matrices under study , the two important parameters of the eigenvalue distributions @xmath24 are @xmath423 and the number of points per wavelength cube @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath33 is equal to the variance of eigenvalues @xmath25 of both @xmath26 and @xmath32 in the limit of @xmath424 .    in the low - density limit @xmath22 and for @xmath42 ,",
    "the distributions of eigenvalues of hermitian matrices @xmath26 and @xmath32 are parameterized uniquely by @xmath33 : the distribution of eigenvalues of @xmath26 is given by the marchenko - pastur law , whereas the distribution of eigenvalues of @xmath32 can be deduced from the blue function that we derived in this paper . for @xmath31 the marchenko - pastur does not apply to @xmath26 anymore , but out equation still works for @xmath32 as long as @xmath34 is small enough .",
    "as @xmath33 increases , describes a transition from the wigner semi - circle law ( at @xmath36 ) to the cauchy distribution ( at @xmath37 ) . at high densities @xmath425 the more complete expression that we derived for the blue function of the matrix @xmath32 applies .",
    "it is in good agreement with numerical simulations until @xmath264 where it predicts the appearance of a gap in @xmath24 , which is not observed in the numerical data .",
    "the eigenvalue distribution of the non - hermitian matrix @xmath10 has a circular structure on the complex plane . at @xmath36 ,",
    "the eigenvalues are confined to a circle of radius @xmath45 centered at @xmath46 . at larger @xmath33 ,",
    "the distribution becomes strongly asymmetric , with much stronger weight of eigenvalues with imaginary parts close to @xmath426 .",
    "our numerical results show that the domain of existence of eigenvalues is still approximately a circle centered at @xmath46 .",
    "we proposed an empirical expression for its radius @xmath427 . at high densities",
    "@xmath428 , a hole appears in the distribution @xmath24 on the complex plane .",
    "the density at which the hole appears seems to be roughly independent of @xmath33 .",
    "the marginal probability distribution of @xmath338 is described by our equation at all @xmath33 , provided that @xmath262 .",
    "the marginal distribution of @xmath52 follows the marchenko - pastur law for @xmath48 and decays as @xmath429 at larger @xmath33 .    finally , we studied a model matrix @xmath430 in which two independent ensembles of points @xmath39 and @xmath40 were used to generate matrices @xmath32 and @xmath41 .",
    "the matrices @xmath32 and @xmath41 are asymptotically free and the distribution of eigenvalues of @xmath43 at @xmath42 can be found using the approach developed by jarosz and nowak @xcite based on the theory of free random variables .",
    "the distribution of eigenvalues shows an interesting transition from a circular shape at @xmath36 to a triangular shape at @xmath431 , and then to an ` inverted t ' shape for @xmath37 .",
