    "high quality quasi two - dimensional electron systems ( 2des ) realized in gaas / algaas semiconductor heterostructures have long served to examine intriguing phenomena.@xcite the rich new physics in this material system has animated further improvements in material quality which , in turn , has driven new developments within the field .",
    "physical phenomena induced by microwave and terahertz photo - excitation at high filling factors or low magnetic fields , @xmath0 , may be counted amongst these developments . here , the realization of radiation - induced @xmath1-periodic magnetoresistance oscillations and associated zero - resistance states led to broad experimental @xcite and theoretical@xcite investigations of transport in the photo - excited 2des .",
    "the microwave and terahertz radiation - induced magneto - resistance oscillations in the 2des are characterized by @xmath1 periodic oscillations in the diagonal magnetoresistance , @xmath2 , of the 2des at cryogenic temperatures , @xmath3 .",
    "these @xmath2 oscillations show a strong sensitivity to @xmath3 and the microwave power , @xmath4 , at modest @xmath4 .",
    "proposed mechanisms for such oscillations include radiation - assisted indirect inter - landau - level scattering by phonons and impurities ( the displacement model),@xcite non - parabolicity effects in an ac - driven system ( the non - parabolicity model),@xcite a radiation - induced steady state non - equilibrium distribution ( the inelastic model),@xcite and the periodic motion of the electron orbit centers under irradiation ( the radiation driven electron orbit model).@xcite    under typical experimental conditions , some or all of these mechanisms can contribute towards sufficiently large amplitude radiation - induced magneto - resistivity oscillations such that , theoretically , at the oscillatory minima , the magneto - resistivity is able to take on negative values . according to theory , negative resistivity triggers , however , an instability in the uniform current distribution , leading to current domain formation , and the experimentally observed zero - resistance states.@xcite    although these theories suggest radiation - induced magneto - resistance oscillations , they differ with respect to their predictions on , for example , the microwave polarization sensitivity in the radiation - induced oscillations . here",
    ", the displacement model predicts that the oscillation - amplitude depends on whether the microwave electric field , @xmath5 , is parallel or perpendicular to the @xmath6-electric field , @xmath7.@xcite on the other hand , the inelastic model unequivocally asserts polarization insensitivity to the radiation - induced magneto - resistance oscillations.@xcite polarization immunity , in the radiation - driven electron orbit model , depends parametrically upon the damping factor , @xmath8 , exceeding the frequency of the microwave field.@xcite finally , the non - parabolicity model suggests a perceptible polarization sensitivity for linearly polarized microwaves,@xcite while indicating the absence of such oscillations for circularly polarized radiation.@xcite from the experimental perspective , previous work on l - shaped hall bars indicated that the frequency and phase of the radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations are insensitive to the microwave polarization.@xcite other work on square - shaped specimens asserted the insensitivity of the microwave induced magneto - resistance oscillations to the polarization sense of circularly and linearly polarized microwaves.@xcite    = 3.25 in    here , we investigate the effect of rotating , _ in - situ _ , the polarization of linearly polarized microwaves relative to long - axis of hall bars .",
    "strikingly , we find that the amplitude of the radiation - induced magneto - resistance oscillations are remarkably responsive to the relative orientation between the linearly polarized microwave electric field and the current - axis in the specimen .",
    "the results appear qualitatively consistent with the displacement , the non - parabolicity , and the radiation driven electron orbit model for @xmath9 .",
    "experimental microwave polarization studies in this context are difficult to carry out since it is non - trivial to rotate , in - situ , a specimen with wires over @xmath10 at the end of a @xmath11 long sample holder , within a small ( @xmath12 ) diameter low temperature cryostat . to overcome this barrier ,",
    "we have developed , instead , a setup where the wired sample remains fixed within the cryostat , while the microwave polarization is rotated with respect to the sample , from outside the cryostat . to achieve this capability ,",
    "1 , the canonical rectangular waveguide was replaced with a circular ( @xmath13 i.d . )",
    "waveguide , and a rotatable coax - to - waveguide - adapter , probe - coupled , electric - monopole - antenna , microwave - launcher [ mw - antenna in fig .",
    "1(a ) ] was developed to couple microwaves into the waveguide . here , the angular position of the mw - antenna could be set as desired and then locked in place with a clamped quick connect .",
    "the hall bar sample was mounted at the low temperature ( @xmath14 ) end of the circular waveguide as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , and the long axis of the device was oriented parallel to polarization axis of the mw - antenna .",
    "thus , @xmath15 , [ see fig .",
    "1(b ) ] , represents the rotation angle of the mw - antenna with respect to the device long - axis .",
    "these hall bars , with a width @xmath16 , were characterized by n ( 4.2k ) = 2.2@xmath17@xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the four - terminal diagonal resistance , @xmath21 , was extracted from @xmath22 measurements between adjacent diagonal voltage contacts , [ see fig .",
    "1(b ) ] , as the current @xmath23 was applied via the ends .",
    "thus , the length ( l)-to - width ( w ) ratio for the @xmath2 measurements was @xmath24 , see fig . 1 .",
    "= 3.25 in    some questions of interest here include whether polarized microwaves are produced by the mw antenna , and whether this polarization is preserved to the specimen . in order to answer these questions ,",
    "preliminary tests were carried out using an `` analyzer '' consisting of an electric - monopole , probe - coupled - antenna and square law detector .",
    "bench tests carried out with the mw - antenna [ fig .",
    "1(a ) ] and the `` analyzer '' indicated that polarized microwaves were generated by the microwave launcher . for further tests ,",
    "this `` analyzer '' was placed at the sample end of the sample holder and fixed at a particular orientation , as the mw - antenna was rotated through @xmath10 at @xmath25 increments . fig .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) show the normalized detector response , @xmath26 , of the diode detector at @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the figure exhibits the expected sinusoidal variation , i.e. , @xmath29 , for linearly polarized radiation , of the received power as a function @xmath15 .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "2 are fits to @xmath30 .",
    "we find , for fig .",
    "2(a ) , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , and for fig .",
    "2(b ) , @xmath31 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . here , @xmath36 is within experimental uncertainties .",
    "thus , polarized radiation is generated at the launcher and the polarization is preserved down to the sample .",
    "= 3.25 in    figure 3 exhibits the @xmath2 vs. @xmath0 at @xmath37 , with the hall bar sample ( @xmath38 ) in place at the bottom of the waveguide sample holder .",
    "figures 3(a ) and ( b ) show the results obtained at a source - power @xmath39 , while figs .",
    "3(c ) and(d ) show the same obtained at @xmath40 . here ,",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 represent the measurement on the left ( l ) and right ( r ) sides of the device(fig .",
    "1 ) . each panel of fig .",
    "3 includes three traces : a dark trace ( in black ) obtained in the absence of microwave photoexcitation . a @xmath43 trace in red , where the mw antenna is parallel to the long - axis of the hall bar .",
    "a comparison of fig .",
    "3(a ) and ( c ) [ or fig .",
    "3(b ) and ( d ) ] shows that the @xmath44 ( red ) traces exhibit larger - amplitude radiation - induced magneto - resistance oscillations at @xmath39 than at @xmath40 .",
    "this feature corresponds to the usual observation that the oscillation - amplitude increases with @xmath4 at modest photo - excitation.@xcite finally ,",
    "the panels of fig . 3 also exhibit , in green , the @xmath45 traces , where the mw antenna is perpendicular to the long - axis of the hall bar . again , as expected , a comparison of fig .",
    "3(a ) and ( c ) [ or fig .",
    "3(b ) and ( d ) ] shows that the @xmath46 traces exhibit larger amplitude radiation - induced magneto - resistance oscillations at @xmath47 [ fig .",
    "3(a ) ] than at @xmath40 [ fig .",
    "3(b ) ] .",
    "the remarkable feature is observed when one compares the red ( @xmath44 ) and green ( @xmath46 ) traces within any single panel of fig .",
    "such a comparison indicates that the amplitude of the radiation - induced magneto - resistance oscillations is reduced at the @xmath45 mw antenna orientation .",
    "thus far , our experiments have shown upto a factor - of - ten reduction in the oscillation amplitude under polarization rotation .",
    "although the magneto - resistance oscillations are reduced in amplitude , typically , they are not completely extinguished at @xmath48 . finally , the period and the phase of the radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations are unchanged by mw - antenna rotation ; this feature is readily apparent in fig .",
    "3 . figure 4 illustrates similar measurements in a second specimen ( @xmath49 ) at @xmath50 [ fig .",
    "4(a ) ] , @xmath51 [ fig .",
    "4(b ) ] , and @xmath52 [ fig .",
    "4(c ) ] at various @xmath4 . as is evident in fig .",
    "4 , the oscillation amplitude is again reduced for @xmath45 .",
    "in considering the implications , it is necessary to note that , since @xmath53 over the range of @xmath0 where the photo - excited resistance oscillations are observed , the @xmath6-electric field should be oriented nearly perpendicular to the hall bar axis ( see fig.1 ) . in the displacement model of ref.@xcite , the inter - landau level contribution to the photo - current includes a term with a bessel function whose argument depended upon whether @xmath7 and @xmath5 are parallel or perpendicular to each other .",
    "hence , the dissipative microwave photoconductivity can exhibit polarization selectivity in the displacement model . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , for @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the inelastic- and the single particle- relaxation times , respectively , a larger contribution to the amplitude of the radiation - induced magneto - oscillations is provided by the inelastic mechanism than by the displacement mechanism .",
    "further , ref .",
    "@xcite indicated that the inelastic mechanism does not depend on the orientation of the linear polarization of the microwave field , unlike the displacement mechanism , which also yields a @xmath3-independent contribution to the oscillatory conductivity . in their radiation",
    "driven electron orbit model,@xcite polarization immunity is realized when @xmath57 .",
    "finally , the non - parabolicity model included a strong polarization sensitivity , with the dissipation an odd function of the de - tuning from cyclotron resonance.@xcite    based on the above , these experimental results appear qualitatively similar to expectations based on a `` displacement '' or `` non - parabolic '' or a `` radiation - driven electron orbit '' term with @xmath9 .",
    "yet , the experimental feature that the oscillations do not vanish completely at @xmath45 seems not to rule out , at least at this stage of experimentation , the existence of a linear - polarization - immune - term in the radiation - induced transport .",
    "next , we address the report of linear polarization immunity in ref .",
    "those measurements were apparently carried out on @xmath58 square shaped specimens , with a length to width ratio of one.@xcite in such a square specimen with point contacts , the current stream lines are expected to point in different directions over the face of the sample .",
    "then , the variable angle between the linear microwave polarization and the local current orientation could possibly serve to produce an effectively polarization averaged measurement .",
    "finally , we comment upon expectation for the relative sensitivity / immunity of the radiation - induced magneto - resistance oscillations to the sense of circular polarization in the hall bar geometry where the current orientation is presumably well defined , given the remarkable sensitivity to linear polarization shown here : recall that both senses of circularly polarized radiation can be decomposed , into one linearly polarized wave that is polarized parallel to the long axis , and another @xmath46 phase shifted linearly polarized wave that is polarized parallel to the short axis of the device .",
    "since the linearly polarized component , which is responsible for stimulating the radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations , occurs in both decompositions , immunity of the radiation - induced magneto - resistance oscillations to the sense of circular polarization seems plausible even when there is a strong sensitivity to the sense of linear polarization in the hall bar .",
