    "information theoretical methods are starting to be important tools for studies of quantum mechanical systems .",
    "an example is the application of the maximum entropy principle @xcite ( mep ) to the calculation of the wave function in a potential @xcite using as constraints expectation values of simple observables and reconstructing a quantum wave function from a limited set of expectation values .",
    "the idea behind the mep is to choose the least biased result , compatible with the constraints of the problem .",
    "thus the mep provides the least biased description consistent with the available relevant information .",
    "this is done by employing a suitably defined information entropy ( ie ) that measures the lack of information associated with the distribution of a quantum state over a given known basis .",
    "a measure of the ie is shannon s information entropy @xmath2 @xcite . for a continuous probability distribution @xmath8",
    "( @xmath9 ) @xmath2 is defined @xmath10    shannon s ie has played an important role in the study of quantum mechanical systems , in clarifying fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics and in the synthesis of probability densities in position and momentum space @xcite .",
    "an important step was the discovery of an entropic uncertainty relation @xcite .",
    "for a three - dimensional system it has the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 are shannon s ies in coordinate and momentum space and @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the density distribution ( dd ) and momentum distribution ( md ) , respectively , normalized to 1 .",
    "inequality ( [ s1 ] ) is an information - theoretical uncertainty relation stronger than heisenberg s @xcite and does not depend on the unit of length in measuring @xmath15 and @xmath14 , i.e. the sum @xmath16 is invariant to uniform scaling of coordinates , while the individual entropies @xmath0 and @xmath1 are not .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath2 is that it is a measure of quantum - mechanical uncertainty and represents the information content of a probability distribution , in our case of the nuclear density and momentum distributions .",
    "inequality ( [ s1 ] ) provides a lower bound for @xmath2 which is attained for gaussian wave functions .",
    "we quote march who refers to the information entropy with the following words : `` further work is called for before the importance of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in atomic theory can be assessed''.@xcite we could extend that statement for fermionic and correlated bosonic systems as well .",
    "shannons s ies @xmath0 and @xmath1 have been recently studied for the densities of various systems @xcite : the nucleon dd of nuclei , the valence electron dd of metallic clusters and the dd of correlated bose alkali atoms . it has been found that the same functional form @xmath17 for the entropy sum as function of the number of particles @xmath6 holds approximately for the above systems in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite for atomic systems .",
    "another interesting result @xcite is the fact the entropy of an @xmath18phonon state subjected to gaussian noise increases linearly with the logarithm of @xmath19 . in refs .",
    "@xcite the dependence of @xmath2 on the short - range correlations ( src ) parameter of the nucleons in nuclei , and of the particle interaction in various uniform fermi systems ( nuclear matter , @xmath20he liquid , and electron gas ) has been found .",
    "this dependence as well as the linear dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath3 were used in ref .",
    "@xcite to determine the src parameter of nucleons in @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23shell nuclei . in ref .",
    "@xcite another definition of ie according to phase - space considerations @xcite was used and an information theoretical criterion for the quality of a nuclear dd was derived , i.e. the larger @xmath2 the better the quality of the nuclear model . in ref .",
    "@xcite the dd , the md and the shannon s ies were calculated for nuclei using three different cluster expansions .",
    "the parameters of the various expressions were determined by least - squares fit of the theoretical charge form factors to the experimental ones .",
    "it was found that the larger the entropy sum , the smaller is the value of @xmath24 , indicating that the maximal @xmath2 is a criterion of the quality of a given nuclear model according to the mep .",
    "only two exceptions to that rule were found out of many cases examined . before proceeding ,",
    "it is appropriate to mention that additional applications of entropy have attracted interest in recent years @xcite , but in a different spirit , in nuclear physics problems , such as in analysis of shell - model eigenvectors .",
    "the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite defined a correlational entropy .",
    "we note , however , that this is a von neumann entropy , which they applied in the framework of the nuclear shell model . in our case",
    "we use the definition of the ie according to shannon applied to the density distribution in coordinate and in momentum space of a nuclear system .",
    "finally , alternative measures of the ie have been proposed by onisescu @xcite and by brukner and zeilinger @xcite .",
    "the motivation of the present work is to extend our previous study of ie in nuclei using as many experimental data available in the literature as possible . in this way",
    ", it will be possible to study important features of realistic nuclear systems , e.g. the effects of nucleon - nucleon correlations on basic nuclear characteristics , such as density and momentum distributions .",
    "thus , instead of starting our study from a given nuclear model we start from the `` experimental '' dds from refs . @xcite and @xcite ( obtained from electron scattering by nuclei and muonic atoms ) or / and from estimations of `` experimental '' mds from refs .",
    "@xcite based on superscaling analysis @xcite of inclusive electron scattering from nuclei as well as on the coherence density fluctuation model ( cdfm ) @xcite which helps to calculate the md in connection with the dd and vice versa .",
    "this study helps in two ways :    first , it helps to strengthen the empirical property @xmath4 which has been proposed in previous studies for various fermion systems @xcite .",
    "also it enables us to strengthen the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite that the more experimental data we use in the theory the larger is the ie of a nucleus , i.e. the larger @xmath2 the better the quality of the dd of a nucleus is .",
    "for the five models which we applied to various nuclei from @xmath25he to @xmath26u it was found that the same functional form of @xmath2 holds , while the values of the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 depend on the model .",
    "the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) shell - model is closer to the lower limit of inequality ( [ s1 ] ) which is attained only for the @xmath25he nucleus . the results for more realistic models deviate from the ho ones .",
    "the deviation becomes larger when more experimental data are included in the model .",
    "the various cases we considered can be classified according to either the quantity of the experimental data we use or the values of @xmath2 , i.e. , the increase of the quality of the density and of the momentum distributions leads to an increase of the values of @xmath2 . as the dd and the md based on experimental data",
    "should be considered as the least biased ones , our results are in accordance with the mep .",
    "another characteristic result is that the various lines @xmath29 are almost parallel , i.e. , there is a kind of scaling of the values of @xmath2 for the various models .",
    "second , our work helps to connect the ie with other physical quantities such as the root - mean - square ( rms ) radius of the nucleus or the mean volume in which the nucleons are confined in a nucleus . if shannon s ie",
    "is considered as ensemble entropy , this connection could be used to relate the mean volume of the nucleus or the mass number with the `` ensemble volume '' through the relation @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "this ensemble volume provides a direct measure of uncertainty of the system which is advantageous when one wishes to compare the spread of two ensembles of a given type .",
    "finally , the present work might also help to choose the most reliable experiment when more than one experiments are made for the same nucleus .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review the theory of the cdfm and describe the way in which the ies @xmath0 , @xmath1 and their sum can be calculated from the dd or / and the md . in sec .",
    "iii the numerical calculations of ies for various nuclei , using three different approaches , are presented and compared with previous calculations .",
    "the possibility of choosing the most reliable experiment , when more than one experiments are made for the same nucleus , is also discussed . in sec .",
    "iv , a dependence of the ie sum on the mean volume of the nucleus is proposed and a connection between the ensemble volume of the nucleus and the mean volume or the mass number is given .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "v contains our conclusions .",
    "in order to find the information entropy of various nuclei , the distributions of the density and the momentum should be known .",
    "these distributions can be found using various models .",
    "another way is to employ given dds , i.e. , the phenomenological ones given e.g. from refs .",
    "@xcite or the `` experimental '' mds using the superscaling analysis in nuclei @xcite . the idea is to use the cdfm to find the md in connection with the dd or to find the dd in relation to the md of a nucleus .",
    "the cdfm @xcite is related to the @xmath31function limit of the generator coordinate method @xcite in which the @xmath32body wave function of a nucleus is written in the form @xmath33 where the generating function @xmath34 depends on the coordinates of the nucleons ( radius - vector , spin , isospin ) and on the generator coordinates @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 is usually chosen to be a slater determinant built up from single - particle wave functions corresponding to a given construction potential parameterized by the generator coordinates .",
    "the weight function @xmath37 can be determined ( using the variational principle ) as a solution of the hill - wheeler integral equation @xmath38 f(x')\\ , d x'=0 ,   \\label{hill}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 denotes a set of @xmath35 .    in the cdfm the dd and the md",

    "( [ den - k-2 ] ) shows the md as a functional of the density distribution .",
    "this point is discussed in refs .",

    "we note that for the calculation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 we use dd and md normalized to 1 .",
    "in the recent paper @xcite the momentum distribution of nuclei @xmath25he , @xmath60c , @xmath61al , @xmath62fe , and @xmath63au was calculated using the analysis of the superscaling phenomenon in inclusive electron scattering from nuclei @xcite . from those distributions and from eq .",

    "( [ sr - k-1 ] ) .",
    "we note the symmetry of the expressions ( [ den - k-2 ] ) and ( [ den - r-2 ] ) for both equivalent basic characteristics , the nucleon momentum and local density distributions .",
    "for the calculation of the information entropy of a nucleus we used three different approaches . in the first one we used the `` experimental '' dds for various nuclei from @xmath25he to @xmath26u from refs .",
    "@xcite . for the various dds existing in the literature we used only two or three parameter fermi ( 2pf , 3pf ) distributions from @xcite @xmath68 }   \\label{23pf}\\ ] ] ( @xmath69 in the 2pf distributions ) , and the symmetrized fermi distributions from @xcite @xmath70 the reason we avoided the use of other phenomenological distributions is that there usually exist oscillations in the central region of the densities of the nuclei which destroy the constraint @xmath71 .",
    "this is not the case for the fermi - type distributions .    from those distributions and from eq .",
    "( [ den - k-2 ] ) the md for various nuclei can be found . in the second approach we used the `` experimental '' md from the superscaling analysis of ref .",

    "( [ den - r-2 ] ) the dd of these nuclei were found . in the third approach we used",

    "ii we found only three exceptions which correspond to nuclei @xmath77 mg , @xmath78nd and @xmath26u .",
    "the disagreement of the results for these nuclei to the above rule is due to the following reasons :    in @xmath77 mg the 3pf distributions which have been used in the cases of momentum transfer ranges : @xmath79 and @xmath80 give charge distributions which become @xmath81 for relatively small values of the radius ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "this is not the case for the 2pf distribution ( @xmath76range@xmath83 ) which becomes @xmath81 for much larger values of @xmath84 .",
    "the existence of the logarithm of the density in the integral of @xmath0 makes the ie sensitive to the tail of the dd .",

    "@xmath78nd the value of @xmath2 corresponding to the @xmath76range@xmath85 @xmath86 is larger than the value of @xmath2 corresponding to the @xmath76range@xmath87 @xmath86 .",
    "we expected the inverse order .",
    "this disagreement should be due to the fact that the real analysis of the electron scattering data was made with a deformed fermi distribution in the latter case ( see the corresponding remark of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . that deformation was not taken into account in our calculations .    in the case of the nucleus @xmath26u the 2pf distributions",
    "do not give the experimental charge rms radius 5.84 fm and 5.854 fm corresponding to the momentum transfer ranges : @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively .",

    "the corresponding values of @xmath2 are 9.8762 and 9.8978 , respectively .",
    "the relatively small values of @xmath2 in the latter case is due to the fact that the constraint @xmath93 does not hold for all the values of @xmath84 .",
    "this has as a result the high - momentum components of the md not to be reproduced within the cdfm as correctly as in the former case .    from the above discussion",
    "we should conclude that shannon s information entropy could be used to compare different experiments for the same nucleus and to choose the most reliable one .",
    "the strong dependence of @xmath0 and the nearly independence of @xmath1 on @xmath3 leads us to connect @xmath2 with the rms radius of a nucleus , i.e. , with the volume of the nucleus where the nucleons are confined .",

    "@xcite in both approaches .",
    "the different slope of the line of the second approach comes from the cdfm we have used to calculate the dds of the five nuclei from the md @xcite .    in ref @xcite it has been shown that for any ensemble ( classical or quantum , discrete or continous ) there is essentially only one measure of the `` volume '' occupied by the ensemble , which is compatible with basic geometrical notions .",
    "this volume is called `` ensemble volume '' and provides a universal choice or a direct measure of uncertainty , which is advantageous when one wishes to compare the spreads of two ensembles of a given type .",
    "the ensemble volume turns out to be proportional to the exponent of the entropy of the ensemble @xcite , i.e. @xmath99 the constant @xmath100 is a normalization constant reflecting the notion that only relative volumes are of real interest in comparing different ensembles .    using eq .",

    "it was mentioned in the introduction that eq .",

    "thus , eq . ( [ v - ense - a ] ) is also valid for atoms , metallic clusters and for correlated bosonic systems .    from the linear dependence of @xmath2 on the logarithm of the mean volume of the nucleons , eq .",
    "( [ s - v ] ) , and from eq .",
    "( [ v - ense ] ) a relation between the ensemble volume of the nucleus and the mean volume of it can be found .",
    "that relation is @xmath106 thus , the ensemble volume of a nucleus is analogous to @xmath107 .    from the three approaches we have considered , the first and",
    "the third are the most reliable ones because the dd s are based on experimental data . in these two approaches the values of the parameter @xmath98 are quite close to 1 .",
    "that is why we could say that the ensemble volume of a nucleus is analogous to the mean volume of the nucleus .",
    "a study of shannon s ies in coordinate space , @xmath0 , in momentum space , @xmath1 , and their sum , @xmath2 , was made for many nuclei using three approaches based on `` experimental '' dds or / and on `` experimental '' mds .    in the first approach we used fermi - type phenomenological dds reproducing the electron scattering experiments for many nuclei from @xmath25he to @xmath26u @xcite .",

    "the dds and the mds were used for the evaluation of the ies @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "it was found that in the three approaches @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 depend linearly on the logarithm of the mass number in accordance with previous studies of various fermi systems .",
    "the values of @xmath2 found in the three approaches of the present work were compared with the ones evaluated with the ho case and the short - range correlated dds and mds .",
    "it was found that for all the nuclei we have considered the following inequalities hold @xmath108 thus , the various cases can be classified according to either the quantity of the experimental data we used or the values of the ie sum obtained for the various nuclei . in other words",
    "the increase of the quality of the dd or / and of the md leads to an increase of the values of the ie sum according the maximum entropy principle .",
    "it is also found that @xmath0 depends strongly on @xmath3 and does not depend very much on the model we use .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath1 is opposite .",
    "the properties of @xmath0 and @xmath1 lead us to find that , within an additive constant the information entropy @xmath2 is proportional to the logarithm of the mean volume of the nucleus in accordance with the fact that for equilibrium ensembles the thermodynamical entropy is proportional to the ensemble volume@xcite . in the case that shannon s entropy may be considered as ensemble entropy , a connection of the ensemble volume with the mass number of the nucleus or with the mean volume of the nucleus can be found .",
    "finally , the comparison of the values of @xmath2 for the same nucleus using phenomenological dds from the analysis of different experiments could be used to choose the most reliable one .",

    "<S> the information entropies in coordinate and momentum spaces and their sum ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) are evaluated for many nuclei using `` experimental '' densities or / and momentum distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the results are compared with the harmonic oscillator model and with the short - range correlated distributions . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that @xmath0 depends strongly on @xmath3 and does not depend very much on the model . </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour of @xmath1 is opposite . </S>",
    "<S> the various cases we consider can be classified according to either the quantity of the experimental data we use or by the values of @xmath2 , i.e. , the increase of the quality of the density and of the momentum distributions leads to an increase of the values of @xmath2 . in all cases , apart from the linear relation @xmath4 , the linear relation @xmath5 also holds . </S>",
    "<S> v is the mean volume of the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath2 is considered as an ensemble entropy , a relation between @xmath6 or @xmath7 and the ensemble volume can be found . finally , comparing different electron scattering experiments for the same nucleus </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that the larger the momentum transfer ranges , the larger the information entropy is . </S>",
    "<S> it is concluded that @xmath2 could be used to compare different experiments for the same nucleus and to choose the most reliable one . </S>",
