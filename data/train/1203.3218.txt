    "the neutrino - nucleus scattering on @xmath0c is important because this nucleus is a component of many liquid scintillator detectors . as such",
    "it has been employed in experimental facilities lsnd , karmen , and lampf to search for neutrino oscillations , and for measuring neutrino - nucleus cross sections .",
    "the @xmath0c target will be used as well in several planned experiments , such as the spallation neutron source ( sns ) at oak ridge national laboratory , and the large volume detector ( lvd ) at gran sasso national laboratories . on the other hand ,",
    "this nucleus is important for astrophysics studies , as it forms one of the onion - like shells of large stars before they collapse .",

    "a comprehensive theoretical review on neutrino - nucleus interaction was done by kolbe @xcite .",
    "the most widely used formalism for neutrino - nucleus scattering was developed by the walecka group  @xcite .",

    "this terminology is not used in nuclear @xmath7-decay and @xmath8-capture , where one only speaks on vector and axial matrix elements with different degrees of forbiddenness : allowed ( gt and fermi ) , first forbidden , second forbidden , .",
    "motivated by this fact , we extend the formalism of weak interaction processes developed in @xcite , obtaining new expressions for the transition rates , which greatly facilitate numerical calculations , both for neutrino - nucleus reactions and muon capture .    the weak hamiltonian is expressed in the form  @xcite h_()&=&j_l_e^-i , [ 1]where @xmath9 is the fermi coupling constant ( in natural units ) , the leptonic current @xmath10 is given by ( * ? ? ?",
