    "the study of the nucleon induced deuteron breakup is a powerfull tool to test the nuclear hamiltonian @xcite . by comparing theoretical predictions to breakup data in different configurations of the outgoing nucleons not",
    "only the present day models of two - nucleon ( 2n ) interactions can be tested but also effects of three - nucleon forces ( 3nf ) can be studied @xcite .    despite spectacular successes in interpreting some breakup data based on a 3n hamiltonian with free nn interactions supplemented by genuine 3nf s @xcite , some clear cut discrepancies between theory and data exist and require further theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "those discrepancies can be divided into ones occuring at low and at higher energies .",
    "the last ones occur at energies of the incoming nucleon above @xmath2  mev and since the 3nf effects in the 3n continuum increase with energy @xcite they can be probably traced back to neglected short - range terms of the 3nf .",
    "also in some specific phase - space regions of the nd breakup effects of relativity can play a role @xcite    low energy discrepancies were found in proton - deuteron ( pd ) pd and neutron - deuteron ( nd ) breakup in some particular kinematical arrangements of the outgoing three nucleons @xcite .",
    "the strongest discrepancies between theoretical cross sections and data occur in the nn qfs @xcite and in the symmetrical nd space star ( sst ) @xcite geometries .    in the sst configuration three",
    "nucleons are flying away in the plane perpendicular to the incoming beam in the c.m .",
    "system with momenta of equal magnitude and a pairwise angular separation of @xmath3 degrees .",
    "the low energy pd sst cross sections @xcite are slightly overestimated and the nd sst cross sections @xcite are clearly underestimated by pure nd ( the pp coulomb force neglected ) theoretical predictions .",
    "the theoretical cross sections practically do not depend on the nn potential used in the calculations  @xcite .",
    "they also do not change significantly if any of the present day 3nf models is included  @xcite .",
    "the observed diminishing of the disagreement between nd theory and pd sst data with increasing proton energy : @xcite ( @xmath4  mev ) , @xcite ( @xmath5  mev ) , and @xcite ( @xmath6  mev ) , leading to a quite good description of the @xmath7  mev pd data @xcite , led to the conclusion , that probably the neglected pp coulomb force is responsible for the low energy pd sst cross section discrepancies .",
    "however , recent breakup calculations with the long - range coulomb force included revealed only a small lowering of the sst cross section by the pp coulomb force @xcite .",
    "much larger discrepancies up to @xmath8 have been found for the nd sst .",
    "the data come from independent measurements , performed at the same energy and with different experimental arrangements : @xmath9  mev @xcite , @xmath10  mev @xcite , @xmath11  mev @xcite .",
    "the qfs refers to a situation where one of the nucleons is at rest in the laboratory system . in the pd breakup",
    "the np or pp qfs configurations are possible , while for the nd breakup np or nn can form a quasi - freely scattered pair .",
    "the cross sections for pp qfs in pd breakup : @xcite ( @xmath4  mev ) , @xcite ( @xmath5  mev ) , and @xcite ( @xmath6  mev ) , and for nn qfs : @xcite ( @xmath12  mev ) , @xcite ( @xmath13  mev ) , and @xcite ( @xmath14  mev ) , and np qfs @xcite in nd breakup have been measured and the picture resembles that for sst : also here the pp qfs cross sections are overestimated by the nd theory while the nn qfs cross sections are clearly underestimated by @xmath15 .",
    "suprisingly , when instead of the nn pair the np pair is quasi - freely scattered , the theory follows nicely the np qfs cross section data taken in the nd breakup measurement @xcite . also the nd theory provides qfs cross sections which are highly independent from the realistic nn potential used in the calculations and they practically do not change when any of the present day 3nf s is included  @xcite .",
    "again , the discrepancies between nd theory and pp qfs cross sections diminish with increasing energy @xcite , indicating that the neglected pp coulomb force is probably responsible for them . also here",
    "the pd breakup calculations show that the pp coulomb force only slightly lowers the nd theory in the pp qfs region @xcite .",
    "the good description of the np qfs cross section data from the @xmath12  mev nd breakup measurement @xcite contrasts with the drastic discrepancy to the nn qfs cross section data taken in the same experiment @xcite .",
    "this prompted us to look closely how different nn force components contribute to qfs cross sections .",
    "this is outlined in section ii , while section iii deals with the sst cross sections .",
    "we summarize in section iv .",
    "the tests are performed using the ( semi)phenomenological nn potentials alone ( av18 @xcite , cd bonn @xcite , nijm1 and nijm2 @xcite ) or combining them with the @xmath16-exchange tm99 3nf @xcite . for details of our approach to solve the 3n faddeev equation , which is based on momentum space partial wave decomposition , we refer to @xcite . as an example we checked that at the energy @xmath17   mev the np and nn qfs cross section are practically insensitive to the exchange between different realistic nn potentials and that the effects of 3nf s are negligible ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the cross section @xmath18 for the nd breakup reaction @xmath19 under exact qfs condition ( @xmath20 ) as a function of the laboratory angle @xmath21 of the outgoing nucleon @xmath22 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show nn and np qfs cross sections for configurations measured in ref . @xcite .",
    "since the qfs cross section is practically insensitive to the action of a 3nf the reason for the nearly @xmath23 underestimation of the nn qfs cross section data found in @xcite must be traced to the underlying nn force . at low energy",
    "the largest contribution should be provided by the s - wave components of the nn potential . in case of free np and nn scattering",
    "these are the @xmath0(np)+@xmath1 and @xmath0(nn ) contributions , respectively . for the nd breakup and np or nn qfs configurations that dominance",
    "can also be expected . however , due to the presence of an additional nucleon in the incoming deuteron , for nn qfs also a smaller contribution from the @xmath1 np interaction is possible . in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] we show contributions to the np and nn qfs cross sections from @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and from all other components of the nn interaction up to a two - body total angular momentum @xmath24 .",
    "it is clearly seen , that at low energies the qfs peak is build predominantely from @xmath0 and @xmath25 components , with practically negligible contributions from higher angular momentum states .",
    "it is also seen that quite different pictures arise for np and nn qfs .",
    "while for np qfs @xmath1 is the most dominant contribution , for nn qfs it is the @xmath0 force which contributes decisively . if the disagreement between data and theory in the nn qfs peak has its source in one or both of these two force components it must be the @xmath0 nn force .",
    "the @xmath0 nn force is determined up to now only indirectly due to lack of free nn data .",
    "both @xmath0 and @xmath1 np forces are well determined by np scattering data and by the deuteron properties .",
    "also the agreement for np qfs found in @xcite further supports the possibility of a wrong nn @xmath0 interaction .",
    "namely if qfs resembles free nucleon - nucleon scattering then the @xmath0 contribution to the nn qfs should be mostly of the @xmath0 nn type whereas the @xmath0 contribution to the np qfs is mostly given by the @xmath0 np force component .",
    "that would imply that the nn qfs is a powerfull tool to study @xmath0 nn force component .",
    "our numerical studies revealed , that at low energies higher order rescatterings are important . as a result quasi - free - scattering",
    "does not resemble exactly free scattering and in the nn qfs peak also contributions from @xmath1 and @xmath0 np are present as well as in the np qfs peak there is also a small admixture from @xmath0 nn together with admixture in both , nn and np qfs s , from higher partial wave components .",
    "nevertheless the low energy dominance of the @xmath0 nn contribution in the nn qfs peak and the dominance of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 np forces in the np qfs peak remains true also in the presence of rescatterings .",
    "that indeed the nn qfs is extremely sensitive to the @xmath0 nn force component we demonstrate in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] by showing the changes of the qfs cross section induced by changes of the nn @xmath0 interaction . in this study",
    "we chosse a very simple device for that change , namely multiplying the @xmath0 nn matrix element of the cd bonn potential by a factor @xmath26 .",
    "the result is , that the nn qfs undergoes significant variations while the np qfs cross sections are practically unchanged .",
    "going to higher energies the qfs cross sections become sensitive also to higher angular momentum components of the nn interaction and the dominance of s - waves is lost . also the sensitivity of the nn qfs peak to changes of the @xmath0 nn interaction is significantly reduced .",
    "this is demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] at @xmath27  mev .",
    "one can ask which change of the @xmath0 nn force is required to bring the nn qfs theoretical cross sections into agreement with the data . to remove the @xmath28 discrepancy found in @xcite for nn qfs would require a value of @xmath29 . such an increased strength of the @xmath0 nn interaction would drastically decrease @xmath0 nn scattering length @xmath30 to @xmath31  fm and would lead to a nearly bound state of two neutrons .",
    "here we perform corresponding studies for the nd sst break up configuration .",
    "even such a drastic increase of the nn @xmath0 force strength by a factor @xmath29 would not remove the discrepancy for the nd sst configuration . also here",
    "the main contributions to the cross section come from the @xmath0 and @xmath1 components .",
    "contrary to nn qfs here the @xmath1 is the dominant component .",
    "the building up of the sst cross sections in @xmath12  mev and @xmath10  mev nd breakup by components of the nn force is shown in the upper panels of figs .",
    "[ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] , respectively , and the sensitivity to the nn @xmath0 force in the lower panels of figs .",
    "[ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] .",
    "it is seen that changes which would provide an explanation for the nn qfs have practically no effect on the sst discrepancy .",
    "summarizing , the qfs nd breakup cross sections are influenced only slightly by present day 3nf s .",
    "thus they are not responsible for the large differences between theoretical predictions and data found for the nd breakup nn qfs cross sections .",
    "the study of the sensitivity of these cross sections to different nn force components has shown , that in order to explain these discrepancies a stronger nn @xmath0 force is required , leading however in our simplistic modification to an unrealistic nn scattering length .",
    "the sst discrepancy is even more serious .",
    "further measurements are required to solidify the experimental situation .",
