    "the phase diagram of the cuprates , like , e.g. , @xmath1 ( lsco ) , is characterized by three distinct regions which are reached by varying the doping @xmath2 : ( i ) the overdoped region , where the system displays a markedly metallic character , which can be reasonably described within the standard fermi - liquid picture ; ( ii ) the region around optimal doping , where the superconducting critical temperature @xmath3 is maximum , and no other energy scale besides the temperature @xmath4 is seen in various experiments , so that the metallic phase above @xmath3 strongly deviates from the fermi - liquid behavior ; ( iii ) the underdoped region where , on the contrary , there is an abundance of energy scales , and an even stronger violation of the fermi - liquid behavior .",
    "these are related to a doping - dependent temperature @xmath5 , below which a suppression of the density of states at the fermi level is revealed in static measurements and to a doping - dependent temperature @xmath0 below which various experiments reveal a pseudogap @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath0 strongly depends on the characteristic time scale of the probe used to measure the pseudogap properties . other energy scales of the underdoped phase are the superconducting gap @xmath7 and the critical temperature @xmath3 .    the generic partition of the phase diagram into three qualitatively quite distinct regions with markedly different behaviors and the absence of any energy scale but the temperature in the intermediate ( optimally doped ) region , suggest the presence of a quantum critical point ( qcp ) near optimal doping @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , the identification of the optimally doped region with the region where quantum critical fluctuations are present naturally accounts for the peculiar non - fermi - liquid behavior .",
    "various proposals have been made to specify the broken symmetry phase to be associated with the underdoped region , ranging from a circulating - current phase @xcite , to a change in symmetry of the superconducting order parameter @xcite .",
    "the scenario that we have been proposing along the years @xcite is related to the occurrence of an instability for charge ordering ( co ) , along a line @xmath8 ending in the qcp near optimal doping @xcite .",
    "this proposal of a ( dynamical ) co instability finds support from neutron scattering experiments in ne - doped lsco @xcite and @xmath9 systems @xcite , where charge domain walls ( stripes ) have been detected .    in this paper , by extending previous results , we account for the various pseudogap - formation temperatures and give a reason why formed stripes may be present in some classes of cuprates and be absent in other classes .",
    "we also address the issue of the anomalous isotopic effects of @xmath3 and @xmath0 in the cuprates and provide a novel mechanism based on the relevance of co fluctuations .",
    "the above co scenario found one of its possible realizations within a minimal model of strongly correlated electrons interacting with phonons , i.e. , the one - band hubbard - holstein ( hh ) model in the presence of long - range coulomb forces @xcite . in this model",
    "there is a hopping term @xmath10 representing the electron kinetic energy , a ( large ) on - site hubbard repulsion @xmath11 , representing the strong electron - electron ( e - e ) correlation , a coupling @xmath12 between a local lattice distortion and the local electron density , a phonon frequency @xmath13 , characterizing the relevant lattice distortion , and a long - range e - e coulomb repulsion @xmath14 .",
    "the simplification with respect to models taking into account the complex structure of the cuprates was adopted for two main reasons : first of all it makes the model manageable despite the formal complications related to the treatment of strong e - e correlations via the slave - boson large-@xmath15 expansion formalism .",
    "moreover it allows to concentrate on the relevant aspects providing both a non - fermi - liquid behavior and a strong pairing mechanism .",
    "although the relevant features related to quantum criticality should be generic , different cuprates should of course show different aspects related to their specific structure .",
    "two major results were obtained within the hh model @xcite .",
    "first of all , at mean field , one obtains the @xmath16 phase diagram reported in fig .",
    "1 with a line of the electron - phonon ( e - ph ) coupling @xmath12 as a function of the doping @xmath2 . this line marks a second - order transition for the onset of co characterized by an order parameter @xmath17 representing the microscopic charge modulation at a wave vector @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "each point on the curve @xmath19 is a qcp , which is the @xmath16 end point of a critical line @xmath20 .",
    "secondly , charge collective fluctuations mediate a doping- and temperature - dependent singular scattering among the quasiparticles @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a residual repulsion , @xmath23 is the strength of the singular interaction , @xmath24 is a characteristic time scale of the charge fluctuations , and @xmath25 is the inverse square correlation length , which measures the distance from criticality .",
    "this interaction diverges at @xmath26 and at a critical wave vector @xmath18 when @xmath25 vanishes .",
    "this occurs at @xmath16 when the doping is reduced down to a mean - field critical value @xmath27 , and at finite @xmath4 , when approaching the mean - field critical line @xmath20 . as we discuss in sec .",
    "ii b , the co fluctuations beyond mean field shift the mean - field critical line @xmath28 to a lower value @xmath8 , ending in the fluctuation - corrected qcp at @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , and modify accordingly the expression for the coherence length @xmath31 .",
    "the singular part of the interaction ( [ gamma ] ) ( with @xmath32 if fluctuations are taken into account ) is attractive both in the particle - particle and in the particle - hole channels .",
    "therefore , the quasiparticles feel an increasingly strong attraction by approaching the co critical line . in the particle - hole channel",
    ", this interaction can produce a pseudogap due to the incipient co. at the same time in the particle - particle channel , the strong attraction can lead to pair formation even in the absence of phase coherence @xcite .",
    "therefore the pseudogap - formation temperature @xmath33 closely tracks the underlying co transition line .",
    "we point out that the assumption of an infinitely large hubbard repulsion @xmath11 and the large-@xmath15 expansion do not allow for a correct description of the spin degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "however , at large but finite @xmath11 the above scenario is not expected to drastically change , except that the modulation of the charge profile within the co state should favor antiferromagnetic ordering in the charge - poor regions .",
    "this state with charge and ( enslaved ) spin modulation mimics the stripe phase observed in the cuprates , when approaching it from the large - doping side , where charge degrees of freedom play a major role .",
    "enslaved nearly critical antiferromagnetic fluctuations with a characteristic wave vector @xmath34 are expected to mediate an interaction similar to eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) in the particle - particle channel , which becomes repulsive in the cooper channel .",
    "this additional contribution is relevant to properly reproduce the main features of the single - particle spectra @xcite .",
    "the @xmath35-wave symmetry of the superconducting order parameter , which is already favored by the residual repulsive term in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) @xcite , is further stabilized by the antiferromagnetic fluctuations .      the separation between the homogeneous phase and the co phase at @xmath16 , reported in fig .",
    "1 , is marked by a line having a minimum value @xmath36 , below which no co ( or stripes ) could be formed as a static phase . of course strong quantum fluctuations mediating the singular scattering ( [ gamma ] ) , which leads to pairing and non - fermi - liquid behavior in the normal phase ,",
    "would be present both above and below the quantum critical line .",
    "the crucial point in obtaining the co instability is that strong electronic correlations reduce the effect of the homogenizing electron kinetic - energy term , thus favoring the possibility of an instability induced by a residual interaction , which in our model is provided by the e - ph interaction .",
    "the relevant role of the lattice in driving the instability is , indeed , strongly suggested by the peculiar isotopic effect of @xmath0 and @xmath3 @xcite and by recent exafs experiments @xcite , which identified interesting features associated to the lattice structure .",
    "specifically a microstrain @xmath37 of the cu - o bonds was measured in terms of the deviation of the cu - o distance with respect to a reference distance @xmath38 , which introduces a mismatch in the lattice between the cuo@xmath39 layers and the rock - salt layers .",
    "actually there is a close resemblance between the experimental @xmath40 and the theoretical @xmath41 phase diagrams indicating that the cu - o microstrain and the e - ph coupling @xmath12 of the simplified hh model are strictly related .",
    "from the microscopic point of view it is indeed quite natural that a lattice contraction in the cuo@xmath39 planes can enhance the effective coupling between the electrons and the ions .",
    "therefore the comparison between experiments and theory allows to draw the conclusion that a one - to - one monotonic relation @xmath42 is likely to exist .",
    "once this general framework is settled , one can move to identify more detailed possible scenarios .",
    "in particular the order of the homogeneous - metal to charge - ordered - metal transition is of obvious relevance .",
    "the simplest possibility is that in the real materials this transition is of the second order . in this case , at @xmath16 , the different microstrains determined by the rock - salt layers directly correspond to different e - ph couplings and are reflected in the similar phase diagrams .",
    "of course this simple theoretical picture is not necessarily realized in the quite complex real materials where i ) anharmonic effects and/or ii ) additional non - ordering fields can partially or entirely transform the second - order transition into a first - order one . in this last case ,",
    "the above scenario maintains its validity , as long as this transition is _ weakly _ first - order .",
    "we stressed in several papers @xcite that the actual onset of a fully developed co phase is competing with local or coherent pair formation , which modifies the fermionic spectrum stabilizing the system against the electronic co transition .",
    "there is the complementary possibility that the charge - ordered state can never be reached because @xmath12 is below @xmath36 .",
    "the corresponding observable quantity identified by the experiments in ref .",
    "@xcite is the critical microstrain @xmath43 , below which no stripe phase can be observed .",
    "therefore the cuprates can deviate from co criticality not only by @xmath44 in the ( overdoped ) quantum - disordered region , and by @xmath4 or @xmath45 in the quantum - critical or underdoped region , but also because the microstrain @xmath37 is smaller or larger than @xmath43 , thereby tending to a homogeneous or an inhomogeneous phase respectively .",
    "as long as @xmath46 is not too large and @xmath4 is finite , for @xmath47 the quantum - critical region , with strong dynamical fluctuations , can be reached in both cases . according to the proposed mechanism of pairing mediated by critical fluctuations ,",
    "the stronger are these fluctuations and the larger is @xmath3 . indeed in the experiment the mercury compound hg1212 , having @xmath48 , has the the largest @xmath3 , while hg1201 ( with @xmath49 ) and bi2212 or lsco ( with @xmath50 ) have a lower @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath49 in hg1201 , we expect no @xmath8 , and therefore no @xmath0 , for this material .      in this section",
    "we calculate the temperature for the onset of the co instability within the mean - field approximation , @xmath28 , and its corrected value , @xmath8 , in the presence of the leading fluctuations beyond mean field . for establishing the onset of the co phase coming from high - doping and high - temperature regime",
    ", the direct involvement of the spin degrees of freedom can be safely ignored .",
    "for @xmath51 the co fluctuations become substantial , leading to a reduction of the quasiparticle density of states .",
    "we therefore identify our mean - field line @xmath28 with the weak - pseudogap crossover line @xmath52 observed in knight - shift , transport , and static susceptibility measurements @xcite , as the incipient reduction of the quasiparticle density of states .",
    "the fluctuation - corrected critical line @xmath8 [ @xmath53 , where the correlation length @xmath31 diverges , and the scattering ( [ gamma ] ) becomes effectively singular , is instead closely tracked by the pseudogap crossover line @xmath33 , according to the discussion of sec .",
    "all the complicated formal structure of the quasiparticle scattering , mediated by phonons and by the coulomb interaction within the slave - boson approach , is , at the end , simply represented , at least near criticality , by a rpa resummation @xmath54 $ ] of an effective static interaction @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "here @xmath56 is the fermionic polarization bubble , @xmath57 is the dimensionless e - ph coupling , and @xmath58 is the residual short - range repulsion between quasiparticles , and @xmath59 is the fourier transform of the e - e coulomb repulsion . for the correspondence of @xmath60 with the parameters of the original hh model see ref .",
    "the mean - field co instability condition , which occurs for reasonable values @xmath61 , is @xmath62 . at @xmath16",
    "this determines @xmath18 and the position of the mean - field qcp @xmath27 . by expanding @xmath63 near the instability at @xmath16 , we find @xmath64 . at @xmath65 ,",
    "considering the @xmath4 dependence of the bare polarization bubble @xmath56 , the instability condition determines the mean - field critical line @xmath28 ( the solid - line curves in fig .",
    "2 ) , which ends at @xmath27 .",
    "we evaluate @xmath28 by taking standard quasiparticle ( i.e. , dressed by the slave bosons ) band parameters ( @xmath66 mev , @xmath67 mev , leading to @xmath68 mev and @xmath69 mev in the residual repulsion @xmath70 ) .",
    "@xmath71 mev and @xmath72 mev are adjusted to match with the extrapolated experimental values of @xmath52 for lsco @xcite ( @xmath73 ) with the mean - field qcp @xmath27 . without any further adjustment of the parameters",
    "the curve @xmath28 agrees remarkably well with the experimental data for @xmath52 .",
    "similar parameters are taken for bi2212 to fit the data in refs .",
    "@xcite , with @xmath71 ev and @xmath74 ev .    due to the strong anisotropy of the layered cuprates , the contribution of the fluctuations related to any instability is significant @xcite .",
    "specifically the co fluctuations which mediate the critical effective interaction , eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) , can be included in the polarization bubble @xmath56 ( entering the instability condition ) via the diagrams of fig .",
    "3 , leading to corrections beyond rpa . from the explicit evaluation of these diagrams",
    "we find the self - consistent correction to the inverse square correlation length @xmath75 where @xmath76 are the bosonic matsubara frequencies , and the coupling constant @xmath77 .",
    "since the phonons are responsible for the instability , @xmath13 appears as the frequency cut - off @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation - corrected instability condition is @xmath78 .",
    "as it stands , eq .",
    "( [ mass1 ] ) is written for the two - dimensional cu - o planes . at @xmath16 ,",
    "( [ mass1 ] ) with @xmath78 leads to a finite shift of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) qcp @xmath79 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . at finite @xmath4",
    ", purely 2d fluctuations suppress the transition .",
    "however , by considering the more realistic anisotropic 3d character of the critical fluctuations , we obtain a finite fluctuation - corrected transition line @xmath8 , which is reported as the lowest dashed line in fig",
    "thus , the inclusion of fluctuations brings the critical line from temperatures of the order of typical electronic energies ( @xmath80 ) down to much lower temperatures @xmath81 of the order of the observed @xmath0 s .    the spread in the measured values of @xmath0 depending on the typical frequency of the experimental probe @xmath82 ( see ,",
    "e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) suggests , however , within our identification of @xmath81 with @xmath0 , that the co instability may be `` dynamical '' . in this case , the critical condition @xmath78 is replaced by @xmath83 in the self - consistency condition , eq .",
    "( [ mass1 ] ) .",
    "two examples are reported in fig.2 for @xmath84 mev ( dot - dashed line in figs .",
    "2(a , b ) , typical of neutron scattering experiments , and @xmath85ev ( second dashed line from bottom in fig .",
    "2(a ) , typical of static experiments ( nqr , nmr ) .",
    "the corresponding experimental data for @xmath0 in lsco are also reported for comparison .",
    "the coupling @xmath23 between the charge fluctuations and the quasiparticles , which is the only parameter for which an a priori estimate is difficult , is fixed by matching the position of the fluctuation - corrected qcp with the @xmath16 extrapolation of the experimental values of @xmath0 .",
    "we used @xmath86 ev@xmath87 and @xmath88 ev@xmath87 for lsco and bi2212 respectively , and @xmath89 ev for both .",
    "note that , similarly to the case of @xmath28 , the agreement between the calculated @xmath8 and the experimental points for @xmath0 is obtained without adjustment of other parameters .",
    "in the present framework , any mechanism shifting the position of the qcp and the line @xmath8 is mirrored by a corresponding shift of the superconducting critical line @xmath90 and of the pseudogap formation temperature @xmath33 .",
    "this is the case of the shift induced by isotopic substitution , and we want to connect our results with the observation of isotopic effects on @xmath3 @xcite and on @xmath0 @xcite . as shown in sec .",
    "ii a , the mean - field weak - pseudogap crossover temperature @xmath91 depends on the phonon frequency only through the dimensionless e - ph coupling @xmath92 , which is known to display no isotopic dependence .",
    "therefore @xmath93 , and consequently @xmath5 and the portion of @xmath90 near and above @xmath52 , are not expected to display isotope effects .    on the other hand , the co fluctuations , as shown above , crucially involve @xmath13 , and new physical effects can be induced by the isotopic substitutions , on fluctuation - dependent physical quantities , such as @xmath29 and @xmath8 . since @xmath13 decreases with increasing ionic mass , the effect of fluctuations is reduced , and @xmath29 and @xmath8 remain closer to their mean - field values . in fig .",
    "4 , we report the line @xmath8 , calculated via eq .",
    "( [ mass1 ] ) , with the same parameters used in sec .",
    "ii b to fit the @xmath0 data of lsco , together with its isotopic shift calculated for @xmath94 substitution ( i.e. , for a five percent reduction of @xmath13 ) .",
    "4 . calculated effect of the isotopic change @xmath95 ( i.e. @xmath67 mev and @xmath96 mev ) on @xmath0 in lsco , both for a fast- and a slow - probe measurement .",
    "the inferred shift on @xmath3 is also reported , although hardly visible on this scale .",
    "contrary to standard theories based on co pseudogap @xcite , the isotopic shift is positive ( i.e. anomalous ) for @xmath97 .",
    "moreover , if the slope of @xmath8 is large , a small isotopic shift in @xmath29 can result in a substantial shift in @xmath97 , i.e. , the steeper is @xmath0 , the larger is the isotopic effect . since the slope of @xmath8 increases by increasing @xmath82 , whereas the qcp is unshifted , the isotope effect on @xmath97 is enhanced , and we have the general trend that faster probes should detect a larger isotope effect on @xmath0 . although we can not account for the near - absent or negative isotope effect on @xmath0 within the almost static probes in @xmath98 @xcite , this general trend is in qualitative agreement with a much stronger effect observed in the isostructural @xmath99 ( hbco-124 ) with fast neutron scattering @xcite .",
    "indeed , this fast - probe experiment should be represented by the curve @xmath8 corresponding to @xmath84 mev in fig .",
    "4 . the huge isotope effect on @xmath0 observed in hbco-124 suggests that the curve @xmath8 in this system is steeper than in lsco .",
    "as far as @xmath3 in the underdoped region is concerned , we can only infer some expected consequences .",
    "assuming that the shift in @xmath29 produces a rigid shift of @xmath90 along the doping axis , the isotopic effect for @xmath3 is negative ( i.e. normal ) upon reducing @xmath13 , and much smaller than for @xmath0 ( the @xmath90 curve being much flatter ) , in agreement with long - standing experiments @xcite .",
    "this large difference in the isotope effect for @xmath3 and @xmath0 , @xmath100 , is indeed experimentally observed in hbco-124 , and reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a `` striking similarity between isotopic substitution and underdoping with respect to both @xmath3 and @xmath0 '' is pointed out .",
    "although we are not aware of any systematic analysis of the doping dependencies of @xmath3 , @xmath0 and their isotopic shifts in hbco-124 , allowing for a strict comparison , this observation finds its natural interpretation within our theory , where the isotopic substitution increases @xmath29 and is therefore nearly equivalent to underdoping .    in the strongly underdoped materials , where substantial isotope effects in the penetration depth @xcite and in the x - ray absorption @xcite have been observed , our results can provide only qualitative indications , as other effects ( magnetic , polaronic , lattice - pinning ) not included in our",
    "hh model become relevant .",
    "in conclusion we have revisited the co scenario , and explicitly evaluated the mean - field and the fluctuation - corrected critical lines , @xmath28 and @xmath8 , for the onset of the charge inhomogeneous phase , which should represent the stripe phase of the cuprates , when present .",
    "the nearly singular effective interaction among the electrons mediated by the co fluctuations near the instability , suggests the natural identification of the experimentally observed weak - pseudogap crossover line @xmath52 with @xmath28 , and of the pseudogap formation temperature @xmath0 with @xmath8 .",
    "we obtain in this way a good fitting of the experimental data , and by assuming that the co transition has a dynamical character , we account for the spread of the measurements of @xmath33 , depending on the characteristic time scale of the experimental probe .",
    "the existence of the co transition , depending on the strength of the e - ph coupling , as produced by our zero - temperature phase diagram , can give an answer to the puzzling question why features of formed stripes are present in some cuprates and absent in others .",
    "the co instability condition at mean - field level depends only on the dimensionless e - ph coupling which is not changed by isotopic substitution .",
    "therefore , in our model , @xmath28 should not undergo any isotopic shift . on the contrary , @xmath8 , and therefore @xmath0 ,",
    "are strongly modified by the effect of co fluctuations , which in our approach is proportional to the phonon frequency @xmath13 . within our model ,",
    "therefore , @xmath0 shows a novel isotope effect produced by charge fluctuations , with a positive shift , which depends on the slope of @xmath8 .",
    "it results , therefore , that the isotope effect is stronger when detected with faster probes .",
    "we also infer that @xmath90 should have no isotope effect in the optimal and overdoped regimes , and a small negative effect in the underdoped region , which increases upon underdoping . in this new isotope effect",
    ", the phonon do not appear directly as mediators of pairing , but are indirectly involved , via the co fluctuations , and qualitatively explain the complex behavior of @xmath0 and @xmath3 upon isotopic substitution .",
