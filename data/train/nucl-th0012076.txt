    "the experimental and theoretical investigation of electromagnetic properties of particles or composite systems like atomic nuclei has a long tradition ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) , which is well known to be intimately related to the polarization properties of such systems ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the objective of the presented work is not to prove or disprove the impressive amount of previous work on this issue , yet to draw the attention of the physical community to two subtile points being hardly refered to in the vast list of present publications , yet yielding substantial quantitative uncertainties in the interpretation of theoretical results in comparison with experimental data . throughout",
    "the work presented an unique prescription will be given how to circumvent these uncertainties , in order to come to an unambiguous notation and result .",
    "the first point is the uncertainty in fixing or extracting the absolut sign of and the relative phase between different electromagnetic multipole moments of systems under consideration .",
    "the source of uncertainty and mistakes is here on one hand the various conventions in notation appearing in literature , the different ( spacelike or timelike euclidean or minkowski ) metrics used diag@xmath0 with @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 . ] , the different defining relations for the four - momentum transfer @xmath4 and the absolut sign of the elementary charge unit @xmath5 , which may lead to different results . on the other hand",
    "there is still a sizable uncertainty in relating cartesian to spherical multipole moments depending on their definition by different authors . in polarization ,",
    "i.e.  spin physics this problem is partially cured by the so called basel @xcite and madison @xcite convention , while in the description of electromagnetic current distributions a wide community of authors is still very ambiguous in their notations .",
    "the second point is related to the fact that electromagnetic current distributions , formfactors and corresponding multipole moments are  due to experimental purposes  defined and experimentally detected in configuration space , while  due to technical reasons  in most cases calculated by theoreticians in momentum space . in configuration space",
    "the calculation of electromagnetic multipole moments yields integrals over the product of the configuration space current distribution and special combinations of space coordinates , while in momentum space  after performing the respective fourier transform and a partial integration  the corresponding momentum integrals show up to contain momentum derivatives acting on the fourier transform of the current distribution at places where in configuration space the space coordinates explicitely appeared ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the problem is , that nowadays many theoreticians give or refer to defining equations of electromagnetic formfactors in momentum space , which are incomplete with respect to their exact definition in configuration space , as they ingore a gross part of the derivative terms mentioned above . yet",
    "an exact definition of electromagnetic formfactors in momentum space is crucial to compare the various theoretical calculations present among each other and with experiment , especially at high momentum transfers , where results are most sensitive to the derivative terms mentioned .    in order to clarify the two points i want to consider already at this place the matrix element @xmath6 of the current density operator @xmath7 between incoming and outgoing _ onshell _ state vectors of four - momentum @xmath8 , @xmath9 and spin - quantum numbers @xmath10 and @xmath11 for a vector particle ( @xmath12 ) of mass @xmath13 , which under restriction of translational invariance ( upto an overall velocity dependent term @xmath14 ) is a function of the four - momentum transfer @xmath15 and under additional restrictions of lorentz - convariance and time - reversal invariance parametrized according to e.g.  @xcite by three formfactors @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( see also section [ sec3 ] and [ appd1 ] ) : @xmath19 \\pm \\delta^{\\,\\mu\\nu}_{\\rho\\sigma}\\ , q_\\nu \\ ; g_1 ( q^2 )    \\bigg ] \\ , \\varepsilon^{\\,\\sigma \\",

    "the quadrupole formfactors given in ( [ idad1 ] ) will be shown in the following text . as has been discussed above the reason",
    "is that the identifying expressions ( [ idad1 ] ) for @xmath38 and @xmath39 do nt contain contributions of small , yet relevant terms with momentum derivatives of the formfactors @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in several calculations",
    "such contributions give finite results even for @xmath43 , which are part of the so called _ intrinsic contributions _ to the electromagnetic multipole moments of the vector particle @xcite .",
    "as will be shown in the case of the charge formfactor no derivatives appear , i.e. the identification for @xmath44 given in ( [ idad1 ] ) is exact and the charge does not get any further correction from an intrinsic contribution .    the sign ambiguity in ( [ rel0 ] ) denoted by @xmath45 ( affected by the choice of the sign of elementary charge unit @xmath5 ) causes to several authors problems , who do nt know how to fix the sign properly .",
    "in general authors make the identification @xmath46 , yet choose the signs in front of @xmath42 in the expressions for @xmath44 and @xmath39 according to formulae taken from different articles quoted  often negative , even for positive unit charge . in the comparison to experiment ",
    "say in elastic electron - deuteron scattering  this sign ambiguity seem to play a marginal role , especially for very small momentum transfers .",
    "e.g.  the well known rosenbluth formfactors @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which usually are identified by ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) @xmath49 depend only on the square of @xmath50 , which is insensitive to the sign of @xmath42 .",
    "yet at least the formfactor @xmath47 depends also on @xmath51 , which is sensitive to the sign of @xmath42 for @xmath52 . in the case of the deuteron for small @xmath53 the quadrupole formfactor",
    "is dominated by @xmath54 , as there holds approximately the following proportionality @xmath55 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , yet for larger negative values of @xmath53 their relative weights change drastically , so a sign change or wrong sign in front of @xmath42 or intrinsic contributions to electromagnetic formfactors can be quantitatively very relevant .",
    "the same is of course true for the tensor polarization @xmath56 , which is usually introduced by the following identification @xcite : @xmath57 with @xmath58 the reason , why a questionmark is put on all identifications of @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath56 with @xmath59 , @xmath50 , @xmath60 ( equations ( [ idad2 ] ) and ( [ idad3 ] ) ) is , that they all are derived by comparison of expressions for the differential cross section of elastic electron - deuteron scattering containing @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath56 with theoretical results derived via the matrix element ( [ rel0 ] ) of the current distribution operator given in terms of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and later reexpressed by @xmath59 , @xmath50 , @xmath60 given by the inexact identifying equations ( [ idad1 ] ) discussed above .",
    "future calculations will have to take this issue with much greater care .",
    "the goal of this publication is to give an unambiguous exact definition in configuration space and derivation in momentum space of the ( onshell ) electromagnetic formfactors of particles or composite systems with arbitrary spin in terms from the breit - frame matrix elements of the current - distribution operator , without knowledge , whether the matrix element of the current - distribution operator can be decomposed into polarization vectors or not .",
    "a first application of this formalism with respect to the deuteron within a bethe - salpeter framework is already available @xcite .",
    "it turns out , that intrinsic contributions to electromagnetic formfactors have sizable effects .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section [ sec2 ] the electromagnetic multipole moments of a classical current distribution in configuration space and momentum space are defined and reconsidered ; in section [ sec3 ] after extending the formalism within the breit - frame to a current distribution in quantum - field theory ( qft ) consistent expressions for the electric and magnetic formfactors and multipole moments in qft are derived ; section [ sec4 ] is closing with a summary and a short outlook .",
