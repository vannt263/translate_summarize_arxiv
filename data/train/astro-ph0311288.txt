    "the primordial binary population ( pbp ) is defined as the population of binaries as established just after the gas has been removed from the forming system , i.e. when the stars can no longer accrete gas from their surroundings @xcite . characterizing the pbp is important for our understanding of the process of star formation , the formation and evolution of ob associations , the origin of the field star population and ob runaway stars , and the production and evolution of binary systems .",
    "ob associations are ideal sites for the study of the pbp .",
    "since ob associations are young ( @xmath0  myr ) and low density ( @xmath1 ) stellar systems , the effects of stellar and dynamical evolution are modest .",
    "ob associations are practically cleared of gas and the full stellar population ( from ob stars to brown dwarfs ) is present .",
    "sco  ob2 ( figure  [ figure : eps ] ) is the closest young ob association , its proximity facilitating the detection of close and faint companions .",
    "the membership and stellar content has been established with _",
    "@xcite , and many binary surveys have been performed in the past .",
    "we performed a near - infrared adaptive optics ( ao ) survey among 199 ( mainly ) a- and b - type stars .",
    "our sample is a subset of the _ hipparcos _ membership list of sco  ob2 @xcite .",
    "the ao observations bridge the observational gap between the wide visual and close spectroscopic binaries . in the near - infrared the luminosity contrast between the primary star and its ( often later - type ) companion(s )",
    "is lower , which facilitates the detection of faint and close companions .",
    "the observations were performed with the adonis / sharpii+ system .",
    "this ao system was mounted on the eso 3.6 m telescope on la silla .",
    "the camera field of view is @xmath2  arcsec .",
    "each star is observed at four different pointings in order to maximize the available field of view . the angular separation between the target stars and the other components in the field ranges between 0.2  and 15  arcsec .",
    "all target stars are observed in the @xmath3 band , for some also @xmath4 and @xmath5 band observations are obtained .",
    "we applied standard data reduction techniques in combination with image selection , retaining only the highest strehl ratio images .",
    "we find a total of 151 stellar components in the fields around the 199 target stars .",
    "for each detected component the projected distance , position angle , and relative magnitude are measured .",
    "the status of an observed component ( companion star or background star ) can be determined using the colour - magnitude diagram : companion stars are expected to lie on the isochrone , while background stars are not @xcite . for most of our target stars only the @xmath3 magnitude is available to determine whether a component is a companion star or a background star .",
    "we have used a simple brightness criterion to separate background and foreground stars .",
    "we consider all stars fainter than @xmath6 to be background stars , and the stars brighter than @xmath6 companion stars ( the magnitude of an m5v star at the distance of of sco  ob2 is @xmath6 ) . using this method",
    "we find 74 candidate companion stars and 77 probable background stars .",
    "we combine our observations with literature data on binary in sco  ob2 .",
    "this dataset includes visual , astrometric , spectroscopic , and eclipsing binaries .",
    "a careful comparison shows that 42 out of the 74 candidate companion stars that we found are new : 14 in us , 14 in ucl and 14 in lcc ( table  [ table : statistics ] ) .",
    "it was pointed out by @xcite that the observed number of multiple systems with a- and late b - type primaries is relatively low due to observational biases .",
    "part of this selection effect is now removed with our new ao observations ( figure  [ figure : eps ] ) .",
    ".multiplicity among _ hipparcos _ members of sco  ob2 .",
    "the columns show the subgroup names , their distances @xcite , the ages @xcite , the number of known single stars , binary stars , triple systems and @xmath7 systems .",
    "the last three columns show the binary statistics : the fraction of multiple systems @xmath8 , the fraction of stars in multiple systems @xmath9 and the companion star fraction @xmath10 , which measures the average number of companion stars per primary star .",
    "[ table : statistics ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the ultimate goal of our study is to determine the pbp .",
    "we will achieve this by combining the binary data of sco  ob2 with detailed numerical models .",
    "these models are n - body simulations including state of the art stellar and binary evolution @xcite .",
    "simulated observations will be produced to characterize in detail the selection effects for the different binary surveys .",
    "these simulations will also be used to investigate the impact of dynamical and evolutionary effects that may have altered the binary population over the lifetime of sco  ob2 .",
    "combined with the knowledge about the selection effects the pbp can then be reconstructed .",
    "the results will provide the characteristics of the binary population as a function of environment just after the star formation process has finished .",
    "this is an important constraint on theories of star ( cluster ) formation ."
