    "from within the circumference of brane world cosmology , many ideas and proposals relate to the work of randall and sundrum @xcite , who initially implemented their two brane model to try and solve the hierarchy problem . in the one brane variant of this model",
    "@xcite it was also shown that the extra dimension could be of infinite extent . in most contexts ,",
    "the second model ( and its extensions to include curved branes ) has been of more interest to the cosmology community because gravity behaves essentially like 4-dimensional gravity localised near the brane @xcite .    an interesting brane world scenario ( bws )",
    "has been developed in @xcite , known as the bulk inflaton model , where it is possible to obtain inflation on a single positive tension brane solely due to the presence of a bulk gravitational scalar field . in this regard , the vacuum energy of the bulk scalar field could have some affect on the cosmological evolution of the brane , ( depending on the size and sign of this quantity ) .",
    "the importance of vacuum energy in bws has also been highlighted in @xcite where it has been suggested that it may be possible to solve the hierarchy problem with two positive tension branes , if the back - reaction of the casimir effect is included ( also see @xcite ) .    in this article",
    "we evaluate the one - loop effective action for one and two de sitter brane configurations in a bulk 5-dimensional anti - de sitter spacetime .",

    "was employed to evaluate the effective potential for a massless conformally coupled scalar and fermion field and some special techniques were used for the graviton field .",
    "the possibility of radion stabilisation due to quantum effects was also studied , which gave a negative result .",
    "the dimensional reduction procedure was used in @xcite to obtain an effective four dimensional field with an infinite kk tower .",
    "the effective potential was then regularised using dimensional regularisation .",
    "fermion fields have also been considered in @xcite where the main emphasis was on fermion representations and topological symmetry breaking .",

    "there is no bound state and gravity can not be localised on the brane .",
    "however , the cocycle function interpolates between the original metric and the scaled one and therefore introduces distributional terms .",

    "cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ taba2 ]    it is important to discuss whether any of the terms in the cocycle function can be regarded as renormalisations of the original action .",
    "consider first of all the terms with coefficient @xmath120 .",
    "these terms are proportional to the volumes of the branes since , for example , the positive tension brane is a four - sphere of radius @xmath121 .",
    "we have only considered bulk fields , but in a more realistic theory there would also be matter fields on the brane which could give infinite renormalisations of the brane tensions .",
    "it would then make sense to absorb @xmath120 into a finite renormalisation .",
    "however , when there are two branes , the new terms take the same sign on the positive tension and the negative tension brane and it would be very unnatural to then suppose that the renormalised brane tensions could be exactly equal and opposite sign as they are in the randall - sundrum model .",
    "the terms with coefficients @xmath122 and @xmath123 are similar to brane curvature terms @xmath124 and curvature squared terms in the lagrangian .",
    "such terms may be desirable to renormalise away divergences from the brane fields , but they represent a significant departure from the models which we mentioned in the introduction . both the classical field equations and the quantisation would be modified .",
    "a possible resolution would be to regard the theory as a low energy approximation and restrict attention to theories in which the divergences from the brane fields vanish at one loop order .",
    "another feature becomes apparent when we examine the coefficients in equation ( [ fullc ] ) , which imply that the cocycle function combines brane curvature with extrinsic curvature terms .",
    "these can only be expressed in terms of brane curvature terms ( by the gauss - codacci relations ) in special cases .",
    "we conclude that the cocycle function should not be eliminated by renormalisation .",
    "combining the cocycle function with the cylinder result gives the total one loop effective action for the majorana fermion , @xmath125 where the coefficients are tabulated in table [ taba2 ] .",
    "for comparison , the conformal scalar effective actions are @xmath126 for dirichlet and robin boundary conditions , where @xmath127 was given in equation ( [ zpsphere ] ) .",
    "the results can be simplified in a variety of limiting cases .",
    "the curvatures of the branes are small when @xmath128 and they approximate the flat branes of the original randall - sundrum model .",
    "the conformal distance @xmath19 becomes small , @xmath129    the effective action for spin 1/2 fields , including the cocycle function , is then @xmath130 in effect , there is an effective potential on the negative tension brane defined by @xmath131 we can express this potential in terms of a radion field @xmath132 , @xmath133 where @xmath134 the result agrees with the flat space casimir energy for spin 1/2 fields calculated previously @xcite .",
    "some of these old results absorbed the first two terms into shifts in the brane tension .",
    "another limiting case is when the brane separation is small , @xmath135 .",
    "the conformal separation becomes @xmath136 and is small in this limit .",
    "the casimir energy @xmath137 is independent of the five dimensional cosmological constant .",
    "finally , the limit @xmath138 corresponds to large conformal separation and approaches the single brane limit . in this case",
    "@xmath139 the contribution to the effective action from the cylinder disappears as @xmath140 and we are left only with the cocycle function on the positive tension brane .",
    "the effective potential is then obtained by dividing by the finite 5-dimensional volume ( using the actual metric ) and this contribution still remains .",
    "note , on the cylinder the effective potential is zero , in the one brane limit , because the conformal volume is infinite , i.e. , the 5d volume is proportional to @xmath141 .",
    "we have discussed the effective action on curved brane backgrounds for conformally coupled scalar and spinor fields .",
    "the final formulae , which can be found at the end of section 4 , consist of a contribution from a region of the cylinder and a cocycle function resulting from a conformal rescaling of the background .",
    "perturbations around the conformal case from a mass have been considered in @xcite on the cylinder background .",
    "these terms make small corrections to the effective action . a mass , or small correction to the conformal coupling , will also contribute to the cocycle function .",
    "however , its generic form does not change from the case presented here .",
    "as we have seen , the cocycle function induces curvature terms and , in general , it is not possible to eliminate the cocycle function by renormalisation .",
    "however , some parts can be absorbed by renormalisation , for example as finite renormalisation of the brane tensions .",
    "other parts of the cocycle function are additional curvature terms .",
    "it has been known for some time that quantum fields on curved brane backgrounds give induced curvature terms ( for e.g. , see @xcite for induced terms in the rs model ) .    on the conformally related cylinder , the effective potential vanishes in the single brane limit .",
    "this is expected because , as first argued in @xcite , the background becomes a half - cylinder with infinite volume .",
    "however , using the actual metric the effective potential includes a contribution from the cocycle function , as we have shown .",
    "note that the volume of the spacetime ( after the usual wick rotation of the time ) is finite .",
    "therefore , we must be careful in interpreting any result on the conformally related cylinder .",
    "for a two brane configuration , the effective action on the cylinder is non - zero , because the cylindrical region is compact , and the cocycle function does not vanish .    in tables",
    "[ taba1 ] & [ taba2 ] we also separated out the part due to the delta function in the background potential .",
    "a puzzling point is that the result is not the same as what one would obtain for a thin but finite domain wall , for which the cocycle function would vanish .",
    "hence the thin wall limit will not agree with the case of the delta function potential .",
    "the physical reason behind this discrepancy is unclear .",
    "we leave this issue for future study . until it is resolved , the result for the delta function potential",
    "should perhaps be taken with care . in this connection",
    ", we note that the thin wall limit in bubble nucleation was analyzed in @xcite , and no anomalous behaviour was found .    when considering backreaction for conformally coupled fields , the semi - classical einstein equations are exact and the casimir energy can play an important role in bws @xcite , including inflating branes . for flat branes",
    "this only depends on the difference between the number of bosons ( @xmath142 ) and fermions ( @xmath143 ) , where @xmath144 gives the usual rs model and @xmath145 gives two positive tension branes , see @xcite . for de sitter branes we clearly see ( compare eq . (",
    "[ wm ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ ws ] ) ) that in general the contribution from scalar and fermion fields are not the same , as was argued in @xcite .",
    "thus , in this case , the bulk will not remain pure anti - de sitter under back - reaction even for @xmath144 .    as well as untwisted fields we also considered twisted fields ( see appendix a ) .",
    "this case occurs when one brane obeys dirichlet and the other neumann boundary conditions .",
    "in fact , _ a priori _ , there seems to be no requirement that a scalar field should only satisfy untwisted boundary conditions .",
    "one could then envisage a two brane set up with the positive tension brane satisfying neumann and the other negative tension brane satisfying dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "if this were the case then it should be possible to have a bound state localised on the positive tension brane even in a two brane set up .",
