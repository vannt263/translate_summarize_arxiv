    "the emergence of classical dynamics from the underlying quantum behaviour still continues to be one of the foremost questions in physics today .",
    "two ingredients essential to this transition are ( i ) the establishing of suitable `` classical '' correlations between appropriate coordinates and their conjugate momenta ( ie .",
    "classical equations of motion ) and ( ii ) the suppression or destruction of quantum correlations .",
    "the need for the former is self - evident while the latter is necessary to explain the general absence of macroscopic quantum superpositions . a paradigm which primarily addresses ( ii ) and which attempts to describe",
    "this transition is _",
    "decoherence_. in this school of thought , decoherence is the general term which describes a dynamical process whereby the quantum correlations in the system in question are diminished or destroyed .",
    "these processes can be split into those which deviate from ordinary quantum mechanics , eg .",
    "grw theory and quantum mechanical spontaneous localisation qmsl @xcite , and those processes which stay within the confines of quantum mechanics .",
    "we will only consider the latter in this paper .",
    "the two primary paradigms which attempt to describe the transition from quantum to classical using pure quantum mechanics are environmental induced superselection ( eis ) and consistent histories ( ch ) @xcite .",
    "although much has been written concerning these two theories , calculations comparing the two in non - trivial models are lacking .",
    "even in relatively simple models the computations quickly become lengthy and difficult to interpret . in this paper",
    "we examine the dynamics of a simple quantum optical system from the viewpoints of both eis and ch . upon comparison",
    "we find that they generally agree , that is , if eis occurs in a particular basis then histories in that basis become more consistent .    in section",
    "ii we derive the general solution to the quantum optical master equation in the markov regime for a system comprising of an harmonic oscillator linearly coupled to an infinite bath of harmonic oscillators with the usual quantum optical approximations .",
    "we solve for the evolution of the reduced density matrix of the system in the position , momentum , number and coherent state bases .",
    "in section iii we discuss eis in these bases using a general measure of `` diagonality '' which quantifies the peaking of the density matrix about the diagonal .",
    "this measure is sensitive to the coherence of the system state .",
    "we solve for the general behaviour of this measure in the position basis for an arbitrary initial system state and examine the particular case of a mixture of two coherent states .",
    "we find that eis occurs to some extent in all of the above bases with @xmath0 becomming more `` diagonal '' with time and increasing bath temperature .    in section",
    "iv we calculate the decoherence functional of ch for two - time projected coarse - grained histories on phase - space . as in all previous calculations ,",
    "we use quasi - projectors , that is , operators which are complete but are not exclusive , to define the coarse - grained histories on phase - space .",
    "we then compute the degree of consistency and peaking of the decoherence functional using measures advanced by dowker and halliwell @xcite .",
    "we find that the consistency and peaking behave as expected except for an anomalous _ decrease _ in consistency with increased initial grain size .",
    "this behaviour is also found in all previous calculations .",
    "we also adopt the above proposed measure for diagonality in the eis framework to quantify the `` coherence '' of the decoherence functional .",
    "we find a similar dependence of this measure on the model parameters to that displayed by the the dowker - halliwell measure . in the conclusion",
    "we discuss the results of the eis and ch calculations and the anomalous dependence of the consistency in the ch picture on the initial graining .",
    "we also discuss the legitimacy of using the `` coherence '' measure in the ch picture .",
    "we argue that in the case of a set of many alternatives , this `` coherence '' measure gives a good indication that the probability sum rule is met to the given degree .    before examining the dynamics of the quantum optical master equation",
    "we first make a few remarks concerning both the eis and ch scenarios .",
    "environmentally induced superselection was primarily developed by zurek in the early 1980 s @xcite in relation to quantum non - demolition measurements of gravitational wave antennas . since then",
    ", the theory has steadily evolved to encompass more complicated and realistic models . essentially , the system in question is coupled to a large external bath via a particular interaction with hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "if the interaction is such that the reduced density matrix of the system becomes approximately diagonal in a particular basis in a time much less than the relaxation time then we say eis has occurred .",
    "the process is aimed primarily at removing the quantum coherence from the system .",
    "the system s reduced density matrix in this particular basis is approximately diagonal and is given a purely ignorance interpretation .",
    "that is , the system is now in one of the states on the diagonal but we do not know which one .",
    "a number of calculations have shown that in some cases eis is very successful and can damp away the quantum superpositions very quickly indeed @xcite .",
    "other models have shown however , that the spectral properties of environment play a significant role in determining the decoherence time @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will work with the standard ohmic environment .",
    "it is also the case that the initial conceptions of eis have changed .",
    "the concept of a pointer basis @xmath2 , the particular basis in which the reduced density matrix becomes diagonal , strictly holds only in those models for which the interaction hamiltonian commutes with the number operator of the pointer basis @xmath3 . for more realistic cases and for the models treated in this paper ,",
    "no exact pointer basis exist . work on a suitable generalization of the concept of a pointer basis ,",
    "that is , a system basis which is least effected by the interaction with the bath , is currently being pursued @xcite .",
    "also , there does not appear to be a general concrete description concerning the `` diagonality '' of a reduced density matrix in a particular basis .",
    "some measures have been advanced for gaussian states .",
    "for particular non - gaussian states a fringe visibility measure based on the appearance of the wigner function has been proposed @xcite .",
    "this however , appears to quantify the amount of interference in the state rather than the coherence .",
    "eis is the process whereby the reduced state of the system deviates more and more from a description as a single ray in hilbert space .",
    "such a process reduces the interferences present in the state .",
    "however , pure states , with unitary evolution , can display little interference .",
    "such processes do not display eis . with this in mind",
    "we propose and investigate a measure of the `` diagonality '' of the state in a number of bases in a quantum optical model .",
    "we find that the coherence of the reduced density matrix of the system decays and gives clear evidence of eis in a number of bases .",
    "however , the degree of diagonality depends on the basis chosen .",
    "it also depends on the model parameters in an expected manner , becoming more diagonal with increasing bath temperature .",
    "we have not examined the attainment of ( i ) above in the eis framework .",
    "this is because there appears to be some dispute concerning the quantification of classical correlations in the state .",
    "previously , some have examined the wigner function of the state for peaks @xcite .",
    "however , the wigner function is not a true probability distribution and does not correspond to the results of any conceivable measurement on the system .",
    "the @xmath4 function of quantum optics _ does _ correspond to the result of a particular measurement scheme @xcite .",
    "more generally , there exist true probability distribution functions corresponding to more general measurements @xcite . to establish the existence and to quantify `` classical '' correlations one should examine such distributions .",
    "work towards this goal is in progress @xcite .",
    "finally , the ignorance interpretation of the resulting diagonal reduced density matrix seems part and parcel of eis .",
    "this feature of the framework has surprisingly not attracted much attention in the literature .",
    "if eis is to describe a truly ontological reality then zurek s arguments may not suffice @xcite .",
    "it is clearly capable of describing an empirical reality @xcite but are it s aspirations higher than just such a description ?      in order not to confuse the reader with various different meanings of the term decoherence , we will refrain from the more usual nomenclature of `` decohering histories '' and use the more descriptive terminology ",
    "`` consistent histories '' .",
    "consistent histories was initially researched by griffiths and omns @xcite and later on independently rediscovered and greatly expanded on by gell - mann and hartle @xcite .",
    "this paradigm is more ambitious than that of eis as it attempts to describe the emergence of the complete quasi - classical world of familiar experience from the underlying quantum world .",
    "central to this framework is the notion of coarse - grained histories , each with an assigned probability .",
    "a primary goal is the identification of complete sets of coarse - grained histories which exactly satisfy the probability sum rules .",
    "although much has been written concerning this theory , there are only a few calculations on realistic models @xcite .",
    "quantum optics is an avenue where both quantum and classical behaviour are accessible to the experimentalist .",
    "we will in particular look at coarse - grained histories on phase - space itself .",
    "previous calculations have concentrated on position projected histories with momenta information gained through time - of - flight . in this paper",
    "we look for consistent histories in _ both _ position and momentum .",
    "we also note that the interpretation of the diagonal decoherence functional is typically a relative state interpretation and thus the interpretational problems concerning which history is realized are moot ( however see @xcite ) .",
    "we begin by looking at the optical master equation for a system linearly coupled via the usual quantum optical coupling to a bath of harmonic oscillators @xcite . for completeness and to relate this to earlier work let us first consider a system with a hamiltonian @xmath5 in the quantum optical regime we can write the master equation for the reduced density matrix of the system as @xcite @xmath6+\\lambda\\rho={\\cal l}\\rho\\;\\ ; , \\label{eq1.1}\\ ] ] @xmath7 + [ a\\rho , a^{\\dagger } ] \\right\\ } + \\frac{\\gamma\\bar{n}}{2}\\left\\{[a^{\\dagger } , \\rho a ] + [ a^{\\dagger}\\rho , a ] \\right\\}\\;\\;.\\label{eq1.2}\\ ] ] this may be converted into a partial differential equation for a quasi - distribution function ( qdf ) , @xmath8 ( or @xmath9 for short ) where @xcite @xmath10 @xmath11\\;\\;,\\label{eq3}\\ ] ] @xmath12 where we have the normalization @xmath13 .",

    "what follows we will not make much use of equations ( [ eq24 ] ) and ( [ eq24a ] ) except to note that they become diagonal as @xmath78 .",

    "we now wish to examine the behaviour of the off - diagonal elements of @xmath32 in a number of different bases and to determine whether eis occurs .",
    "there have been a number of proposals for the measure of the degree of diagonality of the density matrix @xcite .",
    "these have mostly been defined however for a gaussian @xmath32 . here",
    "we expand these definitions to a measure @xmath80 of the `` diagonality '' of a general density matrix in a particular basis @xmath81 ( @xmath81 here denotes a general basis i.e. x , p , n or coherent state ) .    from recent work @xcite",
    "there appears to exist some competition between the attainment of a stable predictable pointer basis and the attainment of eis type decoherence . in this paradigm",
    "one must be careful not to confuse the loss of coherence with the loss of interference . in this paper",
    "we interpret eis as a process whereby the _ coherence _ of the state is lost . from zurek s earlier work",
    "the signature of decoherence was the vanishing of the _ coefficients _ of the off - diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix of the system in a given basis .",
    "the decay of the interference in a particular basis was due to the decay of these coefficients .",
    "however , the loss of interference can also be brought about by sending the overlap of the off - diagonal states in that basis to zero .",
    "for example , in young s slits , when one sets the slit separation to be very large in comparison to the screen distance , the magnitude of the interference terms decays due to the vanishing of the overlap of these off - diagonal elements in the position basis .",
    "( there may , of course , be significant overlap in other bases , eg . the momentum basis . ) in this case the loss of interference is _ not _ due to the decay of the coefficients associated with these off - diagonal elements .",
    "the state remains pure , no coherences have been destroyed yet the quasi - probability distribution function _ tends _ towards ( but is never exactly ) that displayed by a true probability distribution .",
    "recently decoherence in the eis paradigm has been defined as the absence of interference fringes in the wigner function in the special case of a superposition of two gaussians @xcite .",
    "these interference fringes decay in magnitude for large separations of the two gaussians .",
    "they never disappear except in the case of infinite separation .",
    "the fringes also vanish dynamically with time if one introduces a coupling with an infinite bath . in the latter case coherence",
    "has been lost and the off - diagonal coefficients decay while in the former case the interference terms vanish because the overlap of the off - diagonal elements in the chosen basis goes to zero .",
    "thus , while the loss of coherence necessitates the loss of interference the loss of interference need not result in a loss of coherence . in this paper",
    "we follow the spirit of earlier work and define environment induced superselection as the dynamical process whereby the reduced state of the system deviates from a single ray in hilbert space and moves towards a description as an improper mixture ( for more information on improper mixtures see @xcite ) .",
    "the most obvious measure of the deviation of a given state @xmath32 from being a ray in hilbert space is the statistical distance between the state @xmath32 and the closest mixed state @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the bures metric on the state space of all pure and impure states @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq25 ] ) is very difficult to evaluate in general .",
    "instead we will generalize a measure of coherence for gaussian @xmath32 first introduced by morikawa @xcite and used later in @xcite .",
    "for @xmath32 of the form @xmath84\\;\\;,\\ ] ] morikawa defined a measure of coherence to be @xmath85 when @xmath86 the magnitude of the elements of the density matrix in the position basis are peaked preferentially along the diagonal @xmath87 . for @xmath32 pure , @xmath88 .",
    "the natural generalization of this measure to non - gaussian @xmath32 is to compute the ratio of the off - diagonal variance to the on - diagonal variance of the squared magnitude of @xmath32 in a specified basis @xmath89 , that is @xmath90 for @xmath32 gaussian and @xmath91 , @xmath92 from ( [ eq26 ] ) .",
    "for pure states , @xmath93 and @xmath94 . this makes sense as no pure state undergoing unitary evolution can lose it s coherence .",
    "the offset in the denominator gives the variance of @xmath95 about the mean @xmath96 .",
    "distributions of @xmath97 which are concentrated along @xmath98 result in @xmath99 .",
    "as @xmath100 becomes more concentrated along @xmath101 , @xmath102 decreases to zero . from ( [ eq27 ] )",
    "the value of @xmath102 depends on the basis chosen .",
    "this we expect as some basis will display a greater peaking about their diagonal than others .",
    "the advantage of the dimensionless measure ( [ eq27 ] ) is that one can compare @xmath102 and @xmath103 for various bases @xmath104 .",
    "one can also consider bases which are discrete . in this case",
    "the integrals in ( [ eq27 ] ) become discrete sums .",
    "heuristically the measure @xmath102 tells us how damped the off - diagonal coherences are in the basis @xmath104 . for pure states ,",
    "no matter what the configuration , these `` off - diagonal '' coherences never vanish . for every contribution to the `` on - diagonal '' elements of @xmath32",
    "there are equal contributions to the `` off - diagonal '' elements .",
    "a classic example of this is the superposition of two localized coherent states @xmath105 . for a pictorial description of @xmath97 for this state see zurek @xcite . in this example",
    "the heights of the four peaks in zurek s plots do not change with increasing @xmath106 .",
    "no coherence is lost , however the interference diminishes .",
    "a quantification of the amount of interference present in a state is generally given by the magnitude of a typical off - diagonal element .",
    "for the special case of two superposed gaussians a measure of the fringe visibility of the ripples of the wigner function has been proposed @xcite .",
    "another quantification of the degree of `` off - diagonality '' would be @xmath107 along the off - diagonal . because this measure has dimensions of @xmath108 , comparisons of @xmath109 between bases are made complicated through the different length scales associated with each basis . for a comparison between bases one should use the dimensionless measure ( [ eq27 ] ) .",
    "we also note that while the discrete version of ( [ eq35 ] ) vanishes for @xmath110diagonal ( eg .",
    "spin 1/2 particle ) , for @xmath111 the continuous version of ( [ eq35 ] ) evaluated in the coherent state basis increases like @xmath106 .",
    "although ( [ eq27 ] ) and ( [ eq35 ] ) seem to be natural candidates for a measure of `` diagonality '' in the eis sense we see that the prototypical state ( [ state ] ) is not diagonal nor even approximately diagonal in the coherent state basis . it may be said that since the ripples in the wigner function decrease in size as @xmath112 one should treat this state in this limit as `` interferenceless '' or `` classical '' , this i believe is incorrect . the wigner function for this state always possesses negative regions for all @xmath113 .",
    "the interference represented by these would be manifested in the expectation values of observables which have support in these regions .",
    "the effects of eis are to cause these negative regions to disappear in a finite time . however , as pointed out by bell , positivity of the wigner function is a necessary but _ not _ sufficient condition that the wigner distribution correctly represents a true probability distribution @xcite .",
    "this connection will be made clearer in @xcite .",
    "finally we can use the relation @xmath114 to rewrite ( [ eq35 ] ) as @xmath115 \\right\\}\\;\\;,\\label{eq30a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have used @xmath116    in what follows we will use @xmath102 , ( [ eq27 ] ) as a measure of diagonality . taking @xmath77",
    "we can compute @xmath117 recalling that @xmath50 , ( [ eq14 ] ) , this result would indicate that we obtain a greater degree of diagonalisation in the @xmath61 and @xmath62 basis than in the coherent state basis @xmath81 . at @xmath33 , since the system begins in a pure state , @xmath118 for all bases .",

    "the of the mixture @xmath138 decreases inversely as @xmath139 .",
    "thus packets which are separated in position by amounts significantly greater than their half widths possess lower @xmath61-coherence .",

    "since the glauber states are overcomplete there is some overlap between the two .",
    "as time progresses , the state , represented loosely as two superposed gaussians in the wigner distribution , spirals in towards the origin while the half widths of each gaussian spreads with time for nonzero @xmath147 .",
    "the system motion complicates the interpretation and instead , one can return to the interaction picture .",
    "in the interaction picture , for a fixed choice of @xmath148 where @xmath149 , @xmath143 decreases below the value @xmath150 due to the large separation in position between the two gaussians . however , as @xmath78 , @xmath151 and thus the coherence of @xmath152 tends to the same value as the coherence of @xmath153 in this limit .",

    "the resulting decoherence functional was exponential in form and peaked on the classical path of the damped oscillator . using the measures of dowker and halliwell the degree of consistency and the degree of peaking about the classical path",
    "were calculated and the short and long time limits found .",
    "the behaviour of these quantities were mostly as expected : the consistency gets better with time , increasing bath temperature and final grain size while the peaking is better with increased final and initial grain size and small bath temperature .",
    "the consistency _ decreased _ with increased initial grain size .",
    "we also calculated @xmath204 , a measure similar to the one proposed in the eis section of this paper , which quantifies the amount of coherence in the decoherence functional when the decoherence functional is considered as a density matrix on the space of coarse grained histories .",
    "this measure displayed similar behaviour to the measure of consistency as advanced by dowker and halliwell .",

    "altering the coupling strength @xmath180 , changes only the time derivatives of the degree of eis or consistency achieved and not their actual values .",

    "a special type of graining might be understandable within the arguments given by dowker and halliwell concerning the constructive interference of the constituent histories in a very special coarse - graining .",
    "since the behaviour is seen in three different calculations with two different models @xcite one suspects that there is some feature common to all that is upsetting the expected behaviour of increased consistency with increased @xmath255 .",
    "an approximation common to all of these calculations is the use of `` quasi - projectors '' .",
    "it may be that the non - exclusivity of these projectors is somehow overcounting the contributions of `` off - diagonal '' histories in the decoherence functional .",
    "it is thus necessary to resort to true projectors . since there",
    "do not exist true projectors on phase - space one must consider true projectors on to other spaces . an obvious choice is either the position , momentum or number basis .",
    "choosing the latter is the most computationally efficient and was treated in @xcite .",
    "the results were very surprising and highlighted the differences between the two paradigms , eis and ch .",
    "essentially the goal of eis is the damping of the coherences present in the system s quantum state .",
    "the goal of ch , however , is the attainment of histories whose probabilities satisfy the sum rule . for this to occur",
    "the quantum _ interferences _ between the individual histories must vanish .",
    "the damping of quantum coherence and vanishing of quantum interferences need not be synonymous .",
    "the decay of coherence necessitates the vanishing of interference but not visa versa .",
    "this is clearly shown in the double slit examples of gell - mann and hartle .",
    "when the slit separation is much greater than the slit / screen separation the resulting coarse - grained histories are very consistent . however , if the separate beams are then later on recombined somehow , they will display interference .",
    "one then says that the histories which include this recombination are no longer consistent .",
    "thus , histories which may begin very consistent , may , later on , become very inconsistent and visa versa .",
    "this is so , even though the evolution can be strictly unitary ! from the viewpoint of eis , the coherence of the state is not lost under unitary evolution and thus eis does not occur .",
    "however , if one now inserts the young s slits in a bath of electrons @xcite , the resulting histories are even more consistent and furthermore they can not usually be made less consistent through recombination etc .",
    "this is so because the reduced state of the light beams has lost some of it s coherence to the bath of electrons .",
    "thus , both ch and eis has occurred in the reduced state of the light beams . since the measure @xmath155 was introduced in section iii as a measure of coherence , its value as a measure of consistency ( which involves the vanishing of interferences ) is slightly suspect .",
    "however , we would argue that the vanishing of interference between _ all _ pairs of possible histories in a set of very many alternatives necessitates the vanishing of interference between neighboring histories .",
    "for this to happen , as in the young slit case for small slit separation , one must have a loss of coherence ( usually by introducing a bath ) .    finally , it would be of greater interest to have a more information theoretic formulation of the concept of `` diagonalisation '' and consistency .",
    "the introduction of a bath causes the reduced quantum state to lose it s non - local correlations preferentially in certain bases . to link this concept with that of a pointer basis - that basis least effected through the bath interaction",
    "- would be of interest . also to see how the decohered state ( either via eis or ch ) satisfies the bell inequalities would give , perhaps , a more physical measure of what `` diagonality '' really means .",
    "this work is in progress @xcite . also , the quantification of classical correlations via information theory in the ch approach is also important @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we have shown that in this relatively simple model of a quantum open system eis and ch seem to behave similarly , becoming better with increasing bath temperature and time .",
