    "experimental data on the @xmath1 and @xmath3 dependence of @xmath0-meson production from the cern sps @xcite exhibit tantalizing evidence for @xmath0 suppression when compared to hard qcd production .",
    "do the @xmath0 data in pb+pb - collisions indicate the creation of a deconfined phase of strongly interacting matter , _",
    "i.e. _ a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite ?",
    "such qgp scenarios generally rely on the experimental observation of deviations from the predictions of models of hadronic suppression",
    ". simple analytical models of @xmath0 suppression have used nuclear absorption alone @xcite or absorption by nucleons and comoving secondaries @xcite to fit all but the pb+pb data .",
    "these models generally assume a single , fixed nucleon absorption cross section for all charmonium states and that the comover interaction rate , assuming a bjorken scaling expansion , is essentially thermal .",
    "( for theoretical reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "charmonium final state interactions with mesons and baryons are simulated using the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics , urqmd @xcite , a microscopic hadronic transport model .",
    "the charmonium nucleon cross sections employed here are calculated in a nonrelativistic potential model @xcite since at sps energies , charmonium - nucleon interactions are predominantly nonperturbative .",
    "the charmonium precursors are not eigenstates of the qcd hamiltonian , therefore their effective sizes and interaction cross sections may vary from their production to the final state formation @xcite . thus the charmonium absorption cross sections are assumed to expand linearly with time until their asymptotic value is reached . since the produced particles in the collision have a non - thermal distribution @xcite , comover interactions can rather effectively dissociate the @xmath0 . because of abundant high mass resonances ,",
    "most of the meson induced @xmath0 dissociation processes are exothermic @xcite .",
    "they account for an important fraction of the observed suppression , larger in pb+pb collisions than the nuclear absorption alone .",
    "we apply perturbative qcd to the production of charmonium states by simulating nucleus - nucleus collisions in the impulse approximation .",
    "the nuclear dependence of parton distribution functions is neglected .",
    "the resulting space - time distribution of charmonium production points is inserted into the evolving hadronic environment calculated with urqmd @xcite since the rare quarkonium production processes are small perturbations on the heavy ion collision .",
    "our model is thus designed to account for partonic and hadronic aspects of the charmonium dynamics .",
    "the space - time distributions of hard and soft processes , _",
    "i.e. _ in particular charmonium production and absorption , may overlap .",
    "thus , in our model , a charmonium state produced in a hard process can be dissociated by the interaction with a comoving hadron before this state leaves the nuclear environment and before all other hard production processes are completed ( in contrast to ref .",
    "the probability for such an event , however , is reduced due to the initially small absorption cross sections and the finite formation times of comoving mesons according to the string model ( see below ) . to avoid",
    "double counting , interactions of @xmath4 states with produced hadrons in individual @xmath5 collisions are excluded . in @xmath1 collisions",
    ", all hard @xmath5 collisions can contribute to the @xmath6 production while all soft @xmath5 collisions can contribute to the hadronic environment in which the @xmath4 state may be dissociated .",
    "the error imposed by this concept  inherent to all microscopic and analytical models of comover absorption  is estimated to be very small .",
    "the charmonium states are distributed according to their assumed production probability times their decay probability to @xmath0 s .",
    "thus 40% of the final states are @xmath7 s , 55% are @xmath0 s , and 5% are @xmath8s @xcite . according to the spin degeneracy , 1/3 of the @xmath7 s are @xmath9 states and 2/3 are @xmath10 states .",
    "their momenta are assigned according to the parametrization @xcite , @xmath11    the rescattering cross sections for @xmath12 , assuming @xmath13 , are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath14  mb , @xmath15  mb , @xmath16  mb , and @xmath17  mb .",
    "charmonium - meson cross sections ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , _ etc .",
    "_ ) are reduced by a factor of 2/3 from the corresponding baryon values .",
    "all baryon and meson collisions above the respective dissociation thresholds are assumed to break up the charmonium state .",
    "universal and energy independent cross sections are employed , ignoring any charmonium - meson resonances , perhaps too crude an assumption . from phase space arguments",
    "one can infer that the @xmath0 dissociation cross sections with @xmath20 s should be suppressed close to threshold while it should be enhanced for exothermic channels .",
    "however , we have found that , during the initial stage of the @xmath0 comover collisions , the average interaction energy , @xmath21  gev , is far above threshold @xcite .",
    "there are no calculations of @xmath0 dissociation cross sections with mesons other than @xmath20 s and @xmath22 s @xcite . in a thermal comover scenario the density of heavier mesons is suppressed by the boltzmann factor . according to the urqmd simulations , however , these mesons dominate the comover absorption @xcite . in a forthcoming paper",
    "@xcite the influence of the energy dependence of the comover interactions will be studied further .",
    "the cross sections correspond to the geometrical transverse radii @xmath23 of the charmonium states .",
    "we use @xmath24 to estimate the respective formation times @xmath25 of the charmonium states by choosing @xmath26 . during these formation times",
    "the cross sections increase linearly with @xmath27 @xcite , starting from 0 at @xmath28 .    here",
    "it is important that we also take into account the formation time of comoving mesons ( on average , @xmath29 fm / c ) .",
    "particles produced by string fragmentation are not allowed to interact with other hadrons  in particular with a charmonium state  within their formation time .",
    "however , leading hadrons are allowed to interact with a reduced cross section even within their formation time .",
    "the reduction factor is 1/2 for mesons which contain a leading constituent quark from an incident nucleon and 2/3 for baryons which contain a leading diquark .    for this study",
    ", we have slightly modified the angular distributions of meson - baryon interaction in the urqmd  1.0 model since their strong forward peak underpredicts the total produced transverse energy @xcite .",
    "the model now reproduces the @xmath3 spectra in s(200  gev)+au and pb(160  gev)+pb collisions measured by na35 and na49 , respectively @xcite . neither the amount of baryon stopping nor the rapidity distribution of negatively charged particles which have been shown to agree with experimental @xmath30 and @xmath1 interactions @xcite are significantly affected by this modification .",
    "figure  [ hardet ] shows the calculated number of drell - yan muon pairs , proportional to the number of hard collisions , in pb+pb collisions as a function of the produced neutral transverse energy within @xmath31 .",
    "the na50 data @xcite have been included with the abscissa rescaled to reflect the latest change in data @xcite which indicates an @xmath32  % shift in the absolute @xmath3 scale from previous publications @xcite .",
    "we are aware that the new analysis does not imply a simple overall rescaling of the old data points .",
    "however , in order to reasonably compare the gross features of the experimental dimuon @xmath3 spectrum with our model calculation , we have multiplied all @xmath3-values of the data by 0.8 .",
    "this factor was obtained by comparing the @xmath33 contour from quark matter 97 @xcite and the moriond 98 @xcite proceedings .",
    "the agreement between the model and the rescaled data is to be expected since the na49 @xmath3 distribution @xcite is described correctly @xcite @xcite although the calculated @xmath3 spectrum of the similar s+au system agrees well with the na35 data @xcite .",
    "the urqmd calculation thus indicates an inconsistency between the @xmath3 measurements by na35 , na49 and na50 on the one hand and na38 on the other @xcite . ] . the additional simulation is a simple and well understood model of hard scattering processes in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "figure  [ sigab ] shows the @xmath0 production cross section according to urqmd calculations for several projectile - target combinations ( @xmath34(450  gev)+c , @xmath34(200  gev)+cu , @xmath34(200  gev)+w , @xmath34(200  gev)+u , s(200  gev)+u , and pb(160  gev)+pb ) in comparison to experimental data @xcite .",
    "the results of the calculations are normalized to the experimental cross section in @xmath34(200  gev)+@xmath34 interactions .",
    "the 450  gev and 160  gev simulations are rescaled to @xmath35  gev with the parametrization of ref .",
    "@xcite , as done by na50 @xcite .",
    "considering only nuclear dissociation results in a far smaller @xmath0 suppression than seen in the data , not only for pb+pb collisions but also for s+u and even @xmath36 reactions .",
    "note that the systematics of nuclear absorption shown in fig .",
    "[ sigab ] does not reflect a universal straight line as in glauber calculations with constant absorption cross sections . by taking the nonequilibrium charmonium - meson interactions into account , good agreement with the data",
    "is obtained .",
    "however , a strong dependence on parameters such as the charmonium and comover formation times and the dissociation cross sections remains to be studied in detail @xcite .    due to the linear expansion of the charmonium cross sections with time ,",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath8 cross sections are similar in the very early stages , leading to a weak @xmath37-dependence of the @xmath38 ratio in @xmath36 collisions at central rapidities , apparently consistent with the data . however , for a deeper understanding of this ratio quantum interference effects @xcite as well as refeeding processes , @xmath39 @xcite , must be considered .",

    "figure  [ psidyet ] shows the @xmath0 to drell - yan ratio as a function of @xmath3 for pb+pb interactions at 160  gev compared to the na50 data @xcite .",
    "the normalization of @xmath40 in @xmath30 interactions at 200  gev has been fit to s+u data within a geometrical model @xcite .",
    "the application of this value to our analysis is not arbitrary : the model of ref .",
    "@xcite renders the identical @xmath3-integrated @xmath0 survival probability , @xmath41 , as the urqmd calculation for this system .",
    "an additional factor of 1.25 @xcite has been applied to the pb+pb calculation in order to account for the lower energy , 160 gev , since the @xmath0 and drell - yan cross sections have different energy and isospin dependencies .",
    "the gross features of the @xmath3 dependence of the @xmath0 to drell - yan ratio are reasonably well described by the model calculation .",
    "no discontinuities in the shape of the ratio as a function of @xmath3 are predicted by the simulation .",
    "we have examined charmonium production and absorption processes in @xmath36 and @xmath1 collisions at sps energies .",
    "the microscopic simulation of hard processes in the impulse approximation and the hadronic transport description of @xmath1 collisions with the urqmd model simultaneously provide reasonable @xmath3 dependencies of the drell - yan rates as well as baryon and meson rapidity distributions .",
    "we have modelled @xmath0 absorption according to the scenario described in ref .",
    "cross sections evolving from color transparent small configurations to asymptotic states derived from quantum diffusion and the dynamical @xmath7 polarization ( color filtering ) are taken into account .",
    "the calculated @xmath0 production cross sections for minimum bias @xmath36 , s+u and pb+pb collisions agree with experiment .",
    "dissociation by nonequilibrium comovers accounts for about half of the total absorption in s+u and pb+pb reactions .",
