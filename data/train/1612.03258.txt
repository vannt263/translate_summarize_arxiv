    "last one decade there have been an increasing interest in rich behaviour of these systems which are far from equilibrium @xcite .",
    "one of the key feature of these flocks , is that the systems show a transition from disordered state to a long ranged ordered state with the variation of system parameters : like density , noise strength etc .",
    "@xcite . nature of such transition is a matter of debate even after many years of introduction of a minimal model by t. vicsek _",

    "hence nature of transition is a matter of curiosity in polar flock .    in our present study",
    "we ask a _ question _",
    ", what causes the nature of transition to change from discontinuous type to continuous one ?",
    "in previous studies of metric as well as topological distance models , particles interact with the same interaction strength within an interaction metric or topological distance . but in many biological systems particles have tendency to interact more with their closest neighbours . in recent study of @xcite using maximum entropy principle",
    ", they find the functional dependence of the interaction on the distance which decays exponentially over a range of few individuals .    in our model",
    "we introduce a distance dependent interaction parameter @xmath0 , such that interaction decays with distance within a small metric distance . for @xmath2 , interaction is of vicsek s type and as we decrease @xmath0 strength of interaction decays faster with distance . for all non - zero interaction parameter @xmath5 system shows a disordered state at small density , high noise strength and long - ranged ordered state at high density low noise strength .",
    "we also find another phase transition from phase separated to nonphase separated state as we decrease @xmath0 .",
    "order - disorder transition is first order for phase separated state and gradually becomes continuous as we approach nonphase separated state . + in rest of the article , in section [ model ] we introduce the microscopic rule based model for distance dependent interaction in the vicsek s model and then write the phenomenological hydrodynamic equations of motion for a collection of polar self - propelled particles .",

    "we study a collection of polar self - propelled particles on a two - dimensional substrate .",
    "these particles interact through a short range alignment interaction which decays with distance inside a small interaction radius .",
    "we first describe a rule based distance dependent model for such system , which is similar to model introduced by vicsek s but with an additional distance dependent interaction .",

    "one for the position , that takes care of its self - propulsion and other for orientation , that cares about the interaction between particles .",
    "self - propulsion , is introduced as a motion towards its orientation direction with some fixed step size .",
    "hence position update of particles , @xmath9 + and orientation update with a distance dependent short range alignment interaction @xmath10 + where sum is over all particles inside the interaction radius with @xmath11 , @xmath12 is number of particle within unit interaction radius and @xmath13 is the normalisation factor , which makes @xmath14 again a unit vector , @xmath15 is the strength of noise , which we vary between zero to @xmath16 and @xmath17 is a random unit vector .",

    "<S> hence density phase separation plays an important role in predicting the nature of order - disorder transition . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the two - point density structure factor using coarse - grained hydrodynamic equations of motion with an introduction of a density dependent alignment term in the equation introduced by toner and tu @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> density structure factor shows a divergence at a critical wave - vector @xmath4 , which decreases with decreasing density dependent alignment term . </S>",
    "<S> alignment term in the coarse - grained equation plays the same role as the distance dependent parameter @xmath0 in the microscopic simulation . </S>",
    "<S> our results can be tested in many biological systems : where particle have tendency to interact strongly with their closest neighbours . </S>"
