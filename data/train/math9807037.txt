    "this is a short note whose modest purpose is to introduce a new operad , which we call the swiss - cheese operad .",
    "it mixes naturally the little disks and the little intervals operads , which are j. peter may s @xcite modifications of the little cubes operad , the remarkable discovery of j. michael boardman and rainer m. vogt @xcite .",
    "the swiss - cheese operad is related to the configuration spaces of points on the upper half - plane and points on the real line , considered by maxim kontsevich @xcite for the sake of deformation quantization , in the same way that the little disks operad is related to the configuration spaces of points on the complex plane .",
    "the swiss - cheese operad may also be regarded as a finite - dimensional model of the moduli space of genus - zero riemann surfaces appearing in the open - closed string theory studied recently by barton zwiebach @xcite .",
    "our main theorem describes algebras over the homology of the swiss - cheese operad .",
    "such algebraic structure is expected to be found on the physical state space of open - closed string theory .",
    "i would like to thank takashi kimura and jim stasheff for illuminating discussions .",
    "it would be fair to say that this paper is an offspring of my collaboration with them .",
    "neither has this paper avoided stasheff s famous `` red - ink pen '' , which has miraculously turned into an `` electronic red - ink pen '' at the verge of this millennium .",
    "i am also very grateful to martin markl for his valuable remarks on modules over an operad .",
    "we will be using the standard terminology of operad theory , see @xcite .",
    "operads will be considered in different tensor categories , such as those of manifolds , topological spaces , ( graded ) vector spaces , complexes of vector spaces , sets , and even modules over a given operad , depending on the context .",
    "the swiss - cheese operad resembles the famous little disks operad .",
    "however the pictures for the swiss - cheese operad look more like swiss cheese than those for the little disks operad .",
    "the _ little disks operad _ is a collection of manifolds @xmath0 , @xmath1 , where each @xmath0 is the configuration space of @xmath2 nonoverlapping little disks inside the standard unit disk on the plane :    the space @xmath0 is obviously an open set in @xmath3 ( whence a manifold structure ) , each configuration being uniquely determined by the position of the centers of the disks and their radii .",
    "it is assumed that each little disk is labeled by a number from 1 through @xmath2 , which defines the action of the permutation group @xmath4 on @xmath0 .",
    "the operad composition @xmath5 is given by scaling down given configurations in @xmath6 , ",
    ", @xmath7 , gluing them into the @xmath8 holes in a given configuration in @xmath9 , and erasing the seams .",
    "thus @xmath10 becomes an operad of manifolds .",
    "the _ swiss - cheese operad _ is a collection of manifolds @xmath11 @xmath12 , @xmath1 , where @xmath11 is the configuration space of nonoverlapping disks labeled 1 through @xmath13 and upper semidisks labeled 1 through @xmath2 inside the standard unit upper semidisk , so that the little semidisks are all centered about the diameter of the big semidisk :    = 1.5 in    @xmath11 is an open subset in @xmath14 .",
    "there is a natural action of the group @xmath15 on @xmath11 and two types of composition : @xmath16 the first one is gluing the big semidisks of given configurations in @xmath17 , @xmath18 , into the @xmath19 little semidisks of a given configuration in @xmath20 , the second is gluing the big disks of given configurations in @xmath21 , @xmath22 , into the @xmath8 little disks of a given configuration in @xmath20 .",
    "this looks like a new operad - type structure on first sight , but it is nothing but an _ operad over an operad _ or a _ relative operad _ , all meaning an _ operad of modules over a given operad_.",
    "the point is that the collection of all @xmath23 , @xmath1 , is an operad of modules over the little disks operad @xmath24 , each @xmath25 being a module over @xmath24 .",
    "recall ( @xcite ) that a ( _ right _ ) _ module over an operad _",
    "@xmath26 is a collection of spaces @xmath27 , @xmath12 , on which the action of @xmath28 is given , as well as maps @xmath29 satisfying virtually the same axioms as those of an operad .",
    "modules over an operad form a tensor category with respect to the following tensor product : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the set of all @xmath32-equivariant maps",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath34 acting on @xmath35 by left translation .",
    "the tensor product structure is necessary to speak of operads of @xmath26-modules .",
    "another example of a relative operad comes from linear algebra .",
    "let @xmath36 , @xmath37 be two vector spaces .",
    "the _ endomorphism operad of the vector space _",
    "@xmath36 is the operad @xmath38 , the permutation groups acting by permuting the inputs of multilinear operators and the operad compositions given by substitution of the outputs into the inputs .",
    "the relative version of the endomorphism operad is the _ relative endomorphism operad _ @xmath39 .",
    "it is obviously an operad of modules over the operad @xmath40 .",
    "that said , it is easy to define an algebra over a relative operad : it is analogous to the notion of a group representation .",
    "let @xmath41 be an operad over an operad @xmath26 .",
    "algebra over the relative operad _",
    "@xmath41 is a pair of vector spaces @xmath36 and @xmath37 and two mappings @xmath42 the former being a morphism of operads , which also makes @xmath43 an @xmath26-module , the latter being a morphism of relative operads over @xmath26 .",
    "another class of examples of relative operads may be obtained in the following way .",
    "let @xmath44 and @xmath45 be two operads such that @xmath44 is an _ operad with commutative multiplication _ , cf.@xcite , which is nothing but a morphism @xmath46 from the commutative operad @xmath47 to @xmath44 .",
    "a commutative multiplication can equivalently be given by an element @xmath48 stable under the action of the symmetric group @xmath49 and such that @xmath50 .",
    "( here if @xmath44 is not an operad of abelian groups , the vanishing of the difference must be understood as the equality of the two terms in it ) .",
    "we will also assume that the commutative operad has a _ multiplication unit _ 1 , _",
    "i.e_. , @xmath51 is a point .",
    "therefore , @xmath52 will contain a distinguished element as well .",
    "then the collection @xmath53 for @xmath1 is an operad over @xmath44 , the multiplication in @xmath44 being used to define a product @xmath54 needed for defining the operad composition @xmath55 for @xmath41 .",
    "the associativity of the multiplication guarantees the associativity of the operad composition @xmath55 , and the commutativity implies the equivariance of @xmath55 with respect to the action of the symmetric group .",
    "[ product ] an algebra over the @xmath44-operad @xmath56 defined above may be equivalently described as a pair @xmath57 , such that @xmath36 is an algebra over @xmath44 , and @xmath37 is an algebra over @xmath45 , with an action @xmath58 defining on @xmath37 an @xmath45-algebra structure over the commutative associative algebra @xmath36 , where @xmath36 acquires the structure a commutative associative algebra with a unit because of the morphism @xmath46 .",
    "an @xmath45-algebra structure on @xmath37 over a commutative algebra @xmath36 means that @xmath59 ( where @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 denoting the commutative product in @xmath36 , and @xmath63 the action of @xmath36 on @xmath37 ) is independent of a possible arrangement of parentheses , and @xmath64 for any @xmath65 .",
    "given an algebra @xmath66 over the @xmath44-operad @xmath67 , we immediately have an @xmath44-algebra structure , which induces a commutative algebra structure via @xmath46 , on @xmath36 and an @xmath45-algebra structure on @xmath37 .",
    "take the operad units @xmath68 and @xmath69 and form their cross - product @xmath70 .",
    "the algebra structure over the relative operad @xmath41 will then create a linear map corresponding to @xmath71 .",
    "the operad unit axiom for @xmath44 and @xmath45 implies that the composite map @xmath72 evaluated at @xmath73 is the identity map .",
    "if we track the same composition for the relative endomorphism operad , we will see that the operation @xmath74 corresponding to @xmath75 is nothing but @xmath76    to show that an expression is independent of an arrangement of parentheses , it suffices to show that @xmath77 this follows from the fact that the following operad compositions are equal : @xmath78 ( { \\operatorname{id } } , { \\operatorname{id } } ) ) \\linebreak[1 ] = \\gamma ( ( { \\operatorname{id } } , { \\operatorname{id } } ) ; m)$ ] , by definition of @xmath55 for the product relative operad @xmath79 .",
    "the relation is satisfied for the similar reason : the operad composition @xmath80 is defined by using the commutative multiplication @xmath2 times : @xmath81 .",
    "suppose now we have an @xmath44-algebra @xmath36 , which in particular means @xmath36 is a commutative associative algebra with a unit , and an @xmath45-algebra @xmath37 over the commutative algebra @xmath36 , as defined in the statement of this proposition .",
    "we have to show that these data define a module @xmath66 over the relative operad @xmath79 .",
    "define the corresponding morphism @xmath82 by . what remains to see",
    "is that this is indeed a morphism of relative operads .",
    "the symmetric group equivariance follows from that for the structure operad morphisms @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the compatibility with the actions of @xmath44 on @xmath85 and @xmath43 follows from the fact that @xmath83 is a morphism of operads .",
    "the compatibility with the operad compositions @xmath55 for @xmath85 and @xmath43 follows from the fact that @xmath84 is a morphism of operads and the linearity .",
    "different operads are in general responsible for different algebraic structures .",
    "the little disks operad defines the important class of _ gerstenhaber or g - algebras _ , which are defined by two operations , a ( dot ) product @xmath86 and a bracket @xmath87 $ ] , on a graded vector space @xmath88 , so that the product defines a graded commutative algebra structure on @xmath88 and the bracket a graded lie algebra structure on @xmath89 $ ] , the desuspension of the graded vector space @xmath90 : @xmath89^n = v^{n+1}$ ] .",

    "the way the little disks operad @xmath24 has relevance to g - algebras is through its homology operad @xmath95 and the following theorem .",
    "[ cohen ] the structure of a g - algebra on a @xmath96-graded vector space is equivalent to the structure of an algebra over the homology little disks operad @xmath95 .    here",
    "we must take into account the @xmath97 component of the little disks operad and a unit in a g - algebra .",
    "this is an obvious extension of cohen s theorem .    what is the analogue of this theorem for the swiss - cheese operad ?",
    "an algebra over the homology swiss - cheese operad @xmath98 is a pair of graded vector spaces @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath36 endowed with the structure of a g - algebra with a unit and @xmath37 with the structure of a graded associative algebra over @xmath36 , regarded as a graded commutative algebra with respect to its dot product .",
    "a _ swiss - cheese algebra _ is a pair @xmath66 of vector spaces with the structure described in the theorem .",
    "an algebra over a relative operad consists of a pair of graded vector spaces @xmath36 and @xmath37 . by cohen s theorem [ cohen ]",
    ", @xmath36 is a g - algebra .",
    "each @xmath24-module @xmath25 , @xmath1 , is homotopy equivalent to @xmath99 as a @xmath24-module .",
    "moreover the whole collection @xmath100 is homotopy equivalent to the collection @xmath101 as a @xmath24-operad in the homotopy category of topological spaces  one just has to choose an arbitrary point in @xmath102 as a multiplication , which will be associative and commutative up to homotopy , and provide the collection of the symmetric groups @xmath4 s with the natural operad structure .",
    "this operad structure makes @xmath103 into the associative operad @xmath104 , whose algebras are nothing but ( graded ) associative ones . passing to homology",
    ", we get exactly the situation of proposition  [ product ] : @xmath66 is an algebra over the product operad @xmath105 , except that we are now in the category of graded vector spaces , so that all operads and algebras will be graded .",
    "the proposition then describes this algebra structure as required by this theorem .",
    "in this section we will outline a geometric construction of what we will call the homotopy swiss - cheese operad , similar to kontsevich s construction @xcite of the @xmath106-operad .",
    "we will not provide complete details whenever the material is a straightforward generalization of the proofs and constructions of @xcite .",
    "we will first construct a relative operad homotopy equivalent to the swiss - cheese operad .",
    "this new operad will have a filtration compatible with the relative operad structure and therefore give rise to an operad of spectral sequences converging to its homology operad .",
    "the spectral sequences will collapse at @xmath107 , making @xmath108 an operad of complexes whose homology is the homology swiss - cheese operad .",
    "it will be this operad @xmath108 that we will call the homotopy swiss - cheese operad .",
    "consider the configuration space @xmath109 of @xmath12 labeled distinct points on the upper half - plane and @xmath110 labeled distinct points on the real line on the complex plane , assuming @xmath111 . also consider the quotient configuration space @xmath112 , where @xmath113 .",
    "the spaces @xmath109 and @xmath114 are homotopy equivalent to the component @xmath11 of the swiss - cheese operad . unlike the spaces @xmath11 , the configuration spaces @xmath109 or @xmath114 do not form a relative operad .",
    "we will compactify the spaces @xmath114 _  la _ kontsevich @xcite , and more generally fulton - macpherson @xcite , to become smooth manifolds with corners and form a relative operad , homotopy equivalent to the swiss - cheese operad , to which we add the component @xmath115 and",
    "from which throw away the component @xmath116 to satisfy the stability condition @xmath117 .",
    "the compactification @xmath118 will be formed pointwise by stable configurations .",
    "a _ stable configuration _ is a semistable complex algebraic curve @xmath119 of genus zero with @xmath120 smooth labeled punctures , @xmath121 , @xmath117 , and a special @xmath122st smooth puncture labeled @xmath123 , along with the following data :    1 .   the choice of a line through @xmath123 along with the choice of orientation on the line , which allows us to identify the corresponding irreducible component @xmath124 of @xmath119 with the complex plane up to a transformation in the group @xmath125 .",
    "no punctures or double points are allowed strictly below this line on the component @xmath124 .",
    "2 .   the choice of oriented lines passing through selected double points on selected irreducible components ( not more than one line on each component ) .",
    "no punctures or double points are allowed strictly below each of these lines on the corresponding irreducible components .",
    "if a double point lies on such a line on one irreducible component , a real line must pass through this double point on the adjacent component .",
    "the choice of a real tangent direction at the point @xmath123 and to each irreducible component at each double point not lying on a real line .    on each irreducible component @xmath126 , one can count the number @xmath127 of punctures and double points not lying on the real line ( if any ) and the number @xmath128 of punctures and double points on the real line ( if any ) .",
    "the stability condition means by definition that , for each component with no real line , @xmath129 and , for each component with a real line , @xmath130 . each component is considered up to the group of its conformal transformations : @xmath125 for components with the choice of a real line and the group @xmath131 for components with no lines .",
    "naively , one can think of a stable configuration as a semistable complex algebraic curve which is cut into two pieces by a cross section through a straight line passing through @xmath123 and a number of double points on different components , with one of the two pieces completely forgotten ( discarded ) and tangent directions chosen at each double point not lying on the cross section .    as a set , the _ compactification _ @xmath118",
    "may be defined as the set of stable configurations .",
    "the structure of a smooth manifold with corners may be obtained by translating the point - set description into a sequence of real blowups of the space of configurations where not all points must be distinct .",
    "the compactification we have described here is exactly the same as the one constructed by kontsevich in @xcite , which he used to prove his formality conjecture ; we are just giving a new interpretation of points of that compactification .",
    "the simpler similar compactifications @xmath132 in which no real lines are involved form an operad homotopy equivalent to the little disks operad .",
    "the components @xmath133 form an operad isomorphic ( as an operad of manifolds with corners ) to the stasheff polyhedra operad , which is homotopy equivalent to the associative operad @xmath104 . the whole collection @xmath118 makes up a relative operad over the operad @xmath132 .",
    "the two relative operad compositions @xmath55 and @xmath134 are given by joining stable configurations at punctures to form new double points .",
    "the obtained relative operad is homotopy equivalent to the swiss - cheese operad .",
    "let us filter the spaces @xmath118 by the number of double points : @xmath135 where @xmath136 consists of stable configurations that have at least @xmath137 double points , @xmath138 .",
    "the operad compositions @xmath55 and @xmath134 respect the filtration , because they create double points .",
    "for each space @xmath118 , we get a spectral sequence .",
    "these spectral sequences form an operad of spectral sequences , see @xcite , here a relative one , with the @xmath139 terms forming a relative operad of complexes .",
    "the operad of complexes @xmath108 , by analogy with the corresponding constructions for @xmath133 and @xmath132 , may be called the _ homotopy swiss - cheese operad_. however , it is not known whether the spectral sequence collapses at @xmath107 and the homotopy swiss - cheese operad is indeed a free resolution of the swiss - cheese operad .",
    "a _ homotopy swiss - cheese algebra _ may be defined as an algebra over the homotopy swiss - cheese operad .",
    "a homotopy swiss - cheese algebra comprises a certain algebraic structure on a pair of complexes @xmath36 and @xmath37 of vector spaces , which includes operations similar to those of a swiss - cheese algebra and a hierarchy of higher homotopies for relations satisfied by those operations in a strict swiss - cheese algebra , relations between the relations , etc . since @xmath37 is an algebra over the operad @xmath133 , it carries the structure of an @xmath106-algebra . since @xmath36 is an algebra over the operad @xmath132 , it carries the structure of a homotopy g - algebra , in a sense which is different from the several versions introduced in @xcite and used in @xcite and @xcite - algebra is not accurate ; the construction that justifies the definition contains an error , which was pointed out to me by d.  tamarkin . ] .",
    "the zeroth row of the term @xmath108 for the operad @xmath132 is nothing but the @xmath140-operad .",
    "the last row is nothing but the @xmath141-operad ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the only ( @xmath142 ) row in @xmath108 for @xmath133 is the @xmath106-operad .",
    "thus the homotopy swiss - cheese algebra structure establishes an interplay between these three homotopy algebraic structures .",
    "a similar compactification was used by zwiebach in his work @xcite on open - closed string theory .",
