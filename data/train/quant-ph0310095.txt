    "this last term leads to a fast cancellation of the off  diagonal elements of the system reduced density matrix , which is studied by averaging ( i.e. , tracing ) the full  system density matrix over the environment degrees of freedom .    in general , the visibility of an experimental diffraction pattern can be considered the result of combining incoherence and decoherence . in this paper",

    "studies on neutron interferometry can be accurately carried out by means of classical optics @xcite provided that energy is low and spin effects are negligible . since classical optics only accounts for incoherence effects , this approach is of great help in our case in order to discern whether or not decoherence effects are relevant .",
    "this analysis will also provide the physical conditions that the quantum model for the possible decoherence must fulfill .",
    "therefore , we first analyze here the optics of the neutron beam to establish the relevance of incoherence effects in the diffraction pattern .",

    "@xcite , in the theoretical description of the experiment we will take into account the pass of the neutron beam through @xmath11 , @xmath4 , and @xmath15 . if @xmath11 is identified with a neutron source that can be assumed as incoherent @xcite , i.e. , the intensity at each point along the aperture does not depend on any other point , then @xmath30 here , @xmath31 is the average intensity at @xmath32 .",
    "when no absorption takes place at the borders of @xmath11 ( i.e. , each point of the aperture produces the same intensity ) and @xmath29 is independent on the position along this aperture , @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 with @xmath35 describing the spectral profile of the neutron beam . it should be emphasized that to keep the explicit dependence on @xmath29 is important , since the source is not totally monochromatic .",

    "the first minima of this correlation pattern @xcite take place at @xmath43  @xmath8 m .",
    "therefore , the spatial width illuminated by its central maximum will be relatively larger than the extension covered by the double  slit arrangement .",
    "this means that the two diffracted beams will display a slight divergence , a fact that must be included as a source of incoherence in the quantum model ( see sec .  [ sec4 ] ) .",
    "the double  slit acts as a modulator of the incoming wave with a modulation function @xmath44 .",
    "thus , the power spectrum at @xmath4 can be written as @xmath45 after crossing the double  slit the two diffracted beams described by @xmath46 propagate freely until reaching @xmath15 . there , the power spectrum , @xmath47 , is computed by replacing , in eq .",

    "[ fig:1 ] . however , the value of the fringe visibility , @xmath59 , is still far from the experimental value .",
    "moreover , the amplitude of the oscillations is constant , in strong disagreement with the experimental pattern .    if the finite size of @xmath15 is taken into account , the measured intensity for a position @xmath32 of the detector results @xmath60 which decreases the fringe visibility , but leaves the profile of the interference pattern unaffected .",
    "the non  monochromaticity of the neutron beam leads to a subsequent integration over the spectral bandwidth .",
    "taking into account the optical relation @xmath61 , this integral can be carried out easily by assuming @xmath62 , and substituting the corresponding quantities by @xmath63 and @xmath64   .",
    "thus , in the particular case of a uniform spectral profile over the bandwidth @xmath65 , one obtains @xmath66      \\cos(k\\bar{d}x / v ) ,   \\label{eq:13}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the approximation of constant sinc  functions ( with @xmath67 ) has been used , since these functions vary slowly within the integration interval ( about a 4% with respect to their value at @xmath68 ) .",
    "the results obtained with this expression are much better than those for eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) but still far from the experimental data .",
    "in particular a value of @xmath69 is obtained , and the averaging process introduces a certain modulation with respect to the constant  amplitude intensity of eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) . however , the decay in the intensity pattern as the absolute value of the detector position increases is not satisfactory .",
    "this is a general feature [ i.e. , independent of the spectral profile determined by @xmath35 ] coming from the assumption of point slits at @xmath4 .",
    "the modulation of the intensity pattern is a border effect caused by the finite size of the slits , while the oscillations are the result of the interference of two spatially separated wavefronts .",
    "this can be easily shown by considering that the slits are coherently illuminated ( i.e. , the modulation function is described by the sum of two hat functions ) , and their size is relatively small @xcite . in this way",
    ", one can assume that eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) still holds , and introduces the sinc  function caused by a finite  size slit into it , thus obtaining @xmath71      s(\\lambda ) .",

    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "as can be seen , the intensity pattern fits much better the experimental results , presenting only a small discrepancy for the central minima .",
    "however , the fringe visibility , @xmath75 , does not still fully account for the value obtained experimentally , although it improves with respect to the previous cases .",
    "therefore , the most important conclusion derived from this phenomenological analysis of the experiment is that , although different causes contribute to the incoherence of the neutron beam , they are not sufficient to explain the experimental results . the remaining contribution should then be attributed to dynamical causes , i.e. , decoherence , which will be analyzed in the next section .",
    "one final consideration is worth mentioning .",
    "the finite size of the slits is an important factor to take into account in the formulation of the quantum model .",
    "indeed , a general phenomenological form for the measured intensity accounting for the loss of coherence can be postulated from eq .",
    "( [ eq:15 ] ) as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the intensity function produced by the slit @xmath78 ( with @xmath79 ) , @xmath80 the intensity function modulating the interference , @xmath81 the coherence degree or damping coefficient , and the cos ",
    "function is the term purely due to the interference between the two slits .",
    "notice that coherence degree and fringe visibility are not the same unless both partial waves contribute equally to the intensity , as happens in eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) , where @xmath82 .",
    "optical models are attractive because of their their simplicity ( and accuracy when used in association with fitting procedures ) .",
    "however , they do not deal with the loss of coherence due to dynamical processes , such as those taking place in the regions where the neutron beam evolves freely .",
    "the effect produced by such processes is what we call decoherence . in general , decoherence is understood as a complex effect concerning the phase of a many  body wave function @xcite .",
    "for example , according to the model proposed by caldeira and leggett @xcite , decoherence arises from the interaction of the system with a bath of harmonic oscillators linearly coupled to the system .",
    "the collisions between particles belonging to the system and the environment constitute another mechanism proposed to explain the loss of coherence @xcite in physical processes . although these scattering events may be individually quite inefficient , when taking place in large numbers they may lead to an exponential damping of the off ",
    "diagonal elements of the system reduced density matrix , since @xmath83 where @xmath84 , @xmath85 is the collision rate , and the scattering process between states @xmath86 and @xmath87 is described by the corresponding @xmath88matrix element .",
    "according to the physical considerations made in the previous section , in our quantum  mechanical description of the process",
    "we only consider the evolution of the neutron beam from @xmath4 to @xmath15 , assuming that both outgoing partial waves at @xmath4 are coherent ( i.e. , finite  size slits ) .",
    "moreover , as mentioned above , these partial waves differ in width ( because of the different slit sizes ) , and then move apart separating along the two opposite directions ( notice , however , that the component of this motion is relatively small ) .",
    "these initial conditions are the responsible for incoherence . taking this into account , the evolution of the neutron beam after passing through @xmath4 ( and without being affected by an external environment )",
    "can be described at any subsequent time @xcite as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the partial wave emerging from slit @xmath78 , and @xmath91 at any time . in the coordinates representation",

    "the diagonal terms of ( [ eq:19 ] ) give the probability density or measured intensity @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the time ",
    "dependent phase difference between both partial waves .",
    "when the action of an environment is considered , the wave function ( [ eq:18 ] ) does no longer describe the evolution of the full system . since our main interest focuses on the question of how the environment affects the coherence of the system by gradually suppressing the ( non  classical ) oscillatory term in eq .",
    "( [ eq:20 ] ) , we will assume conditions of elastic scattering @xcite .",
    "accordingly , only the states describing the environment change during the scattering process , while the system states remain unchanged .",
    "in particular , in our case both partial waves will propagate as free gaussian wave packets since they are gaussians initially ( see below ) . in this way",
    ", the initial coherent state @xmath96 becomes an entangled state with the form @xmath97 at any subsequent time .",

    "( [ eq:16 ] ) .",
    "now , we make the ( reasonable ) assumption that the environment states are too complex to keep mutual coherence as time increases @xcite . in this way , even if they are initially coherent , they become orthogonal as time passes .",
    "thus , one can assume @xmath120 , being @xmath121 the coherence time , a measure of how fast the system becomes classical ( smaller @xmath121 implies faster loss of coherence ) .",
