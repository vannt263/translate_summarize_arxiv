    "the nature of dark matter ( dm ) still represents a mystery that physicists try to unveil since more than 80 years from its first evidence in the coma galaxy cluster by fritz zwicky .",
    "a lot of interesting schemes have been provided in order to allocate dm candidates with very different masses , from about @xmath0 up to @xmath1  gev .",
    "the most promising scenario is the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) paradigm , in which the interaction between the standard model ( sm ) and the dm is of the order of the weak interactions and the dm particle can have a mass from @xmath2  gev up to @xmath3  tev due to the unitary constraint @xcite .",
    "however , the missing evidence of a dm particle in all direct searches ( dm production at colliders as lhc and sm  dm scattering ) suggests that the only viable way to obtain information about very massive dm candidates would exploit indirect searches in astrophysical observations .    the icecube ( ic ) neutrino observatory @xcite represents a good experiment to observe high energy phenomena where massive dm particles produce neutrinos with very high energy .",
    "after three years of data - taking ( 2010 - 2013 ) ic experiment has collected 37 neutrino events with deposited energy from 30  tev up to 2  pev .",
    "since the compatibility with the expected atmospheric background ( muons and neutrinos produced by the decay of @xmath4 and @xmath5 and prompt neutrinos coming from the decay of charmed mesons ) is excluded at 5.7  @xmath6 , the origin of such events has to be related to some extraterrestrial processes .    in the paper @xcite",
    "we have analyzed the possibility that the pev neutrinos are produced by leptophilic three - body decays of dm particles .",
    "contrary to previous scenarios @xcite , we assume that the ic neutrino spectrum can be explained by the sum of three different components :    * the _ atmospheric _ component , which dominates for energies up to 60  tev ; * a bottom - up component ( hereafter denoted as _ astrophysical neutrino flux _ ) from know astrophysical sources in the 60 - 300  tev energy range ; * a top - down additional component ( hereafter denoted as _ dm neutrino flux _ ) for higher energy",
    ".    therefore , the total neutrino flux for @xmath7  tev is equal to @xmath8 the number of neutrino events for a given energy bin @xmath9 $ ] can be obtained by the relation @xmath10 where @xmath11  days is the exposure time and @xmath12 is the neutrino effective area for different neutrino flavour @xmath13 @xcite . due to the low statistics at our disposal ,",
    "we have considered for simplicity the equivalence between deposited and neutrino energy .",
    "such an approximation does not affect dramatically our qualitative results @xcite .",
    "there exist many astrophysical sources that are potentially able to produce high energy neutrinos through the acceleration of protons , which then interact with themselves ( @xmath14 interactions ) or with photons ( @xmath15 interactions ) .",
    "the most popular astrophysical sources proposed for icecube are the extragalactic supernova remnants ( snr ) @xcite , the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite and the gamma ray bursts ( grb ) @xcite .",
    "all these bottom - up scenarios are affected by large uncertainties since there is not a complete knowledge about the physics of the proton acceleration mechanism . moreover",
    ", each astrophysical source is not able to fit alone all the ic observations .",
    "for instance , extragalactic snr has a cut - off in energy of the order of 100  tev , whereas agn provides a good description of ic neutrino flux at high energy only .    in the present analysis , in order to cover all the acceleration mechanisms related to different astrophysical sources , we parametrize the astrophysical component of the total neutrino flux either with a unbroken power law ( upl ) @xmath16 or with a broken power law ( bpl ) , characterized by an exponential cut - off at some energy scale @xmath17 @xmath18 in the previous expressions , the quantity @xmath19 is the spectral index while @xmath20 is the normalization of the flux . as suggested by the extragalactic snr results @xcite , we fix the value of the cut - off @xmath17 to be equal to 125  tev .",
    "in our analysis we study the case of a heavy fermionic singlet dm candidate @xmath21 , which decays into sm particles through a coupling having few characteristics .",
    "in particular , we require that    * the dm particle is directly coupled to neutrinos via a leptophilic coupling .",
    "indeed any coupling to other sm particles ( higgs , gauge bosons and quarks ) would unavoidably lead to an abundant production of secondary neutrinos , ruling out any astrophysical component ; * the coupling is non - renormalizable in order to suppress the lifetime of @xmath21 with powers of the energy scale of new physics .",
    "this improves the need of an unnatural tiny coupling that in general has to be @xmath22 ; * the dm particle decays into a multi - body final state . in this way , the dm neutrino flux is not peaked at a given energy but is spread to lower energy .",
    "the first operator that satisfies all the previous requirements is the _ non - renormalizable lepton portal _",
    "@xmath23 where @xmath24 is the lepton left - handed doublet , @xmath25 is the right - handed lepton and @xmath26 are flavour indices .",
    "we assume that the energy scale of new physics is the planck mass @xmath27 . in order to forbid the other operators as @xmath28",
    ", we invoke a global flavour symmetry as @xmath29 , for which with a suitable choice of the charges we have @xmath30 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details about this model and the other case of non - abelian groups ) .",
    "assuming for simplicity that @xmath31 , the lifetime of the dm particle @xmath21 , having a mass @xmath32 , is equal to @xmath33    in this framework , the top - down component to the neutrino flux consists in a galactic contribution ( g ) and an extragalactic one ( eg ) , whose expressions are given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the navarro - frenk - white density profile of dm particles in our galaxy as a function of distance @xmath36 from the galactic center , @xmath37 is the hubble expansion rate as a function of redshift @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the critical density of the universe . in the analysis",
    ", we consider the @xmath40cdm cosmology where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( from the planck experiment @xcite ) . finally , the quantity @xmath45 is the neutrino energy spectrum coming from the decay of @xmath21 .",
    "it has been evaluated by means of a montecarlo procedure , taking into account the electroweak radiative corrections that in general change the energy spectrum at energies almost two orders of magnitude smaller than the dm mass @xcite .",
    "it is worth observing that our results satisfy the fermi - lat bound on the total electromagnetic energy @xcite .",

    "the icecube neutrino observatory had the first evidence of extraterrestrial high energy neutrinos , which can be related to the presence of new physics .",
    "we have analyzed the scenario where the ic neutrino flux corresponds to the sum of three different contributions : the atmospheric background ( @xmath61  tev ) , an astrophysical component ( 60  tev@xmath62  tev ) and a top - down component ( @xmath63  tev ) that arises from the three - body decay of a leptophilic dm candidate with a mass of 5.0  pev . even though the ic neutrino flux can be explained only by an astrophysical origin due to the low statistics ,",
    "the decaying dm scenario is very intriguing since it can provide important information on dm physics and can give indication on the direction for future dm experiments .",
    "moreover , it is worth observing that such a scenario can be easily tested in the early future .",
    "indeed , it predicts the presence of a sharp cut - off above few pev and an anisotropy towards the galactic center because the dm neutrino flux consists in a galactic contribution ( almost 2/3 of the total flux ) and an extragalactic one .    even if our results regard only the ic three years data , the decaying dm scenario is still in agreement with the new ic data of four years @xcite . a new track event with a deposited energy of about 2.6  pev has been observed , but the energy of the primary neutrino is unknown because such an event is not fully contained in the ic detector . however , if the neutrino energy was of the order of few pev , this would not change our scenario once the dm mass is slightly shifted to high energy .",
