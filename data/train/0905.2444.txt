    "consider a system of electrically charged massive scalars and massive fermions of the opposite charge at high densities .",
    "when the interparticle separation is small , or the temperature of the system is high , neutral fermion - boson bound states will be unable to form . at high temperatures",
    "the equilibrium state of the system is a plasma . as the system cools below a certain critical temperature",
    ", the energy of the coulomb interactions will significantly exceed the thermal energy , and the ionized system can crystallize . however , in certain cases the de broglie wavelengths of the scalars begin to overlap before the crystallization temperature is reached . in this case , instead of crystallizing , the quantum - mechanical probabilistic `` attraction '' of the bosons can force the scalars to undergo condensation into a zero - momentum macroscopic state of large occupation number .",
    "the scalars minimize their kinetic energy , while phonons can not be thermally excited since the phonon mass gap  produced by this condensate  happens to be greater than the corresponding temperature .",
    "therefore , after the phase transition all the thermal energy is stored in the near - the - fermi - surface gapless excitations of quasi - fermions .",
    "we refer to this state as a charged condensate @xcite .",
    "this condensation mechanism is different from that of the abelian higgs model , or equivalently , the relativistic ginzburg - landau theory of superconductivity  the scalar field in our case has a conventional positive - sign mass term .",
    "a nonzero expectation value for the electric potential @xmath2 , or a nonzero chemical potential for the scalars , plays the role of the tachyonic mass , enabling the scalar field to acquire a vacuum expectation value @xcite .",
    "the condensation mechanism is generic : the electromagnetic interaction can easily be generalized to any @xmath3 abelian interaction , and the scalar field could be a fundamental field or a composite state .    in this work",
    "we argue that the charged condensate has properties somewhat similar to type ii superconductors .",
    "in particular , we show that it can admit solutions that are similar to the abrikosov vortices @xcite , originally found in the ginzburg - landau model of superconductivity , and later recovered in the relativistic abelian higgs model in @xcite .",
    "the vortex solution is a topologically stable configuration , characterized by a nonzero winding number of the phase of the complex scalar field .",
    "asymptotically , the scalar field is given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the vacuum expectation value of the field and @xmath6 is the azimuthal coordinate .",
    "like the abrikosov vortex , the charged condensate vortex carries a quantized magnetic flux .",
    "the vortex solution has a higher energy density than the pure condensate solution .",
    "however , in the presence of a sufficiently high external magnetic field , it becomes energetically favorable for the charged condensate to form vortices .",
    "the obtained vortex line solution exhibits the following structure : it has a narrow cylindrical core where the scalar field changes significantly from a nonzero to a zero value ; this core is surrounded by a broad halo in which the magnetic flux is confined .",
    "the width of the latter region is determined by the penetration depth ( i.e. , the photon compton wavelength ) .",
    "we refer to the system of the core and the halo as the flux - tube , or the vortex line .",
    "this structure is similar to that of the abrikosov solution .",
    "however , unlike the latter , our solution also carries a profile of the electrostatic potential within the halo , while this potential is exponentially small outside of the halo ( i.e. , the flux tube is charge neutral ) .",
    "hence , in terms of differential equations , one has to solve three coupled equations instead of the two required in the abrikosov @xcite , or nielsen - olesen cases @xcite .",
    "one application of the charged condensate is to helium - core white dwarf stars .",
    "the cores of these dwarfs are composed of a highly dense system of helium-4 nuclei and electrons . at high temperatures ,",
    "the electrons and nuclei form a plasma .",
    "while white dwarf stars composed of carbon , oxygen or heavier elements are expected to crystallize as they cool @xcite , it was argued in refs .",
    "@xcite that the helium-4 nuclei would instead form the charged condensate , as the condensation temperature in the helium dwarfs is higher than the temperature at which the system would crystallize .",
    "this transition dramatically affects the cooling history of the helium - core white dwarfs .",
    "in fact , they cool faster ; as a result , the luminosity function exhibits a sharp drop - off below the condensation temperature @xcite .",
    "such a termination in the luminosity function may have already been observed in a sequence of the 24 helium - core white dwarf candidates seen in ngc 6397 @xcite .",
    "the above conclusions were obtained by considering white dwarfs that are not magnetized .",
    "magnetized helium - core dwarf stars are also believed to exist ; in magnetized white dwarf stars , surface magnetic fields have been detected ranging from @xmath7 to @xmath1 gauss .",
    "if this is the case , it is important to know how the presence of a magnetic field would affect the above - described properties of the charged condensate .    in analogy with type ii superconductors",
    ", we would expect an external magnetic field to be entirely expelled from the charged condensate below a certain critical value of the field @xmath8 . above this value , however , we d expect to have a mixed phase in which the magnetic field penetrates the charged condensate only in the form of the abrikosov - like vortices .",
    "finally , above a certain @xmath9 the magnetic field should entirely destroy the charged condensate .",
    "indeed , this is the pattern that we find in the present work .",
    "the corresponding values of the critical magnetic fields in the interior of helium - core white dwarfs are : @xmath10 gauss , and @xmath11 gauss , while in between these two scales we find quantized magnetic vortices permeating the bulk of helium - core dwarf stars .",
    "hence in most of the magnetized helium white dwarfs the magnetic field will be expelled from the core in which the charged condensation has taken place .",
    "it s only the highly magnetized dwarfs , with fields @xmath12 gauss , that can admit vortices . also , since the value of @xmath13 gauss is much higher that any magnetic field that may be present in dwarf stars , there will be no disruption of the charged condensate due to magnetic fields .",
    "the presence of the magnetic field would decrease the critical temperature at which the charged condensation would take place .",
    "however , this decrease will be significant only for the fields @xmath14 close to the critical ones . for smaller fields ,",
    "the change in the value of the critical temperature will be small @xmath15 .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we briefly describe the condensation mechanism for a generic system of scalars and fermions in the context of relativistic field theory . in section 3",
    "we fix the phase of the scalar field to be of the vortex - type and solve the corresponding equations of motion .",
    "we compare our solutions to those found in the abelian higgs model .",
    "in section 4 we consider corrections to our solutions due to the dynamics of the fermions . in section 5",
    "we consider the effects of an external magnetic field on the charged condensate and determine the magnitude of the external field for which it becomes energetically favorable to form vortices . in section 6",
    "we treat specifically the case of helium-4 nuclei and electrons .",
    "we describe the system in the context of a non - relativistic low energy effective field theory , rather than the relativistic field theory used in the previous sections .",
    "we discuss the applicability of the vortex solutions found in section 4 to the helium-4 nuclei and electron system .",
    "we also consider the effect of a constant rotation on the condensate of helium-4 nuclei .",
    "we start by considering a generic , highly dense system of charged , massive scalars and oppositely charged fermions .",
    "we assign a charge of @xmath16 to the scalars and @xmath17 to the fermions in anticipation of the helium-4 nuclei and electron system to be discussed later in section 6 .",
    "however , for now we keep our considerations general .",
    "the scalar field considered below could be any fundamental scalar field , possibly originating in beyond - the - standard - model physics .",
    "our conclusions are independent of the specific charge assignment .    the scalar condensate is described by the order parameter @xmath18 .",
    "a nonzero vacuum expectation value of @xmath18 implies that the scalars are in the condensate phase .",
    "here we adopt a relativistic lorentz - invariant lagrangian which contains the charged scalar field @xmath18 , and the photon field @xmath19 .",
    "the fermion current is given by @xmath20 .",
    "[ lagr0 ] = - f_^2 + d _ ^2 - m_h^2 ^ -e a^ j _ .",
    "the covariant derivative for the scalars is defined as @xmath21 .",
    "the above lagrangian could also contain a quartic interaction @xmath22 . in the case",
    "that @xmath23 , this term will not alter significantly our results .",
    "other possible terms including a yukawa interaction between fermions and scalars were considered in ref .",
    "for now we treat the fermions as a fixed , constant background charge density @xmath24 .",
    "we will relax this assumption in section 4 and consider effects due to the dynamics of the fermions and quantum loops of relativistic fermions . for simplicity",
    "we take the system to be at zero temperature ( for some discussions of finite temperature effects see , @xcite ) .",
    "because the system has a conserved scalar current , we can associate with it a chemical potential @xmath25 .",
    "for the hamiltonian density , the inclusion of a chemical potential for the scalars results in the shift @xmath26 , where @xmath27 $ ] is the time component of the conserved scalar current .",
    "for the lagrangian density this shift can be written as a shift in the covariant derivative @xmath28 . in",
    "what follows primed variables @xmath29 , @xmath30 will refer to those variables which include a nonzero chemical potential for the scalars .",
    "the complex order parameter @xmath18 can be written in terms of a modulus and a phase @xmath31 . in these variables",
    "the lagrangian density becomes [ lagr ] =- f_^2 + ( _ ) ^2 + ( 2ea_+_s _ 0-_)^2 ^2- m_h^2 ^2 - e a^ j _ . from this form of the lagrangian",
    "it is evident that a nonzero expectation value for @xmath32 or a nonzero chemical potential @xmath25 act as a tachyonic mass for the scalars @xcite .",
    "in particular , when @xmath33 , the scalar field condenses , as we shall now show .",
    "varying the lagrangian with respect to @xmath19 and @xmath34 gives the following equations of motion : [ eom1 ] -^f _ & = & 2e(2ea_+_s _ 0- _ ) ^2-ej _ , + [ eom2 ] & = & [ ( 2ea_+_s _ 0-_)^2-m_h^2 ] .",
    "varying with respect to @xmath35 gives the conservation of the scalar current : [ j0scalar ] ^j_^scalar = ^= 0 .",
    "on equation of motion ( [ eom1 ] ) this expression is automatically satisfied .",
    "we now work in the unitary gauge where the phase of the scalar field is set to zero : @xmath36 .",
    "note that this gauge choice is acceptable for a classical description of the condensate , however , in subsequent sections we will not be able to choose this gauge for the vortex solution for a well - known reason : in order to take @xmath37 to @xmath38 , the corresponding gauge transformation @xmath39 would be singular at the origin where the vortex core is located .    in the unitary gauge the equations of motion ( [ eom1 ] ) , ( [ eom2 ] ) have the following static solution with a nonzero expectation value for @xmath34 : [ staticsol ] 2 e a_0 + _",
    "s= m_h ,  = .    in the condensate",
    "the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the photon acquires a mass [ mgamma ] m_= 2e .",
    "this mechanism of symmetry breaking differs from the abelian higgs model in that here the scalar field has a conventional positive - sign mass term . a nonzero expectation value for @xmath32 or a nonzero chemical potential @xmath25 act as a tachyonic mass term .",
    "if we consider a system with no net charge then @xmath40 .",
    "then , from expression ( [ staticsol ] ) , in order for the scalar field to condense the chemical potential must satisfy @xmath41 .",
    "the bulk of the condensate is always electrically neutral , the scalar charge density exactly canceling the fermion charge density : @xmath42 .",
    "to find the charged condensate solution ( [ staticsol ] ) , we fixed the phase of the scalar field to zero .",
    "we now consider a configuration where the phase is not set to zero , nor can it be set to zero everywhere by a non - singular gauge transformation .",
    "the requirement that the scalar field be single - valued everywhere is satisfied by demanding that the change in phase around a closed loop be an integer multiple of @xmath43 . in a system with cylindrical symmetry",
    ", this is satisfied by setting @xmath44 , where @xmath6 is the azimuthal coordinate and @xmath45 is an integer .",
    "this phase can be removed everywhere by a gauge transformation @xmath46 , except at the origin where the scalar vev goes to zero and the gauge transformation would be singular .",
    "the solutions of the equations of motion ( [ eom1 ] ) , ( [ eom2 ] ) where the phase is fixed to @xmath44 are vortex - type solutions .    hence , @xmath47 at the origin @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 is the 2d radial coordinate ) .",
    "far from the origin however , we expect the solutions to recover the condensate solutions ( [ staticsol ] ) . at large @xmath49",
    "then , the gauge field takes the form @xmath50 , or equivalently @xmath51 . from this form of the vector potential",
    ", it follows that this configuration has a quantized magnetic flux @xmath52 that is related to the integral of @xmath53 around a closed loop at infinity : [ flux ] _ _ = = a_r = .",
    "the magnetic flux is quantized in units of @xmath45 .",
    "the quantization of flux implies the stability of the vortex configuration , although it may be possible for a high @xmath45 vortex to decay into multiple vortices of smaller @xmath45 .    to solve the equations of motion ( [ eom1 ] ) , ( [ eom2 ] ) for the vortex configuration we switch notation to dimensionless variables .",
    "the resulting equations are governed by a single parameter @xmath54 , the ratio of the mass of the scalar to the mass of the photon in the condensate : @xmath55 .",
    "this parameter @xmath54 is the equivalent to the ginzburg - landau parameter in the theory of superconductors which gives the ratio of the penetration depth to the coherence length . for the helium white dwarf star ,",
    "if we take the mass of the helium-4 nuclei to be roughly @xmath56 gev and the electron density to be @xmath57 , then we have @xmath58 . in our derivations below we frequently take the large @xmath54 limit .",
    "we define @xmath59 , set @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and perform the following change of variables : [ changevar ] m_a(x ) & & 2exa_(x ) , + m_f(x ) & & 2e ( x ) , + m_h b(x ) & & _",

    "the equation of motion for the vector potential , expressed via @xmath65 , is the same as in the charged condensate model . in the equation for the scalar field ,",
    "the @xmath66 term in the abelian higgs model gets replaced in the charged condensate model by a term that depends on the electric potential .",
    "in addition , in the charged condensate equations the electric potential is generally not zero and not constant and has its own equation to satisfy .",
    "let us first examine the asymptotic behavior of the solutions to the condensate equations for @xmath67 .",
    "far from the origin we expect the fields to be very close to their condensate values .",
    "then , on the r.h.s . of equation ( [ eoma ] ) , it follows that @xmath68 is very small .",

    "we then substitute these expressions as well as expression ( [ alarge ] ) into the equations for @xmath73 and @xmath74 and keep only terms linear in the perturbations @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "these two equations can be combined to obtain a fourth order differential equation for @xmath78 . using the ansatz @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 are as yet undetermined constants",
    ", we can find the particular and homogeneous solutions for @xmath78 in the large @xmath72 limit .",
    "we also take @xmath84 which we will justify later .",
    "for the particular solution we find [ bp ] b_p(x ) = .",

    "as @xmath54 is large , the second term in the above expressions for @xmath73 and @xmath74 dominates the asymptotic behavior . for @xmath91",
    "we have [ basym ] b(x ) 1 + , + [ fasym ] f(x ) 1 + .",
    "the asymptotic behavior for the vector potential and the scalar field are similar to that for the abelian higgs model : [ afasymhiggs ] a^ah(x ) = 1-c_a ^-x ,   f^ah(x ) = 1 - + c_f .",
    "the vector potential @xmath65 , and thus the magnetic field , are the same in both the charged condensate and abelian higgs models .",

    "this discrepancy was first pointed out by l. perivolaropoulos in @xcite .",
    "the incorrect asymptotic behavior is obtained if one similarly expands @xmath93 as @xmath94 and only keeps terms linear in @xmath95 .",
    "this is because the last term in ( [ eomf ] ) and the last term in ( [ eomfah ] ) are quadratic in @xmath95 and yet , due to the different exponential dependence of the perturbations @xmath95 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , these terms can be dominant over terms which are linear in @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "linearizing @xmath65 gives the correct asymptotic behavior of the fields only in the limit that @xmath54 is small .",
    "the second term in the full expressions for @xmath73 and @xmath74 and thus the asymptotic behavior of both fields is due strictly to the presence of a nonzero magnetic field . in the absence of any magnetic field ,",
    "the screening of any small perturbation of the fields above their condensate values vanishes as @xmath96 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    the above asymptotic expressions are valid as long as @xmath97 , or equivalently @xmath98 .",

    "much larger than @xmath102 we assume that the scalar field @xmath74 is still close to its condensate value .",

    "alternatively , we can once again expand @xmath73 and @xmath74 above their condensate values , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and solve for @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",

    "moreover , @xmath79 becomes of order 1 at @xmath105 and thus the linear approximation in general no longer holds below this scale .    finally , we d like to solve in the @xmath106 limit . before we do so , however , we emphasize that validity of this procedure needs some justification .",
    "the interparticle separation is given by @xmath107 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath108 . at distances shorter than this @xmath72",
    "we expect that an effective field theory would break down and thus it would make little physical sense to solve the equations ( [ eoma ] ) , ( [ eomf ] ) and ( [ eomb ] ) in this regime .",
    "moreover , the scale @xmath102 is typically shorter than the interparticle separation @xmath109 , hence , particles at these scales can not in general be modeled by a smooth distribution .",
    "however , both fermions and bosons are in a condensate state in which the location of individual particles has uncertainties much greater than the interparticle separation .",
    "hence the latter notion loses its meaning as a microscopic characteristic of the system . for this",
    ", we ll still approximate particle distributions by smooth functions all the way down to the scale @xmath110 , which is a dynamically determined short - distance scale at which weakly coupled expansion breaks down @xcite .",
    "as to solving at scales less that @xmath102 , we regard this as a purely mathematical exercise aimed at finding the matching of the asymptotic solutions for the corresponding differential equations for all values of the coordinate @xmath72 .",

    "the number density of fermions in the vortex @xmath117 is constant and is the same as the number density of fermions in the normal condensate phase .",
    "we have fixed it so by hand , but will justify this later .",
    "the scalar number density is given by @xmath118 and varies as a function of @xmath72 .",
    "therefore it is not in general equal to its condensate value @xmath119 .",
    "the variation of the scalar number density away from its condensate value can lead to a net charge density of the vortex core within the vortex halo .",

    "the matching radius should be chosen so that these two effects combine to give the appropriate charge density as determined by gauss s law .    from gauss s law",
    "we can calculate the the average charge density of the vortex inside radius @xmath122 . as is usually the case",
    ", we can determine the net charge enclosed in a region knowing only the form of the potential at the boundary of that region .",
    "equation ( [ bfsol ] ) gives the potential in the intermediate region independent of matching coefficients @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",

    "the negative sign indicates a dearth of scalars in this region , but , as @xmath54 is very large , this is a small correction to the overall average charge density of scalars @xmath125 . to check this result",
    "one can likewise use the asymptotic solution for @xmath73 , expression ( [ btot ] ) , at @xmath122 . assuming that the coefficients @xmath87 and @xmath88 are not exponentially large and thus these terms are not dominant in the solution for @xmath73 at @xmath122 , one finds @xmath126 .",
    "this is consistent with the previous result .",
    "farther out , @xmath127 is exponentially suppressed thus the net charge of the vortex approaches zero as @xmath72 becomes large .",
    "we can now use this result to determine the matching radius @xmath128 . given the smallness of the average charge density found inside @xmath129",
