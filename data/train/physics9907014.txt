    "an atom in a near - resonant light field of frequency @xmath15 experiences both a conservative force ( due to stimulated photon exchange ) and a dissipative force ( due to spontaneous photon emission)@xcite .",
    "the conservative force is the gradient of a spatially - dependent potential @xmath16 which can be viewed as the time - averaged induced dipole interaction energy ( proportional to the real part of the classical polarizability ) in the electric field , or equally well as the ` light shift ' ( that is , energy level shift due to the ac stark effect ) of the atomic ground state @xcite .",
    "we assume that we apply a monochromatic light field of detuning @xmath17 to an alkali atom ( with the @xmath18 transition resonant at @xmath19 ) , in the _ far - detuned _ regime ( @xmath20 greater than the excited state hyperfine splitting , but much less than @xmath19 ) and the _ low saturation _ regime ( @xmath21 , where the rabi flopping rate @xmath22 is defined @xcite by @xmath23 , the dipole matrix element multiplied by the electric field amplitude ) .",
    "the dipole potential has both a scalar and a magnetic part : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the spontaneous decay rate , @xmath26 is the spatially - dependent saturation parameter , and the potential is taken to be much less than the ground state hyperfine splitting .",
    "only the magnetic part is affected by @xmath8 , which is defined as the projection of the total angular momentum @xmath27 on the direction of the local effective magnetic field @xmath28 .",
    "the constant @xmath29 is the nuclear land g - factor appropriate for the @xmath27 of the ground state .",
    "the scalar potential is identical to the case of a two - level atom , apart from the strength factor @xmath30 which is @xmath31 for detuning from the d1 line , @xmath32 for the d2 @xcite .",
    "it is important to be precise with the definition of the saturation parameter .",
    "we write @xmath33 where @xmath34 ( in the mksa system ) is the squared electric field amplitude in a plane wave of intensity @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "this avoids the ambiguities present with the usual definition @xmath36 in the case of a general monochromatic light field ( composed of an arbitrary coherent sum of travelling and evanescent waves ) , and emphasizes that it is the local electric field alone that causes the dipole potential .",
    "the effective magnetic field has a strength and direction given by the circularly polarized component of the electric field@xcite , which can be written thus : @xmath37 \\times \\im[{\\bf e}_0{({\\bf r})}]}{\\es2 } \\,,\\ ] ] where the strength factor @xmath38 is @xmath39 for d1 , @xmath32 for d2 , and we take the physical electric field ( with amplitude @xmath40 ) to be the real part of a complex field @xmath41 .",
    "the reason for the ` dummy ' constant @xmath42 is aesthetic , so that ( [ eq : alkali ] ) can be expressed in a standard magnetic form . note that for nonzero @xmath8 the magnetic and scalar contributions to the potential are of similar order , if the fields have significant circular polarization ( this will be true for our trapping fields , for the reason that the optical guide is close to cut - off ) .    the fact that @xmath16 has its sign controlled by the sign of the detuning allows both attractive ( red - detuned ) and repulsive ( blue - detuned ) potentials to be created .",
    "the potential scales as @xmath43 but the spontaneous emission rate scales as @xmath44 ; from this follows the well - known result that , if coherence time is an important factor , it is best to be far off - resonance and use high intensities in order to achieve the desired trap depth @xcite .    for simplicity ,",
    "in this paper we will restrict our further analysis and simulations to @xmath3 , although our initial calculations suggest that the effect of the magnetic part of our potential when trapping in other @xmath8 states will not pose major problems ( assuming the spin axis adiabatically follows the @xmath28 field direction ) , and can even be used to our advantage by increasing the depth and the transverse oscillation frequency @xmath45 in the case @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "also , we will consider the effect of only a single resonance ( choosing d2 because it has a larger @xmath30 than d1 ) , which is a valid approximation when the detunings from this resonance are much less than the alkali atom fine structure splitting @xmath47 . even when it becomes advantageous to use a large detuning of the order of @xmath47 , it is possible to cancel the effect of the other resonance by a simple shift in the two detunings ( as we will see at the end of section  [ sec : dep ] ) .",
    "if we now have two light fields of differing frequency , the atomic potentials add@xcite , as long as we assume that the timescale of atomic motion is much slower than the beating period ( that is , the inverse of the frequency difference ) . in our case ,",
    "atomic motion occurs at @xmath48hz and our light field frequency difference is @xmath49hz , so this assumption is valid .",
    "choosing equal but opposite detunings @xmath50 about the d2 line , the trapping potential for @xmath3 is @xmath51 \\,,\\ ] ] written in terms of the saturation parameters for the two colors .",
    "the spontaneous scattering rate@xcite is a factor @xmath52 smaller than @xmath53 ( in fact this relation applies for any @xmath8 state ) , but it depends on the _ sum _ of the saturation parameters rather than the _ difference_. it is also spatially dependent , and has the form @xmath54 \\,.\\ ] ]      our basic task is to create intense evanescent light fields with a potential minimum sufficiently far from a dielectric surface to make the surface interaction potential and heating mechanisms negligible ( discussed in section [ sec : surf ] ) .",
    "the main difficulty arises because the evanescent fields have a typical exponential decay length @xmath55 , so if we are to have a trap of useful depth , we are restricted to keep it within roughly @xmath11 of the surface ( less than a micron ) .",
    "a potential minimum in one dimension can be obtained using a blue ( repulsive ) light field of higher intensity at the dielectric surface than the red ( attractive ) light field , and ensuring the decay lengths obey @xmath56 , giving a potential of the form @xmath57 this gives a repulsive force at short range , which becomes attractive at long range ( see figure [ fig : geom]b ) , and is the scheme for the planar trap of ovchinnikov _ et al .  _",
    "a large amount of insight into our proposed trap can be gleaned from this simple one - dimensional model ( which we call the _ exponential approximation _ ) , because the squared electric fields above the guide will turn out to approximate exponential forms in the vertical direction quite closely .    if we define a normalized decay length difference @xmath58 , then we can give two reasons why increasing @xmath59 is a vital design objective .",
    "firstly , it is easy to show that for small @xmath59 the deepest available trap depth ( found by optimizing the ratio of surface intensities @xmath60 ) scales as @xmath59 .",
    "secondly , a larger @xmath59 is beneficial for trap coherence , ( giving a smaller spontaneous decay rate at a given trap depth and detuning ) , because the sum of the intensities can be kept lower ( see equation ( [ eq : spont ] ) ) for a given intensity difference ( equation ( [ eq : pot ] ) ) .",
    "we will quantify this latter connection in section [ sec : dep ] .",
    "our two key differences from the proposal of ovchinnikov _ et al .",
    "_ are as follows .",
    "firstly , we create a non - zero @xmath59 by using two orthogonally - polarized bound modes of a dielectric slab guide , which have different evanescent decay lengths at the same frequency@xcite .",
    "this contrasts with ovchinnikov _",
    "et al .  _ who suggest varying the decay lengths by varying the reflection angles from the inside surface of a glass prism .",
    "secondly , horizontal confinement is achieved by limiting the width of the slab guide to approximately @xmath11 ( forming what is called a _ channel guide _",
    "@xcite ) , which automatically creates a maximum in each light intensity field in the horizontal direction .",
    "this results in a tight horizontal confinement in the atomic potential , of similar size to the vertical confinement , and is something very hard to achieve in a prism geometry .    a schematic of our design",
    "is shown in figure [ fig : geom]a .",
    "the optical guide height @xmath61 and width @xmath62 are kept small enough to guarantee that there are exactly two bound modes , differing in polarization but not in nodal structure ( in optical terminology this is called _ single - mode _ ) : @xmath63 has an electric field predominantly in the x direction@xcite , and is to be excited by blue - detuned laser light , and @xmath64 has electric field predominantly in the y direction and is to be excited by red - detuned laser light .",
    "we can see why their vertical decay lengths differ by considering the case of the slab ( _ i.e. _ taking the width @xmath65 ) , where these modes are simply the slab te and tm modes respectively .",
    "for both these slab modes the purely transverse field obeys the differential equation @xmath66 \\",
    ", \\phi \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) for the te ( tm ) mode , the eigenvalue @xmath69 is the effective refractive index for the @xmath70 mode ( @xmath71 being the wavenumber in the propagation direction and @xmath72 the free space wavenumber ) , and @xmath73 is the spatially - dependent refractive index @xcite .",
    "( this is equivalent to a one - dimensional quantum problem in the direction normal to the slab , in a potential @xmath74 with @xmath75 ) .",
    "however the boundary conditions on the slab surfaces differ for the two mode types : @xmath76 is always continuous , but @xmath77 is continuous for te as opposed to @xmath78 continuous for tm .",
    "this asymmetry exists because the permittivity @xmath79 varies in space but the permeability @xmath1 is assumed to be constant .",
    "this discontinuity in the gradient for the tm mode forces it to have a lower @xmath80 than that of the te mode , which means it is less tightly bound so has a longer evanescent decay length .",
    "this effect becomes more pronounced as the slab index increases or as optical cut - off is approached ( which happens when @xmath80 decreases until it reaches @xmath81 and the mode becomes unbound ) .",
    "this tendency is preserved even as the width is decreased to only a few times the height , as in our scheme .",
    "no analytic solution exists for the general rectangular guide , so we used the finite element method discussed in section [ sec : num ] to solve for the bound mode @xmath80 values and fields as a function of guide dimensions .",
    "figure [ fig : cutoff ] shows the resulting ` cut - off curves ' , that is , contours of constant @xmath80 in the parameter space @xmath82 . in this example we chose a guide index @xmath83 ( typical for a polymer dielectric ) and , as a preliminary case , a substrate index @xmath84 .",
    "the single - mode region , in which we wish to remain , is bounded below by the @xmath85 and @xmath86 curves and above by the @xmath87 curve .",
    "note that , as in any dielectric guiding structure uniform in the z axis , the lowest two modes ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 in our case ) _ never _ truly reach cut - off , rather , they approach it exponentially as the guide cross - section is shrunk to zero . for this reason , we chose the practical definition of cut - off for these modes to be @xmath88 , which corresponds to only about 20% of the power being carried inside the guide .",
    "in contrast , higher modes do have true cut - offs@xcite ( this distinction is illustrated by the dispersion curves of figure [ fig : num ] ) , and for the @xmath87 mode our ( numerically limited ) contour choice of @xmath89 falls very close to the true cut - off curve .    using the numerically calculated electric field strengths of the @xmath85 and @xmath86 modes , we found the red and blue guided laser powers which gave the deepest trap , subject to the constraint of fixed total power ( keeping the detuning constant @xcite ) .",
    "we also imposed the restriction that the zero of trapping potential come no closer than 100 nm along the vertical line @xmath90 , which kept the trap minimum a reasonable distance from the surface ( see section [ sec : surf ] ) . performing",
    "this optimization over a region of the parameter space covering the single - mode region gave a contour plot of maximum achievable depth for a given total power , shown within the rectangle overlayed on figure [ fig : cutoff ] .",
    "this depth increases from negligible values in the top left to the largest depths in the lower right , indicating that choosing @xmath62 and @xmath61 to be in this latter corner of the single - mode region is best for depth .",
    "the depth shows very little variation with @xmath62 in this corner , rather it is clear that varying @xmath61 to stay within our definition of the single - mode region has become the limiting factor on achievable depth .",
    "we indicate a practical choice of @xmath91 and @xmath92 as a small marker on figure [ fig : cutoff ] .",
    "example trapping potentials shapes possible with these parameters are shown in figure [ fig : pot ] ; we discuss their properties in section [ sec : prop ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : geom]a the direct excitation of the optical guide by the two laser beams is shown only schematically . in a realistic experimental setup this coupling into",
    "the guide would happen on the order of a centimeter from the atom guiding region , and could involve tapered or bragg couplers@xcite from beams or from other fibers .",
    "at this distance we estimate that isotropic stray light due to an insertion loss of 0.5 would have 8 orders of magnitude less intensity than the ew fields in the guiding region . assuming the light is coherent , this limits the fractional modulation of the guiding potential to @xmath93 .",
    "more improvements are possible , including the use of absorbing shields , bending the guide through large angles away from the original coupling direction , and reducing the coherence length .      we have shown in figure [ fig : cutoff ] that parameters optimized for trap depth are near optical cut - off .",
    "it is worth gathering together the physical reasons for this .",
    "firstly , on general geometric grounds , the typical available intensities in a guide scale inversely with the effective cross - sectional area of the bound mode , which , far from cut - off ( that is , when @xmath94 ) follows very closely the cross - sectional area of the guide .",
    "this makes it favorable to shrink guiding structures to areas less than a square wavelength , where they generally become single - mode .",
    "secondly , once we re in the single - mode regime , as we approach cut - off the mode power is carried increasingly outside the guide , increasing the ratio of surface intensity to guide center intensity .",
    "thirdly , the evanescent decay length in the vacuum is longer as we approach cut - off ( recall that in the case of the slab , this is exactly expressed by @xmath95 @xcite , where the factor of 2 arises because we are considering intensity decay length rather than amplitude ) . in the special case of @xmath84 ,",
    "the decay length diverges to infinity as we approach cut - off . finally , the ratio @xmath59 becomes larger as we approach cut - off , with corresponding beneficial effects on depth and coherence ( due to increasing the ` goodness factor ' we will introduce in section [ sec : dep ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , these purely theoretical reasons for approaching cut - off are in opposition to more practical ones .",
    "the closer to cut - off a guide is , the more sensitive it is to manufacturing variations in cross - section : in our case this will be predominantly a sensitivity to @xmath61 .",
    "the result is that small variations in @xmath61 cause large variations in mode size , or , at worst , complete cut - off .",
    "if the mode size change is rapid ( nonadiabatic ) along the z axis , ( for instance if this change is due to surface roughness or refractive index inhomogeneities ) the resulting mismatches will be a source of scattering of the guided power . any coherent scattering back down the guide will set up periodic modulations of the light field over long distances .",
    "( one way to reduce the distance over which coherent addition is possible is to use very broad line - width light sources , which would dramatically reduce modulations due to both guided and stray scattered light ) .",
    "the consequence for the atoms would be a z - dependent trap depth and shape , and this could lead to partial reflection or even localization of the matter waves . in general",
    "we expect scattering to limit how close to cut - off we can reliably operate .    with regard to the substrate ,",
    "further practical issues arise . in",
    "the above cut - off calculation we chose the simplest case of @xmath84 , corresponding to a guide surrounded by vacuum . a real substrate with @xmath96",
    "has the unfortunate effect of limiting the propagation constant @xmath71 of strictly bound modes to be larger than the freely propagating wavevector in the substrate ; in other words , @xmath97 must hold or the light field will rapidly tunnel into the ` attractive potential ' of the substrate .",
    "this in turn limits the decay lengths and @xmath59 that can be achieved .",
    "the trap properties quoted in the abstract and in sections [ sec : dep ] and [ sec : other ] paper rely on very low @xmath80 values ( 1.07 for the @xmath85 mode , 1.18 for @xmath86 ) for the reason that a low @xmath80 is the only way to create long evanescent decay lengths in the vacuum .",
    "( this is equivalent to ovchinnikov _ et al .  _ choosing reflection angles very close to critical@xcite . )",
    "however , in section [ sec : sub ] we present preliminary results for a substrate of sodium fluoride ( the lowest - index common optical mineral , at @xmath98 ) , and do not believe the substrate alters the basic feasibility of our waveguide .    for completeness , here we list some other possible approaches to the substrate issue .",
    "1 ) use an aerogel substrate , which can have exceptionally low refractive indices and low loss ( films of several @xmath1 m thickness with indices of about 1.1 can be produced@xcite ) .",
    "2 ) use a dielectric multilayer substrate with an effective index of unity or less ( very low loss multilayer mirrors@xcite with effective indices less than unity can be created ) .",
    "3 ) investigate if there exist guide shapes which have sufficiently small tunnelling rate into a conventional substrate that the fact that the modes are not strictly bound becomes irrelevant ( for instance , a wedge shape with the smallest face in contact with the substrate ) .",
    "4 ) unsupported guiding structures could be produced over short distances@xcite . finally , it is important to note that the idea of replacing the substrate by a metallic reflective layer is not practical because they are too lossy .    ultimately , the best values of @xmath62 and @xmath61 , the best guide cross - sectional shape , and the substrate choice will depend on many of the above factors and is an area for further research .",
    "in the bulk of this section we will examine the atomic waveguide properties for light nearly resonant with the d2 line of cesium , using an optical guide of index 1.56 of the dimensions @xmath91 and @xmath92 from section [ sec : des ] , and a substrate of unity index .",
    "the saturation intensity for cesium is 11.2w / m@xmath99 @xcite , and its resonant wavelength of 852 nm requires that the physical guide size is 0.83@xmath1 m by 0.21@xmath1 m .",
    "( at the end of the section we present preliminary calculations for a @xmath100 substrate and a different guide , and discuss how the atom waveguide properties are changed ) .    given the guide ,",
    "we are free to choose three experimental parameters , namely the optical powers carried in the two modes , and the detuning @xmath20 ( assumed to be symmetric , that is , to be of equal magnitude for red and blue beams , because little advantage can be gained with an unsymmetric detuning ) .",
    "the first two of these can usefully be reexpressed as total power @xmath101 , and the power ratio @xmath102 .",
    "the trap shape will be affected by @xmath103 alone : we show the trapping potential shapes achievable at the two practical extremes of @xmath104 and @xmath105 in figure [ fig : pot ] , where we have chosen @xmath106 and @xmath20 to give identical trap depths and coherence times .",
    "smaller @xmath103 values cause the trap minimum to move further from the surface ( a distinct advantage ) , to be less `` bean '' shaped ( _ i.e. _ to have smaller cubic deviations from a 2d harmonic oscillator ) , and to cause a slight increase in collection area .",
    "it is possible to achieve a trap minimum as distant as @xmath107 from the surface when @xmath105 .",
    "the only disadvantage to implementing these smaller @xmath103 values is that a higher @xmath106 is required to achieve the same trap depth and coherence time ( for instance a factor of 7.5 increase is required as we take @xmath103 from 0.4 to 0.2 ) .",
    "this can be quantified within the exponential approximation , and it can be found that the total power required to maintain a given depth and coherence time with a fixed trap geometry scales as @xmath108 .    if we were purely interested in maximizing trap depth at a given @xmath106 and detuning , it would be best to make @xmath103 as large as possible , however if we take @xmath103 much larger than 0.4 the trap is brought so close that the corners of the `` bean '' shape touch the dielectric surface ( see figure [ fig : pot ] , upper plot ) and we will lose effective collection area due to sticking of atoms onto this surface .",
    "we may ask what trade - offs are necessary between trap depth and coherence time .",
    "it turns out that , within the exponential approximation ( [ eq : uofy ] ) , this is elegantly quantifyable .",
    "we can define a ` goodness factor ' @xmath109 where the trap minimum position @xmath110 is at @xmath111 , and the second equality is verified by substitution of ( [ eq : pot ] ) and ( [ eq : spont ] ) , and defining @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "we use this latter definition because we are interested in the coherence time of atoms spending time close to the trap minimum ( which will certainly be true for the transverse ground state . ) using ( [ eq : uofy ] ) to solve for @xmath114 and evaluate the ` goodness factor ' , it turns out that the factor is independent of either laser power ( _ i.e. _ of either @xmath115 or @xmath116 ) , giving @xmath117 combining ( [ eq : gdef ] ) and ( [ eq : geval ] ) gives @xmath118 fixing the product of achievable depth and coherence time as a constant multiple of the detuning .",
    "this is a remarkable result since it shows that increasing @xmath59 is really _ the _ only objective in the field design of two - color ew traps .",
    "we can write this in units more convenient for cesium trap design , thus , @xmath119 where the value @xmath120 ( taken from best - fit exponentials to the numerically - found squared electric fields for the guide dimensions of section [ sec : des ] with @xmath84 ) has been substituted to give the the final form . this design expression does not give the @xmath106 required to reach a desired balance between @xmath121 and @xmath122 , however , the total laser power is usually in the mw range , several orders of magnitude less than in most free - space trap designs .",
    "for instance , with @xmath123mw , @xmath104 and @xmath124 nm we could generate a trap of 2mk depth with the relatively short coherence time of 0.9ms .",
    "the transverse oscillation frequencies in this trap would be @xmath125khz and @xmath126khz ( the field shapes fix this ratio at about 1:4 ) , giving an atomic mode spacing due to the x motion of 5.6@xmath1k , roughly twice the cesium mot temperature , and a characteristic ground - state size of 26 nm by 12 nm .    for coherent guiding , we can define a more physically meaningful figure of merit , @xmath127 , which tells us the typical number of coherent transverse oscillations we can expect multiplied by @xmath128 ( _ i.e. _ it is the q - factor of the transverse oscillations ) .",
    "we should choose @xmath129 since this is the smaller of the transverse frequencies in our case .",
    "for @xmath130 the transverse atomic modes will be well resolved , and our guide can be a useful interferometric device . using ( [ eq : tradeoff ] ) , in conjunction with the fact that when the trapping potential shape is fixed then @xmath45 is proportional to the square root of the depth , tells us that for a given trap and detuning , @xmath131 . for a higher @xmath132 we should choose smaller transverse oscillation frequencies , that is , shallower traps .",
    "for example , the 2mk trap discussed above has @xmath133 , but if we reduce it to a 20@xmath1k trap of the same @xmath20 ( by changing @xmath103 or the laser powers ) , the @xmath132 is 10 times larger .",
    "increasing @xmath20 would allow even higher @xmath132 to be realized .",
    "the dependence on detuning in ( [ eq : expt ] ) is another way of expressing the advantages already known about using far off - resonant beams@xcite .",
    "however , our single - resonance approximation will break down if the detuning is too large : we have ( somewhat arbitrarily ) chosen a detuning limit of 15 nm , as compared to @xmath134 nm for cesium . at this limit",
    ", the additional dipole potential created due to the detunings from the d1 line is very significant .",
    "however , by removing the detuning symmetry ( changing @xmath135 from + 15 nm to + 12.07 nm and @xmath136 from -15 nm to -17.14 nm ) , the desired d2 single - resonance approximation potential is recovered in the true physical situation of both resonances present .",
    "( these required shifts , which are of order @xmath137 , can easily be found using the expression for the sum of dipole potentials from the two lines . )",
    "an additional necessity for our limit is the fact that any larger detunings start to demand separate bound - mode calculations for the two colors , a treatment we reserve for the future .",
    "this detuning limit in turn limits the depths , coherence times and q - factors we quote here , but we anticipate similar future ew atom waveguide designs which explore the region @xmath138 ( or even @xmath139 ) , and achieve much better coherence .",
    "we estimate the collection area of the trap as the cross - sectional region within which the potential is deeper than the typical cesium mot energy @xmath140 .",
    "for our example 100@xmath1k traps of figure [ fig : pot ] this area is about 1@xmath1m@xmath99 .",
    "however , it is not possible to do much better than this with our design : if one tries to increase the area by increasing the overall trap depth , the @xmath140 contour touches the substrate , indicating that atoms at this energy can reach the substrate surface , where they will stick , limiting the effective collection area .    to investigate the lifetime of atoms transported incoherently ( the multi - mode regime )",
    ", we can calculate the heating rate along similar lines as grimm and weidemller@xcite .",
    "we start with their equation ( 23 ) which gives the rate of change of the average of the total energy of atomic motion @xmath141 as @xmath142 @xmath143 being the recoil temperature , and use the assumption that in an equilibrated 3d trap @xmath144 . since there is harmonic motion in two directions but free motion in the third ,",
    "the virial theorem gives us @xmath145 . combining this with @xmath146 from ( [ eq : gdef ] ) gives the heating rate @xmath147 which is of the order of one recoil temperature per coherence time . for our 100@xmath1k depth trap at @xmath148 nm the rate is 4.4@xmath1ks@xmath149 , implying that storage and transport for many seconds is possible .",
    "for simplicity , we have ignored the fact that there may be distinct longitudinal and transverse temperatures which do not equilibrate over the trapping timescales .      in this section",
    "we present calculations , performed using the method of section [ sec : num ] , for a practical substrate choice of sodium fluoride ( the lowest refractive index common mineral , with @xmath150 at a wavelength of 852 nm ) , and investigate how this changes the atom waveguide properties from those presented above .",
    "we increased @xmath151 to 1.7 ( dense flint glass , e.g. basf type ) in order to provide sufficient index difference from the substrate .    fixing the width at @xmath152",
    ", we found that a height @xmath153 gave the largest @xmath59 of @xmath154 , and allowed both modes to be sufficiently far from cut - off ( greater than half the power being carried inside the guide for both modes ) .",
    "the result is a goodness factor @xmath155 which is approximately half that of the @xmath84 case , with a corresponding halving of the achievable product of depth and coherence time according to ( [ eq : expt ] ) , and doubling of the heating rate at a given @xmath121 and @xmath20 according to ( [ eq : tdot ] ) .",
    "the shorter decay lengths of 56 nm and 68 nm ( compared to 93 nm and 137 nm for @xmath84 ) cause the typical trapping distance @xmath114 to be reduced by a factor of roughly 1.8 .",
    "we found that in order to reproduce the depth of @xmath156k and @xmath157 m of the upper trap of figure [ fig : pot ] ( with @xmath20 unchanged ) we needed @xmath158mw , giving @xmath159ms .",
    "the large power increase over the 1mw required for @xmath160 is explained by the fact that this @xmath114 is now towards the upper limit practically achievable rather than the lower .",
    "( if @xmath114 is instead scaled in proportion to the new decay lengths , the required increase in @xmath106 is only a factor 1.7 ) . in this example",
    ", we find the transverse oscillation frequencies have increased to @xmath161khz and @xmath162khz , compared to the original @xmath163khz and @xmath164khz .",
    "the increase in @xmath165 is explained entirely by the shorter decay lengths , and the increase in @xmath45 ( by a factor of over 3 ) is attributed to tighter optical mode shapes .",
    "it is clear that this latter effect outweighs the decrease in @xmath122 , implying that the inclusion of the substrate has actually _ increased _",
    "@xmath132 by 50% .    in summary ,",
    "the effects of including a realistic substrate limit the maximum trapping distance @xmath114 that can be achieved ( because of the reduction in decay lengths ) , lower the goodness factor , increase the heating rate and the required optical power , but also increase the oscillation frequencies . for our substrate choice ,",
    "each of these changes was approximately a factor of 2 , and we believe that they do not alter the basic practicality of implementing our proposed waveguide .",
    "the detailed electric field distribution is very important in calculating the trapping potential above the waveguide .",
    "an approximation to the form of the fields in the y direction is given by the analytically - known solution for the slab waveguide , but to get more accuracy and knowledge of the full potential shape in the x - y plane , we used a full - vector finite element calculation .",
    "the technique represents the electric and magnetic fields as simple piecewise functions over many `` elements '' ( regions ) subdividing a slice through the guide and surrounding media in the xy plane , therefore by a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "each element has a dielectric constant associated with it , allowing arbitrary stepwise refractive index distributions in the xy plane to be modelled .",
    "maxwell s equations for propagating solutions of the form @xmath166 are reduced to a generalized sparse eigenvalue equation with @xmath167 as the eigenvalue and the bound mode field distributions as the eigenvectors @xcite .",
    "specifically , we used the technique of fernandez and lu @xcite , with @xmath68 and @xmath168 as the field degrees of freedom , for simplicity using first - order ( bilinear ) functions to represent these fields over a non - uniform but separable rectangular grid of elements .",
    "this required a generalization of the fernandez and lu implementation , and careful consideration of their line - integral terms ( which are non - standard for a finite element formulation ) @xcite .",
    "of the many available finite element approaches to dielectric waveguide mode solving , this frequency - domain method was chosen for its absence of ` spurious modes ' , its ability to handle index step discontinuities , its small number of required degrees of freedom and its matrix sparsity@xcite .",
    "rather than emulating a radiative boundary condition ( a notoriously hard task usually requiring an iterative procedure due to the @xmath71 dependence ) , we enclosed the problem in a large , perfectly - conducting box of sufficient size that the bound mode evanescent fields were negligible on its walls , making the nature of the boundary condition irrelevant .",
    "however , the average level spacing of the unbound modes ( the ` continuum ' ) decreases with increasing box size , and especially near cut - off this increases the number of iterations required to solve the eigenvalue problem to a given accuracy ( we used the well - known arpack solver to find the 11 lowest eigenmodes of the sparse matrix ) .",
    "we found that a box size of @xmath169 to @xmath170 gave the best compromise between accuracy and speed .",
    "our non - uniform elements allowed us to have a high element density across the waveguide and in the trapping region , but a low density over the much larger box area , keeping the total number of degrees of freedom manageable .",
    "the fractional error @xmath171 in the propagation constant @xmath71 was less than @xmath172 , and the accuracy of the electric field strengths in the trapping region @xmath173 , when we used @xmath174 elements .",
    "this was sufficiently accurate for the present work .",
    "finding the bound modes of each waveguide parameter choice typically took between 3 and 20 minutes of computing time on a silicon graphics r8000 processor , depending on how close to cut - off the guide was .",
    "we tested the accuracy of the method by solving a cylindrical guide in an identical fashion with the same @xmath175 and a very similar non - uniform grid , for which there are known field solutions @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : num ] shows the propagation constant agrees with the analytics to within 1% , even close to cut - off .",
    "the convergence with @xmath175 was measured for the rectangular guide case , and found to be @xmath176 with @xmath177 .",
    "this is less than optimal for first - order elements ( which have a maximum possible convergence of @xmath178 ) , and is believed to be due to an inability of the bilinear functions to represent physical in - plane @xmath179 and @xmath61 components at dielectric steps , or the weak field singularities which can physically occur at any exterior dielectric sharp edges ( regardless of whether acute or obtuse)@xcite .",
    "future improvements to the method , which would increase the accuracy or the convergence rate @xmath180 , include using higher order elements ( if done carefully , this could correctly represent physical @xmath179 and @xmath61 components at dielectric steps ) , and explicit modelling of the field singularities at guide corners using specialized elements .",
    "the ew trap has the benefit of creating high field gradients near a surface , but along with this comes the disadvantage that interactions with that surface that can alter the trap potential and even cause heating and loss of trapped atoms .    an atom s change in potential near a surface",
    "is known as the van der waals interaction ( @xmath181 ) or the casimir interaction ( @xmath182 ) , depending on the distance @xmath183 from the surface compared to @xmath11 , the dominant wavelength responsible for the polarizability of the atom ( in our case of cs this is the d line resonance , the same as our trapping resonance ) .",
    "there is a smooth cross - over from van der waals ( @xmath184 , which can be viewed as the atom s electrostatic interaction with the image of its own fluctuating dipole ) to casimir ( @xmath185 , which can be viewed as a retarded van der waals attraction or equally well as an atomic level shift due to a cavity qed effect ) at @xmath186@xcite . in the case of a perfect mirror surface",
    ", the full form is known for any @xmath183 , but for a dielectric surface , the expression becomes much more complicated to evaluate@xcite .",
    "since our trapping distances are larger than this cross - over point , we will use the casimir form , which is correct for asymptotically large @xmath183 , and is always an overestimate of the true potential@xcite .",
    "the dependence of the coefficient with dielectric constant is complicated @xcite , but we will use the simpler approximate form given by spruch and tikochinsky@xcite , to give @xmath187 ( in the mksa system ) . this approximate form is known to be within 6% of the exact expression for any dielectric constant @xmath171 @xcite . substituting the recently calculated@xcite static polarizability of cesium , @xmath188 a.u .",
    ", gives a casimir interaction coefficient of 4.9nk@xmath1m@xmath189 for @xmath83 .",
    "figure [ fig : geom]b shows the effect of this potential on a typical trap of depth 150@xmath1k and distance @xmath190 nm . it is clear that the change is negligible further than 100 nm from the surface , and a wkb tunneling calculation along this straight - line path ( at @xmath90 ) shows that even if all atoms that reach the surface stick , the loss rate from the first few transverse modes is entirely negligible .",
    "however , care should be taken with the multi - mode regime , or in the case of high-@xmath103 traps , since the tunneling via the corners of the `` bean '' shape may dominate for @xmath191 ( figure [ fig : pot ] ) .",
    "the issue of energy transfer to trapped atoms due to a finite ( and possibly room ) temperature nearby surface is far less well understood , and may be a problem with many surface - based particle traps , as discussed by henkel and wilkens @xcite . however , since we are trapping neutral particles and the conductivity of our surface is low , we expect a decoherence rate negligible compared to that already present from spontaneous absorption and emission cycles .",
    "it would be very useful to be able to carry atom beams along curved paths , by bending our atom waveguide in the plane of the substrate , without significant atom loss .",
    "here we briefly estimate three limitations on the waveguide minimum bending radius ( in decreasing order of leniency ) : 1 ) the limit imposed by optical radiation leakage , 2 ) the limit needed for incoherent atom transport , and 3 ) the limit needed for coherent atom transport in the transverse groundstate .",
    "this will give us an idea of the practicality of curved atomic guides .",
    "firstly , whenever a dielectric optical guide has curvature , there is a loss rate ( exponentially small in the curvature radius @xmath192 ) , which can be viewed as tunneling out of the guide s ` potential well ' induced by the addition of an effective centrifugal potential . in the limit @xmath193 , the effective",
    "potential is linear with x ( the radial coordinate ) , and the fractional loss per radian of curvature can be estimated@xcite , for instance using the one - dimensional wkb formula , to be @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the evanescent decay length in the radial direction , and @xmath196 is a constant of order unity . therefore for negligible light loss at a @xmath197 bend we need @xmath198 , typically a couple of tens of microns .",
    "this is so small chiefly because we are using an optical guide with a large refractive index step@xcite .",
    "secondly , we consider atom loss from an incoherent beam with a transverse temperature @xmath199 ( assumed small compared to the trap depth magnitude @xmath121 ) , and a longitudinal kinetic energy @xmath200 .",
    "we call the approximate spatial extent of the trap potential in the x direction @xmath201 , and restrict ourselves to one - dimensional classical motion in this direction .",
    "when in a region of radius of curvature @xmath202 , an effective centrifugal term adds to the trapping potential giving @xmath203 .",
    "this causes the atoms to ` slosh ' towards positive x , only ever returning if there exists a point where @xmath204 for @xmath205 .",
    "we can estimate that this will happen if @xmath206 , giving our lower limit on @xmath192 as @xmath207 . in our design @xmath208 m , so if we choose @xmath209 mm we can expect loss - free transport of a beam at a longitudinal kinetic energy up to @xmath210 times the trap depth .",
    "thirdly , to model coherent matter - wave propagation along a curved guide , we consider the amplitude for remaining in the transverse ground - state , having passed into a curved section and back into a straight section .",
    "if again we assume one - dimensional x motion , and assume a harmonic potential @xmath211 around the trap minimum , then the effect of curvature is to shift the minimum position from @xmath212 to @xmath213 .",
    "if this shift is much less than the characteristic ground - state size @xmath214 then the projection at each transition will be high , resulting in high flux transmission coefficient .",
    "this gives @xmath215 as our condition , which for @xmath216mk ( that is , @xmath217ms@xmath149 ) and @xmath218khz corresponds to @xmath219 mm .",
    "this limit is very conservative since we have not yet made use of the adiabatic condition @xmath220 ( where @xmath221 is the rate of change of direction of the guided atom ) , to design a waveguide path without discontinuities in the curvature .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that it is possible to bend atoms both incoherently and coherently through large angles on a compact substrate structure of a few millimeters in size .",
    "we have presented a novel substrate - based neutral atom waveguide , based on the optical dipole force , which combines the features of a planar far - detuned two - color evanescent trap@xcite with the ability to confine strongly along two axes .",
    "we utilized the differing vertical decay lengths of the two bound - mode _ polarizations _ of a submicron - sized optical waveguide near cut - off .",
    "we have shown that only a few milliwatts of guided laser power can create atomic potential depths @xmath222k with transverse oscillation frequencies @xmath223khz , a coherence time @xmath224ms and a trap minimum 200 - 400 nm above the optical guide surface , for cs atoms in the @xmath3 state .",
    "laser powers greater than ten milliwatts can give a transverse mode spacing greater than the temperature of a cs mot , opening up the single - mode waveguide regime .",
    "the advantages of guiding optical trapping fields on a substrate include mechanical stability and reliability , mass production and the potential for transport along complicated paths .",
    "we have given some design criteria for guided - lightwave two - color atom waveguides ( chiefly the maximization of the evanescent decay lengths , and of their normalized difference @xmath59 ) , and shown that a substrate of low refractive index can be very beneficial .",
    "we modelled in detail the trapping potentials for a general rectangular guide of index 1.56 above a unity - index substrate , and have shown that a realistic substrate choice of index 1.32 poses few problems to the viability of the device .",
    "we predict that the effect of the surface interaction is generally small , and that coherent guiding is possible around corners of radii @xmath225 mm for a longitudinal velocity @xmath225ms@xmath149 .",
    "we also believe that the magnetic part of the potential felt by nonzero @xmath8 atoms could be used to increase the depth and oscillation frequencies further .    this preliminary work ( specifically equation ( [ eq : tradeoff ] ) )",
    "indicates that utilizing detunings much larger than the 15 nm we limit ouselves to here will be very advantageous for coherent guiding .",
    "we have only scratched the surface of the design variations possible ; for instance , equalizing the horizontal and vertical oscillation frequencies is yet to be attempted .",
    "the use of two polarizations is our solution to the problem of maximizing @xmath59 when the detuning is very small compared to the wavelength , but we suspect that there will exist other fruitful schemes where these are comparable ( @xmath226 , very far - detuning ) and where a large @xmath59 is caused simply by the different optical cut - off conditions at the two wavelengths .",
    "we have reserved investigation of cooling schemes for future work ( although this has already been demonstrated in an ew mirror@xcite and proposed in ew traps@xcite ) .",
    "we believe that the potential shapes capable of being produced by guided waves on a substrate also include the possibility of funnel - type loading schemes and coherent atom couplers , allowing for a complete `` integrated '' atom - optical experiment on a substrate .",

    "<S> our design has many desirable experimental features : 1 ) very little optical power is required to obtain large trapping intensities since the optical bound mode has very small cross sectional area ( @xmath14 ) , 2 ) the optical field is _ non - divergent _ , so can be maintained over distances orders of magnitude further than diffraction - limited propagation in free space allows , 3 ) the trapping potential is well - known , mechanically stable , and insensitive to experimental parameters other than the optical powers , since it is defined by single - mode intensity distributions fixed relative to a substrate , 4 ) fabrication of arrays of closely spaced atom waveguides is possible@xcite , for parallel lithography or measurement , creating `` on - chip '' integrated atom - optical elements , 5 ) the atoms are exposed providing additional optical and physical access ( a feature not shared with hollow - fiber designs ) , and 6 ) the velocity of the atoms along the direction of the waveguide could be controlled by standing waves in the light carried by the optical guide @xcite .    compared to a zeeman - effect magnetic trap for neutral atoms , far - detuned optical dipole - force traps can have comparable trapping times , but typically an order of magnitude less depth and transverse mode spacings than recent magnetic traps @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> also , optical traps have the advantage that there is no significant loss mechanism which can remove atoms from the trap ( assuming the thermal energy is much less than the trap depth ) : spontaneous events cause a small heating rate , and non - adiabatic changes in @xmath8 can change the optical potential but not the fact that the atom remains trapped . </S>",
    "<S> this is to be contrasted with a non - adiabatic spin - flip event in a magnetic trap , which results in loss of the atom . </S>",
    "<S> this makes optical waveguides particularly attractive for incoherent transport , when the loss of coherence due to the spontaneous events is unimportant . </S>",
