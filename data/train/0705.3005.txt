    "_ discrete tomography _ ( the word `` tomography '' is derived from the greek @xmath0 , meaning a slice ) is concerned with the inverse problem of retrieving information about some _",

    "a typical example is the _ reconstruction _ of a finite point set in euclidean @xmath1-space from its line sums in a small number of directions .",
    "more precisely , a ( _ discrete parallel _ ) _ x - ray _ of a finite subset of euclidean @xmath2-space @xmath3 in direction @xmath4 gives the number of points of the set on each line in @xmath3 parallel to @xmath4 .",
    "this concept should not be confused with @xmath5-rays in diffraction theory , which provide rather different information on the underlying structure that is based on statistical pair correlations ; compare  @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in the classical setting , motivated by crystals ,",
    "the positions to be determined form a subset of a common translate of the cubic lattice @xmath6 or , more generally , of an arbitrary lattice @xmath7 in @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , many of the problems in discrete tomography have been studied on @xmath9 , the classical planar setting of discrete tomography ; see  @xcite , @xcite and  @xcite . beyond the case of perfect crystals , one has to take into account wider classes of sets , or at least significant deviations from the lattice structure . as an intermediate step between periodic and random ( or amorphous ) delone sets , we consider systems of _ aperiodic order _ , more precisely , so - called _ model sets _ ( or _ mathematical quasicrystals _ ) , which are commonly regarded as good mathematical models for quasicrystalline structures in nature  @xcite .",
    "our interest in the discrete tomography of model sets is mainly motivated by the task of structure determination of quasicrystals , a new type of solids discovered @xmath10 years ago ; see  @xcite for the pioneering paper and  @xcite for background and applications .",
    "more precisely , we address the problem of uniquely reconstructing three - dimensional quasicrystals from their images under quantitative _ high resolution transmission electron microscopy _ ( hrtem ) in a small number of directions .",
    "in fact , in  @xcite and  @xcite a technique is described , based on hrtem , which can effectively measure the number of atoms lying on lines parallel to certain directions ; it is called quantitem ( * * qu**antitative * * an**alysis of * * t**he * * i**nformation from * * t**ransmission * * e**lectron * * m**icroscopy ) . at present",
    ", the measurement of the number of atoms lying on a line can only be approximately achieved for some crystals ; _ cf .",

    "note that the terminology originates from the fact that the underlying @xmath12-modules ( to be explained in section  [ sec3 ] ) of b - type and f - type icosahedral model sets can be obtained as projections of body - centred and face - centred hypercubic lattices in @xmath13-space , respectively .",
    "the f - type icosahedral phase is the most common among the icosahedral quasicrystals .",
    "below , we nevertheless develop the theory for both the b - type ( also called i - type ) and the f - type phase .",
    "well known examples of icosahedral quasicrystals include the aluminium alloys almn and alcufe ; _ cf .",

    "this is due to the fact that @xmath5-rays in non-@xmath11-directions are meaningless since the resolution coming from such @xmath5-rays would not be good enough to allow a quantitative analysis ",

    "[ m+1 ] , it is shown that the finite subsets @xmath18 of cardinality less than or equal to some @xmath20 of a fixed icosahedral model set @xmath11 are determined by any set of @xmath21 @xmath5-rays in pairwise non - parallel @xmath11-directions .",
    "proposition  [ bounded ] then shows that , for every @xmath22 and any fixed icosahedral model set @xmath11 , there are two non - parallel @xmath11-directions such that the set of bounded subsets of @xmath11 with diameter less than @xmath23 is determined by the @xmath5-rays in these directions . for our main result , we restrict the set of finite subsets of a fixed icosahedral model set @xmath11 by considering the class of _ convex _ subsets of @xmath11 .",

    "in fact , it turns out that one can choose four @xmath11-directions which provide uniqueness and yield dense lines in icosahedral model sets , the latter making this result look promising in view of real applications ( example  [ u5 ] and remark  [ rempl ] ) .",
