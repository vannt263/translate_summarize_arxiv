    "superconductivity@xcite and quantum hall effects@xcite are known to present two distinct and interesting examples of zero - resistance states in material systems .",
    "another interesting example occurs in the quantum hall two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) when the 2des is irradiated with microwave and terahertz band radiation in the presence of a transverse magnetic field . here",
    ", it becomes possible to photo - excite into zero - resistance states in this low dimensional system.@xcite    = 3.0 in = 7.0 in    = 3.5 in = 3.5 in    photo - excited transport in the 2des has become a topic of experimental and theoretical interest since this observation.@xcite periodic in @xmath5 radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations , which lead into the radiation - induced zero - resistance states , are now understood to be a consequence of radiation - frequency ( @xmath6 ) and magnetic field ( @xmath7 ) dependent , scattering at impurities @xcite and/or a change in the distribution function@xcite . and , vanishing resistance at the oscillatory minima is explained as a feature of negative resistance instability and current domain formation.@xcite in spite of the progress , there remain many aspects that could be better understood from including , for example , the growth of the oscillatory effect vs. the radiation intensity , @xmath4 . here",
    ", a number of works have numerically evaluated the radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations for several @xmath4 and graphically presented the results,@xcite while dmitriev et al.,@xcite have suggested that the correction to the dark dc conductivity is linear in @xmath4.@xcite a comparison of experiment with theory , so far as the @xmath4-dependence is concerned , could help to identify the importance of the invoked - mechanisms in these theories.@xcite    thus , we examine the growth of the radiation - induced magneto - resistance oscillations with @xmath4 .",
    "experiment indicates that the amplitude @xmath2 of the radiation - induced oscillatory diagonal resistance ( @xmath0 ) , grows nonlinearly with @xmath4 and can be described by @xmath1 where the exponent @xmath8 . at the same time , according to experiment , @xmath9 also depends on the lattice temperature @xmath10 and radiation frequency @xmath6 . since",
    "such non - linear growth of @xmath2 with @xmath4 , @xmath10 , and @xmath6 had not been predicted , we propose a theoretical explanation .",
    "the explanation utilizes the _ radiation - driven electron orbit model_,@xcite where radiation forces the orbit center of the landau states to move back and forth in the direction of the radiation electric field at the frequency of radiation , and the @xmath0 oscillations reflect the periodic motion of the electron orbits center .",
    "this theory establishes that the amplitude ( @xmath11 ) of the orbit center motion , sets the amplitude @xmath2 of the @xmath0 oscillations , and that @xmath11 is proportional to the radiation electric field .",
    "since the radiation power @xmath4 is proportional to the square of the radiation electric field , it follows that @xmath0 and @xmath2 will depend on the square root of @xmath4 , at the lowest temperatures .",
    "the experiments indicate that @xmath9 is close to @xmath12 at lower temperatures .",
    "the above mentioned theory@xcite was proposed to explain the @xmath0 of an irradiated 2des at low @xmath7 .",
    "we obtained the exact solution of the corresponding electronic wave function@xcite : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the solution for the schrdinger equation of the unforced quantum harmonic oscillator , @xmath15 is the center of the orbit for the electron motion , @xmath16 is the classical solution of a forced harmonic oscillator : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the electron charge , @xmath19 is a phenomenologically - introduced damping factor for the electronic interaction with acoustic phonons , @xmath20 the cyclotron frequency , @xmath21 the radiation electric field .",
    "then , the obtained wave function is the same as the standard harmonic oscillator where the center is displaced by @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the orbit centers are not fixed , but they oscillate harmonically at the radiation field frequency @xmath22 .",
    "then , by this micro(mw)-driven periodic motion , electrons in their orbits ( quantum oscillators ) interact with the lattice ions being damped and emitting acoustic phonons . in the @xmath23 expression",
    ", @xmath19 represents this damping .",
    "this @xmath24 behavior affects dramatically the charged impurity scattering and eventually the conductivity .",
    "then , first we calculate the impurity scattering rate @xmath25 between two @xmath26 landau states @xmath27 , and @xmath28@xcite .",
    "next we find the average effective distance advanced by the electron in every scattering jump : @xmath29@xcite , where @xmath30 is the scattering time .",
    "finally the longitudinal conductivity @xmath31 is given by : @xmath32 being @xmath33 the energy .",
    "to obtain @xmath0 we use the relation @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , @xmath37 and the amplitude of resistance oscillations depends linearly on the radiation electric field .",
    "@xmath4 can be related with @xmath0 through the well - known formula that gives radiation intensity @xmath38 ( power divided by surface ) in terms of the radiation electric field @xmath21 : @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath41 is the permittivity in vacuum . if we want to express only the power in terms of the radiation electric field we have to take into account the sample surface .",
    "in the particular case of gaas if @xmath42 is the sample surface , we can readily obtain : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the speed of light in gaas and @xmath45 is the gaas dielectric constant .",
    "accordingly , @xmath46 .",
    "then , substituting in the expression of @xmath11 , we obtain that @xmath0 varies with @xmath4 following an square root law : @xmath47    thus , the @xmath0 response will grow as the square root of @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath48 . from the expression of",
    "@xmath0 we can study the influence of @xmath49 and @xmath10 on the sublinear relation . in the case of @xmath49 ,",
    "the calculation is straightforward ( see expressions of @xmath0 or @xmath11 ) . in the case of @xmath10",
    ", we introduce a microscopic model , which allow us to obtain the damping parameter @xmath19 and its dependence on @xmath10 @xcite . according to the model",
    ", @xmath19 is proportional to the scattering rate of electron - acoustic phonon interaction , being eventually linear with @xmath10@xcite .",
    "low frequency lock - in based electrical measurements were carried out at @xmath50 with the samples immersed in pumped liquid - helium and mounted near the open end of a microwave waveguide.@xcite the w ( wegscheider)-gaas / algaas single heterostructures were nominally characterized by an electron density , @xmath51 and a mobility of @xmath52 .",
    "results are reported here for measurements on a set of three w - specimens .    to examine the growth of the radiation - induced oscillations with @xmath4 , fig .",
    "1 presents the @xmath53 of specimen w1 for several @xmath4 at @xmath54 .",
    "also shown in the figure are data - fits to @xmath55 . here ,",
    "a slowly varying background , approximately equaling the dark trace , was removed from the photo - excited @xmath0 data to realize @xmath53.@xcite although this fit function includes three parameters , @xmath2 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , the oscillation period in @xmath5 is independent of the radiation - intensity , and thus , @xmath57 is a constant .",
    "further , the damping constant , @xmath56,@xcite turns out to be insensitive to @xmath4 , see fig .",
    "thus , the main free parameter in the fit - function is the amplitude , @xmath2 , of the oscillations . in fig .",
    "1(c ) , we exhibit the fit extracted @xmath2 vs. @xmath4 for w1 and w2 .",
    "the figure shows a sub - linear growth of @xmath2 with @xmath4 .",
    "also shown are power law fits , @xmath58 . here , @xmath59 and @xmath60 for w1 and w2 , respectively , at @xmath61 and @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath62 varies between w1 and w2 because the effective intensity attenuation factor varies between the two experiments .    for a third w - specimen labeled w3 , fig .",
    "1(d ) and 1(e ) report the influence of the temperature on the growth of @xmath2 vs. @xmath4 , where @xmath2 is extracted , as before , from line - shape fits of the oscillatory data to @xmath63 . here , fig .",
    "1(d ) and 1(e ) indicate that , as expected , at a constant @xmath4 , @xmath2 grows with decreasing @xmath10 both at @xmath64 [ fig .",
    "1(d ) ] and @xmath65 [ fig 1(e ) ] .",
    "further , the figures show that the @xmath2 vs. @xmath4 curves exhibit greater curvature at lower temperatures .",
    "the @xmath2 vs. @xmath4 have been fit once again to @xmath66 ; the fit - extracted @xmath9 and @xmath62 have been summarized in tabular form within fig .",
    "1(d ) and fig .",
    "these fit - extracted @xmath9 have also been plotted vs. @xmath10 in the inset to these figures .",
    "these insets suggest that @xmath9 decreases with decreasing temperatures , consistent with the observed increased non - linearity at lower temperatures .",
    "note that , at @xmath67 , all three w - specimens , exhibit the same @xmath9 , within uncertainties , at the lowest pumped @xmath68he temperatures . in addition , a comparison of the @xmath9 reported in fig .",
    "1(d ) and fig .",
    "1(e ) also suggests that reducing the microwave frequency @xmath6 at a fixed @xmath10 tends to reduce the @xmath9 , i.e. , increase the non - linearity .",
    "thus , the experimental results presented here suggest a nonlinear power law in a regime characterized by modest excitation . this peculiar behavior can be theoretically explained and the experimental results recovered by means of the radiation - driven electron orbits model .",
    "next we present the calculated results that seem to reasonably agree with the present experiments .",
    "fig . 2 presents the calculated @xmath0 as a function of @xmath7 over @xmath69 at @xmath70 and @xmath71 . as in experiments , we obtain multiple oscillations for all @xmath4 except , as expected , for @xmath72 .",
    "it is clear the progressive collapse of @xmath0 oscillations as @xmath4 decreases .",
    "the explanation is straightforward according to our theory and it is given by the expression of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , for a decreasing ( increasing ) @xmath4 the @xmath0 response is progressively smaller ( larger ) .",
    "the key issue here , and the challenge for the different available theories , is to deduce the rate of increase ( decrease ) of @xmath0 oscillations for increasing ( decreasing ) @xmath4 .",
    "this is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "2 , where we present the calculated amplitude versus @xmath4 . as in experiments ,",
    "we obtain a clear sublinear growth of @xmath2 with @xmath4 : @xmath73 .",
    "we would expect an exponent @xmath9 around @xmath12 since the model establishes an square root dependence .",
    "thus , we have performed a fit of the calculated values , obtaining @xmath74 , very close to a square root law .",
    "= 3.5 in = 5.2 in    the dependence of the sublinear law on @xmath10 and frequency is presented in fig .",
    "3 . in fig . 3a we represent the calculated amplitude @xmath2 of the main @xmath0 peak versus @xmath4 for a frequency of @xmath54 and @xmath10 values : @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "we obtain a qualitatively similar behavior as in experiments .",
    "thus , we observe that for a constant @xmath4 , @xmath2 increases ( decreases ) with decreasing ( increasing ) @xmath10 . the physical explanation is a follows .",
    "if one increases @xmath10 , the interaction between electrons and lattice ions also increases giving rise to a more intense damping .",
    "this implies progressively smaller amplitudes and @xmath0 oscillations tend to vanish . on the other hand",
    ", it is very clear that for all @xmath10 used in the calculation , the dependence between @xmath2 and @xmath4 is sub - linear and that , at least qualitatively , the curves show a bigger curvature for decreasing @xmath10 . to check this curvature ,",
    "we have made a fit to the calculated values for each @xmath10 observing that the exponent of the fits slightly increases for increasing @xmath10 . in all cases ,",
    "the exponent is always close to 0.5 .",
    "this outcome is expected since , strictly speaking , our model does not predict any variation of the exponent with @xmath10 ; our theoretical framework imposes a square root relation . yet",
    ", experimental results show a much faster increase of the exponent with increasing @xmath10 regarding the calculated ones .",
    "the latter show a much slower variation with @xmath10 , although in the same direction . at present",
    ", this model can not explain this quantitative discrepancy of the variation of @xmath9 with @xmath10",
    ". this discrepancy could be the result of an statistical effect of the fit or the reflex of a real physical process .",
    "in the latter case , this would imply an extension of the current theory that should start from the square root law obtained here .",
    "we consider that the square root dependence is a solid result reflecting a reasonably good agreement between theory and experiments a low temperatures .    a similar behavior is presented in fig .",
    "3b where we show the calculated values of @xmath2 versus @xmath4 for different frequencies .",
    "we observe that , as in experiments , @xmath2 decreases as the the frequency increases .",
    "the explanation comes from the expression of @xmath0 where @xmath49 shows up in the denominator .",
    "then , for a constant @xmath4 , a larger @xmath49 gives rise to smaller amplitudes .",
    "we have fit these curves and , as expected , the exponent of the fit slightly increases for increasing frequency whereas the pre - factor decreases . yet ,",
    "experiments show a much faster increase .",
    "this discrepancy is similar to the case of the @xmath10-dependence .",
    "thus , the explanation given in fig .",
    "3a , applies identically here too .",
    "all calculated results presented in figs . 2 and 3 , have been obtained directly through equation ( 6 ) .",
    "in summary , experimental results indicate a nonlinear growth in the amplitude @xmath2 of radiation - induced magneto - resistance oscillations with @xmath4 .",
    "these results can be explained with the radiation - driven electron orbits model . according to this model",
    ", the amplitude of the radiation - induced oscillations should be proportional to the square root of radiation power , which implies a sub - linear relation .",
    "we have also studied how this sub - linear law varies with lattice temperature and radiation frequency obtaining only a qualitative good agreement between theory and experiments .",
    "the obtained quantitative discrepancies can not be explained by our theory .",
    "the origin of them could be an statistical effect or a real physical effect . in the latter case",
    ", this would imply an extension of the present theoretical model , always starting from the square root law here obtained .",
