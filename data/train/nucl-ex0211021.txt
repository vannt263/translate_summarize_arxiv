    "`` the principles of thermodynamics are devised for giving a phenomenological account of the gross behavior of macroscopic physical systems , ... [ interpreting ] the average behavior of systems of many degrees of freedom . '' the ongoing search for a system of nuclear matter which can be described by a thermodynamic quark gluon plasma phase ( qgp ) must therefore involve a study of nuclear matter in bulk .",
    "for this reason , heavy ions with significant amounts of nuclear matter are used in laboratory experiments to find and study qgp .",
    "this also implies that qgp formation affects some bulk portion of the outgoing matter , most of which is in the `` soft '' , low-@xmath19  region of phase space .",
    "the star experiment at rhic has measured a rich variety of particle species and portions of their soft spectra in high energy @xmath20+@xmath20  and @xmath10+@xmath10  collisions  @xcite . because production , annihilation , and rescattering processes differ among the particle species , their abundances and spectra reflect on different aspects of the collision evolution .",
    "we present here a discussion of these aspects as elucidated by our measurements .",
    "we will follow an outline of the physics topics along the evolution from initial collisions to final reinteractions of the products .",
    "improved statistics in the second year of physics running at rhic have given star the ability to measure unidentified charged hadron transverse momentum ( @xmath19 ) spectra from 0.2 gev/@xmath21 to @xmath2212 gev/@xmath21 .",
    "these spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fi : spectra ] as a function of centrality for @xmath20+@xmath20  collisions .",
    "they have been corrected for decays and backgrounds through detailed simulation  @xcite .",
    "the corrections are @xmath19  and multiplicity dependent , but nowhere exceed 20% . from these inclusive spectra we can measure total yields as well as @xmath23@xmath19@xmath24 .",
    "this is done by fitting the spectra with a power law of the form @xmath25",
    "the @xmath19-integrated multiplicity requires extrapolation of the power law at the low-@xmath19  end , which comprises up    r0.51    [ fi : spectra ]    to 21% of the yields . for the 5% most central events ,",
    "our preliminary results indicate that the average charged hadronic multiplicity @xmath23@xmath26@xmath24 increases from 563@xmath2739 to 687@xmath2769 between @xmath28 = 130 and 200 gev .",
    "@xmath23@xmath19@xmath24  is then obtained from the same power law , giving 0.520@xmath272.3% gev/@xmath21 at @xmath28 = 130 gev and 0.524@xmath272.3% gev/@xmath21 at 200 gev . for both @xmath23@xmath26@xmath24 and @xmath23@xmath19@xmath24  measurements",

    "this implies that @xmath29+@xmath29  is not just a simple superposition of nucleon+nucelon  collisions  @xcite , and argues against a universality in particle production  @xcite suggested from total particle yields  @xcite .",
    "conserved quantities must survive any evolution .",
    "the conserved net - baryon number is established from the incoming nuclei , but becomes spread over the rapidity interval by initial interactions ( often called @xmath32 , though not strictly stopped ) , and then additionally smeared by the rescattering processes ; together these make up the transport of baryon number from the nuclei to their final rapidities .",
    "the midrapidity baryon and antibaryon yields thus have folded into them these transport distributions along with components from baryon - antibaryon pair production ( and annihilation , which may also contribute to transport ) processes .",
    "r0.5    a characterization of the baryon - antibaryon differences is made in fig .",
    "[ fi : baryons ] .",
    "this plot shows the antibaryon to baryon ratios at midrapidity for various species in central heavy ion collisions .",
    "it is clear from the plot that the ratios tend towards one with increasing strangeness content , and with increasing energy .",
    "the ratios are not corrected for feeddown , and the @xmath10 and @xmath11  are essentially inclusive .",
    "these ratios indicate that the yield of baryons resulting from pair production processes has begun to dominate over those from transport at rhic energies : the ratio of those contributions from inclusive ( anti)protons in central @xmath20+@xmath20  is @xmath222.5 at @xmath28 = 130 gev , derived from inclusive @xmath11/@xmath10=0.72@xmath270.05(@xmath33 ) , and @xmath223.5 at 200 gev , from @xmath11/@xmath10=0.78@xmath270.05(@xmath33 ) .",
    "inclusion of strange quarks in the baryons appears to dilute the contributions of transport , enough to make the @xmath34 ratio consistent with 1 at rhic ; this is not the case at sps energies where the contributions from transport are still evident in the @xmath35 yields despite an initial net strange quark number of zero .",
    "star has also measured most of these antibaryon to baryon ratios as a function of centrality and sees only a slight rise in the antiproton to proton ratio for peripheral collisions , and no significant changes for the other ratios  @xcite .",
    "this implies little change in the relevance of pair production processes for baryon and antibaryon production despite the changing collision geometry and participants .    a definitive measure of the baryon number transported to midrapidity comes from the difference between yields of baryons and antibaryons at midrapidity .",
    "this is represented by the net inclusive proton number shown in fig .",
    "[ fi : netp](left ) .",
    "this number is clearly decreasing with increasing collision energy for large heavy ion collisions , while the yield of produced particles at midrapidity ( represented in fig .",
    "[ fi : netp](left ) by the negative hadron yield ) is monotonically increasing .",
    "this demonstrates the decreasing significance of baryon transport contributions to midrapidity yields and is not unexpected as the rapidity interval from the original nuclei is stretched .",
    "it is interesting that the baryon number transport is in fact still nonzero despite the interval of @xmath225 units in rapidity at 130 gev ( also true for @xmath226 rapidity units at 200 gev ) .",
    "some understanding of this may come from the asymmetric @xmath36 versus @xmath37 distributions even at low momentum fraction @xmath38=@xmath39 within the incoming nucleons  @xcite .",
    "several model predictions are also shown for the centrality plot , with hijing matching peripheral data best , and hijing / b@xmath40 ( which is intended to enhance the stopping  @xcite ) more closely approaching the central data .",

    "this means that pair production processes behind baryon yields are now dominant , but do not account for all baryon number ; there must remain some transport of baryon number even over @xmath225 and @xmath226 units of rapidity at 130 and 200 gev respectively .",
    "also , the @xmath23@xmath19@xmath24  systematics of inclusive hadron yields provide additional information about initial conditions for particle production .",
    "further investigations into photon spectra may help us understand the early environment of the collision system .",
    "particle yields seem , for the most part , to be well - described phenomenologically by statistical models .",
    "the data support thermal , chemical equilibrium fits to the yields .",
    "such fits proffer a system with thermodynamic properties of temperature and baryo - chemical potential in the region of the phase change predicted by lattice qcd calculations .",
    "evidence for transverse radial flow is observed in the transverse momentum spectra of observed particles .",
    "this is consistent with the observation of strong elliptic flow by star  @xcite .",
    "in addition , apparently slightly suppressed @xmath7 yields hint at hadronic rescattering which is short in duration if regeneration of the @xmath7 resonance is much less than the losses caused by rescattering of in - medium decay daughters .",
    "the star experiment at rhic continues to address a wide variety of physics topics in heavy ion and nucleon collisions .",
    "topics explored through measurements in the soft physics regime are strengths of the experiment and will persist in providing a better understanding of the collision dynamics throughout the collision evolution .    99 j. klay for the star collaboration , these proceedings . o. barannikova and f. wang for the star collaboration , @xmath83 .",
