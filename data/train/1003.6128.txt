    "<S> we prove that the local energy of linear waves in that background decays exponentially once orthogonality to the zero resonance is imposed .    </S>",
    "<S> quasi - normal modes are the complex frequencies appearing in expansions of waves ; their real part corresponds to the rate of oscillation and the nonpositive imaginary part , to the rate of decay . according to the physics literature  </S>",

    "<S> they were studied by bachelot and motet - bachelot  @xcite and s barreto and zworski  @xcite , who applied the methods of scattering theory and semiclassical analysis to the case of a spherically symmetric black hole . </S>",
    "<S> quasi - normal modes were described in  @xcite as * resonances * ; that is , poles of the meromorphic continuation of a certain family of operators ; it was also proved that these poles asymptotically lie on a lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this was further developed by bony and hfner in  @xcite , who established an expansion of the solutions of the wave equation in terms of resonant states . as a byproduct of this result </S>",
    "<S> , they obtained exponential decay of local energy for schwarzschild  de sitter . </S>",
    "<S> melrose , s barreto , and vasy  @xcite have extended this result to more general manifolds and more general initial data .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we employ different methods to define quasi - normal modes for the kerr  </S>",
    "<S> de sitter rotating black hole . as in  @xcite and  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we use the de sitter model ; physically , this corresponds to a positive cosmological constant ; mathematically , it replaces asymptotically euclidean spatial infinity with an asymptotically hyperbolic one . </S>",

    "<S> , it leaves invariant the space @xmath5 of distributions with fixed angular momentum @xmath6 ( with respect to the axis of rotation ) ; the inverse @xmath4 on @xmath5 is constructed by    [ t : r - g - omega - k ] let @xmath7 be the restriction of @xmath1 to @xmath5 . then there exists a family of operators @xmath8 meromorphic in @xmath2 with poles of finite rank and such that @xmath9 for each @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath11 is meromorphic , its poles , which we call @xmath12-resonances , form a discrete set . </S>",
    "<S> one can then say that @xmath2 is a resonance , or a quasi - normal mode , if @xmath13 is a @xmath12-resonance for some @xmath6 . however , it is desirable to know that resonances form a discrete subset of @xmath14 ; that is , @xmath12-resonances for different @xmath12 do not accumulate near some point . </S>",
    "<S> also , one wants to construct the inverse @xmath4 that works for all values of @xmath12 . for @xmath15 , , @xmath16 </S>",

    "<S> , the operator @xmath4 acts only on functions supported in a certain compact subset of the space slice @xmath31 depending on how small @xmath32 is . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that the operator @xmath1 is not elliptic inside the two ergospheres located near the endpoints @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the result above can then be viewed as a construction of @xmath4 away from the ergospheres . </S>",

    "<S> consider the function @xmath41 on the spacetime @xmath42 ; then @xmath36 is outgoing if and only if @xmath43 is smooth up to the event horizons in the extension of the metric given by the kerr - star coordinates @xmath44 discussed in section  1 . </S>",
    "<S> this lets us establish a relation between the wave equation on kerr - de sitter and the family of operators @xmath4 ( proposition  [ l : our - resolvent - relevance ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that here we do not follow earlier applications of scattering theory ( including  @xcite ) , where spectral theory and in particular self - adjointness of @xmath45 are used to define @xmath4 for @xmath46 and relate it to solutions of the wave equation via stone s formula . </S>",
    "<S> in the situation of the present paper , due to the lack of ellipticity of @xmath1 inside the ergospheres , it is doubtful that @xmath45 can be made into a self - adjoint operator ; therefore , we construct @xmath4 directly using separation of variables , cite the theory of hyperbolic equations ( see section  1 ) for well - posedness of the cauchy problem for the wave equation , and prove proposition  [ l : our - resolvent - relevance ] without any reference to spectral theory .    </S>",
    "<S> we now study the distribution of resonances in the slowly rotating kerr  de sitter case . </S>",
    "<S> first , we establish absense of nonzero resonances in the closed upper half - plane :    [ t : upper - half - plane ] fix @xmath15 . </S>",

    "<S> there are no resonances @xmath50 and @xmath51 where @xmath52 stands for a family of operators holomorphic at zero .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we use the methods of  @xcite and the fact that the only trapping in our situation is normally hyperbolic to get a resonance free strip :    [ t : resonance - free - strip ] fix @xmath15 and @xmath53 . then there exist @xmath25 , @xmath54 , and @xmath48 such that for @xmath26 , @xmath55 and  [ t : resonance - free - strip ] , together with the fact that resonances form a discrete set , imply that for @xmath56 small enough , zero is the only resonance in @xmath57 . this and the presence of the global meromorphic continuation provide exponential decay of local energy : ) , as well as a more precise description of resonances and a resonance decomposition ( http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.1260[`arxiv:1101.1260 ` ] ) ; all of these are based on the present paper . ]    </S>",

    "<S> let @xmath36 be a solution to the wave equation @xmath60 with initial data @xmath61 also , define the constant @xmath62 here @xmath63 denotes the hodge star operator for the metric @xmath64 ( see section  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath65 for certain constants @xmath48 and @xmath66 independent of @xmath36 .    for the kerr metric </S>",
    "<S> , the local energy decay is polynomial as shown by tataru and tohaneanu  @xcite , see also the lecture notes by dafermos and rodnianski  @xcite and the references below .    </S>",
    "<S> * outline of the proof . * </S>",
    "<S> the starting point of the construction of @xmath4 is the separation of variables introduced by teukolsky in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the separation of variables techniques and the related symmetries have been used in many papers , including  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; however , these mostly consider the case of zero cosmological constant , where other difficulties occur at zero energy and a global meromorphic continuation of the type presented here is unlikely . in our case , since the metric is invariant under axial rotation , it is enough to construct the operators @xmath11 and study their behavior for large @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the operator @xmath7 is next decomposed into the sum of two ordinary differential operators , @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( see  ) . </S>",
    "<S> the separation of variables is discussed in section  1 ; the same section contains the derivation of theorem  [ t : exponential - decay ] from the other theorems by the complex contour deformation method .    in the schwarzchild  de sitter case , @xmath68 is just the laplace  </S>",
    "<S> beltrami operator on the round sphere and one can use spherical harmonics to reduce the problem to studying the operator @xmath69 for large @xmath70 . in the case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath71 , however , the operator @xmath68 is @xmath13-dependent ; what is more , it is no longer self - adjoint unless @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> this raises two problems with the standard implementation of separation of variables , namely decomposing @xmath73 into a direct sum of the eigenspaces of @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , since @xmath68 is not self - adjoint , we can not automatically guarantee existence of a complete system of eigenfunctions and the corresponding eigenspaces need not be orthogonal . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the eigenvalues of @xmath68 are functions of @xmath13 , and meromorphy of @xmath4 is nontrivial to show when two of these eigenvalues coincide . therefore , instead of using the eigenspace decomposition , we write @xmath4 as a certain contour integral   in the complex plane ; the proof of meromorphy of this integral is based on weierstrass preparation theorem . </S>",
    "<S> this is described in section  2 .    in section  3 , </S>",
    "<S> we use the separation of variables procedure to reduce theorems  [ t : r - g - omega - k][t : upper - half - plane ] to certain facts about the radial resolvent @xmath74 ( proposition  [ l : radial ] ) . for fixed @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the separation constant , @xmath74 </S>",
    "<S> is constructed in section  4 using the methods of one - dimensional scattering theory . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the radial operator @xmath67 , after the regge  wheeler change of variables  , is equivalent to the schrdinger operator @xmath77 for a certain potential @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> ( here @xmath79 correspond to the event horizons . ) </S>",
    "<S> this does not , however , provide estimates on @xmath74 that are uniform as @xmath75 go to infinity .    </S>",
    "<S> the main difficulty then is proving a uniform resolvent estimate ( see  ) , valid for large @xmath70 and @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> a complication arises from the fact that @xmath81 , where @xmath82 are proportional to @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> no matter how large @xmath13 is , one can always choose @xmath12 so that one of @xmath82 is small , making it impossible to use standard complex scaling , in the case @xmath84 , due to the lack of ellipticity of the rescaled operator at infinity . </S>",
    "<S> to avoid this issue , we use the analyticity of @xmath78 and semiclassical analysis to get certain control on outgoing solutions at two distant , but fixed , points ( proposition  [ l : vertical ] ) , and then an integration by parts argument to get an @xmath73 bound between these two points . </S>",
    "<S> this is discussed in section  6 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , section  7 contains the proof of theorem  [ t : resonance - free - strip ] . </S>",
    "<S> we first use the results of sections  26 to reduce the problem to scattering for the schrdinger operator @xmath85 in the regime @xmath86 , @xmath87 ( proposition  [ l : resonance - free - radial ] ) . in this case , we apply complex scaling to deform @xmath85 near @xmath79 to an elliptic operator ( proposition  [ l : complex - scaling ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we then analyse the corresponding classical flow ; it is either nontrapping at zero energy , in which case the usual escape function construction ( as in , for example ,  @xcite ) applies ( proposition  [ l : radial - nontrapping ] ) , or has a unique maximum . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> we use the methods of  @xcite designed to handle more general normally hyperbolic trapped sets and based on commutator estimates in a slightly exotic microlocal calculus . </S>",
    "<S> the argument of  @xcite has to be modified to use complex scaling instead of an absorbing potential near infinity ( see also  ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * theorem  2 ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that , unlike  @xcite or  @xcite , the construction of @xmath4 in the present paper does not use the theorem of mazzeo  </S>",
    "<S> melrose  @xcite on the meromorphic continuation of the resolvent on spaces with asymptotically constant negative curvature ( see also  @xcite ) . in  @xcite and  @xcite , this theorem had to be applied to prove the existence of the meromorphic continuation of the resolvent for @xmath13 in a fixed neighborhood of zero where complex scaling could not be implemented .    </S>",
    "<S> * remark . </S>",
    "<S> * the results of this paper also apply if the wave equation is replaced by the klein  </S>",
    "<S> gordon equation  @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a fixed constant . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding stationary operator is @xmath90 ; when restricted to the space @xmath5 , it is the sum of the two operators ( see section  1 ) @xmath91 the proofs in this paper all go through in this case as well . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the rescaled radial operator @xmath85 introduced in   is a schrdinger operator with the potential @xmath92 since @xmath93 is still equal to @xmath94 with @xmath82 defined in  , the radial resolvent can be defined as a meromorphic family of operators on the entire complex plane . </S>",
    "<S> also , the term @xmath95 in the operator @xmath85 becomes of order @xmath96 under the semiclassical rescaling and thus does not affect the arguments in sections  6 and  7 .    </S>",
    "<S> the only difference in the klein  </S>",
    "<S> gordon case is the absense of the resonance at zero : @xmath97 is no longer an outgoing solution to the equation @xmath98 for @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , there is no @xmath100 term in theorem  [ t : exponential - decay ] , and all solutions to   decay exponentially in the compact set @xmath22 . </S>"
