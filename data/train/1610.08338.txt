    "among materials which have been drawing a permanently strong interest in the course of the last three decades are carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) .",
    "they are considered as one of the most promising semiconductor materials for developing a new element base of electronics .",
    "cnts are macromolecular objects , in the form of layers of graphene rolled into a cylinder , the surface of which is formed by six carbon cycles  @xcite .",
    "nanotubes can be single walled or multi - walled , if the tube is composed of one or several layers of graphene , respectively .",
    "the cnts are categorized as chiral , if angles between sides of the hexagons and nanotube axis are different from 0@xmath0 and 90@xmath0 , and achiral otherwise .",
    "further , achiral cnts exhibit two different structures : saddles , `` if the sides of the hexagons are perpendicular to the nanotube axis , or zigzags , '' with a parallel arrangement of the hexagons relative to the axis .    since the discovery of nanotubes by iijima  @xcite and up to now , a great deal of work has been done on the synthesis and characterization of different types of cnts ( see reviews  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there are detailed descriptions of physical properties of cnts , as defined by their geometry and surface structure , i.e. , the arrangement of the hexagonal carbon cycles relative to the axis of the nanotube .",
    "calculations of the band structure show that , depending on their build , the cnt may feature metallic , insulating , or semiconductor properties , that offer a great potential for applications  @xcite .",
    "peculiarities of the electron energy spectrum of semiconductor single - walled cnts of the zigzag type ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) are manifestations of a number of nonlinear electrodynamic properties similar to those in semiconductors with a superstructure , for instance , in quantum semiconductor superlattices 10,11 .",
    "non - quadratic electron dispersion suggests a possibility of realization ( in electric fields of moderate strength @xmath1@xmath2 v / cm ) of diverse nonlinear phenomena , such as nonlinear and absolute negative conductivity  @xcite , phase transitions of the first kind induced by the applied external field  @xcite , nonlinear diffraction and self - focusing of laser beams  @xcite , electromagnetic solitary waves  @xcite , etc .",
    "a wide range of applications to modern optoelectronics may stem from these phenomena .",
    "moreover , the recent advancement of laser physics in the generation of powerful electromagnetic radiation , including pulses of ultra - short duration with predetermined parameters  @xcite , is an incentive for a comprehensive study of the propagation of nonlinear electromagnetic waves , including extremely short pulses , in settings based on cnts .",
    "it was first predicted theoretically in ref .",
    "@xcite that the propagation of electromagnetic solitary waves in cnt arrays is possible in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) model . later",
    ", these results have been extended to more realistic multidimensional models .",
    "in particular , detailed studies of the propagation of two - dimensional ( 2d ) unipolar and bipolar extremely short electromagnetic pulses in cnt arrays have been carried out ( see refs .",
    "three - dimensional ( 3d ) spatiotemporal optical solitons (  light bullets \" @xcite ) have been considered too  @xcite .",
    "actual samples may contain various chemical impurities and structural defects , both intentionally produced ones or resulting from manufacture imperfections .",
    "the chemical impurities are uniformly distributed over a cnt array , affecting the dynamics of extremely short electromagnetic pulses 22,23,24 . in refs .",
    "@xcite , a detailed analysis has been developed for the propagation of unipolar solitary waves in a medium with metallic inclusions , while ref .",
    "@xcite established the selective nature of the interaction of an extremely short bipolar electromagnetic pulse with a spot featuring higher concentration of electrons , induced by a local dopant . moving towards a more realistic description of the solitary electromagnetic waves in cnt arrays ,",
    "one should gradually increase the complexity of the underlying model by considering factors that may occur in experimental situations .",
    "along with the possible presence of static heterogeneities in the medium , such as , for example , the local inhomogeneity of the conduction - electron density , it was found necessary to address the shape of the field of propagating electromagnetic pulses in 2d and 3d models ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the distribution of the electric field along the cnt axis causes , in turn , redistribution of the concentration of conduction electrons in the medium .",
    "thus , in general , there is another possible type of heterogeneity of the medium , namely , the dynamic inhomogeneity induced by the field of the propagating electromagnetic waves .",
    "effects associated with this type of the induced heterogeneity have never been thoroughly investigated , to the best of our knowledge .    obviously , each electromagnetic pulse propagating in the medium is affected by the spatiotemporal perturbation , induced by the  trace \" of the inhomogeneous distribution of the electron density caused by the passage of other pulses in the vicinity of a given one ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : electron - density ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is relevant to consider the propagation of extremely short electromagnetic pulses in the presence of a dynamical inhomogeneity induced by the fields of other pulses .",
    "this problem also has relevance to possible applications based on multiple rapid passages of electromagnetic pulses through the specimen .    in this vein",
    ", this work deals with collisions of 3d extremely short bipolar pulses ( light bullets ) , taking into account the interaction of each one with perturbations of the electron density induced by the field profile of the other pulse .",
    "the analysis aims to address the collisions in the form close to that observed in real experiments .",
    "to begin with , we have to clarify the term soliton \" used in this paper . strictly speaking",
    ", we do not provide a mathematical proof for the ultrashort waves we consider as being solitons ( see appendix a for the outline of this problem ) .",
    "specifically , we consider the propagation of a solitary electromagnetic wave ( infrared laser pulse ) through a volumetric array of semiconductor cnts forming a monolayer of the zigzag type , @xmath3 , where integer @xmath4 ( different from a multiple of three ) is the number of hexagonal carbon cycles which form the circumference of the nanotube .",
    "the second integer is the pitch of the helical pattern , also measured as the respective number of hexagonal carbon cycles , it is zero for a zigzag cnt .",
    "integer @xmath4 further determines the cnt radius , as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the distance between nearest - neighbor carbon atoms  @xcite .",
    "the cnts are supposed to be placed into a homogeneous insulator , so that axes of the nanotubes are parallel to the common @xmath7 axis , and distances between adjacent nanotubes are much larger than their diameter , allows one to neglect the interaction between cnts  @xcite ( see fig .  [ geometry ] ) . in particular , with this configuration one can neglect the electron inter - hopping , supposing that the corresponding wave functions do not overlap , which is important in order to avoid uncontrollable transverse currents .",
    "the cnt radius is @xmath8 for @xmath9 , which is the value adopted in the computations below .",
    "it is very small in comparison with the radiation wavelength in the infrared range , which exceeds @xmath10 .",
    "essentially , the chosen geometry of the problem is similar to the one considered in refs .",
    "@xcite . given this framework ,",
    "the dispersion relation for energy @xmath11 of conduction electrons of cnts is @xcite @xmath12where the electron quasimomentum is @xmath13 , @xmath14 being an integer characterizing the momentum quantization along the perimeter of the nanotube , @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the overlap integral , and @xmath17  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider the propagation of extremely short 3d pulses in direction @xmath18 perpendicular to cnt  axis @xmath7 , with the electric field of the pulses oriented along the @xmath7 axis ( see details below ) .",
    "the duration of each pulse is assumed to be much smaller than the electron relaxation time @xmath19 , which makes it possible to limit the evolution time to @xmath20 [ see eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) below ] , allowing one to consider the evolution of the electromagnetic field in the collisionless approximation @xcite .",
    "we treat the electromagnetic field in the cnt array by means of the maxwell s equations @xcite in terms of the vector and scalar potentials , @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in the chosen geometry ,",
    "the governing equation for the vector potential in the lorentz gauge is @xmath23with @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the current density , @xmath26 is the average relative dielectric constant of the medium @xcite , and @xmath27 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "the choice of the vector potential in the cnt collinear to the axes of the nanotubes is justified by the following considerations . according to the formulation of the problem ,",
    "the array has a nonzero electrical conductivity only along the @xmath7 axis , while the conduction current is negligible in the @xmath28 plane , given the vanishingly small interactions between the nanotubes , hence , the current density is defined as @xmath29 . in this case , eq .",
    "allows to nullify the second and third components of the vector potential , @xmath24 .    expanding the electron energy spectrum into a fourier series , and bearing in mind that the electrons obey the fermi - dirac statistics , we apply the technique developed in refs .",

    ".      fields of extremely short electromagnetic pulses under consideration are localized in all the three directions of the cartesian coordinates system .",
    "the nonuniformity of the field along the direction perpendicular to the cnt axis has no impact on the distribution of the electron concentration in the sample , as the interaction between the nanotubes is negligible , and , as said above , there is no electric current in the @xmath28 plane . on the contrary",
    ", the field nonuniformity along the @xmath7 axis perturbs the conduction - current density , which , in turn , affects the charge density in the sample  @xcite . in this connection",
    ", we note that concentration @xmath33 of the conduction electrons in the expression for the conduction current ( [ 3 ] ) and , consequently , the scaled electron concentration , @xmath51 , are , in general , functions of the coordinates and time , @xmath52 .",
    "obviously , the redistribution of the electron density leads to a change of the scalar potential .",
    "the maxwell s equations @xcite produce an evolution equation for the scalar potential ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath53where @xmath54 .      as mentioned above , the nonuniformity of the electric field along the cntaxis ( @xmath7 ) perturbs the current density in this direction , as follows from eq .  ,",
    "leading to redistribution of the electron density . the total charge in the sample being conserved , the change in the bulk charge density , @xmath55 , obeys the continuity equation , @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "projected onto the cnt  axis , this equation reads as @xmath57substituting eq .   into eq .  , and",
    "passing to the dimensionless notation , we obtain an evolution equation for the electron concentration under the action of the pulse s electromagnetic field : @xmath58 \\right\\ } ,   \\label{10}\\]]where @xmath59 .",
    "it is worth noting that the nonlinearity of the concentration of electrons [ see eq .",
    "] bears the same nature as the nonlinearity of the current density [ see eq .  ] , the latter being responsible for the reshaping of the electron concentration .",
    "furthermore , the accumulation of charge is a direct consequence of the inhomogeneity of the current along the cnts .",
    "accordingly , an additional electric field can appear , which is fully accounted for in this study .",
    "thus , the evolution of the field in the array , taking into regard the perturbation of the conduction - electron density due to the nonuniformity of the field along the cnt  axis , is governed by eqs . , , and .",
    "this is a self - consistent system for the coupled evolution of the field and electron density : the field impacts the dynamics of electrons , and the latter s feedback affects the evolution of the field , which resembles the vlasov s equations in plasma physics @xcite , and the recently studied local - field effect for the propagation of optical and microwave fields in atomic bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "measuring instruments can record the energy characteristics of the pulse defined by the electric field @xcite .",
    "the electric field in the cnt  array is determined by the potentials , @xmath60 @xcite , which can be written using the dimensionless variables defined above:@xmath61@xmath62thus , eq .",
    "demonstrates that the electric field can be represented as a superposition of two components , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is directed along the cnt axis , @xmath65and @xmath66 is the electric field in the orthogonal plane , @xmath67    electric field @xmath66 has no effect on the dynamics of electrons due to the absence of the conductivity in the @xmath28 plane .",
    "expression shows that field @xmath66 appears due to the perturbation of the conduction - electrons density and the presence of the scalar potential .",
    "this field is determined by the projection of vector @xmath68 onto the @xmath69 plane . in other words ,",
    "the nonuniformity of field @xmath64 along the cnt  axis gives rise to electric field @xmath66 in the orthogonal plane .",
    "as the conductivity of the array is different from zero only along the @xmath7 axis , the dynamics of the electron subsystem affects only electric field @xmath70 , which , in turn , is itself generated by the dynamics of electrons .",
    "the interaction of field @xmath64 with the electron subsystem gives rise to a self - consistent field of the electromagnetic solitary wave . to visualize the distribution of the wave field and identify its localization , we introduce @xmath71 .",
    "it has the dimension of the volume energy density @xcite , therefore we call it the bulk energy density of the electric field of the wave . following eqs .   and , it may be expressed as @xmath72where @xmath73 .",
    "numerical calculations reveal that the profile of @xmath74 may feature pronounced maxima , whose positions at any given moment in time are identified as position of the solitary waves .      concluding this section , we would like to specify two aspects which , from a methodological point of view , may be useful for modeling wave phenomena in nonlinear media .",
    "in general , there are at least two different approaches to the analysis of the problem .",
    "the primary focus here is on the mathematical scheme based upon the fourier expansion of dispersion relation   ( see appendix b ) , and we here explain the feasibility of this approach .",
    "current density   determines eq .   for the vector potential field , and eq .",
    "for the electron concentration .",
    "we stress that the expression for current density  , and therefore eqs . and , does not contain any explicit dependencies following from the particular form of function @xmath75 . in other words , for any medium , defined by its electron dispersion , which may be different from eq .",
    ", the current density will be expressed similarly to eq .  .",
    "at the same time , properties of the specific environment , determined by its electron energy spectrum , will affect the expression for the current density through coefficients similar to @xmath76 .",
    "thus , deriving equations describing the evolution of electromagnetic waves in an the cntarray , we also derive a universal approach for optimizing simulations of the wave propagation in generic media defined by the energy dependence of the conduction electrons on their quasimomenta .",
    "given that the equations for the current density and vector potential have been derived , one can select a numerical scheme for solving the corresponding system of equations , this scheme remaining effective for other environments .",
    "of course , a particular medium comes with a specific electron - energy spectrum , thus leading to different values of coefficients similar to those in eq .  , which determine the fourier decomposition of the spectrum .",
    "nonetheless , the actual form of the governing equation [ similar to eqs .   and  ] , and the type of the numerical scheme remain the same .",
    "there is another approach to the visualization of the pulse evolution , which can be combined with the one proposed above .",
    "intensity @xmath74 given by eq .",
    "yields the distribution of the electric - field energy of the pulse at a fixed instant of time .",
    "however , neither the distribution of the electric field , nor the distribution of the field s energy density at a given moment of time determine the direction of motion of electromagnetic pulses .",
    "in other words , when plotting the distribution @xmath77 at a particular moment of time , one can not directly know in what direction the electromagnetic waves propagate , without having at least one similar plot at another moment of time . however , there is a method for identifying the propagation direction of the electromagnetic pulse at time @xmath78 without calculating the distribution of @xmath79 at time @xmath80 .",
    "namely , one can supplement @xmath74 at time @xmath78 by poynting vector @xmath81  @xcite ( see appendix c ) .",
    "the absolute value of the poynting vector determines the magnitude of power flux carried by the field at each point of the cnt  array at any instant of time .",
    "the direction of the power transfer is determined by the sign and magnitude of components of @xmath82 ; @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , respectively . to explain this possibility , we resort to the simple example of the wave propagating along the @xmath18 axis .",
    "the propagation of the electromagnetic pulse in the positive direction of @xmath18 is associated with the transfer of energy in this direction , which implies a positive poynting - vector component @xmath89 .",
    "accordingly , the propagation in the negative direction is associated with @xmath90 .",
    "thus , quantities @xmath91 and @xmath92 complement each other in drawing the complete structure of the electromagnetic field at any given moment : @xmath77 determines the spatial localization of the electromagnetic field ( i.e. , the state of the system at time @xmath78 ) , while a particular component of the poynting vector identifies the direction and intensity of the field - energy transfer along the respective axis , making it possible to predict the state of the system at time @xmath80 .",
    "we assume that initially ( at time @xmath93 ) the electron density is uniform with value @xmath43 , while the scalar potential is zero throughout the sample .",
    "these initial conditions are similar to those used in ref .  21 : @xmath94assuming that there are two electromagnetic pulses propagating towards each other in the cnt array , we define the initial projection of the vector- potential field of the pair of pulses as follows : @xmath95 \\right\\ } ,   \\label{18}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath96 is the corresponding profile of the projection of the @xmath97-th pulse onto the @xmath98 axis at @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and @xmath101 is the dimensionless initial transverse half - width of the @xmath97-th pulse , while @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the coordinates of the pulses centers at @xmath93 . we have chosen the gaussian profile of the input , given by eq .  , in the @xmath104 plane due to its occurrence in various applications  @xcite .    to further justify the choice of the initial profile of each electromagnetic pulse in the longitudinal ( @xmath105 ) direction , we provide the following arguments relating to eq . .",
    "first , as shown by numerical calculations , coefficients @xmath106 [ see eq .",
    "] rapidly decay with the increase of @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , we keep only the terms with @xmath108 in eq .  .",
    "second , for the time being we only consider the variation of the field in the longitudinal direction , restricting ourselves to the 1d description with coordinate @xmath105 and accepting the assumption of uniformity of the field along the @xmath98 and @xmath109 axes .",
    "third , the assumption of the uniformity of the field along the @xmath98 axis allows us to neglect possible perturbation of the electron density ( i.e. , we have @xmath110 ) .",
    "it follows from here that a single scalar potential keeps a constant value throughout the sample , i.e. , @xmath111 .",
    "this conclusion also follows from eq .  , which for @xmath112 admits the trivial stationary solution , @xmath113 .",
    "as a result , we reduce eq .   to an evolution equation for the nonvanishing component of the vector potential : @xmath114where we define @xmath115 .",
    "our calculations always produce @xmath116 , hence , @xmath117 is real , with @xmath118 .",
    "equation has the form of the celebrated sine - gordon equation , which gives rise to solutions in the form of a breather , i.e. , an oscillating nontopological soliton @xcite :    @xmath119 \\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\omega ^{2}}{1-(u / v)^{2}}}\\right ) } \\right\\ } ,    \\label{20}\\ ] ]    with @xmath120 , @xmath121 being the speed of the pulse propagation , @xmath122 the linear speed of the electromagnetic waves in the medium , while @xmath123 is the coordinate of the breather s center at @xmath93 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "shares similarities with eq .  , and , in some sense , it may be treated as a non-1d inhomogeneous modified sine - gordon equation . since eq .   generates breather solutions given by eq .",
    ", one may expect a possibility for the propagation of similar solitary waves generated by eq .  .",
    "we assume that the cnt  array is irradiated by two bipolar ultra - short electromagnetic pulses propagating towards each other , so that the vector - potential field of the pair of pulses is determined by eq .",
    ", in which @xmath96 have a form similar to that in eq .",
    ": @xmath124@xmath125 \\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\omega _ { i}^{2}}{1-(u_{i}/v)^{2}}}.   \\label{23}\\end{aligned}\\]]here we use the term bipolar \" in the sense that the electromagnetic field changes its sign in the course of the pulse propagation .",
    "we emphasize that we choose the far separated initial ( at @xmath126 ) electromagnetic pulses , given  by initial conditions  , hence the interaction between them is initially negligible .",
    "it is worth stressing that the use of 1d equation   relates solely to  the choice of the longitudinal profile of the initial condition [ specifically , in the form of eq .  ] while we stay in the general framework of the 3d model .",
    "clearly , the system of governing equations , , and , with initial conditions , , , and , does not have exact analytical solutions .",
    "we have therefore conducted a numerical investigation of the interaction of the electromagnetic pulses in the cnt array . to simulate the system of governing equations , we employed an explicit finite - difference scheme previously used and detailed in refs .",
    "@xcite , which was generalized for this 3d setting .",
    "difference scheme steps in both time and space were iteratively decreased twice until the solution became unchanged in the eighth decimal place , thereby ensuring both spatial and temporal convergence of the obtained solution .",
    "thus , we have numerically found values of @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , the energy density of the electric field , defined as per eq . , and also the poynting vector .    in our simulations , we used the following realistic values of the parameters : @xmath9 , @xmath130 cm , @xmath131 ev , @xmath132 cm . the system is immersed into a medium with the relative dielectric constant @xmath133 .",

    "note also that our results are obtained in the framework of the collisionless model , which is valid at times not exceeding the above - mentioned relaxation time : @xmath143@xcite , which may be sufficient to complete the collision between the pulses .",
    "the parameters of the electromagnetic pulses , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 , were varied in a wide range , similar to what was done previously in ref .",
    "@xcite . to be specific",
    ", we here present typical results for the following initial parameters : @xmath147 , @xmath148 , which corresponds to a half - cycle pulse with vacuum wavelength @xmath149 , belonging to the long - wavelength infrared range , and @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 .",
    "note that , because of our choice of the initial conditions , the centers of the electromagnetic pulses , @xmath153 and @xmath154 , are initially located on the @xmath105 axis .",
    "figures  [ fig1][fig4 ] display results of the 3d simulations of the interaction of bipolar laser pulses in the cnt array with the parameters defined in the previous subsection .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the evolution of the energy density distribution of the electric field , @xmath155 , in the array in the course of the propagation and interaction of the pulses along the @xmath105 axis , i.e. , in the case of @xmath156 . with the value of @xmath157 chosen above",
    ", the length unit on the @xmath105 axis corresponds to a distance @xmath158 cm in physical units , hence , the coordinate interval shown in the figure , @xmath159 , corresponds to distance @xmath160 cm .",

    "we mean that the pulses pass , with a virtually undistorted shape , the distance considerably greater than their characteristic sizes along the propagation direction ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "the simulations demonstrate that , in the course of the propagation of the pulses , their longitudinal and transverse widths may change , following decrease of the peak energy density .",
    "the reduction in the peak density may be explained by their dispersive spreading in the propagation direction ( @xmath185 ) , as well as by diffractive broadening in the orthogonal directions .",
    "also , a part of the pulses energy goes into formation of ripples `` or tails '' , i.e. , emission of small - amplitude waves . nevertheless , in the entire parameter region considered in this work ,",
    "these effects remain small and do not cause destruction of the pulses .",

    "thus , each pulse , coming into the spatial region already visited by the other one , experiences an impact from the perturbations left by the second pulse .",
    "in other words , the evolution of the electromagnetic field of the pulse is _ indirectly _ affected by the presence of the counterpropagating one , which leads to the _ indirect _ interaction between the pulses through the perturbations induced by them in the electronic subsystem of the cnt array .",

    "our modeling framework takes into account the perturbation of the electron density by the nonuniformity of the field along the cnt axis . * the mechanism of the indirect interaction of extremely short electromagnetic pulses via the overlapping perturbations of the electron subsystem in the cnt array was thoroughly studied by using the visualization of two complementary quantities : the distribution of the energy density of the electric field , as a characteristic of the field localization , and components of the poynting vector , as a characteristic of the propagation direction and energy flux .",
    "* the numerical model used in this work allows the investigation of different scenarios of the interaction of bipolar electromagnetic pulses in the cnt arrays .",
    "it has been established that the pulses separate after the collision , restoring their shape and steadily moving over distances much greater than their characteristic sizes . *",
