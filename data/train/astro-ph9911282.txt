    "the discovery of what appear to be sne dominating the light curves and spectral flux distributions ( sfds ) of the afterglows of grb 980326 ( bloom et al .",
    "1999 ) and grb 970228 ( reichart 1999 ; galama et al .",
    "1999 ) at late times after these bursts strongly suggests that at least some , and perhaps all , of the long bursts are related to the deaths of massive stars . here ,",
    "we build upon the results of reichart ( 1999 ) by modeling the sfd of the host galaxy of grb 970228 , fitting this model to measurements of the host galaxy , and using the fitted model to better subtract out the contribution of the host galaxy to measurements of the afterglow of this burst .",
    "in figure 1 , we plot the observed sfd of the host galaxy of grb 970228 , as measured with _ hst_/wfpc2 , _ hst_/nicmos2 , and keck i ( castander & lamb 1999a ; fruchter et al . 1999 ) . to these measurements and a broadband measurement made with _",
    "hst_/stis ( castander & lamb 1999a ; fruchter et al .",
    "1999 ) , which is not plotted , we fit a two - parameter , spectral synthesis model ( see castander & lamb 1999a for details ) .",
    "the two parameters are the normalization of the sfd , and the age of the galaxy , defined to be the length of time that star formation has been occurring at a constant rate . taking @xmath0 mag for the galactic extinction along the line of sight ( castander & lamb 1999b )",
    ", we find a fitted age of @xmath1 myr ; different values of @xmath2 affect primarily the fitted age , and not the fitted sfd .",
    "furthermore , models in which star formation slows considerably , or ceases , are generally too red to account for the measurements .",
    "finally , we note that the fitted j- and r - band spectral fluxes are perfectly consistent with what one finds simply from linear interpolation between adjacent photometric bands .",
    "in figure 2 , we plot the sfd of the afterglow minus the _ observed _ sfd of the host galaxy from figure 1 . for the sfd of the afterglow , we use the revised k- , j- , and r - band measurements of galama et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and the i- and v - band measurements of castander & lamb ( 1999a ; see also fruchter et al .",
    "1999 ) ; all of these measurements were taken between 30 and 38 days after the burst .",
    "we have scaled these measurements to a common time of 35 days after the burst , and have corrected these measurements for galactic extinction along the line of sight ( see reichart 1999 for details ) .",
    "the k - band measurement of the afterglow is consistent with that of the host galaxy ( galama et al .",
    "1999 ) , resulting in an upper limit in figure 2 ; j- and r - band measurements of the host galaxy are not available , again resulting in upper limits in figure 2 . as originally concluded by reichart ( 1999 ) , this sfd is consistent with that of sn 1998bw , after transforming it to the redshift of the burst , @xmath3 ( djorgovski et al .",
    "1999 ) , and correcting it for galactic extinction along its line of sight ( see reichart 1999 for details ) .",
    "in figure 3 , we plot the same distribution , but minus the _ modeled _ sfd of the host galaxy from figure 1 .",
    "the sn - like component to the afterglow is detected in the j band , and possibly in the r band .",
    "the j - band measurement suggests that the sn - like component is @xmath4 mag fainter , and @xmath4 of a photometric band bluer , than sn 1998bw ; however , this difference in j - band spectral fluxes is significant only at the @xmath5 @xmath6 level . when possible photometric zero point errors and uncertainties in our spectral synthesis model of the sfd of the host galaxy are included , this difference is significant only at the @xmath7 @xmath6 level .",
    "however , it is suggestive of what is generally expected : the type ic sne that are theorized to be associated with bursts ( e.g. , woosley 1993 ) are not expected to be standard candles .",
