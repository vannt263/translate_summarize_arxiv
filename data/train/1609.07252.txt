    "comets are among the most pristine objects of the solar system . the chemical composition of nucleus ices should provide insights for the conditions of formation and evolution of the early solar system .",
    "a large numbers of molecules have now been identified in cometary atmospheres , both from ground - based observations and space , including in situ investigations of cometary atmospheres @xcite .",
    "molecular abundances relative to water present strong variations from comet to comet , and also vary along comet orbit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this chemical diversity is often interpreted as reflecting different formation conditions in the primitive solar nebula ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , questions arise concerning the extent to which abundances measured in cometary atmospheres are representative of the pristine composition of nucleus ices .",
    "models investigating the thermal evolution and outgassing of cometary nuclei show that the outgassing profiles of cometary molecules depend on numerous factors such as molecule volatility , thermal inertia of the nucleus material , nature of water ice structure , and dust mantling @xcite .",
    "the study of the development of cometary activity , with the goal to relate coma and nucleus chemical properties , is one of the main objectives of the rosetta mission of the european space agency @xcite .",
    "rosetta reached comet 67p / churyumov - gerasimenko ( hereafter referred to as 67p ) in august 2014 at @xmath3 = 3.5 au from the sun , and accompanied it in its journey towards perihelion ( 13 august 2015 , @xmath3 = 1.24 au ) , with the end of the mission in september 2016 .",
    "the scientific instruments on the orbiter and philae lander provided complementary information on the physical and chemical properties of the nucleus surface and subsurface , and of the inner coma .",
    "they revealed a dark , organic - rich and low - density bi - lobed nucleus with a morphologically complex surface showing different geological terrains , some of them with smooth dust - covered areas @xcite .",
    "dust jets originating from active cliffs , fractures and pits were observed @xcite .",
    "water vapour was first detected in june 2014 , at 3.93 au from the sun @xcite . in data obtained pre - equinox ( may 2015 ) ,",
    "the water outgassing was found to correlate well with solar illumination , though with a large excess from the brighter and bluer hapi region situated in the northern hemisphere @xcite . in the hapi active region , virtis has observed that surficial water ice has diurnal variability showing sublimation and condensation cycle occurring with the change of illumination conditions @xcite .",
    "in contrast , co@xmath0 originated mainly from the poorly illuminated southern hemisphere @xcite , where virtis identified a co@xmath0 ice - rich area ( specifically in the anhur region * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the large obliquity ( 52@xmath4 ) of the 67p rotation axis @xcite leads to strong seasonal effects on its nucleus , with the northern regions experiencing a long summer at large distances from the sun whereas the southern polar regions are subject to a short - lived , but extremely intense summer season around perihelion . in this paper ,",
    "we present observations of h@xmath0o , co@xmath0 , @xmath1co@xmath0 , ocs , and ch@xmath2 in the vapour phase undertaken with the high spectral resolution channel of the visible infrared thermal imaging spectrometer ( virtis ) @xcite near perihelion ( early july to end of september 2015 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : section  [ sec : obs ] presents the virtis - h instrument , the data set and raster maps of h@xmath0o and co@xmath0 which provide the context for the off - limb observations studied in the paper ; in sect .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we present the detected molecular emission lines and the fluorescence models used for their analysis ; section  [ sec : results ] presents the data analysis and the column densities measured for h@xmath0o , co@xmath0 , ch@xmath2 , and ocs , and their relative abundances ; an interpretation of the results and a discussion follows in sect .  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the virtis instrument is composed of two channels : virtis - m , a spectro - imager operating both in the visible ( 0.251 @xmath5 m ) and infrared ( 15 @xmath5 m ) ranges at moderate spectral resolution ( @xmath6/@xmath7 = 70 - 380 ) , and virtis - h , a point spectrometer in the infrared ( 1.95.0 @xmath5 m ) with higher spectral resolution capabilities @xcite .",
    "the infrared channel of virtis - m stopped providing cometary data in may 2015 , due to a cryocooler failure .",
    "only virtis - h data are used in this paper .",
    "virtis - h is a cross - dispersing spectrometer consisting of a telescope , an entrance slit , followed by a collimator , and a prism separating eight orders of a grating @xcite .",
    "the spectra investigated in this paper are in orders 0 ( 4.0495.032 @xmath5 m ) and 2 ( 3.0443.774 @xmath5 m ) .",
    "each order covers 432 @xmath8 5 pixels on the detector .",
    "a `` pixel map '' locates the illuminated pixels .",
    "the field of view corresponds to a 5-pixel wide area on the focal plane array ; in nominal mode ( most data ) , the summation of the signals received on these pixels ( actually only the 3 more intense ) is performed on - board .",
    "the spectra are therefore sampled by 3456 spectral elements , 432 in each grating order . as for most rosetta instruments ,",
    "the line of sight of virtis is along the z - axis of the spacecraft ( s / c ) .",
    "the instantaneous field of view ( fov ) of the virtis - h instrument is 0.58 @xmath8 1.74 mrad@xmath9 ( the larger dimension being along the y axis ) .",
    "the virtis - h data are processed using the so - called calibros pipeline .",
    "this pipeline subtracts dark current , corrects for the instrumental function ( odd / even pixels effects , de - spiking ) , and calibrates the absolute flux of the spectra in radiance ( w / m@xmath9/sr/@xmath5 m ) .",
    "stray light is present in some spectra on the short - wavelength side of each order , depending on the location of the nucleus with respect to the slit ( fig  [ fig : fullspectrum ] ) .    the nominal numerical spectral resolving power @xmath6/@xmath10 varies between 1300 and 3500 within each order , where @xmath10 is the grating resolution .",
    "the spectral sampling interval is 1.21.3 @xmath10 , and thus above nyquist sampling . in the current calibration ,",
    "odd / even effects were overcome by performing spectral smoothing with a boxcar average over 3 spectral channels , thereby reducing the effective spectral resolution to a value @xmath11 2.7 @xmath8 @xmath10 , which was experimentally verified by fitting spectra of the h@xmath0o and co@xmath0 bands in order 4 and 0 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the effective spectral resolution with the current calibration is @xmath11 800 at 3.3 and 4.7 @xmath5 m .",
    "the geometric parameters of the observations have been computed using nucleus shape model shap5 v1.1 , derived from osiris images @xcite .      [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,<,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath12 values at @xmath3 = 3",
    "au from @xcite , except for co@xmath0 measured at 1.82.9 au @xcite .",
    "@xmath13 values at @xmath3 = 3 au from @xcite .",
    "@xmath14 values from this work at @xmath3 = 1.251.36 au .",
    "@xmath15 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "virtis was built by a consortium from italy , france and germany , under the scientific responsibility of the istituto di astrofisica e planetologia spaziali of inaf , rome ( it ) , which lead also the scientific operations .",
