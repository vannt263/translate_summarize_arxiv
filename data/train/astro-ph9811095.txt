    ", we adopted a hybrid method .",
    "namely , the fitted result was used only at radii larger than @xmath7 where the surface brightness is smooth ; but at radii less than @xmath7 the radial surface brightness profile was determined by using a series of concentric elliptical contours with fixed center position , shape and position angle equal to the corresponding mean values of the fit between radii @xmath8 to @xmath9 in the outer galaxy . note that the two latter parameters were also averaged over the b and r passbands . in this `` concentric elliptical model '' method ,",

    "was employed throughout , and the observations were calibrated using sources from the vla calibrator list .",
    "calibration and data - editing were accomplished using standard aips tasks .",
    "continuum was subtracted in the uv domain using the task uvbas , and maps were made and cleaned using imagr with zerospacing fluxes as discussed below and with robustness parameter 0 for the best compromise between spatial resolution and maximum signal - to - noise .",
    "after imaging , each data cube was corrected for the vla primary beam .",
    "we estimated zerospacing fluxes from the arecibo mapping by interpolating each spectrum between arecibo velocity channels to find intensities at the velocities of the vla channels .",
    "then we integrated over the entire spatial map at each interpolated velocity to produce the zerospacing flux estimate for each vla channel .",
    "the issue of what weight is appropriate for zerospacing fluxes in imagr does not appear to have been resolved yet , so we experimented with a wide range of weights .",
    "we found that if the weight is made too large , the synthesized beam increases in size . on the other hand , large weights",
    "would give us the best chance of recovering all the flux detected in the arecibo map .",
    "the weight we chose is the largest weight that does not increase the beamsize by more than 1% , and the resulting spectrum integrated over the vla map agrees well with the global spectrum integrated over the arecibo results .    following common practise , we have abbreviated the names so that the field `` n4532 '' is centered on the optical image of ngc@xmath04532 while `` ddo@xmath0137 '' is centered a few arcmin west of the optical image of ddo@xmath0137 in order to give maximum sensitivity to the plume extending to the west of the galaxy as seen in our arecibo mapping ( hoffman et al .",

    "the field `` n4532/d137 '' is centered in the region between the two galaxies to provide maximum sensitivity to condensations within that region of the cloud enveloping the two galaxies .",
    "we obtained data for two fields using the d array , one field centered on ngc@xmath04532 and the second nearly due s , a few arcmin w of the optical image of ddo@xmath0137 . since significant emission seems to be confined to the region of overlap in the two d array fields , we combined them as follows : each uv data set was first shifted to a common tangent point using aips task uvfix ; the sets were then combined using task dbcon .",
    "imagr was run on the combined dataset , producing maps with a @xmath20 synthesized beam , 1.6 mjy @xmath21 rms , and a @xmath19 column density limit of @xmath22atoms@xmath23 .",
    "finally , we applied a primary beam correction by averaging the standard vla primary beam corrections for each original pointing center , giving each equal weight .",
    "the result is a data cube that exhibits the same column densities near the centers of each galaxy , but which shows the diffuse emission more clearly than either of the separate fields .",
    "we similarly combined the d array and c array datasets , weighting the primary beam corrections by the number of visibilities in each data set .",
    "the result is a final set of maps with an @xmath24 synthesized beam and rms noise 0.58 mjy @xmath21 per channel , or a @xmath19 column density limit of @xmath25atoms@xmath23 . the c+d array mosaic is shown in fig .",

    "earlier attempts to merge the datasets using the maximum entropy method task vtess produced a large smear of apparently spurious emission across the center of the field ; that is why we resorted to the method described above .",
    "efforts at merging both vla datasets with our single - dish arecibo map ( hoffman et al .",
    "1993 , hereafter hls+93 ) are underway ( connell 1998 ) , but our thrust here is to consider the vla and arecibo data in parallel .",
    "in addition to emission from each of the two optical galaxies , we have clearly detected emission from three gas concentrations distinct from those galaxies ( but still embedded within the low column density envelope we found in our arecibo mapping [ hls+93 ] ) . we will call these clouds a , b and c as labeled in fig .",

    "this is equal , within the uncertainties , to the flux we attribute to ngc@xmath04532 in our arecibo mapping ( see table [ restab ] ; the fluxes reported in hls+93 for ngc@xmath04532 / ddo@xmath0137 did not properly correct for beam overlaps  please note that this error affected only the map of ngc@xmath04532 / ddo@xmath0137 , not the other maps reported in hls+93 ) .",

    "although the observed velocity field does not constrain the position angle nor inclination of the innermost rings of ngc@xmath04532 , we do obtain convergence , at values close to those determined optically , for the annulus having inner radius @xmath31 and outer radius @xmath32 .",
    "consequently we adopt those values : position angle of the receding end of the major axis @xmath33 , inclination @xmath34 , systemic velocity 2005 km @xmath26 , for all rings of the galaxy .",
    "the galaxy s center is not well determined by the optical data , due to an apparent very strong off - center starburst , and the outer portions of the distribution and its velocity field are evidently perturbed by tidal interactions within the system .",
    "the central part of the galaxy s velocity field should be least affected by external influences , so the systemic velocity was chosen to make the central part of the rotation curve symmetric .",

    "the second moment map indicates a rather uniform velocity dispersion within the c+d array beam , around 20 km @xmath26 over most of the map , decreasing to 10 km @xmath26 at the outskirts and with one large off - center region in which the dispersion rises above 30 km @xmath26 . since our synthesized beam is large compared to the scale on which the rotation curve rises , we expect the central part of the map to overestimate the dispersion .",
    "the dispersion is also likely to be overestimated around the outer edges of the map due to uneven blanking of the individual planes .",

    "the extreme velocities encountered within cloud a are 1927 and @xmath62km@xmath28 , at opposite ends of the cloud separated by about @xmath63kpc .",

    "the second moment map has an average velocity dispersion @xmath64km@xmath28 , an overestimate since there is a velocity gradient on a scale comparable to the beamsize . if we could assume that the cloud is in simple rotation and that our perspective is edge - on",

    "cloud c likewise does not have a well - ordered velocity field . within the cloud itself , velocities range from about 1854 to 1894 km@xmath58 , but in this case",
    "it is the high velocities which occur near the center of the cloud .",

    "a blowout toward us along the line - of - sight would account for the blue - shifted velocities of clouds a and c. however , gas is not expected to achieve escape velocity from a galaxy as massive as this ( mac low & ferrara 1998 ) , and the blowout would more likely occur perpendicular to the disk of the galaxy which we see nearly edge - on .",
    "the gas would also have to have time to collect and condense into the observed clouds , which is unlikely to happen while the starburst is still underway . in any case",

    "the masses reported in the preceding section are appropriate to observed dwarf star - forming galaxies ( salpeter & hoffman 1996 ; roberts & haynes 1994 ) , but the mass alone does not appear to be sufficient to gravitationally bind any of the three clouds if they are currently in virial equilibrium .",
    "dwarf galaxies formed from tidal debris are not expected to have significant dark matter halos ( barnes & hernquist 1992b ; elmegreen et al .",
    "the central column densities are @xmath88atoms@xmath23 for each , close to the critical column density for star formation ( kennicutt 1989 ) , but our surface brightness limits are close to the central surface brightnesses of the most extreme low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies known ( oneil et al .",
    "1997 ) , and more than @xmath89^{-2}$ ] fainter than most lsb galaxies .",
    "we can estimate the mass of the group of 5 objects ( 2 galaxies and 3 clouds ) on the assumption that the system is in virial equilibrium either by taking each of the five as a point object tracer of the gravitational potential of the group , using a standard virial estimator ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) or by measuring the velocity width of the global profile .",
    "both approaches give consistent results : a group mass in the range @xmath90 ( see table [ dynmas ] ) .",
    "this is approximately an order of magnitude larger than the sum of the dynamical masses of all the components , estimated from their rotation curves or profile widths .",
    "table [ dynmas ] also reports the total stellar mass of each luminous component , calculated from the @xmath91 magnitude with rc3 corrections for internal and galactic extinction , using the disk @xmath92 from our rotation curve fitting .",
    "the gas mass of each distinct component is also tabulated ; it is calculated from the mass ( vla measurement for each galaxy or cloud , arecibo measurement for the system as a whole ) by multiplying by a factor of @xmath39 to account for primordial helium gas .",
    "we have ignored any contribution from molecular gas . unless the virial estimates of the group mass are deceiving us by more than a factor of a few , the dynamics of the group are controlled by dark matter which lies mostly outside the objects we can see .    on a similar vein ,",
    "the total mass of the group as measured at arecibo is larger by 60% than the sum of the masses of the two galaxies as measured by the vla  in other words , the extragalactic gas amounts to 75% of the gas remaining in ngc@xmath04532 , or more than 3 times the gas remaining in ddo@xmath0137 ; and 28% of the total lies outside all of the galaxies and discrete gas concentrations .",
    "furthermore , as we noted in hls+93 , the bulk of the extragalactic gas  clouds a and c along with the southwestern part of the plume stretching out from ddo@xmath0137 and the diffuse material extending both e and w from ngc@xmath04532 , visible in the arecibo map but only hinted at in the vla maps presented here  falls at lower velocity than either of the two galaxies .",
    "only cloud b lies at the velocity of ngc@xmath04532 , below that of ddo@xmath0137 to which it is apparently connected . yet",
    "these features are spread out in all directions around the two galaxies .",
    "any one of these features appearing at lower velocity than its associated galaxy would not be surprising ; a tidal stream which achieved escape velocity mainly along the line - of - sight would appear blueshifted .",
    "but it would be highly improbable for the aggregate  one plume , two discrete clouds and a large quantity of diffuse gas  _ all _ to be blueshifted if they were produced by tides acting between the two galaxies . nor",
    "is it likely that any tidal scenario can account for such a large fraction of the gas having been removed from the galaxies .",
    "sancisi ( 1998 ) has suggested that , when a disk galaxy shows signs of recent interaction but has no companion galaxy of sufficient size visible today , a companion may have been present before the interaction but has now dispersed ( or has been incorporated into the larger disk ) .",
    "hunter et al .",
    "( 1998 ) make a similar suggestion for ngc@xmath04449 . because of the large quantity of very extended gas present in our system , we are instead led to speculate that the supposed tidal features are the result of the interaction between one large sm galaxy ( ngc@xmath04532 ) and a large cloud resembling @xmath01225 + 01 ( giovanelli et al .",
    "1991 ) , each with a large complement of dark matter ( or perhaps in a common halo of dark matter ) .",
    "the dark matter haloes are now overlapping , with the more diffuse cloud having been disrupted in the process ; star formation has proceeded only in the most dense clump ( ddo@xmath0137 ) of the fragmented cloud .",
    "a star formation history analysis of ccd imaging in ubvri and h@xmath1 is underway ( lhs98 ) . clouds a , b and c",
    "may either be manifestations of the tidal interaction between the original cloud and the clumpy dark matter potential , or the result of gas falling into dense clumps of dark matter within the common halo .",
    "high resolution simulations show that such clumps can survive for significant times within group - scale halos , if their internal densities are sufficiently high ( klypin et al . 1997 ; tormen et al .",
    "1997a , b ; ghigna et al .",
    "neutral hydrogen synthesis array mapping of the extended gas cloud around the widely separated galaxy pair ngc@xmath04532 / ddo@xmath0137 reveals three concentrations well separated from the two main galaxies .",
    "the masses and indicative gravitational masses are consistent with those of faint i m galaxies in the virgo cluster ( hoffman et al . 1987 ) .",
    "no stars are visible within these clouds on the ccd images of lu ( 1998 ) . the inferred dynamical mass of each cloud , assuming virial equilibrium , exceeds the mass by factors of 4 - 20 .",
    "the central column density of each cloud is close to the critical column density for star formation ( kennicutt 1989 ) , but our upper limits on surface brightness are comparable to the central surface brightnesses of the most extreme low surface brightness galaxies known ( oneil et al .",
    "1997 ) .    the distribution and rotation curve of ngc@xmath04532 display some peculiarities consistent with tidal interaction ; those of ddo@xmath0137 are more nearly in accord with expectations for a low mass irregular galaxy .",
    "a maximum disk hypothesis applied to fitting exponential star+gas disks to the observed rotation curves would require very different mass - to - light ratios for the stars in ngc@xmath04532 and those in ddo@xmath0137 , perhaps consistent with their very different apparent star formation activities ( lu et al .",
    "the shapes of the rotation curves of ddo@xmath0137 and of the approaching side of ngc@xmath04532 are consistent with a constant ratio of dark matter to star+gas density at all observed radii in each ; however , if the receding side of ngc@xmath04532 is the one less severely afflicted with non - circular velocities ( as suggested by all other indications of tidal interaction in the galaxy ) , then the usual dark matter halo is required .",
    "all available estimators of the total mass of the group ( consisting of two galaxies plus three extragalactic clouds ) give a total mass an order of magnitude larger than the sum of the masses of the individual objects out to the largest radii measured in the vla maps , as estimated from their rotation curves or virial analyses .",
    "the fluxes reported in hoffman et al .",
    "( 1993 ) for ngc@xmath04532 and ddo@xmath0137 were not properly corrected for beam overlaps ; we give the corrected fluxes in table [ restab ] .",
    "( the error affected only ngc@xmath04532 / ddo@xmath0137 , not the other galaxies discussed in that earlier paper . ) after correction , the total flux at arecibo still exceeds the sum of the masses of the two galaxies as measured in the vla mapping by 37% , and it exceeds the sum of masses of all discrete components ( including clouds a , b , and c ) by 28% . these facts , along with the kinematic peculiarities of the system , lead us to advance the hypothesis that the system progenitor was a bound pair consisting of the large sm galaxy ngc@xmath04532 and a large star - poor gas cloud similar to @xmath01225 + 01 , each dominated by dark matter .",
    "the dark matter halos have now merged , and gas is being accreted into the densest clumps within the common dark matter halo .",
