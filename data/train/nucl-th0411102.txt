    "recent experiments to explore the weak interactions between hadrons through parity nonconserving ( pnc ) observables in nuclear systems @xcite or reactions @xcite have triggered revived interests in this field .",
    "these pnc observables can be related to the meson - nucleon weak coupling constants which are introduced in the meson - exchange potential description of the hadronic weak interaction @xcite . however , due to various uncertainties ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) , the weak coupling constants were fixed only within certain ranges @xcite .",
    "thus , it has been hoped that the pnc observables from various experiments can reduce the range of these coupling constants and eventually determine the values .",
    "the situation , however , has not been much improved even by the recent measurements .",
    "for example , the value of the @xmath3 weak coupling constant , @xmath4 , from the anapole moment of @xmath5cs @xcite is inconsistent with a previous value obtained from the forbidden @xmath6-decay of @xmath7f @xcite : @xmath4 determined by the former is larger than that from the latter by a factor of 7 .",
    "new experiments , already completed @xcite , being done @xcite or expected to be performed , concern two - nucleon systems in which many body effects are absent .",
    "thus they are expected to give more stringent constraints on the weak coupling constants . for the current status of research on the weak coupling constants ,",
    "see @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we calculate the photon asymmetry @xmath2 in the radiative capture of a polarized neutron on a proton , @xmath8 , and the circular polarization of photons @xmath1 in @xmath9 at the threshold .",
    "the latest experimental value of @xmath2 is @xmath10 @xcite , but the experiment being done at lansce aims at the accuracy of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations of @xmath2 using strong models made in the 1960 s and the 1970 s such as hamada - johnston , reid - soft - core and tourreil - sprung show results similar to each other ; @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 is predominantly determined by @xmath4 and depends very little on other coupling constants ( as will be shown in table  [ tab : result ] ) . in this work we present @xmath2 calculated with potentials such as paris @xcite , bonn @xcite , bonn - a and bonn - b @xcite , and argonne @xmath0 ( a@xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "we compare our results with previous ones @xcite and investigate the model dependence of @xmath2 .",
    "contrary to @xmath2 , @xmath1 at the threshold is known to be sensitive to the heavy meson ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) components of the weak potentials @xcite .",
    "the most recent experimental value of @xmath1 is @xmath15 @xcite , and theoretical calculations made in the 1970 s agree with this value within the experimental errors .",
    "however , since @xmath1 is sensitive to the short range properties of the strong interactions as well as of the weak interactions , its model dependence is more noticeable than @xmath2 @xcite . since the inverse process",
    ", @xmath16 , whose pnc asymmetry at the threshold is equal to @xmath1 , becomes experimentally feasible nowadays , we expect that @xmath1 can be measured more precisely and can provide more constraints on the weak dynamics of hadrons .",
    "we thus investigate the model dependence of @xmath1 with the same potentials that we use in calculating @xmath2 .    in sect .",
    "2 , we present the desplanques - donaghue - holstein ( ddh ) potential @xcite and the parity - admixed wave functions in the initial and the final states . in sect .",
    "3 , the electromagnetic operators are presented , matrix elements are derived , and the results for @xmath2 and @xmath1 are shown .",

    "@xcite a transformation useful for treating the momentum dependent term is suggested . in this work , however , we have dealt with the momentum dependent terms without using such a transformation and have solved the schrdinger equation as it is .",
    "we have confirmed that the solutions thus obtained reproduce the results of each potential model @xcite fairly well with differences less than 1% .",

    "( @xmath88 , though not shown here , is more or less the same for all potential models . ) the reason for this difference can be traced back to the fact that the paris potential was fitted to proton - proton data and therefore yields a scattering length of @xmath89 fm for the @xmath32 channel ( in the absence of the coulomb interaction ) while a@xmath0 and bonn are neutron - proton models and yield @xmath90 fm . the m1 isovector amplitude @xmath60 in the denominator of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : agamma ] ) and ( [ eq : pgamma ] ) is 0.184 for paris potential and 0.233 for a@xmath0 and bonn potentials . since the wave functions that contribute to the e1 amplitude in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : e3p1s ] ) and ( [ eq : e3p1d ] ) ( numerator of @xmath2 ) are very similar , the difference in the values of @xmath2 comes mostly from the value of the m1 amplitude in the denominator of @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , the ratio of the m1 amplitudes for a@xmath0 to paris , 1.27 , is equal to the ratio of the best value of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , if one could readjust the paris potential to produce the accepted @xmath91 scattering length in the @xmath32 channel , the four models would give us essentially model - independent @xmath2 values .",

    "most of the contribution to the source terms of @xmath48 comes from the intermediate and short range region , and they depend strongly on the model . a larger source combined with attraction in the short - range region , as it is the case for the @xmath102 channel of the bonn models , yields an enhanced contribution to @xmath1 .    concluding , we have calculated parity non - conserving observables @xmath1 for the reaction @xmath112 and @xmath2 for the reaction @xmath8 at threshold . we have employed the paris , bonn and a@xmath0 potentials for the strong interaction and the ddh potential for the weak interaction .",
    "@xmath2 turns out to be independent of the strong interaction models , while @xmath1 is sensitive to the dynamics at short ranges .",
    "since @xmath2 is rather strong - interaction independent , one can reduce the uncertainty in the value of @xmath4 by measuring @xmath2 accurately . regarding @xmath1",
    ", there are relatively large uncertainties , which stem from ambiguities in both strong and weak interactions at short ranges . however , since the major uncertainty comes from the @xmath38 channel and the value of @xmath98 , an accurate experimental measurement of @xmath1 can shed some light on the weak coupling constants .",
