    "turbulence plays a crucial role in a wide variety of geophysical and astrophysical fluid flows . in this paper we present results on a particular type of plasma turbulence",
    "in which the flow is entirely due to the electrons , with the ions forming a static background .",
    "the equation governing the electrons self - induced magnetic field is then @xmath2   + r_b^{-1 } \\",
    "\\nabla^2 { \\bf b } , \\label{eq : a}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the conductivity , @xmath6 a measure of the field strength , @xmath7 the electron number density , @xmath8 the electron charge , and @xmath9 the speed of light .",
    "see for example @xcite , who derived this equation in the context of magnetic fields in the crusts of neutron stars . more generally though , it is applicable in many weakly collisional , strongly magnetic plasmas , so other applications could include the sun s corona or the earth s magnetosphere .",
    "turbulence governed by ( [ eq : a ] ) is known as electron mhd ( emhd ) , hall mhd , or whistler turbulence . based on its ( at least superficial ) similarity to the vorticity equation governing ordinary , nonmagnetic turbulence , @xmath10   + re^{-1 } \\",
    "\\nabla^2 { \\bf w } , \\label{eq : b}\\ ] ] where now @xmath11 , @xcite argued that ( [ eq : a ] ) would initiate a turbulent cascade to small lengthscales , thereby accelerating neutron stars magnetic field decay beyond what ohmic decay acting on large lengthscales could achieve .",
    "they suggested in particular that the turbulent spectrum would scale as @xmath12 , with a dissipative cutoff occurring at @xmath13 .",
    "however , there are also some quite fundamental differences between equations ( [ eq : a ] ) and ( [ eq : b ] ) . in ( [ eq : b ] ) the dissipative term contains more derivatives than the nonlinear term , so on sufficiently short lengthscales the dissipative term will always dominate .",
    "in contrast , in ( [ eq : a ] ) the two terms both contain two derivatives , so it is conceivable that the nonlinear term will always dominate , even on arbitrarily short lengthscales . as pointed out by @xcite , one obtains a dissipative cutoff only if one assumes that the cascade is local in fourier space , coupling wavenumbers only to their immediate neighbors .",
    "indeed , whether the coupling is local or not is another important difference between ( [ eq : a ] ) and ( [ eq : b ] ) . in ( [ eq : b ] ) it is at least predominantly local ; for example , very small scale structures see the largest structures as an essentially uniform background flow that simply advects them along , but without altering the nature of the small scale turbulence .",
    "in contrast , in ( [ eq : a ] ) there is no such translational invariance ; adding even an exactly uniform background field alters the dynamics of the small scale structures ( as we will show in detail below ) .",
    "similarly , in classical mhd turbulence , adding a background flow has no essential effect , but adding a background field does .",
    "in this paper we present high - resolution numerical simulations of ( [ eq : a ] ) in a two - dimensional periodic box geometry , designed specifically to address such questions as whether there is a dissipative cutoff or not , and whether the coupling is local or not .",
    "in contrast to previous simulations @xcite , we do not employ hyperdiffusivity , which would of course disrupt this feature that the two terms in ( [ eq : a ] ) have the same number of derivatives , and hence introduce an artificial dissipative cutoff .",
    "we also consider the question of whether ( [ eq : a ] ) is capable of yielding an inverse cascade , and find that magnetic energy can be at least partially transferred from small to large scales .",
    "for two - dimensional fields , we may decompose @xmath14 as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 depend only on @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , but not @xmath21 . equation ( [ eq : a ] ) then yields @xmath22 and @xmath23 where subscripts indicate derivatives .",
    "continuing our comparison of equations ( [ eq : a ] ) and ( [ eq : b ] ) , it is instructive to note also that in ( [ eq : b ] ) we would only have @xmath24 , yielding @xmath25 . \\label{psi}\\ ] ]    any additional @xmath26 would simply be advected by @xmath27 as a passive scalar , but without any influence back on @xmath27 .",
    "this difference between ( [ tp2 ] ) and ( [ tp3 ] ) on the one hand , and ( [ psi ] ) on the other merely reflects once again some of the differences between ( [ eq : a ] ) and ( [ eq : b ] ) , in this case the lack of translational invariance in ( [ eq : a ] )",
    ".    we solve ( [ tp2 ] ) and ( [ tp3 ] ) by expanding @xmath16 and @xmath17 in fourier series in @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and using standard pseudospectral techniques for the evaluation of the nonlinear terms , with dealiasing according to the 2/3 rule .",
    "the code employs the fftw library @xcite to achieve massive parallelisation on a suitable supercomputer .",
    "the time integration is done using a second order runge - kutta method .",
    "we performed a variety of runs , typically employing 64 processors , with the highest extending to @xmath28 in fourier space , corresponding to @xmath29 collocation points in real configuration space . because of the two derivatives in the nonlinear term , the required timesteps are unfortunately very small , roughly proportional to @xmath30 .",
    "values as small as @xmath31 were used , requiring @xmath32 timesteps in total to reach @xmath33 .",
    "since we are interested in freely decaying rather than forced turbulence , we need to carefully consider the nature of our chosen initial conditions .",
    "we will present results for three different sets of runs .",
    "first , to study homogeneous forward cascades , we start off with random @xmath34 energies in all fourier modes up to @xmath35 , making sure that the poloidal @xmath16 and toroidal @xmath17 components have comparable amounts of energy .",
    "after initialisation the overall amplitude of the field is rescaled to ensure that the rms value of @xmath36 at @xmath37 .",
    "second , to study nonhomogeneous forward cascades , we start off with the same initialisation as above , but now add a uniform field @xmath38 , where @xmath39 , 2 or 4 . note",
    "though that such a uniform field can not be represented by an expansion of the form ( [ tp1 ] ) , at least not if @xmath16 and @xmath17 are to be periodic in @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "instead , this field is simply added in to ( [ tp1 ] ) directly , resulting in suitably modified equations ( [ tp2 ] ) and ( [ tp3 ] ) .",
    "third , to explore the possibility of inverse cascades , we return to the @xmath40 case without any large scale magnetic field and now inject energy into modes in the range @xmath41 .",
    "the question then is how much of this initial energy moves to @xmath42 , and how much moves to @xmath43 .",
    "finally , for all three sets of results , each individual run was repeated with a number of different random initial conditions , to ensure that the results presented here are indeed representative .",
    "equations ( [ tp2 ] ) and ( [ tp3 ] ) also have some useful associated diagnostics , corresponding to quantities that are conserved in the ideal , @xmath44 , limit .",
    "specifically , we have equations for the energy and the magnetic helicity , @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the vector potential , defined by @xmath48 .",
    "note though that in the presence of a uniform background field , helicity is not even defined @xcite , let alone conserved .",
    "these two equations are valid in both 2 and 3 dimensions . in 2 dimensions",
    "only , we have the additional quantity of the mean squared magnetic potential , known as anastrophy @xmath49 which is in some ways perhaps analogous to enstrophy , which is also defined only for ( [ psi ] ) in 2d , but not for ( [ eq : b ] ) in 3d . however , anastrophy is _ not _ the same as enstrophy , and there does not appear to be any reason why conservation of anastrophy would necessarily imply an inverse cascade in the way that conservation of enstrophy forces inverse cascades to exist in 2d hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "in addition to the physical insight that they yield into the nature of the hall nonlinearity , these various integrated quantities also offer useful diagnostic checks of the code .",
    "reassuringly , we found that all of them ( except helicity in a uniform field of course ) were satisfied to within 0.1% or better by all of our runs .",
    "the energy spectrum , @xmath50 , of 3d hydrodynamic turbulence is characterised by @xmath51 , the familiar kolmogorov law @xcite . in 2d , the conservation of enstrophy forces an inverse cascade which leads to a much steeper spectrum @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "in the case of 2d mhd turbulence , the spectral energy transfer rate is reduced which leads to a flatter energy spectrum @xmath54 , the iroshnikov - kraichnan spectrum @xcite .",
    "recent studies of emhd turbulence have found , via methods which all employ hyperdiffusivity , a 5/3 kolmogorov spectrum for small scales @xmath55 , equivalent to @xmath56 , and a steeper 7/3 spectrum for longer wavelengths @xcite .    in the upper plot of figure [ cascades ] , we show the poloidal and toroidal energy spectra of our solutions for @xmath57 , 30 , 100 , 300 , 1000 & 3000 , evolved to a time @xmath58 .",
    "the energy spectra have been stationary since approximately @xmath59 and time averaging between 0.12 and 0.2 reveals an identical spectrum and no further information .",
    "we interpret this to mean our simulations are resolved and evolved to a suitable time for inspection of the quasi - stationary cascade .",
    "both poloidal and toroidal energy spectra start out much the same at low @xmath60 and then lower @xmath1 spectra smoothly drop off with increasing @xmath60 whilst higher @xmath1 spectra maintain a linear gradient in the log - log plot .",
    "transfer of energy to higher @xmath60 is then more efficient at higher @xmath60 .",
    "the spectra are asymptotically approaching an energy spectrum @xmath61 , where @xmath62 . in the lower plot of figure [ cascades ]",
    ", we show compensated energy spectra to show this approach to @xmath63 with increasing @xmath1 . our value of @xmath64 is not compatible with @xmath65 predicted by @xcite for 3d emhd turbulence .",
    "their prediction was calculated using a phenomenology based on kraichnan s arguments ( the whistler effect ) which has been shown by @xcite to have little effect on the energy spectrum of 2d emhd , rather it is thought to influence the subtle properties of the cascade like anisotropy which we discuss further in the next section .",
    "the spectral index we find is much more compatible with @xmath66 found by @xcite via numerical simulation for the @xmath55 regime .",
    "none of the spectra show any sign of a dissipative cutoff . by definition ,",
    "the dissipation scale should occur when the local value of @xmath1 is @xmath34 in equation [ eq : a ] .",
    "it is unclear though when this occurs since the definition of @xmath1 does not involve length scales .",
    "if the coupling is purely local in wavenumber , then this definition does involve length scales after all , since the @xmath6 that should be used is the field at that wavenumber only , rather than the total field .",
    "that is , according to the definition of @xcite where this argument was first developed , we have @xmath67 where the primed quantities are the small - scale local values and the unprimed the large - scale global . if we now suppose a @xmath0 energy spectrum , then @xmath68 and so @xmath69 is reduced to @xmath34 when @xmath70",
    "so , at @xmath71 we would see a dissipative cutoff at @xmath72 .",
    "we do not see a dissipative cutoff at this scale .",
    "we can reconcile this by realising that this argument crucially depends on the coupling being local in fourier space : if this does not hold then @xmath73 and there is simply no definite dissipation scale , as we find here .",
    "we conclude therefore that the nonlinear term is able to dominate at all length scales and the coupling is non - local in fourier space .",
    "this is not entirely unexpected , since both the terms in ( [ eq : a ] ) contain two derivatives , but it is in contrast to previous studies .",
    "it should be emphasized that other authors have been unable to properly address the question of a dissipative cutoff since hyperdiffusivity has masked the effect of the nonlinear term at high @xmath60 .",
    "this may also explain the discrepancy between the spectral index of 5/2 we find and previous values of 7/3 .    in fourier space",
    "then , emhd turbulence bears a strong resemblance to ordinary mhd turbulence .",
    "we would like to know if this resemblance carries over into real configuration space . in figure",
    "[ truefield ] , we show the three component fields at three times ; the initial fields at @xmath37 ( top row ) , intermediate fields at @xmath74 ( middle row ) and fully developed turbulent fields at @xmath33 ( bottom row ) . in classical and mhd turbulence , a fully developed turbulent field in real configuration space would bear no resemblance to the initial field , but here the fields are much more structured and fully developed turbulent fields strongly resemble initial fields .",
    "this appears to be a unique characteristic of decaying emhd turbulence .",
    "we would also like to address the energy decay of the field , with particular respect to any dependency of the decay rate on the value of @xmath1 . ref .",
    "@xcite in the first study of 2d emhd reported that the energy dissipation rate is independent of the value of the dissipation coefficient , represented by @xmath1 here .",
    "in contrast to this , we find that the energy decay is much slower at higher @xmath1 , as plotted in figure [ energy ] .",
    "emhd turbulence , like classical and mhd turbulence , is isotropic when allowed to freely decay . in the presence of a background flow ,",
    "classical turbulence remains isotropic since it is locally coupled in fourier space .",
    "small - scale structures are simply advected along by the large - scale flow , whether or not that has a uniform background contribution .",
    "numerical simulations of mhd turbulence have found it to be strongly anisotropic in the presence of a background field @xcite .",
    "this has been attributed to the excitation of alfv ' en waves which preferentially propagate parallel to the external magnetic field and hinder the cascade process perpendicular to the external field .    in emhd turbulence , recent numerical studies employing hyperdiffusivity @xcite have revealed similar strongly anisotropic behaviour .",
    "this can only be the result of asymmetry in the nonlinear spectral transfer process relative to the external magnetic field . in the context of local energy coupling in fourier",
    "space , mediation by whistler waves has been proposed as the only way this asymmetry could be achieved @xcite with the method detailed in ref .",
    "the spectrum of 2d anisotropic emhd turbulence has also been shown to exhibit a linear relationship with an external magnetic field @xcite .    in order to understand how hyperdiffusivity has affected previous studies",
    "we have introduced a background field into the governing equations as discussed above and calculated solutions for @xmath75 & 300 at a spatial resolution of @xmath76 points in real configuration space .",
    "we present our results in figure [ background1 ] . across the top row",
    ", we show 2d energy spectra for @xmath75 with @xmath40 , 1 , 2 & 4 . in the isotropic case with no background field , i.e. @xmath40",
    ", energy is evenly distributed between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , as indicated by circular contours . in the case of @xmath39",
    "we find energy transfer to larger @xmath60 has been suppressed in the @xmath18 direction , parallel to the background field .",
    "emhd turbulence has become anisotropic in the presence of a uniform background field with normal diffusivity .",
    "the effect becomes more pronounced for @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the evolution of modes parallel and perpendicular to the field is clearly different , as the spectral cascade in the parallel wavenumbers is clearly suppressed .",
    "this suppression has been attributed to excitation of whistler waves , which act to weaken spectral transfer along the direction of propagation @xcite . across the bottom row , we show the corresponding @xmath79 fields . for @xmath40 ,",
    "the field is isotropic , but as the value of @xmath80 is increased , structures are stretched in the @xmath18 direction corresponding to increasingly inhibited energy transfer in @xmath18 but not in @xmath19 , perpendicular to the field direction .",
    "this result is in agreement with @xcite who found scale - dependent anisotropy in numerical studies of 3d emhd turbulence employing hyperdiffusivity .",
    "our simulations also support the linear relationship between 2d emhd turbulence and strength of external magnetic field found by @xcite . at @xmath81",
    "we reassuringly find the field is more anisotropic .",
    "it is worth noting here that since ( [ eq : a ] ) is scale invariant - we can apply the equation over the whole of a system , or just a small section , with @xmath1 unchanged - if you take a very small box , then this box will see the large - scale field as a background field , and therefore one would expect the smallest scales in the system , for example a neutron star , to be anisotropic .      in classical turbulence ,",
    "the exchange of energy and enstrophy @xmath82 is coupled in fourier space according to @xmath83 hence energy injected at intermediate scales experiences a transfer to both higher and lower wavenumbers in order to satisfy this coupling and simultaneously conserve energy and enstrophy .",
    "this is the inverse cascade of energy to lower @xmath60 ( larger scales ) @xcite . in mhd turbulence ,",
    "energy and magnetic helicity are coupled in the same way and an inverse cascade occurs in order to simultaneously conserve these two quadratic ideal invariants . to investigate whether an inverse cascade occurs in decaying emhd turbulence",
    ", we inject energy over the wavenumber range @xmath84 as detailed above and evolve the magnetic field .    in figure [ inverse ]",
    "we show the solution for @xmath71 at various times .",
    "to fully resolve the solution in a reasonable amount of computational time we have chosen to evolve the field to @xmath33 at a resolution of @xmath85 real space points , then to @xmath86 with @xmath87 points and finally to @xmath88 with @xmath76 points .",
    "for this reason the energy spectra have different extents in fourier space at the different times @xmath89 ( dashed line ) , 0.1 , 1.0 , 3.0 , 6.0 , & 15.0 .",
    "we include the full information , rather than just cutting off the plot at @xmath90 , to demonstrate that our solutions are indeed fully resolved . the spectra show that energy is clearly transferred to @xmath42 in an inverse cascade , with the spectral peak shifting to @xmath91 but not maintaining the same amplitude .",
    "some energy has also transferred to @xmath43 resulting in an overall spectrum comparable to a forward homogeneous cascade at late time . at @xmath74",
    "the spectrum has a spectral index of -5/2 for @xmath92 . at late time",
    "this has steepened to @xmath93 . between @xmath94 and @xmath95 ,",
    "the spectral index has stabilised .",
    "the inverse cascade phenomenon becomes less pronounced at lower values of @xmath1 with no inverse cascade at all below @xmath81 .    in figure [ invfield ]",
    "we show the evolution of the field by including the real configuration space fields at times @xmath74 , 3.0 and 15.0 .",
    "the initial field containing intermediate scale structure can be seen to develop large scale structures , which unlike ordinary or mhd turbulence again appear to be relatively stationary .",
    "previous work has considered inverse cascade action in driven , rather than decaying , 2d emhd turbulence @xcite . there",
    "the authors found a forward cascade of energy and an inverse cascade of mean squared magnetic potential or anastrophy . between the forcing lengthscale and the artificial dissipative cutoff",
    ", the authors found a @xmath96 energy spectrum consistent with our results at @xmath74 .",
    "it remains unclear though why the spectrum steepens at late time .",
    "previous work @xcite has found a tendency toward energy condensation in forced 2d classical turbulence .",
    "there the condensation is a finite size effect of the biperiodic box which occurs after the standard inverse cascade reaches the size of the system .",
    "it leads to the emergence of a coherent vortex dipole .",
    "it is important to note that the dipole contains most of the injected energy and since we are simulating decaying emhd turbulence , we do not inject any energy which could power the emergence of such a structure .",
    "the real field in figure [ invfield ] shows no evidence of collimated dipole structure and in fact a large number of isolated vortices can be seen , a characteristic of fluid turbulence noted in @xcite . here",
    "then we deduce we are seeing the first direct demonstration of the dual cascade phenomenon in decaying 2d emhd turbulence .",
    "we have investigated the nature of decaying 2d emhd turbulence with normal diffusivity and compared it with classical and mhd turbulence and studies of 2d emhd with hyperdiffusivity .",
    "we have found emhd turbulence experiences an isotropic forward cascade of energy to higher wavenumber ( smaller spatial scales ) asymptotically approaching @xmath97 with increasing @xmath1 ( inversely proportional to a dissipation coefficient ) , in broad agreement with previous studies .",
    "we have found there is no dissipative cutoff at the predicted wavenumber @xmath70 and argue this is consistent with non - local coupling in fourier space , the most important result of this paper .",
    "hyperdiffusivity has previously clouded this issue and introduced an artificial cutoff . only now , when we can avoid its use , has the true nature become clear .",
    "we have also found that fully developed emhd turbulence appears to be strongly structured , retaining a similarity to the initial field at late time , very much unlike classical or mhd turbulence and a point not noted in previous literature .",
    "our study of emhd turbulence with normal diffusivity has been found to display scale - dependent anisotropy in the presence of a uniform background field , in good agreement with previous studies employing hyperdiffusivity .",
    "further , our results support previous studies which found the strength of the anisotropy is linearly related to the external field strength .",
    "finally , we have discovered that decaying emhd turbulence is capable of yielding an inverse cascade , at least partially transferring magnetic energy from intermediate to large lengthscales .",
    "this result may be particularly significant for the magnetic fields of neutron stars , where the proto - neutron star that emerges from a supernova explosion may well have a primarily small - scale , disordered field . a hall - induced inverse cascade",
    "may then be a mechanism whereby it acquires a large - scale , ordered field .",
