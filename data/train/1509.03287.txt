    "the unprecedented adoption of mobile handhelds has created a host of new services that require accurate localization , even in gps - denied environments .",
    "how to accurately localize without satellite positioning has been an active research topic .",
    "various cooperative localization methods have been developed suitable to high noise scenarios , e.g. , indoors @xcite .",
    "the motivation behind this work is the assumption in the literature of distributed cooperative localization that requires a universally known _ global coordinate system ( gcs)_. even in anchor - free algorithms , such as those in @xcite , where nodes localize to a relative _ local coordinate system ( lcs ) _ only , the anchors with shared gcs knowledge are required to transform the local coordinates to global ones .",
    "otherwise , nodes would have no idea the whereabout of the global origin .",
    "in the case of distributed ad - hoc networks , where the anchors are simply nodes with a good estimate of their gps coordinates , achieving a shared gcs between them is non - trivial .",
    "presumably , in this case , the anchors would have to communicate with each other to agree on a gcs with a common origin and pass that information to the rest of the network nodes .",
    "in addition , up - to - date information between nodes should be maintained , inducing an increased communication overhead .",
    "the solution we suggest is to use directly a gcs for all calculations , therefore eliminating any need for lcs and all of the described issues .",
    "the first obvious choice of a gcs would be to use gps as a common gcs to all nodes .",
    "unfortunately using gps coordinates in message passing operations would easily make calculations underflow due to the small distances inherent in indoors localization , and would require scaling and normalization at each node .",
    "this means that every node would have to convert incoming messages to a lcs , suitable for message passing operations , and then convert them back to the gcs for transmission , increasing the computational cost of the algorithm .",
    "instead , we propose a grid - based gcs that can be used directly to conduct message passing operations and at the same time hugely decrease the computational cost . in this manner",
    "we both remove any requirement for the networks to consent on a gcs and also achieve very low complexity .",
    "this correspondence proposes a novel scheme that uses a gcs system suitable for message passing algorithms in cooperative localization . as a real - life example",
    ", we use the nato s military grid reference system ( mgrs ) , cf .",
    "the approach no longer requires gcs coordination between anchors .",
    "also , it has inspired the use of parametric representations using multinomial probability mass functions ( pmfs ) , allowing for a fast robust and accurate cooperative localization algorithm that elegantly resolves the gcs knowledge requirement . in summary , we have made the following contributions :    * we propose a grid - based gcs solution , i.e. , map gps coordinates to unique grid identifiers , solving the common reference issue in all distributed localization techniques .",
    "* parametric approximations to the pmfs are proposed to overcome the computational bottleneck of non - parametric belief propagation ( bp ) used in cooperative localization .",
    "* simulation results illustrate that the proposed grid - based bp method , which is referred to as grid - bp , provides similar accuracy with low computational cost when compared to common techniques with _",

    "we consider a network of nodes in a 2d environment which consists of @xmath0 agents and @xmath1 anchors , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",

    "initially , the belief for the agents can be a non - informative uniform pmf over the grid , while the anchors pmfs are focused in the ids close to the real position , e.g. , within @xmath24 . anchors can obtain their ids either by directly mapping them from satellite data , cf .",
