    "it has been recently pointed out  @xcite that the radiative corrections to the masses of the higgs bosons in the framework of the mssm  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite can be relatively large .",
    "the leading correction to the effective potential comes from the top quark and squark loops , being proportional to the top yukawa coupling , which is considered to be big due to the heaviness of the top quark .",
    "the other corrections happen to be smaller , though in some cases their effect is not negligible as well .",
    "the net effect of the radiative corrections is to increase the masses of the higgs bosons .",
    "this increase may be very significant for the future searches , since it can achieve several dozen gev , implying that the higgs mass could exceed the @xmath0 boson mass .",
    "considering the tree - level higgs potential one finds out that the value of the lightest higgs boson mass is restricted by the inequality    @xmath1    this strict limit is , however , violated by the radiative corrections .",
    "the radiative corrections to the supersymmetric boson masses proceed > from the one - loop effective potential    @xmath2    where @xmath3 denotes the conventional supertrace and @xmath4 is the scale at which all the couplings in the tree - level potential are renormalized .",
    "@xmath5 are the field dependent masses of all the possible particles running through the loops . in what follows",
    "we limit ourselves with the top and stop contributions as the main ones .",
    "as far as the radiative corrections appear to be large achieving 30 % one can wonder about the values of the higher order contributions .",
    "since according to eq.([3 ] ) they have the @xmath6 form one is expecting to have @xmath7 at the second loop , @xmath8 at the third loop , etc . being essential these logs have to be summed giving considerable change of the results .",
    "indeed this happens in the simplest case of the @xmath9 model considered in the pioneering paper by coleman and weinberg  @xcite .",
    "the summation of the leading logs to the effective potential changed the situation qualitatively leading to the disappearance of a non - trivial minimum arising at the one - loop level .",
    "the summation procedure can be naturally done with the help of the renormalization group technique , which we are going to apply to our particular case .",
    "let us remind the expression for the one - loop effective higgs potential in the mssm which takes into account the radiative corrections due to the top quark and squark loops . for the neutral higgses",
    "it has been calculated in ref.@xcite and has the form    @xmath10 @xmath11-v_0 \\label{5},\\ ] ] where @xmath12 are the field dependent masses of the stop particles and @xmath13 is the field dependent top mass .",
    "the scale @xmath4 remains arbitrary and is usually chosen to be equal to the value of the top mass .",
    "in fact the potential is scale independent since explicit dependence on the scale is compensated by the implicit dependence of the parameters renormalized at this scale .",
    "@xmath14 is the value of the potential at @xmath15 , which has to be subtracted in order to keep the scale invariance  @xcite .",
    "the field dependent squarks masses are given by the eigenvalues of the mass - squared matrix    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the conventional trilinear soft supersymmetry breaking parameter , @xmath18 is the higgs mixing parameter , and the top mass squared is given by @xmath19 .",
    "the so - called d - terms give contribution proportional to the gauge couplings and will be ignored hereafter in order to gain approximate scale independence of the potential , since we are including only top - stop contributions to @xmath20 .",
    "then the eigenvalues of the matrix ( [ 6 ] ) are    @xmath21 , \\ ] ]    where @xmath22 .",
    "the scale independence of the effective potential ( [ 5 ] ) is given by the renormalization group equation    @xmath23    where @xmath24 are the parameters of the tree - level potential and @xmath25 s denote their @xmath26 functions .",
    "according to the approximation mentioned above , we have ignored the scale dependence of the gauge couplings .",
    "the general solution of eq.(7 ) has the form :    @xmath27 where the function @xmath28 is the perturbative expression with the scale chosen arbitrary , @xmath24  are the effective parameters of the potential ,    @xmath29 and @xmath30 s are anomalous dimensions of the fields @xmath31 .",
    "in particular one can choose @xmath4 to be equal to the top mass , as is usually done .",
    "however , the main distinction is whether we choose the top mass to be field dependent and put it equal to its numerical value after the minimization of the potential , or we take its numerical value at the very beginning and then minimize the potential . in the latter case",
    "we incorporate the perturbative corrections to the potential , while in the first case we sum all the leading logs via the renormalization group equation . proceeding the first way we get    @xmath32 \\nonumber,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is the field dependent mass and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the stop masses boundary values when @xmath15 .",
    "eq.[9 ] is the rg improved expression for the one - loop effective potential which corresponds to taking into account all the leading log contributions proportional to the top yukawa coupling from all the loops .",
    "to find the vacuum expectation values of the higgs fields we have to minimize the potential . using the notation    @xmath35 and keeping only the terms of the first order in coupling constants the minimum of the potential ( [ 9 ] )",
