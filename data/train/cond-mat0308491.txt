    "the seminal work by bardeen , cooper and schrieffer @xcite taken further by eliashberg @xcite to the intermediate coupling solved one of the major problems in condensed matter physics .",
    "high - temperature superconductors present a challenge to the conventional theory . while the bcs theory provides a qualitatively correct description of some novel superconductors like magnesium diborade and doped fullerenes ( if the phonon dressing of carriers , i.e. polaron formation is properly taken into account ) ,",
    "cuprates remain a problem . here strong antiferromagnetic and charge fluctuations and the frhlich and jahn - teller electron - phonon interactions have been identified as an essential piece of physics . in particular , experimental @xcite evidence for an exceptionally strong electron - phonon interaction in all high temperature superconductors is now overwhelming . our view , which we discussed in detail elsewhere @xcite is that the extension of the bcs theory towards the strong interaction between electrons and ion vibrations describes the phenomenon naturally .",
    "the high temperature superconductivity exists in the crossover region of the electron - phonon interaction strength from the bcs - like to bipolaronic superconductivity as was predicted before @xcite , and explored in greater detail after the discovery @xcite .",
    "the low energy physics in this regime is that of a charged bose gas of small bipolarons , which are real - space bosons dressed by phonons .",
    "they are itinerant quasiparticles existing in the bloch states at temperatures below the characteristic phonon frequency . here",
    "i review the bipolaron theory of the vortex state .",
    "cbg is an extreme type ii superconductor , as shown below .",

    "the integra - differential equation ( 1 ) is quite different from the ginsburg - landau @xcite and gross - pitaevskii @xcite equations , describing the vortex in the bcs and netral superfluids , respectively . while cbg shares the quantum coherence with the bcs superconductors and neutral superfluids owing to the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , the long - range ( nonlocal ) interaction leads to some peculiarities . in particular ,",
    "the vortex is charged in cbg , and the coherence length is just the same as the screening radius .    indeed , introducing dimensionless quantities @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 for the order parameter , length and magnetic field , respectively , eq.(1 ) and the maxwell equations take the following form : @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 a new feature compared with the gl equations for a single vortex @xcite is the electric field potential determined as @xmath13\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with a new fundamental unit @xmath14 .",
    "the potential is calculated using the poisson equation ( 3 ) . at @xmath15",
    "the coherence length is the same as the screening radius , @xmath16  and the london penetration depth is @xmath17 here @xmath18^{1/2}$ ] is the plasma frequency .",
    "there are now six boundary conditions in a single - vortex problem .",
    "four of them are the same as in the bcs superconductor @xcite , @xmath19 , @xmath20 for @xmath21 and the flux quantization condition , @xmath22 for @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is an integer .",
    "the remaining two conditions are derived from the global charge neutrality , @xmath25 for @xmath21 and @xmath26 for the electric field at the origin , @xmath27 we notice that the chemical potential @xmath28 is zero at any point in the thermal equilibrium .",
    "cbg is an extreme type ii superconductor with a very large ginsburg - landau parameter , @xmath29 .",
    "indeed , with the material parameters typical for oxides , such as @xmath30 , @xmath31 and the static dielectric constant @xmath32 we obtain @xmath33 nm , @xmath34 nm , and the ginsburg - landau ratio @xmath35 . owing to a large dielectric constant the coulomb repulsion remains weak even for heavy bipolarons , @xmath36 if @xmath37 eq.(4 ) is reduced to the london equation with the familiar solution @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the hankel function of imaginary argument of zero order . for the region @xmath40 , where the order parameter and the electric field differ from unity and zero , respectively , we can use the flux quantization condition to `` integrate out '' the magnetic field in eq.(2 ) . that leaves us with two parameter - free equations written for @xmath41 as @xmath42 and @xmath43 they are satisfied by regular solutions of the form @xmath44 and @xmath45 when @xmath46 .",
    "the constants @xmath47 and @xmath48 are determined by complete numerical integration of eqs.(10 ) and ( 11 ) .",
    "the numerical results for @xmath49 are @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "in the region @xmath52 the solutions are @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in this region @xmath55",
    "differs qualitatively from the bcs order parameter , @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the difference is due to a local charge redistribution caused by the magnetic field in cbg . quite different from the bcs superconductor , where the total density of electrons remains constant across the sample",
    ", cbg allows for flux penetration by redistributing the density of bosons within the coherence volume .",
    "this leads to an increase of the order parameter compared with the homogeneous case ( @xmath20 ) in the region close to the vortex core .",
    "inside the core the order parameter is suppressed , as in the bcs superconductor . the resulting electric field , ( together with the magnetic field )",
    "acts as an additional centrifugal force increasing the steepness ( @xmath47 ) of the order parameter compared with the bcs superfluid , where @xmath57 .",
    "the breakdown of the local charge neutrality is due to the absence of any equilibrium @xmath58 state solution in cbg below @xmath0 line .",
    "both superconducting ( @xmath59 ) and normal ( @xmath60 ) solutions are allowed at any temperature in the bcs superconductors .",
    "then the system decides which of two phases ( or their mixture ) is energetically favorable , but the local charge neutrality is respected .",
    "in contrast , there is no equilibrium normal state solution ( with @xmath61 ) in cbg below @xmath0-line because it does not respect the density sum rule .",
    "hence , there are no different phases to mix , and the only way to acquire a flux in the thermal equilibrium is to redistribute the local density of bosons at the expense of their coulomb energy .",
    "this energy determines the vortex free energy @xmath62 , which is the difference of the energy of cbg with , @xmath63 , and without , @xmath64 , magnetic flux , @xmath65\\psi _ { s}{\\bf ( r)}|^{2}\\cr & + & e\\phi _ { c}\\phi \\lbrack |\\psi _ { s}{\\bf ( r)}%    } } } \\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using eqs.(2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) it can be written in the dimensionless form as @xmath66\\rho d\\rho .\\ ] ] in the large @xmath67 limit the main contribution comes from the region @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the energy is thus the same as that in the bcs superconductor , @xmath71 .",
    "it is seen that the most stable solution is the formation of the vortex with one flux quantum , @xmath72 and the lower critical field is the same as in the bcs superconductor , @xmath73 @xcite . however , different from the bcs superconductor , where the ginsburg - landau phenomenology is microscopically justified in the temperature region close to @xmath74 , the cbg vortex structure is derived here in the low temperature region . actually the zero temperature solution is applied in a wide temperature region well below the bose - einstein condensation temperature , where the depletion of the condensate remains small .",
    "the actual size of the charged core is about @xmath75 .",
    "if we `` switch off '' the coulomb repulsion between bosons , an ideal cbg can not be bose - condensed at finite temperatures in a homogeneous magnetic field because of a one - dimensional particle motion at the lowest landau level @xcite .",
    "however , an interacting charged bose - gas is condensed in a field lower than a certain critical value @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "collisions between bosons and/or with impurities and phonons make the motion three - dimensional , and eliminate the one - dimensional singularity of the density of states , which prevents bec of the ideal gas in the filed . as we show below the upper critical field of cbg",
    "differs significantly from @xmath76 of bcs superconductors .",
    "it has an unusual positive curvature near @xmath74 , @xmath77 and diverges at @xmath78 , if there is no localisation due to a random potential .",
    "the localization can drastically change the low - temperature behavior of @xmath0 , so that at high density of impurities a re - entry effect to the normal state might occur .    in line with the conventional definition ,",
    "@xmath0 is a field , where a first nonzero solution of the linearized stationary equation for the macroscopic condensate wave function occurs , @xmath79^{2}+\\mu \\right ] \\psi _ { s}({\\bf r})\\cr & = & v_{scat}({\\bf r } ) \\psi _ { s}({\\bf r}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we introduce the `` scattering '' potential @xmath80 caused , for example , by particle - particle and/or particle - impurity collisions .",
    "let us first discuss noninteracting bosons , @xmath81 their energy spectrum in the homogeneous magnetic field is @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "bec occurs when the chemical potential `` touches '' the lowest band edge from below , i.e. @xmath85 .",
    "hence , quite different from the gl equation , the schrdinger equation ( 13 ) does not allow for a direct determination of @xmath86 , in fact , it determines the value of the chemical potential . then using this value the upper critical field is found from the density sum rule , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the density of states ( dos ) of the hamiltonian , eq.(13 ) , @xmath89^{-1}$ ] is the bose - einstein distribution function , and @xmath90 is the lowest band edge . for ideal bosons we have @xmath91 and @xmath92 substituting this dos into eq.(15 ) yields @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the number of bosons occupying the levels from @xmath95 to @xmath96 this number is practically the same as in zero field , @xmath97 , if @xmath98 on the contrary , the number of bosons on the lowest level , @xmath99 is given by a divergent integral on the left - hand side of eq.(18 ) .",
    "hence the only solution to eq.(16 ) is @xmath100    the scattering of bosons effectively removes the one - dimensional singularity in @xmath101 leading to a finite dos near the bottom of the lowest level , @xmath102 using the fermi - dirac golden rule the collision broadening of the lowest level @xmath103 is proportional to the same dos @xmath104 so that @xmath105 scales with the field as @xmath106 .",
    "then the number of bosons at the lowest level is estimated as @xmath107 as long as @xmath108 here we apply the one - dimensional dos , but cut the integral at @xmath105 from below .",
    "finally we arrive at @xmath109 where @xmath110 , and @xmath111 is a temperature independent constant .",
    "the scaling constant @xmath111 depends on the scattering mechanism . if we write @xmath112 ,  then the characteristic length is @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the zero - field mean - free path of low energy bosons",
    ".    -0.5 mm    the upper critical field has a nonlinear behaviour , @xmath115 in the vicinity of @xmath74 , and diverges at low - temperatures as @xmath116 these simple scaling arguments are fully confirmed by dos calculations with impurity @xcite and boson - boson @xcite scattering .",
    "the `` coherence '' length @xmath117 of cbg , eq.(22 ) , depends on the mean free path @xmath114 and the inter - particle distance @xmath118 it has nothing to do with the size of the bipolaron , and could be as large as the coherence length of the weak - coupling bcs superconductors .",
    "thus @xmath0 of strongly - coupled superconductors has a `` 3/2 '' curvature near @xmath74 different from the linear bcs @xmath0 .",
    "the curvature is a universal feature of cbg , which does not depend on a particular scattering mechanism and on approximations made .",
    "another interesting feature of strongly - coupled superconductors is a breakdown of the pauli paramagnetic limit given by @xmath119 in the weak - coupling theory .",
    "@xmath0 of bipolarons exceeds this limit because the singlet bipolaron binding energy @xmath120 is  much larger than their @xmath121 bosons are condensed at @xmath15 no matter what their energy spectrum is .",
    "hence , in the charged bose - gas model , @xmath122 , fig.1 . for composed bosons , like bipolarons , the pair - breaking limit is given by @xmath123 , so that @xmath124",
    "in cuprates @xcite , spin - ladders @xcite and organic superconductors @xcite high magnetic field studies revealed a non - bcs upward curvature of resistive @xmath0 . when measurements were performed on low-@xmath74 unconventional superconductors @xcite , the pauli limit was exceeded by several times .",
    "a non - linear temperature dependence in the vicinity of @xmath125 was unambigously observed in a few samples @xcite .",
    "importantly , a thermodynamically determined @xmath86 turned out much higher than the resistive @xmath86 @xcite due to contrasting magnetic field dependencies of the specific heat anomaly and of resistive transition .",
    "we believe that many unconventional superconductors are in the ` bosonic ' limit of preformed real - space bipolarons , so their resistive @xmath86 is actually a critical field of the bose - einstein condensation of charged bosons @xcite .",
    "calculations carried out for the heat capacity of cbg ( see below ) lead to the conclusion that the resistive @xmath86 and the thermodynamically determined @xmath86 are very different in bosonic superconductors . while the magnetic field destroys the condensate of ideal bosons , it hardly shifts the specific heat anomaly as observed .    a comprehensive scaling of resistive @xmath86 measurements in unconventional superconductors is shown in fig.2 @xcite in the framework of the microscopic model of charged bosons scattered off impurities ( section 2 ) .",
    "generalised eq.(21 ) accounting for a temperature dependence of the number of delocalised bosons , @xmath126 can be written as @xmath127 ^{3/2}.\\ ] ] in the vicinity of @xmath74 one obtains the parameter - free @xmath128 using eq.(23 ) , but the low - temperature behaviour depends on a particular scattering mechanism , and a detailed structure of the density of localised states . as suggested by the normal state hall measurements in cuprates @xmath129 can be parameterised as @xmath130 @xcite , so that @xmath0 is described by a single - parameter expression as @xmath131 ^{3/2}.\\ ] ]    -0.5 mm    the parameter @xmath132 is proportional to the number of delocalised bosons at zero temperature .",
    "we expect that this expression is applied in the whole temperature region except ultra - low temperatures , where the fermi golden - rule in the scaling fails .",
    "exceeding the pauli pair - breaking limit readely follows from the fact , that the singlet - pair binding energy is related to the normal - state pseudogap temperature @xmath133 , rather than to @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath133 is higher than @xmath74 in bosonic superconductors , and cuprates .",
    "the universal scaling of @xmath86 near @xmath74 is confirmed by resistive measurements of the upper critical field of many cuprates , spin - ladders , and organic superconductors , as shown in fig.2 .",
    "all measurements reveal a universal @xmath134 behaviour in a wide temperature region ( inset ) , when they are fitted by eq.(24 ) .",
    "the low - temperature behaviour of @xmath135 is not universal , but well described using the same equation with the single fitting parameter , @xmath132 .",
    "the parameter is close to @xmath136 in high quality cuprates with a very narrow resistive transition @xcite .",
    "it naturally becomes rather small in overdoped cuprates where randomness is more essential , so almost all bosons are localised ( at least in one dimension ) at zero temperature .",
    "bose liquids ( or more precisely @xmath137 ) show the characteristic @xmath138 -point singularity of their specific heat , but superfluid fermi liquids  like bcs superconductors exhibit a sharp second order phase transition accompanied by a finite jump in the specific heat .",
    "it was established beyond doubt @xcite that the anomaly in high @xmath74 cuprates differs qualitatively from the bsc prediction . as was stressed by salamon et al.@xcite",
    "the heat capacity is logarithmic near the transition , and consequently , can not be adequately treated by the mean - field bcs theory even including the gaussian fluctuations . in particular , estimates using the gaussian fluctuations yield an unusually small coherence volume @xcite , and @xmath139 number of the order of one .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the anomaly @xcite is also unusual , but it can be described by the bipolaron model @xcite .",
    "calculations of the specific heat of charged bosons in a magnetic field require an analytical dos , @xmath140 of a particle , scattered by other particles and/or by a random potential of impurities .",
    "we can use dos in the magnetic filed with an impurity scattering , which allows for an analytical result @xcite .",
    "the specific heat coefficient @xmath141 - 1}\\ ] ] calculated with this dos and with @xmath142 determined from @xmath143 is shown in fig.3 .",
    "the broad maximum at @xmath144 is practically the same as in the ideal bose gas without scattering @xcite .",
    "it barely shifts in the magnetic field . however , there is the second anomaly at lower temperatures , which is absent in the ideal gas .",
    "it shifts with the magnetic field , tracing precisely the resistive transition , as clearly seen from the difference between the specific heat in the field and zero - field curve , fig .",
    "3b . the specific heat , fig .",
    "3 , is in striking resemblance with the geneva group s experiments on @xmath145 and on @xmath146 @xcite , where both anomalies were observed . within the bipolaron model , when the magnetic field is applied",
    ", it hardly changes the temperature dependence of the chemical potential near the zero field @xmath74 because the energy spectrum of thermally excited bosons is practically unchanged .",
    "that is because their characteristic energy ( of the order of @xmath74 ) remains huge compared with the magnetic energy of the order of @xmath147 .",
    "in contrast , the energy spectrum of low energy bosons is strongly perturbed even by a weak magnetic field . as a result",
    "the chemical potential ` touches ' the band edge at lower temperatures , while having almost the same ` kink'-like temperature dependence around @xmath74 as in zero field .",
    "while the lower anomaly corresponds to the true long - range order due to the bose - einstein condensation , the higher one is just a ` memory ' about the zero - field transition .",
    "this microscopic consideration shows that a genuine phase transition into a superconducting state is related to resistive transition and to the lower specific heat anomaly , while the broad higher anomaly is the normal state feature of the bosonic system in the external magnetic field .",
    "different from the bcs superconductor these two anomalies are well separated in the bosonic superconductor at any field but zero .    in conclusion , the bipolaron theory of the critical fields and vortex structures in strong - coupling superconductors has been reviewed .",
    "a single vortex in this regime has a charged core and its profile different from the vortex in neutral and bcs superfluids .",
    "the upper critical field is also qualitatively different from the weak and intermediate - coupling @xmath0 .",
    "we have interpreted unusual resistive upper critical fields of many unconventional superconductors as the bose - einstein condensation field of preformed bosons - bipolarons .",
    "their nonlinear temperature dependences follow from the scaling arguments . exceeding the pauli paramagnetic limit",
    "has been explained , and the controversy in the determination of @xmath0 of cuprates from kinetic and thermodynamic measurements has been addressed in the framework of the bipolaron theory ."
