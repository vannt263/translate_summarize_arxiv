    "the main goal of this note is to provide a gentle introduction to the theory of feynman - jackson integrals , and to compute an example of such integrals as explicitly as possible . roughly speaking feynman - jackson integrals are the analogue in @xmath0-calculus of feynman integrals .",
    "the name of jackson is included since integration in @xmath0-calculus was introduced by f.h .",
    "jackson , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our computations are done in the one dimensional setting .",
    "extending our concepts to higher dimensions , in particular to infinite dimensions , is the main problem in this subject . in principle",
    "such extension is possible but making the notation easy to handle is hard , as the reader will learn by looking at the simple case of one dimensional integrals .",
    "+ the other fundamental task in this subject matter is to find applications of feynman - jackson integrals in physics .",
    "although in this note we focus on the mathematical properties of such integrals , we believe that our formalism will find applications thanks to the following facts :    * in this paper our emphasis is on feynman - jackson integrals which rely on the construction of a @xmath0-analogue of the gaussian measure .",
    "given the widespread range of applications in mathematics and physics alike of the gaussian measure , we expect its @xmath0-analogue to gradually find its natural set of applications .",
    "the subject of @xmath0-probability theory and @xmath0-random processes is still in a developing phase , but already a solid step forward has been taken by kupershmidt in @xcite .",
    "* @xmath0-calculus is adapted to work with arbitrary functions while the usual rules of calculus demand certain kind of regularity .",
    "the @xmath0-gaussian measure is likely to find applications in the context of highly non - regular phenomena . *",
    "jackson integrals are given by infinite sums .",
    "cutting off the number of terms appearing in such sums provides a natural regularization method for diverging jackson integrals . *",
    "classically , we think of the continuous as a limit of the discrete .",
    "indeed , in the limit @xmath1 we recover from feynman - jackson integrals the usual feynman integrals .",
    "thus our feynman - jackson integrals provide a new method for computing feynman integrals : first compute the corresponding feynman - jackson integral and then take the limit as @xmath0 goes to @xmath2 . * from a quantum perspective , it is the continuous that should be regarded as an approximation to the fundamental discrete quantum theory . in particular it has been argued , see @xcite , @xcite , that in the quantization of gravity discrete structures will emerge naturally . if that is so , then integration over discrete structures may become a fundamental issue .",
    "our formalism may shed some light as the form that such theory of discrete integration may take .",
    "we emphasize that the calculus itself in @xmath0-calculus is discrete while the variables involved remain continuous .",
    "let us recall some notions of @xmath0-calculus , see @xcite , @xcite,@xcite and @xcite for more information .",

    "indeed , the moments of the gaussian measure are    @xmath21{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2}}x^{2n}dx= ( 2n-1)(2n-3) ... 7.5.3.1,\\ ] ]    and    @xmath22{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2}}x^{2n+1}dx= 0.\\ ] ]    the number @xmath23 is often denoted by @xmath24 and is called the double factorial .",
    "the reader may consult @xcite for a natural generalization of such numbers .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath23 counts the number of pairings on the set @xmath25=\\{1,2, ... ,2n\\}.$ ] a pairing on @xmath25 $ ] is a partition of @xmath25 $ ] into @xmath26 blocks each of cardinality two .",
    "so for example we have that    @xmath27{2\\pi}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2}}x^{4}dx= 3,\\ ] ]    since as shown in figure [ fig : pochha graphs ] there are @xmath28 pairings on a set with @xmath29 elements .    thus we see that the gaussian measure has a clear cut combinatorial meaning .",
    "this simple fact explains the source of graphs in the computation of feynman integrals . in order to define the @xmath0-analogue of the gaussian measure we must find @xmath0-analogues for the objects appearing in the gaussian measure , namely @xmath30{2\\pi},\\infty , e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2 } } , x^n$ ] and @xmath31 .",
    "the lebesgue measure @xmath31 agrees with riemann integration for good functions .",
    "thus it is only natural to replace @xmath31 by jackson integration @xmath32 while the factor @xmath33 remains unchanged , finding the @xmath0-analogue of @xmath34 is actually quite a subtle matter .",
    "first , we must find a @xmath0-analogue for the exponential function @xmath35 which is characterized by the properties @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",

    "it is amusing that whereas the classical gaussian measure is given by an improper integral , its @xmath0-analogue turns out to be a definite integral whose limits depend on @xmath0 and go to ( plus or minus ) infinity as @xmath0 approaches to @xmath2 .",
    "a similar situation occurs with the integral representations of the @xmath0-analogue of the gamma function , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "indeed , without further motivation we shall take the boundary limits in the gaussian integrals to be @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 to find the @xmath0-analogue @xmath51 of the @xmath52  appearing in gaussian integrals we must demand that @xmath51 be such that @xmath53_q}}d_qx = 1.\\ ] ] thus @xmath51 is given by @xmath54_q}}d_qx = 2\\int_{0}^{\\nu } e_{q^{2}}^{\\frac{-q^2x^2}{[2]_q}}d_qx = 2(1-q)\\nu\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}q^n e_{q^{2}}^{\\frac{-q^2(q^n\\nu)^2}{[2]_q}},\\ ] ] so    @xmath55_{q^{2}}!}\\ ] ]    and interchanging the order of summation we get the identity    @xmath56_{q^{2}}!}.\\ ] ]    since @xmath57 we obtain the amusing identity    @xmath58_{q^{2}}!}.\\ ] ]    we now look for the @xmath0-analogue of identities @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the moments of gaussian integrals .",
