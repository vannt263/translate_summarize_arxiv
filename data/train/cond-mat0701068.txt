    "since the discovery of unconventional superconductivity in the non - cuprate oxide sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 , considerable attention has been paid to study its electronic and magnetic properties in the normal and superconducting states.@xcite this material  with a layered perovskite structure identical to the prototype high - t@xmath4 superconductor ( la , sr / ba)@xmath0cuo@xmath1  has been identified to exhibit spin triplet ( p - wave ) superconductivity below 1  k.@xcite besides superconductivity , sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 exhibits several other unusual features in its normal state . for instance , transport studies have revealed fermi liquid behavior with an electrical resistivity that shows quadratic temperature dependence below 25  k.@xcite secondly , the material shows a large electronic specific heat ( @xmath5 37.5 mj / mol - k@xmath6 and a strongly enhanced pauli susceptibility ( @xmath7emu / mol ) reflecting heavy - fermion behavior.@xcite it has been recognized that both structural and magnetic instabilities play a crucial role for the unconventional superconductivity in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1.@xcite recent theoretical calculations have suggested that sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is close to a ferromagnetic ( fm ) instability@xcite with strong fm spin fluctuations which may lead to spin triplet p - wave superconductivity.@xcite    as for the structural aspect , while crystal transformation is common in most cuprate oxides , no long range structural distortion / transformation has been detected for sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 down to 100  mk.@xcite however , a local ( short - ranged ) structural instability related to a rotation of the ruo@xmath8 octahedra has been detected by braden et al . , using phonon dispersion information obtained by inelastic neutron scattering.@xcite to our knowledge , no other experimental study related to structural instabilities in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 has been reported .",
    "considering the many unusual physical properties , including unconventional superconductivity , it is desirable to carry out additional investigations , particularly with help of microscopic techniques , to examine structural distortions / instabilities in undoped sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 . for this purpose ,",
    "hyperfine methods such as mssbauer spectroscopy , nuclear magnetic / quadrupole resonance ( nmr / nqr ) or time - differential perturbed angular correlation ( tdpac ) are extremely useful .",
    "in particular , information on structural properties such as lattice transformation and/or distortion can be extracted by studying the electric - field gradient ( efg ) tensor obtained from nuclear quadrupole interaction measurements .",
    "performing such studies with nmr or nqr has been found to be difficult , due to a.o .",
    "low isotopic abundance , small quadrupole moments , strong spin lattice relaxation and large line broadening .",
    "@xcite similarly , due to the large line width , mssbauer spectroscopy using the native @xmath9ru isotope is also not suitable for measuring small lattice distortions .",
    "such experimental difficulties , however , can be overcome using the tdpac method@xcite . with a suitable probe nucleus such as @xmath2cd , the tdpac technique can be very effective for detection of static and dynamic lattice distortions .",
    "in this paper we report our results on a lattice instability in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 observed from quadrupole interaction measurements at a @xmath2cd probe nucleus measured by tdpac spectroscopy .",
    "the experimental results show evidence of a _ dynamic _ lattice distortion below 300  k revealed by : ( i ) a rapidly fluctuating electric - field gradient ( efg ) tensor and ( ii ) a temperature dependent change of the efg asymmetry parameter @xmath3 . taking into account _",
    "ab  initio _ calculations based on density functional theory ( dft ) , we argue that the observed dynamic lattice distortion is caused by strong spin fluctuations associated with an inherent magnetic instability of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "a polycrystalline sample of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 was prepared following a standard procedure .",
    "a mixture of stoichoimetric amounts of high purity srco@xmath10 and ruo@xmath0 was pelletized and sintered at 1100@xmath11c for 12  h. after regrinding , the powder was pressed into a pellet and heated in air at 1100@xmath11c for another 18  h followed by furnace cooling .",
    "the sample was characterized by powder x - ray diffraction , showing a single phase having the k@xmath0nif@xmath1-type tetragonal structure with lattice papameters a = 3.868(5 )    and c = 12.732(5 )   which agree well with the earlier data.@xcite the @xmath2cd probe was introduced into a small piece of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 by diffusing carrier free parent @xmath2 in activity at 1050@xmath11c for 24  h followed by rapid cooling to room temperature .",
    "it is important to mention that the typical concentration of cd in the sample remains below 1  ppm and thus does not alter the basic physical properties of the material .",
    "the electric quadrupole interaction parameters were extracted from the life time spectra of the 247 kev , i=5/2 and 84  ns level of the daughter @xmath2cd nucleus produced by electron capture ( ec ) decay of @xmath2 in .",
    "the time spectra were recorded simultaneously in a 90@xmath11/180@xmath11 geometry using a set - up consisting of four baf@xmath0 detectors and a standard slow - fast coincidence circuit having a time resolution better than 700 ps .",
    "measurements were carried out as a function of temperature in the range 20 - 500 k using either a closed cycle helium refrigerator or a specially designed furnace . the perturbation factor",
    "a@xmath12g@xmath13 in the angular correlation function @xmath14 was obtained by constructing the appropriate ratio function , called the time spectrum @xcite , @xmath15}{[w(180^\\circ , t)+2w(90^\\circ , t)]}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 are the background - subtracted normalized coincidence counts of detectors placed at 180@xmath11 and 90@xmath11 .",
    "the spectra were fitted to the function @xcite      to extract the interaction frequency @xmath18 related to the principal component v@xmath19 of the efg tensor@xcite : @xmath20 ( expression valid for half - integer spin ) , the asymmetry @xmath21 of the efg tensor , and the relaxation time @xmath22 which is related to the distribution width @xmath23 of @xmath24 by @xmath25 . for our data , using a lorenzian frequency distribution yielded a better @xmath26 than a gaussian spread in @xmath24 .",
    "complimentary to the tdpac experiments , we performed a series of _ ab initio _",
    "calculations on pure and cd - doped sr@xmath27ruo@xmath28 .",
    "the calculations were performed within density functional theory@xcite , using the augmented plane waves + local orbitals ( apw+lo ) method@xcite as implemented in the wien2k package@xcite to solve the scalar - relativistic kohn - sham equations . in the apw+lo method ,",
    "the wave functions are expanded in spherical harmonics inside nonoverlapping atomic spheres of radius @xmath29 , and in plane waves in the remaining space of the unit cell ( = the interstitial region ) . for sr , ru and cd a @xmath29 value of 1.85 a.u .",
    "was chosen , for o we used @xmath301.55 a.u .",
    "the maximum @xmath31 for the expansion of the wave function in spherical harmonics inside the spheres was taken to be @xmath32 .",
    "the plane wave expansion of the wave function in the interstitial region was made up to @xmath33  a.u.@xmath34 for pure sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 and for supercells with 8 formula units , and up to @xmath35  a.u.@xmath34 for supercells with 16 formula units ( this reduced accuracy has an effect on e.g.  the electric - field gradient of less than 10% ) .",
    "the charge density was fourier expanded up to @xmath36 . for the sampling of the brillouin zone , a special k - mesh equivalent to 8@xmath378@xmath378 mesh in the pure sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 structure was used throughout .",
    "as exchange - correlation functional , the perdew - burke - ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) was used.@xcite as table  [ tab2 ] shows , this type of calculations is able to reproduce correctly some experimentally known structural and efg properties of pure sr@xmath27ruo@xmath28 .",
    "the structural information is also in agreement with previous _",
    "ab  initio _",
    "calculations,@xcite while for the efg s our gga results show much better agreement with respect to experiment than reported values obtained using the local density approximation.@xcite    .comparison of some structural and electric - field gradient parameters for i4/mmm sr@xmath27ruo@xmath28 with fully optimized theoretical lattice constants and internal positions ( left ) , and the corresponding experimental data ( right ) .",
    "[ tab2 ] [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     if no spin - polarization no r lattice relaxation is allowed , the main component of the efg tensor at a cd impurity substituting ru is calculated to be v@xmath38v",
    "/ m@xmath39 ( tab .",
    "[ tab3 ] ) .",
    "including lattice relaxation , the efg decreases to v@xmath40v / m@xmath39 .",
    "both these values are smaller compared to the range of experimental values observed in the temperature interval 20500  k. the efg tensor is in both cases axially symmetric ( @xmath41 ) , due to the point group symmetry at the ru site . for the spin - polarized calculations ,",
    "we tried two different spin configurations : antiferromagnetic ( af ) and ferromagnetic ( fm ) . without lattice relaxations , the value of v@xmath19 gets somewhat smaller compared to the non - magnetic case .",
    "it becomes considerably larger , however , if lattice relaxations are allowed : the magnetism does not affect the efg directly , but it affects the lattice relaxation , which in turn affects the efg .",
    "most importantly , the order of magnitude ( 4.2 - 4.5 ) of v@xmath19 is now perfectly comparable to the experimental observation ( 4.2 when extrapolated to 0  k ) .",
    "this corroborates our assumption that cd indeed substitutes a ru atom .",
    "if the applied spin configuration lacks axial symmetry ( as is the case for our af configuration , and as will be the case for any ` random ' spin configuration that is the momentaneous result of fluctuating spins ) , the calculations show a non - zero @xmath3 does indeed appear .",
    "the calculated values of 0.09 and 0.01 are smaller than the observed maximum of 0.30 , but these values are for one particular af configuration only . taken all together , these _ ab  initio _ calculations demonstrate that different spin configuration ( as they appear during the spin fluctuation process ) do indeed influence the efg tensor at the cd site , and lead to better numerical agreement between the calculated and measured efg tensor .    in summary , by studying the quadrupole interaction of @xmath2cd using the tdpac technique and _ ab  initio _ calculations ,",
    "we have found evidence for a dynamic lattice distortion in sr@xmath27ruo@xmath28 reflected by a rapidly fluctuating electric field gradient ( efg ) and a temperature dependent change of its asymmetry parameter ( @xmath3 ) .",
