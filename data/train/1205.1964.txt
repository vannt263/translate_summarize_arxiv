    "we provide a development that unifies , simplifies and extends considerably a number of minimax results in the restricted parameter space estimation literature .",
    "as illustrated with a series of examples , the unified minimax result has wide applicability with respect to the nature of the constraint , the underlying probability model and the loss function utilized .    to further put into context the findings of this paper , consider a basic situation where @xmath0 , with @xmath1 ( @xmath2 known ) , and where @xmath3 is estimated under squared error loss @xmath4 .",
    "katz @xcite established that the bayes estimator @xmath5 with respect to the flat prior on @xmath6 dominates the minimum risk equivariant ( mre ) estimator @xmath7 .",
    "however , @xmath8 remains a useful benchmark estimator with its constant risk matching the minimax risk , and with any improvement , such as @xmath5 , being necessarily minimax as well . in a technical sense and roughly speaking , the form ( and unboundedness ) of the restricted parameter space @xmath9 preserves a common structure with the unrestricted parameter space @xmath10 , and the constructions of the least favourable sequence of priors for both problems are isomorphic , leading to the same minimax values .",
    "in contrast , the restriction to a compact interval @xmath11 $ ] is quite different and lowers the minimax risk ( see example ( c ) in section [ sec3 ] ) .",
    "now , the above phenomenon is not only more general ( e.g. , general location families with absolutely continuous lebesgue densities and strictly convex loss @xcite ) , but similar results have been established in various other situations , beginning with blumenthal and cohen @xcite in the context of ordered location parameters .",
    "many other such contributions will be referred to below , but at this point we refer to the monograph of van eeden  @xcite , as well as the review paper by marchand and strawderman @xcite , which contain a  substantial amount of material and references relating to such problems .",
    "in this paper , we provide a unified framework for the above - mentioned problems , as well as many others either for more general loss and/or model , or for new situations such as estimating quantiles or covariance matrices under parametric restrictions . while results for certain of the problems ( e.g. , ( a ) and ( b ) ) are not new (",
    "although we generalize some to more general loss functions ) and certain others have been studied for squared error loss , we greatly expand the set of loss functions for which minimaxity is established ( e.g. , ( c)(f ) ) , certain of the problems ( e.g. , ( g ) and ( h ) and remark [ rem2 ] ) have not been extensively studied and thus our problems and results are mostly new . in section [ sec2 ] , we formalize the general argument , relying on the existence of a least favourable sequence ( proposition [ brown ] ) , setting up",
    "_ conditions _ on the restricted parameter space that facilitate a  correspondence with the above sequence ( theorem [ minimax ] ) and inferring ( corollary  [ mre ] ) that a minimax mre estimator remains minimax with the introduction of a  restriction on the parameter space under given _",
    "detailed examples follow in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "these include the estimation of location or scale parameters under a lower ( or upper ) bound restriction , location parameter vectors restricted to a polyhedral cone , scale parameters subject to restricted ratios or products , linear combinations of restricted location parameters , location parameters bounded to an interval with unknown scale , quantiles for location - scale families with parametric restrictions and covariance matrices with restricted traces or determinants .",
    "we begin with the following fact concerning minimax problems , presented as a synthesized version of parts of the appendix of @xcite , pages 254268 .",
    "[ brown ] let @xmath12 be the minimax value in a problem with sample space @xmath13 and parameter space @xmath14 , both euclidean .",
    "suppose the probability measures are absolutely continuous with respect to a @xmath15-finite measure , that the loss @xmath16 is lower semicontinuous on the action space and that @xmath17 as @xmath18 for all @xmath3 .",
    "then there exists a sequence of prior distributions with finite support and with bayes risks equal to  @xmath19 , such that @xmath19 approaches @xmath20 as @xmath21 , and there also exists a minimax procedure .",
    "we make use of a classical framework for invariant statistical problems .",
    "this includes a  group of transformations @xmath22 with an invariant family of probability measures @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 implies @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 forming a corresponding group of actions on @xmath14 .",
    "as well , for estimating a  parametric function @xmath29 with loss @xmath30 , additional assumptions include the condition that  @xmath31 depends on @xmath3 only through @xmath29 , and that the group action on the decision space  @xmath32 satisfies the condition @xmath33 for all @xmath34 ( e.g. , @xcite , section 3.2 ) . with the help of proposition [ brown ] ,",
    "we obtain the following result .",
    "[ minimax ] let a problem satisfying the conditions of proposition [ brown ] be invariant under a group @xmath22 and let @xmath35 be minimax for a full parameter space @xmath14 .",
    "suppose now that the parameter space is restricted to a subset @xmath36 ; that there exist sequences @xmath37 and @xmath38 , such that @xmath39 ; and that @xmath40 .",
    "then @xmath35 remains minimax in the restricted parameter space problem .",
    "let @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath19 be , respectively , proposition [ brown ] s sequence of priors , sequence of corresponding finite supports and bayes risks , with @xmath43 as @xmath21 .",
    "choose @xmath44 sufficiently large so that @xmath45 implies @xmath46 . as we show below , the prior distribution with finite support @xmath47 , given by @xmath48 has bayes risk @xmath49 .",
    "this implies directly that @xmath35 is minimax , since @xmath50 , as @xmath21 by theorem 5.18 of @xcite .",
    "it remains to show that the bayes risks of @xmath41 and @xmath51 coincide , and a standard argument is as follows .",
    "let @xmath52 be any estimator .",
    "then , for its risk , we have : @xmath53 by invariance .",
    "it follows that , if we set @xmath54 , then @xmath55 = e^{\\theta}\\bigl[r\\bigl(\\bar{g}_{m(n)}^{-1}\\theta , { g_{m(n)}^{*-1 } } \\delta_n\\bigl(g_{m(n)}x\\bigr)\\bigr)\\bigr ] \\\\ & = & e^{\\tilde{\\theta}}\\bigl[r\\bigl(\\tilde{\\theta } , { g^{*-1}_{m(n ) } } \\delta_n\\bigl(g_{m(n)}(x)\\bigr)\\bigr)\\bigr ] = r_n^*,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the bayes estimator corresponding to @xmath41 and hence @xmath57 is the bayes estimator corresponding to @xmath51 .    for applications , we will take @xmath58 of theorem [ minimax ] to match @xmath36 , but it is potentially more convenient to take @xmath58 as a sequence of open neighborhoods . now , since the best equivariant estimators are often minimax , we deduce the following widely applicable result .",
    "[ mre ] if an mre estimator in a given problem satisfying the conditions of theorem [ minimax ] is minimax , then it remains minimax in the restricted problem provided the restricted parameter space @xmath36 satisfies the conditions of theorem [ minimax ] .",
    "for the sake of clarity , we do not assume that the action space and the image of the restricted parameter space coincide .",
    "hence , minimax estimators that can be derived from theorem [ minimax ] or corollary [ mre ] are not forced to take values in @xmath36 .",
    "the main motivation resides in the benchmarking ( i.e. , dominating estimators that take values in @xmath36 are necessarily minimax ) and preservation of minimaxity ( the minimax risks on @xmath14 and @xmath36 are equivalent ) .",
    "an important class of further applications of corollary [ mre ] will arise in cases where @xmath59 is minimax for the unrestricted problem @xmath14 and the parameter space @xmath36 and loss @xmath16 are convex , in which case the projection of @xmath59 onto @xmath36 will dominate @xmath59 and hence be minimax .",
    "[ hunt - stein ] notwithstanding the conditions required on the restricted parameter space  @xmath36 , the applicability of corollary [ mre ] hinges on the minimaxity of the best equivariant estimator , in particular for unrestricted parameter space versions . as studied and established by several authors , it turns out that it is frequently the case that a minimax equivariant rule exists .",
    "we refer to @xcite , section 6.7 , @xcite , section 9.5 and @xcite , note  9.3 , pages 421422 , for general expositions and many useful references . in particular , the hunt  stein theorem gives , for invariant problems , conditions on the group ( amenability ) that guarantee the existence of a minimax equivariant estimator whenever a minimax procedure exists .",
    "@xcite is a key reference .",
    "all of the examples below relate to amenable groups , such as the additive and multiplicative groups , the group of location - scale transformations and the group of lower triangular @xmath60 non - singular matrices with positive diagonal elements .",
    "we focus here on various applications , illustrating how the results of section [ sec2 ] apply to both existing and new results .",
    "we accompany this with further observations and remarks .",
    "as previously mentioned , such applications are quite varied with respect to model , loss and shape of the restricted parameter space . at the expense of some redundancy ,",
    "some particular cases are singled out ( e.g. , ( a ) is a particular case of ( d ) , while ( b ) is a particular case of ( e ) ) for their practical or historical importance .",
    "however , we do not focus here on specific determinations of the mre estimators , but do refer to textbooks that treat in detail such topics ( e.g. , @xcite ) . throughout",
    ", we consider loss functions that satisfy the conditions of proposition [ brown ] , and our findings relate to univariate and multivariate continuous probability models with absolutely continuous lebesgue densities .",

    "consider further a  lower ( or upper ) bounded parameter space @xmath36 ( i.e. , @xmath65 or @xmath66 $ ] ) .",

    "the result is not new ( see , e.g. , @xcite , for a normal model and squared error loss ; @xcite , for strictly convex @xmath71 ; @xcite , for strict bowl - shaped losses ) . finally , we mention the implication that the minimaxity property is hence shared by any dominator of the mre estimator , which includes quite generally the bayes estimator of @xmath72 associated with the flat prior on @xmath36 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "b.

    "whenever a minimax estimator exists for the unconstrained case @xmath81 , it is necessarily given by the mre estimator or equivalently by the bayes estimator with respect to the non - informative prior @xmath82 .",

    "also , we refer to the three last references for earlier results obtained for specific models @xmath75 , namely gamma and fisher models .",
