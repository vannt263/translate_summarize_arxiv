    "the sun is immersed in two concentric volumes of interstellar material with very different properties . in the immediate surroundings [ out to distances ranging from 0.05 to several pc away ( redfield & linsky 2000 ) ] , the gas is partly ionized , with characteristic properties @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10k ( lallement 1998 ; puyoo & ben jaffel 1998 ; ferlet 1999 ; gry & jenkins 2001 ) . this cloud , often called the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) , is surrounded by a large cavity containing fully - ionized , very hot , low - density material with @xmath11 and @xmath12k ( berghfer et al . 1998 ; burrows & guo 1998 ) that is prominent in soft x - ray emission ( snowden et al .",
    "1990 , 1998 ) .",
    "this large volume of hot gas is believed to be the product of probably several supernova explosions ( cox & reynolds 1987 ; breitschwerdt & schmutzler 1994 ; maz - apellniz 2001 ; smith & cox 2001 ) and is known as the local bubble ( lb ) .",
    "the lb is also conspicuous by showing a general absence of cold , neutral gas up to a well defined boundary ( sfeir et al .",
    "1999 ; vergely et al .",
    "2001 ) , as is shown in figure  [ sfeirplt ] .",
    "a persistent puzzle has been the apparent mismatch in thermal pressures between the two media .",
    "using the parameters stated above , one finds that @xmath13k for the lic , which contrasts with an apparent representative value of @xmath14k for the fully - ionized , hot gas in the lb .",
    "the objective of the research presented here is to help answer the question , `` what thermal pressures are found for other neutral clouds within the local bubble ?",
    "that is , do they have values similar to the lic , or are they closer to matching the apparent pressure of the lb ? '' to gain insights on this question , one can observe stars located behind individual clouds inside the lb and measure their absorption features of c  i arising from different fine - structure levels of the ground state .",
    "the ratios of populations of these states are governed by an equilibrium between collisional excitations ( governed by local densities and temperatures ) and spontaneous radiative decays .",
    "stars suitable for viewing the c  i features had to satisfy a number of conditions to yield useful results .",
    "their selection is described in  [ plan ] ; ultimately four such stars were observed in a manner described in  [ obs ] .",
    "the c  i absorption features are very weak , and in order to obtain useful measures of their strengths particular care was exercised to remove spurious signals arising from the detector , as outlined in  [ artifacts ] .",
    "( mathematical details about the correction method are presented separately in the appendix . )",
    "section  [ analysis ] describes how the equivalent widths of various absorption features were combined and corrected for saturation ( very mild , except for one of the stars ) .",
    "this section also discusses the derivations of fine - structure population ratios , which may be compared to the theoretically expected values for different conditions (  [ expected_f1 ] ) . before one can derive useful limits for the thermal pressures , the allowable ranges of temperature must be constrained , and different methods of deriving these constraints are discussed in  [ temp_limits ] .",

    "[ summary ] .",
    "target stars chosen for the survey had to satisfy four fundamental criteria .",
    "first , the stars had to be within the local bubble or near its edge .",
    "second , they had to have sufficient neutral gas in front so that there was a reasonable expectation of seeing the c  i absorption features .",
    "third , the stars had to be bright enough to give a good signal - to - noise ratio in a reasonably short observing time . finally , the survey avoided stars with projected rotational velocities @xmath17 ( uesugi & fukuda 1981  with actual values provided by the vizier web site at the strasbourg data center ) , so that stellar features would not cause confusion when the interstellar lines were being identified and measured . to satisfy the first two requirements , the selection included stars less than about 100  pc away that had interstellar d - line absorption features indicating @xmath18(na  i ) @xmath19 .",
    "a compilation by welsh et al ( 1994 ) was a good source of information about d - line absorption at the time the survey was being planned .",
    "fluxes at 1565  listed in the _",
    "td-1 catalogue of stellar ultraviolet fluxes _",
    "( thompson et al . 1978 ) provided a good guide for selecting targets with satisfactory brightness levels .    to increase the chance that the c  i features arose from truly intervening material rather than circumstellar disks or shells around the target stars",
    ", the survey did not include candidates that had spectral types with an emission - line `` e '' designation ( hoffleit & jaschek 1982 ; slettebak 1982 ) or an excess iras flux at @xmath20 m relative to the normal expectation .",
    "short - period binaries were also rejected , since they could have interacting gas streams . as a final precaution against skewing the results with cases dominated by gaseous material",
    "very near the stars , there was an exclusion of targets that had excess diffuse infrared emission nearby in the sky ( gaustad & van buren 1993 ) , signifying the possible presence of dust grains being heated by the star .",

    "the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) on hst had a proven capability of achieving large signal - to - noise ratios for bright targets ( cardelli & ebbets 1994 ; cardelli 1995 ) .",
    "for this reason , this instrument was considered ideal for the objective of recording the weak c  i absorption features .",
    "the survey was originally intended to be completed before ghrs was to be replaced by the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) during the second hst servicing mission , but useful observations of @xmath1  del were not accomplished until after stis was installed .",
    "observations of @xmath3  ori , @xmath4  lup and @xmath2  cyg were carried out with the ech - a grating on ghrs , with a substep pattern that created 4 spectrum bins per detector diode ( step - patt=7 ) plus a sampling of the background level . the standard option for spectrum shifts ( fp - split mode ) allowed for an elimination of the detector s fixed - pattern noise in the spectrum (  [ artifacts ] and appendix  [ fpn_analysis ] ) .",
    "the ghrs observations were performed with costar in place to correct for the telescope s spherical aberration , and the 2  entrance aperture was used to increase the efficiency .",
    "the stis observations of @xmath1  del with the e140h grating had to be done using neutral density filters to prevent the mama detector count rate limits from being exceeded .",
    "the wavelength resolving powers of the ghrs observations were @xmath28 [ but with some extended wings in the line - spread function ",
    "see howk , savage & fabian ( 1999 ) ] , while that for the stis spectrum of @xmath1  del is 110,000 ( kimble et al .",
    "1998 ; leitherer 2001 ) .    the limited wavelength coverage of the ghrs digicon detector for echelle spectroscopy limited observations to only one multiplet at any particular moment .",
    "the multiplet of choice was the one at 1260@xmath23 , since it had well separated lines and was near the peak in the instrument s sensitivity .",
    "however , for late b - type stars ( @xmath2  cyg and @xmath1  del ) , a strong stellar feature seriously depresses the flux level at the position of this multiplet , so other multiplets had to be viewed for these stars .",
    "the stis observation of @xmath1  del covered many multiplets , but only the strong ones listed in table  [ ew ] gave useful results . for all stars , the s  ii triplet with features at 1250.584 , 1253.811 and 1259.519@xmath23",
    "was also observed to monitor the presence of a generally undepleted element in its favored stage of ionization in an h  i region .",
    "the abundance of s  ii served a useful purpose in constraining the temperature of the gas , as outlined in  [ temp_limits ] .",
    "in order to realize the full potential of ghrs in sensing very weak absorption features , it was necessary to remove spurious signal deviations caused by small changes in photocathode sensitivity with position .",
    "the intentional displacements in wavelength for different subexposures in the ghrs fp - split observing routine allowed these variations to be differentiated from real absorption features in the raw spectra .",
    "the method used here to derive independently the detector s fixed - pattern signal and the real spectral signal gave a direct solution and thus differed from the iterative technique described by ebbets ( 1992 ) , cardelli & ebbets ( 1994 ) and fitzpatrick & spitzer ( 1994 ) .",
    "details of this more direct method of solution are given in appendix  [ fpn_analysis ] .",
    "it is important to recognize that for any given wavelength offset within the fp - split procedure , there are two effects that can alter the mapping of photocathode points onto given spectral bins .",
    "one of them is a change caused by the doppler - shift correction for orbital motion ( performed internally by ghrs ) .",
    "the extremes of this correction can in principle differ by as much as twice the orbital velocity of approximately @xmath29 times the cosine of the angle of the target with respect hst orbital plane at the time of observation . the other effect , a much smaller one , arises from small changes in the influence of the earth s magnetic field on the trajectories of the electrons traveling from the detector s photocathode to the sensing diodes ( ebbets 1992 ) .",
    "figure  [ demofig ] illustrates the importance of recognizing these shifts and compensating for them in the analysis that eliminates the fixed - pattern noise .",
    "the top panel shows a straight average of the spectra of @xmath3  ori ( i.e. , no attempt to correct for the fixed - pattern noise ) , after shifts had been implemented to compensate for spectral motions with respect to the diodes .",
    "the middle panel shows the outcome for an initial attempt to correct for the fixed - pattern variations by assuming that they remained stationary with respect to the pixel assignments in the accumulated signal transmitted to the ground .",
    "practically no improvement over the simple average is apparent after this correction .",
    "however , one may track the movement of the photocathode by measuring the shifts of one or more particularly strong flaws or , if they are not apparent , by cross correlating the spectra .",
    "after this is done and the spectra have had their fixed - pattern features aligned , an analysis ( with appropriate modifications in the spectral shifts ) produces a satisfactory result ( bottom panel ) .",
    "however , at the point that we declare the pattern to be fixed with respect to the photocathode , we abandon our ability to compensate for differences in response of the detector s diode elements .",
    "( by an extension of the analysis method presented in appendix  [ fpn_analysis ] , it is possible in principle to correct for both sources of variation . )",
    "the fixed pattern removal is beneficial only when the fluctuations are larger than the random noise arising from the counting of photoevents . for each spectrum",
    "a check was made to insure that this condition applied , and , if not , a simple coaddition was performed instead .",
    "there was only one instance ( the coverage of the 1560@xmath23  multiplet of c  i for @xmath2  cyg ) where fluctuations in the fixed - pattern corrected spectrum exceeded those in the simple coadded spectrum , and then by only a small amount .",
    "echelle spectrographs create complex background light patterns arising from scattering from the echelle and cross - disperser gratings ( cardelli , ebbets , & savage 1993 ) .",
    "scattered light corrections supplied by the standard calibrated data products supplied by the space telescope science institute were utilized for the ghrs spectra . for the stis spectrum of @xmath1  del , the characterization of scattered light developed by lindler & bowers ( 2000 ) was invoked by utilizing the calstis reduction procedures developed for the stis investigation team .",
    "since the c  i features toward all of the stars in this survey are weak , errors in the scattered light corrections have a negligible influence on the results .",
    "least - squares fits of legendre polynomials to intensities on either side of the absorption features defined the reference continuum levels for the line measurements .",
    "the procedures of sembach & savage ( 1992 ) were adopted for determining the appropriate order of the polynomial . however , from mock continuum fitting exercises where no interstellar features were present , it appeared that terms in the error matrix for the polynomial coefficients generally underestimated the true uncertainties in the outcomes by about a factor of two .",
    "the additional deviations probably arise from errors in the assumptions that polynomials are truly appropriate for describing stellar continuum levels over arbitrary wavelength intervals .",
    "thus , to account for the uncertainties that are likely to reach beyond the formal errors , the @xmath30 deviations were declared to be really @xmath6 uncertainties .",

    "clearly , the restriction on @xmath121 for @xmath4  lup is not as stringent as for @xmath1  del : a limit @xmath147k arises from the interception of a line corresponding to @xmath148 ( nominal value ) with the expectation @xmath146 .",

    "observations of 21-cm emission and absorption in directions toward extragalactic sources indicate that about half of the h  i in the diffuse medium violates this condition ( heiles 2001 ) .",
    "the data show strong evidence that gas can often be found at temperatures that are intermediate between the two ( positive - slope ) equilibrium curves , an effect that is probably attributable to the effects of mixing of the two extremes in a regime strongly dominated by turbulence ( vzquez - semadeni , gazol , & scalo 2000 ; gazol et al .",
    "on the other hand , the observations generally show that the lowest h  i temperatures coincide with the theoretical expectations .",
    "while broad surveys of emission with superposed absorption highlight a few , selected locations where spin temperatures are below 30@xmath23k ( gibson et al . 2000 ; knee & brunt 2001 ) , the sight lines toward extragalactic sources offer a chance to sample random volumes : the survey of emission and absorption toward these sources reported by heiles ( 2001 ) and heiles & troland ( 2002 ) reveals that only about 3.7% of the cold , neutral medium is at temperatures below @xmath155k . in short ,",

    "alternative means for limiting @xmath121 , such as using the thermal equilibrium curve to define a lower bound and the carbon ionization equilibrium for an upper bound , are indirect and subject to less certain theoretical assumptions .",

    "when three of the stars ( those other than @xmath4  lup ) are examined collectively , they indicate that clouds within the local bubble have thermal pressures in the range @xmath5k .    from the introductory remarks presented in ",
    "[ intro ] , it is clear that the most interesting limit on pressure is the upper one .",
    "any single case is not compelling enough to support the proposal that @xmath156k , since deviations in excess of @xmath157 in a particular direction can be expected to occur 16% of the time .",
    "nevertheless , if one supposes that all clouds within the local bubble have a single representative pressure , it is difficult to imagine that all of the random observational errors would conspire to mislead us to believe that @xmath156k when in reality the pressure is much higher than this value .",
    "the result for @xmath4  lup is not helpful in constraining @xmath123 on the high side , but at least it shows an outcome on the low side that is consistent with those of the other stars . as for systematic errors ,",
    "the only easily identifiable ones are possible errors in the relative @xmath127-values of the c  i and c  i * transitions or errors in the parameters used to develop the predicted values of @xmath61 , such as the collisional rate constants or spontaneous radiative decay rates .",
    "it is apparent from this study that a seemingly large disparity in pressure between neutral clouds embedded in the local bubble and the surrounding hot gas is a general phenomenon and not just confined to the lic around the sun .",
    "possible solutions to the dilemma posed by the apparent pressure imbalance may arise from the following considerations :    1 .   perhaps the clouds have not had enough time to respond fully to a sudden increase in external pressure that happened during the event(s ) that created the lb , perhaps some @xmath158  yr ago ( cox & reynolds 1987 ) . if this is the case , each cloud is in an intermediate condition where a shock is still progressing from the periphery of the cloud , perhaps well outside the portion containing the c  i , to its center .",
    "however , this explanation is not satisfactory for the lic , since the distance from the sun to the closest boundary divided by the sound speed is less than @xmath159  yr .",
    "perhaps magnetic fields within the clouds provide the support needed to counteract the high pressure from the outside .",
    "an upper limit @xmath160 g for the magnetic field just outside the heliosphere ( gloeckler , fisk , & geiss 1997 ) diminishes the attractiveness of this explanation in the case of the lic .",
    "additional contributions to the clouds internal pressures might arise from turbulent motions .",
    "however , the narrowness of the na  i lines observed for @xmath3  ori and @xmath2  cyg lowers the prospects for this proposal .",
    "for instance , if one uses the limit @xmath161 shown in fig .",
    "[ limit_panels ] and assumes the na  i lines are broadened only by turbulence , one finds that @xmath162 and @xmath163k for @xmath3  ori and @xmath2  cyg , respectively .",
    "perhaps the measurements of the thermal pressure for the hot gas in the local bubble were incorrect because they relied on either inaccurate models for the line emission or the assumption that the radiation from the hot plasma is emitted under equilibrium conditions .",
    "for a plasma that is cooling very rapidly , perhaps through adiabatic expansion , the x - rays may come principally from delayed recombinations in cooler gas , rather than collisional excitations at higher temperatures ( breitschwerdt & schmutzler 1994 ) . apart from this theoretical proposal , there have also been persistent difficulties in reconciling measurements of x - ray and euv line emission with models for a hot plasma in collisional equilibrium and with cosmic abundance ratios of the heavier elements ( jelinsky , vallerga , & edelstein 1995 ; mccammon et al .",

    "the latter is recommended over the former if a single , narrow feature is present , with the rest of the spectrum being mostly random noise or much broader features .    as a first step in the analysis , we can reformulate the observed spectrum @xmath165 in terms of its logarithm , so that the mixing of two functions represented by @xmath167 and @xmath166 is a simple linear sum , @xmath171 + \\log[a(\\lambda - \\delta_i)]$ ] . a restriction that should be imposed",
    "is that downward excursions of both @xmath167 and @xmath166 are not very large compared with the average signal levels .",
