    "* axial velocity of vortex front . *",
    "the measurement starts with the container at rest , with vortex - free non - rotating superfluid .",
    "when the container is set into rotation at an angular velocity @xmath6 , a turbulent front forms at the rough surfaces of the heat exchanger at the bottom and starts to move upwards along the cylinder , bringing the superfluid behind it into rotation @xcite .",
    "the axial front velocity @xmath7 is determined from the flight time between two pick - up coils of nuclear - magnetic - resonance ( nmr ) spectrometers .",
    "the energy dissipation rate can be inferred from @xmath7 by considering the free energy difference of the superfluid before and after the front .",
    "the validity of this approach was proven by direct calorimetric measurement of the dissipated heat in the front propagation @xcite .",
    "the rate of the angular - momentum exchange with the bounding walls can be determined either directly from the rotation @xmath8 of the superfluid behind the front or indirectly from the dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath6 .",
    "we first discuss the indirect approach .",
    "the measured axial front velocity is presented in fig .",
    "[ sfv ] as a function of @xmath6 at constant temperature and as a function of temperature at constant @xmath6 . as seen from fig .",
    "[ sfv]a , the @xmath6-dependence of @xmath9 gradually changes from linear @xmath10 towards quadratic @xmath11 with decreasing temperature below 0.3@xmath1 . from fig .",
    "[ sfv]b one finds the limiting behaviour as a function of temperature : at high temperatures the normalized front velocity approaches the @xmath12-independent single - vortex result @xmath13 @xcite and below @xmath14 it appears to level off to a @xmath15-independent but @xmath12-dependent value . here",
    "@xmath16 is the radius of the cylinder and @xmath17 is the dissipative mutual friction parameter , which characterizes the coupling of the normal and superfluid components of @xmath0he - b via scattering of the thermal quasiparticle excitations from the vortex cores @xcite . at the lowest temperatures , the inter - quasiparticle collisions are absent",
    ", the excitations move along ballistic flight paths , and the friction is exponentially reduced as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the superfluid energy gap .",
    "* phenomenological model of front propagation . * the front propagation can be understood using a phenomenological model based on the consideration of energy and angular - momentum balance in the front .",
    "the model relies on the equation of superfluid hydrodynamics averaged over vortex lines @xcite , which is basically the euler equation with an additional friction force from the normal component and a line - tension force owing to the quantum nature of vortices .",
    "the friction force is parametrised with @xmath17 , while the tension - force parameter is @xmath20 , where @xmath21mm / s@xmath22 is the quantum of circulation and @xmath23 mm is the inter - vortex distance . strictly speaking , these equations are applicable only when the vortex lines are locally roughly parallel to each other . to allow an extension to the case of the turbulent front",
    ", we replace the friction @xmath24 with two separate effective friction parameters : @xmath25 when we consider the energy balance and @xmath26 for the angular momentum balance .",
    "these parameters are defined as follows : @xmath27 here @xmath28 , @xmath29 account for the modification of the friction from the normal component owing to the reduced polarization of the vortex lines and their fluctuating motion in the turbulent front . the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 describe the contribution of turbulence and possible effects from residual surface friction .",
    "for simplicity , we consider all four phenomenological parameters to be @xmath32-independent .",
    "analysis of the energy and the angular - momentum balance ( see the supplementary discussion for details ) leads to the following expressions for the front velocity @xmath7 and the angular velocity @xmath8 of the superfluid behind the front : @xmath33 the expression for @xmath7 is a direct generalization of the laminar single - vortex result .",
    "the expression for @xmath8 follows from balancing the azimuthal components of the friction and line - tension forces .",
    "the friction force appears since the azimuthal velocities of the normal and superfluid components differ , while the line - tension force is due to the twisting of the vortices behind the front .",
    "the expression for the front velocity @xmath7 ( eq .  [ model ] ) is compared in figs .",
    "[ sfv]a , b to its measured values in the temperature range , where the mutual friction @xmath17 changes by roughly three orders of magnitude .",
    "the solid lines show the model ( [ model ] ) with the four fitting parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "the temperature dependence @xmath17 is taken from the measurements in ref .",
    "the model seems to be in good agreement with the measurements and in particular , reproduces all the qualitative features of @xmath38 discussed above .     and",

    "( [ model ] ) and are plotted as function of temperature in terms of the measured mutual friction @xmath41 .",
    "the superfluid angular velocity @xmath8 is measured from the precession frequency of the vortex bundle behind the front , with @xmath12 in the range 0.4  1.0rad / s using the method described in ref .",
    "circles denote measurements at @xmath42bar and squares at 29bar .",
    "the solid lines represent eq .",
    "( [ aleff ] ) with the same parameters as used to fit the velocity data in fig .",
    "[ sfv ] . ]    * direct measurement of superfluid angular velocity . * occasional small axial asymmetries in the precessing front and in the bundle behind it cause oscillations in the nmr signal @xcite . in such cases ,",
    "the superfluid angular velocity @xmath8 can be directly extracted from the frequency of the oscillations , albeit usually in a limited range of temperatures slightly above 0.2@xmath1 .",
    "this allows us to determine the angular - momentum coupling parameter @xmath43 independently of the front velocity @xmath7 .",
    "the results shown in fig .",
    "[ aeff ] highlight again the good agreement with the fitted parameter values extracted from fig .",
    "[ sfv ] and the two orders of magnitude difference between @xmath44 and @xmath26 .",
    "this difference and in particular the minute value of @xmath31 emphasize our central result .",
    "when the influence of the normal component on the energy dissipation and coupling to the container walls is excluded , @xmath45 , the residual effective friction parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 should be primarily associated with quantum turbulence in the front .",
    "the relatively large value of @xmath46 shows that turbulence in the front efficiently enhances energy dissipation . for comparison , the same friction from the normal component , @xmath47 , is reached at @xmath48 where the density of the normal component is about 30% of the total liquid density .",
    "the contribution of quantum turbulence to the dissipation in the zero - temperature limit is usually attributed to the energy transfer in the turbulent cascade to length scales much smaller than the inter - vortex distance , where it is dissipated by the emission of non - thermal quasiparticles from the vortex cores @xcite .",
    "the much smaller residual term @xmath49 attests that the angular - momentum transfer from the boundaries is much less effective and that the drag from the superfluid on the boundaries almost disappears in the zero - temperature limit .",
    "it is not clear whether the value of @xmath31 should be completely ascribed to the residual friction in the motion of the surface - attached vortices or whether it has a contribution from turbulence such as momentum transfer from cascading effects similar to those in the energy dissipation or via annihilation of small vortex loops at the surfaces .",
    "there are some arguments , though , in favor of the turbulent contribution .",
    "first , the value of @xmath31 is four times larger than the residual friction term in laminar vortex motion @xcite . also figs .",
    "[ sfv]c and [ aeff ] demonstrate that the same fitted effective friction parameters explain earlier high - pressure measurements @xcite which were conducted in a different quartz cylinder .",
    "we take this to indicate that the model parameters are not strongly dependent on our surfaces or on the pressure - dependent vortex core radius .",
    "to summarize , we find that two separate effective friction parameters have to be introduced to account for energy and angular - momentum transfer respectively . by comparing the measurements to a phenomenological model of turbulent front propagation",
    ", it is seen that these parameters differ by two orders of magnitude .",
    "this difference leads to new physical effects in superfluid dynamics in the @xmath50 limit , such as the recently observed decoupling from the reference frame of the container @xcite .",
    "decoupling of the superfluid and normal components is also discussed , for instance in the evolution of a rotating neutron star when it cools through @xmath51 @xcite , but here in the @xmath50 limit the mechanism of decoupling is different .",
    "it leads to the unusual situation that efficient energy dissipation is achieved in turbulent bulk flow , but the angular - momentum exchange is not enhanced as much beyond that provided by the bulk mutual friction coupling and thus a turbulent boundary layer , similar to that in the classical case , is not formed .",
