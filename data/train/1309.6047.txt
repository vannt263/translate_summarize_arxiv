    "speech enhancement in presence of background noise is an important problem that exists for a long time and still is widely studied nowadays . the efficient single - channel noise suppression ( or noise reduction )",
    "techniques are essential for increasing quality and intelligibility of speech , as well as improving noise robustness for automatic speech recognition ( asr ) systems .",
    "the noise reduction mechanism is designed to eliminate additive noise of any origin from noisy speech .",
    "most often the estimation of speech and noise signal parameters is performed in spectral domain .",
    "the successful example is the minimum mean square error ( mmse ) estimator , which utilizes statistical modeling of speech and noise frequency components @xcite .",
    "one of the most simple and popular approach is spectral subtraction @xcite , where noise spectral profiles are estimated during non - speech segments , and then subtracted from speech segments in magnitude domain .",
    "however this method is restrictive to the quasi - stationarity of the observed noise .",
    "some methods are based on semi - supervised noise reduction , where the target noise signals are presented to train the system .",
    "recently non - negative matrix factorization ( nmf ) had become a widely used tool for making useful audio representations , especially in context of blind source separation @xcite and semi - supervised noise reduction @xcite .",
    "the latest is considered to be a special case of separation problem with additive background noise as secondary source .",
    "nmf factorizes the given magnitude spectrogram @xmath0 into two non - negative matrices @xmath1 where columns of dictionary @xmath2 are magnitude spectral profiles , and @xmath3 contains gain coefficients .",
    "the key steps of semi - supervised nmf - based speech enhancement are 1 ) estimation of noise dictionary @xmath4 from the given training sample , then 2 ) factorizing input spectrogram using speech and noise dictionaries , i.e. @xmath5 and finally 3 ) reconstruct using clean speech magnitude estimation @xmath6 or by using it to filter the initial complex spectrogram . though these simple steps provide good results while reducing non - stationary noise sources @xcite , they do nt consider any additional knowledge about specific signal structure , lacking the interpretability of estimated components and degrading the final performance .",
    "several methods have been proposed to overcome these limitations by introducing regularization probabilistic priors @xcite and constrained nmf procedure for noise estimation @xcite .",
    "the promised results have been achieved by using non - negative hidden markov model framework@xcite that can effectively handle temporal dynamics . in @xcite the regularized nmf problem for speech and music separation is stated .",
    "this method uses normalized sparsity constraints on musical dictionary and gain factors for better discriminating between signals .",
    "however much fewer papers are dedicated to building appropriate constraints on target speech dictionary @xmath7 itself , rather than other nmf components .",
    "most natural constraints should enforce harmonicity of columns . in this paper",
    "we adopt the approach proposed by @xcite in polyphonic music transcription task and further develop it to enhance noisy speech signals .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the first section describes the underlying speech and noise models , which lead to nmf representation with linear constraints of dictionary columns .",
    "the multiplicative updates algorithm is applied to estimate unknown parameters . then the regularized extension of this model is proposed . in the next section experimental evaluations on noisy timit corpus",
    "are given .",
    "in conclusion we discuss about advantages and drawbacks of contributed method .",
    "this section considers speech @xmath7 and noise @xmath4 matrix dictionaries in which columns , or _ atoms _ follow specific linear models that are discussed below .",
    "+      the basic of speech production assumes that the time - domain excitation source @xmath8 and vocal tract filter @xmath9 are combined into convolutive model @xcite : @xmath10 the excitation signal @xmath8 itself could be presented by summing up complex sinusoids and noise on frequencies that are multiples of fundamental frequency @xcite : @xmath11 the quasi - stationarity of the transfer function @xmath9 and fundamental frequency function @xmath12 takes place during the short frame @xmath13 , so that @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "putting together two representations and provides : @xmath16 where the hat symbol indicates fourier transform of the corresponding function .",
    "the approximation of signal in magnitude short - time fourier transform ( stft ) domain using window function @xmath17 is given as : @xmath18 localizes most energy at low frequencies .",
    "then we suppose that frequency response @xmath19 at any frame @xmath20 is modeled by the ( possibly sparse ) combination of fixed spectral shapes with non - negative weights @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath22 . in this case",
    "the final representation formula is : @xmath23 the latest representation could be efficiently wrapped in matrix notation by taking discrete values @xmath24 and @xmath25 , since only one fundamental frequency @xmath26 is expected for the given time frame .",
    "it is possible to choose it from the discrete set @xmath27 of @xmath28 hypothesized fundamental frequencies bounded by @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this leads to @xmath31 possible combinations .",
    "therefore the following equation for the input speech spectrogram @xmath32 holds : @xmath33 each column @xmath34 of matrix @xmath35 represents one _ harmonic atom _ , in which isolated harmonics are placed in columns of matrices @xmath36 , weighted by constant amplitude matrix @xmath37 .",
    "the representation coefficients @xmath38 and gain matrix @xmath39 are needed to be defined .",
    "being not so physically motivated as speech model the noise model of signal is constructed in the similar way by assuming additivity of corresponding spectral shapes ( however this could also be theoretically approved by exploring band - limited noise signals , that is not the case of the current work ) .",
    "each time - varying noise magnitude @xmath40 is decomposed into sum of individual static components : @xmath41 note that @xmath42 is the predefined set of noise magnitudes extracted from the known noise signals , whereas non - negative filter gains @xmath43 should be defined from the observed data . as stated",
    "before the non - negative combination @xmath44 leads to the following representation : @xmath45 and in matrix notation for the same discrete @xmath46 and @xmath47 on input noise spectrogram @xmath48 : @xmath49 with @xmath50 represents noise dictionary with atoms @xmath51 , @xmath52 contains noise spectral shapes combined with unknown coefficients @xmath53 to produce noise model .",
    "here we introduce the general formulation of nmf problem with linear constraints that follows from speech and noise representations .",
    "as soon as spectrograms in both cases factorize by the product of two non - negative matrices , the @xmath54-divergence between observed spectrogram @xmath0 and @xmath55 product could be chosen for approximation @xcite .",
    "here we only consider a special case called kullback - leibler divergence @xmath56 , but other divergences could be used as well .",
    "the following general optimization problem ( _ linnmf _ ) gives solution to and : @xmath57 with minimization over @xmath58 and @xmath3 .",
    "the factors @xmath59 are spanned by the columns of matrices @xmath60 that could be diverse for @xmath61 . using multiplicative updates heuristic @xcite , it could be shown that the following algorithm solves the optimization problem : @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes @xmath64-th row of matrix @xmath3 , @xmath65 is the all - ones matrix and multiplications @xmath66 and divisions @xmath67 are element - wise . by iterating these rules the factors @xmath59",
    "are modeled in linear subspace with dimensionality implied by rank of @xmath60 .",
    "it has been experimentally found that many solutions achieved by tend to  reduce  the rank of corresponding subspace .",
    "in other words , each @xmath59 tends to have sparse representation in basis @xmath60 .",
    "it is not the desired solution in the current task , in case if @xmath60 contains windowed - sinusoid magnitude values on the particular frequency .",
    "as we want to extract full harmonic atoms from signal , it is expected that every harmonic has non - zero amplitude ( especially in low - frequency band ) .",
    "the _ densenmf _",
    "optimization task is proposed to overcome this problem that favors non - zero coefficients in vectors @xmath58 : @xmath68 the following rules are also derived from multiplicative updates for @xmath69-normalized coefficients @xmath70 : @xmath71 where @xmath72 indicates the vector of all - ones of the same size as @xmath73 .",
    "it should be noted that convergence properties of presented algorithms are not studied .",
    "however during the experiments the monotonic behavior of the target function has been permanently observed for arbitrary @xmath74 .",
    "the actual speech enhancement follows the similar procedure as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the initial noise shapes @xmath75 are preliminary extracted from the noise - only magnitude spectrograms .",
    "these shapes are used directly to form noise atoms as in .",
    "harmonic atoms are constructed using fourier transform of hann window shifted on @xmath76 and scaled by @xmath77 that approximates triangle pulse excitation .",
    "this process requires the following parameters to be set :    * the set of hypothesized fundamental frequencies @xmath27 that consists of frequency limits @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and @xmath28 points equally spaced between these limits . as we are going to show in experimental evaluations ,",
    "@xmath28 parameter has drastic effect on noise suppression performance . *",
    "the number of harmonic atoms @xmath78 to be estimated per each hypothesized fundamental frequency . * the number of harmonics @xmath79 .",
    "for each atom @xmath80 is chosen , where @xmath81 is the sampling rate .    the constrained speech and noise dictionaries @xmath7 and @xmath4 are then combined into matrix @xmath82 $ ] , and gain matrix @xmath83^t$ ] is randomly initialized . using iterative updates or all representation coefficients and gain matrices",
    "are obtained using different sparsity parameters @xmath84 and @xmath85 for speech and noise components@xcite@xcite .",
    "finally the denoised signal is made via inverse stft of wiener - filtered input ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "+    figure [ fig : spectrograms ] illustrates the denoised spectrograms of short excerpt of speech contaminated by non - stationary noise . to demonstrate the performance we have tested the proposed nmf - based algorithms on timit corpus @xcite .",
    "1245 sentences from 249 speakers were mixed with various types of non - stationary noises , taken from airport , car , train , babble and street backgrounds .",
    "we have used signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) as objective quality measure @xcite .",
    "four types of input snr are explored : -5db , 0db , 5db , 15db .",
    "the algorithms parameter settings are the following .",
    "the sampling rate of all signals is @xmath81",
    "the stft was applied to noise and noisy signals with 32 ms hanning window and 75% overlap .",
    "then noise matrix @xmath75 with @xmath86 = 16 columns is trained using non - constrained nmf on 10 seconds noise spectrogram of known type of noise .",
    "all atoms @xmath60 are constructed using the following parameters ( see section [ sseq : speech_enhancement ] ) : @xmath29 = @xmath8780hz , @xmath30 = @xmath87400hz , @xmath28 = 33 , @xmath78 = 4 , and @xmath88 = 30 for harmonic atoms , and @xmath89 = 16 for noise atoms",
    ". then _ linnmf _ and _ densenmf _ were applied to input noisy magnitude by doing and by fixing the number of iterations to 25 .",
    "@xmath84 = 0.2 sparsity coefficient was chosen for speech component , and @xmath85 = 0 for noise component according to @xcite . for _ densenmf",
    "_ algorithm the regularization parameter @xmath90 was set to @xmath91 , that was found experimentally .",
    "besides proposed algorithms we have also included two over nmf - based algorithms that serve as baseline .",
    "the first one uses known speech dictionary @xmath7 estimated directly from the same clean signal .",
    "then nmf computes only gain matrices @xmath39 and @xmath92 , followed by the same reconstruction .",
    "this is called _ oracle _ speech enhancement in this evaluations .",
    "the second one , called here _ nmf _ , is also nmf - based noise reduction with unknown speech dictionary @xmath7 which is similar to those described in @xcite and @xcite . also _ mmse _ technique",
    "@xcite has been included as reference , though this algorithm is completely blind .",
    "the figure [ fig : snr - on - timit ] demonstrates the snr performance of proposed algorithms .",
    "it is shown that for low snr _ densenmf _",
    "gives optimistic results , outperforming sometimes even ",
    "_ oracle _  evaluations .",
    "however it is not so surprising because oracle algorithm actually does nt contain any intrinsic speech or noise model , poorly discriminating between both signals . for higher",
    "snr _ densenmf _ starts to perform worse than proposed _",
    "linnmf _ and even than baseline algorithms .",
    "it probably happens due to underestimation of non - harmonic speech components .",
    "finally we have studied how the number of harmonic atoms ( @xmath93 ) and different values of sparsity parameter @xmath84 affect _ densenmf _ noise suppression performance .",
    "ranging @xmath28 from 2 to 100 with @xmath94 , it has resulted to 10 to 500 atoms in total .",
    "we have expected that higher number of atoms would give better results for high sparsity and worse for low sparsity , since the high number of sinusoids tend to overestimate the presented noise .",
    "this expectations are confirmed by the results depicted on figure [ fig : num - vs - sparsity ] .",
    "indeed , for @xmath95 the maximum appears in more dense mixture of harmonic atoms , whereas lesser values of @xmath84 have peaks at @xmath28 around @xmath96 , and then rapidly decrease when more atoms are involved .",
    "note that though setting @xmath97 seems to degrade the overall performance , actually we observed that using this sparsity and high number of atoms gives more audibly pleasant result with much less noise but bit more distorted harmonics , as also could be observed from figure [ fig : spectrograms]d .",
    "hence other objective quality metrics such as in @xcite should be investigated in the future works .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are following .",
    "first we have applied prior deterministic modeling of speech and noise signals inside nmf - based speech enhancement framework .",
    "it has led to linearly constrained columns or atoms of corresponding dictionaries @xmath7 and @xmath4 .",
    "then we have proposed the new optimization problem statement and multiplicative updates algorithm that regularizes the representation coefficients so that they contain as fewer zeros as possible , i.e. , acquiring dense solution .",
    "we have tested the new method on timit corpus mixed with noises on different snr , achieving the best result for low snr among some state - of - the - art noise suppression algorithms @xcite@xcite , and slightly outperforming ",
    "_ oracle _  nmf - estimator with known clean signals .",
    "however , despite the proposed nmf regularizer , most of the extracted speech atoms are still not purely harmonic .",
    "it is a complicated problem in order to develop more efficient speech enhancement method , as well as using these atoms for further analysis .",
    "therefore we will try to put some other nmf constraints that enforce spectral envelope smoothness in time and frequency to achieve more reliable results in future works .",
