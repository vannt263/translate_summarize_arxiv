    "the quality of the model predictions , concerning meson states , was discussed in ref .",
    "figure 1 shows the lowest nucleon and @xmath0 resonances predicted by the model . in the same figure",
    "are shown the calculated penta- and heptaquark low lying states .",
    "for each state we indicate the spin , parity ( @xmath83 ) , and the quark and gluon content ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath84 is the total number of quarks and antiquarks , which is equal to the number of valence quarks ( 0 for mesons , 3 baryons ) plus the number of quarks and antiquarks of the @xmath86-pairs , and @xmath85 gives the number of gluons .",
    "as shown in the figure , nucleonic states contain on the average about half an additional quark - antiquark pair ( equivalent to one extra quark ) , and approximately 2.8 gluons .",
    "this implies a content of 59@xmath87 in the quark sector and of 41@xmath87 in the gluon sector .",
    "the theoretical roper resonance ( first excited nucleon resonance ) lies near the experimental energy of 1.44  gev .",
    "this is a nice feature of the model , which is shared only with the constituent quark model @xcite .",
    "the first negative parity state with @xmath88 appears at 1.51  gev , also in good agreement with the data .",
    "resonances ( second group ) , pentaquarks ( third group ) and heptaquarks ( fourth group ) . on the right side of each level",
    "are given the assigned spin and parity ( @xmath89 ) , and the total quark and anti - quark ( @xmath84 ) and gluon ( @xmath85 ) contents ( see the text),width=340 ]",
    "the simplest way to obtain a @xmath0 resonance is to couple the three valence quarks in the ( 3,0)@xmath90 configuration with @xmath91 pairs in a ( 0,0)@xmath92 configuration .",
    "this scheme leads to the @xmath93 resonance .",
    "the quark - antiquark and gluon content of the calculated @xmath93 turns out to be lower than that of the nucleon , while the structure of the state at 1.57gev can be compared with the roper resonance . concerning negative parity states , fig .",
    "1 shows a @xmath94 state at 1.79  gev . @xmath0",
    "resonances can also be obtained by coupling the three valence quarks in the @xmath95 configuration with @xmath96 @xmath86 states .",
    "the lowest state of this type is at 1.51  gev , and it should be compared with the experimental value ( @xmath0 resonance ) at 1.62  gev @xcite .",
    "in the present calculation the minimal representation of pentaquark - like states includes the following configurations : ( 0,0)@xmath97 , ( 1,1)@xmath97 , ( 3,0)@xmath97 , ( 0,3)@xmath97 and ( 2,2)@xmath97 . only the ( 0,3)@xmath97 and ( 2,2)@xmath97 configurations contains hypercharge and isospin combinations which can not be obtained in a pure @xmath98 coupling scheme , like @xmath99 , @xmath100 in ( 0,3 ) and @xmath101 , @xmath100 in ( 2,2 ) . within the model , the lowest pentaquark state @xmath2 @xcite",
    "is interpreted as a coupling of the three valence quarks in ( 1,1)@xmath102 with the @xmath86 background in ( 1,1)@xmath103 to the final irrep ( 1,1)@xmath97 .",
    "thus , within our model , the calculated pentaquark state at 1.51  gev may correspond to the observed @xmath2 state @xcite .",
    "anther predicted pentaquark state is shown in figure . 1 .    within the model ,",
    "the lowest pentaquark has negative parity in accordance with qcd sum - rules and lattice gauge calculations @xcite .",
    "if the orbital spin @xmath104 is included , pentaquark states with positive parity may exist with @xmath104=1 .",
    "however , these states include an orbital excitation and should appear at higher energies .",
    "the model contains heptaquarks , characterized by two @xmath86 pairs added to the three valence quarks .",
    "the lowest state has an energy of approximately 2.5  gev and it has a content of 3.9 @xmath86 pairs of the type @xmath105 coupled to the three valence quarks in the configuration ( 1,1)@xmath102 . this coupling scheme yields three exotic flavor irreps : ( 3,3)@xmath102,@xmath106 , ( 4,1)@xmath102,@xmath106 and ( 1,4)@xmath102,@xmath106 .",
    "the lowest heptaquark state contains , basically , three ideal valence quarks , four @xmath91 pairs and 4.6 gluons .",
    "this implies a quark content of 70@xmath87 and a gluon content of 30@xmath87 .",
    "the model predicts other heptaquark states at higher energies , which are obtained by coupling the three ideal valence quarks with the @xmath107 and @xmath108 @xmath86 configurations .",
    "this leads to exotic flavor irreps like ( 4,1 ) , ( 1,4 ) and ( 3,3 ) with spin @xmath102 and @xmath106 .",
    "the coupling of the three valence quarks with a @xmath86 irrep ( 2,2 ) @xmath22= 0 , 1 , 2 leads to exotic flavor irreps of the type ( 3,3 ) , ( 1,4 ) with spin - parity @xmath102 , @xmath106 and @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "in this letter we do not go further into the discussion of all possible states with the structure @xmath110 , since the number of these configurations increases with the energy .",
    "a more complete overview of these states will be presented in ref .",
    "@xcite with its complete classification of states .",
    "0.5 cm to conclude , we have applied a schematic model based on qcd degrees of freedom , to describe nucleon and @xmath0 resonances and more exotic penta- and heptaquark states .",
    "the basis states were classified by applying group theoretical methods .",
    "the hamiltonian , used in the calculations , was tested to the mesonic spectrum , nucleon and @xmath0 resonances .",
    "after fixing the parameters in this manner , we have investigated the appearance of penta- and heptaquark states .",
    "the results of the calculations show that the model predicts reasonably well the @xmath111(1540 ) resonance .",
    "the lowest pentaquark state is obtained at an energy of approximately 1.5  gev and it has @xmath89=@xmath97 .",
    "the lowest heptaquark state has an energy of approximately 2.5  gev and @xmath89 either @xmath102 or @xmath106 .",
    "in addition , other penta- and heptaquark states are predicted to appear at higher energies .",
    "the model allows for a complete classification of many quark - antiquark and gluon systems .",
