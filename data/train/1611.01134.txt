    "@xcite is founded on a  counterintuitive fact that some variational approaches may truncate the excited states of such objects with the same or better accuracy than the ground state ( gs ) .",

    ", it is usually a  challenging task to determine whether gs is insulating , metallic , or of a  more complex nature @xcite .",
    "this is primarily because standard gs signatures of the metal - insulator transition , such as a  vanishing charge gap @xcite , are absent at any finite system size ( quantified by the number of lattice sites @xmath4 ) , but may appear only after the so - called finite - size scaling ( with @xmath2 ) , a  procedure introducing systematic errors difficult to estimate in some cases .",
    "for this reason , specially - designed gs correlation functions , not only signalling the mott transition in the thermodynamic limit , but also showing fast convergence ( with @xmath2 ) for finite systems close to the metal - insulator boundary , may constitute a  valuable complement of the existing numerical techniques .    in attempt to propose such correlation functions ,",

    "in this study we have demonstrated that pairwise entanglement , quantified by the fermionic concurrence determined separately for charge and spin degrees of freedom , can serve as a  convenient indicator for a  finite - system version of the mott transition .",
    "in particular , standard finite - size scaling estimates of the mott transition for linear chains of hydrogenic - like atoms are revisited utilizing the exact diagonalization ",
    "ab initio metod ( edabi ) at the half and the quarter electronic filling . in the latter case , we find that not merely the charge gap indicates the transition for @xmath2 ( with @xmath4 being the number of atoms ) at the interatomic distance @xmath182 ( where @xmath183 denotes the bohr radius ) , but also the spin concurrence vanishes for a  finite @xmath4 at @xmath180 taking the values relatively close to @xmath184 .",
    "charge concurrence remains nonzero in both the metallic and the insulating phases , providing a  remarkable illustration of the well - know charge - spin separation phenomenon @xcite .    at the half",
    "filling the mott transition is absent .",
    "instead , the crossover from a  partly localized quantum liquid to a  fully - reconstructed mott insulator is observed .",
    "the charge concurrence vanished at the crossover point , where the spin concurrence shows a  broad peak ; the latter remains nonzero in the entire parameter range .",
    "it is worth to stress here that calculations of the fermionic concurrence , employed in this paper , generate essentially no extra computational costs , as the concurrence is determined solely via pairwise ground - state correlation functions for charge or spin degrees of freedom , without referring to the dynamical properties such as the optical or _",

    "the analytic relations between entanglement and the correlation functions [ see eq .",
    "( [ conc : valx ] ) ] are also derived in this paper .",
    "a  striking feature is that the analysis holds true regardless how the exact ( or approximated ) ground state is obtained , making it possible to apply the entanglement - based signatures of the mott transition when discussing a  generic correlated - electron system .",
    "for this reason , we believe the approach we propose may shed new light on various open problems in the field , such as the long - standing metallization of solid hydrogen @xcite , or the recently - raised phase diagram of the repulsive hubbard model on a  honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
