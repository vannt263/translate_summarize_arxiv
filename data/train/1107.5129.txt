    "casimir effect is a manifestation of the zero - point energy of a quantum field @xcite .",
    "since spacetimes with extra dimensions are fundamental in most of the theories of high energy physics , there have been some intensive activities in investigating the casimir effect in spacetime with extra compactified dimensions @xcite .",
    "the case of scalar fields with dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions or more general robin conditions , and the case of electromagnetic field with perfectly conducting or infinitely permeable boundary conditions have been studied at either zero or finite temperature , for different extra - dimensional spacetimes such as the kaluza - klein spacetime and the randall - sundrum spacetime .",
    "one of the common findings of these works is that on a pair of parallel plates with the same boundary conditions , the casimir force is always attractive at any temperature . for fermionic fields , so far only the zero temperature effect has been investigated in @xcite for extra - dimensional spacetimes with toroidal extra dimensions .",
    "it was found that for a massive fermionic field with mit bag boundary conditions on a pair of parallel plates , the zero temperature casimir force is attractive regardless of the boundary conditions imposed on the compactified dimensions .",
    "the temperature correction to the casimir force of a fermionic field is different from that of a bosonic field .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to investigate whether the casimir force of a fermionic field would stay attractive at any temperature .",
    "the purpose of this work is to answer this question .",
    "the zero temperature casimir effect of fermionic fields in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional minkowski spacetime has been investigated in @xcite for the massless case and in @xcite for the massive case .",
    "the zero temperature effect in minkowski spacetime with arbitrary number of dimensions was discussed in @xcite . the finite temperature correction to the fermionic casimir effect",
    "is less considered . for massless fermions in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional minkowski spacetime ,",
    "it was discussed in @xcite . in this article",
    ", we consider the finite temperature casimir effect of a massive fermionic field in a spacetime of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath2 is the @xmath3-dimensional minkowski spacetime and @xmath4 is a compact @xmath1-dimensional torus .",
    "this will cover the massless case by taking the limit @xmath5 and the case of a minskowki spacetime with arbitrary dimensions by setting @xmath6 or by letting the radii of the torus go to infinity .    in this paper",
    ", we use units with @xmath7 .",
    "as in @xcite , we consider a quantum fermionic field @xmath8 on a ( @xmath9)-dimensional spacetime with @xmath1 compact dimensions of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath2 is the @xmath3-dimensional minkowski spacetime , and @xmath10 is a @xmath1 torus .",

    "the cases @xmath26 for all @xmath27 and @xmath28 for all @xmath27 correspond respectively to untwisted and twisted fields .    in this paper , we consider the finite temperature casimir effect of the fermionic field @xmath8 when it is confined between two parallel plates placed at @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",

    "on the uncompactified directions @xmath45 , there are no boundary conditions and hence @xmath46 .",

    "the expression also shows that in the high temperature ( i.e. , @xmath107 ) limit , the casimir free energy is dominated by the terms with matsubara frequency zero , i.e. , the term @xmath108which is linear in @xmath64 .",
    "this term is called the classical term since it is independent of the planck constant @xmath109 .    to study the low temperature ( i.e. , @xmath110 ) behavior , we need an alternative expression for the casimir free energy which we derive in appendix [ a1 ] .",
    "we find that @xmath111where @xmath112 is the zero temperature casimir energy given by @xmath113and @xmath114 is the temperature correction given by @xmath115 in the case @xmath116 , which happens if and only if the field is massless and untwisted , and @xmath117 , the term @xmath118 is understood as @xmath119therefore , for an untwisted massless fermionic field , the temperature correction contains a term of order @xmath120 .",

    "the asymptotic limits of the casimir force when the separation between the plates is small are computed .",
    "the most important result we obtain in this paper is that the force acting on the plates is always attractive at any temperature and for any boundary conditions assumed on the compact dimensions .",
    "this extends the result obtained in @xcite for the zero temperature case . on the other hand",
    ", we also observe that this result is the same as the case of a scalar field with the same robin condition on both plates @xcite .",
