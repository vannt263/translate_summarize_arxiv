    "in biopolymer synthesis , sequence information is retrieved from a template string and stored in a polymer product .",
    "such template - directed polymer syntheses are exemplified by dna replication and transcription , where catalysts such as polymerase enzymes develop the product polymer along the template with the substrates serving as an energy source as well as material .",
    "the fundamental mechanical characteristics have been extensively investigated from the standpoint of molecular motors  @xcite , and , moreover , recent progress allows the monitoring of the real - time sequencing  @xcite .",
    "one of the remarkable aspects in such polymerization is the selection of a substrate suitable for the template in the presence of thermal random forces , which may induce occasional mistakes .",
    "template - directed synthesis ( tds ) including error occurrence has been explored to give a physical description  @xcite , with a particular focus on developing the nonequilibrium statistical thermodynamics for a sequence match  @xcite and a scheme for lowering the error rate  @xcite .    in a biological system ,",
    "a polymeric sequence is synthesized with a low error fraction , which is estimated as , e.g. , @xmath0 per nucleotides in _ e. coli _ genomic dna  @xcite .",
    "a kinetic proofreading mechanism was proposed to achieve such remarkable fidelity  @xcite . according to this scenario",
    ", a michaelis scheme manages to reduce the error rate with an energy input relative to that in equilibrium . applying multiple steps of repeating these schemes",
    "is expected to increase the correctness of the terminal product . here",
    "the following question arises : using multiple steps reduces the error rate , but does it greatly increase the necessary processing time ?",
    "that is , are the synthesis speed and the accuracy incompatible ? even if an advantage in one conflicts with that of the other , since the production speed and the accuracy are usually gauged by different scales , how should we recognize the balance between them ?",
    "our purpose in the present article is to propose a tds rate that weighs the speed and accuracy on the same scale to discuss the balance between the speed and the accuracy .",
    "the tds rate measures the performance in various kinds of the systems . in the following sections , after giving the tds rate definition , we build two models : ( a ) a jump process model and ( b ) a switching well potential model described by the brownian dynamics .",
    "on the basis of the tds rate , we discuss the balance in these two cases .         on mono element template @xmath1 .",

    "let us consider a tds system .",
    "a template string has @xmath4 code elements , which are arrayed at intervals of @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) along the @xmath7-axis as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the template sequence is @xmath8 , where the elements denoted by @xmath9 are ordered with respect to @xmath10 from @xmath11 .",
    "incorporated / incorporating substrate elements are denoted by @xmath12 paired with template element @xmath9 .",
    "the species number of the code elements is @xmath13 , e.g. , for dna replication , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( complementary base pairs are a - t and g - c ) . in fig .  1 ,",
    "a catalyst , such as dna polymerase , is represented by the ball at @xmath7 ; the catalyst embeds the substrates @xmath16 in the empty slots expressed by  0 \" , starting from the origin . incorporating @xmath12 ,",
    "the entire substrate sequence is denoted by @xmath17 .",

    "the terminal product has the full substrate sequence denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "after the completion , the catalyst is set to go back to @xmath11 with the empty sequence @xmath20 . through many trials ,",
    "we obtain a set of the output probability flows @xmath21 .    here , we discuss what products are more correct through examining the output probability flows . to make the argument clear , let us take the simplest tds system : a binary system , where two substrates ( @xmath22 ) are incorporated into a mono element template , @xmath23 ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "one specific example is a system with substrates @xmath24c , g@xmath25 on template @xmath26 .",
    "conventionally , the combination c - g can be regarded as right , while g - g is regarded as wrong . hereafter , in accordance with right or wrong combinations , the substrates are expressed by @xmath27 or @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the catalyst repeats the same process @xmath4 times so that @xmath28 type sequences are eventually generated in the terminal products .",
    "regarding a physical meaning of right / wrong , we notice that majority or minor of the products should be considered as being right or wrong , respectively .",
    "thus , in this sense , the perfect right flow of the terminal products ( @xmath29 of @xmath30 ) dominates the others .",
    "next , the products for which one wrong and @xmath31 right substrates are incorporated have the second largest flows .",
    "continuing , the flow deceases with increasing numbers of wrong elements @xmath32 embedded in the product sequence . finally , @xmath33 is the least produced .    to advance the argument",
    "further , we can extend the ordering procedure for what products are more correct for general cases ( @xmath34 ) beyond a binary choice .",
    "the @xmath13-substrate system may finally produce @xmath35 type sequences .",
    "if a synthesis system produces @xmath35 sequences at rates @xmath36 , then the correct order is @xmath37 , i.e. , the sequence produced with a higher rate is recognized as being the more correct sequence .",
    "moreover , it is notable that , even if the template is not mono element , but arbitrary , a set of flows are observed , so that the same ordering procedure can be adopted as long as the sequence is fixed .",
    "next let us consider the system performance with a set of the flow @xmath38 @xmath39 by developing the above arguments .",
    "the intuitive features of a tds rate are expected to satisfy the following :    \\(i ) a more biased flow distribution , e.g. , @xmath40 @xmath41 is evaluated as a better tds rate . in the limiting conditions ,",
    "the maximum tds rate is achieved if a single sequence is generated .",

    "condition ( ii ) clearly holds in eq .",
    "( [ infoflow_overd ] ) . to confirm that condition ( i ) holds , let us first consider the best / worst ways to allocate @xmath29 while maintaining the total flow @xmath48 unchanged .",
    "equation  ( [ infoflow_overd ] ) contains a functional form analogous to that of the shannon entropy  @xcite with respect to the flow @xmath29 instead of the probability .",
    "the rate is minimized to @xmath49 by taking an even distribution over all the possible sequences : @xmath50 .",
    "in contrast , the function is maximized to @xmath51 if only one sequence is generated , e.g. , @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "next , to consider intermediate conditions , let us compare two different tds systems , each of which has three sequence products : @xmath54 or @xmath55 .",
    "those flows satisfy the magnitude relation @xmath56 where each system has the same total flows @xmath57 .",
    "the largest flows in the respective systems are the same , in that @xmath58 , but the second largest one in the former system is larger than its counterpart , as @xmath59 . in the criterion of eq .",
    "( [ infoflow_overd ] ) , @xmath42 gives the higher rate to @xmath54 with the second largest flow @xmath60 rather than to the other system .",
    "indeed , the terminal products in @xmath54 are more concentrated on the two sequences @xmath61 , @xmath62 , indicating that the products have a narrower distribution over sequences .",
    "thus , by using the sequence distribution , the tds rate can organize the order in general production systems , which meets condition ( i ) .",
    "we will next apply the tds rate to specific models .",
    "let us first give a simple jump process model in the binary system @xmath2 or @xmath3 like in fig .  2 . for simplicity , we consider that the catalyst at the @xmath10-th site only jumps forward by @xmath5 to the next , i.e. , @xmath63-th , site , while ignoring the backward process .",

    "this means , if the backward process is negligible , then the tds rate is estimated by observing these two velocities .",
    "in addition , conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) introduced as the tds rate definition can be confirmed in eq .",
    "( [ tds_model_a ] ) : for a fixed @xmath71 , the tds rate is maximized when @xmath92 with @xmath93 . in contrast , it is minimized when @xmath49 with @xmath94 .",

    "the flow @xmath95 is clearly enhanced , but the tds rate decreases because @xmath96 under @xmath87 .",

    "the catalysts in this model , such as polymerase , are molecular motors consuming the energy source through the tds reaction . in this section ,",
    "we examine how the tds rate is associated with the energy input by describing the system in terms of brownian motion .",
    "again , we adopt a binary system like that in fig .  2 .",
    "let us look at the step at which the catalyst synthesizes the @xmath10-th substrate .",
    "each incorporating process is captured by the brownian motion in a well potential as in fig .",
    "the potential is indicated by the gray regions on the two sides and the catalyst is first in the left gray region . completing each step",
    "is described by a transfer process from the left- to the right - hand gray regions ( see appendix b for general cases ) .",
    "the potential shape in the middle region reflects the affinity of the @xmath12-@xmath9 combination relying on what substrates ( i ) @xmath72 , ( ii ) @xmath102 are caught in the @xmath10-th region . a motion driven by the consumption of the energy supply is introduced here by applying a fluctuating ratchet model  @xcite . in particular , utilizing the idea of a flashing ratchet model  @xcite , the potentials are switched accompanied by the transition of the internal state between the flat ( @xmath103 : top figure ) and triangle ( @xmath98 : bottom figure ) both for ( i ) @xmath104 and for ( ii ) @xmath32 in fig .",
    "note that the transition takes place stochastically with the rate @xmath105 , and the same substrate @xmath12 is maintained before and after the transition @xmath106 .",
    "the potential shapes are exactly described by @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the substrate sequence with internal state @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",
    "the potentials in the switching region are @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are numerical constants , @xmath115 determines the peak s position in the triangle potential , and @xmath116 is adopted to connect the profile continuously . in the asymmetric shape @xmath117 with @xmath118 and @xmath119 , the catalyst may be driven from left to right gray regions  @xcite .",
    "the difference between @xmath27 and @xmath120 is the peak s position , and @xmath100 and @xmath99 are adopted with the same other parameters ( @xmath101 , etc . ) , so that a rightward motion @xmath27 is larger than that of @xmath120 .",
    "thus , the notation regarding @xmath121 is reasonable from the criterion that the majority is correct .",
    "further , the potential switching to the neighboring sequences ( fig .  3(b ) ) builds up a series of synthesizing steps .",
    "being in the @xmath10-th right - hand gray region of @xmath122 , the catalyst can catch the new substrate and transit to the @xmath63-th left - hand gray region of @xmath123 , where @xmath124 and the new internal states ( @xmath125 ) at the @xmath63-th site are stochastic . on the other hand ,",

    "<S> we propose a template - directed synthesis ( tds ) rate , which contains an expression analogous to that for the shannon entropy . increasing the synthesis speed accelerates the tds rate , but the tds rate is lowered if the produced sequences are diversified . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the tds rate to some production system models and investigate how the balance between the speed and the accuracy is affected by changes in the system conditions .    </S>",
