    "the advent of large cosmological n - body simulations has enabled important progress in our understanding of the structure of dark matter haloes . as a result , over the past few years",
    "a broad consensus has emerged about the mass function of these collapsed structures , about their mass profiles and shapes , and about the presence of substructure within the vitalised region of a halo .",
    "the spherically - averaged halo mass profiles are of particular interest , not only because of their immediate applicability to a host of observational diagnostics , such as gravitational lensing and disk galaxy rotation curves , but also because of the apparent simplicity of their structure .",

    "* hereafter nfw ) argued that the density profile of a dark matter halo may be approximated by a simple formula with two free parameters ; @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the critical density for closure km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 . ] , @xmath10 is a characteristic density contrast , and @xmath11 is a scale radius .",
    "remarkably , this formula seems to hold for essentially all haloes assembled hierarchically and close to virial equilibrium , regardless of mass and of the details of the cosmological model .",
    "the cosmological information is encoded in correlations between the parameters of the nfw profile , so that observational constraints on such parameters may be translated directly into interesting constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "as discussed by nfw , such correlations arise because the characteristic density of a system appears to evoke the density of the universe at a suitably defined time of collapse .",
    "this result has been revisited and confirmed by a rich literature on the topic ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , which has led to the development of a number of semi - analytic and empirical procedures to explain and predict the structural parameters of cold dark matter ( cdm ) haloes as a function of mass , redshift , and cosmological parameters .",
    "the various approaches differ in detail and lead to significantly different predictions , especially when extrapolated to halo masses or to redshifts which were not well sampled by the numerical data on which they were based .",
    "nfw , for example , proposed that the characteristic density is set at the time when most of the mass of a halo is in non - linear , collapsed structures .",
    "* b01 ) , on the other hand , argued that a better fit to their n - body results is obtained by assuming that the scale radius of haloes of fixed virial mass is independent of redshift , leading to a substantially different redshift evolution of the halo structural parameters than envisioned by nfw .",
    "this conclusion was seconded by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ens ) who proposed a modification of b01 s approach to take into account models with truncated power spectra , such as expected , for example , in a warm dark matter - dominated universe .",
    "the predictions of these models also differ significantly for extremely massive haloes , but these predictions have been notoriously difficult to validate since these systems are woefully under - represented in simulations that survey a small fraction of the hubble volume . for example , nfw argued that the characteristic density of a halo is set by the mean density of the universe at the time of collapse .",
    "very massive systems have , by necessity , been assembled quite recently ( indeed , they are assembling _ today _ ) , and therefore they should all have similar characteristic densities .",
    "b01 s model , on the other hand , defines collapse redshifts in a different way , predicting much lower concentrations for very massive objects .    despite the ( qualified ) success of these models at reproducing the _ average _ mass and redshift dependence of halo structural parameters ,",
    "they are in general unable to account for the sizable scatter about the mean relations . as first discussed by @xcite , a sizable spread in concentration ( of order @xmath12 )",
    "is seen at all halo masses , and a number of models have attempted to reproduce this result using semi - analytic models . amongst the most successful are those that ascribe variations in concentration to disparities in the assembly history of haloes of given mass .",
    "for example , ( * ? ? ? * w02 ) identify the scatter with variations in the time when the rate of mass accretion onto the main progenitor peaks .",
    "a similar proposal was advanced by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* z01 ) , who argued that the concentration of a halo is effectively set during periods when the most massive progenitor is in a phase of fast mass accretion .    given the disparities between models , it is important to validate their predictions in a regime different from that used to calibrate their parameters .",
    "indeed , with few exceptions , most of these studies have explored numerically a relatively narrow range of halo mass and redshift , favouring ( because they are easier to simulate ) haloes with masses of the order of the characteristic non - linear mass , @xmath13 , and redshifts close to the present day ( @xmath14 ) . testing these predictions on a representative sample of haloes of mass much greater or much lower than @xmath13 , or at very high redshift ,",
    "requires either simulations of enormous dynamic range , or especially designed sets of simulations that probe various mass or redshift intervals one at a time .",
    "one version of the latter approach was adopted by nfw , who simulated _ individually _ haloes spanning a large range in mass .",
    "the price paid is the relatively few haloes that can be studied using such simulation series , as well as the lingering possibility that the procedure used to select the few simulated haloes may introduce some subtle bias or artifact . recently ,",
    "* m07 ) , have combined several simulations of varying mass resolution and box size in order to try and extend earlier results to @xmath15 scales .",
    "this approach is not without pitfalls , however .",
    "for example , in order to resolve a statistically significant sample of haloes with masses as low as @xmath16 , m07 use a simulation box as small as @xmath17 mpc on a side , leading to concerns that the substantial large - scale power missing from such small periodic realisation may unduly influence the results .",
    "one way to overcome such shortcomings is to increase the dynamic range of the simulation , so as to encompass a volume large enough to be representative while at the same time having enough mass resolution to extend the analysis well below or well above @xmath13 .",
    "this is the approach we adopt in this paper , where we use the _ millennium simulation _",
    "( _ ms _ ) to address these issues",
    ". the enormous volume of the _ ms _",
    "( @xmath18 mpc@xmath19 ) , combined with the vast number of particles ( @xmath20 ) , make this simulation ideal to characterise , with minimal statistical uncertainty , the dependence of the structural parameters of @xmath0cdm haloes on mass , spin , formation time , and departures from equilibrium .",
    "we extend and check our _ ms _ results at low masses by using an additional large simulation of a @xmath21 region with about 10 times better mass resolution .    for reasons discussed in detail below ,",
    "numerical limitations impose a lower mass limit of about @xmath22 in our analysis .",
    "thus , our study does not extend to halo masses as low as those probed by m07 ( whose smallest box is filled with particles of mass @xmath23 ) , but is aimed at extending previous work to give reliable and statistically robust results for large and representative samples of haloes over the full range from @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "the large number of haloes in the _ ms _ also allows us to study in detail deviations from the mean trends and , in particular , the possible presence of systems with unusual properties , such as clusters with unusually high concentrations or galaxy haloes of unusually low density . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the properties of haloes at @xmath1 .",

    "this procedure identifies @xmath51 groups in the _",
    "ms_. we have also used subfind , the _ subhalo finder _",
    "algorithm described in @xcite , in order to clean up the group catalogue of loosely - bound fof structures , and to analyse the substructure within each halo ( see sec .  [",
    "ssec : hsel ] ) .    like fof",
    ", subfind keeps only substructures containing @xmath52 or more particles . in this way , each fof halo is decomposed into a _ background halo _ ( or the most massive `` substructure '' ) and zero or more embedded substructures . in the _",
    "ms _ , subfind finds at @xmath1 a total of @xmath53 substructures , with the largest fof group containing @xmath54 of them .      since much of our analysis deals with radial profiles , it is important to define carefully the centre of a halo .",
    "we choose the position , @xmath55 , of the particle with minimum gravitational potential in the most massive substructure ( the potential centre ) .",
    "although this seems like a sensible choice , it is important to check that other plausible options do not lead to large differences in the location of the halo centre .",
    "we have therefore compared the potential centre with the result of the `` shrinking sphere '' algorithm @xcite , which is intended to converge towards the density maximum of the most massive substructure , independent of the subfind algorithm .",
    "it starts by enclosing all fof particles within a sphere and computes iteratively their centre of mass , shrinking the radius of the sphere by @xmath56 , and rejecting particles outside the sphere .",
    "the iteration stops when the shrinking sphere contains @xmath57 of the initial number of particles .",
    "we carried out this comparison in a sub - volume of the _ ms _ containing @xmath58 haloes with @xmath59 .",
    "for @xmath60 of these haloes the methods agree in the centre position , with a difference smaller than the gravitational softening , @xmath61 .",
    "however , we note that the result can depend on the geometry of the fof group .",
    "when the fof halo is double ( or multiple ) and its centre of mass is far from the centre of the most massive substructure , the shrinking sphere may converge to another slightly less massive substructure .",
    "we conclude that the potential centre is a more robust determination of the halo centre , but that the discrepancy between the two methods could be used to flag problematic haloes whose mass distributions deviate significantly from spherical symmetry .      using the potential centre , we define the limiting radius @xmath62 of a halo by the radius that contains a specified density contrast @xmath63 .",
    "this defines implicitly an associated mass for the halo through @xmath64 we note that this includes all the particles inside this spherical volume , and not only the particles grouped by the fof or the subfind algorithms .",
    "the choice of @xmath65 varies in the literature , with some authors using a fixed value , such as nfw , who adopted @xmath66 , and others , such as b01 , who choose a value motivated by the spherical collapse model , where @xmath67 ( for a flat universe ) , which gives @xmath68 at @xmath1 for our adopted @xmath0cdm parameters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the drawback of the latter choice is its dependence on redshift and cosmological parameters . we keep track of _ both _ definitions in our halo catalogue , but will quote mainly values adopting @xmath69 .",
    "when necessary , we shall specify the choice by a subscript ; e.g. , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the mass and radius of a halo adopting @xmath69 ; @xmath72 and @xmath73 correspond to adopting @xmath68 . unless otherwise specified , quantities listed without subscript throughout the paper assume @xmath69 .",
    "dark matter haloes are dynamic structures , constantly accreting material and often substantially out of virial equilibrium .",
    "in these circumstances , haloes evolve quickly , so that the parameters used to specify their properties change rapidly and are thus ill - defined .",
    "furthermore , in the case of an ongoing major merger , even the definition of the halo centre becomes ambiguous , so that the characterisation of a system by spherically - averaged profiles is of little use . as we shall see below , departures from equilibrium not only",
    "add to the scatter in the correlations that we seek to establish , but can also bias the resulting trends , unless care is taken to identify and correct for the effect of these transient structures .",
    "the equilibrium state of each halo is assessed by means of three objective criteria :    * * substructure mass fraction : * we compute the mass fraction in resolved substructures whose centres lie inside @xmath74 : @xmath75 .",
    "note that in this definition @xmath76 does not include the most massive substructure as this is simply the bound component of the main halo . *",
    "* centre of mass displacement : * we define @xmath77 , the normalised offset between the centre of mass of the halo ( computed using all particles within @xmath73 ) and the potential centre , as @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "* * virial ratio : * we compute @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the total kinetic energy of the halo particles within @xmath73 and @xmath81 their gravitational self potential energy .",
    "to estimate @xmath81 , we use a random sample of @xmath44 particles when @xmath82 .",
    "we obtain physical velocities with respect to the potential centre by adding the hubble flow to the peculiar velocities and then we compute the halo kinetic energy after subtracting from the velocities the motion of the halo centre of mass .",
    "[ fig : pictures ] shows images and spherically averaged density profiles for a set of three haloes of similar mass that are rejected by just one of each of the above criteria .",
    "systems such as the one shown in the top - left panel ( large @xmath76 ) are clearly not relaxed and it is not surprising that the large number of substructures affect halo properties such as concentration , angular momentum and shape @xcite .",
    "note that , despite the large value of @xmath76 , the centre of mass displacement is quite small , since the spatial distribution of substructures happens to be fairly symmetric .",
    "conversely , the halo shown in the upper - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pictures ] has small @xmath76 , but is rejected by our cut on the centre of mass offset @xmath77 .",
    "this is clearly an ongoing merger where , because the merging partner of the main halo lies just outside the virial radius , it contributes little to @xmath76 .",
    "thus the @xmath77 criterion is complementary to @xmath76 .",
    "this is important , because the ability of subfind to detect self - bound substructures is heavily resolution - dependent : @xmath76 is likely to be substantially underestimated in low - mass haloes resolved with few particles .",
    "these two criteria , however , make no use of kinematic information and so our third criterion , based on @xmath79 , is a useful supplement able to reject haloes that , despite passing the other two conditions , are far from dynamical equilibrium .",
    "this is especially the case for ongoing mergers and artificially linked haloes .",
    "an example of a halo rejected by just this criterion is shown in the lower - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pictures ] .    finally , the lower - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pictures ] shows an example of a halo that makes it into our _ relaxed _ sample .",
    "these relaxed haloes generally have smooth density profiles and are well fitted by nfw profiles .      fig .",
    "[ fig : selection ] shows the various correlations between the criteria used to identify `` relaxed '' haloes ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath79 ) and the number of particles within the virial radius .",
    "note that the equilibrium measures we use do not have bimodal distributions , but , instead , are roughly continuous , with extended tails .",
    "this reflects the fact that haloes assemble hierarchically : all haloes are in the process of accreting some material and are , therefore , to some extent unrelaxed .",
    "( note for example , that the median @xmath79 is slightly greater than unity , as reported in earlier work ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , our selection criteria just provide a simple , but somewhat arbitrary , way of trimming off the tail of worst offenders , typically ongoing mergers .",
    "the shaded regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : selection ] show the areas of parameter space rejected by our criteria to select _ relaxed _ haloes : @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the top - right panel shows the expected strong correlation between our measures of asymmetry and lumpiness , as well as how the tail of high @xmath77 and high @xmath76 values is removed by the selection .",
    "of all the selection criteria , the one most sensitive to the number of particles in the halo is @xmath76 .",
    "this is clearly seen in the top - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : selection ] , where the stepped line shows , as a function of @xmath86 , the fraction of haloes with no resolved substructures , i.e. , @xmath87 .",
    "this rises quickly with decreasing @xmath86 , so that more than @xmath88 of haloes with @xmath89 particles have no discernible substructures .",
    "by contrast , essentially _ all _ haloes with more than @xmath90 particles have at least one massive subhalo within the virial radius .",
    "a significant fraction of haloes with fewer than @xmath44 particles also have very large values of the virial ratio @xmath79 , as shown in the bottom - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : selection ] . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "these are loosely bound objects connected by a tenuous bridge of particles , or objects lying in the periphery of much more massive systems that owe their large kinetic energy to contamination with fast - moving members of the other system .",
    "these results suggest that a minimum number of particles may also be required in order to obtain robust results independent of numerical artifact .",
    "we shall see below that about @xmath91 particles or more are needed in order to avoid biases when deriving structural parameters from fits to the halo mass profiles .",
    "the fraction of haloes rejected by these cuts varies slowly with mass , rising from 20% at @xmath92 to 50% at @xmath93 ( see numbers given in fig .",
    "[ fig : massc ] and table  [ tab : fits ] ) .",
    "the criterion @xmath84 rejects the most haloes ; a smaller but significant fraction of haloes that pass that cut are removed by the @xmath83 criterion ; while only a few additional haloes are rejected by the @xmath85 test .",
    "we use the merger trees for the _ ms _ described in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these differ slightly from those used by @xcite , but the differences are only significant for haloes undergoing major mergers , which would not pass the stringent selection criteria listed above . at each of the approximately @xmath94 output redshifts of the simulation , the merger tree provides us with a list of all the haloes that will subsequently merge to become part of the final halo .",
    "we exploit this information below in order to investigate the dependence of halo concentration on formation history ( see section  [ ssec : cpred ] ) .",
    "= 8.0truecm      for each halo identified using the procedure outlined in section  [ ssec : hid ] we have computed a spherically - averaged density profile by binning the halo mass in equally spaced bins in @xmath95 , between the virial radius and @xmath96 .",

    "[ eq : rms ] assigns equal weight to each bin .",
    "we have explicitly checked that none of our results varies significantly if we adopt other plausible choices , such as poisson weighting each bin ( for further discussion , see @xcite ) .",
    "once the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 for each halo are retrieved from the fitting procedure , they may be expressed in a variety of forms . in order to be consistent with the original nfw work ,",
    "we choose to express the results in terms of a mass , @xmath70 , and a concentration , @xmath101 , that result from adopting @xmath66 in the definition of the virial properties of a halo ( eq .  [ eq : rvir ] ) .",
    "the radial range adopted for the fitting procedure is important , especially since haloes of different mass are resolved to varying degree in a single cosmological simulation . after experimenting at length , and especially after comparing the fit parameters obtained in the overlapping mass range of the two simulations ( section  [ ssec : ms ] ) , we settled on carrying out the fits over a uniform radial range ( in virial units ) .",
    "this ensures that all haloes , regardless of mass , are treated equally , minimising the possibility of introducing subtle mass - dependent biases in the analysis .",
    "fig  [ fig : resolution ] shows the mass - concentration dependence obtained for the _ ms _ ( symbols ) and the higher mass resolution simulation ( lines ) for four different choices of the radial range .",

    "note that , provided the minimum radius is @xmath103 , the fit parameters appear to depend only weakly on the radial range , but that the distribution of concentrations is narrowest for @xmath104 . for this choice ( which we adopt hereafter in our analysis )",
    "there is also good agreement between the two simulations on mass scales probed in both with at least @xmath44 particles .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : crms ] , the mean quality of the fits , as measured by @xmath105 , deteriorates noticeably for haloes with less than @xmath90 particles as a result of the relatively small number of particles per bin . although this does not seem to introduce a bias in the mass - concentration relation , we have decided to retain , conservatively , only haloes with @xmath106 for our analysis , and to combine the two simulations in order to probe the halo mass range @xmath107 .",
    "finally , we considered a couple of alternative methods for characterising the halo concentration that do not assume an nfw density profile , such as the ratio of maximum to virial circular velocities , @xmath108 @xcite or the ratio of masses enclosing different overdensities , such as @xmath109 @xcite .",

    "we use this to check the common assumption that , at given halo mass , concentrations are distributed following a lognormal distribution @xcite .",
    "we examine this in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter ] , where we show the distribution of concentrations in two mass bins . in each panel",
    "the top histogram corresponds to _ all _ haloes in our sample , and the lower histogram only to those deemed _",
    "relaxed _ by the criteria listed in section  [ ssec : hsel ] .    although the overall distribution is _ not _ approximated well by a lognormal function , that of _ relaxed _ haloes is .",
    "the thick lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter ] show fits of the form @xmath125 ,   \\label{eq : lognormal}\\ ] ] which is clearly a good approximation for the concentration distribution of relaxed haloes .",
    "intriguingly , the concentration distribution of `` unrelaxed '' haloes may also be approximated by a lognormal distribution , albeit of smaller mean and larger dispersion , as shown by the dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter ] .",
    "the sum of the two lognormals ( shown with dashed lines ) is indeed a very good approximation to the overall distribution .",
    "we list the median concentration and dispersion of these distributions , as well as the fraction of `` unrelaxed '' haloes , as a function of mass in table  [ tab : fits ] .    upon inspection ,",
    "a weak but systematic trend is apparent in table  [ tab : fits ] : the _ dispersion _ in concentration appears to decrease monotonically as a function of mass ( see also the bottom panel of fig  [ fig : fracscatter ] ) .",
    "this suggests that massive haloes are somehow a more homogeneous population than their lower mass counterparts , and may reflect the fact that massive haloes are rare objects that have collapsed recently , whereas less massive systems have a much wider distribution of assembly redshifts .",
    "we shall return to this topic below .",
    "one may apply the distributions shown in fig  [ fig : scatter ] to estimate the abundance of relatively rare objects .",
    "these might be , for example , massive cluster haloes of unusually _ high _ concentration that stand out in x - ray or lensing surveys , or perhaps galaxy - sized haloes of unusually _ low _ concentration which may be notable because of peculiarities in the rotation curves of the galaxies they may host .",
    "we show this in the top and middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fracscatter ] , where the `` plus '' signs denote the fraction of haloes in each mass bin that have @xmath126 .",
    "the diamond symbols , on the other hand , indicate the fraction of systems with concentrations _ exceeding _ @xmath127 .",
    "for example , we find that slightly more than @xmath57 of _ relaxed _ haloes with @xmath128 have @xmath129 , or about @xmath130 objects in our @xmath18 mpc@xmath19 volume . so clusters such as abell 1689 , for which @xcite estimate @xmath131 should not be very abundant in the local universe .",
    "finding , through lensing or x - ray studies , many clusters as massive and as concentrated as abell 1689 would yield strong constraints on the viability of @xmath0cdm as a cosmological model .",

    "the top histogram in each panel shows the distribution for all haloes , the lower histogram that corresponding to the _ relaxed _ halo sample .",
    "the smooth curves are lognormal fits .",
    "note that the overall distribution may be very well approximated by the sum of two lognormal functions with parameters listed in table  [ tab : fits].,width=340 ]     ( plus sign symbols ) and @xmath133 ( diamond - like symbols ) .",
    "the points connected by solid lines are the direct measurements , in mass bins .",
    "error bars denote @xmath134 uncertainties .",
    "the lower panel shows the measured rms scatter in @xmath135 for _ all _ and _ relaxed _ haloes , respectively.,width=340 ]      although models such as those proposed by nfw , b01 or ens may more or less account for the weak correlation between mass and concentration , they say little about the origin of the sizable scatter about the mean trend . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter ] , haloes of given mass have concentrations that may differ by up to a factor of three or more . what is the origin of this large scatter ?",
    "one possibility is that concentration may be related to the angular momentum of the halo and that the large scatter in the spin parameter at given mass ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) is somehow related to the spread in concentration .",
    "this was explored by nfw and b01 , who concluded that there was no obvious correlation between spin and concentration ; however , @xcite have recently argued that such correlation indeed exists , and speculate that this may explain why low surface - brightness galaxies ( lsbs ) appear to inhabit low - density haloes @xcite .",
    "we revisit this issue in fig .",
    "[ fig : cspin ] , where we show the spin parameter @xmath136 ( where @xmath137 is the angular momentum with respect the potential centre and @xmath138 is the binding energy of the halo ) versus concentration for our full halo sample ( top panel ) and for _ relaxed _ haloes ( bottom panel ) .",
    "although the full halo sample shows a well - defined tail of low - concentration , fast - spinning haloes reminiscent of @xcite s claim , this essentially disappears when _ relaxed _ haloes are considered .    as discussed above ,",
    "the low concentrations of unrelaxed haloes measured by profile - fitting algorithms are a transient result of the rapidly evolving mass distribution that accompanies an accretion event , and do _ not _ indicate a halo with lower - than - average density .",
    "however , this observation does not explain why , as is apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : cspin ] , unrelaxed systems also tend to have , on average , higher spins than their relaxed counterparts .",
    "as argued recently by @xcite , this is likely due to the redistribution of mass and angular momentum that occurs during mergers , combined with the arbitrary virial boundaries used to define a halo and to compute its spin .",
    "accretion events bring mass and angular momentum into a system , but redistribute it in such a way that high - angular momentum material ends up preferentially on weakly bound orbits that may take it beyond the nominal virial radius , thereby reducing @xmath139 .",
    "this effect seems to be particularly important during mergers , and leads to an overall reduction of @xmath139 as the merger progresses ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude , in agreement with m07 , that the bulk of the effect reported by @xcite is due to the inclusion of out - of - equilibrium haloes in their sample .",
    "a very weak correlation between @xmath140 and @xmath139 may be visible in the tilt of the contours in the _ relaxed _ halo panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cspin ] , but it seems too weak to have strong observational implications .",
    "the mass - concentration dependence was originally interpreted by nfw as the result of the dependence of halo formation time on mass : the halo characteristic density just reflects the mean density of the universe at the time of collapse .",
    "therefore , low - mass haloes are more concentrated because they collapsed earlier , when the universe was denser .",
    "nfw also showed that the bulk of the scatter in the concentration at given mass is due to variations in formation redshift . in this section",
    "we revisit the nfw analysis using our simulations .",
    "the first thing to note is that there is no unique way of defining when a particular halo formed , and so different definitions have been adopted @xcite .",
    "the simplest and most widely used definition is to set the formation redshift of a halo as the time when the most massive progenitor first exceeds half of the final halo mass , @xmath141 .",
    "we use this as our default definition , but we will also consider other variants below .    fig .",
    "[ fig : zf_mass ] shows the dependence of the formation redshift ( expressed as @xmath142 ) on halo mass . as expected , the median formation redshift clearly declines with increasing mass , and the solid line in the figure shows a least - squares fit to the median concentration .",
    "dots show a random selection of haloes coloured according to their concentration .",
    "the gradual change in colour from top to bottom indicates that concentration and formation time are closely related .",
    "we investigate this further in fig  [ fig : residuals_zf ] , where we plot the offset in concentration from the mean mass - concentration relation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : massc ] ) versus the formation redshift offset from the mean mass - formation redshift relation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zf_mass ] ) for two mass bins .",
    "the strong correlation between residuals indicates that the scatter in concentration at fixed mass is mostly due to variations in formation time .",
    "the fraction of the scatter in concentration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter ] , @xmath143 , accounted for by @xmath144 variations may be estimated by comparing it with the rms scatter , @xmath145 , about the 1:1 line in fig .",
    "[ fig : residuals_zf ] . the fractional reduction in the variance",
    ", @xmath146 is @xmath147 for the lowest mass range , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 for the highest mass range , @xmath150 .",
    "this implies that the scatter in concentration is not fully explained by differences in formation time alone , and that additional effects are at work .",
    "one possibility is that the additional scatter is an environmental effect , as recently proposed by @xcite .",
    "however , these authors find that the effect is restricted to low - mass haloes , whereas our results show additional scatter for high mass haloes as well .",
    "another possibility is that our formation time definition should be revised .",
    "after all , the fraction of halo mass enclosed within the scale radius , @xmath11 ( which defines @xmath140 ) , is _ much less _ than one - half of the halo mass for the typical concentrations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : massc ] . or",
    ", finally , it might be that the scatter is driven by some aspect of the merger history that is not fully captured by our default definition of @xmath151 , which depends on a single component of the halo ( its most massive progenitor ) rather than on the full spectrum of fragments that coalesce to form the final halo .",
    "we explore this in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatterzf ] , where we compare the nfw characteristic density , @xmath10 , with four different definitions of the formation redshift .",
    "we use @xmath10 in this figure because , besides being equivalent to the concentration , @xmath140 , it is easier to interpret . indeed ,",
    "if the characteristic density really tracks the mean density of the universe at the time of formation , one would expect it to follow the `` natural '' scaling , @xmath152 .",
    "three of the @xmath144 definitions explored in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatterzf ] are variations of the one adopted above , and indicate the time when the most massive progenitor first exceeds 10 , 25 , and 50% of the final halo mass , @xmath153 .",
    "these correspond to the panels labelled @xmath154 , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatterzf ] , respectively .",
    "the last definition , on the other hand , follows the prescription of nfw , and identifies the time when the _ combined mass _ of all @xmath157 progenitors exceeds @xmath156 .    as is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : scatterzf ] , the tightest relation around the `` natural scaling '' ( shown as solid lines ) corresponds to the nfw definition .",
    "this suggests that the full mass spectrum of clumps that assembles into the halo plays an important role in the final halo concentration and not just the most massive progenitor .",
    "we also note that in each panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : scatterzf ] it is the first ( lowest redshift ) bin that has the largest scatter and that is furthest form the  natural scaling \" relation .",
    "this bin corresponds to haloes that have been assembled very recently , and may contain haloes that , despite our selection criteria , are still unrelaxed and for which the structural parameters are ill defined .    ) versus formation - time offsets from the mean mass - formation time relation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zf_mass ] ) for two mass bins , as labelled in each panel .",
    "the strong correlation between residuals implies that much of the scatter in the @xmath158-@xmath140 relation is due to variations in the formation time of haloes of given mass .",
    "boxes indicate the median and ( 25,75 ) percentiles , whiskers stretch to the ( 5,95 ) percentiles . the number of haloes in each @xmath159 bin is given in the legend.,width=340 ]      it is clear from the above discussion that accurate predictions of the concentration require some knowledge of the halo s assembly history .",
    "this cautions against the common practise in semi - analytic models of assigning concentrations to haloes according to just their mass and to some probabilistic accounting of the dispersion shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter ] . as emphasised by @xcite",
    ", properties such as the clustering of haloes depend on the assembly history , so a full description of the correlation between formation history and concentration may affect significantly the model predictions for the size and internal structure of a galaxy .    a couple of prescriptions designed to predict halo concentrations at @xmath1 from their mass accretion histories have been proposed recently ( w02 , z03 ) , and we use our simulation merger trees in order to compare them .",
    "we focus on the _ relaxed _ halo sample , since these have well - defined concentration parameters .",
    "we also compare these methods with the simple prescription originally proposed by nfw .",
    "w02 showed that the mass accretion history ( mah ) of a halo s most massive progenitor , of mass @xmath160 at redshift @xmath1 , may be approximated by a simple function , @xmath161 i.e. , by a straight line with slope @xmath162 in the plane @xmath163 vs. @xmath164 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these authors then relate the parameter @xmath165 to a formation time via @xmath166 .",
    "their fig .",
    "6 shows that this definition of formation time correlates well with the halo concentrations measured by b01 in their simulations and can be used to predict @xmath140 at @xmath1 .    fitting this correlation",
    ", they find @xmath167 with @xmath168 , the typical concentration of haloes forming at the present time .",
    "the implementation of this prescription in our simulations is straightforward , and we show the predictions in fig .",
    "[ fig : predictions ] , after recalibrating eq .",
    "[ eq : wcal ] with @xmath169 in order to take into account our different definition of virial radius .",
    "z03 differentiate two distinct phases in the mah ; one of early , fast accretion , followed by a slow - accretion period that lasts until the present .",
    "the transition between the two phases occurs at a characteristic redshift , @xmath170 .",
    "this `` turning - point '' redshift may be used to estimate the concentration , assuming that the inner properties of the halo , such as the scale radius , @xmath11 , and its enclosed mass , are set at @xmath170 and vary weakly thereafter .",
    "this procedure is in principle straightforward to implement in our simulations but we note that there are a substantial number of haloes for which the distinction between the two accretion phases is not well - defined . in some cases , more than one phase of fast accretion seems to be present ; in others , there is a single phase with no obvious turning point .",
    "this leads to ambiguities in the definition of @xmath170 and its associated concentration that are not easily resolved and that affect a significant fraction of haloes .",
    "a similar worry applies to the wechsler et al prescription , since eq .",
    "[ eq : wechsler ] is a poor approximation to the mah of a significant number of systems .      finally , we consider nfw s proposal to identify the formation redshift with the epoch when @xmath171 of the halo is contained in progenitors more massive than certain fraction , @xmath172 , of the final halo mass .",
    "nfw propose @xmath173 in their original work in order to match the mass - concentration relation using the extended press - schechter formalism , but this fraction is too low to allow for an accurate estimate in n - body simulations . as a compromise , we adopt @xmath174 for the results shown here .      note that the three prescriptions described above are based on different features of the halo merger trees . while nfw looks at the mass spectrum of clumps containing half of the final halo mass , the other methods consider just the mah of the most massive progenitor .",
    "the z03 prescription depends on the slope of the scaling relation @xmath175 vs. @xmath176 in the slow accretion phase while the w02 recipe fits the whole mah with a single slope .    in spite of these differences , fig .",
    "[ fig : predictions ] shows that all three procedures yield concentrations that correlate reasonably well with the measured values .",
    "the rms scatter between prediction and measurement is indicated in each panel .",
    "it is smallest ( marginally ) for the nfw prescription , but even in this case it only reduces the scatter in the mass - concentration relation ( fig .  [ fig : massc ] ) from @xmath177 to @xmath178 .",
    "thus it only accounts for about 30% ( @xmath179 ) of the variance in the mass - concentration relation .",
    "the w02 prescription does similarly well by this measure , but the slope of the @xmath180@xmath181 relation is a bit too shallow .",
    "the z03 prediction has more scatter , but this is entirely due to a tail of haloes for which it predicts very low concentrations .",
    "we conclude that all three methods predict concentrations that correlate well with the measured values , but none of them is able to fully account for the scatter in the mass - concentration relation .",
    "-values indicated in each panel give the rms scatter in the prediction @xmath182 , while @xmath143 is the corresponding rms scatter about the mass - concentration relation for the same set of haloes.,width=302 ]",
    "we use the _ millennium simulation _ to examine the structural parameters of dark matter haloes formed in the @xmath0cdm cosmogony . the large volume probed by the _ ms _ , together with its unprecedented numerical resolution , allow us to probe confidently the mass profiles of haloes spanning more than three decades in mass .",
    "our main conclusions may be summarised as follows .    * as in earlier studies , we find that the mass profile of dynamically _ relaxed _ haloes are well approximated by the two - parameter nfw profile .",
    "we find that at least @xmath44 particles are needed in order to obtain unbiased estimates of the distribution of halo concentrations and illustrate a number of potential pitfalls that arise from analysing poorly - resolved haloes , or from including in the sample haloes manifestly out of equilibrium .",
    "* we study the correlation between the nfw fit parameters , which we express in terms of the halo mass and a concentration parameter .",
    "these results extend previous studies to much larger halo masses than hitherto reported in the literature . combining our results with those of @xcite",
    ", we find that a single power law reproduces the mass - concentration relation for over six decades in mass .",
    "these results are in reasonable , albeit not perfect , agreement with the predictions of the @xcite and nfw models .",
    "the model of @xcite fails at large masses , and predicts concentrations at least a factor of @xmath183 too low for @xmath184 haloes . *",
    "the dependence of concentration on mass , while well established , is weak , and of equal importance is the broad scatter in concentration at fixed mass .",
    "the distribution of concentrations at given mass is well fitted by a lognormal function where _ both _ the mean and the dispersion decrease with increasing halo mass .",
    "these results allow us to estimate in detail the abundance of haloes with unusually low or unusually high concentration , providing a well - defined prediction that may be used to interpret observations of objects of unusual density , such as highly - effective cluster lenses or galaxies with haloes of anomalously low density . *",
    "we find that , once _",
    "haloes are excluded , there is no significant correlation between halo spin and concentration , contrary to the results of @xcite .",
    "* we have searched for several ways to account for the large dispersion in concentrations at given mass .",
    "the scatter in concentrations seems to arise largely due to variations in the formation time .",
    "we examined various plausible definitions of the formation time , and find that concentrations are best predicted by formation times defined taking into account the collapse history of the full spectrum of progenitors rather than the evolution of the single most massive progenitor .",
    "* we compare the schemes of @xcite , @xcite , and a variant of the nfw prescription , and find that , while all three show a strong correlation between the predicted and measured concentrations , considerable scatter remains .",
    "in fact , none of these models is able to account for more than 30% of the intrinsic variance in the mass - concentration relation .",
    "it appears as if a large fraction of the scatter is truly stochastic or , else , dependent on aspects of the halo merger history that are not probed by these simple schemes .",
