    "dust is the cornerstone of the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) unified scheme that postulates that the diversity of the observed properties of agn are merely a result of the different lines of sight with respect to obscuring material surrounding the active nucleus ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the elements necessary for understanding the nature of agn and the variety of their properties are in fact the geometry of the circumnuclear dust and the amount of obscuration .",
    "the latter is also needed in order to understand the physical conditions of the dust enshrouded nuclear region and to estimate the intrinsic uv - to - optical properties of the agn .",
    "obscuring dusty material should re - radiate in the infrared ( ir ) the fraction of accretion luminosity it absorbs , providing thus a direct metric for the study of the medium .",
    "indeed all spectroscopically confirmed agn lying in regions covered by the various spitzer space telescope ( spitzer ) surveys show significant ir emission down to the detection limits .",
    "the conventional wisdom is that dust , distributed in a more or less toroidal form around the nucleus , mainly consists of silicate and graphite grains , leaving unmistakable signatures in the observed seds of agn .",
    "the most important dust features are the t@xmath101500 black - body like rise of the ir emission at @xmath11 , corresponding to the sublimation temperature of the graphite grains and the @xmath129.7 micron feature in emission / absorption attributed to silicates .",
    "while silicates in absorption were already long ago observed in a variety of type 2 objects , iso observations only provided faint indications of their presence in emission in the spectra of type 1 , challenging the unified scheme , as all smooth torus models predicted a feature in emission for the unobscured agn .",
    "clumpy models , on the other hand , provided a natural attenuation of the feature @xcite .",
    "observations of tens of objects carried out with the irs spectrograph onboard spitzer allowed , however , the detection of the silicate feature ( first reported by @xcite and observed by several others since ) predicted by smooth tori models in emission for type 1 agn and quasars ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus far , there is no consensus on the dust distribution among astronomers ; for an overview of the issues involving the two approaches see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "until very recently the number of spectroscopically confirmed type 2 agn was rather limited ; in the last few years however , the advent of large - scale multi - wavelength surveys has led to a revolution in agn studies .",
    "we are now in a position to compile statistically large type 2 agn samples at all redshifts , selected in a multitude of ways . in this work",
    "we try to characterise the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of type 2 agn using the smooth torus models described in @xcite and the methodology described in @xcite , hereafter paper 1 , in which we dealt with the ir properties of quasars .",
    "the aim of the present work is to model a large sample of type 2 agn and , by comparison with the results derived from the study of type 1 quasars in paper 1 , test the unified scheme .",
    "the various type 2 agn samples will be discussed in detail in section [ sec : data ] .",
    "section [ sec : seds ] will briefly describe the various model components as well as the basics of the standard @xmath2 minimisation technique and assumptions .",
    "the results on the individual samples will be presented in section [ sec : fitresults ] while the combined results from all samples , including the quasars ( typical representatives of type 1 agn ) from paper 1 , will be shown in section [ sec : combi ] .",
    "a final discussion on the future of such studies is presented in section [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "in this work we will be analysing a variety of type 2 agn samples , namely a low redshift , low luminosity agn sample , an x - ray and radio selected sample in the cosmos field and a mid - infrared ( mir ) selected sample from the elais fields",
    ". we will be also revisiting the sdss / swire quasar sample studied in paper 1 ( hereafter quasar sample ) .",
    "the low - luminosity low - redshift agn sample , hereafter low-@xmath7 sample , is part of an updated version of an emission line galaxies sample classified as agn .",
    "the selection was made among hundreds of thousands of emission line galaxies from the sdss data release 4 ( dr4 ; @xcite ) , based on the relative strength of the emission lines on a log(/h@xmath13 ) - log(/h@xmath14 ) diagram , after careful subtraction of the stellar continuum , described in detail on @xcite . from the more than 80,000 proposed agn ,",

    "from the 388 ( 340 with an additional 24 detection ) objects , 155 ( 146 ) and 88 ( 81 ) were additionally detected by mips at 70 and 160 , respectively .",
    "the far - infrared ( fir ) measurements characterize or constrain ( with upper limits ) the cold dust emission .    due to the nature of the sample",
    ", particular care was taken in the construction of the seds .",
    "we used data from the sdss dr4 , 2mass including the deeper data set 2mass @xmath15 6 taken in the lockman field @xcite , as well as ir data from swire .",
    "for extended objects ( based on the sdss classification ) we used petrosian @xmath1 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath7 magnitudes , 7 `` radius magnitudes for 2mass @xmath19 , and aperture 5 fluxes ( 5.8 '' radius ) , the largest publicly available irac aperture , for the four irac bands , to better capture the total light arising from the resolved host galaxies .",
    "the 5 `` 2mass magnitudes , closer to the 5.8 '' aperture selected for the irac bands , were proven to be inadequate when all the seds were visually inspected as they were clearly falling short of both the sdss and the irac fluxes . for the point sources we used psf sdss magnitudes , default ( psf ) 2mass magnitudes and aperture 2 ( 1.9 \" ) irac magnitudes ( for a full description of the swire magnitudes and their adequate for point - like and extended sources see @xcite ) .",

[",
    "fig : compare_props ] .",
    "we therefore conclude that we either are unable to detect the signature of agn with @xmath22erg / sec or that the criteria used by @xcite to select agn were too generous and many objects with no nuclear activity may have made it into the suggested agn sample .",
    "another issue to consider is the distribution of the resulting covering factor , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kauffcf ] . were the computed values for cf correct",
    ", they would translate to a ratio of type2:type1 objects of about 1:1 in the local and low-@xmath7 universe , a much lower value than that observed .",
    "this discrepancy could again be seen as a result of the agn candidate selection and the somewhat sparse samples of the observed seds , the combination of which does not always allow the fitting code to give robust results .    allowing for torus models with @xmath23 does not have any effect on the results , as only 18 out of the 388 objects where better fit by a model including such a torus component , with a single one among them assigned a @xmath24 .",
    "the ssps used to reproduce the blue part of the seds provide information about the stellar mass of the host galaxy . to compute the stellar mass we exploit the fact that ssp spectra are given in luminosity units per one solar mass .",
    "we also account for the fact that a certain percentage of stars , depending on the ssp s age , has evolved and is not shining anymore , so the mass value we provide is actually `` luminous mass '' , fig .",

    "the average sfr of the entire sample without imposing a cut on the @xmath2 values is of 2.8 @xmath30/yr , and drops to 2.2 when only objects with @xmath31 are consider , and to 1.85 when objects with an agn component are excluded .",
    "note that all objects with a torus component are gathered in the part of the histogram with the higher srfs .",
    "we will get back to the discussion on sfrs in section [ sec : sfr ] .",
    "the spectroscopic sample of x - ray emitters selected in the cosmos field presented in @xcite comprises 80 type 2 agn , 47 type 2 agn and red galaxy hybrid and 8 type 2 agn whose classification is not 100% secure .",
    "ninety two out of these 135 objects have a 24 micron counterpart and , as already mentioned in section [ sec : data ] , we will be concentrating on this sub - sample alone .",
    "this was not a constraint applied to the low redshift sample , however , due to the average ( low ) redshift of this sample as well as its nature ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : zhisto2 ] ) .",
    "the seds are dominated by the stellar light all the way to the irac3 band ( 5.8 ) and even though the presence of a torus is somewhat revealed from the lower s@xmath32/s@xmath33 colour ( with respect to objects without a torus component ) , a single data point at 8.0 ( irac4 ) is not enough to constrain the torus properties . for the record , 36 of the remaining objects ( those without a 24 detection )",

    "such cases indicate the possible existence of an additional sb component , which we did not use for these fits because of the lack of observed 70 and/or 160 data points , as discussed in detail in section [ sec : sedfit ] .",
    "similarly , for the lower right object in fig .",
    "[ fig : elaisfits ] ( elais_j003718 - 421924 ) , the fit fails to reproduce the 160 point , despite the simultaneous existence of a torus and a sb components .",
    "this case shows that either the sb templates used are not always adequate or , most probably , that we are lacking a diffuse component that would account for the cold dust in the host galaxy .",
    "the fitting results show a clear preference for models with dust density decreasing with the distance from the centre , with 95% of the objects finding a better fit with @xmath35 models ( 75% with @xmath36 ) .",
    "a further dependence of the dust spatial distribution on the altitude from the equator was found , with 87% of the objects having a best fit model with @xmath37 .",
    "the resulting tori sizes do not depend on the type of object ( agn or hybrid ) and the estimated average inner tori radii , @xmath38 , are of 0.85@xmath390.50 and 0.91@xmath390.58 pc , for agn and hybrids , respectively , and with about 60% of the objects better matching torus models with small sizes ( @xmath40=30 ) .",

    "from the 23 objects composing the mir selected type 2 elais agn sample , 21 were found to have a torus component , all of which with @xmath43 , @xmath44=6.0 and @xmath35 , among which 15 found a better fit with @xmath45 templates .",

    "we will now attempt to put all the results from the various agn samples together and construct a common description of their dust properties . to this end",
    ", we will first present a summary of the results of paper 1 , that will also be used in this combined study .",
    "the low-@xmath7 sample will be excluded from this analysis , because of the unconfirmed ( stellar vs. starburst ) nature of the objects .",
    "they will be taken into account , however , when discussing the star formation , as the results on this issue seem to be more robust , and only marginally affected by the presence of tori , as suggested from fig .",
    "[ fig : kauff_agnfrac ] .",
    "paper 1 focused on the study of 278 sdss / swire quasars and the properties of dust surrounding them . comparing the results between the `` restricted '' run , where only high @xmath47 models were allowed and the `` full '' run , where optical depths as low as 0.1 were allowed , the hypothesis of the existence of low optical depth tori could not be ruled out . in fact , the majority of objects found a better match of their seds with low @xmath47 models ( @xmath48 . the computed average inner radius was of @xmath122.6 pc with a tendency for higher @xmath40i ( = 100 ) for the full run ( 59% ) with respect to the restricted run ( 46% ) , as reported in paper 1 .",
    "the covering factor depended of course on the choice of the optical depth but had a relatively flat distribution in both cases , taking values from as low as @xmath49 to as high as 0.95 .",
    "as for the dust density , there was no clear preference between @xmath50 and @xmath51 models , in any of the runs , while @xmath52 models were always favoured .",
    "the accretion and ir luminosities were the two better constrained quantities and were almost independent on the choice of @xmath47 .",
    "the subsample of 70 objects with 70 detections enabled an estimation of the contribution of a starburst to the total ir luminosity , indicating contributions of up to 80% .",
    "section [ sec : dataall ] described the observed properties of the combined agn sample . although the sample is not complete , the combined study of the various agn sub - samples composing it , will allow for comparative conclusions .",
    "[ fig : compare_props ] shows the distribution of the various parameters for the different samples . from top to bottom and left to right , and following the colour - coding introduced in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : colours ] we present : the accretion luminosity ; and the ir luminosity attributed to the torus component ( i.e. excluding the stellar emission coming either from the ssps and/or the sb components ) ; the covering factor ; the viewing angle ; the hydrogen column density along the line of site ; and the mass of dust confined inside the torus .",
    "the open histogram corresponds to the `` restricted '' run , where only high optical depth tori models ( @xmath3 ) were allowed ( paper 1 ) .",
    "the combined quasar and type 2 agn samples cover four orders of magnitude in @xmath53 , with the quasar @xmath53 distribution peaking at luminosities of about an order of magnitude brighter than the type 2s ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : compare_props ] - upper left ) .",
    "this observational bias affects , for example , the fraction of the ir luminosity attributed to the torus component ( fig .",
    "[ fig : compare_props ] - upper right ) .",
    "the viewing angle as derived from the fits , shown in the right column , second row , is consistent with the unified scheme postulating that the differences between type 1 and type 2 objects are a line - of - sight effect , with the type 2 objects seen through the obscuring material .",
    "almost all type 2 objects are seen in small viewing angles , i.e. close to the equator and through large amounts of dust , while type 1 objects are seen in large viewing angles especially when only tori with high optical depths are considered ( open green histogram ) .",
    "note that low optical depth tori would result in low obscuration type 2 agn when seen edge - on .",
    "4 in @xcite , e.g. , shows the emission of an agn through a @xmath54 torus for all lines of sights .",
    "while the object is clearly a type 1 when seen face - on , the uv - to - optical nuclear emission can be absorbed by several orders of magnitude when seen through the dust , depending on the wavelength and the line of sight .    the majority of type 2 objects are seen through high column densities ( @xmath55 ) , while the few quasars that are seen through the torus , are actually seen through low optical depth and lower than the type 2 column density gas ( fig .",
    "[ fig : compare_props ] , lower left panel ) .",
    "also consistent with the unified scheme is the distribution of the mass of dust ( right column , fourth row in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare_props ] ) .",
    "if the mass of dust can be considered a linear tracer of gas , this implies that the gas reservoirs in the vicinity of type 1 and type 2 objects are comparable .",
    "note that the properties of the radio and x - ray ( cosmos ) and mir - selected ( elais ) agn are remarkably similar with the only notable difference being the slightly higher ir luminosities of the torus components of the elais sample ( upper right plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare_props ] ) , simply reflecting the selection effects .",
    "the distribution of the values for the covering factor ( seen in the left column , second row in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare_props ] ) indicates that tori with both high and low covering factors are possible in both types of objects .",
    "the cosmos and elais samples show a stronger tendency for higher values .    the estimated type2:type1 ratios based on the cf distribution of the type2 objects is @xmath122 - 2.5:1 ;",
    "the same ratio is found when considering the restricted run of the quasar sample .",
    "the full type 1 run , however , suggests a ratio of 1:1 , with a mean value of the covering factor of @xmath120.47 , very close to the value of 0.4 computed by @xcite for the entire swire quasar population .",
    "this low value , seemingly in conflict with the unified scheme , actually reflects the difference in the accretion luminosity between the type 1 and type 2 samples ( fig .",
    "[ fig : compare_props ] ) , already discussed in section [ sec : compare ] .",
    "from the type 1 quasars with redshifts below @xmath56 we can measure the flux at 5100  , which we can then scale with the accretion luminosity , @xmath53 , as seen in the left panel of fig . [",
    "fig : fracobscagn ] . assuming this relation holds for all redshifts as well as for type 2 objects",
    ", we can translate @xmath53 to @xmath57 .",
    "we can then compute the fraction of obscured agn in bins of @xmath57 , shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fracobscagn ] .",
    "the black circles and open squares make use of the results of the full and restricted runs , respectively .",
    "the full and two dashed lines show the results and uncertainties ( due to bolometric corrections ) obtained by @xcite who conducted a study of 25 high luminosity high redshift ( @xmath58 ) quasars with irs spectroscopy . the observed trend , i.e. the decreasing average torus covering factor with increasing agn luminosity , is in support of the receding torus paradigm , suggested by @xcite .    despite the crude conversion of @xmath53 to @xmath57 our results making use of the full run are in very good agreement ( i.e. within the uncertainties ) with those derived by @xcite based on totally independent method and sample , while the results based on the restricted run , even though still consistent ( excluding the brightest two bins ) show a quite different trend .",
    "we can therefore still not conclude on the relative occurence of low @xmath47 tori with respect to high @xmath47 tori but , based on the above , we can still provide some evidence for their existence .",
    "previous studies ( e.g. @xcite ) assume that the ratio between the primary agn radiation ( here measured by @xmath53 ) and the thermal infrared emission attributed to the agn is a direct indicator of the torus covering factor .",

    "[ fig : lacclircf ] where the accretion - to - ir agn luminosity of each individual object of each sample is plotted against the computed covering factor .",
    "the slope of the correlation is very similar for type 1 and type 2 samples .",
    "type 2 objects , however , have considerably larger @xmath59 ratios than the quasars .",
    "this `` jump '' in the values is due to the different viewing angles and occurs right when the line of sight intercepts the obscuring torus . in order to illustrate this effect",

    "furthermore , in all those cases the contribution of the agn emission in the infrared is typically smaller than 50% , as seen in figs .",

    "these values are well in agreement with the findings of @xcite , a study based on stacking analysis of a variety of quasar samples .",
    "these values do not necessarily imply that star formation activity is stronger in type 1 quasars _ in general_. more likely , it reflects the observational biases of the samples , both in terms of average redshifts and luminosities ( figs .",
    "[ fig : zhisto2 ] and [ fig : compare_props ] ) .",
    "the starburst - to - agn luminosity ratio for the combined sample shows a slight tendency to decrease with increasing accretion luminosity , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : lsblagnlaccz ] .",
    "this is in apparent agreement with previous works on type 1 quasars alone ( again by @xcite ) , and if confirmed for the entire sample , would imply that type 1 and type 2 objects behave in the same way in this respect . on the other hand , we can not assert beyond doubt that there there is no implicit dependency on the redshift .",
    "in fact , examining the quasar sample alone ( open symbols ) we would be tempted to claim an _ increase _ with @xmath53 , but which is likely attributed to the @xmath61 - @xmath7 degeneracy .",
    "this work focuses on the ir properties type-2 agn , the type 1 issues having already been discussed in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "the collection of data used for this paper comes from : 1 ) a low - redshift ( @xmath62 ) agn sample , selected via standard emission - lines ratios criteria ; 2 ) a higher redshift ( @xmath63 ) sample from the cosmos and elais fields , selected with x - ray and mid - infrared criteria .",
    "the observed seds were reproduced by means of a three component model , including emission from stars , hot dust from agn and warm dust from starburst activity , and acceptable fits were obtained for the majority of the objects .    despite the fact that the samples we analyzed were not chosen homogeneously , a comparison of the behaviour between the physical properties of the type 1 and type 2 agn , shows an overall agreement .",
    "in paper i we found the covering factor to have a broad trend towards lower values as the accretion luminosity , i.e. the power of the central engine , increased with small , on - average , covering factors . applying",
    "the @xmath53 versus @xmath57 correlation derived for quasars in paper i , we derived the flux at 5100   for the type 2 samples and checked the correlation between the optical luminosity and the covering factor , which in turn , can be converted into a type1-to - type2 fraction .",
    "the results provided by the sed fitting analysis , show a very good agreement with the relation presented in maiolino et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , who find a correlation between the fraction of obscured agn as a function of the optical luminosity ( i.e. at 5100  ) .",
    "another indication of the dusty torus was thought to be ratio between the accretion luminosity and the torus infrared luminosity .",
    "in fact , the latter is just reprocessed radiation which scales linearly with the primary source : what makes the difference is the fraction of `` heating radiation '' which is intercepted by the dust , which again depends on the covering factor .",
    "we find a very similar trend for these quantities , in both type 1 and type 2 objects , also showing how differences in the amount of obscuration are very well explained by _",
    "dust self - absorption _ ,",
    "i.e. thermal dust emission absorbed by dust iteself .    for the low-@xmath7 sample , we found no evidence of emission from an agn component for @xmath64% of the objects .",
    "although we can not rule out the absence of an agn from these sources , we can set an upper limit to its luminosity since it is not observed at mid - infrared wavelengths where its emission is the strongest as compared to both that of the stellar and of the starburst - heated dust .",
    "this sample suffers from high contamination from the stellar emission component , even at mid - infrared wavelengths where ( on the contrary ) it s the agn component that usually dominates when present .",
    "the question to ask , therefore , is what can be really constrained with three or four data points .",
    "one of the most reliable quantities should be the optical depth , since low values would make the torus emission stand over the stellar ( sb or stars ) in the mir . in this respect",
    ", the low-@xmath7 sample may be too generous in selecting really active agn .",
    "there is , sometimes , no evidence for a mir excess at all with respect , for example , not only to a `` normal '' starburst emission , but also to a passively evolving galaxy . the absence of any evidence for",
    "a hot dust emission in the mir , which is the place where the stellar component is less important and the agn contribution is increasingly brighter , will remove the agn component from the fits even though this could also be turned into an upper limit . in the cases where there is a mir excess with respect to a pure stellar emission , we explore two possibilities : torus and pah emission . in some cases",
    "a better fit was obtained adding pah -i.e .",
    "starburst component alone- to the model instead of agn which should instead dilute the pah emission @xcite .",
    "comparison between clumpy and smooth tori models ( e.g. @xcite ) indicate that globally the seds produced by the two models are quite similar , but with some details characteristic for one or the other model : the silicate feature observed in absorption in objects seen edge - on is shallower for clumpy models , the average near - ir flux is weaker in smooth models and the clumpy models tend to produce slightly wider seds at certain inclinations .",
    "furthermore , clumpy models can produce very small tori sizes with @xmath65 @xcite , while still producing a broad mir emission .",
    "subsequently , the selection of a smooth torus for the present study might have resulted in overestimated tori sizes without , however , jeopardising the estimates on the properties related to the ir emission or our conclusions on the unification scheme .",
    "sed fitting may not be a sensitive enough method to distinguish between the differences introduced by the two approaches , because of the width of the filters and the scarce sampling of the observed seds , but also because the various characteristics of the torus component can be altered or diluted by , for example , the presence of a starburst component .",
    "notwithstanding these limitations , sed fitting is still the best tool available for extracting the maximum information from large photometric agn samples and is now proving to be a powerful technique in relating the dust properties to the accretion properties as well as the properties of the larger host galaxy .    because agn are of order hundred times less numerous than galaxies and also prone to selection biases , such agn studies are only possible with the advent of multi - wavelength surveys that probe large volumes and allow the construction of well - samples seds .",
    "even though we can not address all issues related to dusty tori , our understanding of their properties has been greatly improved over the last decade thanks to the spitzer observatory .",
    "this space infrared telescope allowed , among other things , the construction of seds of hundreds of agn of all types thanks to the irac and mips photometry ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "spitzer also opened the doors to detailed and coherent studies of the interplay between agn and starburst activity ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , paving the way for herschel .",
    "in fact , herschel with its two cameras / medium resolution spectrographs ( pacs ; @xcite and spire ; @xcite ) and a very high resolution heterodyne spectrometer ( hifi ; @xcite ) will be the first space facility to completely cover the range between 60 and 670 , where the the bulk of energy is emitted in the universe , allowing for a more detailed sampling of the observed fir seds and the cold dust emission .",
    "large parts of the herschel key science will focus on the formation and evolution of galaxies and the studies of star formation .",
    "hermes , the herschel multi - tiered extragalactic survey , is the largest project that will be conducted by herschel , with dedicated @xmath12900 hours that will map over 70 square degrees including most of the swire fields ( where most of the ir photometry of all the objects in this study comes from ) as well as other extragalactic survey fields covered by several missions in all wavelengths ( e.g. cosmos or the groth strip ) , and will address among others the issue of agn and starburst connection ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . additionally with herschel , the astrophysical terahertz large area survey ( atlas ) will cover about 500 square degrees and will observe all sdss quasars with redshift @xmath66 as well as _ all _ the brightest fir sdss quasars ( with luminosities 10 times larger than the mean ) , amounting to @xmath12330 individual detections of quasars in the area covered @xcite ( a factor of @xmath125 more than all the sdss quasars with 70 detections ) .",
    "these studies will allow us to significantly improve our understanding of the agn phenomenon , disentangle the contribution of cold and hot dust emission in their seds and study the concomitant occurence of nuclear activity and star formation .",

    "<S> this paper is the second part of a work investigating the properties of dusty tori in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) by means of multi - component spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting . </S>",
    "<S> it focuses on low luminosity , low redshift ( @xmath0 ) agn selected among emission line galaxies in the overlapping regions between swire and sdss data release 4 as well as x - ray , radio and mid - infrared selected type 2 agn samples from the literature . </S>",
    "<S> the available multi - band photometry covers the spectral range from the @xmath1-band up to 160 . </S>",
    "<S> using a standard @xmath2 minimisation , the observed sed of each object is fit to a set of multi - component models comprising a stellar component , a high optical depth ( @xmath3 ) torus and cold emission from a starburst ( sb ) . </S>",
    "<S> the torus components assigned to the majority of the objects were those of the highest optical depth of our grid of models ( @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the various components ( stars , torus , sb ) is reflected in the position of the objects on the irac colour diagram , with star- , torus- and starburst - dominated objects occupying specific areas of the diagrams and composite objects lying in between . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of type 1 ( as derived from paper 1 , @xcite ) and type 2 agn properties is broadly consistent with the unified scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated ratio between type 2 and type 1 objects is about 2 - 2.5:1 . </S>",
    "<S> the agn accretion - to - infrared luminosity ratio is an indicator of the obscuration of the agn since it scales down with the covering factor . </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence supporting the receding torus paradigm , with the estimated fraction of obscured agn , derived from the distribution of the covering factor , decreasing with increasing optical luminosity ( @xmath5 ) over four orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> the average star formation rates are of @xmath6 for the low-@xmath7 sample , @xmath8 for the other type 2 agn and @xmath9 for the quasars ; this result however , might simply reflect observational biases , as the quasars under study were one to two orders of magnitude more luminous than the various type 2 agn . </S>",
    "<S> for the large majority of objects with 70 and/or 160 detections an sb component was needed in order to reproduce the data points , implying that the far - infrared emission in agn arises mostly from star formation ; moreover , the starburst - to - agn luminosity ratio shows a slight trend with increasing luminosity .    </S>",
