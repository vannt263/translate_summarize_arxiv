    "every time we use the internet ( particularly social media platforms , search engines , email servers ) we leave our traces behind which generates a huge volume of data ( hommes 2002 ) , ( bouchaud , matacz , and potters 2001 ) , ( haldane and may 2011 ) .",
    "this huge data carrying a lot of opportunity for understanding the individual as well as collective behaviours .",
    "collective behaviours are more important in many domain such as finance , viral marketing , epidemic disease prevention and so on , by targeting or controlling individuals or communities when predicting their behaviour and / or events and trends in societies .",
    "for example from google trend some researchers infer the real world phenomena such as geographical location of disease spread ( ginsberg et al .",
    "2008 ) , stock market prediction ( preis , moat , and stanley 2013 ) , which product will be in demand or who is going to win this election.likewise , social media platforms such as twitter has been used to track human mobility , improve the response to disasters , etc .",
    "therefore we can say this big data is carrying ample amount of opportunities for scientists and researchers from all disciplines to solve this complex world problem ( axtell 2001 ) , ( king 2011 ) , ( vespignani 2009 ) , ( perc 2012 ) .",
    "most of the big data of the interactions of people in the internet can be modeled the following two main different types of networks can be shaped from such data : a ) monopartite , in which the nodes have similar types ( i.e. , only people or items ) and links reflect a relationship among them ; and b ) bipartite , in which the nodes can be from different types ( i.e. , people and items ) and links show a relationship between different types of nodes . by",
    "generally simply the latter type can be transformed to two different monopartite networks .",
    "nevertheless , one of the main attributes in such network is the link formation among the nodes over time which can help to manage the dynamics of the network and make appropriate decision ( abbasi 2016 ) .",
    "although the quality item or fit node always show some common characteristics i.e they compete to get attention",
    ". it may be possible in presence of popular nodes its strength forgotten .",
    "researchers have also found that in network such as paper citation it may not get attention for long time ( ke et al .",
    "2015 ) , some gain popularity many times ( cheng et al . 2016 ) . in all the cases we think as also been proven that recent activity of the node is one of the important feature of node for future activity ( gleeson et al .",
    "2014 ) , ( zeng et al .",
    "popularity or future link gain prediction is a complex task depending on different factors like quality or nodes fitness and so on .",
    "content popularity may fluctuate with time ( eisler , bartos , and kertesz 2008 ) , increase over time or be limited within communities .",
    "most recently researchers have found that the popularity of online contents like news , blog posts , videos , mobile app download ( gleeson et al . 2014 ) in online discussion forums and product reviews exhibits temporal dynamics .",
    "emergence or first time occurence is novelty for those who did nt face it before , which can be innovation also .",
    "innovation is special case of novelty in a sense it is entertained by collective attention , while novelty may not .",
    "the emergence , novelty , trend or future occurrence prediction models can be found since quite long time ago such as ( zanette and montemurro 2005 ) , ( hoppe 1984 ) , ( simon 1955 ) , ( tria et al .",
    "emergence prediction theory applies in many areas of life such as economics ( simon 1955 ) , biology ( e. and yule 1925 ) , physics ( redner 1998 ) etc .",
    "( simon 1955 ) has given stochastic model which fits to skewed or power law distribution or fit to rich - gets - richer phenomenon .",
    "it is obvious that popularity of any item on social media does nt last forever .",
    "in addition decay rate may vary from item to item .",
    "every type of node have its own decay rate like ( parolo et al .",
    "2015 ) have found research article citation rate decays after some time .",
    "cumulative advantage is a well known phenomenon seen almost in every evolving networks , which states that popularity increases cumulatively ; the rate of new link ( either item receives rating in case of movielens , or a friend like or comments in case of facebook wall post activity ) formation for any node is proportional to the observed number of links which node has received in past .",
    "authors in ( d. wang , song , and barabasi 2013 ) for quantifying long term prediction considered fitness of paper for future citation gain of the paper . the nature of paper citation distribution is also found fat tailed or skewed which tells only few papers carrying most of the citation while most of the papers no citation or very very low ( redner 1998 ) .",
    "we have solved the novelty problem using networks because of its wide application ( garlaschelli , caldarelli , and pietronero 2003 ) , ( buldyrev et al .",
    "almost everything shows aging effect , from biological organism to inanimate twitter `` meme '' .",
    "trend is side effect of aging ; some perform better and loose influence within few hours and some perform for years .",
    "therefore aging is one of the important factor that we should taken into consideration while solving emergence phenomena .",
    "novelty is in one sense unexpected event or occurrence in future temporal domain , therefore recent behavior is an important feature for predicting rising novelties on evolving networks .",
    "emergence can also be considered as after product of competition and aging .",
    "ranking index on the basis of action of interest is one of the best way to understand emergence and competition such as in our case action of interest is in link formation of the node . therefore considering all above facts",
    "we have solved the problem of emergence or rising novelty considering ; aging and recent behavior ( recent link gain ) as well as total behavior ( total link gain ) , and tested performance of our model on ranking index based metrics .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we have introduced the benchmark models and also proposed our model . in section 3",
    "we have given details about data sets and indexes that we have used for testing our model . in section 4",
    "we have given the results . in section 5",
    "we have concluded the paper .",
    "before introducing our two proposed models for link prediction .",
    "first we briefly describe four existing prediction models ( i.e. , node in - degree ; pagerank(pr ) ; popularity based predictor(pbp ) ; and temporal based predictor(tbp ) ) which will be used to benchmark the models and compare their performance using the evaluation metrics which will be discussed in the last part of this section .",
    "pagerank given by ( brin and page 1998 ) was developed to rank webpages on internet for google search engine optimization purpose . it can be applied in other networked architecture also where structural property of the node plays an important role such as information diffusion , scientific paper / author ranking etc .",
    "pagerank algorithm can be given as follows:- if node @xmath0 have link to node @xmath1 there will be a directed link between them ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "if node ( i.e webpage ) @xmath1 has @xmath3 set of link to other nodes then page will distribute its importance in @xmath4(the number of nodes in set @xmath5 ) .",
    "generally , the transition matrix of the network or graph @xmath6 can be given as follows-    @xmath7    since there can be nodes that do not have link to other nodes although they are being pointed by other nodes , also known as _ dangling nodes _ , so new transformed matrix ( s ) can be given as-    @xmath8    where @xmath9 matrix have all the elements zero except for * dangling nodes * column which are @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of rows or nodes in the matrix . easy to find that those columns are normalized that sums to one for making column stochastic matrix",
    ". now the pagerank of _ dangling nodes _ will not be zero .",
    "since random surfer will follow the link from one page to another , suppose that random surfer follows the pagerank ( follows s ) with probability @xmath12 then there is ( @xmath13 ) probability that he will choose a random page .",
    "so now pagerank matrix also known as google matrix @xmath14 can be given as-    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is matrix of size @xmath17 , it s every element as one .",
    "pagerank vector @xmath18 can be calculated using power method as @xmath19 it will definitely converge to a static vector which is pagerank .",
    "( zeng et al . 2013 ) came up with popularity based predictor(pbp ) .",
    "it exploits the _",
    "preferential attachment _ phenomenon , which states that popularity increases cumulatively ; the rate of new link ( either item receives rating in case of movielens , or a friend like or comments in case of facebook wall post activity ) formation for any node is proportional to the observed number of links which node has received in past . if an item is popular at time @xmath20 , then it will probably be popular due to the condition that current degree of an item @xmath21 is a good predictor of its future popularity .",
    "( zeng et al . 2013 ) proposes to calculate the prediction score of an item at time @xmath22 can be given as follows-    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the rating / links received up to time @xmath22 . @xmath25 } $ ] , note that @xmath26 gives the total popularity and for @xmath27 it gives recent popularity . through out the manuscript by popularity we mean number of ratings or links received by item or node",
    "this model ( zhou , zeng , and wang 2015 ) considers decay effect only while collecting score of node for future probability of getting links .",
    "@xmath28    where @xmath29 is prediction score for node @xmath30 at time @xmath22 , @xmath31 is the user object adjacency matrix , and @xmath32 is the time when object or node received link and @xmath33 is the decay rate .      in many systems such as human , herding or recent behavior followers",
    "are very common . although it is well known that people go for popular items or follow rich - gets - richer behavior , but to understand emergence , recent behavior is one of the important factor .",
    "people follow the strength of the node also , with recent behaviours .",
    "we also know `` congestion feeds itself '' phenomena , meaning having more recent attractions(e.g recent new links ) may lead to gaining more recent attractions . to quantify all these phenomena we came up with a model that gives weight to recency of link formation",
    ". if there are few attentions to node ( e.g links ) then will give weight to total popularity gain . since we are modeling a system in which humans are core of its action for making link either user item bipartite network , facebook friend ship network or paper citation network .",
    "and if people follow recent behavior in making links then recent degree gain must be a good predictor for future degree gain . in the same way",
    "if they follow total degree or popularity of the node then total degree would be a good predictor .",
    "but in reality people follow both therefore , we supppose people follow recent behavior with probability @xmath34 , and with @xmath13 they follow total degree or popularity of the items .",
    "@xmath35    where @xmath36,@xmath24 reflect the link gain upto time @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath37 is dominance factor .",
    "it depends on system to system ho much recent behavior dominated system is , weak or strong . such as for `` bursty '' behavior strong dominance should work . in our case @xmath37 is from cumulative distribution of @xmath38 .",
    "it means @xmath37 is biased towards recent behaviours , the more recent behaviour , the higher @xmath37 will be .",
    "if the recent behaviour probability ( @xmath38 ) , is low then the model score will depends on total link gain .",
    "which is why we call this model `` recent behavior dominant model(rbdm ) '' .      in this model",
    "we think recent behavior is effect of long term past behavior .",
    "if a node is getting more link recently it is because it has already gained link in past . in other words",
    "people follow recent behaviours but also at the same time they concern about past links . in that system",
    "we need to give weightage to both behaviours .",
    "so to model this we think if a node is active in recent time and also it was popular then its probability of gaining link in future is high .",
    "@xmath39    since we are considering evolving systems , we should consider the time as an important factor .",
    "therefore to calculate total score of node , i.e @xmath24 , we used aging effect similar to tbp model described above .",
    "@xmath37 is from cumulative distribution of @xmath38 .",
    "to test the performance and robustness of our model we have considered different data sets and evaluation metrics .",
    "four evaluation metrics are adopted to measure the accuracy of the proposed model including _ _",
    "precision__@xmath40,__novelty__@xmath41 and _ area under recieving operating characteristic_(@xmath42 ) and rank correlation kendall s tau(@xmath43 ) .    * _ precision _ is defined as the fraction of objects that are predicted also lie in the top @xmath11 object of true ranking ( herlocker et al .",
    "@xmath44 where @xmath45 is the number of common objects between predicted and real ranking .",
    "@xmath46 is the size of list to be ranked .",
    "its value ranges in [ 0,1 ] , higher value of @xmath40 is better . * _ novelty(@xmath47 ) _ is a metric to measure the ability of a predictor to rank the items in top @xmath46 position that was not in top @xmath46 position in past ( zeng et al .",
    ". these are the rising novelties in the system .",
    "if we denote the predicted object as ( @xmath48 ) and potential true object as @xmath49 , then the novelty is given by- @xmath50 * _ auc _ measures the relative position of the predicted item and true ranked items .",
    "suppose predicted item list is ( @xmath51 ) and real item list is ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "if @xmath53 and @xmath54 is score of object in predicted then _ auc _ is given by-    @xmath55    where , @xmath56    * _ kendal s tau(@xmath43 ) _ measures the correlation between predicted and actual ratings .",

    "it can be given as-    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the number of concordant pairs and @xmath64 is the number of discordant pairs .      to test the predictors accuracy we have used different data sets including movielens , netflix , facebook wall post and arxiv paper citation . movielens and netflix data sets contains movie ratings , facebook data set contains users wall post relationships and arxiv citation data set contains paper citation information from arxiv database of high energy physics http://snap.stanford.edu/data/cit-hepph.html[field ] ( gehrke , ginsparg , and kleinberg 2003 ) .",

    "the merits of our model is it helps identifying novel entries without any significant cost of predicting already popular items . in this paper",

    "<S> novelty attracts attention like popularity . hence predicting novelty is as important as popularity . </S>",
    "<S> novelty is the side effect of competition and aging in evolving systems . </S>",
    "<S> recent behavior or recent link gain in networks plays an important role in emergence or trend . </S>",
    "<S> we exploited this wisdom and came up with two models considering different scenarios and systems . </S>",
    "<S> where recent behavior dominates over total behavior ( total link gain ) in the first one , and recent behavior is as important as total behavior for future link gain in second one . </S>",
    "<S> it suppose that random walker walks on a network and can jump to any node , the probablity of jumping or making connection to other node is based on which node is recently more active or receiving more links . in our assumption random walker </S>",
    "<S> can also jump to node which is already popular but recently not popular . </S>",
    "<S> we are able to predict rising novelties or popular nodes which is generally suppressed under preferential attachment effect . to show performance of our model we have conducted experiments on four real data sets namely , movielens , netflix , facebook and arxiv high energy physics paper citation . for testing our model we used four information retrieval indices namely precision , novelty , area under receiving operating characteristic(auc ) and kendal s rank correlation coefficient </S>",
    "<S> we have used four benchmark models for validating our proposed models . although our model does nt perform better in all the cases but </S>",
    "<S> , it has theoretical significance in working better for recent behavior dominant systems . </S>"
