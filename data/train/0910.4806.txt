    "they are extensively used to determine distances to old and sufficiently metal - poor systems , where they are commonly found in large numbers . in particular , rrl stars are present in globular clusters ( gcs ) and the dwarf galaxies in the neighborhood of the milky way ( greco et al .",

    "the road map of the present investigation is to perform a fourier analysis of the rrl stars in order to estimate their physical parameters and hence the smc distance scale .",

    "all the selected targets have evenly covered i band light curves with about 100 - 400 data points in i band with an internal accuracy of 0.03 - 0.13 mag in i band .",
