    "strange quark matter ( sqm ) has been one of the hot topics in nuclear physics since witten s conjecture @xcite that sqm might be the true ground state of strong interactions .",
    "lumps of sqm are customarily called strangelets @xcite , or for short , slets @xcite .",
    "there are basically two kinds of slets : one is the ordinary slets without pairing @xcite , the other is the color superconductivity slets @xcite . the possible terrestrial production of slets has been studied in high energy heavy ion experiments , e.g. , at the cern sps energies @xcite . for a review on recent experimental searches of quark - gluon plasma at brookhaven rhic ,",
    "see ref .  @xcite . at high densities , quark matter may be the most favorite phase , and could thus exist in the core of compact stars @xcite .",
    "strange star collisions could release slets as part of the energetic cosmic rays , and some of the cosmic ray slets might be on the way to our earth @xcite . the alpha magnetic spectrometer ( ams-02 ) @xcite , which is planned to operate on the international space station , may offer the opportunity to detect these slets @xcite .",
    "it is still an interesting open problem whether or not these cosmic ray slets incident on top of the earth s atmosphere can reach to the ground or sea level .",
    "in fact , several exotic cosmic ray events with anomalously low charge - to - mass ratio have been observed at rather low altitudes @xcite . in literature , one finds a number of possible scenarios of slet propagation which depends strongly on assumed size of slets .",
    "for example , the radius of slets used in @xcite is different from that in @xcite by nearly an order of magnitude . since the mean free path of a slet in the atmosphere is strongly dependent on its radius @xmath2 , as , for instance , in the simple law @xmath3 $ ] where @xmath4 mev is the nucleon mass , @xmath5 and @xmath6 fm are , respectively , the mean mass number and radius of the nucleus in the atmosphere , different radii led to significantly different conclusions .",
    "meanwhile , the charge property of slets is very important , as shown by madsen _",
    "et al . _ who found that the slets of low charge - to - mass ratio are favored in the ultra - high - energy cosmic rays @xcite , and the color flavor locked ( cfl ) slets have charge @xmath7 0.3@xmath8 where @xmath9 is the baryon number .",
    "et al . _ also demonstrated that the slets with large baryon number have positive charges @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "in addition to these positively charged slets , negative charges are also possible for both ordinary @xcite and cfl slets @xcite in beta equilibrium . at the same time",
    ", the strangeness fraction is also an important factor to determine the stable configuration of slets @xcite .",
    "recently , we suggested a new quark mass scaling @xcite based on the linear confinement , and the new model was applied to investigating the properties of slets in full beta equilibrium . in heavy ion collision experiments",
    ", however , the time scale is not enough for perfect beta equilibrium .",
    "moreover , the charge / strangeness composition , and especially the size of slets , are quite important and useful to analyse possibility of production and detection of slets @xcite . in this paper , therefore , we study the relevant properties of slets with the new quark mass scaling in @xcite , without imposing beta equilibrium , and with focus on the slet size . it is found that the mechanically stable radius of a slet with fixed baryon number and temperature is not a monotonic function of either charge @xmath0 or strangeness @xmath1 .",
    "the radius has a minimum in the @xmath11 plane .",
    "however , the radius minimum does not correspond to the minimum of free energy .",
    "we determine the composition of thermodynamically stable slets by minimizing the free energy . for a large baryon number @xmath9 , the corresponding slet radius is @xmath12a^{1/3}$ ] , where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the confinement parameter in the present model . if sqm is absolutely stable , the reduced stable radius is @xmath15 fm . in the conventional bag model ,",
    "slets always contain strange quarks . in the present model",
    ", we find that very small slets tend to contain anti - strangeness , and the ratio of charge to baryon number increases .",
