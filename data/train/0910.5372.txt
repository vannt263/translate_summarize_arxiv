    "luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) are arguably some of the brightest galaxies in our universe allowing us to study their evolution out to much higher redshifts than is possible with samples of more typical galaxies .",
    "lrgs are known to form a spectroscopically homogenous population that can be reliably identified photometrically by means of simple colour selections @xcite .",
    "the presence of a strong 4000 break in these galaxies also means that accurate photometric redshifts can be derived for large samples where spectroscopy is difficult to obtain @xcite .",
    "consequently , samples of luminous red galaxies have emerged as an important data set both for studies of cosmology @xcite and galaxy formation and evolution @xcite .",
    "the study of massive galaxies in our universe is particularly interesting since these galaxies present a long - standing problem for models of galaxy formation .",
    "while in the standard @xmath6cdm cosmology , massive galaxies are thought to be built up through successive mergers of smaller systems @xcite , many observations now suggest that these galaxies were already well assembled at high redshifts @xcite . at the same time ,",
    "star formation and merging activity has also been seen in such systems between @xmath7 and the present day @xcite and the studies of @xcite and @xcite have found evidence that the luminosity density of massive red galaxies has remained roughly constant since z@xmath81 implying a build up in the number density of these objects through mergers .",
    "most observational results now support downsizing in star formation - i.e most massive galaxies having lower specific star formation rates than their less massive counterparts - and many galaxy formation models are able to reproduce these observations e.g. by invoking quenching mechanisms such as agn feedback @xcite . however , the more recently observed trend of downsizing in the mass assembly @xcite presents more of a challenge for galaxy formation models which typically predict that the most massive galaxies were assembled later than their less massive counterparts .",
    "many of the contradictions in observational studies of massive galaxy formation arise principally for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the way in which early - type galaxies are selected in different surveys can be considerably different .",
    "morphological selection compared to colour selection of such objects will almost certainly result in different samples being chosen , particularly at high redshifts .",
    "the colour selection is also usually different for different samples of massive galaxies as we will point out later in this paper .",
    "secondly , many of the studies of massive galaxy formation mentioned so far are deep and narrow spectroscopic samples that will suffer from biases due to the effects of cosmic variance .",
    "in addition , one has to be careful in interpreting observational results as in current galaxy formation models , star formation and mass assembly in galaxies are not necessarily concomitant .",
    "so while the stars in early - type galaxies may have formed very early in the universe s history , they may have formed in relatively small units and only merged at lower redshifts to create the massive etgs we see today .",
    "studies of the evolution of luminous red galaxies such as those analysed in this paper have already supported the evidence that massive galaxies have been passively fading and show very little recent star formation @xcite . in this paper , we extend this work by also considering the mass assembly of these systems . the 2df and sdss lrg and qso ( 2slaq ) survey presents a comprehensive improvement in volume for massive galaxy samples .",
    "the survey covers an area of 186 deg@xmath9 and reaches out to a redshift of 0.8 making it a promising data set to study the evolution of massive red galaxies .",
    "furthermore , much of the 2slaq area is now covered by the ukidss large area survey ( las ) that provides complementary data in the near infra - red bands for the optically selected lrgs .",
    "the advantage of near infra - red data is that the mass - to - light ratios and k - corrections are largely insensitive to the galaxy or stellar type and therefore the total infra - red flux in for example the k - band provides a good estimate of the total stellar mass of the galaxies .",
    "this stellar mass estimate allows us to study not only the star formation history but also the mass assembly history of these systems .",
    "as is the case for optically selected spectroscopic samples of massive galaxies , the k - band selected surveys have so far been restricted to relatively small and deep patches of the sky @xcite . clearly",
    "a large spectroscopic survey of massive galaxies with optical and near infra - red photometry , will allow for better constraints on the evolution of these systems .    in this paper",
    ", we utilise a spectroscopic sample of colour - selected massive red galaxies from the 2slaq survey between redshifts 0.4 and 0.8 .",
    "optical photometry is obtained from the sloan digital sky survey supplemented with near infra - red data from the ukidss large area survey ( las ) .",
    "we consider the evolution of these galaxies in terms of their observed colours , luminosities and comoving number densities focussing particularly on the effects of colour selection on the inferred evolution .",
    "@xcite have presented a comprehensive analysis of the luminosity function of luminous red galaxies using data from both the sloan digital sky survey and the 2slaq survey .",
    "these authors use a subset of data from the 2slaq survey in the redshift range 0.5 to 0.6 and by comparing this galaxy population to a lower redshift population at @xmath10 from sdss , they are able to establish that the lrg lf does not evolve beyond that expected from a simple passive evolution model at these redshifts .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite have compared the low - redshift sdss lrg population to their own high - redshift sample at redshifts of @xmath11 and once again find little evidence for evolution beyond the passive fading of the stellar populations .",
    "we extend the work of these authors by considering now most of the galaxies available in the 2slaq data set .",
    "this enables the redshift range of 2slaq galaxies used to be broadened to @xmath12 .",
    "the 2slaq luminosity function is presented for 8625 lrgs as compared to the 1725 used by @xcite .",
    "these results are useful in filling the gap between redshift 0.4 and 0.5 and redshift 0.6 and 0.8 in the @xcite and @xcite data sets .",
    "the sample is split into four redshift bins and the evolution of the luminosity and colour of lrgs between these redshift bins is considered .",
    "in addition , we also consider the stellar mass function and its evolution with redshift .",
    "furthermore , we use various different stellar population synthesis models that are commonly used in the literature , to model the lrgs , including the new models of @xcite and quantify the sensitivity of the luminosity function estimate to changes in these models .",
    "the optical colours of lrgs have long been difficult to model using standard spectral evolution models @xcite and this problem has only recently been solved @xcite thereby allowing us to utilise the most accurate spectral evolution models of lrgs to date in order to infer their evolution .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in @xmath13 [",
    "sec : data ] we describe the spectroscopic 2slaq data set as well as sdss and ukidss photometry for these galaxies . @xmath13 [ sec : models ] describes the spectral evolution models used in this paper to model the lrgs .",
    "we consider the optical luminosity function of the 2slaq lrgs in @xmath13 [ sec : lf ] and its evolution with redshift as well as its sensitivity to cosmic variance , photometric errors and changes in the spectral evolution models . in @xmath13 [",
    "sec : number ] we present estimates for the lrg mass function in different redshift bins and analyse its sensitivity to the choice of spectral evolution model as well as the imf .",
    "finally , we discuss our results in @xmath13 [ sec : disc ] in terms of models of galaxy formation and evolution . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a cosmological model with @xmath14=0.3 , @xmath15=0.7 and @xmath16=0.7 .",
    "all magnitudes are in the ab system unless otherwise stated .",
    "our dataset is a spectroscopic sample of luminous red galaxies from the 2df and sdss lrg and qso ( 2slaq ) survey @xcite .",
    "this survey was conducted on the 2-degree field ( 2df ) spectrograph on the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope .",
    "the survey recorded spectra for @xmath810000 lrgs with a median redshift of 0.55 and @xmath810000 faint @xmath17 qsos selected from sdss imaging data .",
    "the survey covers an area of 186 deg@xmath9 and extends to a redshift of @xmath18 for the lrgs . in this section",
    ", we provide a description of the 2slaq data as well as optical and near infra - red photometry for these galaxies obtained using the sdss and ukidss las @xcite respectively .    in the 2slaq survey",
    ", the following colour and magnitude cuts have been applied using sdss dr4 photometry in order to isolate the main lrg population to target with spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "@xmath19    @xmath20    @xmath21    where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the dereddened sdss model magnitudes , @xmath25 is the i - band devaucouleurs magnitude and @xmath26 is the extinction in the i - band .",
    "the devaucouleurs magnitudes are obtained by fitting a pure devaucouleurs profile to the 2d galaxy images .",
    "the definitions of both these types of magnitudes as well as other sdss parameters can be found at ` http://www.sdss.org/dr4/algorithms/photometry.html ` as well as @xcite .",
    "these cuts are for the primary sample defined as sample 8 in @xcite which has the highest completeness and this is the sample that we use throughout this paper .",
    "m stars are expected to make up @xmath85% of the sample but can be excluded by their low redshifts . in addition , as will be discussed later in the paper , photometric errors could scatter objects both in and out of the sample across the colour selection boundaries and lead to some contamination .",
    "@xcite have conducted a detailed study of the star formation histories of this 2slaq lrg sample and find that 80% of the objects , which represents the vast majority , are passive in nature as would be expected from early type systems .",
    "the rest are mainly emission line galaxies .",
    "note also that the colour cuts applied in order to isolate lrgs are usually different for different surveys .",
    "for example the colour cuts used to isolate lrgs in the sdss lrg sample @xcite results in a distribution that is redder than that of the 2slaq galaxies . if these different lrg samples are to be compared therefore , further cuts must be applied to them to ensure a consistent colour selection as in @xcite .    in the case of the 2slaq lrgs ,",
    "the effect of the @xmath27 cut is to select early - type galaxies at increasingly high redshifts whereas the @xmath28 cut eliminates late - type galaxies from the sample .",
    "most of the sample has redshifts of @xmath29 with @xmath85% contamination from m - type stars @xcite . in order to capture the main redshift distribution of this primary sample , only galaxies with @xmath30",
    "are used in this work .",
    "note , however that most of the galaxies lie above a redshift of 0.45 and our conclusions remain unchanged if we choose the lower redshift limit of our sample to be 0.45 instead .",
    "furthermore , we have also selected only galaxies with a redshift quality flag of greater than 2 .",
    "this results in a sample of 8625 lrgs and the redshift completeness for this sample is 76.1% ( david wake : private communication ) .",
    "all lrgs in our sample have secure spectroscopic redshifts .             in figure",
    "[ fig : colourz ] , we plot the lrgs in the observed ( g - r ) versus ( r - i ) plane in redshift bins of width 0.1 .",
    "isolating bright galaxies only with @xmath31 and plotting them in the same colour - colour plane shows clearly how the red sequence is truncated in the lowest redshift bin due to the redshift dependant colour selection .",
    "the effect of this truncation on the luminosity function estimate will be described in more detail in @xmath13 [ sec : lf ] .    in order to obtain accurate stellar masses for the lrgs ,",
    "the 2slaq data is matched to near infra - red data from the ukidss large area survey ( las ) dr5 which has a depth of @xmath32=18.4 .",
    "the galaxies are matched to within 1.1 arcsecs in position using the wfcam science archive and only galaxies with detections in the k - band are selected .",
    "out of our total sample of 8625 2slaq lrgs , we have k - band data for 6476 of them which represents @xmath875% of the sample .",
    "the ukidss k - band magnitudes are in the vega system and have been corrected to the ab system using the corrections of @xcite .",
    "@xcite have conducted a detailed analysis of the effect of photometric errors on the 2slaq lrg sample .",
    "these photometric errors could induce a systematic bias in the sample by scattering galaxies both in and out of the sample across the colour selection boundaries . for @xmath33 , the effect of the photometric errors",
    "is relatively insignificant and the colour - magnitude distributions of lrgs selected using single - epoch photometry and those selected using multi - epoch photometry are almost identical @xcite .",
    "fainter than this however , the photometric errors may present a significant systematic bias to the inferred colour and luminosity evolution of lrgs in this survey .",
    "note that the magnitude errors inferred using the single - epoch data are found to be systematically underestimated .",
    "the effect of these photometric errors on the luminosity function estimate is considered in @xmath13 [ sec : err ] .",
    "it turns out that different estimators of the luminosity function have different sensitivity to the photometric errors and this point is addressed in more detail in appendix a.",
    "in order to calculate the rest - frame properties of lrgs and infer their evolution , the observed properties need to be transformed into the rest - frame by means of a k - correction .",
    "in addition , one can also correct for any evolutionary changes expected in the galaxy spectra by means of an e - correction .",
    "motivated by the work of @xcite , we start by using a pegase @xcite template to model the spectral evolution of the lrgs . in this template ,",
    "the stars are formed in a single burst 11gyr ago ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "we assume a @xcite imf , solar metallicity and no galactic winds or substellar objects .",
    "however , it has been noted by several authors that stellar population synthesis models such as pegase and those of @xcite fail to reproduce the observed colours of lrgs @xcite .",
    "improvements to these models have subsequently been made that involve changes to the input stellar libraries as well as including an additional metal - poor sub component to the stellar population in order to create a composite model @xcite .",
    "such models predict significantly bluer ( g - r ) colours compared to simple stellar population models and are better able to reproduce the observed broadband colours of individual lrgs . for this reason , a maraston model of age 12gyr corresponding to a galaxy mass of 10@xmath35 m@xmath4",
    "is also considered in this work .    finally , we consider the models of charlot & bruzual 2007 @xcite - cb07 hereafter - with a range of different metallicities and star formation histories in order to quantify the systematics associated to the different prescriptions , isochrones and stellar libraries of the population synthesis models .",
    "all the cb07 templates assume a formation redshift of z@xmath36 and a @xcite imf .",
    "k and k+e corrections in the r - band derived from each of these models , are illustrated in figure [ fig : kcorr ] .",
    "in addition , k - corrections are also derived from stacked lrg spectra from the sdss lrg survey @xcite at redshifts 0.2 and 0.5 .",
    "these are very similar to each other suggesting that there is little or no colour evolution in the sdss lrgs between redshifts of 0.2 and 0.5 . as the 2slaq lrg spectra",
    "are not flux calibrated , a similar derivation of the k - corrections using these was not possible .",
    "although the sdss lrgs are selected using different colour cuts , it is still interesting to compare their k - corrections to the ones derived using the various spectral evolution models and it can be seen that the empirical k - corrections best match those derived from a maraston model . for this reason , the composite 12gyr model from @xcite has been used throughout this paper unless otherwise stated .",
    "we can also see from the right - hand panel of figure [ fig : kcorr ] that the e - correction is very sensitive both to the star - formation history of the galaxy as well as the metallicity as galaxies with some residual star formation as well as those at high metallicity have more negative e - corrections .         in figure",
    "[ fig : colours ] we also plot the rest - frame ( g - r ) and ( r - i ) colours of lrgs derived using the different spectral evolution models as a function of redshift .",
    "once again it is seen that the maraston model is able to reproduce the colours derived from sdss composite spectra almost exactly unlike the pegase model",
    ". however , we note that unlike in @xcite , we find that including the evolutionary correction to the maraston models , creates a mismatch in the colours of the model and the sdss composite spectra .",
    "the sdss observed colours are found to be redder than the evolving maraston model .",
    "we have already noted that the sdss lrg colour distribution is redder than that of the 2slaq galaxies used in @xcite for comparison to their models so this difference is perhaps to be expected .",
    "it should also be noted that the observed colours derived from the spectra are derived from the fiber magnitudes of the galaxies .",
    "as the fibers only enclose light within a 3  aperture and it is well known that early type galaxies have colour gradients @xcite , this could be why the colours appear redder but it is unlikely that this effect would be significant especially at redshifts of 0.5 .",
    "finally , the redshift 0.5 lrgs in the sdss survey are the brightest and therefore expected to be the reddest galaxies in this survey @xcite .",
    "all these factors may help explain the discrepancy in the observed and model colours derived using the evolving maraston model .",
    "figure [ fig : gri ] shows the 2slaq lrgs in the observed ( g - r ) versus ( r - i ) colour - colour plane along with the main colour selection boundaries as well as the tracks produced in this plane by different stellar population synthesis models as well as sdss composite spectra .",
    "it can be seen that both the maraston as well as pegase burst models only enter the @xmath37 selection at redshifts of @xmath80.45 .",
    "star forming galaxies with @xmath38gyr are clearly excluded at all redshifts by the @xmath28 selection .",
    "the luminosity function for 2slaq lrgs is calculated in this section in order to infer any evolution in the observed number density of these objects .",
    "the non - parametric @xmath39 estimator is used to calculate luminosity functions and a gaussian parametric form is fit by means of a @xmath40 minimisation where appropriate .",
    "the gaussian parametric form provides a better fit to the luminosity function of early - type galaxies compared to the more commonly used schechter function and has three free parameters , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the parametric form is given by :    @xmath44    the commonly used parametric estimator of @xcite ( sty hereafter ) is prone to biases for this data set and therefore has not been presented in the main body of the paper .",
    "details of the sty estimator and the biases induced on it are given in appendix a.    the v@xmath45 estimator relies on measuring the maximum volume occupied by a galaxy given the survey selection criteria . by scaling the observed number density by this accessible volume",
    ", we account for the fact that only the brightest galaxies are observed at high redshifts in a flux - limited sample . for the 2slaq survey ,",
    "this maximum volume depends not only on the maximum redshift out to which the galaxy could be observed given the flux limit of @xmath46 but also the minimum redshift at which the galaxy would be included in the survey given the @xmath37 and @xmath28 colour selection criteria .",
    "the maximum volume for each galaxy is then given by :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the selection functions for each galaxy due to the two primary colour cuts ( eq [ eq : cut3 ] and [ eq : cut4 ] ) and the flux limit ( eq [ eq : cut5 ] ) . once this maximum volume has been derived for every galaxy in the sample , the luminosity function which is simply the number density of galaxies per unit brightness , is given by :    @xmath51    where c is the redshift completeness of the sample assumed to be 76.1% and the index , @xmath24 runs over all galaxies in the absolute magnitude bin @xmath52 .",
    "the errors on the luminosity function are assumed to be poissonian and are given by :    @xmath53    the best - fit parametric form is derived using a @xmath40 fit to the @xmath39 data points .",
    "we marginalise over the normalisation , @xmath41 which is determined independantly from the observed number density of galaxies .",
    "the marginalised @xmath40 to be minimised is :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 refers to the parametric luminosity function which is assumed to be a gaussian function and @xmath56 represents the @xmath39 data points with errors @xmath57 .",
    "once the best fit parameters have been determined , the normalisation of the luminosity function , @xmath41 is then determined by matching the parametric estimate of the luminosity function to the observed number density of galaxies using eq .",
    "[ eq : norm ] .    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the number of galaxies , @xmath60 is the fraction of sky covered by the survey and @xmath61 represents the colour selection function obtained by summing the product of @xmath48 and @xmath49 over all galaxies in the sample .",
    "the errors on the gaussian parameters @xmath42 and @xmath62 are calculated using the 1@xmath62 error ellipsoid obtained by performing the minimisation using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method .",
    "the main sources of error on @xmath41 come from cosmic variance and the covariance of @xmath41 with @xmath42 . in @xmath13 [ sec :",
    "cosmicvar ] we will show that for a large survey such as 2slaq , cosmic variance is unlikely to be a dominant systematic . the errors for @xmath41 quoted throughout the paper are therefore calculated from the 1@xmath62 errors on @xmath42 .",
    "the dependance of the luminosity function on redshift is first considered and possible sources of systematic errors to these estimates examined later in this section .",
    "we examine the redshift evolution of the 2slaq lrg luminosity function in four redshift bins between redshift 0.4 and 0.8 .",
    "the luminosity function estimates are obtained using the @xmath39 estimator described above . due to",
    "the different absolute magnitude ranges in each redshift bin , no @xmath40 fits to the data points are shown as the inferred parameters would not be comparable .         in the left - hand panel of figure [ fig : lfbins ]",
    "we plot the luminosity function in four redshift bins after k correcting to redshift 0 using the 12gyr maraston composite model . the number density of galaxies is found to increase slightly with redshift particularly in the brightest absolute magnitude bins . in the faintest bins",
    "there is a drop in the observed number density .",
    "as lrgs are known to be some of the brightest objects in the universe and our survey performs an lrg selection , we would expect a drop in the number density of such systems at faint magnitudes .",
    "downsizing in the star formation of early type systems , is an effect that is already well observed .",
    "the fainter galaxies are expected to be less massive and therefore bluer due to their higher specific star formation rates and such objects are excluded from our sample by the colour selection criteria which only select out the brightest and reddest objects .",
    "the v@xmath45 method used to evaluate luminosity functions already accounts for those galaxies that may be missing from our sample due to the observational limits set by the survey .",
    "it does not however account for photometric uncertainties in the sample which we study in detail in @xmath13 [ sec : err ] .",
    "it is possible that genuine lrgs may be scattered out across the colour selection boundaries due to their large photometric errors rendering the sample incomplete at the faint end . in order to demonstrate that the downturn we see at the faint - end of our luminosity function estimates is not due to any such incompleteness , we plot in figure [ fig : distance ] the normalised histogram of the perpendicular distance of the faintest 2slaq lrgs with @xmath63 from the d@xmath64 selection line .",
    "most of these objects that appear faint and are likely to have large photometric errors , are seen to lie very close to the selection line - i.e. at a distance of @xmath80 .",
    "this distribution therefore suggests that there are also likely to be large numbers of faint galaxies on the other side of the d@xmath64 selection .",
    "any photometric errors would thus scatter more galaxies into the sample than are being scattered out resulting in an overprediction in the number density of the faint galaxies that are close to the flux limit of the survey .",
    "we therefore conclude that the faint - end downturn seen in our luminosity function estimates is genuine and not due to any incompleteness induced by the photometric errors .",
    "we have also seen in figure [ fig : colourz ] how the red sequence is truncated in the lowest redshift bin due to the redshift dependant colour selection .",
    "this is what leads to a drop in the number density in the lowest redshift bin relative to the other bins which is not due to any evolution in the underlying galaxy population .     from the d@xmath64 selection line.,width=321 ]    in the right - hand panel of figure [ fig : lfbins ] , we plot the luminosity functions after correcting for passive evolution assuming the same maraston model .",
    "the luminosity functions change little on inclusion of this evolutionary correction suggesting it is small in these redshift ranges but in general the data points for galaxies with @xmath65 in the different redshift bins now agree better .",
    "we are confident that incompleteness does not affect this bright galaxy sample and these results therefore suggest that this lrg population is evolving consistently with the assumptions of a passive evolution model .      in this section",
    "we examine potential sources of systematic error that could bias the luminosity function estimates presented above .      in order to assess the bias that photometric errors will introduce into the luminosity function estimate",
    ", we cut our sample at @xmath33 and calculate the luminosity function for this reduced sample of galaxies . note that in @xmath13 [ sec : photerr ] we have already drawn attention to the fact that previous studies @xcite have shown that fainter than @xmath66 , galaxy samples selected through single and multi - epoch photometry differ considerably .",
    "the single - epoch magnitude errors are also found to be systematically underestimated .",
    "the luminosity functions for the entire sample as well as the @xmath33 sample are plotted in figure [ fig : photerr ] along with gaussian fits to these derived using @xmath40 minimisation . only the bright - end of the luminosity function for the entire sample",
    "is shown as the sample with small photometric errors has no galaxies in the faintest absolute magnitude bins and we want to compare the two luminosity functions over the same absolute magnitude range .",
    "the @xmath33 sample has 2131 galaxies as opposed to the 8625 galaxies in the entire sample .",
    "the space densities from the @xmath33 sample have therefore been renormalised by the fraction of galaxies in the complete sample that contribute at each absolute magnitude bin .",
    "the @xmath40 fit to the reduced sample with small photometric errors yields values of @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 where the normalisation , @xmath41 for the @xmath33 sample has also been corrected for the smaller space density of this sample . in this case",
    "however , a constant average correction factor is used rather than the absolute magnitude dependent corrections applied to the @xmath39 data points in order to ensure that the shape of the gaussian is maintained .",
    "the @xmath40 fit to the entire sample on the other hand gives @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "for which photometric errors are thought to be insignificant along with gaussian fits to both .",
    "only the bright - end of the luminosity function for the entire sample is shown in order to ensure that the gaussian fits are made over the same absolute magnitude range.,width=321 ]    as can be seen , the faintest galaxies in terms of absolute magnitude are removed from our sample on applying the @xmath24-band cut , as they typically have larger photometric errors .",
    "however , the two luminosity functions are remarkabely similar in shape and there is evidence for a faint - end downturn even for the sample with small photometric errors .",
    "the space density at the bright - end is also lower for our sample with small photometric errors even after renormalisation suggesting that photometric errors affect galaxies at all absolute magnitudes . the space density for the entire sample is found to be about a factor of two larger due to galaxies being scattered into the sample due to their large photometric errors .",
    "we have already shown that more galaxies are likely to be scattered in across the colour selection boundaries than are scattered out ( figure [ fig : distance ] ) .",
    "these galaxies are bluer than more typical lrgs but appear red due to the photometric errors .",
    "many of their spectra show evidence for the presence of strong emission lines suggesting that they are star - forming and this has already been found by @xcite .",
    "one of the main drawbacks of the v@xmath45 estimator is that it can suffer from biases due to cosmic variance .",
    "as massive galaxies such as the ones in this sample are thought to be strongly clustered , the evolution in their number density will be very sensitive to large - scale structure .",
    "traditionally , this has posed a problem for many small surveys but the 2slaq survey should cover a significant enough volume to make this an unlikely source of problem for the lrgs being studied . in order to test this hypothesis ,",
    "we split the lrg sample by declination and seperate galaxies with dec @xmath73 and dec @xmath74 .",
    "this results in two smaller samples with 4340 and 4285 galaxies respectively .",
    "a luminosity function is then calculated for each of these subsamples as well as the total luminosity function for the 2slaq sample .",
    "these are plotted in figure [ fig : cosmicvar ] .",
    "no notable differences can be seen in the three luminosity function estimates confirming that cosmic variance is not a dominant systematic in this sample .          in order to test whether the choice of spectral evolution model used to compute k+e corrections significantly affects the estimate of the luminosity function , we compute luminosity functions for all the 2slaq galaxies between redshift 0.4 and 0.8 using the 12gyr maraston composite model as well as a pegase burst model , a pegase model with an exponentially declining star formation history with @xmath75gyr and a cb07 model with an exponentially declining star formation history with @xmath75gyr .",
    "both pegase models have an age of 11gyr while the cb07 model has a formation redshift of 3 corresponding to an age 11.35gyr in our chosen cosmology .",
    "the results are illustrated in figure [ fig : model ] and the best - fit gaussian parameters to these luminosity functions summarised in table [ tab : model ] .",
    "both the pegase burst and maraston models have similar ages and star formation histories .",
    "the difference between them is the introduction of a metallicity poor sub - component to the maraston model and the use of improved stellar librarires in order to better match the observed colours of lrgs .",
    "however , it can be seen from figure [ fig : model ] ( left panel and right , top ) that there is very little difference in the luminosity function estimate obtained from using these two models .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from figure [ fig : ndens ] we can see that our work agrees well with that of @xcite and @xcite and shows that the most massive galaxies were already well assembled at redshift 0.8 and there is little evidence for their number density having changed since then .",
    "@xcite on the other hand find some evolution in the number density of massive galaxies with redshift albeit mild up to @xmath76 .",
    "the differing comoving number densities for the different samples can be attributed to the fact that these samples have all been selected in very different ways as summarised in table [ tab : surveys ] .",
    "however , it is encouraging that the comoving number density for our colour selected sample of lrgs agrees well with that inferred from the visually classified sample of @xcite .",
    "our observational results seem to match well predictions from the semi - analytical models of @xcite .",
    "these models follow the merging history of dark matter halos generated by the extended press - schechter formalism .",
    "the baryonic physics is modelled according to the prescriptions of @xcite and references therein .",
    "this model predicts that the number density of massive galaxies is almost constant upto redshifts of @xmath81 as the number density of galaxies entering a certain mass bin from lower mass bins is counteracted by the number density of galaxies leaving that mass bin for a higher mass bin .",
    "if this were the case , we would expect the number density of galaxies in the highest mass bin to decrease as a function of redshift even if it is constant in the intermediate mass bins .",
    "we compute the comoving number density in the higher mass bin of @xmath77 and in our two redshift bins - @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the number densities per unit dex in stellar mass thus obtained are @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively .",
    "therefore there is no evidence that the comoving number density of the most massive galaxies is decreasing with increasing redshift . the agreement between our data points and the @xcite models shown in figure [ fig : ndens ]",
    "should therefore be treated with caution as the constant number density of massive galaxies in the models , is only maintained due to a fine - tuning of objects between mass bins and we find no evidence that this fine - tuning actually occurs .",
    "our results also do not match at all those generated from models based on the millennium simulations @xcite . in these models ,",
    "agn feedback is invoked to shut off star formation after a characteristic mass scale in order to reproduce the observed colour - bimodality and luminosity function at redshift 0 . as a consequence ,",
    "the downsizing in star formation is reproduced but the growth of massive galaxies at high redshifts of greater than 0.5 is prohibited and dry mergers become the most dominant mechanism for mass growth in such galaxies .",
    "this is clearly inconsistent with our observations which suggest not only that significant star formation in massive galaxies has ceased at a redshift of 0.8 but also that these galaxies were already well assembled at these redshifts .",
    "the main difference between the @xcite and @xcite models is the feedback with respect to agn activity rather than the fact that the former follows a numerical simulation for the evolution of the dark matter halos whereas the latter relies on an analytical approach . if cooling is suppressed , the efficiency of massive galaxy formation at early epochs is much lower accounting for the lower number densities in the @xcite models .",
    "we also note that the @xcite models are computed from the millennium simulations , which use a cosmology with @xmath82=0.9 , whereas the @xcite models have been updated for this work with the later wmap5 cosmology with @xmath82=0.8 @xcite .",
    "as the agn activity affects the star formation history of the galaxy , we conclude that the star formation and quenching mechanisms invoked in the different galaxy formation models need to be revisited in light of our new constraints on the very high mass end of the stellar mass function .",
    "@xcite on the other hand have proposed a way in which to bring about the anti - hierarchical formation of the baryonic component of galaxies in models while still working within the framework of the @xmath6cdm cosmology .",
    "this is essentially done by invoking feedback from supernovae as well as the nuclear activity in massive galaxies .",
    "these processes slow down star formation in the least massive halos and drive gas outflows thereby increasing the stellar to dark matter ratio in the more massive halos and ensuring that the physical processes acting on baryons are able to effectively reverse the order of formation of galaxies compared to dark matter halos .",
    "these models have already been shown to match the local k - band luminosity function of massive galaxies @xcite as well as the luminosity function at redshifts of @xmath81.5 @xcite .",
    "reproducing our observational results for the most massive galaxies at intermediate redshifts would therefore be an important test for these models .",
    "recently @xcite have also proposed an alternative galaxy formation model whereby bursts of star formation can occur in massive galaxies without the need for violent merging events .",
    "these authors suggest that the massive galaxies , which reside in the centers of filaments , are fed by cold gas streams that penetrate the shock heated media of massive dark matter halos thereby inducing star formation .",
    "given the small errorbars in our estimates of the comoving number density compared to previous studies and the fact that our sample has secure spectroscopic redshifts for all objects and a massive area that reduces errors due to cosmic variance , this new observational result presents a significant challenge for many current models of galaxy formation and requires a reinvestigation of the feedback mechanisms involved .",
    "this paper has examined the evolution of the optical and near infra - red luminosity function as well as the stellar mass function of 8625 lrgs from the 2slaq survey between redshift 0.4 and 0.8 .",
    "we have demonstrated the unique position of 2slaq lrgs among other massive galaxy samples due to the large volume probed by the sample as well the availability of spectroscopic redshifts for all galaxies and near infra - red data for @xmath875% of them .",
    "this has allowed us to probe the very high - mass end of the stellar mass function which places the most stringent constraints on models of galaxy formation .",
    "we have also used the spectral evolution models of @xcite which are the most accurate models of lrgs to date to study the evolution of these objects although our conclusions change little if other models are used instead .",
    "specifically we draw the following conclusions :    * the evolution of the optical luminosity function of lrgs between redshifts 0.4 and 0.8 is consistent with the assumptions of a passive evolution model where the stars were formed at high redshift with little or no evidence for recent episodes of star formation . *",
    "a downturn is seen at the faint end of the lrg luminosity function due to the effects of downsizing in the star formation .",
    "the faintest galaxies are expected to be less massive and therefore bluer than the bright objects and such objects are excluded from the lrg sample due to the imposed colour selection of these objects which selects only the reddest galaxies .",
    "* we find that photometric errors may induce a significant bias into our sample of lrgs and scatter galaxies both in and out of our sample across the colour selection boundaries .",
    "we show that more galaxies are likely to be scattered into the sample than are scattered out leading to an overprediction of the observed space density but the shape of the luminosity function does not change if we remove the galaxies with large photometric errors .",
    "* the lrg luminosity function is found to be unaffected by cosmic variance due to the large volume occupied by the sample . *",
    "the luminosity function is also relatively insensitive to the choice of spectral evolution model and the metallicity although models with some residual star formation shift the luminosity function towards fainter absolute magnitudes . *",
    "the stellar mass function for these lrgs for @xmath83 also shows little evidence for evolution between redshifts 0.4 and 0.8 suggesting that these most massive systems were already well assembled at redshifts of 0.8 .",
    "this is consistent with the emerging picture of downsizing in the mass assembly of massive galaxies . *",
    "the stellar mass function estimate is also relatively insensitive to the choice of spectral evolution model assumed in the calculation of @xmath39 .",
    "however , different choices of the stellar initial mass function will shift the mass function estimate as found in previous studies . *",
    "the comoving number density of lrgs with @xmath84 has changed little between redshifts 0.8 and 0.4 . the same is true for lrgs with @xmath85 .",
    "this is consistent with other observational results for massive galaxy samples and does not agree with the predictions of most current galaxy formation models .",
    "we find that the models of @xcite may be promising in matching our observations although they are yet to be compared with massive galaxy samples at intermediate redshifts .",
    "overall , our results support the emerging picture of downsizing in both the star formation and mass assembly of early type galaxies and present a significant challenge for current models of galaxy formation .",
    "we have shown our findings to be robust to changes in spectral evolution models , cosmic variance and photometric errors and conclude that these new observations of the most massive and most luminous galaxies in our universe will need to be reconciled with the models if progress is to be made in the field of massive galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "we thank david wake for many useful discussions .",

    "the most common parametric estimator of the luminosity function is that of @xcite ( sty ) .",
    "a parametric form is assumed for the luminosity function e.g. a gaussian as in this paper .",
    "the parameters , @xmath86 are then solved for by maximising the likelihood :          where @xmath91 is the apparent magnitude incompleteness function for objects with absolute magnitude , @xmath92 and redshift , @xmath93 .",
    "this incompleteness occurs due to various reasons .",
    "firstly , not all galaxies targetted in a survey will have redshifts determined succesfully . @xcite",
    "have considered this incompleteness function for 2slaq lrgs using carefully constructed 2slaq survey masks .",
    "although they find a slight dependance of this incompleteness function on the ( g - r ) colour , including this functional dependance as opposed to considering a constant incompleteness of 76.1% introduces less than a 1% change in their luminosity function estimate .",
    "we therefore assume a constant redshift incompleteness of 76.1% that is independant of both the redshift and the absolute magnitude .",
    "in the case of a colour - selected sample such as 2slaq however , there may be additional sources of incompleteness as the space density of these galaxies is a function of both the flux limit and the colours .",
    "the 2slaq lrgs at different redshifts occupy different distributions in the colour absolute magnitude plane due to the redshift dependant colour selection .",
    "this colour selection could introduce an incompleteness function that is both a function of absolute magnitude as well as redshift and this selection function has to be explicitly included in the integral in eq [ eq : pi ] .",
    "we have checked that using the absolute magnitude averaged selection function rather than the 2d function @xmath91 , makes very little difference to the sty estimate of the luminosity function . in this case , the galaxy incompleteness can be taken outside the integral and the likelihood in the sty method adjusted directly e.g. @xcite .      where the weights associated with each individual galaxy are @xmath95 .",
    "we initially calculate luminosity functions assuming @xmath96 for the entire sample and this is shown by the dashed line in figure [ fig : sty ] .",
    "this clearly illustrates that the v@xmath45 and sty estimators differ considerably from each other at the faint - end .",
    "the sty fit parameters are @xmath97 for the entire sample and these values are very different to those derived from the @xmath40-fits in @xmath13 [ sec : lf ] .",
    "it has already been noted in this paper that fainter than @xmath98 , photometric errors may become significant in scattering lrgs both in and out of the colour selection boundaries .",
    "this analysis therefore suggests that the sty estimator is particularly sensitive to photometric errors for colour selected samples and the weights @xmath99 start to differ significantly from 1 for galaxies with large photometric errors . in order to calculate these weights",
    ", one would have to do a monte carlo simulation of galaxies assuming a certain spectral evolution model , add noise to this simulation and then look at the completeness function @xmath100 for each galaxy by considering which galaxies are selected on applying the 2slaq colour selection criteria e.g. @xcite .",
    "this is the subject of future work .",
    "the sty estimator in its traditional form is clearly biased for a colour - selected sample with non - negligible photometric errors and for this reason , it has not been presented in the main body of this paper .",
    "we note that when we move to high redshift bins where the galaxies are generally brighter and the photometric errors smaller , the sty estimator and @xmath39 estimator agree very well as it is clearly reasonable in these regimes to assume @xmath96 ."
