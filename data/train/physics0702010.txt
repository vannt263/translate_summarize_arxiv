    "networks  in particular large networks with many nodes and links  are attracting widespread attention .",
    "the classic reviews @xcite with their primary focus on structural properties have been followed up by more recent ones addressing the role of dynamics , such as spreading and synchronisation processes on networks , as well as the role of weights and mesoscopic structures , i.e. cliques ( fully connected subgraphs ) and communities ( groups of densely interconnected nodes ) , within networks @xcite .",
    "although several different measures for characterising networks have been presented , for example in a recent survey @xcite , the simple concept of vertex degree remains unrivalled in its ability to capture fundamental network properties .",
    "when comparing the degrees of connected vertices , however , one often finds that they are correlated , a quality that gives rise to a rich set of phenomena @xcite .",
    "degree correlations constitute a central role in network characterisation and modelling but , in addition to being important in their own right , also have substantial consequences for dynamical processes unfolding on networks . given the increasing current interest in network dynamics , understanding structural correlations remains important and timely .",
    "in this paper we provide a detailed mathematical formalism for modelling networks with correlations .",
    "it is built around a statistical description of inter - node linkages as opposed to single - node degrees .",
    "most works devoted to analytical calculations of correlations in models have been performed only for particular cases  @xcite .",
    "we provide a brief overview of degree correlations for network structure and dynamics in section [ sec : correlations ] and discuss how the work presented relates to existing studies .",
    "section  [ sec : notation ] contains the notation used throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "we highlight the importance of acknowledging these correlations in section  [ sec : saramaki ] through reviewing a model of network growth proposed by saramki and kaski  @xcite ( and subsequently by evans and saramki  @xcite ) which employs random walkers to grow a network .",
    "the _ link - space _ formalism , which lies at the core of the paper , is introduced in section [ sec : linkspace ] .",
    "the formalism comprises a master equation description of the evolution of a very specific matrix construction which we term the _ link - space matrix_. the formalism can be implemented in a number of ways . to demonstrate its use , we apply it to two well - known , non - equilibrium examples , namely random - attachment and barabsi - albert ( ba ) preferential - attachment networks @xcite in section  [ sec : linkspace ] and solve the so - called link - space matrix analytically for these models . in section  [ sec : linkspace ]",
    ", we also apply it to the classical equilibrium random graph of erds and rnyi  @xcite ( er ) using some of the ideas discussed in @xcite which , interestingly , requires a full , time - dependent solution of the link - space master equations . the cumulative link - space introduced in section  [ sec : linkspace ] aids comparison between simulated and analytic link - space matrices and could ,",
    "in principle , be applied to empirical networks to better ascertain their degree correlations .",
    "analytic derivation of link - space matrices allows detailed analysis of the degree - degree correlations present within these networks as is demonstrated in section [ sec : degrees ] . within section  [ sec : degrees ]",
    ", we also show how , for arbitrary degree distribution , a link - space matrix can be derived which has no correlations present , i.e. the link - space is representative of a perfectly non - assortative network with that degree distribution .",
    "we then consider the counter - intuitive prospect of finding steady states of decaying networks in section [ sec : decay ] . in section  [ sec : redner ] , we discuss the growing network with redirection ( gnr ) model of krapivsky and redner  @xcite . in section  [ sec : model ] , we introduce a simple one - parameter network growth algorithm with a similar redirection process which is able to produce a wide range of degree distributions .",
    "the model is interesting in its own right in the sense that it makes use of only local information about node degrees . here",
    "the link - space formalism allows us to identify the transition point at higher exponent degree distibutions switch to lower exponent distributions with respect to the ba model .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : lsconclusion ] .",
    "a discussion of correlations might naturally start with the phenomenon of _ clustering_. the highly influential paper of barabsi and albert and many subsequent papers focussed on the modelling and analysis of models which replicate power - law degree distributions observed in many real - world systems @xcite .",
    "however , the ba preferential attachment mechanism lacks certain key features observed in many of those systems , one such feature being _",
    "clustering_. clustering is an important local statistic in many networks and reflects the connectedness of neighbours of a node . in a social context , if person @xmath3 is friends with both @xmath4 and @xmath5 , one might expect some kind of link between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the measurement of the connectedness of neighbours of nodes is the clustering coefficient .",
    "this is often averaged over all nodes and a single value is given as the clustering coefficient of the network  @xcite .",
    "an explicit example is given in figure  [ fig : clustering1 ] .",
    "the node labelled @xmath1 has @xmath6 neighbours ( in this case @xmath7 ) . between these",
    "there could be a possible @xmath8 undirected links of which @xmath9 exist .",
    "for this example , @xmath10 links exist out of the possible @xmath11 between the neighbours of node @xmath1 .",
    "the clustering of node @xmath1 is given by @xmath12 and would be @xmath13 for our example .",
    "the clustering nature of a network can also be expressed as the average over all nodes of degree @xmath14 giving a clustering distribution ( or _ spectrum _ ) , @xmath15 .",
    "node @xmath1 has @xmath7 neighbours which could potentially share 10 links between them .",
    "only three out of these @xmath11 possible links exist between the neighbours of @xmath1 .",
    "its clustering coefficient is then expressed @xmath16.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    as noted by klemm and eguluz , in a ba network , the average clustering of a given node is independent of its degree @xcite , in contrast to the findings of fronczak _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and tends to zero in the large - size ( thermodynamic ) limit .",
    "a network model which does exhibit high clustering is that of watts and strogatz  @xcite in which a random rewiring process is carried out on an initially regular lattice .",
    "the networks generated by such a process feature short average shortest path lengths between node pairs ( the _ small - world _",
    "however , these networks do not exhibit a power - law degree distribution .",
    "subsequently , there have been many efforts to build models which can encompass both of these features such as the non - equlibrium growing network model proposed by klemm and eguluz which features deactivation of a nodes availibility to be connected to @xcite .",
    "other models such as that of holme and kim @xcite and that introduced by toivonen _",
    "_ @xcite modified the original ba preferential attachment mechanism , allowing further links between the new node and neighbours of the preferentially selected node .",
    "the social network model of toivonen _ et al . _ produced communities with dense internal connections .",
    "_ formulated a scaling assumption and a mean - field theory of clustering in growing scale - free networks and applied it to the holme and kim mechanism @xcite .",
    "as discussed by bogu and pastor - satorras , clustering in networks is closely related to degree correlations @xcite .",
    "infact , based on the work of szab _ et al .",
    "_ , barrat and pastor - satorras introduced a framework for computing the rate equation for two vertex correlations in the continuous degree and continuous time approximation @xcite .",
    "we shall now describe these degree correlations .",
    "vertex degree correlations are measures of the statistical dependence of the degrees of neighbouring vertices in a network . in general , @xmath17-vertex degree correlations , or @xmath17 point correlations , can be fully characterised by the conditional probability distribution that a vertex of degree @xmath18 is connected to a set of @xmath17 vertices with degrees @xmath19 .",
    "two and three point correlations are of particular interest in complex networks as they can be related to network assortativity and clustering respectively . more specifically , two vertex degree correlations ( two point correlations ) can be expressed as conditional probability @xmath20 that a vertex of degree @xmath14 is connected to a vertex of degree @xmath21 .",
    "similarly , three vertex degree correlations ( three point correlations ) can be fully characterised by the conditional probability distribution @xmath22 that a vertex of degree @xmath14 is connected to both a vertex of degree @xmath21 and a vertex of degree @xmath23 .",
    "this implies that the degrees of neighbouring nodes are not statistically independent .",
    "reliable estimation of @xmath20 and @xmath22 requires a large amount of data and , in practice , one often resorts to related measures . instead of @xmath20 , the average degree of nearest neighbours , @xmath24 ,",
    "is often measured .",
    "this can be formally related to @xmath20 @xcite . if @xmath24 increases with @xmath14 ,",
    "high degree vertices tend to connect to high degree vertices .",
    "a network with this property would be described as being _ assortative _ or displaying positive degree correlations .",
    "if @xmath24 decreases with @xmath14 , high degree vertices tend to connect to low degree vertices ( _ disassortative _ or negatively correlated ) @xcite .",
    "an alternative to @xmath24 is to use a normalised pearson s correlation coefficient of adjacent vertex degrees providing a single number measure of assortativity as suggested by newman to further classify networks @xcite .",
    "these approaches are discussed in more detail in section  [ sec : degrees ] .",
    "to characterise three point correlations , instead of using @xmath22 , one can employ the clustering spectrum @xmath15 , which can be related to @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "in many real world networks such as the internet  @xcite , the clustering spectrum is a decreasing function of degree and while this is sometimes interpreted as a signature of hierarchical structure in a network , soffer and vzquez suggested that this is a consequence of degree - degree ( two point ) correlations that enter the definition of the standard clustering coefficient @xcite .",
    "the authors introduced a different definition for the clustering coefficient that does not have the degree - correlation ` bias ' , i.e. a three - point correlation measure that filters out two - point correlations .",
    "following the suggestion of maslov et al .",
    "@xcite that these phenomenon might arise from topological constraints rather than evolutionary mechanisms , park and newman demonstrated that dissasortative degree correlations observed in the internet could be explained via the restriction of there being no double edges between nodes @xcite .",
    "in contrast , social networks have been found to be assortative @xcite .",
    "similarly , catazaro _ et al . _ observed that the network of scientific collaborations was assortative and presented a model to reproduce this feature @xcite .",
    "functional processes occurring on networks are influenced by degree correlations , highlighting the importance of their role in complex networks .",
    "eguluz and klemm considered highly clustered scale - free networks and showed that correlations play an important role in epidemic spreading @xcite .",
    "the time average of the fraction of infected individuals in the steady - state undergoes a phase transition at a finite critical infection probability .",
    "they related this critical threshold to the transmission probability and the mean degree of nearest neighbours of all nodes in the system @xmath26 , the conjectured criterion for epidemic spreading being related to the product of the two .",
    "the value @xmath26 scales with system size in their highly clustered scale - free network slower than in the random scale - free which is a byproduct of the dissasortativity of the system .",
    "consequently , whereas in random scale - free networks in which viruses with extremely low spreading probabilities can prevail , the absence of connections between highly connected nodes in highly clustered scale - free networks protects the system against epidemics @xcite .",
    "interestingly , bogn _ et al .",
    "_ assert that any scale - free network of appropriate exponent will have diverging @xmath26 in the thermodynamic ( infinite size ) limit , resulting in no threshold properties for epidemic spreading regardless of the correlations within the network @xcite in contrast to the earlier suggestion of bogn and pastor - satorras  @xcite .",
    "brede and sinha induced correlations to erds - rnyi and scale - free networks by rewiring them appropriately to examine their dynamic stability @xcite .",
    "each node had an associated variable who s evolution was governed by some non - linear function of the variables associated with neighbouring nodes .",
    "they mapped the adjacency matrices into jacobian matrices and examined the largest eigenvectors , reflecting the decay rates of perturbations of the nodes variables about their equilibrium states .",
    "they found that positive correlations within the network reduced the dynamical stability @xcite .",
    "similarly , bernardo _ et al .",
    "_ induced negative degree correlations in scale - free networks whose links couple non - linear oscillators . through analysis of the eigenratio ( ratio of the eigenvalues ) of the laplacian of such networks , they found that network synchronisability improved as the network was made more dissassortative @xcite .",
    "based on this result , they conjectured that negative degree correlations may emerge spontaneously as the networked system attempts to become more stable @xcite .",
    "the same authors found similar results to hold also for weighted networks @xcite .",
    "maslov and sneppen found that in regulatory networks , links between highly connected proteins were relatively rare increasing the robustness of the network to perturbations through  localising deletous perturbations \" @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of berg _ et al .",
    "_ whose model of the evolution of protein interaction networks exhibited disassortativity consistent with their empirical findings @xcite .",
    "krapivsky _ et al .",
    "_ used a master equation method , in which rate equations for the densities of nodes of a given degree are employed , to investigate the steady state of the ba preferential attachment mechanism  @xcite .",
    "this is a general method which can be applied to various growing network models . to extend the method to encompass two - point correlations , krapivsky and redner applied the approach to the number @xmath27 of nodes with total degree @xmath14 connected to ancestor nodes of total degree @xmath28 in a _ directed _ network  @xcite .",
    "they solved analytically the master equations for the steady - state of a specific directed network growth model , namely the growing with redirection algorithm  @xcite which is further discussed in section [ sec : redner ] and is similar to the mixture model introduced in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "bogu and pastor - satorras considered a link orientated description of two point correlations . for",
    "_ undirected _ graphs , they introduced a symmetric matrix whose elements @xmath29 represent the number of links connecting nodes of degree @xmath14 to nodes of degree @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "bogu and pastor - satorras related this matrix to the joint degree distribution @xmath30 but noted that finite size effects make empirical evaluation of the matrix difficult , suggesting the use of the spectrum @xmath31 as a more suitable observable . here",
    ", we introduce a similar matrix construction which can be applied to both the undirected _ and _ directed scenarios .",
    "we call this the _ link - space _ matrix .",
    "we show that it is possible to construct master equations to model the evolution of this matrix which can be applied to a wide variety of network evolution algorithms retaining important degree correlations which can be critical to the network s development .",
    "this framework is termed the _ link - space formalism _ and is introduced in section  [ sec : linkspace ] . in certain cases , these master equations can be solved analytically providing a full time - dependent solution or a steady - state solution of the link - space matrix of the network . from these analytically derived link - space matrices both the degree and joint degree distributions",
    "can be obtained allowing accurate analysis of degree correlations .",
    "the formalism also allows the derivation of the form of networks of predetermined correlation properties such as a perfectly non - assortative network ( section  [ sec : degrees ] ) and the derivation of the steady - state solutions to network decay algorithms ( section  [ sec : decay ] ) .",
    "the formalism can also be employed in its iterative guise to provide approximations to the steady - state when an analytic solution is not possible such as for the mixture model of section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "one and two - point correlations have natural physical counterparts within the network , specifically the nodes and links .",
    "the one - point correlations @xmath32 are simply related to the fraction of nodes in the network with degree @xmath14 . as described in detail within this paper ,",
    "two - point correlations @xmath30 are related to the fraction of links within a network connecting nodes of degree @xmath14 with nodes of degree @xmath21 , hence the term _ link - space_. one can extend the analysis to three - point correlations , @xmath33 .",
    "this would be related to the number ( fraction ) of pairs of links within a network sharing a common node of degree @xmath14 , the remaining link ends being connected to nodes of degrees @xmath21 and @xmath23 and all possible ` open triangles ' within the network would have to be considered .",
    "clearly , the process can be extended to arbitrary @xmath17-point correlations although the physical interpretation of the appropriate measurable quantities will become increasingly obscure .",
    "throughout the subsequent discussions , we shall use the following notation : @xmath34",
    "the use of random walkers to generate networks was introduced by saramki and kaski  @xcite . in their model , as in many non - equilibrium evolving networks , one new node is attached to the existing network at each timestep with @xmath35 undirected links .",
    "the simplest implementation of their growth algorithm attaches this new node to the existing network component with @xmath36 links as follows : +    1 .",
    "select a node at random within the existing network .",
    "2 .   perform a two - step random walk .",
    "3 .   establish ( undirected ) links between the nodes arrived at within the existing network and the new node .",
    "note that a link is not established between the new node and the initial node of the random walk .",
    "the generalisation is clear for @xmath37 links per new node attached . to summarize , a random walk of length @xmath35 steps",
    "is performed within the existing network from a randomly chosen start point , and a link between the new node and each of the nodes reached in the random walk is formed with the exception of the start point .",
    "+     the degree distribution of an example network using the saramki / kaski algorithm grown to @xmath38 nodes.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    certainly this yields results comparable to the scale - free preferential attachment of the ba model as shown in figure  [ fig : saramaki ] . however , the analytic approximations derived by saramki and kaski in reference  @xcite do not hold in all cases .",
    "their analysis is as follows .",
    "consider choosing some vertex labeled @xmath39 initially ( at random ) within the existing network comprising @xmath40 nodes .",
    "this occurs with probability : @xmath41    we now wish to consider the probability of moving to a neighbour vertex labeled @xmath42 after one step of the random walk . using bayes theorem , @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes arriving at node @xmath42 after one step , @xmath45 denotes the probability of arriving at at @xmath42 if node @xmath39 is the initial vertex chosen and @xmath46 is the conditional probability that , given we have arrived at @xmath42 , we originated at @xmath39 .",
    "the value @xmath45 can be trivially written @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the degree of vertex @xmath39 .",
    "so far so good",
    ". however , the next justification is somewhat misunderstood .",
    "it is often thought  @xcite that the conditional probability @xmath46 can be written @xmath49 which combined with the above yields : @xmath50 this compares to the the ba preferential attachment probability for attaching to a particular node of degree @xmath1 : @xmath51 such that the probability of attaching to a node is proportional to its degree .     a trivial example network.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    to understand the problems with this analysis ,",
    "consider a real system of nodes , as described in figure  [ fig : simplenet ] .",
    "we can write the probability associated with arriving at node @xmath42 after a random walk of one step in terms of the initial node selected being one of the neighbours of @xmath42 and the subsequent probability of moving to node @xmath42 : @xmath52 clearly this is not the same as the earlier expression ( [ eqn : wrong ] ) . nor",
    "should it be .",
    "the earlier expression would yield different results depending on which node was labeled @xmath39 which is clearly a nonsense .",
    "another interesting assumption often made is that because the initial node is chosen at random , its vertex degree will be distributed similarly to that of the entire network  @xcite .",
    "if this is so , ( [ eqn : wrong ] ) can be written in terms of arriving at a particular of node of degree @xmath1 after randomly choosing an initial vertex and moving at random to one of its neighbours : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the mean degree of the existing network component . even averaging over all nodes of degree @xmath1 , and ( incorrectly ) assuming that on average the neighbours of these nodes are distributed identically to the network as a whole",
    ", this would have implied the entirely different result @xmath55 we will discuss a similar expression in section  [ sec : model ] and the mean degree of nearest neighbours in section  [ sec : degrees ] .",
    "in fact , the inherent degree - degree correlations are such that they can not be ignored .",
    "we can see this by looking at an example network grown to @xmath56 nodes using the simplest form ( @xmath36 ) of the saramki algorithm outlined earlier .",
    "having generated such a network , we shall investigate the probability of arriving at a node of degree @xmath1 after a random walk of one and two steps and compare these to the preferential attachment probability .",
    "transforming the adjacency matrix of the network generated by the algorithm into a markov - chain transition matrix  @xcite ( dividing the columns by their sums ) we can look at all possible random walks from all possible starting points for a number of steps .",
    "this is simply acheived by premultiplying a vector with all elements @xmath57 by the transition matrix .",
    "the result is a vector containing the probabilities of arriving at each node after a random walk of one step from random initial node . multiplying this vector by the transition matrix again , provides the probabilities of arriving at each node in the network after a two - step random walk . knowing the degrees of all the nodes in the network , it is then straight - forward to look at the probability of arriving at a degree @xmath1 node after a one or two step random walk . whilst the degree distribution is described by @xmath58 which is the same as @xmath59 for selecting nodes at random ,",
    "the ba preferential attachment probability is described in terms of individual node probabilities @xmath60 .",
    "we use the first two parts of ( [ eqn : picalc ] ) to infer the probability of arriving at a specific node of degree @xmath1 after one or two steps .",
    "the preferential attachment probability would correspond to an infinite random walk .",
    "the comparison is illustrated in figure  [ fig : correlation1 ] . clearly , a one - step random walk is biased towards high degree nodes in comparison to preferential attachment whilst a two step random walk is biased towards low degree nodes .",
    "the probability of arriving at a specific node of degree @xmath1 after a random walk of one and two steps compared to the preferential attachment probability .",
    "this analysis has been carried out on a network comprising @xmath38 nodes grown using the saramki and kaski algorithm.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    to understand why this model yields the scale - free degree distributions equivalent to preferential attachment , we must look at the expected degree of the nodes in the existing network to which the new node is to be attached . using the same transition matrix process ,",
    "the mean degree of nodes reached after a number of steps of random walk can be calculated for a given network ( here @xmath38 nodes ) for all possible random walks from random starting positions .",
    "the expected degree of the first node in the walk is much higher than the convergent ( preferential attachment ) value , and the second lower as shown in figure  [ fig : correlation2 ] . by interpolating between these two , an approach to preferential attachment",
    "has been achieved for this network growth algorithm , even for @xmath36 links added ( 2 step random walk ) per new node .",
    "the expected degree of the node arrived at after a number of steps in a random walk from random initial node .",
    "this is performed on a realisation of the saramki - kaski network , @xmath36 for @xmath38 nodes.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    we will make use of these correlations in our proposed model ( see section  [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "we now introduce the link - space formalism which is based upon the master equation method .",
    "consider a simple , growing , non - equilibrium network in which one node is added to a network at each timestep and this node is connected to the existing network with exactly @xmath35 undirected links .",
    "the process is governed by an attachment probability _ kernel _ @xmath61 , defined as the probability that a specific , newly - introduced link attaches to any node of degree @xmath2 within the existing network . at some time @xmath62 there exist @xmath63 nodes of degree @xmath1 and we wish to compute the expected number of nodes with degree @xmath1 at time @xmath64 .",
    "the _ node - space master equations _ can be expressed in terms of the attachment kernels and are written @xmath65 since a new node of degree @xmath35 is added to the existing network at each timestep and there are no nodes with degree less than @xmath35 .",
    "so far we have said nothing about the attachment mechanism , and have made the easily geneneralisable restriction that only one node is being added per timestep with undirected links .",
    "we now follow a similar analysis , but retain the node - node linkage correlations that are inherent in many real - world systems @xcite . consider any link in a general network  we can describe it by the degrees of the two nodes that it connects .",
    "hence we can construct a matrix @xmath66 such that the element @xmath67 is equal to the number of links from nodes of degree @xmath1 to nodes of degree @xmath2 for @xmath68 at some time @xmath62 . to ease the mathematical analysis below",

    "this network will also be further analysed in section  [ sec : model ] . the link - space matrix for this network",
    "is then expressed as in ( [ eqn : explicit ] ) .",
    "note the double counting of the @xmath73 link ( @xmath74 ) . @xmath75",
    "the matrix , @xmath76 , represents a surface describing degree - degree correlations and is called the _ link - space _ matrix .",

    "we write master equations governing the evolution of the link - space matrix as the evolution of the expected number of links from @xmath1 to @xmath2 degree nodes , i.e. the number of @xmath84 links .",
    "this is the _ link - space formalism _ and is written for the ( generalisable ) case of adding one new node with @xmath35 undirected links to the existing network as @xmath85    there are a variety of ways in which both the node - space and link - space master equations can be approached .",
    "for example , a full , time - dependent solution could be investigated as in section  [ subsec : er ] or , using appropriate initial conditions , the equations can be iterated over the required timescale as in section  [ sec : model ] .",
