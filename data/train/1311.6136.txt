    "biomembranes , which delimit the boundaries of biological cells , as well as the perimeter of intra - cellular organelles , play a vital role in maintaining and regulating cellular functions  @xcite .",
    "for example , mitochondria and chloroplast are examples of specific cellular organelles that use concentration gradient of ions across their membrane to supply energy that is indispensable to biological activities .",
    "the main building blocks of biomembranes are a variety of phospholipids , glycosphingolipids and cholesterol .",
    "phospholipids and glycolipids are amphiphilic molecules consisting of two moieties : a hydrophilic head group and , typically , two hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains .",
    "when lipid molecules are dissolved in water , they spontaneously form a bilayer membrane , where the hydrocarbon tails of the two leaflets face each other and point away from the water phase , in order to avoid direct contact between the hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains and water .",
    "in addition , various types of proteins are embedded within the biomembrane , and among other roles , they mediate the transport of substances between the inside and outside of the cell .    at physiological temperatures , biomembranes are fluid .",
    "this guarantees that both lipids and proteins can freely diffuse laterally within the membrane plane .",
    "a dynamical picture of biomembranes was provided by singer and nicolson in 1972 , and their model was named the _ `` fluid mosaic model '' _  @xcite . although this model became a widely accepted standard model of biomembranes , the so - called _",
    "`` raft model '' _ proposed by simons and ikonen  @xcite in 1997 initiated a substantial debate in the community regarding the nature of structural heterogeneities of biomembranes and their implied function .    according to the fluid mosaic model , various lipids and proteins",
    "are considered to be uniformly distributed within the membrane plane , while the raft model asserts the existence of nanoscale domains consisting of cholesterol and specific phospholipids such as sphingolipid .",
    "these lipid domains together with membrane proteins are expected to act as relay stations for signaling transfer factor , and to be involved in controlling quite a number of biological processes .",
    "based on the accumulated experimental results , a definition of lipid rafts has been suggested in an international conference held in 2006  @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ membrane rafts are small ( 10200 nm ) , heterogeneous , highly dynamic , sterol and sphingolipid - enriched domains that compartmentalize cellular processes .",

    ". one of the reasons why the scientific community has been unable to settle the issue concerning the raft hypothesis is due to a lack of direct visualization of rafts in bio - membranes .",
    "nevertheless , the raft hypothesis has largely stimulated the interest of physicists and physical chemists , leading to many studies on heterogeneities and phase separation of model lipid membranes .    in this article",
    ", we review the physical phenomenon that is induced by phase separation in multi - component lipid membranes , and describe related experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "however , it should be noted with care that exactly how the observed structures in model bilayers are related to lipid rafts in biomembranes is not completely understood at present .",
    "nevertheless , the real picture of lipid rafts may become more evident as we explore physical mechanisms and concepts such as diffusion , phase separation and critical phenomena , because those mechanisms are well - defined and can be quantitatively measured and investigated in model systems .    the outline of this article is as follow .",
    "in the next section , we explain some known facts concerning lateral phase separation in multi - component membranes and review several physical models that describe it . in sec .",
    "[ sec : vesicle ] , we discuss the coupling between the lateral phase separation with membrane deformation and vesicle shape . section [ sec : hydro ] deals with hydrodynamics of fluid membranes embedded in a surrounding solvent .",
    "based on hydrodynamic arguments , we review the dynamics of lateral phase separation in sec .  [",
    "sec : separation ] , particularly focusing on domain growth - law below the transition temperature . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fluctuation ] , we summarize several results on the dynamics of concentration fluctuations above the transition temperature , and sec .",
    "[ sec : microemulsion ] is concerned with several recent attempts to view membrane rafts as two - dimensional microemulsion .",
    "finally , an outlook is provided in the last section .",
    "lipids , which are the building blocks of biomembranes , include phospholipids , glycosphingolipids , and cholesterol . typical examples of phospholipids are phosphatidylcholine ( pc ) , phosphatidylserine ( ps ) , and sphingomyelin ( sm ) .",
    "below , we shall divide lipid molecules into two categories : _ `` saturated lipids '' _ which do not contain any unsaturated bond in their hydrocarbon chains , and _",
    "`` unsaturated lipids '' _ which have at least one unsaturated bond .",
    "although cholesterol is also a lipid , hereafter we shall refer only to phospholipids or glycosphingolipids as _ `` lipids '' _ and cholesterol will retain its name .",
    "it is known that by changing temperature , single - component lipid bilayers will undergo a structural phase transition that reflects a change in the orientational order of the lipid hydrocarbon chains  @xcite . at high temperatures ,",
    "lipid bilayers are in a _",
    "`` liquid - crystalline phase '' _ , whereas at low temperatures they are in a _",
    "`` gel phase '' _ , in which the lipid molecules hardly diffuse .",
    "prior to the lipid raft hypothesis , the phase behavior of bilayers consisting of two types of lipids characterized by different transition temperatures has been investigated using various experimental methods  @xcite .",
    "since saturated lipids typically have higher phase - transition temperature than unsaturated ones , a region of two - phase coexistence appears between the liquid - crystalline and gel phases over a certain temperature range .",
    "cholesterol , on the other hand , is known to exhibit a dual effect in lipid bilayers  @xcite . in the liquid - crystalline phase cholesterol",
    "promotes the packing of hydrocarbon chains , while it disrupts the chain ordering in the gel phase . in binary mixtures of lipid and cholesterol , a mixed phase called the _",
    "`` liquid - ordered phase '' _",
    "( l@xmath0-phase ) appears when cholesterol concentration is high enough . in this phase , even though the lipid hydrocarbon chains are relatively ordered , the membrane maintains its fluidity . for intermediate cholesterol concentrations ,",
    "membranes undergo a liquid - liquid phase separation between the l@xmath0-phase and a lipid - rich phase called the",
    "_ `` liquid - disordered phase '' _ ( l@xmath1-phase ) .",
    "the latter phase is identical to the previously introduced _",
    "`` liquid - crystalline phase '' _ , and the lipid hydrocarbon chains in this phase are less ordered as compared to the l@xmath0-phase . since the minority phase forms domains as a result of phase separation ,",
    "these domains have been studied in hope to shed light on membrane rafts with whom they probably share some similarities .",
    "dietrich _ et al . _",
    "@xcite were the first to visualize liquid domains in three - component lipid bilayers .",
    "using fluorescence microscope , they observed phase - separated patterns in giant vesicles composed of unsaturated lipid , saturated lipid , and cholesterol .",
    "they demonstrated that the liquid - liquid phase separation indeed occurs because the l@xmath0-phase rich in saturated lipid and cholesterol form circular two - dimensional ( 2d ) liquid domains . following this work ,",
    "several other studies have been conducted  @xcite elucidating the phase behavior of various combinations of three - component mixtures ( unsaturated lipid / saturated lipid/ cholesterol ) as a function of temperature and composition .",
    "we note that a typical and well - studied three - component mixture is that of dopc / dppc/ cholesterol . in fig .",
    "[ fig : marrink ] , we show a visualization obtained by coarse - grained molecular dynamics simulation  @xcite of a three - component lipid bilayer membrane exhibiting a lateral phase separation between l@xmath0 and l@xmath1 phases .    for our later discussion , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : ternaryphase ] the experimentally obtained  @xcite ternary phase diagram of diphypc / dppc/ cholesterol for two different temperatures : 43@xmath2c ( top ) and 16@xmath2c ( bottom ) .",
    "fluorescence microscope images of vesicles are also shown for different compositions . in these images ,",
    "the white regions are rich in diphypc , while the dark ones are rich in dppc and cholesterol .",
    "the open circles in the ternary phase diagram correspond to one - phase region ( homogeneous phase ) , the filled circles to the two - phase coexisting region between the l@xmath0-phase and the l@xmath1-phase , and the gray squares indicate the gel phase .",
    "interestingly , the two - phase coexistence region forms a closed loop at the higher temperature ( 43@xmath3c ) . at the lower temperature ( 16@xmath3c ) , two - phase coexistence region can be seen between the l@xmath1-phase and the gel phase , below the triangular coexistence region of the three phases .",
    "there have been several theoretical attempts to predict and reproduce the phase behavior of multi - component lipid membranes .",
    "the membrane structural phase transition is generally first order , and is analogous to the nematic - isotropic transition in liquid crystals .",
    "hence , the structural phase - transition of each type of lipid can be described by the landau  de gennes free - energy  @xcite . a model for biomembranes consisting of two types of lipids having different structural phase - transition temperature",
    "was proposed by komura _",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the phase - transition temperature of the binary lipid membrane was assumed to be a linear interpolation between the transition temperatures of the two pure components , and the model has been successful in explaining general phase behavior of various combinations of binary lipid mixtures .    as for lipid and cholesterol binary mixtures , by focusing on the dual effects of cholesterol as mentioned above , ipsen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a microscopic model , while komura _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite developed a phenomenological model .",
    "it should be noted , however , that role of cholesterol is not yet fully understood .",

    "in addition , a parameter @xmath8 is associated with the saturated lipids and characterizes the degree of orientational order of their hydrocarbon chains ; the larger the value of @xmath8 , the more orientational order of the hydrocarbon chains is not a rigorous order parameter , its absolute value does not have any physical meaning . ] .",
    "the free - energy density @xmath9 of the liquid phase was given by  @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath12 the temperature , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 are all positive interaction parameters .",
    "the @xmath13 term represents the interaction between two saturated lipids and depends on the orientational order @xmath8 . in a similar way",
    ", the @xmath14 and @xmath15 terms correspond to unsaturated - saturated lipids and cholesterol - saturated lipid interactions , respectively .",
    "the last three terms account for the ideal entropy of mixing .",
    "the @xmath14 term indicates that the effective repulsive interaction between unsaturated and saturated lipids becomes stronger when the orientational order @xmath8 increases .",
    "on the other hand , the negative term , proportional to @xmath16 , expresses the tendency of cholesterol to increase the chain order @xmath8 of saturated lipids .",
    "since the total repulsive interaction between unsaturated and saturated lipids is more enhanced according to this combined effect of cholesterol , the two lipids tend to segregate when cholesterol is present .",

    "[ fig : ternaryphase ] ( bottom ) .      in biomembranes of living cells , the two monolayers ( leaflets ) have in general different composition , with a unique asymmetry between the inner and outer leaflets  @xcite .",
    "this asymmetry is essential to the biological function of the cell and is maintained by active processes such as lipid _ `` flip - flop''_. furthermore , the two leaflets are not independent , but rather interact strongly with each other due to various physical and chemical mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting consequences is that a phase separation occurring in one leaflet can affect the other leaflet in a complex way . using the montal ",
    "mller technique , collins _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite addressed the leaflet asymmetry within an artificially constructed bilayer , which biomimics the _ in - vivo _ situation .",
    "two lipid monolayers have been combined , after each of them being individually prepared as a langmuir monolayer with its own lipid composition , and the phase behavior was investigated for such coupled asymmetric monolayers .",
    "when one monolayer having a composition that does not exhibit phase separation was coupled with a second monolayer that was in its two - phase coexistence state , a phase separation was induced in the former monolayer .",
    "in addition , the experiment has shown strong positional correlation and domain registration between domains across the two membrane leaflets .    inspired by the above experiment , a few phenomenological models have been proposed  @xcite to describe the phase separation in such coupled leaflets .",
    "several suggestions have been made about the possible physical origin of leaflet coupling , and they include van der waals interactions , electrostatic interactions , or mutual interdigitation of hydrocarbon chains  @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional lipid bilayers can take various conformations in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) embedded space .",
    "the observation that even vesicles consisting of a single component lipid exhibit a variety of complex shapes has been known for a long time .",
    "the most well - known model that describes the shapes of lipid membranes or vesicles is the _ `` spontaneous curvature model '' _ pioneered by helfrich in the early 1970 s  @xcite . according to helfrich model ,",
    "a membrane is represented as a 2d curved surface of zero thickness , and its shape is governed by the following curvature elasticity free - energy @xmath17 in the above equation , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the two principle curvatures of the membrane surface related to the mean and gaussian curvatures , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , and the integration is performed over the entire surface area @xmath22 of the membrane .",

    "what happens to the membrane shape when the lateral phase separation takes place in a multi - component lipid bilayer ?",
    "the line tension acting at the edge of the 2d domains due to the phase separation plays here an important role .",
    "prior to any experimental works , lipowsky  @xcite proposed the idea of domain - induced budding in multi - component membranes , to be reviewed next .",
    "let s us consider a single 2d circular domain of radius @xmath27 embedded in a flat 2d membrane , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bud ] .",
    "the domain is characterized by a line tension @xmath28 that acts at the 1d edge ( perimeter ) of the domain .",
    "budding of the domain is a process where the domain protrudes in the third dimension ( perpendicular to the membrane plane ) . for simplicity , we assume that the budded domain shape is a spherical section of a sphere of radius @xmath29 .",
    "the total energy of the budded domain is given by the sum of the curvature elasticity energy , eq .",

    "this situation for which the curvature elasticity energy and the line energy balances each other is called _",

    "we show the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : baumgart ] ( left ) , for vesicles composed of dopc / sm/ cholesterol .",
    "these results demonstrate that each domain is characterized by a distinct curvature , and multi - domain vesicles form spontaneously complex structures .",
    "the analysis of these vesicle shapes showed that the observed morphology can be explained in terms of the model of jlicher and lipowsky  @xcite , although some of the experimental reported shapes are probably only metastable .",
    "moreover , baumgart _ et al . _",
    "@xcite sometimes found vesicles that do not undergo macroscopic phase separation , but rather form 2d ordered patterns of finite - size domains as is reproduced in fig .",

    "such patterns are an indication of the so - called _ micro - phase separation _  a well - studied phenomena characterizing equilibrium structures of block copolymers and surfactant solutions  @xcite .",
    "although it still remains unclear under what conditions micro - phase separation can be obtained in bilayers , some recent studies  @xcite have reported that micro - phase separation can be induced by controlling the composition of membranes composed of four - component lipid mixtures .",
    "the appearance of such micro - phase separated structures in membranes or vesicles has been explained in terms of the curvature instability mechanism  @xcite .",
    "several possible physical mechanisms , including the curvature instability that leads to micro - phase separations will be addressed separately in sec .  [",

    "yanagisawa _ et al . _",
    "@xcite found that when salt was added to multi - component vesicles in order to control the osmotic pressure difference , complex shape transformations took place followed by domain budding .",
    "furthermore , multi - component membranes containing charged lipids have been also studied experimentally  @xcite . in general ,",
    "phase separation is suppressed because it is energetically unfavorable to form charged domains  @xcite .",
    "so far , we have regarded the equilibrium properties of multi - component membranes and vesicles .",
    "we proceed by reviewing the hydrodynamic properties of fluid membranes and discuss , in particular , the dynamics of their heterogeneities . in their pioneering work ,",
    "saffman and delbrck considered a hydrodynamic model for biomembranes based on the fluid mosaic model  @xcite .",
    "their main purpose was to obtain the diffusion coefficient of a protein molecule embedded inside a fluid membrane . since the lateral extent of the membrane surface is typically much larger than its thickness , it is justified to regard the membrane as a 2d fluid of zero thickness .",
    "however , if one employs the stokes approximation in order to analyze the stationary motion of an isolated object embedded in an infinitely extended 2d fluid , we are faced with the so - called stokes paradox  @xcite , where the hydrodynamic equation does not have a solution .",
    "the stokes paradox originates from the inability to conserve momentum within a 2d fluid .    on the other hand , because a fluid membrane is not an isolated 2d system but surrounded by a 3d solvent ( water ) , the stokes paradox can be avoided if the dissipation of the membrane momentum is included into the surrounding 3d solvent .",
    "the obtained diffusion coefficient is given below by eq .",

    "in this article , we reviewed some of the more recent physical and chemical - physics studies concerning the static and dynamic properties of lateral phase - separation in multi - component lipid bilayers .",
    "we intentionally avoided including other studies based on biological perspectives as we preferred to keep this review focused on physical concepts and their impact on the understanding of biomembranes .",
    "we have shown that even for the simplified case of lipid membranes composed of only three components , the inhomogeneity in the lateral composition couples with the membrane shape , and can lead to a rich variety of interesting phenomena .",
    "we believe that purely physical phenomena such as phase separation and diffusion that occur in biomembranes may play an important role in biological systems .",
    "since these physical phenomena can be described using appropriate and well - defined physical models , more quantitative arguments are possible regarding the static and dynamic features of lipid domains and , presumingly , with an impact on rafts .",
    "it will be of interest to explore in the future the phase separation in multi - component lipid membranes in presence of glycolipids and membrane proteins , because the latter are abundant in biomembranes  @xcite .",
    "understanding the interactions between protein molecules embedded inside multi - component membranes  @xcite , as well as between different multi - component membranes would be also of interest for future investigations  @xcite .",
