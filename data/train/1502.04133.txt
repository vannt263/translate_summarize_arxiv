    "our findings agree with their conclusions , and indeed our model a only poorly approximates the observed mdf . while our model b ( which includes gas infall ) is able to match the main characteristics of the observed mdf , as shown by fig .",
    "[ fig : gas ] , it can not explain the absence of gas displayed at the present time by umi - which is also a common feature of all the dsph galaxies around the milky way .",
    "the implementation of a galactic wind in model c , albeit in a simplified manner , solves this problem .",
    "we note that it also improves the match of the theoretical mdf with the observed one by slightly extending the tail of the distribution at high metallicity .",
    "we emphasize that the mdf and the sf law are the only observational constraints that were used in setting the constants in eqs .",
    "[ eq : sfr],[eq : infall ] and [ eq : wind ] .",
    "it is then noteworthy that the ensueing chemical evolution model , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : alpha]-[fig : ybamodel ] are successful in matching the observed abundance ratios , even though they were not used in fitting the model parameters .                  the measured @xmath3-element abundances ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : alpha ] ) are generally consistent with a sf efficiency that is lower than that of the galactic halo , as also shown by our models which show a gradual decrease in the [ @xmath4fe ] caused by the onset of snia already at very low metallicities ( in the models at [ fe / h]@xmath15 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the data for both [ mg / fe ] and [ ca / fe ] indicate a plateau at [ fe / h]@xmath16  dex though sparsely sampled , which is not found in the models . for the rest of the individual elements , our [ ca / fe ] and [ ti / fe ] abundances , which are closer to @xcite and @xcite data at higher [ x / fe ] values than the @xcite data , are only slightly lower than the halo abundances .",
    "the [ si / fe ] ratio has a larger scatter in umi than in the halo ( where it is nearly constant ) , and the [ o / fe ] ratio which is reproduced well by our models ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : o ] ) is lower in umi than in the halo stars  @xcite .",
    "however , additional lower metallicity stars are needed in order to better distinguish among the different models .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] , model a ( without infall and winds ) , tends to have a less pronounced decrease at higher [ fe / h ] which is due to the relatively higher sf compared to models b and c. concerning these two models , the only difference is that model c ( with winds ) is able to produce stars at a higher metallicity .",
    "this reflects the mdf we obtain for it , driven by the late metal pollution ( mostly sn  ia ) in a decreasing reservoir of gas which produces a higher concentration of metals . on the other hand ,",
    "we underline that while the winds do not change significantly the chemical evolution for this galaxy , they help explain the absence of gas at the present time and improve the match with the mdf .",
    "instead of evoking an episodic star formation , our models use an extended , low - efficiency star formation period .                              as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ironpeak ] , our models generally reproduce the abundances of the fe - peak elements well . similarly to the @xcite data , our stars have abundances close to those found in halo giants  @xcite in ni and cr ( slightly higher in zn ) , and are higher compared to those from @xcite .",
    "the [ cr / fe ] abundance at nearly the solar value in umi446 , umi718 , umi k from @xcite as well as the two more metal rich @xcite stars shows a plateau for this element apart from the decline towards lower metallicities which is likely to be caused by nlte conditions as argued by @xcite .",
    "the cu abundances we measure in umi718 and umi396 are in agreement with the whole umi sample available to date , which show a decline with increasing metallicity .    for mn",
    ", we match the bulk of the data at intermediate metallicity , so the model is relatively successful , however the decrease predicted at the extremely low metallicities by our models is not consistent with the data in which this signature is detected at [ fe / h]=-3  dex .",
    "our most metal poor star , umi446 , deviates from rest of the data set with a strong enhancement in fe - peak elements , particularly in sc and mn .",
    "although stars measured by @xcite display [ mn / fe]@xmath170 as well , umi446 has a much lower [ fe / h ] than these two , and can not be explained by our chemical evolution model even if we take into account metal - dependent mn yields for both sne ia and sn ii as used by @xcite and @xcite .    as a final remark in this subsection",
    ", we find the chemistry shown by the most metal rich star measured by @xcite challenging .",
    "an anomalous pollution by sn  ia which can not be simulated by our simple chemical evolution models , could explain the measured drop in the ratio of @xmath3-elements ( and neutron capture elements ) .",
    "however , it is more difficult to explain the strong enrichment of fe in this star without an enrichment of the other fe - peak elements .",
    ".,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    there are several interesting points that are seen in the neutron capture element abundances in umi .",
    "first , all of the neutron capture elements that we measure have very large scatter across the observed stars , covering a range of about 2  dex .",
    "the y and ba abundances for the data set are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : neutron ] and the [ ce / fe ] and [ nd / fe ] abundances in two new stars each are given in table  [ tab : ab ] .",
    "due to this spread in the observed abundances , we expect that inhomogeneous modeling would be required to obtain a more precise match to the data ( see for example cescutti 2008 , cescutti et al .",
    "2013 and cescutti and chiappini 2014 ) .",
    "nevertheless , a simple chemical evolution model should be able to reproduce the mean trend .",
    "the second point of note is the increase of [ ba / fe ] with metallicity seen in the entire umi sample ( fig .",
    "[ fig : neutron ] ) and which overlaps with the halo stars  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : neutron ] , we show that the model results for y and ba are in reasonable agreement with the data in that there is a systematically lower average [ ba / fe ] ratio at [ fe / h]@xmath183  dex compared to higher metallicities . in addition , although the present data in umi can not resolve these details , the models predict a dip in both the [ y / fe ] and [ ba / fe ] abundance ratios at [ fe / h]@xmath19 , which is due to the timescale at which the r - process production by electron capture sn ( see @xcite for details ) starts .",
    "finally , as predicted by the theoretical nucleosynthesis prescriptions we use , the data show a much lower [ ba / fe ] ratio at very low metallicity , where the [ y / fe ] remains approximately at the same level . at lower metallicity",
    ", the production of these neutron capture elements could be sustained by s - process production in fast rotating stars .",
    "note that the low [ ba / fe ] abundance ratio is also found in the hercules dsph over a broad range in [ fe / h ]  @xcite this effect is clearer when we plot the ratio between these two neutron capture elements ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ybamodel ] ) . in this model ,",
    "before the r - process production starts at [ fe / h]@xmath203 , the ism is enriched only through s - process production in spinstars , which is confirmed by an overabundance in [ y / ba ] found in the data at very low metallicities .",
    "there is possibly an offset of @xmath210.5  dex between the last data with high [ y / ba ] defined by umi446 from this work and cos4 from  @xcite and the knee found in the model ; this can be explained both in terms of inhomogeneity of the system and also in tiny variations in the parameters of the chemical evolution model , definitely inside the uncertainties of our modelling .",
    "in this paper , we presented a new data set of chemical abundances for the ursa minor ( umi ) dsph , based on spectra taken with the keck hires spectrograph , as well as a new set of chemical evolution models for 12 elements .",
    "a data set combining our new measurements with data from previous studies is consistent with a scenario in which the very metal poor stars in the dsphs have @xmath3-element abundances generally comparable to those in the galactic halo , although in umi , there is a gradual decrease in the @xmath3 elements with increasing metallicity which indicates that the ism was also enriched by sn  ia .",
    "the halo stars do not show this trend which is a signature that the star formation in the halo stopped on a shorter timescale compared to the timescale for the enrichment by sn  ia .",
    "our chemical evolution models use similar nucleoynthesis prescriptions to those by @xcite for modeling umi with the smaller data set available at the time . however , our implementation of the star formation rate is different as we derive the sfh exclusively from the cmd , as done by @xcite for computing the manganese abundances in four other dsphs . here , we extended these latter models to study ursa minor for the first time and to include the other elements for which we have measured abundances .",
    "the most striking novelty in the models is the nucleosynthesis adopted for the neutron capture elements ; due to the lack of data , the signature of increasing [ y / ba ] ratio toward lower metallicities was not studied in these previous works .",
    "the overabundance of [ y / ba ] at very low metallicity , similar to that found in the galactic halo , is reproduced by nucleosynthesis in the spinstars as argued in @xcite and is modeled for the first time for a dsph .",
    "this trend is due to the timescale of the onset of r - process production by electron capture in sn  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; before this point the production of the neutron capture elements could be sustained by s - process production in fast rotating stars @xcite .    in the ratio of the [ @xmath3/fe ] abundances , it is not easy to identify the trends in the data , ie .",
    "whether these elements show plateaux at low metallicities up to around [ fe / h]@xmath222  dex , or whether they are matched better by a gradual decrease of [ @xmath3/fe ] starting from very low metallicities as found in our models . in either scenario , together with subsolar values of [ ba / fe ] up to the same metallicity where it reaches the solar value , the abundances are consistent with a sf process that lasted a relatively long time ( @xmath23 5 gyrs ) but had a very low efficiency until it stopped at [ fe@xmath1h]@xmath24 - 1.3  dex .",
    "while earlier studies found that an inefficient sf in a system without infall or mass loss seemed to fit the data  @xcite , as the spectroscopic samples grew , already @xcite were able to show that to obtain the mdf , a model with the infall of gas was required .",
    "our best model is one where a gas loss proportional to the amount of total gas was also included ( winds ) , and could account for both the low efficiency of the sf at later stages and the observed lack of gas today .",
    "we emphasize that , realistically , the gas loss from the dsph is due to a combination of supernova feedback , winds and tidal interactions and hence would have a more drastic effect .",
    "our results are consistent with the previous data except for a deviation of the abundances of the fe - peak elements for umi446 which is our most metal poor star .",
    "the [ fe / h ] of this star is very similar to cos4 from @xcite which has [ fe / h]@xmath222.7 dex .",
    "although abundances of the low z @xmath3-elements are consistent with the rest of the sample , umi446 has an unexpectedly higher abundance of sc and the @xmath3-elements ti and the fe - peak elements cr , mn , ni , cu , zn .",
    "at z=30 it becomes consistent again with the rest of the data , which is especially important in the relation of the [ y / ba ] ratio with metallicity . among these ,",
    "one of the most challenging features is the overabundance of mn for umi446 .",
    "these intriguing results could point to an inhomogeneous chemical enrichment of the ism at the early stages .",
    "although this inhomogeneity would be short lived , it might be able to produce a star like umi446 if the explosive nucleosynthesis of a sn ii through a very massive progenitor with bipolar explosion ( jet - like ) is taken into account , as suggested by  @xcite .    in the future",
