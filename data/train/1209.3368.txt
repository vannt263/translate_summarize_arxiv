    "in contrast to the fermi arcs on @xmath0he - a surface@xcite the fermi arcs on the domain wall in @xmath0he - a and on the ab interface can not be obtained in the framework of quasiclassical approximation .",
    "indeed the quasiclassical approximation when applied to these systems yields that any of the subgap spectral branches given by eq.([eq : nakahara ] ) intersects the fermi level@xcite .",
    "thus the number of zero energy modes in quasiclassics is model depended and does not satisfy the index theorem .",
    "the reason behind this discrepancy is that the zero modes exist for @xmath181 ( see dashed lines in fig.[fig : orbit]b ) which corresponds to the quasiclassical trajectories almost parallel to the plane of domain wall when one needs to get into account the normal reflection of qasiparticles from the order parameter inhomogeneity along the @xmath149 axis . since the normal reflection is inherently missing in quasiclassical andreev equations ( without diagonal potential )",
    "this approximation fails to describe zero modes and fermi arcs on the domain wall in @xmath0he - a and the ab interface .",
    "the modification of quasiclassical results due to the normal reflection can be analyzed by employing the semiclassical approximation ( see section [ subsubsec : semiclassical ] ) which yields three possible types of closed orbits in @xmath97 phase space . in case",
    "when quasiclassical approximation is valid the regime * ( ii ) * of only andreev reflection is realized with two separate orbits at @xmath222 and @xmath223 shown by the green solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbit]a .",
    "the bohr - sommerfeld quantization ( [ eq : bs ] ) yields the same energy of bound states for the two orbits which is degenerate by @xmath141 and coincides well with quasiclassical result for @xmath172 .",
    "however for smaller @xmath224 two andreev orbits merge into a single one shown in fig.[fig : orbit]a by blue dash - dotted line .",
    "this orbit has both andreev and normal reflection points and therefore is not described by the quasiclassical approximation .",
    "moreover merging of andreev orbits doubles the orbit area .",
    "therefore the number of subgap states according to bohr - sommerfeld quantization is doubled which is manifested by the appearance of the second semiclassical branch in fig.[fig : orbit]b simultaneously with merging of two andreev orbits in fig.[fig : orbit]a . in exact spectrum obtained by solving numerically the bdg system the branch doubling is manifested in splitting of quasiclassical branches in figs.[fig : emux],[fig : epy ] .",
    "thus the branch splitting is the direct result of normal reflection of quasiparticles moving almost parallel to the domain wall .    affected by the enhanced normal reflection",
    "the behaviour of the energy branches changes in @xmath182 limit qualitatively compared to the quasiclassical result . at fixed value of momentum projection @xmath20 ( and",
    "spin projection @xmath188 in case of a phase domain wall ) there is only one branch left which intersects the fermi level and supports majorana states in accordance with the topological index theorem . the rest of spectral branches become non - monotonic at small values of @xmath225 at @xmath226 and turn upwards at @xmath129 as can be seen in the fig.[fig : emux ] .",
    "we demonstrated that fermi arcs on the domain wall in the a - phase and at the interface between the a - phase and the b - phase of superfluid @xmath0he obey the index theorem , which connects topological properties of bulk states on two sides of the walls with topology of zero energy bound states .",
    "in contrast to the other systems supporting fermi arcs the bulk - edge correspondence here can be established only beyond the quasiclassical approximation by solving the exact bdg system numerically .",
    "the domain wall in a - phase contains 4 fermi arcs , if one takes into account spin degrees of freedom , while the ab interface contains 2 fermi arcs , i.e. the same number as the surface of the a - phase .",
    "the reason for this difference is that the fermi arc is determined by the weyl points in the bulk states on two sides of the wall .",
    "the @xmath0he - b , though being a topological superfluid , does not contain weyl points and thus does not contribute to the number of the fermi arcs .",
    "note that the spectrum of localized fermions at the domain wall of the a phase is identical to the spectrum of electronic states bound at the domain wall in @xmath35 superconductor @xmath36 .",
    "majorana fermions living on the fermi arc at the ab interface may give an additional contribution to the calculated friction force acting on the moving interface @xcite at very low temperatures .",
    "this is important for the development of the kelvin - helmholtz instability of the moving ab interface observed in ref .",
    "( see also chapter 27 of ref . ) .",
    "the latter instability has an analogue with the ergoregion instability of black holes discussed in chapter 32 of ref . .",
    "we considered the simplest most symmetric realizations of the a - a and a - b interfaces .",
    "the problem for future investigations is weather the fermi arc survives or not , if the symmetry of the interface is violated . for",
