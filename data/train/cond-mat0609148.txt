    "trions ( also called charged excitons ) are bound states of a neutral exciton ( electron  hole pair , @xmath0 ) with an additional carrier , either electron or valence hole , for a negative ( @xmath1 ) or positive trion ( @xmath2 ) , respectively.@xcite neutral and charged excitons occur naturally in photoluminescence ( pl ) experiments , in which creation or annihilation of @xmath3@xmath4 pairs accompanies interband absorption or emission of light .",
    "@xcite while excitons are expected in charge - neutral systems , formation of trions depends on the presence of free carriers .",
    "the trion binding energy @xmath5 is defined as the effective attraction between an exciton and an additional carrier ( @xmath6+e[e]-e[x^\\pm]$ ] , where @xmath7 $ ] is the ground energy of a given complex ) .",
    "an important material parameter affecting @xmath5 is the ratio of electron and hole effective masses,@xcite @xmath8 ; for @xmath9 the @xmath10 dynamics reduces to a familiar problem of the @xmath11 center.@xcite originating from charge - dipole interaction , trion binding is usually much weaker than the exciton binding .",
    "however , its strong enhancement by spatial confinement and/or magnetic field @xmath12 was predicted.@xcite the pioneering experiment of kheng _",
    "et al._@xcite in cdte , followed by a series of measurements in gaas @xcite and znse @xcite confirmed that it is sufficient for the trion s detection .",
    "the @xmath13 was also observed@xcite and shown to be different from @xmath10 ( due to the @xmath14 asymmetry ) .    in a typical experimental configuration ,",
    "a quantum well containing a quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron ( or hole ) gas is placed in the perpendicular field .",
    "the field should be sufficiently strong to induce magnetic quantization of single - particle states into macroscopically degenerate landau levels ( lls ) , with the inter - ll ( cyclotron ) spacing @xmath15 which is at least comparable to the effective excitonic rydberg ( @xmath16  mev in gaas ) .",
    "the well width @xmath17 should not be much greater than the effective excitonic bohr radius ( @xmath18  nm in gaas ) and the magnetic length ( @xmath19  nm at @xmath20  t ) .",
    "the quantum - mechanical problem of a 2d exciton in a high magnetic field goes back several decades.@xcite the continuous ( owing to the neutral charge ) energy dispersion in some idealized situations is known analytically , and the deviations due to inter - ll mixing or finite well width have been studied experimentally and numerically.@xcite the simple @xmath21 optical selection rule ( @xmath22 being the wavevector of an annihilated @xmath3@xmath4 pair ) results from the small momentum carried by the absorbed / emitted photon . in experiment ,",
    "the excitonic recombination is usually observed in pl of quantum wells containing no free carriers .",
    "2d trions at high @xmath12 have also been extensively studied in the past.@xcite different theoretical / computational approaches and the key results have been discussed in an exhaustive review by peeters , riva , and varga.@xcite depending on the parameters ( e.g. , @xmath17 and @xmath12 ) , the trion energy spectrum contains one or more bound states , which can be conveniently labeled by total spin @xmath23 of the pair of electrons and total angular momentum @xmath24 . at small @xmath12",
    ", the only bound @xmath10 state is the spin - singlet with @xmath25 and @xmath26 , equivalent to a 2d hydrogen ion .",
    "@xcite in the ( unrealistic ) limit of very high @xmath12 and vanishing @xmath17 , the singlet unbinds , and it is replaced by the spin - triplet with @xmath27 and @xmath28.@xcite a triplet trion was identified by shields _ et al . _ @xcite ( although now it is not clear if it was the @xmath28 triplet ground state ) .",
    "the singlet  triplet crossover was predicted@xcite in rather high fields ( e.g.  @xmath29  t in narrow symmetric gaas wells ) . despite initial difficulties@xcite it was",
    "also eventually confirmed in several experiments .",
    "@xcite additional bound states were predicted@xcite at intermediate @xmath12 , but ( for realistic parameters ) they are always less strongly bound than the above two .",
    "these states were also confirmed by both independent calculations @xcite and by experiments . @xcite    the pair of optical selection rules results from invariance under ( magnetic ) translations@xcite and from the particle  hole symmetry between conduction electrons and valence holes.@xcite both these `` geometric '' and `` hidden '' symmetries are at least weakly broken in realistic conditions .",
    "nevertheless , recombination of trions with @xmath30 requires a symmetry - breaking collision ( with an impurity or another carrier ) , and therefore , it became customary to label different trions as `` bright '' and `` dark '' ( meaning having @xmath26 and @xmath30 , respectively ) .",
    "in most recent experiments,@xcite up to three trion states are observed : `` bright '' singlet @xmath31 , `` dark '' triplet @xmath32 , and a weakly bound `` bright '' triplet @xmath33 with @xmath27 and @xmath26 .",
    "vanishing oscillator strength,@xcite of @xmath32 confirmed directly in optical absorption , @xcite makes it more difficult to observe ( even in pl ) than the other trions .",
    "in fact , this state had not been conclusively identified until the work of yusa _",
    "et al._,@xcite motivated by earlier high - field experiments ( especially of hayne _ et al .",
    "_ , @xcite showing apparent discrepancy with prediction @xcite of singlet ",
    "triplet crossing , but also several others@xcite showing inconsistent features in trion spectra ) and a numerical prediction@xcite of an excited triplet state , @xmath33 .",
    "most recently , additional weakly bound states were reported @xcite in cdte ( @xmath34  mev , about twice larger than in gaas ) .    involving only three particles , trion s",
    "quantum dynamics might appear to be relatively simple , both conceptually and computationally .",
    "addition of high magnetic field and confinement does not add much complexity , and indeed , quantum numbers and symmetries of all bound trions ( in wide range of realistic conditions ) are by now understood . in short ,",
    "the dynamics depends on competition of several energy scales , with the following characteristic values for our example of a 15  nm symmetric gaas well at @xmath20  t : cyclotron gap ( @xmath35  mev for electrons and @xmath36  mev for heavy holes ) , coulomb energy ( @xmath37  mev ) , and a small zeeman gap .",
    "the well width @xmath17 comes in two places , defining excitation gaps to higher subbands ( gap to the second subband is @xmath38  mev for electrons and @xmath39  mev for the holes ) and affecting in - plane coulomb matrix elements ( this effect is parametrized by @xmath40 ) .",
    "also , even weak asymmetry between electron and hole subband wavefunctions @xmath41 can considerably affect the trion binding , since it leads to different magnitudes of @xmath3@xmath3 and @xmath3@xmath4 interactions , which no longer cancel in @xmath5 ( this effect is essential in asymmetric wells , not considered here , where the asymmetry depends on carrier concentration and/or additional gates )",
    ".    however , the above optimistic ( and popular ) view hides the fact that good understanding of the role of trions in pl experiments must include variety of complications due to coupling to the environment ( e.g. , complex single - particle energy band structure with nonparabolic and anisotropic dispersions , interaction with free carriers , lattice defects , and phonons , spin - orbit effects , etc . ) .",
    "some quantities ( e.g. , the binding energies , especially of the triplet states ) can be calculated rather accurately.@xcite however , others ( such as the critical values of @xmath12 and @xmath17 for the singlet  triplet transitions ) depend so sensitively on the ( often unknown ) parameters that their quantitative modeling turns out somewhat pointless .",
    "another unsolved ( quantitatively ) and important problem is the kinetics of trions,@xcite involving their binding / unbinding ( @xmath42 ) and , at high @xmath12 , orbital / spin relaxation ( @xmath43 ) .    in this article",
    ", we analyze the effect of trions on the optical absorption spectrum of 2d electrons in a magnetic field .",
    "thus , in addition to the earlier studied bound trion states , @xcite the entire low - energy @xmath44 spectrum is considered . in a somewhat related work ,",
    "asymmetry of trion absorption peaks at small @xmath12 was discussed by stebe _",
    "et al._@xcite the inclusion of only two electrons and one hole in the model restricts it to the `` dilute '' regime , defined by a small value of the filling factor , @xmath45 ( @xmath46 is defined as the number of electrons @xmath47 divided by the ll degeneracy @xmath48 ; alternatively , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the 2d electron concentration ) .",
    "it is remarkable that in some systems the immersed trion is only weakly ( perturbatively ) affected by the surrounding electrons . in narrow wells and in high magnetic fields , this occurs at @xmath51 due to `` laughlin correlations''@xcite between electrons and trions,@xcite preventing strong @xmath3@xmath10 collisions ( indeed , in wider wells trions seem to be strongly coupled to the electrons and can not be regarded as simple three - body quasiparticles@xcite ) .",
    "the density of states ( dos ) and absorption spectra are calculated numerically by exact diagonalization in haldane s spherical geometry .",
    "@xcite the figures were drawn for a particular choice of a symmetric @xmath52  nm gaas quantum well at @xmath20  t. since absorption into bound trion states was studied earlier , we concentrate on the effects of the interaction of the exciton with a ( single ) _ unbound _ electron .",
    "the main conclusions are redistribution of the density of states ( by filling the gaps between the lls ) and the emergence of additional , trion peaks in the absorption spectrum ( also in the excited lls ) .",
    "the calculation is supplemented with the results of experimental polarization - resolved photoluminescence ( pl ) and photoluminescence - excitation ( ple ) studies of a 2d hole and electron gases in a symmetric 15  nm gaas well . presented spectra",
    "reveal absorption into a pair of bright trions in the lowest ll and emission from these two states , the exciton , and the dark triplet trion .",
    "the @xmath53 and @xmath44 energy spectra are calculated by exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix on a haldane sphere , convenient for modeling an infinite plane with 2d translational invariance . in this geometry ,",
    "the magnetic field normal to the spherical surface of radius @xmath54 is produced by a dirac monopole od strength @xmath55",
    "( @xmath56 is the magnetic flux quantum ) . through the following relation , @xmath57",
    ", monopole strength determines surface curvature ( in the magnetic units ) .",
    "the single - particle states are called monopole harmonics.@xcite they are the eigenstates of angular momentum @xmath58 and its projection @xmath59 on the @xmath60-axis .",
    "the lowest shell , corresponding to the lowest ll , has @xmath61 and finite degeneracy @xmath62 .",
    "higher shells , corresponding to the excited lls labeled by index @xmath63 , have @xmath64 .",
    "the energy of the @xmath63th shell is @xmath65 .",
    "it contains the cyclotron gap ( with @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the effective mass ) and an additional , curvature - dependent term . in order to model a real structure ,",
    "we take advantage of the ll structure of monopole harmonics , but replace @xmath68 with the correct energies of electron and hole lls .",
    "e.g. , at @xmath20  t , we use @xmath69  mev for electrons and 3.7  mev for the heavy hole ( the latter value taken after cole _",
    "@xcite for @xmath52  nm ) .",
    "the second - quantization hamiltonian reads @xmath70 an additional term @xmath71 will also be included to describe interaction with a positive or negative point charge . here ,",
    "@xmath72 and @xmath73 are operators creating and annihilating a conduction electron or a valence hole , in the state labeled by a composite index @xmath74 containing all relevant single - particle quantum numbers ( band @xmath75 , subband @xmath76 , ll index @xmath63 , angular momentum @xmath59 , and spin @xmath77 ) .",
    "the coulomb interaction matrix elements @xmath78 and @xmath79 in the basis of monopole harmonics are known analytically for all particles confined to a 2d surface of the sphere .",
    "however , to account for a finite width of the real quantum well , we have integrated all matrix elements numerically , in 3d , using form - factors appropriate for the actual electron and hole subband wavefunctions @xmath41 .",
    "mixing with higher quantum well subbands ( excited states in the @xmath60-direction , labeled by @xmath80 ) is not very strong in a narrow and symmetric well due to high quantization energy ( for @xmath52  nm and al@xmath81ga@xmath82as barriers , it is 49.1  mev and 11.5  mev to the first excited electron and hole subbands , respectively ; calculation after ref .  ) and the parity conservation . nevertheless , it is not quite negligible for the bound states ( states with strong interactions ) .    without impurities ,",

    "also , dos within the inter - ll regions shows features related to the interactions in a nontrivial manner .",
    "for example , spin dependence of structures at @xmath124  mev and @xmath125  mev reveals their connection with the ( obviously , spin - sensitive ) exciton  electron interaction . note that the @xmath53 peak at @xmath116  mev , identified earlier with an inter - ll exciton , persists in the @xmath44 curves regardless of spin configuration ( to confirm its _",
