    "before the discovery of extrasolar planets , explaining the formation of terrestrial planets in our solar system was already a challenging task . the detection of a large variety of planetary systems containing earth  mass or super  earth planets by the _ kepler",
    "_ satellite has made the task even more arduous .",
    "terrestrial mass planets are usually considered to form either _ in situ _ or through inward migration . _ in situ _ formation was the early scenario proposed for forming planets in our solar system ( wetherill 1988 , lissauer 1993 and references therein ) , and has been put forward as a way to explain the _ kepler _ candidates ( hansen & murray 2013 ) . however , it has been argued that this model is not consistent with the distribution of solids in discs ( raymond & cossou  2014 , schlichting  2014 ) .",
    "also , _ in situ _ formation models have difficulties forming cores of giant planets before the gas dissipates ( thommes et al .",
    "2003 , chambers 2016 ) .",
    "formation through inward migration is an efficient way of obtaining tight systems of super  earths with short periods ( terquem & papaloizou 2007 , haghighipour 2013 and references therein ) , but fails to explain terrestrial planets similar to those in our solar system .",
    "however , migration of planets in dissipating discs has recently been studied ( coleman & nelson 2014 , cossou et al .",
    "2014 , coleman & nelson 2016 ) and seems to offer a way of combining the advantages of both models for forming terrestrial planets .",
    "coleman & nelson ( 2014 , 2016 ) studied the evolution of systems containing initially 36 or 52 cores with masses of @xmath1 or @xmath2 , respectively , spread between 1 and 20  au .",
    "in addition , there were thousands of planetesimals with masses 10 , 20 or 50 times smaller than that of the embryos and distributed in between the planets .",
    "the disc had a surface gas density at least equal to that of the minimum solar mass nebula , i.e. @xmath3 and @xmath4 at 1  au , and was subject to photoevaporation and viscous evolution .",
    "they found that terrestrial ",
    "mass planets and super  earths formed in the discs with the lowest masses . in the models with small abundance of solids and large planetesimals , growth was found to be limited so that migration was inefficient .",
    "such models resulted in systems of low mass planets spread out through the disc and in which mean motion resonances were destroyed after the disc dissipated .",
    "cossou et al .",
    "( 2014 ) started with cores with masses between 0.1 and 2  @xmath0 spread between 1 and 20  au .",
    "the total mass in the cores was between 21 and 84  @xmath0 .",
    "they considered a disc with a surface gas density of @xmath5 at 1  au and @xmath6 .",
    "in some of their simulations , the disc s mass was decreased exponentially to mimic disc s viscous evolution and photoevaporation .",
    "systems of hot super  earths in mean motion resonances were produced in discs which were not dissipating , whereas the systems were more spread out and not in resonances when dissipation was included .    in these studies ,",
    "all types of planets formed from the same parent population and , in general , the planetary systems that were produced at around 1  au contained planets more massive than the terrestrial planets in our solar system . in this paper , we consider a model where different parent populations exist at different locations and the disc is photoevaporating .    in typical protoplanetary discs , the type ",
    "i migration timescale becomes comparable to the disc lifetime for cores at least as massive as 0.1 and 1  @xmath0 at 1 and 5  au , respectively .",
    "planet formation models suggest that it takes at least 1  myr for 0.1  @xmath0 cores to form at @xmath7  au .",
    "more massive cores , with a mass @xmath8 , may form on this timescale beyond the snow line , at around 5  au .",
    "this prompts us to consider a model where the initial conditions are a population of 0.1  @xmath0 cores between 1 and 5  au and a population of 1  @xmath0 cores beyond 5  au , which start migrating when the disc is @xmath7  myr  old .",
    "the total mass in these populations of cores is set by the initial surface density in the disc .",
    "we evolve these initial populations in a disc which undergoes a transition due to x  ray photoevaporation .",
    "transition discs are defined as discs lacking emission in the near  infrared , which means that there is a ( large ) hole in the dust distribution in their inner parts .",
    "observations strongly suggest two types of transition discs : those with low mm flux , which have low accretion rates and hole sizes smaller than about 20  au , and those with high mm flux , which have higher accretion rates and hole sizes larger than 20  au ( owen & clarke 2012 , owen 2016 and references therein ) .",
    "it is believed that low mm flux transition discs are in the process of dispersing , whereas high mm flux transition discs are not .",
    "the most commonly accepted interpretation for low mm flux transition discs is x  ray photoevaporation . in this model ,",
    "a gap opens up after about 3  myr ( 75% of the disc lifetime ) at @xmath9  au , where the accretion rate in the disc matches the photoevaporation rate ( owen , ercolano & clarke 2011 ) .",
    "the inner parts of the disc then become decoupled from the outer parts and can not be resupplied in gas and dust .",
    "they subsequently accrete onto the central star whereas the outer edge of the gap recedes due to photoevaporation .",
    "by contrast , it is believed that , in high mm flux transition discs , a massive planet ( with a mass of a few jupiter masses ) is responsible for creating a gap .",
    "the above discussion suggests that , in low mm flux transition discs , 0.1  @xmath0 and 1  @xmath0 cores forming between 1 and 5  au and beyond 5  au , respectively , on a timescale of 1  myr , would start to migrate a million years or so before a gap opens up at around 2  au .",
    "as their migration timescale itself is on the order of a million years , it can be expected that the dispersion of the disc will prevent migration of cores to very small radii and also that the formation of the gap will prevent massive cores to be delivered to the region of terrestrial planets .",
    "this is the model we explore in this paper .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "formation ] , we describe the disc evolution model and justify the parameters that are used in the simulations .",
    "we also give expressions for the planet migration and eccentricity damping timescales and briefly discuss core formation timescales . in section  [ sec : sim ] , we present @xmath10body simulations of cores migrating in photoevaporating discs .",
    "we first describe the numerical scheme and the initial set up .",
    "we then present the results of the simulations .",
    "we show that , for reasonable parameters that are consistent with the observations , a population of @xmath2 cores originating from between 2 and 4  au migrate down to 0.51  au .",
    "the final masses of planets are between a fraction of an earth mass and @xmath11 . as for the population of 1  @xmath0 cores originating from @xmath12  au",
    ", it forms a few cores of a few earth masses which may migrate down below the inner edge of the gap only in the most massive discs considered here . in less massive discs , cores with",
    "a mass comparable to that of jupiter may be left at a few au from the star .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "in this section , we review the different timescales that are used in the simulations .",
    "we adopt an initial surface density profile in the disc :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the initial surface density at 1  au .",
    "this density gradient gives the best fit to the thermal continuum emission from @xmath7  myr old discs in the ophiuchus star ",
    "forming region , as shown by andrews et al .",
    "we express @xmath14 in terms of the disc mass within 50  au , @xmath15 :    @xmath16    in this paper , we focus on the evolution of planetary systems in transition discs which have low mm fluxes and are supposed to be the consequence of x  ray photoevaporation ( owen  2016 and references therein ) . in this model ,",
    "a gap first opens up in the disc at the location where the accretion rate becomes equal to the photoevaporation rate . at this point ,",
    "the parts of the disc within the inner edge of the gap become isolated from the outer parts , and can not be resupplied in gas and dust .",
    "they accrete onto the central star on a timescale of a few @xmath17  years and become depleted . at the same time , the outer edge of the gap moves out because of erosion due to photoevaporation .",
    "the evolution of a disc subject to such a process has been calculated by owen , ercolano & clarke ( 2011 ) . here",
    ", we evolve the surface density profile @xmath18 in such a way as to reproduce their calculation .    we start with @xmath19 given by equation  ( [ sigma ] ) . after a time @xmath20 which is between 1 and 3 myr",

    "when the cores do not migrate significantly , either because the initial disc is not massive enough ( low @xmath14 ) or migration starts late , after the disc s mass has decreased down to low values ( large @xmath108 ) , evolution is very much like what is obtained in _ in situ _ formation models .",
    "there is not enough gas to damp the eccentricities , so collisions occur and a few planets with masses at most between 1 and 2  @xmath0 form without significant inward migration .",
    "so far , we have ignored in the simulations heavier cores that may be delivered to the inner parts from further away in the disc . whether these cores will be present or not depends on wether they can form on a timescale of 1  myr .",
    "let us assume this the case , and there is a population of 1  @xmath0 cores that form within @xmath7  myr beyond the snow line at around 5  au ( see chambers 2016 for models ) . according to equation  ( [ tmig ] )",
    ", the migration timescale of these cores at 5  au would be the same as that of 0.1  @xmath0 cores at 1  au , and therefore we choose the same value of @xmath126  myr as in the simulations with smaller cores presented above ( we also keep @xmath48  myr ) . in figure  ( [ fig4 ] ) , we show the evolution of 10 cores with initial mass of @xmath145 and initially spread between 5 and 6.5  au , for both @xmath146 ( upper plot ) and @xmath147 ( lower plot ) .",
    "as pointed out above , if these cores had formed _ in situ _ they would have used all the dust initially present in the disc at these locations .",
    "alternatively , they could have formed further away and migrated in , although it takes more time to form cores at larger distances from the star . as seen on the figure",
    ", these cores grow through collisions and migrate in while maintaining mmr .",
    "when the gap opens up , in the case where @xmath93 , some of the cores have reached the inner parts of the disc below 2  au while the other cores are in the gap .",
    "the depletion of gas leads to eccentricity growth and further collisions occur , leaving at the end of the simulation two cores with masses of 3 and 6  @xmath0 between 1 and 2  au and one core with a mass of 1  @xmath0 near 3  au . in the case of a less massive disc ,",
    "i.e. @xmath148 , none of the cores reach the gap before it opens up . here , by the end of the simulation , a 1  @xmath0 core has been scattered to large distance ( @xmath149  au ) while two cores with masses of 7 and 2  @xmath0 are left at 4 and @xmath150  au . in that case ,",
    "evolution is very much like what is obtained with _ in situ _ models .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the systems are stable after the last collisions occur and until 6 myr . the eccentricities ,",
    "although large , vary smoothly and in a periodic way . however , further collisions over much longer timescales can not be ruled out .    )",
    "but for @xmath151 , @xmath145 , @xmath152  au , @xmath153  au and @xmath93 ( _ upper plot _ ) or @xmath147 ( _ lower plot _ ) .",
    "collisions between initial cores occur very early in the simulations so the 10 cores are not visible on the plots .",

    "if we now start with both small cores ( @xmath154 ) at around 2  au and heavier cores ( @xmath155 ) at around 5  au , the evolution can be predicted on the basis of the results presented above .",
    "the small cores evolve as described above , and always end up forming planets with masses at most between 1 and 2 @xmath0 at locations that depend on how fast they have migrated , but usually between 0.5 and 2  au .",
    "if the heavier cores are able to catch up , they may sweep some of the smallest ones on their way in and the final system has a few cores of several earth masses below 2  au , mixed with less massive planets . on the other hand , the heavier cores may not be able to migrate below the inner edge of the gap ( e.g. , for low values of @xmath14 or if the heavy cores have large @xmath108 ) , in which case they will also evolve mostly _ in situ _ to form a few massive cores beyond 4  au or so .",
    "this is exactly what we have found in simulations starting with 50 small cores ( @xmath154 ) between 2 and 5  au together with 5 or 10 heavier cores ( @xmath155 ) between 5 and 6.5  au .",

    ", the cores evolve mostly _ in situ _ , and after the disc dissipates there is no core below 1.8  au .    ) but here there are initially 50 cores with @xmath103 between 2 and 5  au and 5 cores with @xmath145 between 5 and 6.5  au .",
    "the numbers above the lines at the end of the simulation indicate the mass of the cores left in @xmath0 . ]",
    "in this paper , we have studied the outcome of core migration in transition discs produced by photoevaporation .",
    "the initial surface mass density in discs at around 1  au is at most on the order @xmath77 , and it decreases with time .",
    "therefore , planetary cores that form at this distance from the star migrate on a timescale smaller than the disc lifetime only if their mass is larger than about 0.1  @xmath0 .",
    "as it takes at least about 1  myr to form such cores at around 1  au , migration of cores forming below the snow line starts to be relevant only when the disc is at least 1  myr old .",
    "similarly , if the surface density varies as @xmath158 , cores at @xmath12  au have a migration timescale shorter than the disc lifetime only when their mass reaches about 1  @xmath0 . assuming these cores form on a timescale of about 1  myr , they will also start to migrate significantly when the disc is about 1  myr old .    in low  mm flux transition discs ,",
    "a gap is believed to open up at around 23  au due to x  ray photoevaporation when the disc is a few myr .",
    "the disc s inner parts are subsequently accreted onto the central star as a result of viscous evolution , while the outer edge of the gap recedes under the effect of photoevaporation . in this context",
    ", we find that @xmath78 cores that form within @xmath7  myr between 14  au end up forming a system of a few planets with masses between a fraction of an earth mass and 1.5  @xmath0 at most .",
    "in general , these cores do not migrate down further than @xmath159  au , and may even evolve _ in situ _ in low mass discs .",
    "they are not in mean motion resonances .",
    "such resonances , which appear during the migration phase , are usually destroyed when the gas dissipates ( as previously found by cossou et al .",
    "2014 and coleman & nelson 2016 ) .",
    "it is difficult to form planets at smaller radii , unless we start with heavier cores or start migrating the cores earlier ( as , e.g. , in terquem & papaloizou  2007 ) . in both cases",
    ", it would require a more efficient planet formation process than envisioned here .",
    "if @xmath7  @xmath0 cores can form beyond the snow line also within @xmath7  myr , they migrate on the same timescale as the smaller cores and , depending on the surface density in the disc , they may or may not reach the inner parts of the disc . after the gap has opened up , the inner parts of the disc become isolated from the outer parts , and no more material is delivered there .    we have found that , in a disc with an initial surface mass density of about @xmath77 at 1  au , it was possible to obtain a system of cores similar to that of the solar system , with a few planets with masses of a few tenths of an earth mass to an earth mass in the terrestrial zone and a more massive core a little bit further away ( fig .",
    "[ [ fig2 ] ] and lower panel of fig .",
    "[ [ fig4 ] ] ) .",
    "however , as the photoevaporation model predicts that the outer edge of the gap is receding rather fast , it is difficult to envision within this model how the massive core could accrete a gaseous envelope to become a giant planet .",
    "such a system of low mass planets is similar to those obtained by cossou et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and coleman & nelson ( 2016 ) in their models with inefficient migration .",
    "the exact parameters that should be used in such simulations are of course not known , and different outcomes could be produced by changing them .",
    "however , the point of this paper is to show that , by adopting reasonable parameters that fit the observations and the current understanding of planet formation and migration , systems of cores / planets can be obtained where all the planets do not end up on resonant chains near the disc s inner edge and delivery of material to the inner parts from the outer parts of the disc can be avoided .",
    "to that extent , the type of systems that we obtain resembles more our solar system than the systems observed by _ kepler _ , which is biased towards detecting planets on very tight orbits .",
    "our results predict that low mm flux transition disc may harbour terrestrial planets in the habitable zone .",
    "note that , as collisions between cores occur until rather late in the disc s evolution , dust may be produced at distances below 1 or 2  au from the central star even after the disc s inners parts have been accreted . in that case",
    ", the disc would not appear as transition disc .",
    "this study suggests that low mm flux transition discs may not be able to form giant planets before x  ray photoevaporation opens up a gap .",
    "these discs would then form planetary systems of the type obtained in this study : predominantly low mass planets at around 1  au with possibly more massive cores further away .",
    "high mm flux transition discs , by contrast , are associated with more massive stars and may form giant planets of a few jupiter masses , massive enough to open up a gap , before photoevaporation could proceed ."
