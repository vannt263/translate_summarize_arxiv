    "during its giant outburst in april 1997 , the nearby bl  lac object mkn  501 ( at redshift z=0.034 ) emitted photons up to @xmath4  tev and @xmath5  mev in the @xmath6-ray and x - ray bands , respectively , and has proved to be the most extreme tev - blazar observed so far ( e.g. catanese et al 1997 , pian et al 1998 , protheroe et al 1998 , quinn et al 1999 , aharonian et al 1999 ) .",
    "this energy is the highest so - far observed for any bl  lac object , and the flux is approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher than the synchrotron peak at its quiescent level .",
    "bepposax and osse observations ( maraschi 1999 ) suggest that the x - ray spectrum is curved at all epochs , and the spectrum during flaring has been fitted by a multiply - broken power - law ( bednarek & protheroe 1999 ) . comptel has not seen any significant signal from mkn  501 at any time ( collmar 1999 ) , while a @xmath7 upper limit of @xmath8@xmath9 s@xmath10 has been derived for the april 1997 egret viewing period ( catanese et al 1997 ) .    a flux increase at tev - energies was also observed with the whipple , hegra and cat telescopes ( catanese et al 1997 ) , with the most intense flare peaking on april 16 at a level @xmath11 times higher than during its quiescent flux .",
    "the non - detection of mkn  501 by egret indicates that most of the power output of the high energy component is in the gev - tev range .",
    "the tev - observations revealed a power - law spectrum with photon index @xmath12 up to @xmath13  tev and a gradual steepening up to 24  tev .",
    "the extragalactic diffuse infrared background leads to significant extinction of @xmath6-rays through @xmath14-pair production above 10  tev .",
    "the extinction - corrected tev - spectrum ( e.g. bednarek & protheroe 1999 ) , shows the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) peaking at @xmath12  tev .",
    "optical observations did not show any significant variations ( buckley & mcenery 1997 ) , indicating that the change in the low energy part of the sed was mainly confined to the x - ray band above @xmath15 kev .",
    "various models have been proposed to explain the observed @xmath16-ray emission from tev - blazars , all of which are identified as high - frequency peaked bl  lac objects .",
    "leptonic models , in which electrons inverse - compton scatter a population of low energy photons to high energies , currently dominate the thinking of the scientific community .",
    "because of the low luminosity of accretion disks in bl  lacs , the main target photons for the relativistic electrons would be the synchrotron photons produced by the same relativistic electron population , as in the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model .",
    "an alternative scenario for the production of the observed @xmath6-ray flux has been proposed involving pion photoproduction by energetic protons with subsequent synchrotron - pair cascades initiated by decay products ( photons and @xmath1 ) of the mesons ( e.g. mannheim et al 1991 , mannheim 1993 ) .",
    "these proton - initiated cascade ( pic ) models could , in principle , be distinguished by the observation of high energy neutrinos produced as a result of photoproduction .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the april 1997 flare of mkn  501 in the light of a modified synchrotron proton blazar ( spb ) model .",
    "we assume that electrons ( @xmath17 ) and protons ( @xmath18 ) are accelerated by 1st order fermi acceleration at the same shock .",
    "the relativistic @xmath17 radiate synchrotron photons which serve as the target radiation field for proton - photon interactions , and for the subsequent pair - synchrotron cascade which develops as a result of photon - photon pair production .",
    "this cascade redistributes the photon power to lower energies where the photons escape from the emission region , or `` blob , '' which moves relativistically in a direction closely aligned with our line - of - sight .    until recently , this model was not able to reproduce the general features of the double - humped blazar spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , but produced a rather featureless spectrum ( see e.g. mannheim 1993 ) , nor could it explain correlated x - ray / tev - variability . here , we present a comprehensive description of our monte - carlo simulations of a stationary spb model , including all relevant emission processes , and show that this model is indeed capable of reproducing a double - humped sed as observed . here , the origin of the tev - photons are proton synchrotron radiation , as first proposed by mcke & protheroe ( 1999 ) ; a similar model has also been proposed by aharonian ( 2000 ) , and rachen ( 1999 ) presented speculations about @xmath2- and proton - synchrotron radiation leading to narrow cascade spectra during flares , which might explain correlated x - ray / tev - variability .",
    "jet energetics and limits from particle shock acceleration , however , put severe constraints on this scenario .",
    "the goal of this paper is to discuss the physical processes included in our spb model monte - carlo code , and give the results of applying this code , as an example , to reproduce the sed of the giant flare from mkn  501 which occurred in april 1997 .",
    "a comprehensive study of the whole parameter - space ( magnetic field , doppler factor , etc . ) for this model will be the subject of a subsequent paper .    in section 2 , we discuss constraints on the maximum particle energies imposed by the co - acceleration scenario , and by the pion production threshold .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the emission processes in the present model .",
    "energy losses and particle production are treated in sect .",
    "3.1 , while the cascade calculations , including a brief description of our code , are outlined in sect . 3.2 . in sect .",
    "4 we apply our model to the april 1997 flare of mkn  501 .",
    "the multifrequency photon spectrum is shown in sect .",
    "4.1 , while in sect .",
    "4.2 the predicted neutrino spectrum is discussed .",
    "we conclude with a discussion and summary in section 5 .",
    "in the present model , shock accelerated protons ( @xmath18 ) interact in the synchrotron photon field generated by the electrons ( @xmath17 ) co - accelerated at the same shock .",
    "this scenario may put constraints on the maximum achievable particle energies .",
    "the usual process considered for accelerating charged particles in high energy astrophysics is diffusive shock acceleration ( see e.g. bell 1978 , drury 1983 , blandford & eichler 1987 , biermann & strittmatter 1987 , jokipii 1987 , jones & ellison 1991 ) , in which particles undergo collisionless scattering , e.g. by alfvn waves , in the upstream and downstream plasma",
    ". charged particles with gyroradii larger than the thickness of the shock front propagate with diffusion coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the upstream and downstream plasma , respectively , for propagation parallel to the shock normal . in the shock frame the plasma flow velocity changes from @xmath21 in the upstream region to @xmath22 in the downstream region . in this paper , for simplicity we restrict ourselves to non - relativistic shocks , and postpone discussion of relativistic shock acceleration to a later paper .",
    "the acceleration time scale for non - relativistic shocks is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the compression ratio for the case of strong shocks in a non - relativistic monoatomic ideal gas .",
    "if the magnetic field is governed by an ordered component , the orientation of the shock normal to the main magnetic field direction becomes important .",
    "in general , the diffusion coefficient can be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the angle between the magnetic field and the axis connecting the upstream ( @xmath27 ) and downstream ( @xmath28 ) regions . in the diffusion limit",
    ", kinetic theory relates the parallel and perpendicular diffusion coefficients through @xmath29\\kappa_{\\perp}=\\frac{1}{3}\\lambda_{||}\\beta c\\ ] ] where @xmath30 with @xmath31 being the mean free path parallel to the magnetic field , @xmath32 is the particle s gyroradius , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the particle s mass and lorentz factor , respectively , and @xmath35 is the magnetic field strength in the upstream region .",
    "the mean free path is , in general , a function of the particle energy through its gyroradius , and is dependent on the spectrum of the magnetic turbulence .",
    "in the small angle scattering approximation ( i.e. , if alfvn waves dominate the particle deflection with wavelength equal to the particle gyroradius ; see drury 1983 ) we have @xmath36 this spectrum @xmath37 is usually expressed as a power law of the wave number @xmath38 in the turbulent magnetic field : @xmath39 @xmath40 corresponds to kolmogorov turbulence which may be common in astrophysical environments ( biermann & strittmatter 1987 ) , while @xmath41 corresponds to bohm diffusion , and is often considered for simplicity . for strong magnetic fields , kraichnan turbulence @xmath42 ( kraichnan 1965 ) may be present . in the following ,",
    "we consider @xmath43 as a free parameter .",
    "the mean free path may then be expressed as ( see biermann & strittmatter 1987 ) @xmath44 @xmath45 ^{-1 } \\hspace*{.3cm}\\mbox{for}\\hspace*{.3cm}\\delta=1\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the ratio of the turbulent to ambient magnetic energy density , @xmath47 is the gyroradius of the most energetic protons , and has the same order of magnitude as the system size , and @xmath48 corresponds to the smallest turbulence scale .",
    "the mean free path , and consequently the acceleration time at maximum energy is only slightly dependent on the turbulence spectrum in the case of protons , whereas for electrons the acceleration time at maximum energy shows a strong dependence on the magnetic turbulence spectrum adopted .",
    "we expect @xmath49 , since otherwise the energy density in particles would not be able to be confined by the ambient field ( biermann & strittmatter 1987 ) . with these relations , the acceleration time scale may be re - written as @xmath50 where @xmath51\\ ] ] the diffusion approximation used here limits the maximum mean free path to @xmath52 ( jokipii 1987 ) . if the particle spectra are cut off due to synchrotron losses , balancing the acceleration time scale with the loss time scale determines the maximum lorentz factors of protons , @xmath53^{-1/2}\\ ] ] and electrons @xmath54^{-1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is in gauss .",
    "the ratio of the maximum proton lorentz factor to the maximum electron lorentz factor is then @xmath55^{1/2 } \\label{eq : gammamax_ratio}\\ ] ] where the equality corresponds to the maximum proton energy being determined by synchrotron losses , and the inequality to the maximum proton energy being determined instead by adiabatic losses . for parallel shocks",
    "this relation is consistent with the results found by biermann & strittmatter ( 1987 ) .",
    "the corresponding acceleration time scales at the maximum particle energies , if determined by synchrotron losses , are @xmath56^{1/2 } \\;\\;\\;\\ ; { \\rm s } \\label{eq : tacc_p}\\ ] ] for protons , and @xmath57^{1/2 } \\;\\;\\;\\ ; { \\rm s}\\ ] ] for electrons . in the present paper",
    ", we shall adopt @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . the geometry dependent term @xmath61^{1/2}$ ] is plotted in fig .",
    "1a as the dashed curves for different @xmath62 values and @xmath60 .",
    "it can be seen that highly oblique shocks allow proton acceleration on very short time scales . in the limiting case of a perpendicular shock , drift",
    " shock acceleration drives the energy gain , and the finite size of the shock front restricts the maximum particle energy .",
    "the maximum proton lorentz factor @xmath63 is reached for the maximum drift distance , the shock size , and is given by @xmath64 with @xmath65 in cm and @xmath35 in gauss .    at their maximum lorentz factors ,",
    "the acceleration process for protons is considerably slower than for electrons , and so the proton acceleration time must be consistent with the observed variability time , @xmath66 , @xmath67 where @xmath68 the doppler factor .",
    "this can be converted to a constraint on the geometry dependent term using eq .",
    "[ eq : tacc_p ] , and is plotted as a function of @xmath69 in fig .",
    "1a for a typical set of tev - blazar parameters ( @xmath70  g , @xmath71 , @xmath72  hours ) .",
    "the region below the solid line is allowed by the variability constraint ( eq .  [ eq : varcon ] ) , and gives for each @xmath62 value a minimum shock angle between @xmath73 and @xmath74 , depending on @xmath62 .",
    "thus , proton shock acceleration on hour time scale in hadronic models can only take place in oblique shocks , and the maximum drift distance may restrict the maximum energy gain rather than the gyroradius .",
    "using the same shock geometry and magnetic turbulence spectra for both protons and electrons , we find that the ratio @xmath75 does not vary by more than a factor of 2 within the allowed shock angle range ( see fig .",
    "1b ) , allowing us to adopt an average value for this ratio for a given parameter combination .",
    "inserting this ratio into eq .",
    "[ eq : gammamax_ratio ] then restricts the ratio of the allowed maximum particle energies to the range below the solid lines shown in fig .  2 .",
    "points exactly on this line represent models where the particle spectra are limited by synchrotron losses and the acceleration time scale is exactly the variability time scale ; points below this line apply if adiabatic losses are dominant for protons or the proton acceleration time scale is shorter than the variability time scale in the jet frame .",
    "we note that for a given maximum proton energy , the highest maximum electron energy occurs with bohm diffusion .    in hadronic blazar models pion",
    "photoproduction is essential for neutrino production .",
    "the threshold for this process is given by @xmath76  gev where @xmath77 is the maximum photon energy of the target field , which in the synchrotron proton blazar models is in turn produced by the co - accelerated @xmath78 . in the @xmath79-function approximation for the synchrotron emission ,",
    "@xmath80 with @xmath81  g. inserting @xmath77 into the threshold condition , we find @xmath82 and this is shown in fig .  2 as the dashed lines for various magnetic field strengths . together with eq .  11 the allowed range of maximum particle energies is then restricted to the area below the solid lines and above the dashed lines in fig .  2 , as shown for example as the shaded area for @xmath83  g and kolmogorov turbulence",
    ". inspecting hadronic models as presented in the literature ( e.g. mannheim 1993 , mannheim et al 1996 , rachen 1999 ) , we find that most models which are able to fit the observations lie above the bohm diffusion line ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , indicating that the turbulence spectrum required in common hadronic blazar jet models is likely to be of kolmogorov / kraichnan type . rachen ( 1999 ) speculates that the transition between kolmogorov and kraichnan type turbulence could be responsible for the difference between low- and high frequency peaked bl  lacs .",
    "in the present model , the co - accelerated @xmath78 are assumed to produce most of the _ observed _ low energy part of the sed by synchrotron radiation , and this is assumed to be the target radiation field for @xmath84 interactions and subsequent cascading .",
    "the observed hardening of the spectrum with rising flux , has recently been convincingly reproduced by a shock model with escape and synchrotron losses ( kirk et al 1998 ) .",
    "the spectral slopes in this model are controlled by synchrotron cooling , and thus naturally explain the temporal behaviour of the spectral index as observed in the x - ray band .",
    "the flaring behaviour is explained by the shock front running into plasma whose density is locally enhanced , and which thus increases the number of particles injected into the acceleration process .",
    "the increase in the plasma density is accompanied by an increase in the magnetic field , leading to a higher acceleration rate and a shift of the maximum particle energies to higher energies .",
    "this picture departs from the standard explanation in which the flat synchrotron spectra appear as a result of a superposition of several local self - absorbed synchrotron spectra with changing self - absorption frequency , adopted in previous pic models ( e.g. mannheim 1993 ) .    for simplicity , and because we do not wish to include additional parameters , we use the same magnetic field for synchrotron radiation as for acceleration . for normal shocks",
    "this approximation is justified as the magnetic fields either side of the shock are similar .",
    "this approximation might even be justified for oblique shocks as a lower magnetic field in the upstream region , compared to the downstream region , implies a higher diffusion coefficient and time spent upstream , increasing the synchrotron losses there and partially compensating for having a lower field upstream .",
    "also , at oblique shocks , reflection at the shock front itself is thought to be more important than diffusion in the downstream region ( kirk & heavens 1989 ) , so that accelerating particles spend most of their time upstream .",
    "in addition , we assume that pitch - angle scattering maintains quasi - isotropic particle distributions , and all radiating particles are confined to the homogeneous emission region .",
    "there are several energy loss / interaction processes which are important for protons , electrons and photons in a dense radiation field produced by relativistic electrons co - accelerated along with the protons : protons interact with photons , resulting in pion production and ( bethe - heitler ) pair production ; electrons , muons , protons and charged pions emit synchrotron radiation ; photons interact with photons by pair production",
    ". we shall show below that , for the present model , inverse compton emission by the electrons can be neglected .    for simplicity",
    "we represent the observed synchrotron spectrum of mrk  501 during flaring , the target photon field for the @xmath84-collisions and photon - photon pair production , as a broken power - law : @xmath85    for determining the photon density of the target field , the dimension of the emission region , assumed to be spherical , must be known .",
    "this can be estimated by setting the photon crossing time equal to the variability time scale ( in the jet frame  in the remainder of this section all quantities are in the jet frame unless noted otherwise ) , making the implicit assumption that the light crossing time scale determines the flux variations .",
    "the observed variability time scale can , in general , depend on : ( i ) the injection time scale for the energetic particles @xmath86 ; ( ii ) the time needed for converting their energy into radiation , i.e. their energy loss time scale @xmath87 ; ( iii ) the effective light crossing time @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the geometrical blob radius and @xmath90 is the energy dependent probability for photons escaping from the blob taking account of @xmath91-pair production and diffusion during cascading .",
    "hence , @xmath92    for leptonic models , the time scales for energy losses and acceleration are typically significantly shorter than the crossing time , i.e. @xmath93,@xmath94 , and thus the radius of the emission region can be derived from the observed variability time scale . in addition , the emission region is assumed to be optically thin at 1 tev and x - ray energies , implying that @xmath95 , where @xmath96 , @xmath97 are the dimensions of the emitting region at 1  tev and x - ray energies , respectively .",
    "this differs in two points from the hadronic blazar jet models : firstly , the optical depth of the emission region is strongly energy dependent , leading to an effective , i.e. observed , thickness of the emission region @xmath98 , which also depends on the energy .",
    "diffusion can be neglected during cascading since the cascade processes are of leptonic origin , and are , in general , more rapid than diffusion .",
    "thus , in spb models the crossing time scale in the optically thick tev - band is related to the crossing time scale at x - ray energies ( optically thin ) , through @xmath99 /\\tau_{\\gamma\\gamma,\\rm{tev}}\\ ] ] ( averaging over a homogeneous emission volume ; see rachen 1999 ) .",
    "hence , @xmath100 is the relevant time scale for estimating the radius @xmath101 of the emission region .",
    "secondly , the acceleration and/or energy loss time scales can be of the same order of magnitude as the crossing time scale .",
    "acceleration , however , is always faster than the energy losses of the accelerating particles up to their maximum energy . note that because of the leptonic nature of the cascade processes , the energy loss time scale will in general be determined by the ( slower ) hadronic processes . as a further consequence ,",
    "flux variations are not significantly washed out by the cascading mechanism , but closely follow the crossing or hadronic loss time scales .",
    "if @xmath102 the crossing time scale determines the flux variations , and in this case we can estimate the radius of the emission region through @xmath103 with @xmath104 . in our present model",
    ", efficient proton synchrotron emission determines the tev - bump in the blazar sed , and so at the maximum proton energy @xmath105 .",
    "the adiabatic loss time scale due to expansion is ( longair 1994 ) @xmath106 assuming magnetic flux conservation @xmath107 , and so @xmath108 is related to the size of the emission region @xmath89 . since @xmath109 for the highest proton energies in our model responsible for the tev - emission , @xmath110 , and",
    "so the size of the emission region can be determined by the variability time scale .",
    "the shortest doubling time measured by the whipple telescope in the 1997 data of mkn  501 was approximately 2 hours ( quinn et al 1999 ) , while hegra reported a lower doubling time of 15 hours ( aharonian et al 1999 ) or 12 hours ( krawczynski 1999 ) .",
    "as a working hypothesis we adopt here a variability time scale of 12  hours , but will discuss also effects of smaller variability time scales . for @xmath111",
    "hours we find @xmath112 cm for @xmath71 .",
    "12 and 13 imply that the acceleration time scale for electrons is much smaller than for protons at their maximum energies , @xmath113 .",
    "if a @xmath114-ray outburst thus corresponds to particle acceleration of a single @xmath115 population , then an increase of the low energy synchrotron flux will occur before the tev - flare .",
    "the amount of the lag depends on the proton acceleration time , and so on the shock parameters , in particular the diffusion coefficients .",
    "e.g. for the present model and the kolmogorov spectrum @xmath116  s ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , which for d=10 suggests a time lag of @xmath117  hours . for bohm diffusion ,",
    "the time lag would be @xmath118  hours .",
    "these time lags are consistent with current observational constraints .    the relevant radiation and loss time scales for photomeson production , bethe - heitler pair production , @xmath18 synchrotron radiation , and adiabatic losses due to jet expansion , are shown in fig .  3 together with the acceleration time scale",
    "synchrotron losses , which turn out to be at least as important as losses due to photopion production in our model , limit the injected @xmath18 spectrum to a lorentz factor of @xmath119 for the assumed model parameters .",
    "we adopt a kolmogorov spectrum of turbulence for the magnetic field structure ( @xmath120 ) , and so for any @xmath121 value , variability arguments constrain the shock angle to @xmath122 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the maximum proton energy could then be achieved , e.g. , with @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "this is in agreement with the limit imposed on quasi - perpendicular shocks due to their finite shock size .",
    "note that due to the non - zero shock angle , the acceleration time scale shown in fig .",
    "3 does not follow a strict power - law , but is curved .",
    "this is due to the non - linear dependence of @xmath126 on the particle s gyroradius ( see eqs .",
    "a @xmath127 proton spectrum , typical of shock accelerated particles , is used for @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is obtained from requiring @xmath130 at @xmath131 .",
    "rachen & mszros ( 1998 ) noted the importance of synchrotron losses of @xmath2 ( and @xmath3 ) prior to their decay in agn jets and grbs .",
    "the critical lorentz factors @xmath132 and @xmath133 , above which synchrotron losses in the assumed magnetic field dominate over decay , lie below the maximum lorentz factor for @xmath2 and above the maximum lorentz factor for @xmath3 .",
    "thus , while @xmath3-synchrotron losses can safely be ignored , @xmath2-synchrotron losses should be included .    for the parameters employed in this work we receive a target photon energy density of @xmath134 , and a magnetic field energy density of @xmath135 using @xmath83  g. with @xmath136 significant inverse compton radiation from the co - accelerated @xmath78",
    "is not expected .",
    "we also neglect secondary production interactions of relativistic protons with the ambient thermal plasma . in the present model",
    "the dominant loss process turns out to be proton synchrotron radiation .",
    "thus , our assumption is justified if the thermal proton density does not exceed @xmath137  @xmath138 . in section  4 we estimate the number density of cold protons to be less than this for reasonable values of the jet width .",
    "for the first time in the context of the spb - model , we use the monte - carlo technique to simulate particle production and cascade development , and this allows us to use exact cross sections . for photomeson production",
    "we use the monte - carlo code sophia ( mcke et al 2000 ) , and bethe - heitler pair production is simulated using the code of protheroe & johnson ( 1996 ) .",

    "this approximation is equivalent to assuming that @xmath190 which is justified because of the very short synchrotron life time of electrons in the assumed magnetic field .    a matrix method ( e.g. johnson et al 1996 ) is then used to follow the pair - synchrotron cascade in the ambient synchrotron radiation field and magnetic field .",
    "the cascades are considered in the jet frame . here , electron and photon fluxes are represented by vectors @xmath191 and @xmath192 , which give the total number of electrons in the energy bin at energy @xmath193 and number of photons at energy @xmath194 , respectively , in the @xmath38th cascade generation .",

    "the vectors and matrices are calculated taking care of energy conservation .",
    "the photon and electron fluxes due to synchrotron radiation and photon - photon pair production are then calculated through matrix multiplication .",
    "we start by calculating the number of @xmath0-decay photons which pair produce in the blob @xmath204 where the vector @xmath205 gives the number of @xmath0-decay gamma - rays at an energy @xmath194 ( the emerging photons , i.e. those which do not pair produce in the blob , are stored in an array ) . the electron spectrum due to photon - photon pair production",
    "is then given by @xmath206 these electrons radiate synchrotron photons , and the resulting photon yield is determined by @xmath207 this is the 1st cascade generation photon spectrum , which in turn again suffers photon - photon pair production on the target photon field in the blob , etc . in our calculation , we iterate until @xmath208 at any energy @xmath194 , or stop at 10 generations .    we have injected @xmath209 protons at each proton energy equally spaced in @xmath210 at 0.1 decade intervals from @xmath211  gev to the maximum injection energy .",
    "these protons are assumed to be continuously isotropized , and interact with the synchrotron radiation field of the co - accelerated @xmath78 through pion production and bethe - heitler pair production .",
    "the resulting neutrinos ( see sect .",
    "4.1 ) escape without further interaction , but the @xmath1 and high energy @xmath114-rays initiate cascades . the resulting particle spectra were weighted with @xmath212 , appropriate to the assumed proton injection spectrum , and divided by the number of injected protons , and by @xmath213 steradians . figs .",
    "4 and 5 show examples of cascade spectra in the observer s frame initiated by photons with different origins for model parameters ( given above ) , which satisfactorily reproduce the flare spectrum of mkn  501 .",
    "our monte - carlo program only treats the first interactions of protons , and so we must take account of this when making the final flux predictions . in the case of pion production ,",
    "a fraction @xmath214 of the initial proton energy goes into particle production , and @xmath215 of the time the emerging nucleon is a neutron , and is assumed to escape from the blob without further interaction . combining these two factors , the resulting spectra must be multiplied by 2.01 to take account of subsequent pion production interactions .",
    "similarly , the multiplication factor which takes account of subsequent bethe - heitler pair production interactions is @xmath13 .",
    "particle spectra due to pion production and bethe - heitler pair production are then weighted according to their mean interaction rates , i.e. @xmath216 for pion production , and @xmath217 for bethe - heitler pair production where @xmath218 is the total interaction rate , taking into account adiabatic losses of the protons due to jet expansion approximated by eq .  18 .",
    "adiabatic jet expansion also affects the radius of the emission region , its photon density and magnetic field , and thereby the probability for @xmath84-interactions and the subsequent cascade development . with the expansion of the emission region , the probability for @xmath84-interactions decreases because of the decrease of the photon energy density and magnetic field .",
    "it follows that @xmath84-interactions , and their resulting cascades , most likely take place during the _ initial _ phase of the jet expansion , and so we neglect any effects on the emerging cascade spectra due to changes in magnetic field or dimension of the emission region .",
    "in particular , the flare rise - time can be much shorter than the expansion and light crossing time scales if one associates it with the onset of the @xmath84-interactions and their resulting cascades .",
    "short rise - times and longer flare decay time scales are typically observed in blazar light curves .",
    "finally , we transform the cascade spectrum to the observer s frame . for calculating the distance , @xmath219 and @xmath220  km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 are used .",
    "cascades initiated by photons from @xmath0 decay , `` @xmath0 cascades '' , or by electrons from @xmath221 decay , `` @xmath3 cascades '' , ( fig .",
    "4 ) produce rather featureless spectra ( see also mannheim et al 1993 ) . however , cascades initiated by protons `` @xmath18-synchrotron cascades '' , and by muons from @xmath221 decay , `` @xmath2-synchrotron cascades '' ( fig .",
    "5b ) produce a double - humped sed as observed for @xmath114-ray blazars ( see also rachen 1999 ) . the contribution from bethe - heitler pair production turns out to be negligible ( fig .",
    "5a ) . in the model for mkn  501 presented here ,",
    "the synchrotron flux from directly accelerated @xmath78 significantly exceeds the reprocessed @xmath167 and @xmath18 synchrotron flux .",
    "thus , in the present mkn  501 model direct proton and muon synchrotron radiation is mainly responsible for the high energy hump whereas the low energy hump is mainly synchrotron radiation by the directly accelerated @xmath78 . in the present model photons up to 1  tev in the jet frame",
    "are optically thin to @xmath91-pair production .",
    "thus , only a small fraction of the power emitted as proton synchrotron radiation is redistributed to lower energies via cascading . for models where the optical depth of tev - photons is significantly higher",
    ", a correspondingly larger fraction of the tev - bump may be redistributed to x - ray energies . in these models ,",
    "the pairs produced by photons of the `` high energy hump '' may contribute considerably to the observed x - ray bump , whereas in the present model they are negligible in comparison to the directly accelerated electrons .",
    "we note that for the case of strong magnetic fields where @xmath2-synchrotron cascades cause detectable humps , the @xmath18 cascade spectrum dominates in general over the @xmath2 cascade spectrum .",
    "adding the four components of the cascade spectra in fig .  4 - 5",
    "we obtain the sed shown in fig .  6 where it is compared with the multifrequency observations of the 16 april 1997 flare of mkn  501 .",
    "we use the parametrization of bednarek & protheroe ( 1999 ) to represent the bepposax+osse data ( thick straight line at low energies ) .",
    "the broken power - law simplification ( eq .  [ eq : broken_pl ] ) used as the target radiation field for @xmath84-interactions and @xmath91 interactions is shown by the chain line .",
    "the 100  mev upper limit from catanese et al ( 1997 ) is nearly simultaneous to the tev - flare observations . the tev - flux , corrected for pair production on the cosmic background radiation field ( bednarek & protheroe 1999 ) for two different background models , is shown as the thick curves .",
    "the parameters used for modeling the april 1997 flare are : @xmath222 , @xmath83  g , radius of the emission region @xmath223  cm . for a target photon field for the @xmath84-interactions , and the cascades as given in eq .",
    "16 , we find a photon energy density of this radiation field of @xmath224  gev/@xmath138 .",
    "the accelerated protons are assumed to follow a power law @xmath225 between @xmath226 , and in order to fit the emerging cascade spectra to the data a proton number density of @xmath227  @xmath138 , corresponding to an energy density of accelerated protons of @xmath228  tev/@xmath138 is required . with a magnetic field energy density of @xmath229",
    "tev/@xmath138 our model satisfies @xmath230 ( all parameters are in the co - moving frame of the jet ) , confirming that a significant contribution from inverse - compton scattering is not expected .    to calculate the total jet luminosity @xmath231 , measured in the rest frame of the galaxy , we adapt the formulae of bicknell ( 1994 ) and bicknell & dopita ( 1997 ) given for the synchrotron self - compton model to apply for the case of our proton blazar model .",
    "we receive @xmath232\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath233 is a good approximation to the lorentz factor of jets closely aligned to the line of sight , and the four terms inside the bracket give the relative contributions to the total jet power of cold protons , accelerated protons , magnetic field , and accelerated electrons , respectively . the contribution from cold protons is estimated on the basis of charge neutrality . @xmath234 and @xmath235 are the observed bolometric fluxes of the low and high energy component , respectively , and @xmath236 , @xmath237 are the radiative efficiencies for electrons and protons .",
    "@xmath238 with @xmath239 the luminosity distance , @xmath240/3 $ ] and @xmath241 gives the jet - frame pressure of relativistic protons that would apply in the absense of energy loss mechanisms , and @xmath242 we use this formula to estimate the total jet power to be @xmath243  erg / s , and we find the contributions to the total jet power of cold protons , magnetic field , and accelerated electrons , relative to that of accelerated protons , to be 0.8 , 1 , and 0.01 , respectively , with a number density of cold protons @xmath244  @xmath138 .",
    "thus , for the shock acceleration mechanism we require more power per particle going into relativistic protons than into electrons .",
    "7 shows the dependence of the total jet luminosity on the doppler factor @xmath68 with fixed parameters @xmath245  hours , @xmath58 , and with @xmath35 , @xmath65 , @xmath246 and @xmath247 being of mkn  501 during flaring .",
    "clearly visible is the fact that in hadronic models the proton kinetic energy and the poynting flux dominate the total jet luminosity , while the electron kinetic energy is only of minor importance . at high doppler factors",
    "the emission region becomes so large that one needs only relatively small magnetic fields and proton densities to fit the observations .",
    "in addition , adiabatic losses become small resulting in a decrease of the required kinetic proton luminosity .",
    "for example , @xmath248  g and @xmath249  @xmath138 are sufficient to fit the mkn  501 flare for @xmath250 , while for @xmath251 magnetic fields of over 30  g and proton densities of @xmath252  @xmath138 are needed .",
    "the total jet luminosity exhibits a minimum of @xmath243erg / s at around @xmath253 , which corresponds to the model we have chosen to present here .",
    "smaller variability time scales in the shock acceleration model can only be explained by quasi - perpendicular shocks with a large mean free path ( see fig .",
    "1a ) , which in turn are only consistent with the diffusion approximation for low shock speeds .",
    "due to the size limit of the shock , the maximum energy gain is then limited to significantly lower values , and one may not reach tev - photon energies in the proton synchrotron model , unless the magnetic field is increased accordingly , which in turn leads to larger jet luminosities . for example , for @xmath254 and a variability time scale of 12  hours , at least b=20  g is needed to comply with all acceleration constraints . for @xmath255  hours , one needs at least 50  g. in comparison , leptonic models would give a minimum jet luminosity of @xmath256  erg / s for this flare ( ghisellini 1998 ) , about two orders of magnitude lower .",
    "this is due to the much lower magnetic fields invoked there , and the less massive particles which drive the kinetic flow .    in the framework of the jet ",
    "( e.g. falcke & biermann 1995 ) , the jet luminosity should not exceed the total accretion power @xmath257 for the equilibrium state .",
    "accretion theory relates the disk luminosity to the accretion power .",
    "page & thorne ( 1974 ) give @xmath258 .",
    "disk luminosities for typical radio - loud agn lie in the range @xmath259  erg / s with bl  lac objects tending to the lower end on average .",
    "specifically , for mkn  501 there are no emission line measurements available , and this complicates the evaluation of the disk luminosity for this object .",
    "however , any observed uv - emission in the flaring stage may put an upper limit on it .",
    "again only historical data are available here , leaving room for speculation .",
    "we estimate @xmath260  erg / s ( mufson et al 1984 , pian et al 1998 ) , and obtain for the accretion power , @xmath261  erg / s , at least a factor 5 below the necessary value to comply with the constraint of the disk  jet symbiosis .",
    "note , however , that the estimate of @xmath257 is based on archival non - flaring data from mkn  501 , and we could speculate that either the disk has pushed more energy into the jet during tev - flaring , or that the flaring stage can not be considered as a steady state . also , accretion theory might predict larger conversion efficiencies of the accretion power into disk radiation than actually might occur in bl  lac objects .",
    "it is also instructive to consider the radiative efficiency of the proposed model in comparison to alternative models . using eq .",
    "29 we estimate the radiation efficiency of the protons we find @xmath262 .",
    "this is similar to the value of @xmath237 in the proton - blazar model proposed by mannheim ( 1993 ) , and is fully in agreement with the results presented by celotti & fabian ( 1993 ) on a basis of a sample of 105 sources . in comparison",
    ", leptonic models would give two orders of magnitude higher radiation efficiencies .",
    "unlike leptonic models , hadronic blazar models may result in neutrino emission through the production and decay of charged mesons , e.g. @xmath263 followed by @xmath264 .",
    "neutrinos escape without further interaction , and the predicted neutrino spectrum from mkn  501 during flaring is shown in fig .",
    "we calculate the @xmath265-emission from the source itself , and do not include here any additional contribution from escaping cosmic rays interacting while propagating through the cosmic microwave background radiation ( see e.g. protheroe and johnson 1996 ) .",
    "the proton injection spectrum is modified by the photo - hadronic interaction rate which approximately follows a @xmath266 power - law for proton energies above @xmath267  gev ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , where the nucleons interact preferably in the flatter part of the target photon spectrum ( @xmath268  kev ) to produce mesons . this causes the resulting neutrino spectrum above @xmath269  gev to be @xmath270 , whereas below this energy , the target photon field for pion production is the steeper part ( 1.6  kev @xmath271  kev ) , and the corresponding neutrino spectrum is @xmath272 . at even lower energies",
    "a further flattening is due to pion production by the lowest energy protons at threshold .",
    "there is a steepening in the spectrum above @xmath273  gev which needs some comment here .",
    "neutrinos with energy @xmath274  gev are mostly produced near threshold in the @xmath275-resonance region , while the higher energy neutrinos are mainly produced in the secondary resonant region of the pion production cross section .",
    "@xmath276 production is suppressed in the @xmath275-resonance , and hence we find a suppression of @xmath277-emission in comparison to @xmath278 emission at low energies , whereas @xmath279 and @xmath276 multiplicities are comparable at higher cm energies , leading to roughly equal fluxes of @xmath278 and @xmath277 .",
    "the effects of @xmath2-synchrotron emission show up as a break at @xmath280  gev in the observer s frame , whereas @xmath3-synchrotron emission turns out to be unimportant in our model .",
    "another important source of high energy neutrinos is the production and decay of charged kaons . in the case of @xmath281-interactions",
    "positively charged kaons are produced , and are important in the secondary resonance region of the cross section ( mcke et al 1999 , mcke et al 2000 ) .",
    "they decay in @xmath282 of all cases into muons and direct high energy muon - neutrinos .",
    "in contrast to the neutrinos originating from @xmath3 and @xmath2-decay , these muon - neutrinos will not have suffered energy losses through @xmath3- and @xmath2-synchrotron radiation , and therefore appear as an excess in comparison to the remaining neutrino flavors at the high energy end ( @xmath283@xmath284  gev ) of the emerging neutrino spectrum , and in addition cause the total neutrino spectrum to extend to @xmath285  gev .",
    "in contrast to previous spb - jet models in which one expected equal photon and neutrino energy fluxes ( e.g. mannheim 1993 , 1995 ) , our model predicts a peak neutrino energy flux approximately two orders of magnitude lower than high energy gamma - rays .",
    "this is due to the synchrotron losses of protons being dominant , leading to gamma - ray emission at the expense of neutrino emission .",
    "this paper describes an application of our newly - developed monte carlo program which simulates a modified version of the stationary spb - model .",
    "the monte carlo technique allows us to use exact cross sections , and all important emission processes are considered here . as an example , we have used our code to model the giant april 1997 tev - flare from mkn  501 . here",
    ", the tev - photons are due to synchrotron radiation of the relativistic protons in the highly magnetized emission region .",
    "this proton synchrotron model was first proposed by mcke & protheroe ( 1999 ) ; a similar model for tev emission in mrk  501 has just been proposed by aharonian ( 2000 ) , and his conclusions regarding the required doppler factor and magnetic field are very similar to ours .",
    "our model departs from the standard spb model as introduced first by mannheim and co - workers mainly in two areas : ( i ) we use the _ observed _ synchrotron radiation as the target photon field for @xmath84-interactions and pair - synchrotron cascades assuming it to be produced by co - accelerated electrons , and ( ii ) our model takes into account synchrotron radiation from muons and protons .",
    "the model parameters derived assuming diffusive shock acceleration of @xmath78 and @xmath18 in a kolmogorov turbulence spectrum are consistent with the x - ray to tev - data in the flare state .",
    "however , the total jet power we obtain is too large to comply with the steady - state jet  disk symbiosis scenario , but then we are not dealing with a stready - state phenomenon .    while the emerging cascade sed initiated by @xmath0 decay and @xmath3 synchrotron photons turns out to be relatively featureless , as was also found by , e.g. , mannheim ( 1993 ) , the @xmath2 ( see also rachen 1999 , and rachen & mannheim 2000 ) and , more importantly , the proton synchrotron radiation and its cascade produces a double - humped sed as is commonly observed in flaring blazars . for the present model",
    ", we find that proton synchrotron radiation dominates the tev emission , while the contribution of the synchrotron radiation from the pairs , produced by photon - photon interactions of gamma - rays from the high energy hump is only minor .",
    "our model considers the emission region to be homogeneous .",
    "inhomogeneities in particle density , magnetic field , etc . within",
    "the source would result in a broader x - ray and tev - peak in the sed .",
    "this indicates that for mkn  501 a homogeneous model of the emission region seems to be appropriate .",
    "being a hadronic model , our model predicts neutrino emission and we give the expected neutrino flux of mrk  501 during flaring . comparing our predicted neutrino flux with that for previous proton blazar models ( e.g. mannheim 1993 )",
    ", we find that the neutrino output in our model is significantly less than was previously estimated due to the synchrotron losses dominating the energy losses of protons , producing synchrotron @xmath114-rays at the expense of @xmath0 @xmath114-rays and neutrinos .",

    "<S> using a monte carlo / numerical technique to simulate the interactions and subsequent cascading of the accelerated protons , we are able to fit the high - energy gamma - ray portion of the observed sed of markarian 501 during the april 1997 flare . we find that the emerging cascade spectra initiated by gamma - rays from @xmath0 decay and by @xmath1 from @xmath2 decay turn out to be relatively featureless . </S>",
    "<S> synchrotron radiation produced by @xmath2 from @xmath3 decay , and even more importantly by protons , and subsequent synchrotron - pair cascading , is able to reproduce well the high energy part of the sed . for this fit </S>",
    "<S> we find that synchrotron radiation by protons dominates the tev emission , pion photoproduction being less important with the consequence that we predict a lower neutrino flux than in other proton blazar models .    </S>",
