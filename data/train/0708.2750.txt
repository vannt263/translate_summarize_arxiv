    "measurements of luminosity distances to type ia supernovae ( e ) have played a central role in cosmology , leading two independent groups to the remarkable discovery of an unknown , presently - dominant component of the universe , dark energy , and strong evidence for an accelerating universe @xcite .",
    "current surveys that target high - redshift e  from the ground  the canada - france - hawaii telescope supernova legacy survey (; @xcite ) and the equation of state : supernovae trace cosmic expansion (;",
    "@xcite )  and from space using the _ _ @xcite have substantially increased the sample of high-@xmath1 e , and have provided much - improved statistical constraints on the expansion history of the universe .",
    "the discovery of cosmic acceleration was made possible in part through extensive observations of nearby type ia e  by the caln / tololo supernova search @xcite and by the  follow - up program @xcite , and by studies pioneered by @xcite and by @xcite of the relationship between peak brightness and light curve decline rate @xcite .",
    "current low - redshift  surveys and follow - up programs ( lick observatory supernova search  ; @xcite , carnegie supernova project  ; @xcite , nearby supernova factory  actory ; @xcite , and the   group ) , are continuing to discover e  and compile a large number of high - quality multicolor light curves as well as multi - epoch optical spectra of ea  to expand the library of local training data used as `` templates '' .",
    "these high - quality data sets will be indispensable for calibrating the brightness - decline relation to high precision . obtaining and studying multi - epoch spectra are also important for computing improved @xmath2-corrections and minimizing systematic uncertainties @xcite .",
    "recent spectroscopic modeling efforts have also led to a better understanding of the physical mechanism responsible for the observed brightness - decline relation ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .    as one of the three primary scientific components of the sloan digital sky survey - ii ( ) , the supernova survey takes repeated imaging scans of the same 300  square degrees of the sky during the fall seasons of 2005  2007 to search for and measure light curves of e. the imaging survey is complemented by an extensive spectroscopic follow - up program to confirm the  type and measure redshifts , and to study the detailed spectral properties of a sample of selected events .",
    "this program exploits the unique capabilities of the  2.5 m telescope @xcite and its  imaging camera @xcite to survey a large volume of space at moderately high cadence .",
    "the survey complements and improves upon other low - z and high - z surveys in several important ways .",
    "the wide field - of - view camera operating in drift scan mode allows for efficient discoveries of type ia e  at @xmath3 , a redshift interval that is not easily probed by other existing surveys that target either known nearby galaxies ( low-@xmath1 ) or narrow pencil - beam volumes ( high-@xmath1 ) .",
    "its well - calibrated multi - band photometric system ( @xmath4 ; @xcite ) enables precise measurements of supernova light curves with controlled systematics .",
    "the absolute magnitude scale is accurate to better than @xmath5% in @xmath6 and @xmath7% in the colors @xcite , and a factor of @xmath5 improvement has been obtained from repeat imaging of the equatorial region @xcite .",
    "finally , the survey is sensitive to the redshift interval that , given a large enough sample , enables cosmological distance measurements with data from a _ single telescope _ , eliminating the need for cross - calibration across two or more photometric systems .",
    "this paper is part of a series describing the  supernova survey . here",
    "we present a technical description of the search algorithm , data processing , photometric typing of  candidates , and spectroscopic target selection .",
    "@xcite presents an overview of the program .",

    "the main body of the paper is separated into two broad sections . the first part (  [ sec : obs ] ) presents the details of the real - time on - mountain data processing and the mechanics of the search pipeline , which identifies new transient events .",
    "the second part (  [ sec : spectro ] ) describes the procedures for supernova candidate identification , photometric  typing , and the algorithm adopted for selecting targets for spectroscopy .",
    "a brief discussion of follow - up imaging observations of a sample of spectroscopically confirmed e  is presented in  [ sec : imaging ] .",
    "the general results from the 2005 and 2006 seasons are presented in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we briefly summarize in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the  supernova survey has been allocated the bulk of the time during the fall seasons ( september 1 - november 30 ) of 2005  2007 on the  telescope at apache point observatory ( ) .",
    "imaging observations are scheduled on most nights excluding a 5-day period around full moon .",
    "some nights are shared with the segue program especially during stretches of consecutive nights with good observing conditions .",
    "an overview of the  is given by @xcite ; see @xcite for an overview of the  survey .",
    "the survey area is stripe 82 , the 300  deg@xmath0 southern equatorial stripe of the  footprint , which covers the approximate coordinate ranges @xmath8 ( 20  hrs to 4  hrs in right ascension ,  or @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 in declination ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the detailed stripe 82 footprint of each camera column is shown in table  [ tbl : stripe82 ] .",
    "this survey area was selected for three primary reasons : ( 1 ) extensive repeat observations were acquired as part of the  survey , before the start of the  survey , ( 2 ) the area is easily accessible to most telescopes , and ( 3 ) it is accessible at low airmass during the fall months , when most of the northern  area is not .",
    "the advantages of having repeat observations from  are three - fold .",
    "first , the data provide a catalog of known variable sources , which is crucial for distinguishing a small number of new  candidates from a large population of foreground variable stars and background active galactic nuclei .",
    "second , the deep coadded images constructed from the individual scans serve as references for image subtraction , enabling a more sensitive search of new transient events ( the template is essentially noiseless in the detection process ) . finally , the deep coadds also allow identification of faint host galaxies that are otherwise undetected in the single - scan images , which are frequently useful for prioritizing follow - up observations .",
    "the stripe contains over 3 million cataloged galaxies that are brighter than @xmath12  mag .        due to gaps between the six  columns ,",
    "the  imaging camera is capable of scanning approximately half of the stripe ( or one strip ) in a single night . during the 2005 season",
    ", the observations alternated between the northern strip ( 82n ) and the southern strip ( 82s ) from night to night . in 2006 , however , a significant effort was made to avoid long temporal gaps in any given part of the strip , so pieces of  ranges from both strips were sometimes observed in a single night .",
    "we also note that approximately 10% of stripe 82 is covered by both the northern and southern strips due to overlapping  columns , so @xmath13  deg@xmath0 of the sky is observed on a cadence of 1 day ( modulo weather losses ) .",
    "the lists of all  runs , i.e. , continuous imaging scans , and their corresponding  ranges taken during the 2005 and 2006 seasons are given in table  [ tbl : runs2005 ] and table  [ tbl : runs2006 ] , respectively .",
    "we also show in figure  [ fig : runarea ] the number of visits made to each of the strips in 2005 and 2006 as a function of the .",
    "the complete set of corrected frames and the uncalibrated object catalogs from 2005 and 2006 are available online as part of the first  data release ( drsn1 ) .",
    "these data are also accessible from the data archive server of the sixth data release @xcite .",
    "the  2.5 m telescope nominally performs observations every night during the search seasons , so the data must be processed within 24  hours to avoid a backlog of unprocessed data and to rapidly identify  candidates for spectroscopic follow - up observations .",
    "a single night of observing produces up to @xmath14  gb of imaging data , so it is highly desirable to process the data on the mountain and significantly reduce the number of images that are transferred over the internet for visual inspection .",
    "the data are processed on a dedicated 10 dual - processor ( 20 processors total ) computer cluster that runs at .",
    "there are nine computers that process data ; each of the 18 processors is responsible for processing all images from a single combination of filter ( _ gri _ ) and camera column ( 1  6 ) .",
    "each computer has 400  gb of 5 disk and 2  gb memory .",
    "the 10th monitor / backup computer has 3  tb of disk and 4  gb memory and is used for process - management , data transfer , and software development .",
    "this setup was specifically chosen to meet our requirement of processing a full night s worth of data within 24  hours .",
    "an 11th computer is available as a spare but so far has not been needed  during the first two years of operation , there were no serious failures .",
    "several disks failed , but the  system worked properly to prevent any loss of processing time while waiting for a disk to be replaced .",
    "there was one curious glitch that may be related to operation at high altitude ( 2800  m ) . on occasion one of the computers",
    "would hang up , and cycling the power was the only way to revive the system .",
    "there were about 20 such incidents per season , although the probability seemed higher in the month of november , possibly due to better weather and longer nights resulting in more computing time .",
    "since people are present at  day and night , minimal processing time was lost from these hang - ups .",
    "there are three main tasks for the process manager : ( i ) start jobs , ( ii ) monitor processing progress , and ( iii ) monitor disk space . due to the structure of the data acquisition system , the image processing can start only after an imaging run has finished , and the master script is usually executed manually by a person in the morning . while this script could have been automatically started , it is better that a human reviews the observer logs and checks that processing starts smoothly .",
    "the master script schedules and allocates resources for copying data from the data acquisition computer to a local disk , photometric reduction in @xmath4 (   [ subsub : photo ] ) , and frame subtraction (   [ subsub : framesub ] ) and object detection (   [ subsub : doobjects ] ) in @xmath15 .",
    "several monitor scripts are used to check the status throughout the @xmath16  hours needed to process the data . since data processing continues virtually round - the - clock , a few people often shared the monitoring burden .",
    "continuous monitoring was necessary because there were two common problems that could interupt the processing .",
    "first , poor observing conditions caused the photometric reduction software to abort . in this case",
    ", the photometric reduction must be reprocessed with a more restrictive  range .",
    "the second source of interruption was the computer hang - ups discussed above .",
    "the last process - manager issue concerns disk space . rather than clearing disk space after each night s data have been processed , we kept all of the subtracted images at  for 12 weeks .",
    "the reason for keeping subtracted images is that for interesting candidates we could go back to earlier epochs and process @xmath17 and @xmath1 : @xmath17 band was particularly useful to distinguish type ia and type ii supernovae .",
    "in addition , since the candidate position is known , we re - ran @xmath15 photometry at the known location in previous epochs to get a better estimate of the early - epoch fluxes and upper limits .",
    "the disk space was managed with a priority system so that clearing disk was mostly based on following a pre - defined algorithm and rarely involved a hasty decision . to avoid risks with automated disk - cleaning , a human - entered command was required .",
    "below we describe the search pipeline and the reduction procedures adopted to take the raw images to the point where they are transferred to the central  database server at fermilab .",
    "the raw data are first processed through the  pipeline @xcite .",
    "the software produces the corrected frames and generates bad - pixel maps , position - dependent , and astrometric solution @xcite that are used in subsequent processing stages .",
    "our version of  does not identify sources in the images or perform photometric measurements @xcite , as they are not appropriate for efficiently identifying  candidates , which are usually blended with their host galaxies .",
    "as with all standard  data , images from each camera column are written in frames of @xmath18 unique pixels or 13.51  @xmath19  on the sky . the pipeline software was slightly tweaked to run on data taken under poor observing conditions ( bright moon , low atmospheric transparency , and poor seeing ) . in 2005 and 2006 , approximately 34% and 30% , respectively , of the frames were acquired when the moon was above the horizon .",
    "figure  [ fig : seeing ] shows the distributions of the @xmath6-band  of frames successfully processed through  during the first two seasons .",
    "-band  during the 2005 ( black ) and 2006 ( red ) search seasons .",
    "more than half of the frames were acquired at @xmath20 .",
    "only frames successfully processed through  are included . ]      to identify new transients in the search data , the images are run through a difference imaging pipeline , which matches the  of the search and template frames , adjusts for the difference in photometric zeropoint , accurately registers their pixels , and performs the subtraction .",
    "the image templates were divided into four separate  ranges so that human scanning and target selection could begin well before the entire night of data was finished processing .",
    "the subtracted frames in each filter are searched for positive fluctuations that consist of at least 2 contiguous pixels each above @xmath21 of the noise .",
    "the software is derived from version 7.1 of the photpipe software used by the supermacho and collaborations @xcite .",
    "extensive changes have been implemented to operate successfully on processed  data .",
    "the modified application is called framesub .",
    "the pipeline is operated in three modes : 1 ) sdssred mode , where the input of images is prepared for difference imaging .",
    "2 ) sdssdiff , which performs a difference imaging analysis of the search data compared to the template data .",
    "to conserve computing time , only the _ gri _  frames are differenced and used for object detection .",
    "this is the default mode that produces the objects for manual inspection , and subsequently the candidates described below .",
    "3 ) sdssforce mode , in which , after reliable detection of a supernova candidate , we difference _ all _ data on the object , including the @xmath17 and @xmath1 bands , and perform forced - positional photometry at the location of the candidate .",
    "the measurements of magnitudes by sdssdiff and sdssforce are referred to as _ search _ and _ forced _ photometry .",
    "the overall structure of the software and detailed descriptions of each mode are provided in appendix  [ app : software ] .",
    "the individual peaks found by framesub are filtered through a software called doobjects to remove statistical fluctuations and identify true astronomical sources .",
    "first , the single - filter peaks are matched by position to identify sources that are detected in at least two of the three _ gri _  filters within @xmath22 .",
    "these sources are flagged as _",
    "objects_. significant negative fluctuations are not flagged .",
    "the list of objects is compared against the list of known variable sources ( the veto catalog ) constructed from previous scans of stripe 82 .",
    "any object that matches the position of a known variable is filtered out .",
    "most of the sources in this catalog are variable stars , active galactic nuclei ( ) , and other persistently varying sources .",
    "approximately 10% ( 20% ) of the objects identified by doobjects in 2005 ( 2006 ) were associated with sources in the veto catalog .",
    "given the large area covered by the survey and the overlap of the central  range of stripe  82 with the ecliptic plane , our detections are overwhelmingly dominated by solar system objects .",
    "the challenge is to remove as many of these objects as possible prior to handscanning , without filtering out real  candidates .",
    "objects with proper motions in excess of @xmath23  per minute are easily rejected by requiring that the object is detected in the @xmath6 and @xmath24 bands within @xmath22  ( the filters are imaged in the order @xmath25 and the effective time difference between adjacent filters is 71.7 seconds ) .",
    "objects that move as slowly as @xmath26  per minute can be identified through motion between the @xmath27 and @xmath6 bands .",
    "objects that move at a slower rate are slightly more difficult to identify ; when they pass in front of a background galaxy , they can look like perfectly good  candidates .",
    "approximately 35% ( 40% ) of the objects found in 2005 ( 2006 ) were tagged as moving objects and removed prior to human evaluation .",
    "new transient sources are entered into a dedicated mysql database and the cutout images are transferred to fermilab for visual inspection .",
    "in addition to epochs of  light - curves , the difference imaging and object detection algorithms described above result in the detection of many background sources of variation , both physical and non - physical . in order to robustly reject background and allow us to focus further analysis on promising  candidates , we require that a human visually inspect images of the objects , a process which we refer to as _ handscanning_.    in addition to moving solar system objects , other major sources of contamination include artifacts caused by ( 1 ) subtraction of slightly misaligned images , which creates shapes with clusters of positive and negative counts ( objects that we call dipoles ) in the differenced images , ( 2 ) diffraction spikes , and ( 3 ) bright saturated stars .",
    "satellite trails that are not properly masked by the software also contribute to the background .",
    "a small fraction of the dipoles are high proper - motion stars that have drifted between the epochs of the template and search images .",
    "many of these background objects , however , can be quickly rejected by visual inspection . in figure",
    "[ fig : object_mosaic ] , we show a gallery of cutout search , template , and differenced images of various types of objects evaluated by scanners  none , artifact , dipole , variable , transient ,  gold ,  bronze , and  other .",
    "all images shown are from the @xmath6 band . in figure",
    "[ fig : object_moving ] , we show _ gri _  images of a moving object correctly flagged by the software .",
    "these images show the source moved between the @xmath27 and @xmath6 exposures , which are separated by about 5 minutes .    as a convenient way for humans to handscan the detected objects",
    ", a web interface was constructed that queries the database and displays all of the relevant information about the object , including _",
    "cutout images of the search , template , and differenced images , measured magnitudes , the mean sky coordinates and the relative positions measured in each filter , and a list of all previous detections ( if any ) within 0.8@xmath28 of the object under inspection .",
    "the scanner evaluates the information and decides to either tag the object as a possible  or to reject it as background .",
    "if an object is tagged as a  and there are no previous detections of objects within 0.8@xmath28 , it becomes a new  _ candidate _ with a unique  i d number .",
    "a candidate will always remain a candidate unless it is manually vetoed by one of the scanners ( which rarely occurs ) .",

    "objects classified as `` none '' are typically detections near the threshold , and are often not visible to the human eye .",
    "most `` artifacts '' are caused by different orientations of diffraction spikes in the search and template images .",
    "a `` dipole '' results from imperfect image registration as well as high proper - motion stars .",
    "a `` variable '' is an object associated with a persistent source and usually exhibits random temporal variability .",
    "these sources are newly variable sources that are not part of the veto catalog .",
    "a `` transient '' object is usually seen for the first time and _ not _ associated with a galaxy .",
    "the source can be a true  with an undetected host galaxy or a slow - moving asteroid .",
    "an ``  gold '' is a good  candidate that is well - separated from the host .",
    "an ``  bronze '' is a possible  that lies close to the core of the galaxy and can , therefore , also be a variable active galactic nucleus .",

    "in addition to the @xmath6-band images ( top row ) , we also display the @xmath27 ( middle row ) and @xmath24-band ( bottom row ) images to show the relative position of the source in each filter .",
    "note that the faint source in the @xmath27-band differenced image appears slightly below and to the left of the center of the image .",
    "the images are acquired in the order @xmath29 with a 71.7-second delay between each filter.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    during the 2005 observing season , we required that every object that is not rejected by doobjects be handscanned by a human .",
    "an average of about 3000  5000 objects were inspected per full night of imaging during the fall 2005 season .",
    "six scanners were on duty on a given night , each scanner responsible for inspecting all objects from one of the six camera columns , or 500  800 objects .",
    "based on our experience in 2005 , we made a number of changes to the handscanning procedure for the 2006 season described below .      to reduce the number of objects to be scanned by humans , prior to the 2006 season we implemented a new software filter , called the _",
    "autoscanner_. the software performs two primary tasks : 1 ) identifies all objects detected in more than one epoch as well as bright ( @xmath27 or @xmath30  mag ) objects detected for the first time , and 2 ) uses statistical classification techniques to identify and filter out first - epoch background non- objects .",
    "the reasons for performing 1 ) are as follows .",
    "first , the selection of objects detected in more than one epoch provides a very robust way of eliminating moving objects , one of the major contaminants of the 2005 candidates .",
    "second , the selection of bright first - epoch objects enables us to discover nearby e ; we can thereby obtain spectroscopic observations well before maximum light and provide rapid alerts to the  community .",
    "in addition , bright , single - epoch candidates provide a back - up list of spectroscopic targets for nights when the spectroscopy queue is not filled by promising multi - epoch candidates . although most of our targets were spectroscopically observed after two or more epochs of photometry , in a few instances , we did obtain spectroscopic observations of  candidates based on a single epoch of detection . in the selection of these objects",
    ", the autoscanner also identifies objects associated with either a known variable in the veto catalog or a known  candidate . in the former case ,",
    "the object is filtered out . in the latter case , since there is no need for a human to scan the object , it is instead flagged by the autoscanner as a known  candidate , stored in the database , and used in the light curve analysis ( see section  [ subsec : snphoto ] ) .    for 2 ) , the autoscanner attempts to identify and filter out bright first - epoch objects that belong to one of three classes of background ; unmasked diffraction spikes , artifacts of imperfect image registration ( dipoles ) , and moving objects .",
    "the software treats the set of objects , along with their evaluations by a human , from the 2005 search as a training set , and compares the observed quantities for newly detected objects against this set .",
    "the method used to classify an object is the _ histogram method of probability density function ( ) estimation_. in this method the observable quantities , or attributes , of an object form a multi - dimensional space , and a classification decision is made by considering the number count of objects , in the training set , from each class in a bin centered at the point describing the object we wish to classify .",
    "this method has the advantages of being non - parametric , allowing the decision boundaries in the observable space to be arbitrarily complicated , and of explicitly retaining the correlations between observables .",
    "a caveat of using the histogram method of  estimation is that one must have a sufficient number of objects in the training set to sample the  well in all regions of interest . with @xmath31 objects in the training set ,",
    "this is not a significant limitation for the  survey .",
    "a technical discussion of the algorithm is presented in appendix  [ app : autoscanner ] .    during the 2006 observing season",
    ", the autoscanner was used to reject moving objects from among the set of bright first - epoch objects that were to be handscanned . for such bright objects ,",
    "only @xmath32% of them are incorrectly tagged as moving objects by the autoscanner .",
    "in contrast to the 2005 observing season , we chose not to handscan epochs of known candidates or objects that showed variation in more than one observing season , and the autoscanner was used to reject such objects .",
    "although some objects were classified as artifacts or dipoles , we chose not to reject these from the handscanning as they are a small fraction of the background in comparison to moving objects , and the relatively small reduction in handscanning that would be accomplished was determined to be outweighed by the risk of missing an early epoch of a nearby .",
    "this new handscanning strategy and the autoscanner enabled a reduction in the number of objects scanned by more than an order of magnitude between 2005 and 2006 , with no reduction in the quality or quantity of confirmed e. while scanning a single camera column in 2005 typically took @xmath33  hours per person for a full night of data , in 2006 a scanner could cover two columns in only @xmath34  minutes .",
    "the reduction of the 2006 handscanning by the autoscanner is summarized in table  [ tbl : scanning ] .",
    "a comparison of the objects classified by the autoscanner as artifacts to their human classification shows that the autoscanner is extremely efficient at recognizing artifacts , and that our concern about potentially rejecting nearby e  was overly cautious . during the 2006 observing campaign ,",
    "3753 objects had been classified by the autoscanner as artifacts .",
    "humans classified 2668 of these objects as artifacts and 3710 of them as some type of non-  background .",
    "of the remaining 43 objects classified by a humans as  candidates , 41 were background ( non- ) erroneously classified by the scanner , one was a bright nova outburst , and one was the first epoch of a  that was later ( after the 2nd epoch detection ) classified as a .",
    "therefore , in cases where they disagree on classification of artifacts , the autoscanner appears to be more reliable than the human scanners .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up is an essential component of any current supernova survey , for both confirming the type of the  candidate and measuring the cosmological redshift ( preferably from host galaxy emission / absorption lines ) . for the  survey , the amount of scheduled spectroscopic telescope time is larger than the amount of imaging time on the  2.5 m telescope by a large factor ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the telescopes used for spectroscopy in 2005 and 2006 included the 9.2 m , 3.6 m , 3.5 m , 8.2 m subaru , 2.4 m  hiltner , 4.2 m , 4 m  mayall , 10 m keck , 2.5 m , and the 11 m .",
    "on any given night during the fall season , there could be several telescopes that are simultaneously scheduled and observing a set of our candidates .",
    "this requires a significant amount of coordination between the various observers at each of the telescopes to avoid observing the same candidate .",
    "a single person ( the first author of this paper ) was responsible for coordinating all follow - up imaging and spectroscopic observations in 2005 and 2006 .",
    "telescopes separated by several time zones are relatively easy to coordinate , but those that have similar longitudes ( e.g. , , , ) require real - time communication . in general , the brighter targets are parsed to telescopes with smaller aperture , but the magnitude limits must be adjusted depending on the observing conditions at each site .",
    "we have made every effort to avoid taking duplicate spectra , but on occasion the same object was observed nearly simultaneously on two telescopes .",
    "a good night of imaging of half of stripe 82 typically yields @xmath35 objects that are tagged as _ new _",
    "candidates , which are publicly accessible through the web immediately after they are entered into the database .",
    "this number significantly exceeds the number of targets we can observe spectroscopically , and choices must be made .",
    "the following subsections describe the further prioritization of  targets for spectroscopic observations .",
    "the algorithm and strategy depends on the amount of resources available , which is something that evolved quite substantially between the 2005 and 2006 search seasons .",
    "after each night of imaging on the  2.5 m telescope , the _ gri _  light curves of all active candidates are compared against a library of light curve templates of different  types .",
    "the purpose of this procedure is twofold ",
    "1 ) to quickly identify the best - matching template and provide estimates of the redshift , extinction , the approximate date of maximum light , and current apparent magnitudes , and 2 ) to compute other quantities that are useful for prioritizing follow - up spectroscopy , such as the amount of host galaxy contamination .",
    "the process is essential since the number of active  candidates ( a good fraction of which are not e ) at any given time exceeds the number that can be observed spectroscopically by a large factor .",
    "a reliable system is necessary to make efficient use of the valuable spectroscopic resources .",
    "several techniques and algorithms for  photometric identification have been introduced previously by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the method adopted here is most similar to that used by the  spectroscopic follow up described in @xcite .",
    "below , we describe the details of the algorithm .    the measured light curves are compared against a library of light curve templates , which are grouped into three types  a , b / c , and  and are generated from multi - epoch spectra constructed and compiled by p. nugent and also from the database .",
    "specifically , for the type ia , we use nugent s branch - normal , 1991t - like , and 1991bg - like templates .",
    "the branch - normal spectra are used for computing synthetic light curves of ea  with a range of luminosities parameterized by the decline rate .",
    "the model is described in appendix  [ app : snia_lc ] .",
    "the set of templates used for the type ib / c are nugent s normal and hypernova ib / c spectra , as well as spectra and light curves of 1999ex and 2002ap from the  database .",
    "similarly , we use nugent s ii - p , ii - l , and iin spectra , and s 1993j ( iib ) , 1998s ( iin ) , and 1999em ( ii - p ) to generate a set of type ii light curves .    the light curves in the observed _ ugriz _  filters are calculated on a grid of four parameters ( @xmath1 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , [ @xmath38 , template ] ) , where @xmath1 is the redshift , @xmath36 is the host galaxy extinction in the @xmath39 band and assumes @xmath40 , and @xmath37 is the time of rest - frame @xmath41-band maximum light .",
    "the last parameter refers to either the decline rate parameter for the branch - normal ia models ( @xmath38 ) , or the particular  template for the peculiar ea  ( 1991t - like and 1991bg - like ) and the core - collapse models .",
    "we do not attempt to fit or correct for the milky way extinction . in this procedure , we _ assume _ a cosmology to convert the redshift to a luminosity distance , similar to the method adopted by the  described in @xcite .",
    "the adopted cosmological parameters are @xmath42 and @xmath43 . for the a  templates",
    ", we also assume a fiducial peak @xmath41-band absolute magnitude of @xmath44  mag , where @xmath45 is the hubble constant in units of km / s / mpc , for a standard @xmath38= 1.1 a. as shown by @xcite , a particular set of assumed cosmological parameters in the computation of the model light curves does not significantly bias the population of targets for spectroscopic observations . at low redshift ( @xmath46 ) , the luminosity distances are not sensitive to our choice of @xmath47 and @xmath48 . above @xmath49 , the statistical uncertainties in the fluxes and the combination of varying @xmath1 and @xmath36 can compensate for differences in luminosity distance that might result from a different set of cosmological parameters .",
    "the assumption , however , could systematically bias the estimated photometric redshifts , but that is not a concern for the purposes of target selection .    the templates are grouped into three  types  ia , ibc , and ii  and the fitter records the best - fit parameters and the minimum value of the @xmath50 statistic on the four - dimensional parameter grid within each of the three types .",
    "in addition to identifying the  type with the lowest @xmath50 value , which we refer to as `` type - best '' , we examine the relative values of the @xmath50 and determine whether the  candidate should be considered as `` typed '' according to one or both of the following two criteria . if we denote the value of the @xmath50 of the best - matching type by @xmath51 , the next best type as @xmath52 , and the worst one as @xmath53 ( i.e. , @xmath54 ) , the `` a '' criterion is satisfied if @xmath55 .",
    "if `` type - best '' is a ia _ and _ satisfies the above criterion , the candidate is said to have a `` type - a of ia '' .",

    "the @xmath17-band photometry is sometimes useful for distinguishing ea  from core - collapse e  that are generally bluer ( @xmath70 ) during the early phases after explosion .",
    "after the  photometric typing process , the software computes three quantities that help prioritize the target list for spectroscopic observations .",
    "these quantities are referred to as `` weights '' and they are constructed specifically to identify candidates that are 1 ) near or before peak brightness , 2 ) less contaminated by galaxy light , and 3 ) not heavily extincted by intervening dust .",

    "the decline - rate parameter @xmath38  and redshift @xmath1 are also adopted from the best - fit values obtained from the light curve fits .",
    "if the best - fit type is a core - collapse , @xmath38  is set to unity .",

    "clearly , candidates with larger values of @xmath85 suffer less contamination from the host galaxy light .",
    "the third and final weight is the `` dust weight '' , which estimates the amount of dust extinction from both host galaxy morphology and color , and is defined to be , @xmath86 the quantity @xmath87 is the fractional probability of the source being well represented by a de vaucouleurs profile and is again computed from values in the  catalog , i.e. , @xmath88 where dev_l , exp_l , star_l are the null hypothesis probabilities of the object being well - represented by a de vaucouleurs profile , an exponential function , and a stellar profile ( ) , respectively .",

    "manual screening and selection of the sources by the spectroscopic coordinator is still required .",
    "we describe our strategy in detail below .",
    "spectra are obtained by the various spectroscopic teams , who independently apply for observing time during each of the search seasons .",
    "the teams agreed to confirm types and obtain redshifts of a  candidates at the highest priority , but each team generally has one or more of their own  projects that they pursue in parallel .",
    "some of these include 1 ) multi - epoch spectroscopy of peculiar e , 2 ) e  in underluminous host galaxies , 3 ) b / c  and hypernova candidates , 4 ) detailed spectroscopic properties of a  hosts , and 5 ) multi - epoch studies of line features and their diversity in ea .",
    "whenever possible , we also try to obtain spectra of other variable objects if a scanner has classified them as `` interesting '' .",
    "an example of this is a dwarf nova discovered in aquarius @xcite .    in 2005 ,",
    "the primary telescopes used for observing the low - redshift candidates were the  3.5 m ,  4.2 m and the  2.4 m telescopes .",
    "the high - z candidates were observed with either the  or subaru .",
    "the resources were sufficient to obtain spectra of most @xmath95 a candidates as well as core - collapse e  at @xmath96 , but only a fraction of the @xmath97 candidates were observed .    during the fall 2006 campaign ,",
    "the various spectroscopic teams were awarded sufficient 3m - class telescope time to obtain a spectrum of essentially _ all _  candidates with @xmath98  mag ( an average a  at @xmath99 and core - collapse  at @xmath96 near maximum light ) _ and _ obtain multi - epoch spectra of a large sample of nearby ( @xmath100 ) ea .",
    "we generally require at least two epochs of detection before we target the candidate for spectroscopic observation , to guarantee that the source is not an asteroid .",
    "this also enables a better estimate of the epoch of peak brightness of the .",
    "since the primary goal of our survey is to obtain well - sampled light curves of type ia e ,  ia candidates that are discovered early are generally given higher priority for spectroscopy .",
    "this is especially true for the very low-@xmath1 candidates ( @xmath100 ) to enable rapid confirmation and dissemination to the public .    in practice",
    ", we initially select a  candidates that satisfy at least one of the `` a '' or `` b '' criteria either with or without a galaxy photometric redshift prior .",
    "there are times , however , during stretches of poor weather at  and/or when several 3m - class spectroscopic telescopes are online , when there are not enough new and bright a  candidates to observe .",
    "this was not an issue during most of the 2005 season , but it occurred frequently in 2006 . in such cases , we loosen the selection criteria and inspect all currently - bright sources irrespective of their best - fit  type ; there is only small number ( @xmath101 ) of sources with @xmath98  mag at any given time .",
    "when necessary , we also target candidates that have only a single epoch of detection .",
    "extremely red single - epoch targets that are not associated with a host galaxy are generally avoided ( to minimize the chance of observing an asteroid ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "there is never a shortage of higher-@xmath1 a  targets at @xmath102 , so the `` a '' or `` b '' criterion with or without a galaxy photometric redshift prior is always used in the pre - selection process . at these redshifts ,",
    "we generally avoid candidates that are located within @xmath103  of the centroid of a host galaxy , since they have a relatively higher chance of being an active galactic nucleus .",
    "candidates at @xmath104 that are well - separated from the host and suffer a relatively low level of extinction ( as estimated from the multi - band light curve fits ) are high - priority ( priority 0 and 1 ) targets for , which is a queue - scheduled telescope @xcite .",
    "lower-@xmath1 candidates ( @xmath105 ) are assigned lower  priority ( mostly priority 2 , but some at priority 3 ) .",

    "the subaru telescope has focused on a  candidates in a similar redshift range , but , to take advantage of its superb image quality , the subaru telescope has generally been assigned targets that suffer a relatively large amount of host contamination ( i.e. , a low value of @xmath85 ; see section  [ subsec : observability ] ) .",
    "the spectra are often analyzed in real time by the observers on site , and feedback is given to the spectroscopic coordinator .",
    "depending on the observing conditions , the target list is adjusted in real time . at the end of the night ,",
    "the observers provide a preliminary spectroscopic type of each of the candidates observed .",

    "this mode yields more accurate measurements of the fluxes than those produced by sdssdiff , and they generally agree with the final photometry to within @xmath123  mag in all filters @xcite .",
    "as a further illustration of the histogram method of  estimation , we note that bayes theorem , applied to classification , says that , @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the conditional probability for @xmath126 given @xmath127 , @xmath128 represents object class @xmath24 , and @xmath75 denote particular values for the set of observables of an object .",

    "the motivation for this criterion is that we are searching for an _ overdensity _ of objects of class @xmath24 in the region of observable space in question . in practice",
    "the threshold is a free parameter that can be adjusted to control the relative level of accepted signal to background events .    in this experiment ,",
    "background events dominate over e  epochs by a large factor , and a bayesian classifier would reject  epochs that lie in a reasonable region of the observable space if the region overlaps with background events , even far away from the peak of the background distribution . a cartoon of the situation is shown in figure  [ fig : cartoon ] . thus , the autoscanner can also be regarded as a bayesian classifier where the thresholds are adjusted _ a priori _ to mitigate false negatives , at the cost of more background in the scanning .",
    "[ t ]        the training set for the autoscanner consists of all objects from the 2005 observing season that were ranked by a human as an artifact , a dipole , a moving object , or a .",
    "this set is comprised of 91220 total objects , of which 65576 are a sub - class of background , and 25644 are objects ranked as a .",
    "the quantities used for classification of artifacts are , a measure of the objects ellipticity , the signal - to - noise ratio and the value of the reduced @xmath134 when fitting the object to a model of the . in computing the @xmath50 ,",
    "we do not account for possible error in the model and so objects with large signal - to - noise values also have large @xmath135 values .",
    "therefore , in classifying artifacts it is important to retain the correlation between @xmath135 and signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the quantities used for classifying dipoles are the measured flux in negative valued pixels , and the ratio of measured flux in negative valued pixels to the flux in positive valued pixels .",
    "the quantities used for classifying moving objects are the measured magnitudes , the magnitude of the apparent motion between different filters , and an angle describing the apparent motion between filters . if the object has a detection in the 3 filter - bands @xmath15 , then the angle is the angle between the `` vector '' that describes the apparent motion between the @xmath6 and @xmath24 filters , and the `` vector '' that describes the apparent motion between the @xmath24 and @xmath27 filters .",
    "if the object is truly moving then these apparent motions should be nearly co - linear .",
    "if the object is only detected in 2 of the @xmath15 filters then the angle is the angle between the apparent motion between the 2 filters and the `` unit vector '' aligned in the direction of increasing right - ascension .",

    "<S> the sloan digital sky survey - ii supernova survey has identified a large number of new transient sources in a 300  deg@xmath0 region along the celestial equator during its first two seasons of a three - season campaign . </S>",
    "<S> multi - band ( _ ugriz _ ) light curves were measured for most of the sources , which include solar system objects , galactic variable stars , active galactic nuclei , supernovae ( e ) , and other astronomical transients . </S>",
    "<S> the imaging survey is augmented by an extensive spectroscopic follow - up program to identify e , measure their redshifts , and study the physical conditions of the explosions and their environment through spectroscopic diagnostics . during the survey , </S>",
    "<S> light curves are rapidly evaluated to provide an initial photometric type of the e , and a selected sample of sources are targeted for spectroscopic observations . in the first two seasons , 476 sources were selected for spectroscopic observations , of which 403 were identified as e. for the type ia e , the main driver for the survey , our photometric typing and targeting efficiency is 90% . </S>",
    "<S> only 6% of the photometric a  candidates were spectroscopically classified as non - a  instead , and the remaining 4% resulted in low signal - to - noise , unclassified spectra . </S>",
    "<S> this paper describes the search algorithm and the software , and the real - time processing of the  imaging data . </S>",
    "<S> we also present the details of the supernova candidate selection procedures and strategies for follow - up spectroscopic and imaging observations of the discovered sources . </S>"
