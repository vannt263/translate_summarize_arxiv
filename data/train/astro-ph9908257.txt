    "scaling relations have been extensively used to measure the evolution of galaxies to redshifts of @xmath10 . however , without mass scales , provided by measurements of rotation curves or line - widths , it is impossible to extract the evolution of galactic @xmath11 ratios from that of the underlying luminosity function .",
    "the explicit use of galaxy masses , in the fundamental plane ( @xcite ) , or the tully - fisher relation ( @xcite ) , makes these scaling relations extremely powerful tools for measuring galaxy evolution .",
    "the fundamental plane ( fp ) is useful for quantifying the luminosity evolution of early - type galaxies in distant clusters .",
    "it is an empirical relation between effective radius , velocity dispersion , and surface brightness , for early - type galaxies . in a study of 10 nearby clusters jrgensen _",
    "( 1996 ) found @xmath12 with an  scatter of @xmath13 in @xmath14 ( a 21% distance uncertainty ) .",
    "the virial theorem and homology imply @xmath15 the implication is that the mass - to - light ratio is a function of structural and kinematical observables ( @xcite ) , such that @xmath16 the scatter in coma of 23% in @xmath17 ( @xcite ) , for a given @xmath18 and @xmath19 , suggests a small scatter in _ age _ for a given @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has been postulated that systematic departures from homology exist along the fundamental plane ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , but no satisfactory model has been created to explain both the slope , and the low scatter of the scaling relation .",
    "evolution of the fundamental plane zero - point , slope , and scatter can provide critical insight into the evolution of stellar populations of early - type galaxies and may shed light on the origin of the fundamental plane itself .",
    "in a pioneering effort , franx ( 1995 ) used fundamental plane observations in a665 ( @xmath20 ) to detect the evolution of stellar populations in early - type galaxies .",
    "van dokkum & franx ( 1996 ) continued this technique with early - type galaxies in cl0024 + 16 ( @xmath21 ) and measured evolution consistent with the passive evolution of stellar populations which formed at very high redshift .",
    "more recently , kelson  ( 1997 ) extended fundamental plane measurements to small samples in cl1358 + 62 at @xmath0 , and ms205304 at @xmath22 .",
    "their results confirmed the evolution in the fundamental plane zero - point with redshift .",
    "van dokkum  ( 1998b ) have now extended fundamental plane measurements to @xmath23 , and have constrained both the formation epoch of early - type galaxies and @xmath24 .",
    "other authors have also used the elliptical galaxy scaling relations to constrain galaxy evolution and cosmology as well ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , also finding that e / s0s in clusters are uniformly old .",
    "both van dokkum & franx ( 1996 ) and kelson  ( 1997 ) suggested that the fp tilt may have evolved between @xmath25 and the present epoch , such that low - mass early - types are younger than their high - mass counterparts .",
    "their data also indicated that the scatter was comparable to the nearby fp ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , their samples were simply not large enough to accurately determine the slope or scatter in the fundamental plane at intermediate redshifts .",
    "kelson  ( 1997 ) also found that the velocity dispersions of two e+a galaxies were low ( @xmath26 km / s ) .",
    "are such low velocity dispersions typical , and are these galaxies rotationally supported , such as would be expected for disk - dominated systems ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) ?    in this paper we describe the data and reduction procedures used to determine the internal kinematics of a large sample of galaxies in the cluster cl1358 + 62 .",
    "the hst data , from which the sample was selected , are described in kelson  ( 1999a ) and van dokkum  ( 1998a ) .",
    "extensive keck spectroscopy has now enabled us to measure velocity dispersions , dispersion profiles , and many absorption line rotation curves , for a homogeneous sample of cluster members . in ",
    "[ selection ] , we report on the sample selection for the spectroscopy . the observations and data reduction procedures are briefly discussed in  [ data ] . the stellar templates are prepared in  [ prep ] . our method for deriving velocity dispersions using a direct fitting method is introduced in  [ disp ] . in ",
    "[ compare ] , we test the results against other velocity dispersion routines . in  [ select ] , we discuss the strategy for selecting the best template and investigate the magnitude of template mismatch . in  [ final ] , we discuss the aperture corrections required to place our velocity dispersions on the same system as the jrgensen  ( 1996 ) database , and use the spatially resolved kinematics to compare the cl1358 + 62 members with nearby early - type galaxies .",
    "lastly , sources of error , both random and systematic , are discussed in  [ errors ] .",
    "we are currently studying , in detail , the galaxy populations of three clusters , cl1358 + 62 ( @xmath0 ) , ms205304 ( @xmath22 ) , and ms105403 ( @xmath23 ) , selected from the einstein medium sensitivity survey ( @xcite ) . determining membership is critical for studying any cluster population .",
    "fabricant  ( 1991 ) and fisher  ( 1998 ) have recently collected several hundred redshifts in a @xmath27 field around cl1358 + 62 ; the fisher  ( 1998 ) sample is more than 80% complete at @xmath28 mag .",
    "this field was targeted for extensive imaging with the hst wfpc2 .",
    "a two - color mosaic of the cluster cl1358 + 62 covering @xmath29 was constructed using 12 pointings . of the fisher  ( 1998 ) database , 194 spectroscopically",
    "confirmed cluster members fall within the field of view of the hst imaging . from this large catalog , we selected a sample for detailed study with the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; @xcite ) at the w.m .",
    "keck observatory .",
    "the high resolution of the hst imaging allows us to derive structural parameters with the accuracy needed for the fundamental plane ( @xcite ) .    from the catalog of cluster members within the hst mosaic , we randomly selected galaxies down to @xmath30 mag .",
    "as is discussed in more detail in kelson  ( 1999a ) , the @xmath31-band selected sample contains mostly early - type systems , ranging from ellipticals to early - type spirals .",
    "our sample was constructed without regard for morphological information , contrary to most low redshift samples .",
    "the selection was performed with an effort to efficiently construct multi - slit plates for lris .",
    "we used three masks , with different position angles on the sky . during the designing of the multi - slit masks",
    ", we utilized the apparent morphologies of several galaxies for major - axis positioning , without impacting the selection criteria .",
    "the three mask designs overlap in the core of the cluster , and so the sample is concentrated towards the cluster center .",
    "a total of 67 slitlets were allocated for the three masks .    in figure [ cmd ]",
    ", we show the color - magnitude diagram for the spectroscopically confirmed cluster members within the hst mosaic . at the redshift of the cluster , @xmath32 corresponds to @xmath33 mag ( adopting the @xmath17 evolution as measured by @xcite ) .",
    "there is clearly a tight color - magnitude relation in the cluster , as shown by van dokkum  ( 1998a ) .",
    "the entire catalog of spectroscopically confirmed cluster members within the hst mosaic is shown by the circles , and those selected for fundamental plane analysis are shown by the filled circles . as can be seen in the figure",
    ", the fundamental plane sample fairly represents the cluster population , minus the very bluest and faintest objects ( @xcite ) .",
    "fisher  ( 1998 ) found 108 members brighter than @xmath34 mag within the hst mosaic .",
    "our high - resolution spectroscopic sample contains 52 of them .",
    "since three cluster galaxies fainter than the magnitude limit were added , the total number of the sample presented here is 55 .",
    "two of these galaxies were observed using more than one slit - mask .",
    "eight overlap the sample of kelson  ( 1997 ) .    this high - resolution sample of cluster members contains mostly spectroscopically early - type galaxies , a few e+a galaxies , and a few galaxies fainter than @xmath34 mag .",
    "the e+a galaxies are defined by @xmath35   and [ oii ] 3727   @xmath36 (@xcite ) .",
    "the e+a fraction in our high - resolution spectroscopic sample is consistent with the fraction fisher  ( 1998 ) found for the cluster , about 5% . by estimating the mass scales for these galaxies , we hope to constrain the relationship between the butcher - oemler effect ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) and the histories of `` normal '' cluster members ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "in may 1996 we obtained high @xmath1 two - dimensional spectra in the field of cl1358 + 62 . the data",
    "were acquired at the keck i 10 m telescope on mauna kea using lris with the three multi - slit aperture plates .",
    "the first two were exposed for 8100 s , and the third for 7400 s. we used the 900 mm@xmath4 grating , with a dispersion of approximately 0.85   per pixel .",
    "the restframe coverage was typically 4100 to 5200  .",
    "the seeing was typically 075 to 08 ( fwhm ) .",
    "the slitlet widths were 105 , resulting in a typical resolution of @xmath37   ( 60 ) .",
    "some slitlets were `` tilted '' with respect to the primary axis of the slit - masks , to align them along galaxy major - axes .",
    "these slitlets have broader projected widths , and leading to slightly poorer spectral resolution . the treatment of the resolution is discussed explicitly in  [ prep ] .    for the purposes of efficient and accurate extraction of one- and two - dimensional spectra , a new set of fortran procedures",
    "was created .",
    "these subroutines are collected in a stand - alone package called .",
    "s primary functions are that of flat - fielding , rectifying , and wavelength calibrating two - dimensional multi - slit spectroscopic data . can be used trivially for long - slit reductions as well .",
    "some initial processing is required before execution of .",
    "the over - scan and bias - frame subtraction was done in iraf .",
    "cosmic - rays were rejected using median filtering , with a search algorithm for extended sharp objects .",
    "care was taken to not degrade galaxy , or night sky features in the removal of cosmic - rays .",
    "next , the camera , or `` @xmath38''-distortion was determined by tracing the slit boundaries .",
    "this distortion was removed from the flat - field images and the cosmic - ray cleaned , bias - subtracted data frames .",
    "the next steps involved flat - fielding the data , which requires several stages .",
    "first , the spectral dome - flats were normalized , on a slitlet - by - slitlet basis .",
    "the normalization occurs in both the @xmath39 and the @xmath38 directions and produces two output images : a two - dimensional pixel - to - pixel flat - field , and a one - dimensional column vector which represents the ( multi - slit ) slit function .",
    "after the first pass of the normalization procedures , re - normalized columns are medianed to produce a column vector which is output as the slit function .",
    "the pixel - to - pixel flat - field also contains a map of the fringing .",
    "for the data presented here , however , fringing is negligible .",
    "this processing of the flat - fields requires that the @xmath38-distortion be removed beforehand , so that the individual two - dimensional spectra are aligned with the dispersion axis of the ccd .",
    "the data frames are divided by the pixel - to - pixel flat - fields .",
    "tests using spectra extending to @xmath40   showed that this step can be effective in removing fringing .",
    "next , the one - dimensional slit functions are shifted ( in the @xmath38 direction ) , such that the slit edges match those in the data frames .",
    "these shifts are required if the slit edges in the ccd images of the flat - fields are not registered with the slit edges in the data frames .",
    "finally , the columns in the data frames are divided by the shifted slit functions .",
    "each mask has its own set of flat - fields , in order to best match the spectral coverage of each pixel , and to match the individual slit functions .",
    "the two - dimensional multi - slit images were rectified and wavelength calibrated by  using the night sky lines ( [ o i ] , na i , and oh ) .",
    "a single @xmath41 multi - slit image can be fully rectified , wavelength calibrated , and rebinned , for example , in just a few minutes on a dec alpha processor .",
    "we summarize the procedures below .",
    "the interested reader can find more details in kelson ( 1998 ) .",
    "the technique for rectifying two - dimensional spectra uses fast fourier transforms and efficient cross - correlations to measure the pixel shifts between regions of sky ( or lamp ) lines from image row to image row .",
    "thus , our method does not rely on centering algorithms to fix the positions of _ individual _ lamp , or night sky , emission lines .",
    "the shifts , in pixels , between adjacent ccd rows are measured as a function of wavelength , by performing the cross - correlations in subsections of each spectrum , divided along the dispersion direction .",
    "we fit a two - dimensional polynomial to the shifts as a function of @xmath42 position , and use this polynomial to align all the rows to a common coordinate ( wavelength ) system .",
    "the typical  scatter about the fit for these rectification transformations is a few millipixels , with several tens of millipixels in the worst ( tilted ) cases .",
    "this method for rectifying two - dimensional spectra is extremely accurate and computationally economical due to its maximal use of the available data .    because the rectification aligns all the ccd rows , within a given spectrum , one only needs to determine the wavelength solution for a single row ( or average of several , in order to improve the @xmath1 ) .",
    "s automated wavelength calibration routine can use lris lamp lines , or the night sky emission lines .",
    "the algorithm quickly finds the emission peaks , measures the fwhm of each peak non - parametrically , and defines the center of each line to be the average of the two half - power points .",
    "when calibrating spectra using night - sky emission lines , the algorithm quickly finds an approximate central wavelength using cross - correlations , and then identifies triplets of p1 and p2 oh lines using ratios of spacings between sky lines . after an initial determination of a low - order wavelength solution ,",
    "more lines are identified and used to refine the solution .",
    "we chose to fit a fifth order legendre polynomial for the dispersion solutions .",
    "the  scatter about the fit was typically @xmath43-@xmath44  , though somewhat worse for tilted slitlets due to the increase in the width of the lines .",
    "comparison lamp spectra were used to test the validity of the wavelength solution as derived from the night sky emission .",
    "the sky lines had equivalently low  scatter about the lamp solutions , once the zero - point in the wavelength calibration had been corrected .",
    "we opted for a dispersion solution derived directly from the night sky , using emission lines down to 5224  .",
    "each slitlet was rebinned logarithmically to a common wavelength range , by chaining the rectification transformations and dispersion solutions together .",
    "this step involves a single interpolation in the @xmath39 ( wavelength ) direction .",
    "the output images are extra wide to accommodate the staggering of the slitlets in the dispersion direction , and flux was conserved in the rebinning of each image .",
    "note : the data were rebinned only once in the @xmath38 direction of the ccd and once in the @xmath39 direction .",
    "the exposures were then averaged , weighting inversely by the expected noise , including the noise in the sky and galaxies , as well as the read noise in the amplifier .",
    "background subtraction was carried out in a manner similar to long - slit reductions , in which the sky spectrum at the location of a galaxy is interpolated using the observed sky on either side .",
    "residuals around strong night sky lines , such as 5577  , and 6300  , were interpolated over , though this step was performed largely for cosmetic reasons .",
    "spectra for the galaxies were extracted by summing five ccd rows .",
    "the mean @xmath1 ranges from 10 to 80 per  , with a median of 35 per  .",
    "this high @xmath1 allowed us to sum the image rows directly , rather than optimally , which would complicate the determination of the effective aperture of the extraction .",
    "the spectra themselves are shown in figure [ spectra ] .",
    "the 5 row aperture , @xmath45 , is equivalent to a circular aperture of diameter 123 ( @xcite ) . in an @xmath46 , @xmath47 universe",
    ", this corresponds to a circular aperture of diameter 5.5 kpc ( or equivalently @xmath48 at the distance of coma ) .",
    "slitlets tilted by @xmath49 have an effective aperture 19% larger in diameter .",
    "because these galaxies are at cosmological distances , one must process stellar template spectra with care in order to ensure that they have the the same _ restframe _ instrumental resolution as the galaxy spectra ( @xcite ) .",
    "for nearby galaxies , this is obviously not a problem , as the same instrumental setup can be used to obtain both the stellar and galactic spectra . however , for high-@xmath50 objects , template spectra can not be observed with the same instrumental setup and one must carefully model the resolution of the galaxy spectra .",
    "the stellar spectra must be treated with extra caution as well if their resolution is similar to that in the galaxy spectra ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the spectra of template stars must be convolved by a kernel to match the point - spread function of the galaxy spectra .    using lris during twilight in may and august 1996",
    ", we performed long - slit spectroscopy of several late - type stars ( g and k stars ) , listed in table [ templates ] .",
    "the 1200 mm@xmath4 grating was used , providing spectral coverage from 4000   to 5300  , with a dispersion of approximately 0.64   per pixel .",
    "these resulted in spectra with higher resolution that that of our galaxy spectra ( see  [ galres ] ) .",
    "the telescope was moved in a raster pattern to expose the star across the full width of the slit at several spatial positions .",
    "it is important to fill the width of the slit ( 07 ) , such that the spectral resolution is limited by the slit width , and not by the seeing .",
    "these data were also bias - subtracted , flat - fielded , rectified , and wavelength - calibrated .",
    "the extracted stellar spectra have very high @xmath1 , several hundred per pixel .      the stellar spectra were wavelength calibrated using a sparse sample of comparison lamp lines in the blue ( mostly ar and hg ) .",
    "a dearth of bright lamp lines in the blue led us to test the validity of the dispersion solution when applied to the stellar long - slit spectra .",
    "we performed a cross - correlation of a high resolution solar spectrum , with the twilight and template spectra , over small , 100   bins , to provide an independent check on the wavelength calibration .",
    "there was a high - order systematic trend with wavelength , such that there was a net velocity difference between the red and blue sides of the stellar spectra .",
    "the wavelength calibration derived from the internal lamps was in error , by about @xmath51  peak - to - peak , from blue to red , in the may stellar spectra , and about @xmath52  peak - to - peak in the august stellar spectra  equivalent to a non - linear stretching of about 1 pixel .",
    "this can be attributed to the dearth of available lamp lines in the blue , coupled with centering errors in asymmetric arc profiles , especially in the august lamp data . using this cross - correlation information , we rebinned the raw template spectra to the proper dispersion solution .",
    "we determined the instrumental broadening in our stellar spectra in two complementary ways .",
    "initially , the resolution of these stellar spectra was determined using the widths of the comparison lamp lines . for the may stellar spectra , the @xmath18 widths of these lines",
    "are shown in figure [ arc ] as crosses .",
    "however , the internal lamps in lris do not necessarily illuminate the spectrograph in the same manner as the sky .",
    "thus , we wished to compare the arc line widths with the resolution of the stellar spectra themselves .",
    "we were able to measure the intrinsic broadening in the stellar spectra by comparing them with a high - resolution solar spectrum .    using the fourier fitting method ( @xcite )",
    ", we determined the broadening required to match the high - resolution solar spectrum to the spectrum of the twilight sky .",
    "the typical resolution in the may 1996 stellar spectra was 50 km / s .",
    "these fourier fitting method results are shown as open circles in figure [ arc ] , for direct comparison with the @xmath18 widths of the lamp lines .",
    "the two methods give similar broadening profiles as a function of wavelength .",
    "this comparison gives us confidence that the resolution is well - determined .",
    "we also used the high - resolution solar spectrum to find the instrumental broadening in the stellar spectra themselves and found consistent results , except around the balmer lines , where the solar spectrum is clearly not a good match to the later - type stars .",
    "the august 1996 stellar template spectra were taken after an upgrade of lris , in which a new ccd , field - flattener , and dewar were installed .",
    "the lamp spectra taken at this time have strongly asymmetric profile shapes , probably due to the internal illumination overfilling the grating ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the spectrograph s resolution of the sky ( and galaxies ) may not be well - described by the arc line profiles .",
    "therefore , we used the high resolution solar spectrum again , to directly measure the instrumental broadening in the august stellar spectra .",
    "there was no twilight spectrum from august , but the spectrum of the g5iv template star is close in type to the solar spectrum , thus minimizing any problems with template mismatch in the determination of the resolution . at 4500  , the high - resolution spectrum implies an instrumental broadening in the hd5268 spectrum of 45 , while the lamp line widths yield 55 .    if the resolution derived from the august 1996 arc spectra were to have been adopted instead of that derived from the solar spectrum comparison , we would have incurred a @xmath53 error in velocity dispersion at @xmath54 . at @xmath55 ,",
    "this error is only @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the effect on the slope , @xmath57 , of the fundamental plane , @xmath58 , would have been to increase the coefficient of @xmath59 , by @xmath60 .    for both the may and august stellar spectra , we adopted the resolution determined from the high resolution solar spectrum .",
    "the night sky lines enabled us to measure the variation in instrumental broadening as a function of wavelength , for each of the cl1358 + 62 slitlets .",
    "however , care must be taken since blended sky lines can bias the measurement of the instrumental broadening .",
    "therefore , the spectrograph resolution was measured using a list of bright night - sky lines , chosen such that they are unblended at our resolution .",
    "in particular , we used the emission lines at 5577  , 6300  , 6364  , and an array of oh p1 lines , all of which are listed in table [ linetable ] ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the oh p1 lines are close blended doublets , which , for our instrumental setup , impacts our estimate of the resolution at levels smaller than @xmath61 .",
    "the effect is negligibly small for our velocity dispersion measurements .",
    "we also note that the profiles of these sky lines were well fit by pure gaussians .",
    "the sky line widths vary as a function of wavelength and position across the ccd .",
    "we fit third order polynomials to the sky - line widths as a function of wavelength , for each slitlet .",
    "the variation in template resolution with wavelength was also modeled with a third order polynomial .",
    "the final , prepared template spectra were generated by convolving the stellar spectra using a gaussian with a @xmath18 width determined by the quadrature difference between the two resolution polynomials .",
    "this procedure was tested by measuring the effective resolution of the prepared template spectra using the high - resolution solar spectrum .",
    "the effective resolution of the prepared templates agreed with the sky line widths to within a few percent .",
    "figure [ resolution ] shows sky line widths as a function of wavelength for each of the cl1358 + 62 galaxy slitlets in the second mask .",
    "the circles show the measured widths of the sky lines in , while the solid lines show the polynomial fit to these data .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines show the polynomial representation of the template spectral resolution for the may and august stellar spectra ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , figure [ arc ] ) . the resolution for each slitlet was determined from the combined spectra of three exposures per mask .",
    "the widths of the sky lines were also measured in the three individual exposures separately to test the stability of the resolution .",
    "these individual measurements agree with the data in figure [ resolution ] to a high degree of accuracy ( @xmath62 ) and are therefore not shown .",
    "each slitlet was given its own suite of prepared template spectra , broadened to the have the same restframe resolution as that of the galaxy ( or galaxies ) contained within .",
    "in all cases , the resolution of the template spectra was higher than that for the galaxies .",
    "we are endeavoring to find the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) which gives the best match between our galaxy spectrum and a stellar template broadened by the losvd ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "we have parameterized the losvd by a gaussian , as has been done for comparable studies of nearby samples of early - type galaxies . while sometimes the line profiles of real galaxies can be significantly non - gaussian ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , deviations from gaussian losvds are more typically of the order of 10% ( @xcite ) , and are unimportant for studies of the fundamental plane .",
    "we use two methods to determine the velocity dispersions , the widely used fourier fitting method and a direct fitting method which is more appropriate for high redshift galaxies ( see below ) .",
    "we use both algorithms in order to ensure that our measurements are consistent with those in the nearby samples .",
    "the parameterized losvd , has two parameters , the radial velocity @xmath63 , and the dispersion , @xmath18 , in this velocity .",
    "we therefore build a model , @xmath64 , of each galaxy spectrum , @xmath65 , by a convolution @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the template stellar spectrums and @xmath68 is the broadening function .",
    "we can then compute the residuals between the convolved model and the galaxy spectrum : @xmath69 in the fourier fitting method ( @xcite ) , this @xmath70 calculation is performed in the fourier domain , such that the fourier transform of the convolved template is matched to the transform of the galaxy spectrum : @xmath71    when measuring velocity dispersions , we are most interested in finding the broadening function which produces the best match to the absorption features . while single stellar spectra can provide good matches to galaxy absorption features , the continuum of a stellar spectrum does not match the continuum of a galaxy spectrum well at all . for our high redshift spectra , the detector response also alters the continuum shape with respect to the templates .",
    "the low wavenumbers which describe the general shape of galaxy and stellar spectra have little , if anything , to do with the computational problem of deriving losvds , but can contribute substantially to the @xmath70 summation .",
    "therefore , an important aspect of measuring velocity dispersions is the matching of the template continuum to that of the galaxy . in the fourier fitting method ( @xcite ) ,",
    "low wavenumbers are filtered during the summation of @xmath70 .",
    "this filtering helps minimize mismatch between stellar templates and galaxy spectra by essentially using sines and cosines as additive functions to match the continuum of the template to that of the galaxy : @xmath72/2 ,   & $ f_{\\rm low}\\le f < 2f_{\\rm low}$;\\cr 1 & $ 2 f_{\\rm low}\\le f$.\\cr}\\ ] ] such that the @xmath70 summation can now be written as @xmath73 the weight vector equals zero , at frequencies at or below @xmath74 , and unity , at frequencies at or greater than @xmath75 .",
    "the filter is a continuous function of wavenumber so that the method is insensitive to the precise cutoff , and can be thought of as having an effective frequency cut of @xmath76 . put another way , continuum matching by the fourier fitting method consists of specifically removing long - wave sines and cosines from both star and galaxy . in order for our velocity dispersions to be comparable to those of jrgensen  ( 1995 )",
    ", we adopt the same restframe filter window of @xmath77^{-1}$ ] and use @xmath78 .",
    "when measuring velocity dispersions of high redshift galaxies additional , non - uniform sources of noise in the data can complicate the analysis . at high redshift ,",
    "galaxy spectra are redshifted to wavelengths where bright night - sky emission lines are present .",
    "the shot - noise in these lines are a strong source of local noise in the resulting galaxy spectra .",
    "furthermore , sharp residuals from the subtraction of the flux in these lines adds high - frequency noise to the extracted galaxy spectra .",
    "therefore , we constructed a direct fitting algorithm , which allows for a more complicated treatment of the data .      in fourier methods every pixel receives identical weight in the fit of the broadened template to the galaxy spectrum .",
    "uniform weighting , however , is not always desired , especially when there exist highly localized sources of noise in the data .",
    "such noise adds high frequency power to the power spectrum of the data , leading to additional uncertainty in the @xmath70 fit . at best , one can attempt to globally reduce the effects of such noise in fourier methods using , _",
    "e.g. _ , wiener filtering ( @xcite ) .    by performing the @xmath70 computation in the real domain ,",
    "however , one can assign weights to individual pixels .",
    "complicated weighting procedures can be adopted , such as , for example , masking of regions of poor sky - subtraction , weighting by the inverse of the expected noise , or masking of specific spectral features such as extraordinarily strong balmer absorption lines or absorption features which have been filled in by emission .",
    "this process allows such features to be excluded from the @xmath70 calculation , leaving the results less sensitive to problematic features and noisy regions of the data . in performing a weighted least - squares fit to galaxy spectra , we modify equation [ eq : genfit ] to include a vector of weights , @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath80    in order to properly treat the non - uniform sources of noise in our cl1358 + 62 data , we developed a variant of the rix & white ( 1992 ) algorithm which determines line - of - sight velocity distributions ( losvds ) by computing @xmath70 in the real domain .",
    "as discussed earlier , we adopt a gaussian function for the parameterized losvd .",
    "when using either the fourier fitting method , or a direct - fitting algorithm , one performs a least - squares fit of broadened templates to the observed galaxy spectra . the only essential difference between the two methods as applied here is the ability to use non - uniform weighting of the data in the real @xmath70 summation .",

    "any mismatch between the observed shapes of the galaxy and stellar spectra arises because the overall shapes of galaxy spectra are not perfectly represented using a single stellar spectral type ; galaxy spectra are complicated composites of many individual stellar spectra .",
    "such differences in the continuum can be approximated by adding a function of wavelength comprised of simple functions , such as polynomials ( @xcite ) , to make up differences between the flux in the template and the flux in the galaxy .",
    "the second type of mismatch between the shapes of galaxy and stellar spectra occurs because the spectra of distant galaxies are obtained with a completely different instrumental setup from the stellar template spectra . in this case",
    ", the galaxy and stellar spectra may have been obtained using different gratings and detectors .",
    "thus , the spectra of the stars and the distant galaxies may have different overall shapes because of the instrumental response function , which is multiplicative .",

    "the inclusion of @xmath81 in the least - squares solution ensures that our results are insensitive to the normalization or flux calibration of galaxy and stellar template spectra ( see below ) .",

    "we use @xmath91 to remove the multiplicative shape differences between the template and galaxy spectra . using @xmath92 or @xmath93 has almost no effect on the resulting velocity dispersions , less than a percent on average . in tests with @xmath94",
    ", we found that the resulting velocity dispersions were systematically higher , but by @xmath95 .",
    "when the multiplicative polynomial is included in the fit , the reduced @xmath70 values were 25% lower than when additive functions were used alone .",
    "this dramatic effect is due to the fact that our template spectra have a very strong slope from blue to red as a result of the grating response function .",
    "matching the overall shapes of the templates with those of the galaxy spectra is clearly an important step in the procedures .",
    "for work on distant galaxies , the difference between the instrumental response function of the galaxy spectra and the templates should not be removed using additive functions alone . by incorporating the renormalization into velocity dispersion fitting procedure ,",
    "we can be confident that all instrumental effects have been accounted for , and their effects on the results have been minimized in a least - squares sense . given the above test , we are confident that differences in the instrumental setup lead to systematic errors which are @xmath96 , and are probably of order @xmath97 .",
    "the parameter @xmath89 is equivalent to the @xmath98 parameter of the fourier fitting method when one uses sines and cosines as the basis functions for the additive continuum components .",

    "has @xmath102 zeroes , @xmath103 .",
    "the results are insensitive to the choice of @xmath87 at the level of a few percent , and merely reflect our susceptibility to template ( continuum ) mismatch , which is discussed below .",
    "additional terms can be added to equation [ chi2 ] for a variety of specialized cases .",

    "thus , the raw data are approximated by a a sum of the sky with the broadened template spectrum : @xmath110\\}\\times w|^2.\\ ] ] in this case , instead of a sky - subtraction being performed on an unconstrained column by column basis , as is nominally done , each pixel in the spectrum contributes to the fit .",
    "the sky spectrum is scaled by a low - order polynomial @xmath111 of order @xmath112 . in the simplest case",
    ", @xmath111 can be a constant , appropriate when large - scale flat - field variations have been accurately removed . however ,",
    "when large - scale flat - fielding may be an issue , the order @xmath112 should be increased .",
    "one can also fit for small shifts in the the sky vector if small rectification errors remain in the data .",
    "such an application may prove useful when working with fiber - fed spectrographs , where determination of an accurate local sky spectrum is problematic , or when analyzing two - dimensional spectra of the low surface brightness halos of cd galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "our new direct fitting method has been tested against another direct fitting algorithm , a direct analog of the franx  ( 1989 ) fourier fitting method which was used by van dokkum  ( 1998b ) to measure velocity dispersions for galaxies in the cluster ms105403 .",
    "they used a program analogous to the fourier fitting method , though its treatment of the continuum filtering is not given by the smooth cosine bell , but has a rigid cutoff instead .",
    "this treatment is similar to the rix & white ( 1992 ) prescription for treatment of the continuum for the case where the continuum functions are sines and cosines .",
    "since our template spectra had different shapes than our galaxy spectra , due to the overall efficiency of the spectrograph decreasing to the blue , we were required to re - normalize the spectrum of the stellar template to the overall shapes of the galaxy spectra . the new methodology which we described in  [ disp ] already includes a multiplicative polynomial in the fitting process . the rix & white methodology does not , nor does the franx real - fitting variant of the fourier fitting method since these programs only use additive continuum functions in the fitting procedures .    we have compared our new direct fitting algorithm to the real variant of the fourier fitting method .",
    "the aperture - corrected values (  [ final ] ) are listed in table [ sigfinal ] , in which the results from the method of  [ direct ] are referred to using @xmath113 and values derived using a real - fitting variant of the fourier fitting method are referred to by @xmath114 .",
    "after renormalizing the templates to the shapes of the galaxy spectra , and deriving new values of @xmath18 with franx s real - fitting variant of the fourier fitting method , we found a mean ( median ) offset of @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) compared to the results of the new direct fitting algorithm described above , with a standard deviation of 2% .",
    "this comparison is illustrated in figure [ realcompare ] , in which we show a histogram of the difference between @xmath59 using the two codes .",
    "another very important consistency check is the comparison of the reported formal errors , @xmath117 .",
    "the two programs report the same formal errors in the mean to @xmath118 of the error , with a standard deviation of 5% of the error .    in order to compare results from our new direct fitting method with that of the original fourier fitting method",
    ", we turned off all pixel masking in the direct - fitting procedure .",
    "thus , any strong residuals due to sky - subtraction needed to be interpolated over to ensure that they did not strongly affect the velocity dispersion fitting , corresponding to the usual procedures for fourier fitting .    for templates with spectral types later than solar , agreement is quite good , with very small systematic differences between velocity dispersions measured with the two algorithms . for most of the stars ,",
    "the agreement is at the level of @xmath119 , with a typical scatter of 3 - 4% .",
    "such offsets can arise from differences in the way in which the stellar continuum is filtered and matched to the galaxy spectra .",
    "the continuum filtering is an important part of minimizing the mismatch between the broadened stellar templates and the galaxy spectra , and any differences in this process will be most important for stars which already provide poor matches to the galaxy spectra . in figure [ fourcompare ] we show the comparison using the adopted template hd72324 , for those galaxies which required no masking of emission or excess balmer absorption .    after these tests ,",
    "we conclude that the velocity dispersion measurements made using the direct fitting method are comparable to those made with both the classical fourier fitting method and its real - fitting variant , as used by van dokkum  ( 1998b ) .",
    "the fitting procedure(s ) outlined in the previous sections provide two diagnostics for determining which template star best matches the galaxy data . first , the direct fitting procedure produces a fitted template , which allows one to visually inspect the residuals and the quality of the fit . in general ,",
    "visual inspection allows one to sort out the best two or three templates .",
    "the @xmath70 determinations allow us to determine the best - fit template quantitatively , rather than visually .",
    "many of the galaxies show enhanced balmer absorption , two show emission , and sharp sky - line residuals exist in nearly all of the galaxy spectra ( _ e.g. _ 5577  ) .",
    "therefore , for every galaxy , we chose to consistently mask the regions around na and [ o i ] , the strongest sky - line residuals in the spectral regions fitted .",
    "some galaxies also required the masking of strong balmer lines .",
    "the e+as ( _ e.g. _ i d # 209 , 328 , and 343 ) have strong , broad h@xmath120 and h@xmath82 absorption which are not well - matched by any of our current set of template spectra .",
    "the emission line sb galaxy i d # 234 and the cd galaxy i d # 375 required the masking of the h@xmath120 and h@xmath82 emission features , as well as [ o iii ] .",
    "the star with the lowest median @xmath70 , overall , is hd72324 ( g9iii ) .",
    "we therefore adopt the velocity dispersions found using the template hd72324 , regardless of any individual galaxy s lowest @xmath70 . the star which gave the second lowest @xmath70 was hd102494 ( g9iv ) .",
    "dispersions derived using this star were only offset systematically from values derived using hd72324 by 1% .",
    "below each galaxy spectrum in figure [ spectra ] we plot the residuals from the fit of the template hd72324 .",
    "regions which have been masked because of sky line residuals are also masked from these plots .",
    "regions of the spectra which were excluded from the fitting due to emission or abnormally strong balmer absorption are shown in the figure , and the reader can easily see that the galaxies possess a wide range of stellar population and star - formation properties .",
    "the balmer and metal line characteristics of the sample will be analyzed in detail in a later paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "there still remains the possibility of residual template mismatch _ within _ the sample , artificially inflating the scatter in the fundamental plane . to test the magnitude of this effect , we compared dispersions derived using hd72324 , to the set of dispersions found using the lowest @xmath70 on an individual basis . for those galaxies which do not have hd72324 as best - fit template , the mean offset is @xmath121 , with a standard deviation of @xmath122 . since these galaxies make up less than half the sample , the effect is actually much smaller over the entire sample .",
    "our method of determining velocity dispersions explicitly assumes that a single stellar spectrum can provide a good match to any given galaxy spectra . in general",
    ", one should not expect any single star to give a perfect fit , since galaxy spectra are comprised of the spectra of a range of stellar spectral types .",
    "some of the mismatch between the stellar template and the galaxy spectrum is compensated by the continuum matching described earlier .",
    "remaining mismatch over spatial frequencies smaller than the filter window , both in the continuum , and in the detailed depth and shapes of the absorption lines , can be fitted using composite templates . while the fit can be improved significantly ( @xcite ) , this effect is , at most , a few percent ( @xcite ) .",
    "discrepant absorption line depths and small - scale power in the continuum will depend on several physical parameters , the overall chemical and spectral makeup of a galaxy itself , the metal abundances in the star from which the template spectrum was obtained , the spectral type of the star , etc .",
    "therefore , one might expect that the velocity dispersions one finds will vary , systematically , with the spectral type and metallicity of the adopted template ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ mismatch ] shows the sensitivity of the measured velocity dispersions for our galaxies to the template s spectral type in the direct - fitting method .",
    "the figure shows how the variation of @xmath18 with template spectral type is systematic .",
    "the separate panels show the logarithmic difference between each of the templates and the average of the five g9-k3 stars , chosen as a reference .",
    "the most deviant template is that of the solar spectrum ( g2v ) . using the solar spectrum as a template gives dispersions which are quite deviant , 15% lower on average , systematically .",
    "the next worse template is the g5iv star hd5268 , which gives values 4% lower than those obtained with the best fit template hd72324 .",
    "a variation of mismatch with dispersion can be a worry for fundamental plane work , since , in principle , the slope with respect to @xmath123 can be biased . in the extreme case of the solar spectrum ,",
    "the offset in @xmath18 from the values obtained from late - type stars differs between a 100  galaxy and a 300  galaxy by about @xmath124 ; the slope of the fp is then biased by @xmath125",
    ". however , the stars with the lowest @xmath70 values yield values for @xmath18 which systematically differ by at most a percent or two over such a long baseline of @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the impact on the fundamental plane slope is only a few percent .",
    "template mismatch is also a function of the absorption line strengths in the stellar spectra ( at a given spectral type ) .",
    "two of our stars , the two g9iii stars , have metallicities differing by a factor of 10 ( @xcite ) . to zeroth - order , this difference is compensated for by @xmath82 , the line - strength parameter in the velocity dispersion fits .",
    "this compensations is clearly seen in the case of these two stars , as the average ratio of @xmath126 .",
    "these two stars with identical spectral type , and a factor of 10 difference in metal abundances , show a 3% systematic offset in velocity dispersion .",
    "they also show a 3% systematic trend in @xmath18 over a baseline of 0.5 dex in @xmath18 , but only a 2% trend when one excludes those galaxies with @xmath127 . by choosing the best - fit template , one s systematic template mismatch errors",
    "should therefore be smaller still . by simply choosing a late - type star , one is already reducing the mismatch errors to a few percent .",
    "procedures have been developed which combine multiple template spectra to create an optimal match to the galaxies ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "such algorithms adjust the mix ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath82 ) of stars to create a non - negative distribution of stellar components .",
    "the direct - fitting method can be expanded fit for an optimal combination of template spectra , as shown in  [ otherforms ] but such an algorithm is not necessary for our purposes .",
    "our uncertainties due to template mismatch are already small , at a level comparable to the formal errors from the velocity dispersion fits .",
    "there is an additional important test which serves two purposes . by comparing velocity dispersions derived from different sections of the galaxy spectra one",
    "can determine if ( 1 ) one has indeed used a template which best matches the galaxy spectra globally ; and if ( 2 ) the measured velocity dispersions depend on the spectral region used in the fit .",
    "the latter is an important question since our fitting is targeted at a region of the spectrum containing the g band ; we wish to know if our measurements can be compared to velocity dispersions measured in other regions of galaxy spectra ( _ e.g. _ , mg @xmath128 ) .",
    "if one is using a template which provides a perfect match to a given galaxy spectrum , then one should measure identical values for @xmath18 using any region of the spectrum .",
    "the practical approach to this is to test if the dispersion measured from the blue side of the spectrum equals that measured from the red side .",
    "therefore , we split our galaxy spectra in two , and measured @xmath18 from the two halves , for the 46 galaxy spectra with @xmath129 per pixel in _ both _ halves .",
    "figure [ sides ] shows the logarithmic difference in @xmath18 from the two sides for each template .",
    "the best - fit template star , hd72324 , yields a mean difference in @xmath18 between the two halves of less than a percent .",
    "in fact , most of the template stars give reasonable results .",
    "the rest of the stars , aside from the solar spectrum , all show absolute differences on the order or less than a few percent .",
    "the solar spectrum shows a median difference between the two halves of @xmath130 .    as a result of these multiple tests ,",
    "we are confident that our errors due to template mismatch are likely to be small , at the level of a few percent , comparable to the formal errors in the fit .",
    "early - type galaxies have radial gradients in velocity dispersion and radial velocity .",
    "the implication is that the @xmath18 one measures depends upon the metric aperture used to extract the original spectra .",
    "the aperture is defined by an angular extent upon the sky , so the metric aperture which defines the velocity dispersion typically increases with distance to a given galaxy .",
    "the dependence of @xmath18 upon aperture is not straightforward to predict because the measurement is a luminosity - weighted mean velocity dispersion within the predefined aperture .",
    "furthermore , early - type galaxies can be partially supported by rotation , and velocity dispersion measurements made using large metric apertures will reflect the total second moment of the integrated line - of - sight velocity distribution : @xmath131 .",
    "the integration of this quantity is weighted by the surface brightness distribution of the galaxy within the aperture of the spectrograph .",
    "thus , measurements of @xmath132 depend on each galaxy s intrinsic distribution of orbits , as well as its light distribution .",
    "our velocity dispersion measurements will be compared directly with similar measurements made with nearby galaxies , _",
    "e.g. _ jrgensen  ( 1996 ) . therefore , one source of concern is that the galaxies in the cl1358 + 62 sample may have different internal structure than nearby galaxies .",
    "we begin exploring the magnitude of this effect by comparing the kinematic profiles of our galaxies with those of nearby galaxies .    with the excellent image quality and high @xmath1 of the data , we were able to extract rotation curves and velocity dispersion profiles . using the direct - fitting method of  [ direct ] we measured @xmath63 and @xmath18 along each slitlet .",
    "when necessary , rows were binned to achieve sufficient @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath70 sum used the same masking and noise - weighting as in the determination of the @xmath133 aperture dispersions .",
    "two of the galaxies have @xmath1 ratios too poor to provide spatially resolved kinematics ( # 360 and # 493 ) .",
    "the profiles can be seen in figure [ kinprof ] , where absorption line rotation curves and velocity dispersion profiles are plotted adjacently for each galaxy .",
    "these profiles have not been corrected for seeing , nor for non - major axis positioning of the slitlets . for most high - redshift galaxies ,",
    "the rise in the rotation curve has been heavily modified by seeing ( see , for example , the modeling of @xcite ) .      in order to test whether aperture corrections derived from nearby galaxies can be applied to the high redshift sample , we now compare the kinematic profiles in figure [ kinprof ] to those of nearby galaxies . for this comparison ,",
    "we use 83 early - type galaxies in the kinematic database of simien & prugniel ( 1997a , b , c ) and construct @xmath134 as a function of radius using their long - slit rotation curves and velocity dispersion profiles . in figure [ localprof ] , we show the logarithmic gradients of @xmath135 , normalized by the mean value within @xmath136 ( we plot only those data with uncertainties smaller than 10% ) .",

    "a least - squares fit to all of the cl1358 + 62 galaxies yields a logarithmic gradient of @xmath143 per dex , consistent with the sample of nearby galaxies .    from the figures , we draw several important conclusions .",
    "first , the @xmath135 profiles of e / s0s and early - type spirals have small gradients , both locally , and at @xmath0 .",
    "second , within @xmath144 , the gradients are independent of morphology .",
    "least - squares fits to the gradients in the spirals are not significantly different from fits to the gradients in the e / s0s .",
    "the scatter in the @xmath135 profiles at @xmath0 is remarkably consistent with that in the nearby galaxies .",
    "we therefore conclude that aperture corrections derived from nearby galaxies can safely be used on the full sample of cl1358 + 62 galaxies .",
    "jrgensen  ( 1995 ) used existing spectroscopic and photometric data of nearby galaxies in the literature to construct models which were `` observed '' through a series of concentric apertures of increasing size .",
    "major - axis long - slit slit spectroscopy , by itself , is not suitable for deriving such corrections .",
    "they found that the following power law can be used to correct the observed dispersions , @xmath145 , to a physical aperture : @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the corrected velocity dispersions within an aperture @xmath148 , and @xmath149 is the aperture of the observation .",
    "for this paper , we use @xmath148 as the nominal aperture of @xmath150 for galaxies at the distance of coma , and @xmath149 is the effective aperture for cl1358 + 62 of @xmath151 ( see  [ data ] ) .",
    "we used eq .",
    "[ eq : apcor ] to correct the observed velocity dispersions to an aperture consistent with the comparison sample of jrgensen  ( 1996 ) . using @xmath152",
    ", we obtain values from the standard aperture at coma of @xmath153 kpc , and an aperture size of @xmath154 kpc at @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , our measured velocity dispersions underestimate the central values by @xmath155 .",
    "most of the slitlets were not tilted and thus do not suffer additional broadening .",
    "the most extreme case of a @xmath49 tilt ( see  [ data ] ) changes the aperture correction to @xmath156 .",
    "thus , we adopt a single aperture correction , regardless of slit tilt .",
    "the final velocity dispersions have therefore been multiplied by a factor of @xmath157 .",
    "the velocity dispersions , corrected to an aperture equivalent to the nominal aperture at the distance of coma , are listed in table [ sigfinal ] .",
    "a histogram of central velocity dispersions is given in figure [ sighist ] .",
    "when measuring velocity dispersions potential sources of error can exist at several stages in the procedures .",
    "uncertainties are introduced by the templates themselves , as well as by the galaxy spectra .",
    "poor @xmath1 clearly introduces large random errors , but can also introduce systematic errors ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the imposition of a single stellar component on a galaxy spectrum , of any @xmath1 , can produce mismatch errors .",
    "we attempt to itemize these sources of error in a quantitative manner , and estimate to what extent our measurements are affected by them .      at the outset , a potentially large source of error can be improperly measured resolution . in  [ prep ] we found that the uncertainty in the absolute resolution of the template spectra is uncertain by no more than 5 .",
    "this translates to an error at @xmath54  of 2.5% .",
    "since the resolution is more important for low velocity dispersions , there is almost no effect for galaxies with @xmath55 . over the baseline of 100  to 300 ,",
    "the mean systematic effect on the velocity dispersions is of order 1 - 2% . given that the systematic effect is a function of velocity dispersion , there is a net uncertainty in the derived fundamental plane slopes of about @xmath158 .      in  [ dispcor ]",
    ", we showed that the total kinematic profiles of the cl1358 + 62 galaxies is similar to those of nearby galaxies , and concluded that the jrgensen  ( 1995 ) form of the aperture corrections remained valid for our sample .",
    "we therefore conclude that any systematic error in adopting their aperture corrections for the entire sample is going to be negligible compared to other sources of error , such as template mismatch .",
    "more sophisticated modeling is required to better estimate this uncertainty .      according to jrgensen  ( 1995 ) ,",
    "if the @xmath1 ratio of galaxy spectra are too low , the derived velocity dispersions will be measured systematically high ( see their figure 3 ) .",

    "this measurement is in error by only + 2% . for this galaxy",
    ", the low @xmath1 appears to be due to poor subtraction of the background in a crowded region of the sky .",
    "the slitlet containing # 360 is @xmath162 long , with # 360 at one end , partially covering the outskirts of the cd # 375 at the other end , and containing # 368 in between the two .",
    "the other four spectra have measured velocity dispersions between 100 km / s and 140 km / s and , according to the simulations of jrgensen  ( 1995 ) , may be systematically too large by 1 - 2% as well . given that these systematic uncertainties are much smaller than the formal uncertainties , and that only four galaxies , at most , are affected , we do not include any corrections for this effect .",
    "the formal errors in the velocity dispersions have two primary components : random errors due to photon statistics and systematic errors due to , for example , template mismatch . in this section , we determine to what extent our formal errors are dominated by the random or systematic errors .    we compare the systematic errors due to template mismatch to the random errors by comparing three estimators of @xmath1 : ( 1 ) the @xmath1 ratio per   expected solely from considerations of the read noise and noise in the sky and galaxy ; ( 2 ) @xmath163 , the ratio of the velocity dispersion with its formal error ; and ( 3 ) @xmath164 , the ratio of the mean flux level in the galaxy and the standard deviation of the residuals in the velocity dispersion fit . in the case where one uses a perfect template spectrum and",
    "no noise has been added to the data during the reduction process , @xmath164 should be equivalent to the expected @xmath1 .",
    "all of these are related ( since the expected noise was used in the calculation of weights in the fitting ) , and we can use them to disentangle the contributors to our uncertainties .    in figure [ s2n](a ) we plot @xmath164 as a function of the expected @xmath1 ratio ( per pixel in this case ) .",
    "the data do not follow the line of unity slope .",
    "for those spectra with high @xmath1 , the residuals from the fit are larger than would be expected from photon statistics .",
    "this point is repeated in figure [ s2n](b ) in which we specifically show the ratio of @xmath165 as a function of expected @xmath1 .",
    "when the @xmath1 approaches @xmath166 , the template mismatch errors become the dominant source of uncertainty .",
    "therefore , we do not see a constant level in ( b ) , but a trend with @xmath1 in which the quality of the fit begins to suffer compared to what one would expect from noise considerations alone .",
    "this fact can also be seen by inspecting the residuals from the fits in figure [ spectra ] , in which there appear to be consistent features in the galaxy spectra which are not well matched by the the fitted template .",
    "in figure [ s2n](c ) we plot @xmath163 , the formal signal - to - noise in the dispersion , as a function of @xmath164 , the quality of the fit for each spectrum . for most galaxies",
    ", there is clearly a one - to - one correspondence . in ( d ) , the ratio is plotted as a function of @xmath164 so that one can more clearly see the discrepant data points .",
    "thus our error estimates are consistent with the  scatter about the fit , though some galaxies clear deviate from this expectation .",
    "there are a handful of spectra , however , with velocity dispersion uncertainties which are larger than expected from the  residuals of the fit .",
    "we show in in figure [ s2n](e ) that the errors are dominated by atypically large template mismatch .",
    "these are the galaxies with small values of the the line - strength parameter @xmath82 .",
    "these points with very low @xmath82 values are galaxies # 209 ( both spectra ) , # 234 , # 328 , and # 343 , the e+a and emission - line galaxies . for these cases ,",
    "the formal errors in the velocity dispersion are higher than expected for the quality of the fit of a single template star , even though the strong balmer absorption lines and emission lines were given zero weight in the fit .",
    "we conclude that for the galaxies with @xmath167 , our velocity dispersion uncertainties are dominated by systematic errors , such as template mismatch errors ( and as noted , these errors are @xmath168 ) .      for the galaxies in common with kelson  ( 1997 )",
    ", the agreement in @xmath18 is 1% in the mean , with a scatter of 4 - 5% , consistent with the formal uncertainties .",
    "we can estimate the internal consistency of the dataset using two galaxies which were measured in two different masks .",
    "galaxy i d # 493 was observed at two different position angles , @xmath49 apart .",
    "the two velocity dispersions , @xmath169  and @xmath170 , agree very well .",
    "the other galaxy , i d # 209 , is an e+a whose spectrum required masking of the strong balmer absorption .",
    "the two observations for this galaxy do not agree because the one with the smaller @xmath18 was made with a slightly mis - aligned slitlet . in this discrepant observation , the galaxy was a secondary target in a slitlet which was centered on a different galaxy and subsequently tilted to include # 209 .",
    "the slitlet was not correctly tilted to encompass the center of # 209 , and thus the galaxy was not centered in the slitlet .",
    "thus , the seeing convolved galaxy did not evenly fill the slit , leaving a strong gradient of its light profile across the slit .",
    "thus , its light profile under - filled the slit width , leading to an improper estimate of the resolution of its spectrum .",
    "furthermore , the resulting dispersion is not a central value , but one offset from the center .",
    "thus , the larger value of @xmath171  is the more credible measurement .",
    "no other galaxies in this sample were secondary targets within slitlets .      at these high redshifts",
    ", it might be expected that small galaxy sizes , combined with the good seeing of our observations , might lead us to under - fill the 105 wide slitlets . if a galaxy under - fills a slitlet , then the broadening , as measured by the sky - line widths ,",
    "would be overestimated , because the galaxy light is coming from an effective aperture narrower than the slitlet .",
    "fortunately , the galaxies in this sample are generally not small enough to cause problems .",
    "as shown in kelson  ( 1999a ) the smallest galaxy , # 493 , has a half - light radius of 02 .",
    "using the spatial profile along the slit of this galaxy , within a box @xmath172 wide , we have convolved a spectrum of the sky , and compare the widths of the convolved lines with the widths of the sky lines convolved by a top - hat @xmath172 wide .",
    "one does find that the sky lines are narrower in the case where the galaxy profile was used in the convolution , but the effect is approximately 2% of the measured widths .",
    "we therefore conclude that under - filling of the slitlets is a negligible source of error .",
    "given the number of sources of systematic error , we estimate that the total systematic errors in the order of @xmath95 , generally larger than the random errors expected from photon statistics alone",
    "we have accurately measured the internal kinematics of a large , homogeneous sample of galaxies , within the cluster cl1358 + 62 .",
    "these data will be combined with the structural parameters in kelson ( 1999a ) for the analysis of @xmath11 ratios and the fundamental plane of early - type galaxies ( @xcite . these direct measurement of velocity dispersions , will provide crucial mass estimates for these galaxies , enabling us to provide constraints on early - type galaxy evolution and their epoch(s ) of formation .",
    "the formal errors are quite small , typically a few percent . for galaxies with @xmath173",
    "( roughly half the sample ) , the uncertainties are dominated by the systematic errors , which appear to be at a level of @xmath95 .    these velocity dispersion measurements can be compared directly to those made in nearby galaxies .",
    "we have measured @xmath18 using a new variant of direct ( real ) fitting .",
    "results from this method have been compared with those of the fourier fitting method ( @xcite ) , and we find excellent agreement between the two programs .",
    "differences between the two algorithms lead to systematic uncertainties in @xmath18 on the order of @xmath174 , with a scatter consistent with the formal errors .",
    "we have measured absorption - line kinematic profiles for most of the galaxies in this sample .",
    "the cl1358 + 62 galaxies show a wide range of rotational support .",
    "however , the profiles of the total second moment of the losvds , @xmath175 , do not vary greatly from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "thus , we conclude that a single aperture correction can be applied to our entire sample . furthermore , because the kinematic profiles of the cl1358 + 62 galaxies are similar to those of nearby galaxies , we conclude that we have reliably corrected our large - metric - aperture velocity dispersions to an effective aperture consistent with the nearby galaxy samples of jrgensen ( 1995 ) .    for many of the galaxies , the raw kinematic profiles reach 2 - 3 @xmath19 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , due to the effects of seeing and the large ( metric ) slit width , sophisticated modeling is required to derive the true kinematic profiles to such large radii .",
    "e+as appear to be largely supported by rotation .",
    "this is consistent with the presence of disks , as shown in hst imaging of intermediate redshift e+a galaxies in this , and other clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "these galaxies do not appear to be massive , having velocity dispersions of @xmath176 .",
    "a more detailed discussion of these galaxies is given in the context of the fundamental plane and the @xmath11 ratios of cluster galaxies in kelson  ( 1999b ) .",
    "this sample , with more than fifty galaxies in a single cluster , shows that the new , large - aperture telescopes can provide extremely accurate , high quality spectroscopic data on distant galaxies .",
    "such data provide estimates of mass scales , such as those presented here , and absorption line strengths , to be discussed in a future paper ( @xcite ) . in the future",
    ", larger surveys will provide a more coherent picture in which several hundreds of such galaxies can be analyzed simultaneously , leading to precision measurements of the evolving mass function , constraining the detailed evolution of @xmath11 ratios and merger rates in both the field and in clusters .",
