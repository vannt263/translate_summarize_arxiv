    "to understand how the solar corona is heated to high temperatures , it is important to explain the heating of closed field structures such as active region loops .",
    "there have been extensive studies of these structures , and recent progress and outstanding issues have been reviewed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a key diagnostic of the heating of coronal loops is the differential emission measure ( dem ) distribution , because many coronal heating models make specific predictions as to its form and shape .",
    "for example , nanoflare reconnection models @xcite predict the presence of a weak high temperature component in the dem @xcite .",
    "there have been several recent studies that have tried to detect this emission @xcite .",
    "the dem gradient , or proportion of hot and cool material , also sets constraints on impulsive , steady or quasi - steady loop heating models @xcite , and the nanoflare model also predicts a spread in the temperature distribution within a loop due to the incoherent heating and cooling of unresolved threads .",
    "there has been considerable debate as to whether loops have a multi - thermal temperature distribution because of conflicting measurements by different instruments @xcite .",
    "the discussion hinges on issues such as background subtraction , methodology @xcite , or the spatial resolution @xcite , or temperature resolution of the instruments used @xcite .",
    "recent observations by the _ hinode _",
    "@xcite euv imaging spectrometer ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eis ) suggest that loops formed near 1mk have a narrow temperature distribution , but are not isothermal @xcite .",
    "doppler velocity measurements are another important diagnostic of the heating process , and again there have been numerous recent studies of flows in active region loops using eis data . some of the signatures of coronal heating models are expected to be quite subtle , however .",
    "the nanoflare reconnection model predicts weak downflows at ` warm ' temperatures , and short - lived faint upflows at high temperatures .",
    "the signatures of nanoflare heating in spectral line profiles therefore depend sensitively on the temperature of the flows , and this also implies that accurate measurements will allow inference of the properties of the energy release .",
    "it is important therefore to assign the flow temperatures as accurately as possible .",
    "a class of loops that have not yet been studied in sufficient detail with the latest instrumentation are the fan structures that appear as partially observed long loops at the edges of active regions .",
    "they are seen mostly in the 0.41.3mk temperature range and have densities greater than @xmath4 = 9 @xcite .",
    "they also appear to show red - shifted downflows @xcite .",
    "we examine a sample of these structures in this paper .    for this and all the above observational studies ,",
    "spectral emission from ions of fe is of major importance .",
    "the high elemental abundance of fe leads to many strong emission lines in spectrometer and imager pass - bands , yet interpretation of the observations is often difficult because of uncertainties in the atomic data used in prediction of emission @xcite . in principle , the emission from spectral lines of fe can provide stringent constraints on temperatures and densities in the corona , however , it is of paramount importance that the diagnostic capabilities of fe lines be assessed critically .",
    "initial results from eis have indicated a number of problems in interpreting the fe emission .",
    "@xcite noted that spectroheliograms of and look very similar in specific active region features such as the fan loops , despite the fact that the temperatures of the peak fractional abundance in ionization equilibrium are significantly different ; @xmath5 = 5.6 and 5.8 , respectively , according to @xcite . since fe is a considerably more complex atom than si and is therefore likely to be less well understood ,",
    "this observation has led to the suggestion that the ionization balance calculations for need to be revised upward to higher temperatures @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this could have an impact on surrounding ions such as and .",
    "recently , found evidence that this is indeed the case for .",
    "in addition to this temperature problem , a number of previous differential emission measure ( dem ) studies have found difficulties reproducing the absolute intensities of and lines simultaneously .",
    "see , for example , the quiet sun off - limb dem analysis of , the on disk quiet sun study of @xcite , or the analysis of a cool active region feature by .",
    "such issues are important to resolve as the 185.213 and 275.368 lines would provide the best eis lower temperature constraints on the dem if we had good confidence in the atomic data .",
    "also , since they are strong , they are the best lines to use for velocity measurements in the transition region , and are present in the majority of eis observations .",
    "as discussed , it is therefore of critical importance that we have confidence in the temperatures we assign to the measured velocities .",
    "changes to the formation temperatures or atomic data for these ions could also have an impact on interpreting the results from imagers .",
    "for example , changes to could affect the response functions for the 131 channel of the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) on the _ solar dynamics observatory ( sdo)_.    motivated by our interest in studying the temperature and velocity structure of the fan loops , this situation has led us to take a closer look at the formation of the and spectral lines . recently , there have been a number of revisions to the ionization balance calculations @xcite and we investigate whether they could help resolve these inconsistencies .",
    "we also examine the details of spectral line formation in this temperature range in the quiet sun and in the fan loops . in particular , we examine whether convolving the contribution functions with the temperature distribution of the feature could explain the similarity of and images .",
    "it is known that the temperature of peak contribution to the line intensity can be shifted from the theoretical peak temperature of the emissivity if the shape of the dem is taken into consideration @xcite . in doing so",
    ", we finally show that the ionization equilibrium calculations for fe may not be the source of this problem . by determining more realistic effective formation temperatures",
    ", we present a possible explanation for the observations .",
    "we also show that the most recent ionization balance calculations can resolve the discrepancies in the magnitudes of the intensities found in previous studies .    with confidence in the atomic data for these ions restored ,",
    "we perform an emission measure ( em ) analysis of a number of fan loops using eis and aia and compare the results from the two instruments .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows example images of ar 10978 in ( top left to bottom right ) 276.579 , 268.986 , 280.737 , 275.368 , 194.663 , 197.862 , and 184.536 .",
    "these images are formed at @xmath5 = 5.4 , 5.6 , 5.8 , 5.8 , 5.6 , 5.8 , and 6.0 , respectively , according to @xcite .",
    "the data were obtained on 2007 , december 10 , at 00:19:27ut .",
    "the eis instrument has 4 slit options ( 1@xmath6 , 2@xmath6 , 40@xmath6 , and 266@xmath6 ) .",
    "the 1@xmath6 slit was used for these observations and stepped over a fov of 460@xmath6 by 384@xmath6 .",
    "the exposure time was 40s at each position .",
    "the data were processed using standard eis data reduction routines available in solarsoft ( eis_prep ) .",
    "it is clear that the images do not follow the expected temperature trend .",
    "the and images look very similar , especially in the fan structures to solar east of the ar and the cool loops to solar west .",
    "this suggests a similar temperature of formation .",
    "in addition , the and images look to be formed at lower and higher temperatures , respectively .",
    "note , for example , the third column of the figure .",
    "the vertical extent of the cool features to solar west and the fan structures to solar east appears to increase from top to bottom ( to to ) suggesting an increase in temperatures .",
    "the problem identified by @xcite is clearly seen in these examples .",
    "in this work we use several sources of atomic data as follows .",
    "all the contribution functions are calculated using the chianti v6.0.1 database @xcite .",
    "the coronal abundances of @xcite were used , together with the ionization fractions of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we use four specific lines to explore how their formation temperatures change in the quiet sun : 268.986 , 185.213 , 275.368 , and 188.485 . for these lines we used the effective collision strengths and radiative data of , @xcite , , and @xcite , respectively .",
    "a large number of additional spectral lines were used to compute dems and the data sources for these secondary data are too numerous to list here .",
    "we refer the interested reader to the chianti database where the references are given in detail .",
    "the intensity of an optically thin emission line arising from an atomic transition from level @xmath7 to level @xmath8 can be expressed as @xmath9 where the differential emission measure ( dem ) is defined as , @xmath10 with @xmath11 the differential distance along the line of sight and @xmath12 the electron density .",
    "the contribution function is defined as @xmath13 with @xmath14 the elemental abundance , @xmath15 the hydrogen number density , @xmath16 the line emissivity normalized to the ground state population , and @xmath17 the ionization fraction as a function of temperature and density .",
    "the accuracy of the computation of @xmath18 for fe and si is important for this paper . in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we contrast the @xcite ionization equilbrium calculations for and with the updated results of @xcite .",
    "note that the peak formation temperature does not change , so the temperature problem remains .",
    "the maximum fractional abundance , however , increases by 10% for and 55% for .",
    "these changes could be important when modeling the magnitudes of the absolute intensities .",
    "note that the @xcite calculations give the same formation temperatures for and as @xcite .",
    "the maximum fractional abundances are also within 10% .    ]",
    "the function @xmath19 is strongly peaked at the characteristic temperature of the line , but the temperature of peak contribution to the total intensity can be shifted from the theoretical one if there is relatively more emitting material at higher or lower temperatures .",
    "another key issue for this paper is that if the contribution function is broad , there may be significant contributions to the total intensity from multiple temperatures . in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , note that the curve is significantly broader than that of in the new @xcite calculation , and encompasses much of the temperature range of that ion",
    ". a further refinement to the analysis then , is to calculate the _ effective formation temperature _ ( t@xmath20 ) of the line by convolving the contribution function with the dem distribution for the target region or structure of interest , and then taking the temperature at which that function has its maximum value .",
    "@xmath21 where @xmath22 is obtained by differentiating equation [ eq1 ] , viz .",
    "@xmath23      before turning to the ar fan loops ,",
    "we first investigate the formation temperatures of lines in the quiet sun .",
    "since we are also interested in how the more recent ionization balance calculations affect the derived dem , and whether they could help in resolving known discrepancies , we derived a new qs dem using the latest updated atomic data from v6.0.1 of the chianti database and adopting the ionization fractions calculated by @xcite . throughout this paper",
    "we use the pre - launch laboratory photometric calibration of eis @xcite .",
    "perhaps the best way to test the accuracy of the atomic data is to use off - limb qs observations where there is less contamination along the line of sight from multiple temperatures .",
    "therefore , we selected lines for analysis that were identified as yielding consistent emission measure distributions above the quiet solar limb .",
    "most of them are taken from table 4 of .",
    "the critical issue here , however , is the consistency of lines in the temperature range where , , and are formed , and it would be best if we had independent constraints on the dem that do not involve these lines .",
    "therefore , we used deep exposure observations of an on - disk qs dataset .",
    "deep exposure data are helpful for bringing out the weaker cool lines below @xmath5 = 5.8 , that would be harder to detect off - limb , and therefore for constraining the dem at the lower temperature end .",
    "this also allows us to directly compare the results to that of @xcite where various inconsistencies in observed and predicted intensities were found in on - disk data using the older ionization balance calculations .",
    "the data used were taken on 2009 june 14 starting at 09:59:42ut .",
    "context images of the quiet region are shown in figure [ fig3 ] including both 275.368 and 185.213 , which again look very similar .",
    "the eis study used the 2@xmath6 slit with 4 min exposures and scanned a fov of 60@xmath24 512@xmath6 in about 2hrs 10 mins .",
    "about 70% of the wavelength range of the ccds were read - out and telemetered to the ground . since this does not cover the full ccd , some of the lines used in were not available .",
    "in addition , we included several important lines of interest for this work , i.e. , 268.986 , 185.213 , and 275.368 , and , as discussed , additional cooler temperature lines to provide constraints on the dem ( 279.631 , 279.933 , 248.456 , 186.601 , 194.663 , 272.641 , 278.402 , and 280.737 ) .",
    "all the lines used are listed in table [ tab1 ] which also shows which lines were selected for the analysis of the fan loops in sections [ ftarcfs ] and [ daea ] .",
    "the data were processed using standard procedures available in solarsoft .",
    "in addition , however , the orbital variation of the line centroids and spectral line tilt were estimated by single gaussian fits to the 195.119 line and removed from the data prior to further analysis .",
    "the offsets in _ x_- and _ y_- between the short and long wavelength ccds were corrected for so that the same area was averaged .",
    "these offsets were estimated using the software developed by @xcite .",
    "the data were then averaged over the common area of the two ccds and fitted using single or multiple gaussians as appropriate .",
    "the method for determination of the dem distribution is the same as described in @xcite , , and @xcite .",
    "briefly , we represent the dem with a series of spline knots , the magnitudes of which are found by @xmath25 minimization of the differences between the observed and dem predicted intensities .",
    "this minimization is performed by the solarsoft routine mpfit @xcite . the number and initial values of the spline knots can be pre - set and they can be interactively manipulated to control the smoothness of the emission measure .",
    "this technique has been found to be useful for representing rapid changes in the dem .",
    "we measured the electron density using the following three line ratios : 196.525/202.044 , 202.044/203.826 , and 186.880/195.119 .",
    "there are a number of issues with blending and the accuracy of the atomic data within certain ranges for these diagnostic ratios that are discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "none of these issues are expected to affect our measurements significantly , however .",
    "the ratios give densities for the quiet sun of @xmath4 = 8.79.0 , indicating a pressure of @xmath26 = 14.915.2 .",
    "the upper ends of these ranges are from , which tends to give higher values @xcite . since we can not rule out that the possibility that this is a real density change with temperature , we choose to assume that the electron pressure is constant .",
    "one of these assumptions is necessary to cast the intensity integral in the form of equation [ eq1 ] and calculate the contribution functions .",
    "we adopt a value of @xmath26 = 15.0 in this work and compute the contribution functions for all the emission lines of table [ tab1 ] using chianti .",
    "the quiet sun dem of @xcite was used to give a first guess for the temperature knots and spline fit to the qs data .",
    "the fit was then adjusted slightly to improve the agreement between observed and predicted intensities .",
    "the results are given in table [ tab1 ] and shown in comparison with our previous result in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "80% of the lines are reproduced to within 30% .",
    "270.519 and 284.160 are significantly overestimated but these lines are very weak in the spectrum and the dem is falling rapidly in this temperature range .",
    "200.021 , 264.787 , and 197.434 are underestimated by the dem but these results are consistent with our previous work , and the latter is blended with 197.362 @xcite .",
    "278.402 is underestimated by about a factor of two , but this discrepancy can be resolved if the contribution from the 278.445 blend is accounted for as described in @xcite .",
    "all of the , , and lines are consistent with each other and the predicted intensities are within 30% of the observed ones .",
    "these results are interesting because the dem curve derived using the updated atomic data and ionization fractions from chianti v6.0.1 resolves the inconsistencies found using older versions in several previous studies of and lines in the quiet sun off limb , on disk , and in cool active region features .                 using equations [ eq3 ] and [ eq4 ] we determined t@xmath20 in the quiet sun for four key lines ( 268.986 , 185.213 , 275.368 , and 188.485 ) .",
    "the gradient of the dem slope in the quiet sun increases in the temperature range of formation of these lines ( figure [ fig3 ] ) so that there is relatively more material above the temperature of the maximum ion abundance for all of them .",
    "this results in all of these lines being formed at temperatures above their maximum ion abundance .",
    "as noted , however , the 185.213 line is particulary sensitive to this because of the larger width of the @xmath27 curve .",
    "it is therefore disproportionately affected , and is actually formed much closer in temperature to 275.368 than the ionization balance would suggest .",
    "an illustrative example is shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "note that the @xmath22 curve for 185.213 is considerably broader than for the other lines , suggesting that there will be contributions from multiple temperatures .",
    "note also that because the contribution functions for individual lines differ within an ion they may also have different effective temperatures .",
    "in the previous section we discussed how the slope of the dem could lead to the 185.213 and 275.368 lines being formed at similar temperatures in the quiet sun .",
    "this dem analysis was made , however , on averaged spectra over a relatively large area , and the differences may not be dramatic because the structure of the atmosphere does not change rapidly over the small temperature interval ( @xmath5 = 5.755.85 ) where the lines are formed .",
    "it is clear , however , that specific features such as the cool fan loops look very similar in and images .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this explanation could hold for these specific features of interest .    to address this question",
    "we investigate the temperature distribution of the extended fan loops in ar 10978 ( shown in figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this active region has previously been studied by several authors .",
    "context images of the region in both 185.213 , and 275.368 are shown in figure [ fig4 ] . as with the analysis of the qs , we corrected for the ccd offsets , orbital variation and spectral line tilt prior to further analysis . in this case",
    "we use the artificial neural network model of @xcite to correct the orbital variation of the line centroids and grating tilt .",
    "the rest of the data processing was accomplished using standard procedures ( eis_prep ) .",
    "the fan region is shown as a large box in figure [ fig4 ] .    also shown in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "is a map of the 185.213/ 275.368 intensity ratio .",
    "this quantitatively describes the similarity of the two images .",
    "note that the ratio appears to vary in the active region core .",
    "185.213 is blended with 185.251 @xcite , which is formed at 2.8mk , and it likely contributes to this emission and influences the ratio . in contrast , one can see that the fan region is almost uniformly dark , indicating little variation in the ratio across this area .",
    "a histogram of the ratio values for the pixels within the boxed region is also shown in the figure .",
    "a gaussian fit to this distribution indicates that the mean value is 2.3 and the standard deviation is 0.34 , i.e. , the variation in the ratio across the fans is less than 15% .",
    "we computed the emission measure in several small boxes extending along one of the fan loops ( shown as regions e1e6 in figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the intensities were averaged in these areas .",
    "the background emission was estimated for each box by averaging the intensities in the adjacent boxes also shown in the figure .",
    "single and multiple gaussian fits were made as appropriate .",
    "for this analysis we used most of the same lines as we used for the qs .",
    "these are indicated in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "a few lines were not available in the current dataset and could not be included .",
    "these lines can also be identified from the table .",
    "furthermore , we included 183.937 , 184.117 , 262.984 , and 265.003 to provide additional low and high temperature constraints .",
    "@xcite analyzed a sample of ` warm ' euv loops in this region by fitting a gaussian distribution in temperature for the model emission measure of the form , @xmath28\\ ] ] for comparison with this work we use the same fitting technique here .",
    "the fit is made by @xmath25 minimization of the differences between the measured and computed intensities .",
    "the density is allowed to be a free parameter in the fitting and we obtain values of @xmath4 = 9.29.7 , decreasing from base to apex .",
    "these results are comparable to the decrease along another example reported by @xcite .",
    "the computed temperature distributions for positions e1e6 along the loop together with their peak temperatures , emission measure , and gaussian width are shown in the top two rows of figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "there are a few problematic lines that are not well reproduced by the model .",
    "they vary by position , but generally include 279.933 , 248.456 , and 183.937 , all of which are underestimated to varying degrees .",
    "furthermore , the background subtracted high temperature lines of and are often underestimated , including the normally robust 202.044 line .",
    "248.456 is blended with an line that is a weak contributor in most conditions , hence the agreement found for in the qs .",
    "the blend , however , could contribute more when the emisison measure is peaked mostly at coronal temperatures .",
    "the 278.402 and 280.737 lines also sometimes show unusual behavior . in most cases",
    "they are reproduced well , but mismatches of 5080% are sometimes seen . in these cases ,",
    "the discrepancies for 278.402 can not be resolved by accounting for the blend with 278.445 .",
    "since it is mostly the low and high temperature lines that show discrepancies it could be that the temperature distribution deviates from a gaussian shape in the wings . in general most of the lines are reproduced well , however . in total , about 80% of the lines are reproduced to within 40% with most better than 30% .",
    "compared to the quiet sun , the fans show a significant enhancement of emission measure ( factor of 37 ) .",
    "the distribution peaks at @xmath5 = 6.0 near the base ( e1 ) and increases along the loop to a maximum of @xmath5 = 6.1 ( e3 and e4 ) before decreasing again .",
    "the dispersion in the gaussian distribution appears to decrease along the loop length .",
    "previous studies of cool loops in active regions have suggested that they are isothermal .",
    "our results indicate that at its narrowest , the width of the emission measure distribution is still @xmath29 5.4 . in comparison with the ` warm ' loops in this region studied by @xcite ,",
    "this fan loop has a broader temperature distribution along most of its length . only towards the tip ( e6 )",
    "does it approach the values for the ` warm ' loops .",
    "note that the gradient of the slope of the emission measure distribution in the temperature range @xmath5 = 5.65.8 is greater than in the quiet sun , even at the base of the fan ( e1 ) .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] also shows the normalized @xmath22 function for the 185.213 , and 275.368 lines that results from convolving their contribution functions with the fan emission measure at each position .",
    "we see that even when the temperature distribution is relatively broad ( e1 ) , the effective formation temperatures of the lines are separated by only 0.1 in the @xmath30 .",
    "it also indicates that the separation in temperatures reduces as we go along the fan loop until they are both formed at the same temperature of @xmath31 = 5.85 .",
    "clearly when the em distribution is narrow in this temperature range the two lines will be formed close together in temperature .",
    "this analysis also shows that this is true even if the em distribution is relatively broad , provided it has a positive gradient .",
    "the 185.213 line seems to be very sensitive to the slope of the em distribution in general .",
    "to examine whether our explanation could hold in general for all fan loops we investigated a number of other cases .",
    "the loops we selected were observed in active region 11093 on 2010 , august 13 . in this analysis",
    ", we also include data obtained by sdo / aia @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , it is also important to understand the formation of spectral lines in detail if we are to correctly interpret observations by euv imagers . the broad wavelength pass - bands of such instruments include multiple lines and their contributions may change in quiet and active conditions .",
    "we illustrate this here by examining the temperature response of the aia 131 filter .",
    "the pass - band of this filter is expected to contain contributions from 130.941 and 131.240 , 132.850 , 128.755 , and 132.906 with the lines the dominant contributor outside of flares . as we have seen , the formation of lines is non - trivial .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows full sun images from aia taken at 10ut .",
    "ar 11093 was the target for _ hinode _ and the eis fov is overlaid as a box ( 120@xmath6 by 512@xmath6 ) .",
    "the eis observation started at 09:26:40 and lasted about 1 hour . during this time",
    "the 1@xmath6 slit was moved in steps of 2@xmath6 across the region with 60s exposures at each position .",
    "the eis data were reduced and processed in the same way as discussed previously .",
    "the aia data were obtained pre - processed from the level 1.5 cutout service .",
    "these data have had flat - fielding and dark current corrections applied .",
    "bad pixels and cosmic ray hits have also been repaired by an iterative method .",
    "we converted the data to dn / pixel / s .",
    "the images have also been rotated to solar north and shifted to match the sdo / hmi ( helioseismic and magnetic imager ) fov center so that they are all coaligned .",
    "nevertheless , we detected some small offsets between different filters and corrected this misalignment by cross - correlating the full disk images .",
    "coalignment of the eis and aia data was achieved by extracting the eis fov from the aia 131 full sun image and cross - correlating it with the 185.213 eis raster .",
    "due to the orbital variation of the position of the eis slit , the spatial sampling is not uniform across the raster .",
    "in contrast , the aia image is taken nearly instantaneously ( 2.9s exposure ) so there is negligible movement .",
    "therefore , the effective plate - scale magnification between the images is not uniform in the solar x - direction . for these observations this discrepancy amounted to 1@xmath6 across half the raster and",
    "was corrected manually .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows images from eis and aia of the eis fov . for this analysis we selected small boxes on each of 3 loops and averaged the intensities in these areas .",
    "the selected positions are shown in the figure as ea1 , ea2 , and ea3 .",
    "the background emission was estimated for each box by averaging the emission in the adjacent boxes ( also shown in the figure ) .",
    "single and multiple gaussian fits to the eis data were made as appropriate .",
    "the spectral line - list for these observations was smaller than that of the december 2007 region , but it still covered a sufficiently broad temperature range from @xmath32 = 5.5 to 6.4 .",
    "the selected lines are indicated in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "in addition , we included 184.117 , 276.579 , and 270.394 to provide further lower temperature constraints .",
    "the emission measure analysis is the same as that used in the previous section for consistency .",
    "since the background subtraction sometimes reduces the intensities of the density diagnostic lines to zero , we have assumed a density of @xmath33 = 9.5 in computing the emission measure for both eis and aia .",
    "this value is the average of that obtained along the loop analyzed in  [ fan_dem ] .",
    "we extracted intensities from the coaligned 131 , 171 , 193 , 211 , 335 , and 94 filters .",
    "these filters are expected to be dominated by lines of , , , , , and .",
    "the 94 filter also contains contributions from and which can dominate under certain conditions @xcite .",
    "we use only the intensities that correlate well with the 131 intensity for generating the emission measure distribution . in practise",
    ", this generally excludes the 335 and 94 bands where there is little emission for the fan loops we study .",
    "a photometric calibration uncertainty of 25% is used as the intensity error ( boerner et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the response functions were calculated for a grid of electron densities and temperatures spanning @xmath4 = 612 and @xmath5 = 48 .",
    "this was done by calculating isothermal spectra as a function of wavelength at each temperature and density , @xmath34 , using chianti v6.0.1 and the coronal abundances of @xcite .",
    "the spectra were then convolved with the effective areas for each filter , @xmath35 , and integrated in wavelength , @xmath36 , to obtain the response functions , @xmath37 .",
    "the effective areas were obtained from solarsoft .",
    "the em distributions computed from the eis data for ea1 , ea2 , and ea3 are shown in the top row of figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "the results computed from the aia data are shown in the second row .",
    "em loci curves are also shown to indicate the sensitivity of the eis lines and aia filters .",
    "table [ tab2 ] shows the peak temperature ( @xmath38 ) , emission measure ( @xmath39 ) , and gaussian width ( @xmath40 ) derived from eis and aia for each loop .",
    "the uncertainties in these parameters are also given .",
    "the two instruments agree that the peak temperatures of the loops are @xmath5 = 5.96.0 .",
    "the emission measure magnitudes are @xmath41 = 2627 and the eis and aia results are consistent to 2555% .",
    "the eis data indicate that one of the loops ( ea1 ) is isothermal and that the other two have a finite ( but narrow ) width , consistent with the findings for the loop in  [ fan_dem ] .",
    "the aia data yield similar results .",
    "for the two loops that are not isothermal , aia finds a slightly larger thermal width ( 0.14 in @xmath30 ) .",
    "this may be due to the coarser temperature resolution compared to eis .",
    "the uncertainties in all parameters from aia are also larger .",
    "note that an error of zero is returned in the isothermal case because the temperature becomes fixed .    again in figure [ fig8 ] we show the intensities of 185.213 and 275.368 as a function of temperature after convolution with the em distribution of each loop .",
    "in all three cases the two lines are effectively formed at the same temperature .",
    "we also investigated the effective response of the aia 131 filter after convolution with the eis emission measure distribution .",
    "the main contributing lines in this pass band at @xmath42 6.4 are 130.941 , and 131.240 .",
    "these produce the peak around @xmath5 = 5.7 in the usual response , @xmath43 ( dashed line in figure [ fig8 ] ) . the convolved function @xmath44 is plotted in figure [ fig8 ] as the solid line .",
    "note that the peak of the response shifts to higher temperatures after being convolved with the em distribution ; @xmath5 = 5.855.95 .",
    "this is consistent with the analysis in the previous sections and demonstrates that these effects can also be important for imager observations .",
    "motivated by the desire to study the temperature structure of active region fan loops we have attempted to resolve inconsistencies found in previous work using eis data . in particular , we have shown that the similarity in eis 185.213 and 275.368 images , that is not expected from the respective temperatures of peak abundance in ionization equilibrium , can be understood when a more accurate calculation of the effective formation temperature in the solar corona is performed .",
    "this is done by convolving the contribution functions with the dem of the target of interest .",
    "if the dem has a steep gradient in the @xmath5 = 5.65.8 range , or is sharply peaked , the two lines will be formed close in temperature . in this work ,",
    "we compared the effect of this technique on the formation temperatures of these lines in the quiet sun .",
    "the initial separation of @xmath5 = 5.65.8 is reduced to 5.755.85 , and it is clear that 185.213 has a substantial contribution from emitting material at @xmath5 = 5.8 .    to examine whether this explanation could work for the fan loops , we derived the em distribution along one example in ar 10978 .",
    "the temperature distribution peaks near 11.2mk and narrows along the loop .",
    "the peak contribution to the line intensity is @xmath5 = 5.9 for both the 185.213 and 275.368 lines . to investigate",
    "whether this effect is generally applicable to other ar fans , we examined a number of other loops .",
    "we found that in all cases the two lines are formed at the same temperature ( @xmath45 5.9 ) .",
    "this suggests therefore , that the expected difference in images of the fans formed from these lines is a result of an overestimation of the separation in formation temperatures by the approximate method of assuming the lines are formed at the temperature of the peak fractional abundance in ionization equilibrium .",
    "note that other lines may be affected in similar ways .",
    "for example , in figure [ fig1 ] the and images look different despite the fact that they have similar ionization equilibrium temperatures .",
    "we have verified that they are in fact formed at different temperatures in the fan loop of section [ ftarcfs ] .    to demonstrate the importance of understanding the formation of the euv spectrum for broad pass - band imagers we studied the effect of convolving the aia 131 response function with our eis fan loop em distributions .",
    "we showed that , as a result , the peak of the dominant lower temperature part of the effective response function shifts up to @xmath3 5.9 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that we have not shown that this explanation holds in general for all active areas or structures on the sun .",
    "if the dem slope is shallower ( or flat ) in the @xmath5 = 5.65.8 range then the 185.213 and 275.368 lines should still be formed at a wider separation in temperatures and examples of significantly different images should be found .",
    "the apparent lack of such observations for any solar feature , however , provides a stringent constraint on the gradient of the dem slope in this temperature range all over the sun .",
    "this is consistent with other independent studies that show strong similarities in the shape of the dem distribution in different areas of the quiet sun @xcite .",
    "the dem - gradient resolves the inconsistencies in formation temperatures between the and lines , but a related issue is that discrepancies have also been found in the magnitude of the intensities of these lines in previous dem studies using eis data .",
    "we showed here that these additional issues are resolved when the most recent ionization balance compilation data of @xcite are used for the atomic calculations . from this analysis , therefore , no substantive relative error in the fe ionization balance is indicated for the specific ions of and .",
    "this work has demonstrated that the strong 185.213 and 275.368 lines can be used with confidence for dem studies and velocity work in the transition region .",
    "therefore , we examined the temperature structure of a small sample of fan loops .",
    "we found that they have peak temperatures in the range 0.81.2mk .",
    "one loop was found to be isothermal , but more often the temperature distribution has a narrow width .",
    "this result is similar to that found by @xcite for ` warm ' active region loops .",
    "in one detailed case , the em distribution is found to broaden considerably towards the base .",
    "this could have implications for the location of the heating .",
    "we also found that the peak temperatures and emission measures derived from aia data are in agreement with those derived from eis .",
    "there is also agreement on whether the loops are isothermal or not .",
    "the aia analysis indicates a slightly larger thermal width than eis when the loops are not isothermal .",
    "this is possibly because the eis data contain observations from consecutive ionization stages of whereas the aia data only sample every second ionization stage .",
    "we would like to thank the anonymous referee for helping us to focus and clarify the paper .",
    "we also thank viggo hansteen and john mariska for helpful comments , and paul boerner and mark weber for providing the aia effective areas .",
