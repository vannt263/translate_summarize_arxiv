    "hard x - ray surveys are the most direct probe of supermassive black hole ( smbh ) accretion activity , which is recorded in the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , in wide ranges of smbh masses , down to @xmath3 , and bolometric luminosities , down to @xmath4 erg / s .",
    "x - ray surveys can therefore be used to : study the evolution of the accreting sources ; measure the smbh mass density ; constrain models for the cxb @xcite , and models for the formation and evolution of the structure in the universe @xcite .",
    "these studies have so far confirmed , at least qualitatively , the predictions of standard agn synthesis models for the cxb : the 2 - 10 kev cxb is mostly made by the superposition of obscured and unobscured agns ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "quantitatively , though , rather surprising results are emerging : a rather narrow peak in the range z=0.7 - 1 is present in the redshift distributions from ultra - deep chandra and xmm - newton pencil - beam surveys , in contrast to the broader maximum observed in previous shallower soft x - ray surveys made by rosat , and predicted by the above mentioned synthesis models .",
    "however , the optical identification of the faint sources in these ultra - deep surveys is rather incomplete , especially for the sources with very faint optical counterparts , i.e. sources with high x - ray to optical flux ratio ( x / o ) .",
    "indeed , the optical magnitude of @xmath5 of the sources , those having the higher x / o , is r@xmath6 , not amenable at present to optical spectroscopy .",
    "this limitation leads to a strong bias in ultra - deep chandra and xmm - newton surveys against agn highly obscured in the optical , i.e. against type 2 qsos , and in fact , only 10 type 2 qsos have been identified in the cdfn and cdfs samples @xcite . to help overcoming this problem",
    ", we are pursuing a large area , medium - deep surveys , the hellas2xmm serendipitous survey , which , using xmm - newton archival observations @xcite has the goal to cover @xmath7 deg@xmath8 at a 2 - 10 kev flux limit of a few@xmath9 . at this flux",
    "limit several sources with x / o@xmath1 have optical magnitudes r=24 - 25 , bright enough for reliable spectroscopic redshifts to be obtained with 10 m class telescopes .",
    "we have obtained , so far , optical photometric and spectroscopic follow - up of 122 sources in five xmm - newton fields , covering a total of @xmath10 deg@xmath8 ( the hellas2xmm ` 1df ' sample ) , down to a flux limit of f@xmath11 erg @xmath12 s@xmath13 .",
    "we found optical counterparts brighter than r@xmath14 within @xmath15 from the x - ray position in 116 cases and obtained optical spectroscopic redshifts and classification for 94 of these sources @xcite .",
    "the source breakdown includes : 61 broad line qso and seyfert 1 galaxies , and 33 _ optically obscured agn _",
    ", i.e. agn whose nuclear optical emission , is totally or strongly reduced by dust and gas in the nuclear region and/or in the host galaxy ( thus including objects with optical spectra typical of type 2 agns , emission line galaxies and early type galaxies , but with x - ray luminosity @xmath16 erg s@xmath13 ) .",
    "we have combined the hellas2xmm 1df sample with other deeper hard x - ray samples including the cdfn @xcite , lockman hole @xcite , and ssa13 @xcite samples , to collect a `` combined '' sample of 317 hard x - ray selected sources , 221 ( 70% ) of them identified with an optical counterpart whose redshift is available .",
    "the flux of the sources in the combined sample spans in the range @xmath17 and the source breakdown includes 113 broad line agn and 108 optically obscured agn .",

    "[ xos ] shows the x - ray ( 2 - 10 kev ) to optical ( r band ) flux ratio ( x / o ) as a function of the hard x - ray flux for the combined sample . about 20% of the sources have x / o@xmath1 , i.e ten times or more higher than the x / o typical of optically selected agn . at the flux limit of the hellas2xmm 1df sample several sources with x",

    "indeed , we were able to obtain spectroscopic redshifts and classification of 13 out of the 28 hellas2xmm 1df sources with x / o@xmath18 ; _ 8 of them are type 2 qso at z=0.7 - 1.8 _ , to be compared with the total of 10 type 2 qsos identified in the cdfn @xcite and cdfs @xcite .",
    "[ xolx ] show the x - ray to optical flux ratio as a function of the x - ray luminosity for broad line agn ( left panel ) and non broad line agn and galaxies ( central panel ) .",
    "while the x / o of the broad line agns is not correlated with the luminosity , a striking correlation between log(x / o ) and log(l@xmath19 ) is present for the obscured agn : higher x - ray luminosity , optically obscured agn tend to have higher x / o .",
    "a similar correlation is obtained computing the ratio between the x - ray and optical luminosities , instead of fluxes ( because the differences in the k corrections for the x - ray and optical fluxes are small in comparison to the large spread in x / o ) .",

    "/ o is roughly a ratio between the nuclear x - ray flux and the host galaxy starlight flux_. the right panel of figure [ xolx ] helps to understand the origin of the correlation between x / o and l@xmath19 . while the x - ray luminosity of the optically obscured agns spans about 4 decades , the host galaxy r band luminosity is distributed over less than one decade .",

    "we have obtained spectroscopic redshifts and classification of 13 out of the 28 hellas2xmm 1df sources with x / o@xmath1 : the majority of these sources ( 8) are type 2 qsos at z=0.7 - 1.8 , a fraction of type 2 qsos much higher than at lower x / o values .",
    "we find a strong correlation between x / o and the x - ray luminosity of optically obscured agn , x / o=10 corresponding to an ( average ) 2 - 10 kev luminosity of @xmath20 erg s@xmath13 .",
    "sources of this luminosity and flux @xmath21 , reachable in chandra and xmm - newton ultra - deep surveys , would be at z@xmath22 .",
