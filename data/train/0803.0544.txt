    "as brown dwarfs cool and pass through the l / t spectral class boundary , their spectral morphologies transition from red near - infrared ( nir ) colors of the l dwarf class , caused by condensate dust in their photospheres , to blue nir colors of the t dwarf class , where their photospheres are relatively clear of dust .",

    "a remarkable brightening in @xmath2-band ( @xmath7m@xmath8  1 ) from spectral types @xmath9t1@xmath0t5 , known as the @xmath2-band `` bump '' @xcite , has been noted .",
    "two withstanding mechanisms to explain this brightening have been suggested : ( 1 ) the `` patchy clouds '' model  proposed by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , suggesting that the break - up of clouds in the atmosphere allows hot flux from inner layers to emerge ( analogous to the 5 @xmath6 m hot spots of jupiter ) , and ( 2 ) the `` sudden downpour '' model  proposed by @xcite , suggesting that the dust clouds suddenly condense out due to an increase in sedimentation efficiency .",
    "recent studies of brown dwarf binaries have revealed that a fraction of the amplitude in this bump can be explained by systems appearing overluminous due to binarity ( i.e. , `` crypto - binarity '' ; @xcite ) ; however , some part of this brightening is intrinsic to the atmospheres as they cool .",
    "this was revealed by hst / wfpc2 imaging of 2mass j17281150 + 3948593ab ( hereafter 2mass 1728ab ) , the first 11.2 @xmath6 m flux reversal binary , which has a t dwarf secondary brighter in @xmath10-band but fainter in @xmath11-band than the mid - to late - type l dwarf primary @xcite .",

    "this corresponds to individual masses of @xmath928 and 22 m@xmath59 , @xmath939 and 31 m@xmath59 , and @xmath944 and 36 m@xmath59 for these respective ages .",
