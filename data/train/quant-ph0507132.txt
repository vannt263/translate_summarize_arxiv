    "systems with point interactions play an important role in quantum mechanics since they keep their exact solvability while describing real systems  @xcite .",
    "conception of point interactions in pseudo - hermitian quantum mechanics appeared in various works  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "the aim of present article is to describe spectral properties of one particle confined in infinite square well with two point interactions of imaginary strength .",
    "the corresponding time - less schrdinger equation reads h=(--i(x+a)+i(x - a))=e.[1]where @xmath2 acts on continuous functions from @xmath3 vanishing in @xmath4 and whose derivatives have an imaginary step @xmath5 denote direction in which we approach the point . ] . considering energy @xmath6 as a general complex number , following the standard procedure we arrive at the secular equation 2u+((4ua-2u)+2u-22ua)=0,[2]where @xmath7 is defined as @xmath8 .",
    "invariance of the equation with respect to complex conjugation of its root was rather expected due to the @xmath9-pseudo hermiticity of the hamiltonian ( @xmath10 ) . due to the lack of physically relevant interpretation for non - real eigenvalues @xmath6",
    ", we will be interested in real energies only . in that case , (",
    "[ 2 ] ) acquires the following simplified form ,    2k+2ka^2 k(1-a)=0 ,  k = im(u).[3]neither ( [ 2 ] ) nor ( [ 3 ] ) can be solved without numerical methods . before presentation of numerical solution , we will focus on qualitative properties of ( [ 3 ] ) that can be derived analytically .",
    "performing a formal manipulation , the equation ( [ 3 ] ) can be rewritten , ^2=-.[5]in ( [ 1 ] ) , we required @xmath11 to be non - negative real number .",
    "it restricts the domain of @xmath12 since the right - hand side of ( [ 5 ] ) must be positive .",
    "let us take the following set = ( j_a^+i^-)(j_a^-i^+)m,[6]where @xmath13 assuming that @xmath14 , we define @xmath11 to be equal to its limit in the points where @xmath15 .",
    "then the function @xmath12 is continuous on the open interval @xmath16 . if @xmath17 , equation ( [ 3 ] ) is fulfilled for any real @xmath11 .",
    "let us discuss now the behavior of @xmath11 at the boundaries of the subintervals of @xmath18 .",
    "the numerator @xmath19 equals zero in one boundary point at least .",
    "it is due to @xmath20 and @xmath21 in this case .",
    "we will say that the boundary point is of the first type . on the other hand when @xmath22 vanishes",
    ", @xmath11 tends to infinity and the boundary is of the second type .",
    "thus , we can observe three kinds of spectral lines .",
    "the first one is supported by an interval from @xmath23 with both boundaries of the first type .",
    "it reaches its maximum @xmath24 on the interval so it is bounded .",
    "the spectral lines of the second type tend to infinity and are supported by subintervals of @xmath25 with mixed types of boundaries .",
    "the third kind is unbounded as well and is supported by @xmath17",
    ". that are semi - lines perpendicular to @xmath26-axes . in terminology used in @xcite , the energy levels of the first type are called * fragile * while the remaining ones are * robust * ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    the third class of spectral lines corresponds to wave functions having nodes at the interaction points and it appears only for rational @xmath27 . on two intervals @xmath28 that are connected by @xmath17 , spectral lines of the first and the third kind",
    "are stuck together .",
    "we speak about * unavoided level crossing * in this case . due to simple form of ( [ 5 ] )",
    ", the level crossing can be described quantitatively .",
    "let us take @xmath29 where @xmath9 and @xmath30 are coprime integers .",
    "the level crossing appears if @xmath31 and @xmath32 is odd number , @xmath33 is integer . in that case , the crossing of spectral lines occurs for @xmath34    the above analysis provided us a qualitative knowledge about behavior of @xmath35 implicitly given by ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "the fragile spectral lines cease to be real when @xmath11 exceeds a critical value @xmath24 .",
    "thus for any @xmath27 , we can find a sequence of the critical couplings @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the excitation of the higher energy from the couple of merging energy levels .",
    "the sequences of critical couplings have their minimum @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "it is an interesting feature of our model that the sequence is not monotonic .",
    "we call it * an overstepping complexification * of energy levels ( see fig 2 . ) .",
    "the numerical solution @xmath35 of ( [ 2 ] ) in the supercritical regime is in fig.3 .",
    "the presented model of a particle captured in an infinite square well with two point @xmath0-symmetric interactions  ( [ 1 ] ) offers an interesting spectral behavior .",
    "we studied a parametric dependence of energy levels on a position and strength of the point impurities .",
    "the analysis provided us a good qualitative control over various phenomena appearing in the spectrum .",
    "we described presence of fragile and robust spectral lines as well as appearance of unavoided level crossing of energy levels .",
    "these analytical observations were supported by numerical results . in the numerically obtained data",
    ", we observed a new phenomenon of `` overstepping '' complexification where merging of energy levels is not sequent with respect to the excitation but proceeds at random .",
    "the article is a continuation of research started in @xcite . in this sense , it is straightforward to find perturbation series for energy in the case of generic @xmath27 . it has been shown that for @xmath40 , the effect of non - hermitian interaction was negligible for high excitations .",
    "this fact enables approximate separability of positive - definite metric performed originally in @xcite and consequent computation of physically relevant quantities like position expectation value and its time development .",
