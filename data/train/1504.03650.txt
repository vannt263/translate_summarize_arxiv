    "as such , this study addresses the link between spatial symmetry and spin properties , and the possible tuning of the geometrical phase by varying the intensity and/or orientation of an external magnetic field .    to this end , we use an effective mass description of the conduction band , and incorporate the effects of confinement asymmetry for electrons in a realistic nanoring , as well as the resulting rashba spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) fields arising from confinement and external fields . by studying spin maps for angle and magnetic field intensities , we gain insights into the competition between different energy scales and how they impact the berry phase associated with each electronic state . as level mixing",

    "there are pronounced spatial asymmetry effects in the angular momentum and spin character of different states , as one would expect .",
    "these asymmetries , introduced or enhanced by shape anisotropies and confinement potential in the rings , are found to play an important role in determining the berry phase of the different states .",

    "[ fig2](b)-(d ) ) or against ( fig.[fig2](e)-(g ) ) the magnetic field , as the zeeman energy dominates over the soc .",
    "the evolution of spin orientation for each level is strongly influenced by the anticrossings with other levels , as one would expect .",

    ", the spin hybridization and phase modulation are intrinsically linked due to soc and magnetic field .",
    "spin orientation and phase values smoothly change as a function of magnetic field intensity ( or magnetic field orientation in fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "some apparently sudden spin - flips also appear , as the one highlighted in panel [ fig2](c ) , corresponding to a steep ( yet continuous ) variation of the spin component , as detailed in the inset .",
    "similar smooth variations are presented for an eccentric ( elliptically deformed ) ring on the right panels , fig.[fig2](j)-(o ) .",
    "the main effect introduced by the confinement asymmetry is to make the spin modulation and berry phase vary more gradually with field intensity .",
    "this can be understood as arising from the asymmetry which introduces mixing of different angular momentum components and associated anticrossings .",
    "notice in fig .",
    "[ fig2](i ) , that at higher magnetic fields , b@xmath686 t , various levels mix .",
    "this can be seen in the large anticrossings between levels 2 and 3 at around 7 t , levels 4 and 5 at around 6.7 t , and levels 5 and 6 at around 8.5 t .",
    "the level mixture makes the spectrum flatter with field and , correspondingly , produces weaker variations in the berry phase as well .",
    "figure [ fig2](h ) displays the gradual cumulative process of adding berry phases of the first 2 , 4 , and 6 consecutive levels of panels ( b)-(g ) .",
    "a similar addition has been obtained for the asymmetric ring case , shown in fig . [",
    "fig2](p ) .",
    "this additive process is equivalent to increasing electron number or window around the fermi level in a transport experiment ) .",
    "the cumulative berry phase , especially for large number ( @xmath69 ) of levels counted is essentially null ( or @xmath70 ) .",
    "in fact , although individual levels show strong variation of the berry phase with field , the cumulative phase does not : successive levels have compensating berry phase changes , so that the cumulative effect is surprisingly near null ( except for occasional @xmath71 slips shown in the figure ) , especially for the 4 and 6-level traces shown .",
    "the introduction of quantum ring eccentricity changes the situation in a somewhat subtle fashion . comparing left ( h ) and right ( p )",
    "panels in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , it is clear that as the eccentricity induces changes in the electronic spectrum and single - state berry phases , the cumulative berry phase shows gradual modulation , so that nontrivial values are seen over finite - size windows in field : 2 - 3 t and 7 - 9 t for cumulative berry phase of 2 levels ; 0 - 1 t and 6 - 7 t , for 4 levels ; and 3 - 4 t and 5 - 6 t , for 6 levels .",
    "this would suggest that a moderate degree of asymmetry and/or disorder unavoidably present in real systems may in fact produce a more robust berry phase signal in experiments .",
    "similar contrasts exist between circularly symmetric and asymmetric rings as function of magnetic field orientation ( at constant strength ) , as shown in fig.[fig3 ] . as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , each state shows a gradual berry phase evolution with magnetic field angle near level anticrossings , and the diamagnetic shift provided by @xmath26 decreases for larger angles .",
    "one can also see a rather interesting evolution of the spin orientation as the tilt angle increases .",
    "on the left panels , for the circularly symmetric ring , one also notices relatively sharp changes in berry phase and spin orientation , as different angular momentum components are mixed by spin orbit coupling .",
    "those jumps or drastic changes disappear or become smoother for the asymmetric ring ( right panels ) , as the eccentricity mixes more strongly the different angular momentum states .",
    "panels ( h ) and ( p ) show the cumulative berry phase for the two rings .",
    "there is a similar behavior already seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] : a smooth variation with angle for small number of levels , changes to essentially null phase value ( @xmath72 ) for larger level number .",
    "the sudden phase slips however become smoother , resulting in nontrivial values for the asymmetric ring over wider range ( angular in this case ) .",

    "berry phases for different states in both rings are shown in the panels below .",
    "the cumulative berry phase for different occupations is shown in panels ( h ) and ( p ) , for the symmetric and asymmetric rings , respectively . ]",
    "the slow evolution of berry phase for each state signals the mixtures introduced by the different perturbations on an otherwise highly - symmetric picture .",
    "the zeeman field , soc , and structural asymmetries produce simultaneous mixtures of spin , parity , and angular momentum .",
    "this effect , contained in the expansion coefficients of the different states , can be visualized as well through spin density maps .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] , left panels , show the expansion coefficients for the four lowest energy states of an asymmetric ring , as function of magnetic field , at a fixed angle @xmath18 .",
    "these panels show solid ( dashed ) curves for the spin up ( down ) components with different angular momentum @xmath73 in the given state .",
    "the states are mixtures of angular momentum ( introduced at zero field by the ring asymmetry ) and/or spin ( due to soc ) , which evolve with field to other components ( due to the diamagnetic shift of the spectrum ) , and eventually to more complex mixtures at higher energies .    the right panels in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] show spin vector maps for the corresponding state at the field @xmath16 t , and @xmath18 .",
    "this field value corresponds to the anticrossing between the second and third levels in fig.[fig2](i ) .",
    "the vector maps use arrows with size proportional to the spin density at each point on the plane ( integrating each expression in eq . (",
    "15 ) on the @xmath14-coordinate ) and blue ( or red ) colors to indicate a positive ( or negative ) sign of the @xmath14-spin component at that point .",
    "the ground state ( level 1 ) shows a spin map predominantly on the plane , although with overall positive @xmath74 component , and with high amplitude near the ends of the long - axis ellipse .",
    "the first - excited state , in contrast , shows large negative @xmath74 components and with a spatial distribution that complements that of the ground state .",
    "one also notices that the ground state spin map shows local vectors that are essentially parallel all along the ring : this would result in a vanishing berry phase , as it is indeed seen in fig .",

    "[ fig4 ] are canted with respect to those a quarter of the way along the ring .",
    "it is this non - parallel nature of the spins along the ring structure that characterizes a non - vanishing berry phase .",
    "levels 3 and 4 show even more structure , with spin vector amplitude more localized near the long ends of the ellipse , but with @xmath74 component that changes sign as one moves along the ring .",
    "the relative twisting of the spin vector density along the ring , contributes to the non - vanishing berry phase seen in fig .",

    "blue arrows have a positive projection along @xmath14 , while for red arrows the projection is negative .",
    "notice nearly parallel vectors in level 1 result in a null berry phase ; in contrast , canting of vectors in level 2 contribute to a berry phase of @xmath75 ( see fig .  [ fig2](k ) ) . ]",
    "we have used a nearly analytical description of the states in quantum rings of finite width .",
    "this model , used before to describe realistic structures in experiments , allows us to extract interesting insights on the role of spin - orbit coupling and its interplay with external magnetic field effects , such as diamagnetic shifts and zeeman splitting .",
    "we have moreover introduced asymmetry in the confinement structure to see how this affects the level structure and associated spin texture and berry phase of different states .",
    "we observed that possible experimental sweeps of magnetic field tilt or amplitude , produce controllable changes in the state characteristics , which can be traced in particular through the smooth variation of the berry phase of each state .",
    "it is also clear that as spin - orbit coupling could be made stronger with applied electric fields , the rashba effect would also controllably change the overall geometric phase in quantum rings .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , we found that the unavoidable defects or asymmetries in ring confinement produce smooth changes in the berry phase , as either the magnetic field or tilt ( or even rashba field ) is changed .",
    "this effect makes the otherwise sudden phase slips in symmetric rings become smoother and produce non - vanishing ( or nontrivial ) geometric phases as a consequence .",
    "this would suggest that moderate level mixing makes for more robust berry phases in experiments .",
    "one should also comment , that although the multilevel cumulative berry phase appears essentially null for higher level number ( or wider energy window ) , it may be possible to access individual ( or few ) state berry phases in narrow bias ranges or similar other experiments where few states can be sampled .",
