    "light propagation through our universe is generally treated in two separate regimes : either within the smooth friedmann - robertson - walker model or within the gravitational lensing model of density inhomogeneities ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the actual universe both local inhomogeneities and global homogeneity",
    "exist , so each acts as an asymptotic description under the appropriate conditions . along with image amplifications , distortions , and time delays ,",
    "the source distance - redshift relation is also affected by inhomogeneities .",
    "while many researchers discuss the distance relations in the presence of inhomogeneities , e.g.  futamase & sasaki ( 1989 ) , watanabe & tomita ( 1990 ) , and how ignorance of clumpiness can affect determination of cosmological parameters by distance tests , e.g.  linder ( 1988a ) , hadrovi & binney ( 1997 ) , the question of the nature of the transition region between the two regimes is not addressed .",
    "it is of importance to understand where this transition occurs so as to use the two limiting cases only where they are valid approximations .    for almost all astrophysical applications of light propagation geometric optics",
    "holds , where the curvature or inhomogeneity scales are much greater than the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation , so the radiation can be treated as a beam or bundle of light rays .",
    "the focusing of the bundle due to the spacetime geometry determines the angular diameter distance @xmath2 by    d^2r / d^2=-(r+||^2)r , [ eqn : beam ] where @xmath3 is the affine parameter measuring the path length , @xmath4 is the ricci contribution of the gravitational focusing from matter within the beam , and @xmath5 is the weyl contribution of gravitational shear from matter outside the beam . here",
    "@xmath6 is the ricci tensor and @xmath7 the photon four momentum .    to obtain a universal , i.e.  isotropic , distance relation , equation ( [ eqn : beam ] )",
    "is generally solved under the `` average path '' assumption ( @xcite ) for an infinitesimal light beam , e.g.  a single ray .",
    "this posits that the matter density along the line of sight is given by the global average density times a uniform smoothness parameter @xmath8 , measuring the degree of small scale inhomogeneity or clumpiness , and that the shear vanishes from global homogeneity .",
    "this approximation substitutes for detailed knowledge of the locally inhomogeneous metric , or physical conditions , along the light path , which we generally lack .",
    "given that ignorance some such effective model must be adopted , with the main caution being insurance that a `` typical '' path is indeed characteristic of the average .",
    "as the light beam subtends larger and larger solid angles , at some point the inhomogeneities should be smoothed over and we can legitimately calculate distances within the cosmology .",
    "the question arises how to connect these two asymptotic behaviors with a reasonable , preferably simple analytic model .",
    "( one can of course use numerical ray shooting within a specific pattern of inhomogeneities to compute the distance relations but they will be relation_s _ , not one single universal relation as desired . ) of particular observational interest is how large is the transition angle , as many cosmological tests such as the number - redshift and magnitude - redshift relations are sensitive to the precise distance measure .",
    "the standard model for density inhomogeneities when calculating cosmological distance relations is the dyer - roeder prescription : distribute randomly a fraction @xmath9 of the total matter density in clumps , point masses @xmath10 with constant comoving number density @xmath11 .",
    "light rays passing too close to a clump will be appreciably gravitationally influenced ( spatially deflected , cross sectionally sheared , intensity amplified ) and so will be recognized as something special and not treated as being on a typical line of sight .",
    "that leaves those paths avoiding clumps , but their neighborhoods only possess a matter density of @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the global average matter density .",
    "thus , an `` average '' path does not feel the full ( frw ) density and the calculated angular diameter distance @xmath14 will differ from the frw relation @xmath15 . in this case @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the source redshift .",
    "[ one can also generalize the model to redshift dependent clumpiness @xmath18 , modeling the effects of evolving inhomogeneity , clump mass , or number density ( @xcite ) .",
    "note that this brings up an interesting point .",
    "if we lived in a local inhomogeneity , either a bubble of different density or different clumpiness , then even though the volume averaged universe would appear friedmann , our observed distance - redshift relation would not be the same as in that volume averaged universe . it does not asymptotically approach the friedmann result even at distances much greater than the bubble size .",
    "i.e.  the observer is in a special position and volume rather than angle ( line of sight ) averaging may give misleading results ; one can not invoke an ergodic homogeneity because our position as observers selects a unique location .",
    "such an isotropic inhomogeneity would lead to an apparent conflict between cosmological parameters derived from dynamical quantities and those involving the distance - redshift relation ( in preparation ) . ]",
    "given the dyer - roeder ansatz , one can see that as a light beam subtends a larger solid angle , the probability increases that it will include a clump .",
    "this raises the matter density within the beam and when the bundle is broad enough it will feel the full frw density . to investigate this transition",
    "consider a beam with half angle @xmath19 at the observer , propagating from a redshift @xmath17 .",
    "let each clump own a conical volume @xmath20 given by    ndv_c=1 , [ eqn : volc ] which extends from the observer out to the source or survey depth @xmath17 with half angle @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath22 is the proper number density ; note the subscript @xmath23 on the proper volume element @xmath24 denotes `` clump '' not `` comoving '' .",
    "the probability that the light beam will include the clump is given by the poisson process    p()=1-e^- ( ) , [ eqn : prob ] where the optical depth @xmath25 .",
    "that is , on average a beam covering @xmath20 has roughly unity probability for including the clump ( really @xmath26 because of statistical fluctuations in the number density ) .    although as the beam expands , i.e.  @xmath19 increases , the matter within the beam actually jumps in a step function , as the next step in our ansatz we simulate the global averaging by choosing an effective smoothed density @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the global smoothness parameter , i.e.  that felt by an infinitesimal ray .",
    "so rather than having no clump within the beam then suddenly all of it , we smoothly add its contribution according to the probability for inclusion @xmath29 .",
    "this is the main approximation we make in order to talk about a universal distance function .",
    "it seems physically reasonable and is well behaved mathematically .",
    "the effective smoothness parameter is now    ( , z)=|+(1-| ) .",

    "we adopt @xmath36 , which would cause the greatest deviation of the clumpy vs.  smooth frw model .",
    "note that the approximation in ( [ eqn : aapx ] ) ( solid curve ) has removed the need for recursion in determining @xmath37 .",
    "because the ratio of @xmath38 s is insensitive to @xmath8 the approximation is excellent : the fully recursed @xmath8 differs from @xmath39 by at most @xmath40 for the extreme case of @xmath41 , @xmath42 ( and is more typically @xmath43 )  and this occurs in a region of parameter space such that the distance @xmath44 is never more than @xmath45 from @xmath46 .    the resulting @xmath37 has the pleasing properties of monotonicity , simplicity , and the proper asymptotic behaviors : as @xmath19 increases the parameter goes from @xmath47 to @xmath48 , i.e.  we have effectively introduced an averaging procedure that provides the dyer - roeder clumpy universe result at small angles , the frw result at large angles , and defines the transition .    to find the transition angle @xmath21 combine equations ( [ eqn : volc ] ) and ( [ eqn : volr ] ) to get    1=2n_0_0^_cd_z dr_p(1+z)^3r^2 [ ( ) ]",

    "[ eqn : thcval ] at low @xmath17 or high smoothness @xmath53 the clump angle formally becomes large but this is unphysical given our interpretation of @xmath21 as a transition angle to frw behavior . a more physical transition angle @xmath54 is defined as that angle where @xmath55 first differs from @xmath56 by less than 5% .",
    "figure 2 plots both @xmath54 and @xmath21 vs.  @xmath17 . for low @xmath17",
    "the distances @xmath2 are insensitive to @xmath8 ( it enters at third order in an expansion of @xmath2 in @xmath17 ; see @xcite ) so even for @xmath57 all @xmath44 are close to @xmath56 . for high redshifts @xmath21 and @xmath54 formally diverge as @xmath58 due respectively to the scarcity of clumps and to the difference in high @xmath17 asymptotic behavior between smooth and even slightly clumpy distances .",
    "the growth is extremely slow , however , @xmath59 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "realistically , @xmath28 evolves due to structure formation such that it approaches unity sufficiently closely ( e.g. @xmath63 for @xmath64 ) that @xmath65 at high redshifts .",
    "thus , in general distant source observations with fields of view larger than a few arcseconds can legitimately be treated within the frw model for distances .    as a definite example , consider the volume - redshift cosmological test which involves the angular diameter distance ( note the luminosity and proper motion distances are simply related to the angular diameter distance by factors of @xmath66 ) . from equation ( [ eqn : volr ] ) the volume - redshift relation is    v()=v_frw()[g(z,)/g(z,1 ) ] , [ eqn : volz ] where @xmath67 .",
    "for @xmath68 the ratio of @xmath38 factors is close to unity , and for @xmath69 we observe at @xmath70 ( larger than arcsecond fields ) and so @xmath71 and again @xmath72 .",
    "thus clumpiness effects are negligible in this case .",
    "the differential volume test is more sensitive since this does not possess the integration in equation ( [ eqn : volr ] ) that includes those very low redshifts where @xmath2 is nearly independent of @xmath8 ( as discussed above ) . then    v()/v_frw()= 2 ^ -2_0^ dr^2[()]/r^2(1 ) .",
    "[ eqn : difv ] the ratio is bounded between @xmath73 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath74 ^ 2 $ ] and can approach @xmath75 at @xmath76 as @xmath77 if @xmath37 were unreasonably pushed to zero .",
    "the deviation from unity is less than @xmath78 for all redshifts and clumpiness factors , however , when @xmath79 .",
    "in particular , this assures us that the usual observations can be analyzed properly using the frw volume element : for example the loh - spillar ( 1986 ) fields were @xmath80 at @xmath81 .",
    "( see @xcite for how the clumpy luminosity distance affects the analysis of flux weighted counts . )",
    "clumpy and transition regimes can be important , however , for cosmological tests involving arcsecond scales .",
    "possible applications include observations of radio galaxy lobes ( @xcite , @xcite ) and milliarcsecond observations of active galactic nuclei ( @xcite ) for use in the angular diameter distance - redshift cosmological test . at a redshift of two , for example , the difference between the clumpy and smooth angular diameter distances for @xmath36 is @xmath82 , and a clumpy flat model gives the same distance as a smooth model with @xmath1 .",
    "figure 3 shows this trade off between clumpiness in a @xmath36 model and low density in a smooth model .",
    "thus a flat but clumpy universe could be misinterpreted through small angular scale observations as a lower density one . in general",
    "one can match a distance in a ( @xmath8,@xmath83 ) universe with a ( @xmath84,@xmath85 ) model .",
    "the numbers on the plotted curves give the angular scale of the observations in arcseconds and show the transition in clumpiness or alternatively density miscalculation from the infinitesimal case ( dyer - roeder ) to the large scale average ( frw ) .",
    "one point remains of which we must be cautious . the @xmath86 term in equation ( [ eqn : beam ] ) was treated by using an effective smoothed density but we neglected the shear term @xmath87 . on large scales",
    "we expect the shear to average to zero due to homogeneity but this is not ensured at smaller scales : if the light passes far from the clump then the shear on the bundle should be small , but not if it passes near the clump .",
    "we can analyze this in terms of an effective clumpiness defined through equation ( [ eqn : beam ] ) by    _",
    "eff=-(2/3)||^2h_0 ^ -2 ^ -1(1+z)^-5 , [ eqn : aeff ] where @xmath88 is the ratio of the total density to the critical density .",
    "then the right hand side of equation ( [ eqn : beam ] ) can be written simply as @xmath89 and the previous results hold with the substitution of @xmath90 for @xmath8 .",
    "note that shear always decreases @xmath90  brings it further from the frw value of unity  and so increases the transition angle @xmath21 ( more properly decreases the ratio @xmath91 for which @xmath90 is a given value ) . also note that @xmath90 can be negative , which causes no mathematical worries [ it merely makes the usual parameter @xmath92 .",
    "alternately , we can solve the full beam equation ( [ eqn : beam ] ) .",
    "because the shear squared source term of a point mass dies off as @xmath93 , we can approximate its behavior as localized in affine parameter , say between @xmath94 and @xmath95 . dividing the light propagation from source at @xmath96 to observer at 0 into three regimes @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99",
    ", we match the values of @xmath2 and its first derivative at the boundaries . for the most extreme case , @xmath100 and @xmath36 , the solutions to the distance relations",
    "are : @xmath101 ; @xmath102 yields    @xmath103 ,   \\label{eqn : rsig}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "thus the shear only has a significant effect on the angular diameter distance relation if the second term is nonnegligible .",
    "the maximum shear on the beam is given in order of magnitude by @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the impact parameter from the mass @xmath10 .",
    "for @xmath107 equal to the einstein radius of the mass , @xmath108 where the @xmath2 s are respectively measured from observer to source , observer to lens mass , and lens to source .",
    "the maximum value of the ratio of the second to first terms in equation ( [ eqn : rsig ] ) is then @xmath109 , meaning that when concerned with distances we can neglect shear for beams passing outside the einstein ring of the mass .",
    "so we argue that we can neglect the influence of shear on distances overall because 1 ) narrow beams ( @xmath110 ) would typically miss the einstein ring because their probability for intersection ( @xmath111 ) is small ( e.g. @xmath112 for @xmath113 ) ; 2 ) those few appreciably sheared light beams would be recognized as atypical and not used for distance measures ; and 3 ) broad beams would have any shear effects diluted due to those portions of the beam that lie far from the clump and those symmetric ( isotropic ) about it .",
    "therefore we do not expect shear to alter significantly the distance - redshift relation for a typical light bundle , except possibly at high redshifts where the transition scale @xmath21 is below an arcsecond ( and so @xmath114 ) and hence below the region of observational interest .",
    "using a simple toy model of an effective density distribution due to inhomogeneities one can derive a universal angular diameter distance relation applicable over all angular scales .",
    "it has the desired asymptotic properties : agreeing for small solid angles with the clumpy universe dyer - roeder distance , recreating for large solid angle observations the friedmann - robertson - walker relation , and interpolating smoothly between them .",
    "the transition angle depends on the type of inhomogeneities but is estimated to be unlikely to exceed @xmath115 for any cosmological test and should be of order @xmath116 for any quantities involving the entire light propagation path between the source and observer .",
    "still , this can have significant effects on such relations as the angular diameter - redshift relation for radio galaxies and agns , for example a true clumpy flat universe mimicking a smooth open model , and must be looked for in such cosmological tests ."
