    "the high - harmonic radiation emitted from these molecules contains information which may be used for , e.g. , orbital tomography @xcite , probing of nuclear dynamics with sub - fs resolution @xcite , and following coupled electron - nuclear dynamics with time - resolved high - harmonic spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "noteworthy , already the electrons emitted by ionization ( seen as the first step of high - harmonic generation ) contain structural information suitable for orbital imaging @xcite .",
    "moreover , a process termed lochfra  allows to create nuclear wave packets in neutral molecules and to measure them with sub - femtosecond and sub - ngstrm resolution adopting a pump - probe scheme @xcite .    in view of the many promising proposals a deeper understanding of the molecular response",
    "to intense , ultrashort laser fields is desirable . compared to atoms , the nuclear degrees of freedom ( vibration and rotation ) as well as the multi - centered ( non - spherically symmetric ) electronic structure of molecules increase the complexity regarding their theoretical treatment .",
    "thus , even molecular hydrogen h@xmath0 , despite being the simplest neutral molecule , remains a great challenge for theory when exposed to intense laser fields .",

    "thus , at first , perturbative one - photon ionization @xcite ( and references therein ) and later on two- to four - photon ionization @xcite of h@xmath0 have been studied .",
    "the direct numerical solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) describing h@xmath0 in intense laser fields for fixed nuclei and a parallel alignment was first realized on a sophisticated grid @xcite and then using a configuration - interaction expansion built from h@xmath1 orbitals expressed in prolate spheroidal coordinates @xcite . in the perturbative regime , good quantitative agreement between lopt and tdse ionization yields has been found @xcite .",
    "this latter approach has also been applied , e.g. , for longer wavelengths and higher intensities as well as for non - parallel orientations of the laser polarization with respect to the molecular axis @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that a simplified treatment using the molecular strong - field approximation ( in velocity gauge ) can contradict the behavior obtained from the direct tdse solution even qualitatively .    in a different approach based on an expansion in born - oppenheimer eigenstates and a single - center expansion for the electronic problem ,",
    "the tdse has been solved accounting also for vibrational dynamics @xcite ( neglecting non - adiabatic couplings ) .",
    "large differences between the treatment that included the vibrational dynamics and the fixed - nuclei approximation were found @xcite .",
    "later applications of this approach concentrated mainly on low laser intensities and studied , e.g. , the decay of autoionizing states @xcite .",
    "another , more recently introduced approach , again using prolate spheroidal coordinates but laguerre and legendre polynomials as basis functions , has been applied to investigate enhanced ionization occurring at large internuclear distances @xcite .    in the following section , the method to solve the two - electron tdse and the basis - set parameters used are briefly discussed . in section  [ sec : perturbative ] , the method is applied in the perturbative multiphoton regime and compared to the results in refs .  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the breakdown of the widely used fixed - nuclei approximation is re - investigated in detail with the present approach .",
