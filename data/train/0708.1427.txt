    "the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) in the cores of the most x - ray luminous clusters of galaxies are the most massive galaxies in the universe .",
    "their unusually extended stellar envelopes , high optical luminosities , and red colors pose a challenge to models of galaxy formation , which , conversely , predict that the brightest cluster galaxies should be even more luminous than observed and should be blue , not red @xcite . according to such models , galaxies at the centers of clusters should be highly luminous and blue because supernova feedback is unable to prevent runaway cooling , condensation , and star formation in the gas at the center of a cluster .",
    "however , even though the galaxies at the centers of x - ray luminous clusters are red , spitzer multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ) imaging of moderate redshift ( @xmath5 ) clusters with cool cores and large h@xmath3 luminosities has revealed that they can still be surprisingly luminous infrared sources , @xmath6 erg s@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "their mid - infrared luminosity turns out to be @xmath8 times the total x - ray luminosity from the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) , and puts these galaxies in the same luminosity class as lirgs ( luminous infrared galaxies . )",
    "historically , clusters in which the central gas radiates enough energy to cool and condense within a hubble time have been categorized as cooling - flow clusters .",
    "such clusters exhibit highly peaked x - ray fluxes and , usually , icm temperature gradients that decrease into the cluster core .",
    "cool core clusters are rather common at @xmath9 , accounting for @xmath10 of the x - ray luminous population , indicating that this phase is not short lived .",
    "yet , the central gas in these clusters does not appear to be cooling and condensing at the rates implied by naive interpretations of x - ray imaging data , which could exceed 100 m@xmath11 .",
    "central star formation rates are much lower than this , and the central galaxies do not appear to contain the @xmath12 of cold gas that should have collected over a hubble time .",
    "this was the notorious `` cooling flow '' problem : how can these systems be so common , when there is no obvious source of heat to replenish the energy these systems radiate so quickly ?",
    "high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy has given the cooling - flow problem an additional twist by showing that most of the x - ray gas with a short cooling time does not even cool below @xmath13k .",
    "hot gas is detected at a range of temperatures down to @xmath14 of the virial temperature but does not appear to emit at lower temperatures .",
    "this result confirms that the gas condensation rates in these systems are not very large but does nt explain what suppresses cooling .",
    "recent chandra x - ray observations have suggested that agn feedback might be what inhibits cooling in cluster cores , because some ( but not all ) cooling flow clusters host central agn which excavate kpc - scale cavities in the icm ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "still more clusters exhibit elevated central entropy levels which may have been produced by a now - inactive agn @xcite .",
    "there is increasing support for the idea that the central agn is the culprit providing the  extra \" heating , not only countering radiative cooling in cluster cores , but also providing a self - regulating feedback mechanism in massive galaxies in general ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these observations and theories have sparked a renewed interest in the role of agn in the formation of galaxies , and in particular , their role in heating the icm and stifling star formation .",
    "interestingly , the mechanism that counteracts uninhibited radiative cooling in cluster cores does not appear to shut off star formation altogether .",
    "cooler gas is not completely absent in the central galaxies , a few of which have substantial quantities ( @xmath15 m@xmath16 ) of molecular gas at a range of temperatures .",
    "extended , vibrationally - excited h@xmath17 2-micron emission lines have been detected in these sources @xcite , and about @xmath18 m@xmath16 of cold molecular hydrogen has been inferred from co observations in many of these systems . if some of the icm cools and forms stars , that could explain why most cool core systems exhibit luminous optical emission - line nebulae , which in turn nearly always accompany the presence of molecular gas .",
    "such nebulae produce bright h@xmath3 and forbidden line emission @xcite .",
    "emission - line spectroscopy suggests that at least some of the emission can be explained as the result of photoionization and heating by hot stars @xcite .",
    "tantalizing possible detections by fuse of million degree gas , via ovi emission , suggest that at least some of the gas does cool below x - ray emitting temperatures @xcite . however , the interpretation of such spectra is complicated , sometimes by the presence of a low - luminosity agn and possibly by slow shocks or heating by cosmic rays or local x - rays .    in this paper",
    ", we present spitzer observations of mid - infrared emission from the bcg in abell 2597 , a nearby cool - core cluster , that address an important question about the cool - core phenomenon : what is the dusty star formation rate in this cluster ?",
    "these data also stimulate new questions about the star formation in bcgs : ( 1 ) is the infrared emission from a bcg in a cool - core cluster typical of a starburst in a spiral galaxy ? ( 2 ) is the dust spectrum characteristic of relatively unprocessed milky way - type dust that has been transported to the center of the bcg during a merger , or is it consistent with the dust having been recently exposed to the harsh environment of the intracluster medium ? ( 3 ) if a modest amount of gas is condensing from the icm , is the condensation rate consistent with the observed star - formation activity and molecular gas content ?",
    "our spitzer observations show that the ir spectrum of this bcg is fairly typical of a normal starburst , with a far - ir peak at @xmath1970@xmath1 m and a mid - ir excess consistent with emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) .",
    "the star formation rate implied by the ir and uv emission from this galaxy are also consistent with observational limits on the cooling and condensation rate of gas from the central icm . in our analysis , we assume @xmath20 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 cosmology . at the redshift of the bcg in a2597",
    "( @xmath23 , @xcite ) the scale is 1.551 kpc arcsec@xmath7 .",
    "the brightest cluster galaxy in abell 2597 ( abell richness class 0 ) contains a well - studied fri radio source pks2322 - 12 and is conveniently positioned in region of the sky with very low galactic extinction ( @xmath24 mag ; @xcite ) , confirmed by @xcite .",
    "the optical spectrum of the central galaxy was studied intensively by @xcite , who placed the first model - independent reddening , temperature , and metallicity constraints on a cluster emission - line nebula using faint forbidden lines .",
    "they also determined that the excitation mechanism of the emission lines could not be shocks .",
    "the preferred excitation source was stars , plus an additional , unidentified , source of heat .",
    "this conclusion was supported by analysis of the infrared emission line spectrum of paschen alpha lines and vibrationally excited h@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "one slight difference between these analyses is that the @xcite study also placed limits on the uv spectral shape , from the lack of a measurable he ii recombination line .",
    "@xcite found radial gradients in the 4000    break and mg@xmath17 indices of abell 2597 s bcg , indicating recent ( 0.1 gyr ) star formation .",

    "most recently , it has been studied in the far uv using hubble space telescope stis observations @xcite and wfpc2 blue and emission - line images @xcite .",
    "vibrationally excited molecular hydrogen was discovered to trace the same features as the optical emission lines by @xcite.the chandra x - ray observatory has reveals two - sided radio bubbles , surrounded by hot icm @xcite .",
    "this bcg also has one of the most convincing fuse detections of ovi @xcite .",
    "further , @xmath25 m@xmath16 of cold h@xmath17 has been inferred from co detections @xcite .",
    "the most recent x - ray observations of a2597 are from a 120-kilosecond xmm observation .",
    "analysis of both epic and rgs spectroscopy by @xcite suggests a classical cooling flow at the level of @xmath26 solar masses per year in the central region , dropping to about 20 m@xmath16 yr@xmath7 in the central 40 kpc surrounding the bcg .",
    "this result is based on the joint analysis of vanishingly weak ( @xmath27 ) fexvii features in the rgs and the extremely difficult interpretation of soft x - ray excess in the ccd spectrum .",
    "while this result at best is only suggestive of cooling , it makes the bcg in abell 2597 the only source with published emission - line detections from gas at @xmath28k , suggesting a possible connection between condensation from the hot gas and star formation .",
    "the infrared array camera ( irac ) has four wavelength channels , 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8 @xmath1 m @xcite .",
    "the astronomical observing request ( aor ) number for the irac observation was 13372160 .",

    "the fwhm of the psf in those bands is @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "our total observing time with the mips was 36 minutes ( total exposure time of 10 seconds per pixel at 24 @xmath1 m and 15 seconds per pixel for 70 and 160 @xmath1 m each ) .",
    "the aor number for the mips observation was 13371904 .",
    "we used the standard spitzer science center ( ssc ) pipeline processing ( software version s14.4.0 ) of the 24 , 70 , and 160 @xmath1 m data .",
    "we investigated whether the 70 and 160 @xmath1 m data would benefit from additional work .",
    "we reprocessed the raw 70 and 160 @xmath1 m data with the gert software package , following the algorithms derived by the mips instrument team and the mips instrument support team @xcite .",
    "we time - filtered the resulting 70 @xmath1 m basic data by subtracting a smoothed version of the signal obtained with a boxcar median filter of 30 frames .",
    "this procedure subtracts the residual time - variations of the response .",
    "we then used the mopex package to co - add the filtered images . in figure  [ figure:70 ]",
    "we show the gert - filtered 70 @xmath1 m image side by side with the standard pipeline image . here",
    "we note that there is some evidence for a faint extended region in the filtered data .",
    "however , since this region is aligned with the higher - noise streak in the pipeline image , subtracted from the gert data , and since a mosaic of the individual pipeline - filtered exposures does not show this feature , we do not make strong claims about its reality .",
    "we reduced the 160 @xmath1 m data in a very similar way , using gert .",
    "however , since there are very few pixels and the central source is marginally extended in an odd wedge - shape , additional filtering in the time domain did not result in significantly cleaner 160 @xmath1 m images . the exclusion of individual images taken directly after the periodic  stim \" images had no effect on the final product .",
    "the mopex package was used to combine the 160 @xmath1 m basic calibration products .",
    "we measured the flux in all seven wavebands within a circular aperture of @xmath32 ( @xmath33 kpc ) , centered on the coordinates @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( j2000 ) .",
    "( ra of @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 , dec of -12 07 29 \" ) .",
    "the background was estimated from pixels in an annulus between @xmath39 and @xmath40 from the center .",
    "we also measured the flux in a larger aperture ( @xmath41 ) for the mips 70 and 160 @xmath1 m images .",
    "a histogram of the background values was fit to a gaussian initially centered on the median background per pixel .",
    "the mean background value was subtracted from the aperture flux .",
    "the net fluxes were averaged and multiplied by the aperture sky area in steradians to yield the flux in janskys .",
    "no aperture correction was required for the irac photometry .    since the mips images are nearly point sources , we used the apex package to fit point response functions ( prfs ) and obtain total fluxes for the mips . for comparison ,",
    "we report both the large aperture flux and the prf flux for each band .",
    "we obtain reasonable agreement except in the case of the 160 @xmath1 m aperture flux , for which the aperture correction , even at @xmath41 we estimate to be @xmath42 , based on the convolution of the standard prf with the source .",
    "the irac flux uncertainties are @xmath43 .",
    "the color terms at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath1 m are unlikely to be significant ; however , if the spectrum is dominated by pahs at 5.8 and 8 @xmath1 m , the color - term corrections could be significant , up to @xmath10 .",
    "mips absolute flux uncertainties are 10% at 24 @xmath1 m and 20% at 70 and 160 @xmath1 m .",
    "we report raw and aperture - corrected aperture fluxes in table  [ table : fluxes ] .",
    "we extracted photometry for this galaxy from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) extended source catalog @xcite in j , h , and k infrared bands .",
    "absolute photometric calibration from @xcite converts the 2mass magnitudes to janskys .",
    "the 2mass total apertures ( the apertures that measured the total light from the extended source ) of @xmath44 were similar to that used for the spitzer data .",
    "we show all images ( 2mass and spitzer ) in figure  [ figure : all ] together with the @xmath32 aperture in the 1 - 24 micron images and the @xmath32 and @xmath45 aperture for the 160 micron image , for scale .",
    "the total amount of far - ir emission from the bgc in abell 2597 is @xmath46 erg s@xmath7 , corresponding to @xmath47 according to @xcite .",
    "this fir luminosity is as high as that of a lirg ( luminous infrared galaxy ) , and the broad - band spectrum is consistent with that of a starburst .",
    "the ir - inferred star formation rate is also consistent with the conclusion of @xcite that hot stars , detected in the uv , forming at the rate of a few solar masses per year , are the dominant source of ionization of the optical nebula .",
    "the emission we detect with irac is extended , but it appears to be mainly associated with the central galaxy .",
    "the mid - ir sources , except at 24 @xmath1 m , are not well - fit by point sources , but those too are completely contained within the boundaries of the stellar light of the bcg . because of spitzer s diffraction limit , we can not say much about its mid - ir morphology .",
    "it is also very difficult to place any flux limits on extremely extended emission , beyond the galaxy , such as emission from the cluster icm itself , due to the nature of mid - ir observations which require multiple , offset exposures to assess the background and the current state of knowledge about absolute spitzer backgrounds .",
    "because of the positional association of the spitzer - detected ir emission with the bcg , we suspect that what we detect is entirely interstellar , not intracluster , in nature .",
    "figure  [ figure : sed ] compares the broad - band spectral energy distribution of this galaxy with the spectrum expected from an old stellar population with zero dust .",
    "the near - infrared spectrum is fairly flat , as one would expect from an old stellar population at this redshift , and the stellar mass implied by the near - ir luminosity is @xmath48 m@xmath16 .",
    "stellar continuum emission is expected to dominate in the 3.5 and 4.5 @xmath1 m bands , and the ratio of those two bands to the near - ir emission is consistent with that expectation .",
    "those bands are well - fit by a simple giant elliptical spectral template , obtained from the sed template library of the hyper - z photometric redshift code . in the far - ir",
    ", one can see the prominent 70 - 160 @xmath1 m peak observed with mips .",
    "such a peak is expected from dust in active star - forming regions .",
    "excess emission over an old , dust - free population is also found in the 5.8 @xmath1 m and particularly in the 8 @xmath1 m irac bands .",
    "the excess at 8 @xmath1 m is likely due to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) transiently heated by uv photons from hot stars .",
    "such emission features are commonly found in the spectra of star - forming galaxies and usually accompany a far - infrared spectral peak at @xmath49 m .",
    "adding a nuclear starburst sed model from of with a total starburst luminosity of @xmath50 erg s@xmath7 to the emission from old stars yields an adequate fit ( solid line ) to the combined 2mass and spitzer photometry for this galaxy .",
    "note that pah features are not expected from dust that has been exposed to a harsh x - ray radiation environment , since tiny grains are easily disrupted by x - rays ( voit 1992 ) .",
    "this excess , if confirmed to be pah features , is an argument against the dusty gas originating from condensations from the hot icm .",
    "the 70 @xmath1m/160 @xmath1 m flux ratio is larger than that observed for higher redshift ( @xmath51 ) bcgs by egami et al .",
    "the observed ratios seen for abell 1835 and zwicky 3146 by egami et al .",
    "( 2006 ) are 0.4 - 0.6 , corresponding to a rest - frame black body temperature of @xmath52k .",
    "the observed ratio for abell 2597 is @xmath42 , corresponding to a rest - frame black body temperature of @xmath53k .",
    "this finding may mean that the temperature of the hot dust in abell 2597 is greater than in higher redshift bcgs that are forming stars more quickly than the bcg in abell 2597 .",
    "it may seem puzzling that a galaxy with a lower star formation rate ( sfr ) seems to have hotter dust than large - sfr galaxies .",
    "one possible explanation is that galaxies with very low sfrs may have only cool dust ( if any ) , those with an intermediate sfr may have warmer dust , and perhaps those with a very high sfr may destroy the dust in the star formation regions .",
    "the dust in these systems might then be farther from the heat sources , therefore generating a higher ir luminosity but at a lower dust temperature .",
    "another explanation is suggested by the radiative transfer models presented in that indicate that the very luminous ( @xmath54 ) sources are cooler because for a given @xmath55 , the dust mass @xmath56 increases like @xmath57 , and the dust temperature scales like @xmath58 .",
    "also , a large fraction of buried ob stars increases the near - ir flux .",
    "mid - ir spectra , with more than 2 - 3 points per spectrum , of these sources will provide an interesting discriminant between these model seds .",
    "assuming for the moment that the far - ir peak is indeed from star - forming regions , we can compare the implied star - formation rate with that inferred from the h@xmath3 emission .",
    "the diameter of the h@xmath3 nebula is about @xmath59 @xcite , although the high - surface brightness structure visible in the hst image from @xcite has a similar diameter to that of the radio source ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "corrected to @xmath20 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 , @xcite measure a total h@xmath3 + [ n  ii ] luminosity of @xmath61 erg s@xmath7 , which is @xmath62 erg s@xmath7 in h@xmath3 alone .",
    "( the ratio of h@xmath63[n  ii]6584   varies in this source between 0.8 - 1.0 , and the [ n  ii]6548   line flux is 1/3 that of the 6584   line . ) a reddening analysis of 5 hydrogen balmer lines in the spectrum of abell 2597 by @xcite optical depth at h@xmath64 is about 1.2 .",
    "the correction to total h@xmath3 is approximately 25% , corresponding to @xmath65 erg s@xmath7 such an analysis is insensitive to absorption by so - called `` grey '' dust , i.e. a population of large grains whose absorption is independent of wavelength .",
    "this luminosity corresponds to a total star formation rate of @xmath66 m@xmath16 yr@xmath7 using the conversion from @xcite .",
    "this rate is somewhat larger than the @xmath67 indicated by the far - ir emission but could be an overestimate if any of the h@xmath3 arises from processes other than star formation ( e.g. agn , shocks ) .",
    "the ovi detection reported by @xcite suggests a gas cooling rate @xmath68 solar masses per year in the central 26 kpc ( quantities converted to @xmath20 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 ) . this quantity is higher than the star formation rate inferred from spitzer data by a factor of @xmath69 but is consistent with the local cooling rate of @xmath70 inferred from x - ray spectra by @xcite .",
    "an alternative source of energy for both h@xmath3 and far - ir emission emission is conduction @xcite .",
    "if conduction is not completely suppressed by magnetic fields , it must transfer at least some energy from the x - ray gas to the nebula and the cooler dusty gas associated with it .",
    "if we assume saturated heat conduction @xcite from the surrounding @xmath71 kev icm through a spherical surface of radius @xmath72 kpc , we obtain a maximum heating rate of a few times @xmath73 erg s@xmath7 , which represents a significant fraction of the mid - ir luminosity of @xmath74 erg s@xmath7 .",
    "however , many factors could reduce the conductive heating rate , such as suppression of conduction via tangled magnetic fields or the deposition of energy into ionized nebular gas instead of into the grains .",
    "additional theoretical work is needed to explore more quantitatively the effect of the surrounding hot icm on the dusty clouds responsible for the far - ir emission .    in summary ,",
    "the uv observations of @xcite place a lower limit on the star - formation rate because extinction corrections revise the uv rate upwards ; the h@xmath3 luminosity provides only an approximate limit since other processes can generate h@xmath3 , and h@xmath3 can be attenuated by grey absorption .",
    "these far - ir infrared observations place the best upper limit on the obscured star formation , because alternative contributions ( such as conduction from the icm ) would also revise the inferred star formation rate downward .",
    "because we have estimated above that conduction could in principle provide up to @xmath75% of the ir luminosity , the uncertainty of the ir - inferred star formation rate is at least a factor of two , and we require better theoretical models and more detailed spectra to improve our estimates .",
    "we have detected mid - infrared emission from the central galaxy of abell 2597 with the spitzer space telescope , from 3.6 - 160 @xmath1 m .",
    "this galaxy has the luminosity and spectral shape of a lirg embedded in a giant elliptical galaxy . the far infrared luminosity rivals that of the local x - ray luminosity .",
    "we have constructed a broad - band spectrum of the galaxy , which is most simply interpreted as a dust - enshrouded stellar population forming stars at a rate @xmath47 solar masses per year inside the central @xmath45 ( @xmath76 kpc ) .",
    "this estimate is consistent within a factor of two of estimates from optical , h@xmath3 , and ultraviolet observations .",
    "we can not , however , rule out additional heating of the dust by electron thermal conduction from the hot gas , and we suggest the development of more quantitative physical models of this process .",
    "the presence of uv continuum light argues in favor of a substantial fraction of the mid - ir flux being associated with star formation .",
    "the star formation rate inferred from the mid - ir emission is somewhat lower than the cooling rate inferred from ovi and recent x - ray observations , but we can not rule out the hypothesis that cooling gas may feed the star formation implied by the uv , optical , and mid - ir data .    finally , we have have been able to model the broadband infrared sed of the bcg with a basic giant elliptical template and a standard nuclear starburst model from , including pah features .",
    "we therefore have no evidence , based on these data , that the dusty gas condensed from the hot icm .",
    "further spectroscopic detail is required to test the hypothesis that pahs are responsible for the mid - ir excess .",

    "<S> if the dust is at one temperature , the ratio of 70 to 160 micron fluxes indicate that the dust emitting mid - ir in this source is somewhat hotter than the dust emitting mid - ir in two bcgs at higher - redshift ( @xmath4 ) and higher fir luminosities observed earlier by spitzer , in clusters abell 1835 and zwicky 3146 . </S>"
