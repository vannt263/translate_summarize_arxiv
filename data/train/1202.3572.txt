    "<S> in this work , a one - dimensional model of crystalline solids based on the dirac comb limit of the krnig - penney model is considered . from the wave functions of the valence electrons , we calculate a statistical measure of complexity and the fisher - shannon information for the lower energy electronic bands appearing in the system . </S>",
    "<S> all these magnitudes present an extremal value for the case of solids having half - filled bands , a configuration where in general a high conductivity is attained in real solids , such as it happens with the monovalent metals .    </S>",
    "<S> and    crystalline solid models ; electronic band structure ; statistical indicators    the application of information theory measures to quantum systems is a subject of interest in the last years @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . some relevant properties of the hierarchical organization of atoms @xcite and nuclei @xcite are revealed when these indicators are calculated on these many - body systems . on the one hand </S>",
    "<S> , they display an increasing trend with the number of particles , electrons or nucleons . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , they take extremal values on the closure of shells . moreover , in the case of nuclei , the trace of magic numbers is displayed by these entropic products such as the fisher - shannon information @xcite and a statistical complexity measure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also these statistical quantifiers have revealed a connection with physical measures , such as the ionization potential and the static dipole polarizability @xcite in atomic physics . </S>",
    "<S> all of them , theoretical and physical magnitudes , are capable of unveiling the shell structure of atoms , specifically the closure of shells in the noble gases .    </S>",
    "<S> a strategy to calculate these indicators is to quantify the discrete hierarchical organization of these multiparticle systems through the fractional occupation probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> these probabilities capture the filling of the shell structure of these systems . from them , </S>",
    "<S> the different statistical magnitudes are derived . </S>",
    "<S> the metallic clusters is another system that has also been studied with this method @xcite . as in the case of atoms and nuclei , </S>",
    "<S> the shell structure of the valence electrons is well displayed by the spiky behavior of the statistical complexity and the magic numbers are unveiled by relevant peaks of the fisher - shannon information .    a different strategy to compute these entropic magnitudes is to use the probability density of the quantum system as the basic ingredient . </S>",
    "<S> this can be analytically obtained in some cases such as the h - atom @xcite or numerically derived in other cases from a hartree - fock scheme @xcite or a density functional - theory for atoms and molecules @xcite .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we address the problem to calculate these statistical indicators in a solid by this last strategy . for this purpose , </S>",
    "<S> the band structure of the solid has to be determined . </S>",
    "<S> the krnig - penney ( kp ) model @xcite is a one - dimensional model of crystalline solids that presents a band structure sharing many properties with band structures of more sophisticated models . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it also has the advantage that allows to analytically find such electronic band structure .    </S>",
    "<S> the kp model considers that electrons move in an infinite one - dimensional crystal where the positive ions are located at positions @xmath0 with @xmath1 , generating a periodic potential of period @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> a simplified version of the kp model is obtained when this periodic potential is taken with the form of the dirac comb @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the planck constant , @xmath5 is the electronic mass and @xmath6 is the intensity of the potential . in this case , the spatial part @xmath7 of the electronic wave function is determined from the time independent schrdinger equation : @xmath8\\psi(x ) = e\\psi(x ) , \\label{eqschro}\\ ] ] where the eigenvalue @xmath9 is the energy of the eigenstate @xmath7 .    for a periodic potential , </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eqschro ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is a plane wave , with wave number @xmath10 , modulated by a periodic function , @xmath11 : @xmath12 where @xmath11 has the periodicity of the crystal lattice : @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> it implies the following translation property , @xmath14 let us observe that we have the case of free electrons when @xmath15 and the solutions of type ( [ eq - u_k ] ) recover the plane wave form with a total wave number @xmath16 , with @xmath17 . </S>",

    "<S> two boundary conditions must be fulfilled by @xmath26 at the point @xmath27 : on the one hand , the continuity of the wave function and , on the other hand , the jump in the derivative provoked by the delta function ( [ eq - dirac ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this gives the relations : @xmath28 from these boundary conditions applied to the wave functions ( [ eq - psi1]-[eq - psi2 ] ) , the following homogeneous linear system is obtained for the unknonws @xmath23 and @xmath24 : @xmath29 to have a non - trivial solution , the determinant of this @xmath30 matrix has to be zero . </S>",
    "<S> then , the following quantization relation for @xmath19 is obtained @xcite : @xmath31 the electronic band structure of the one - dimensional crystal is contained in this equation . when @xmath10 varies its value in the different brillouin zones , given by @xmath32 , with @xmath33 for the first brillouin zone , @xmath34 for the second brillouin zone , etc . </S>",
    "<S> , only certain intervals of @xmath19 are allowed . </S>",
    "<S> these intervals for @xmath19 are the energy bands of the electronic system . </S>",
    "<S> the positive and negative parts of these intervals correspond with the positive and negative parts of the brillouin zones , respectively . in the limit @xmath35 , </S>",
    "<S> the free electron problem is recovered , then the solutions are the plane waves with @xmath16 . in the limit @xmath36 </S>",
    "<S> , we have the square well problem , then the wave number of the eigenstates verify @xmath37 . for an intermediate case , @xmath38 , eq . ( [ eq - band ] ) </S>",
    "<S> has to be solved . </S>",
    "<S> concretely , for the particular value @xmath39 , that has also been used in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the lower energy bands obtained in this system for @xmath40 are : @xmath41 the bands are symmetrically found for @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> observe that , to finally get the wave function of the electronic states , we additionally need the normalization condition to completely determine @xmath7 , except a global phase factor . for our calculations , by taking @xmath39 , we will perform this normalization in the unit cell @xmath43 $ ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the basic ingredient to calculate the statistical entropic measures in which we are interested is the probability density of the electronic states . </S>",

    "<S> let us recall the definition of the statistical complexity @xmath47 @xcite , the so - called @xmath48 complexity , that is defined as @xmath49 where @xmath50 represents the information content of the system and @xmath51 gives an idea of how much sharp is its spatial distribution . as a quantifier of @xmath50 </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , that is , @xmath55    , vs. the adimensional wave number , @xmath56 , for @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> only the four lower electronic bands given in expression ( [ eq - bandas ] ) are shown.,width=453 ]    the entropy , @xmath53 , and the statistical complexity , @xmath47 , for the lower electronic bands of the present one - dimensional crystalline solid are given in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] and fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> when this hypothetical solid is in a situation of high conductivity , i.e. when it contains a band that is partially filled and partially empty , it can be observed in the figures that the more energetic electrons attain the highest entropy and the lowest complexity in the vicinity of the half - filled band . </S>",
    "<S> this is the point where in general the highest conductivity is also attained . </S>",
    "<S> take , for instance , the real case of the monovalent metals , that include the alkali metals ( li , na , k , rb , cs ) and the noble metals ( cu , ag , au ) . </S>",
    "<S> these metals present all the bands completely filled or empty , except an only half - filled conduction band @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> compared with other solids , these metals display a very high conductivity , that in the cases of ag and cu it is the highest in nature . </S>",
    "<S> then , it is remarkable this coincidence at the point of half - filled band where , on the one hand , the entropy and the statistical complexity are extrema for this model of solids and , on the other hand , the conductivity reaches its upper values for the real cases of monovalent metals .    , vs. the adimensional wave number , @xmath56 , for @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> only the four lower electronic bands given in expression ( [ eq - bandas ] ) are shown.,width=453 ]    now , we check that other statistical entropic measures also display this behavior when the solid has half - filled bands . </S>",
    "<S> let us take , for instance , the fisher - shannon information , @xmath57 , that has been applied in different contexts @xcite for atomic systems . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity is given by @xmath58 where the first factor @xmath59 is a version of the exponential shannon entropy @xcite , and the second factor @xmath60 ^ 2\\over \\rho(x)}\\ ; dx\\;,\\ ] ] is the so - called fisher information measure @xcite , that quantifies the stiffness of the probability density . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] for @xmath53 and @xmath47 , in the sense that the extremal values of @xmath57 for this model of solids are also reached at the half - filling band points .    </S>",
    "<S> , vs. the adimensional wave number , @xmath56 , for @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> only the four lower electronic bands given in expression ( [ eq - bandas ] ) are shown.,width=453 ]    the former calculations are done orbital by orbital , i.e. thinking that the solid is a set of individual and independent orbitals , each one identified by its own wave number @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> we can change the point of view of the problem and to think that the solid stands in some kind of collective state whose probability density @xmath61 is the normalized sum of all the allowed electronic densities obtained from the orbitals with wave numbers in the interval @xmath62 $ ] ; @xmath63 will be the minimal electronic wave number of the solid , i.e. the lowest @xmath19 obtained in the first band , and @xmath64 will be the upper @xmath19 corresponding to the most energetic electron of the solid . </S>",
    "<S> the expression for @xmath61 is @xmath65 observe that @xmath61 is normalized in the interval @xmath43 $ ] , @xmath66 , and that in the present model of solid @xmath67 as given in formulas ( [ eq - bandas ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of the statistical complexity @xmath68 for this @xmath61 is presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] . in this case , the minimal values of @xmath68 are also located in the vicinity of the half - filled electronic bands such as the behavior of @xmath47 for the individual orbitals shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . in the hypothetical limit case of a solid where @xmath69 , </S>",
    "<S> let us remark that the density @xmath61 will tend to the uniform density and then the lowest value of complexity , @xmath70 , can be reached , as it can be seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] .    , vs. the adimensional wave number , @xmath56 , for @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> only the four lower electronic bands given in expression ( [ eq - bandas ] ) are shown.,width=453 ]    in summary , this work puts in evidence that certain conformational properties of many - body systems are reflected by the behavior of the statistical complexity @xmath47 and the fisher - shannon information @xmath57 . in the present study , the electronic band structure of a model of solids has been unfolded and the measurement of these magnitudes for such a model has been achieved . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable the fact that the extremal values of @xmath47 and @xmath57 are attained on the configurations with half - filled bands , which is also the electronic band configuration displayed by the solids with the highest conductivity , let us say the monovalent metals . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the calculation of these statistical indicators for a model of solids has unveiled certain physical properties of these systems , in the same way that these entropic measures also reveal some conformational aspects of other quantum many - body systems . </S>"
