    "thermonuclear , or type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) , are the result of the explosion of carbon - oxygen white dwarfs . despite their well known observed properties , the nature of the progenitor systems that produce a sne  ia event has not been hitherto elucidated , and several scenarios have been proposed , none of which gives a satisfactory answer to all the abundant observational material .",
    "the scenarios can be classified into six categories  see , for instance , @xcite for a recent discussion of some of the channels , and @xcite and @xcite for extended reviews of some of these scenarios .",
    "as there is no consensus on which are the sn  ia progenitor(s ) , it is crucial to refer to all scenarios ( or categories of scenarios ) when confronting them with observations .",
    "we list them in alphabetical order , and cite only a few references for each scenario : a ) the core - degenerate ( cd ) scenario @xcite , b ) the double - degenerate ( dd ) scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ) , c ) the double - detonation ( ddet ) mechanism ( e.g. , @xcite .",
    "d ) the single - degenerate ( sd ) scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ) , e ) the recently proposed singly - evolved star ( ses ) scenario @xcite , and f ) the wd - wd collision ( wwc ) scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since all these scenarios involve white dwarfs , all progenitors evolve through one or two planetary nebula ( pn ) phases . accordingly , one of the pieces of evidence that would help in constraining sn  ia scenarios is to study pne .",
    "furthermore , in some cases sn  ia have been even claimed to take place inside planetary nebulae ( e.g. , @xcite ) , a process termed snip .    in a recent paper @xcite analyzed the central binary system of the planetary nebula henize  2428 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the light curve of this pn shows two nearly identical broad minima , indicating significant tidal distortion of the components of binary system , and that there is an absorption line of he  ii  5412     that varies with time .",
    "given that the two minima of the light curve are practically identical , they assumed that they are caused by a binary system composed of two equal - mass stars of the same type , and found the temperature , radius , and luminosity , of the two stars to be almost identical .",
    "they further argued that most likely these are two degenerate stars , i.e. , white dwarfs or cores of post - asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , on their way to become co white dwarfs .",
    "as the combined mass in this model is @xmath0 , @xcite further argued that these two stars will merge to form a sn  ia in the frame of the dd scenario .",
    "here we critically discuss the explanation of @xcite . as we explain in sect .",
    "[ sec : considerations ] we find the interpretation of the observations of @xcite to be plausible , albeit other possibilities are conceivable . in sect .",
    "[ sec : model ] we relax the assumptions of these authors and we propose alternative models of the binary system .",
    "the first of these models consists of binary system in which only one of the components is a degenerate star , while the secondary star is normal non - evolved star .",
    "the second of the models involves two non - identical degenerate stars , but with a combined mass smaller than the chandrasekhar limiting mass .",
    "a short summary is given in sect .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "@xcite argue for a binary system composed of two stars having the same mass , @xmath1 , the same luminosity , @xmath2 at a distance of @xmath3 , and the same radius , @xmath4 .",
    "this implies that the two stars are at the same evolutionary stage .",
    "however , any small difference in the main sequence mass will turn to a large one on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "an agb star having a core of @xmath5 burns hydrogen at a rate of @xmath6 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for a difference in mass between the two cores",
    "@xmath7 the difference of evolutionary times between the post - agb stars should be @xmath8 .",
    "this requires a mass difference on the main sequence of @xmath9 , depending on the initial mass of the stars .",
    "it could be argued that there are other binary systems with almost identical components , known as twin binaries @xcite .",
    "specifically , @xcite studied 21 detached eclipsing binaries in the small magellanic cloud and found that 50% of detached binaries have companions with very similar masses .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite concluded that there is a strong observational bias that affects spectroscopically selected binary stars , and that the apparent overabundance of twin binaries does not reflect their true population . in summary ,",
    "the case for a twin binary is possible , but unlikely , hence motivates us for a careful reexamination of such a claim .",
    "as mentioned , in the model proposed by @xcite each star is a post - agb star with a mass of @xmath10 .",
    "when a post - agb of that mass fades to a luminosity of @xmath11 its radius is already @xmath12 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this radius is about 30 times smaller than the radius suggested by @xcite .",
    "this poses a serious problem to their model .    in the first of our models we investigate a case where the luminosity of the system is due to just one star , and the luminosity of the companion is negligible",
    " see below for more details . at a distance of @xmath13 as deduced by @xcite the luminosity is @xmath14 .",
    "this can be a star whose evolution was truncated on the upper red giant branch ( rgb ) , when its core mass was only @xmath15 , or on the lower agb when its core mass was @xmath16 . on the other hand , if the distance is larger , say @xmath17 , the luminosity is @xmath18 .",
    "this can be a star whose evolution was truncated on the lower agb , when its core mass was only @xmath19 . in our proposed model the companion that terminated the rgb or the agb evolution of the primary component is a main sequence star of @xmath20 . in the second of our models",
    "we assume that indeed both stars are post - agb stars but we allow the stars to have different physical parameters , namely different masses , effective temperatures and luminosities .",
    "a note is in place here on the distance to henize  2 - 428 .",
    "@xcite provided a rough estimate of the distance of @xmath21 based on the dereddened apparent magnitudes of henize  2428 .",
    "@xcite obtained a distance of @xmath22 , @xcite derived a distance of @xmath23 , while the most recent determination of @xcite , using the h@xmath24 surface brightness ",
    "radius relation is also @xmath23 .",
    "based on these values we will scale our expressions with two distances , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , as the value adopted by @xcite was obtained from their fit to the properties of the binary system , which is questioned here .",
    "the arguments of @xcite for their claim of a binary system of equal - mass stars at the same evolutionary stage are the nearly identical minima in the light curve , and the line profile of the he  ii  5412     spectral feature  see their figures 2 and 3 .",
    "the nearly identical minima of the light curve have been suggested to be indicative that both members of the binary system have very similar masses .",
    "additionally , @xcite found that the he  ii  5412    spectral line of henize  2428 is variable .",
    "they attributed the variability of this line to doppler shifts of two equal - mass stars , and then used two gaussian absorption profiles to model the variation .",
    "consequently , in their joint analysis of the light curve and the spectrum they _ forced _ the mass ratio @xmath27 of the binary system to be 1 .",
    "furthermore , @xcite _ did not model the spectra _ of both components of the binary system , since they were not able to measure surface gravities for each one of the individual binary members .",
    "finally , they _ assumed _ that both stars are at the same evolutionary stage .",
    "all of these assumptions are critical in their analysis .",
    "in particular , it must be stressed that even if the mass ratio is close to 1 , the nature of the stars can be very different , and that the lack of determinations of surface gravities leaves room for alternative explanations . in particular ,",
    "a close look at figures 2 and 3 of @xcite suggests that the spectrum of henize  2428 can be explained by assuming that there is an emission line on top of the absorption profile .",
    "we therefore examine a possible alternative interpretation where the line profile is the result of a wide absorption line belonging to the primary star , and a narrow emission line coming from the compact dense nebula reported by @xcite , or which originates even much closer to the star from the wind itself . in this alternative explanation",
    "both emission and absorption lines change with orbital phase .",
    "this is not unusual .",
    "many central stars of planetary nebulae show he  ii absorption lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the emission line is seen in some nebulae , e.g. , in abell  48 whose central star is a wn star @xcite .",
    "most interestingly , in the study of @xcite there are several pne that show a wide he  ii  5412     absorption line with a weak emission feature in the center of the wide absorption line .",
    "this forms a spectral structure similar to that of henize  2428 .",
    "the most noticeable examples of this are the pne he  2105 , he  2434 , and to some degree sp  3 and pc  12 .",
    "all these central stars are o stars . to these",
    "we add the pn pa  5 , for which the central star shows a wide he  ii  5412     absorption line and the resolved nebula shows a narrow he  ii  5412     emission line @xcite .",
    "another relevant case is the central star of the eskimo planetary nebula ( ngc 2392 ) .",
    "the he  ii  5412  line shows a structure similar to that of henize  2428 @xcite .",
    "this structure varies on time scales down to about an hour .",
    "@xcite attribute the variation in the line to a variable distribution of clumps in the wind , variations in the velocity field , and/or the mass loss rate , rather to a binary star .",
    "it could be argued that if our interpretation is correct , and the he  ii  5412     emission line is nebular , a he  ii  4686    emission line should be also observed , but it is not .",
    "however , other pne , like he  2105 , pc  12 , he  2434 and sp  3 have spectra with weak he  ii  5412    bumps ( which we interpret as an emission line ) in the center of a broad absorption line , whereas the he  ii  4686    line is in absorption @xcite . on the other hand , in the pn m  114 the he  ii  5412",
    "  line is in absorption but the he  ii  4686    occurs in emission @xcite .",
    "these cases show that there is an interplay between emission and absorption in the he  ii lines .",
    "this suggests that the emission region , like the absorption one , is located very close to the star , but not at the same place . in all these cases",
    "both the absorption and emission features vary with orbital phase . in conclusion , based on the current observations the existence of a he  ii emission line on top of the broad absorption feature",
    "can not be discarded , and needs to be considered .",
    "furthermore , @xcite established an upper limit on the effective temperature of the members of the binary system of @xmath28 , based on the absence of a he  ii  5412     emission line , but there are many pne whose central stars have effective temperatures larger than @xmath29 and do not have he  ii emission lines .",
    "since we assume that the emission line is indeed present in the spectrum , the upper limit of @xcite to the effective temperature is no longer valid , and the effective temperature could be sufficiently large to allow emission .",
    "consequently , in the following we will scale quantities with an effective temperature @xmath30 .",
    "according to all the considerations put forward in the previous section , here we explore two models in which the mass ratio is @xmath31 , but with different characteristics .",
    "the first of these models involves a semi - detached system in which the members of the binary system are not at the same evolutionary stage , while for the second model we adopt an overcontact binary system made of two post - agb stars , as @xcite did , but with less restrictive assumptions .",
    "we first examine a binary model where the secondary is a main sequence star of mass @xmath32 .",
    "if we take the primary to be a post - rgb star of mass @xmath33 or a post - agb of mass @xmath34 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , then these two cases span a mass ratio of @xmath35 . using the expression for the roche lobe radius @xmath36 from @xcite",
    ", we find for the primary star @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively , where @xmath41 is the orbital separation . for the secondary star we find @xmath42 and @xmath38 for @xmath39 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "for an orbital period of @xmath44  h the orbital separation ( for a circular orbit ) is @xmath45 , and the roche lobe of the primary star is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the total binary mass . from the primary luminosity , @xmath48 , and for the effective temperature assumed here , the primary radius is @xmath49 for a distance of @xmath50 the primary radius with that effective temperature is @xmath51 , but taking a temperature @xmath52 will make the primary just filling in its roche lobe . in our model",
    "the primary is close to filling its roche lobe ( assuming synchronization ) . for the secondary",
    "the roche lobe radius is in the range @xmath53 .",
    "thus , the secondary also touches its roche lobe .",
    "we consider two possible evolutionary scenarios .",
    "we prefer the post - rgb one , but can not rule out the post - agb one .",
    "we first describe the relevant evolutionary tracks on the hertzsprung - russell diagram , and then turn to discuss the two possible scenarios .",
    "the last step of our analysis consists of computing the light curve of the proposed binary system .",
    "kpc ( filled square ) and when @xmath54  kpc ( asterisk).,title=\"fig : \" ] +  kpc ( filled square ) and when @xmath54  kpc ( asterisk).,title=\"fig : \" ]    in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] we present some relevant evolutionary tracks on the hertzsprung - russell diagram , together with the approximate location of the central star of henize  2428 at two distances , @xmath13 ( square ) and @xmath55 ( asterisk ) , and the position reported by @xcite , circle .",
    "the sequences of masses @xmath56 and @xmath57 were taken from @xcite , and are the result of the full evolution of zero - age main sequence ( zams ) stars with masses @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively , of solar metallicity .",
    "the evolution is followed through all the relevant stages , including the hydrogen and helium core burning phases , the thermally - pulsing agb phase , and the post - agb evolution to the white dwarf stage .",
    "the @xmath60 sequence was also taken from @xcite , and corresponds to a progenitor of mass @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "in addition , the post - rgb evolution of a @xmath63 helium - core low - mass white dwarf is included .",
    "this sequence is the result of the non - conservative binary evolution of a star of mass @xmath64 that abandons the rgb before the onset of core helium burning @xcite .",
    "finally , the evolutionary track of a @xmath65 post - agb remnant of a @xmath66 progenitor with metallicity @xmath62 that experiences a late thermal pulse ( ltp ) when its effective temperature was @xmath67  k is shown as well . as a result of the ltp , the post - agb remnant experiences a fast evolution to the blue .",
    "after reaching a maximum effective temperature , this remnant evolves back to the domain of giant stars .",
    "note that the luminosity inferred for henize  2428 , for the effective temperatures used by @xcite and by us , is substantially smaller than that predicted by post - agb evolutionary models for masses of @xmath68 .",
    "the claimed masses for the two central stars of henize  2428 do not fit the other claimed properties of the stars in the model proposed by @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath69 post - agb star presented here ( upper panel ) experiences an ltp at @xmath70 , which brings the remnant back rapidly to the red giant domain and finally to the white dwarf stage .",
    "such an evolutionary track covers the general region of henize  2428 on the hertzsprung - russell diagram .    finally , the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] displays the evolution of a star with @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",

    "was removed to mimic a common - envelope episode .",
    "the final mass of the remnant after this intense episode of mass loss is @xmath74 .",
    "the evolution in the hertzsprung - russell diagram of this sequence shows several blue loops , which are due to successive ignitions of the hydrogen shell . as can be seen , this track is also able to reproduce the observed position of henize  2428 , for our adopted distance .    in conclusion , post - rgb helium - core remnants with stellar masses of @xmath75 and low - mass cores of agb stars that truncate the lower agb with masses of @xmath76 can account for the central star of henize  2428 .",
    "@xcite studied 15 bipolar pne , and only in henize  2428 they detect no h@xmath77 emission , and it was the only pn in their sample in which a bright central star was found .",
    "it seems there is something strange in the evolution of this pn , which here is attributed to the system being a post - rgb star .",
    "@xcite found the low abundances of most elements they study ( relative to hydrogen ) of henize  2428 to be similar to those found for pne belonging to the galactic halo .",
    "they suggested that this points to a low - mass progenitor .",
    "it is quite possible that the central star of henize  2428 is a post - rgb star orbited by a low - mass main sequence star .",
    "the post - rgb scenario is compatible with the low nebular mass , as the initial stellar mass in this scenario is @xmath78 , and the post - rgb mass is @xmath79 .      in this proposed alternative scenario",
    "the evolution of the primary star is truncated on the lower agb when its luminosity is between @xmath80 and @xmath81 and its radius is @xmath82 , assuming in this case a distance of @xmath83 .",
    "the core mass is @xmath84 ( e.g. , @xcite ; fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] here )",
    ". the companion will spiral - in due to tidal forces when the primary radius is about quarter of the orbital separation @xcite .",
    "the initial orbital separation in this scenario is therefore @xmath85 .    to avoid engulfment already on the rgb phase of the primary star ,",
    "the primary size on the rgb must be @xmath86 , which limits the initial mass of the primary star to be @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this scenario the agb star is more massive , and a more massive nebula is expected .",
    "now the natural question is whether this model is consistent with the observations of @xcite . clearly , in our model",
    "both components of the binary system have similar masses , and the stars are very close .",
    "thus , the minima of the light curve will be broad , as a consequence of tidal distortion of the components of the binary system .",
    "this is in accordance with the observed light curve obtained by @xcite .",
    "however , there is a fundamental difference between our model and that of @xcite . due to the large luminosity contrast between the evolved object and the main sequence star , in our model the secondary star can be easily unnoticed in a first analysis , and the minima of the light curve are due to ellipsoidal variations of the post - agb star .",

    "[ tab : semidetached ] [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     given that to fit the observational data the secondary component in the case of semidetached system should have a luminosity nearly equal to that of the primary we propose an alternative model in which both stars are at the same evolutionary stage .",
    "however , we relax the assumptions of @xcite to allow for a more physically motivated solution .",
    "in particular , we assume that the position of henize  2428 in the hertzsprung - russell diagram corresponds to that of a model post - agb star of mass @xmath92 , red line in fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] .",
    "thus , we adopt again @xmath93  k. we note that since this mass is very similar to that found when a semi - detached system is considered we keep the orbital separation at @xmath94",
    ". additionally we did not take into account the mass ratio and the semi - major axis they derive because they are mainly constrained by the radial velocity fits , which we have argued that may not be related to the binary nature of the system .",
    "nevertheless , the distance to the object and its luminosity may provide constraints on the scale of the binary system .",
    "following our previous estimates in the case of a semi - detached binary , the total luminosity of the system is scaled by @xmath95 . if we consider the independent distance measurements listed earlier in sect .",
    "[ subsec : stellar ] , henize  2428 may be at distance between 1.7  kpc and @xmath96  kpc @xcite .",
    "then , the total luminosity of the system would be between 1,246 and 4,415  @xmath97 .",
    "we did not consider the distance estimate of @xcite , which is shorter , to keep our estimates independent of the light curve data we are using .",
    "complementary , the total luminosity can also be computed from the effective temperatures , and relative radii derived from the light curve fits , along with the assumed semi - major axis . therefore , the distance limits may provide constraints on the orbital semi - major axis .    taking all this into account we have performed fits to the light curves assuming different values of mass ratio ( from 0.5 to 1.5 ) and semi - major axis ( from 1.0 to @xmath98 ) , fixing @xmath93  k. the resulting light curves for our best fit model are shown in fig .",

    "we note that , as expected , neither the semi - major axis nor the mass ratio have a significant impact on the quality of the fits at the level of precision of the light curves . however , they have an obvious impact on the absolute properties of the system . on the one hand ,",
    "the absolute radius of each component is proportional to @xmath41 , which defines the scale of the system . on the other hand , the relative size of each component ( @xmath99 , derived from the pseudo - potential )",
    "is correlated with the mass ratio because the stars of the binary are in contact . from the relative radii , the effective temperature and the semi - major axis , we computed the total luminosity of the system for each fit ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "the results show that the previously computed luminosity limits are consistent with a semi - major axis ranging from 1.0 to @xmath101 , almost independently of the value of the mass ratio . given the period of the system ,",
    "this can be translated into a total mass of the system in the range @xmath102 .",

    "the best fit is found for @xmath106 , very close to the ratio adopted by @xcite , although it is poorly constrained by the light curves . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : overcontact ] , for this model the agreement between the theoretical light curves and the observed ones is excellent , both in the b - band and in the i - band , being the residuals very small , 16.93  mmag and 3.25  mmag , respectively . for the best fit model ,",
    "the inclination of the system is @xmath107 and the effective temperature of the secondary star is @xmath108  k. these parameters yield the masses of both components of the binary system , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 .",

    "nevertheless , we stress here that the absolute properties of the components of henize  2428 are only roughly constrained by the light curve fits if we take into account the range of mass ratios and orbital semi - major axes that produce comparable fits to the light curves .",
    "table  [ tab : overcontact ] shows the properties of the best fit described above , with the range of possible values associated to the mass ratio and semimajor axis uncertainties . although the combined analysis of light curves and the position in the hertzsprung  russell diagram favor a scenario of two similar stars with masses @xmath112 , only precise radial velocities can better constrain the model",
    "we addressed the recent claim made by @xcite that the central binary system of the planetary nebula henize  2428 is a sn  ia progenitor in the frame of the double - degenerate scenario .",
    "this claim has attracted some attention , and if true it would be the first super - chandrasekhar mass binary white dwarf system with short period discovered ever .",
    "more interestingly , it would be definitely located in the center of a planetary nebula , providing strong evidence for sn  ia occurring inside pne , termed snips @xcite . however , we found that , although certainly possible , this claim is not yet univocally supported by the observations , and that different explanations are possible , and need to be considered .",
    "our statement is based not only on purely theoretical considerations about the evolutionary properties of the central object of henize  2428 , but also on the way the observed data set has been analyzed .",
    "in particular , in sect .  [",
    "sec : considerations ] we argued that the claim for an equal - masses binary system and the required mass , luminosity , and radius of the two stars does not comply with evolutionary tracks of post - agb stars ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hr ] ) .",
    "we also analyzed critically the way in which observations were interpreted , and we questioned the two most important assumptions made to study the observed properties of the binary system at the center of henize  2428 .",
    "these are that both components of the binary system have exactly the same mass , and that , moreover , they are at the same evolutionary stage .    in particular , in sect .",
    "[ subsec : stellar ] we argued that there are strong theoretical arguments that pose a problem to the scenario proposed by @xcite .",
    "one of these arguments is that that the initial mass difference in the main sequence must be very small .",
    "the second one is that the population of twin binaries is small .",
    "furthermore , in sect .",
    "[ subsec : observations ] we critically examined the joint analysis of the light curves and the spectrum of @xcite . specifically , we argued that the explanation of @xcite of the variability of the he  ii  5412    absorption spectral line as arising from doppler shifts of two absorption lines , one from each star , is not the only possible one .",
    "instead , we suggested that the variability of the he  ii  5412    spectral line can be accounted for by a , possibly time - varying , broad absorption line from the central star on top of which there is a time - varying narrow emission line from the compact nebula or even from much closer to the star .",
    "@xcite find the age of the henize  2 - 428 equatorial ring to be @xmath113 .",
    "although the ring is old , there is a compact dense nebula near the central star @xcite .",
    "it is quite possible that the he  ii  5412    narrow emission spectral line sitting on top of the broad absorption line originates in the compact nebula , or from an outflow that feeds the compact nebula much closer to the star .",
    "this explanation could also be compatible with the observed spectrum , but more detailed studies and better observations are needed to resolve in detail the spectral feature .",
    "all these considerations led us to judge that although the first of the assumptions of @xcite  namely , that both stars have approximately the same mass  is quite possible , the second one  that both components of the binary system are at exactly the same evolutionary stage  is not fully justified , and needs an independent evaluation . since these two assumptions are quite restrictive , we explored alternative models .",
    "accordingly , we analyzed other possible explanations , less extraordinary but that could fit equally well the observations and , simultaneously , do not contradict stellar evolutionary results ( sect .",
    "[ sec : model ] ) .",
    "the first of these scenarios still hold the existence of a binary system , as the two ( almost ) symmetric broad minima in the light curve are attributed to tidal distortion caused by a companion of similar mass . in particular , we mentioned a binary system composed of either a post - rgb or a post - agb star with a low - mass companion . in the first case , a low - mass main sequence star truncates the evolution of a star of initial mass @xmath114 on the upper rgb . in the second scenario ,",
