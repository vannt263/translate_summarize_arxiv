    "when the amateur astronomer jay mcneil discovered a new nebula in the l1630 molecular cloud in orion in january 2004 ( mcneil 2004 ) , little did he know that it would spark significant and extensive worldwide follow - up investigations .",
    "the nebula he discovered has subsequently been designated `` mcneil s nebula '' and its illuminating / exciting star named v1647  orionis ( samus 2004 ) . to date , around 30 publications have resulted from these studies spanning the electromagnetic spectrum from x - ray to radio wavelengths . in these research papers , considerable speculation has been put forth as to the nature of this eruptive event , yet it is generally agreed that it is the result of a rapid and massive increase in accretion onto the surface of the young star .",

    "such eruptive events have been observed in a number of young stars dating back to the observations and discussions by herbig ( 1966 ) . in this and subsequent papers , herbig ( 1966 , 1977 , 1989 ) suggested that these eruptions can be classed as either short - term exors events ( after the progenitor ex  lupi ) lasting between a few weeks to a few years , or long - term fuors events ( after the progenitor fu  ori ) lasting decades to possibly even a century .",
    "much emphasis has been placed on determining what type of outburst has occurred in the case of v1647  ori , yet more compelling perhaps is understanding whether the fuor and exor classes are fundamentally similar in their origins or whether they are the result of distinct phenomena occurring on different timescales .    if the outburst of v1647  ori is a fuor type eruption , then it is the first in almost 40 years since that of v1057  cyg ( welin 1971 ) . a large - scale effort to monitor v1647",
    "ori was therefore undertaken involving use of both gemini observatory 8meter telescopes ( north and south ) and the nasa irtf 3meter telescope over three observing semesters and utilizing six different facility instruments .",
    "this campaign resulted in approximately monthly optical imaging and spectroscopic and near - ir spectroscopic observations of v1647  ori . in this paper , the first in a series describing these data , we present optical observations spanning the outburst phase , from the first follow - up observations taken soon after its discovery ( taken in 2004 february and published in reipurth & aspin 2004 ) to the time when the source had faded to its pre - outburst brightness ( in february 2006 ) .",
    "clearly , the approximately two year lifetime of this event suggests that , at least superficially , the eruption of v1647  ori is more similar to exor event than those occurring in fuors .    in this paper",
    "we present optical imaging and spectroscopic observations of v1647  ori taken between february 2004 and february 2006 and discuss the variations present in these data .",
    "the observations and data reduction are described in @xmath12 . in @xmath13",
    "we present details of the temporal changes observed , and in @xmath14 we consider what these observations imply regarding two physical components of the outburst , i.e. the fast wind and the accretion process .",
    "finally , in @xmath15 we piece together a time - line for the event and detail the evolution of the eruption as implied by the data from our monitoring campaign .",
    "all but one dataset presented below were acquired using the `` frederick c. gillett '' gemini north telescope located on mauna kea , hawaii using the facility optical imager and spectrograph , gmos - n ( davies et al .",
    "1997 ; hook et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the imaging observations used standard gmos - n g , r , i , and z filters which were designed to be as close as possible in characteristics to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) filters ( fukugita et al . 1996 ) . for the spectroscopic observations , all but one used the blue 600 lines / mm grating and 0@xmath25 wide long - slit .",
    "the one exception , the first observation taken , used the red 831 lines / mm grating , again with a 0@xmath25 wide long - slit .",

    "the complete observation log is presented in table  [ obslog ] . in total , we acquired photometry at 16 different epochs and spectroscopy at 15 different epochs over the eruption period .",
    "the additional spectrum of v1647  ori was acquired using the w.m .",
    "keck  ii telescope located on mauna kea , hawaii , using the facility high - resolution echelle spectrograph hires ( vogt et al .",
    "the observations were made on ut 2004",
    "september 24 when the star had an optical v magnitude of about 17 .",
    "the spectra covered the wavelength range 5800 to 7150    and 7320 to 8700    at a nominal spectral resolution of r@xmath346,000 using a 0@xmath286 wide slit .",
    "the on - source exposure time used was 60 minutes .",
    "all datasets were reduced using the gemini iraf data reduction package v1.8 .",
    "specifically , we used the routines gireduce for basic instrument signature removal ( trim the images , subtract the master bias image , and divide by the normalized master twilight flat field ) , and gmosaic for combining the data from the three gmos - n ccds into one image .",
    "in addition , multiple exposures of the region were coadded using the iraf routine imcombine .",
    "aperture photometry of v1647  ori was performed using the starlink program gaia ( draper et al .",
    "an aperture diameter of 2@xmath5 was used for the photometric calculation and , due to the bright nebulosity immediately surrounding the star , the sky signal was estimated from numerous apertures located in blank sky regions throughout the image .",
    "the full width half maximum ( fhwm ) seeing values in the acquired images are also given in table  [ obslog ] .",
    "since some of the data were acquired during non - photometric conditions , a photometric calibration was achieved relative to a dataset taken on a photometric night , ut 2004 february 14 .",
    "a series of six field stars were used to provide a calibration sequence ; their position and magnitudes are listed in table  [ calstars ] .",
    "since the region containing v1647  ori is one with active star formation and young stars are well - known to be variable , using six field stars as calibrators was considered an acceptable way of minimizing errors introduced by intrinsic variability of the calibrator stars themselves .",
    "these stars , together with v1647  ori , are identified in fig .",
    "[ idplot ] . using instrumental magnitudes derived from calibrators",
    ", we additionally studied the variability of individual calibrators themselves and concluded that uncertainties resulting from source variability were small and within the quoted uncertainties on the v1647  ori photometry .",
    "in addition to this , and to provide a consistency check , we have used the sdss photometry of v1647  ori from ut nov 11 , 1998 .",
    "these data were part of the early `` orion '' release ( finkbeiner et al .",
    "2004 ) downloaded from princeton university , and quoted in mcgehee et al .",
    "photometry of the same calibration sequence stars was extracted from the sdss data and found to be consistent with the photometry from our gmos images within the associated errors ( shown in table  [ calstars ] ) .",
    "again , all the gemini / gmos data were reduced using the gemini iraf data reduction package v1.8 .",
    "specifically , we used the routines gsreduce , gstransform , gsskysub , gscrrej , and gsextract for basic instrument signature removal ( trim the images , subtract the master bias image , and divide by the normalized flat field ) , wavelength calibration , sky line subtraction , cosmic ray removal , and point - source spectrum extraction , respectively .",
    "the resultant spectra were not flux calibrated nor were atmospheric features removed since we were primarily interested in the spectral features present and their intrinsic variability .",
    "in addition , h@xmath0 has been shown to be a relatively insensitive diagnostic for accretion rate due to it , and other balmer lines , becoming optically thick at high accretion rates ( muzerolle et al .",
    "1998 ) , thus negating any requirement for flux determinations .",
    "8 of muzerolle et al .",
    "( 1998 ) show model predictions for h@xmath0 flux vs. accretion rate and it is clear that the relationship saturates at around 10@xmath6  m@xmath7  yr@xmath4 .",
    "such rather low accretion rates are typically found in weak - line t tauri stars ( wtts ) and low activity classical t  tauri stars ( ctts ) like dn and dq  tau and not eruptive variables such as v1647  ori .    for our hires data ,",
    "a standard reduction was performed , including bias correction , flat - fielding , scattered - light correction , order extraction , and wavelength calibrations using standard routines in the iraf echelle package .",
    "in fig .  [ photplot ] we show our optical photometry of v1647  ori from 2004 february to 2006 february for all four passbands , namely g , r , i , and z. the horizontal dashed and dotted lines represent the pre - outburst sdss brightness of the star ( labeled filter@xmath8 ) .",
    "the solid lines simply join the discrete observation points as a guide to the eye .",
    "the two long ` gaps ' in the observation sampling are the 2004 and 2005 summer months when orion was not visible during the nighttime period .    over the summer of 2004 , the source appeared to remain at approximately the same brightness",
    ", however , it is likely that some small - scale variability occurred .",
    "our data from the 20042005 winter months suggests that variability at the @xmath30.5 magnitude level was present .",
    "such fluctuations were also reported by mcgehee et al .",

    "( 2007 ) during several different observing periods .    over the summer of 2005",
    ", v1647  ori exhibited a small yet significant decline in brightness , approximately the same in all filters , and amounting to @xmath91 magnitude . immediately after this period , in 2005",
    "september , a major decline phase began . from 2005",
    "september onwards , the trend was for monotonic dimming , with possibly some slowing occurring in late 2005 . by the time of our last g band photometric observation ( in early 2006 january ) , v1647  ori had already faded by about 4.4 magnitudes from its maximum brightness . at r , we obtained one further observation ( in 2006 mid - february ) which shows a total fading of over 5 magnitudes . at this time",
    "v1647  ori was already close to its pre - outburst sdss r magnitude of 23.04 .",
    "in late 2006 december we took a short r - band exposure of v1647  ori at the university of hawaii 2.2 m telescope on mauna kea , hawaii which showed that the source had remained very faint and close to the above pre - outburst sdss brightness .",
    "in addition , abr08 presented photometry from 2007 february which showed v1647  ori still close to its pre - outburst brightness ( r=23.26@xmath100.15 ) .",
    "below , we make use of sdss photometry and therefore we briefly consider the significance of any differences in photometric systems involved to give confidence to the analysis that follows . as we noted above , the gmos g,r,i,z filters were designed to be close to identical to those used by the sdss survey ( smith et al .",
    "we therefore expect the photometric results from gmos to be quite similar to those from sdss .",
    "however , to quantify this we have studied the gmos and sdss photometry of the calibration sequence used to boot - strap the photometry of v1647  ori over the monitoring period . in fig .",
    "[ sestar ] we show the photometry of one representative field star labeled s4 in fig .  [ idplot ] .",
    "these photometric values were derived using standard gmos zeropoints for the observing period ( i.e. zp(g)=27.93 , zp(r)=28.18 , zp(i)=27.90 , zp(z)=26.77 , jorgensen 2009 ) determined using observations of landolt ( 1992 ) standard stars observed close in time to the ut 2004 february 14 , v1647  ori observations .",
    "the magnitudes of the landolt standards ( in the johnson - kron - cousins photometric system ) were transformed to the sdss photometric system using the relationships derived by smith et al .",
    "the horizontal lines through the observations are the mean magnitudes of s4 in each gmos filter ( dot - dashed lines ) and the sdss magnitude of s4 from november 1998 sdss observations ( dashed lines ) .",
    "we note that the slight shift between these lines suggest small differences in stellar magnitudes , however , the shifts are in all cases smaller than the associated 1@xmath11 error on the data .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the differences between the gmos and sdss photometric systems are not significant for the analysis presented below .      during the whole outburst period ,",
    "when the source was at or close to its maximum brightness , the optical colors remained approximately constant . in fig .",
    "[ colplot ] we show the trend in these colors over the monitoring period . the available sdss pre - outburst colors ( r-i and i-z ) are also shown as horizontal lines at the right edge of the plot .",

    "[ ccplot ] we show the optical r-i and i-z colors plotted in a two color diagram .",

    "the three points labeled 3702 , 3729 , and 3740 are the source colors at those mjds and are from the decline phase .",
    "these points are significantly closer to the pre - outburst color than those during the outburst . in this plot",

    "these vectors represent a visual extinction a@xmath12=5 magnitudes .",
    "we have used the tabular data of d.  finkbeiner ( private communication ) to calculate the effective change in r-i and i-z colors over the a@xmath12 range plotted .",

    "the sdss  1135 color into the dwarf locus suggests a spectral type of late - k to early m dwarf . during the outburst phase and through the decline phase ,",
    "the colors of v1647  ori first become more blue and then more red .",
    "this can be explained by either one , or a combination , of effects . either a change in intrinsic source color or a color _ and _ extinction change has occurred .",
    "we explore this effect in a plot of reddening invariant colors vs. time shown in fig .",
    "[ colq ] . reddening invariant colors",
    "are , as the name suggests , colors that do not change as extinction along the line - of - sight changes .",

    "( 2004 ) , the reddening invariant color we use , q@xmath13 is defined as    @xmath14    here we chose the standard interstellar value of r@xmath12=3.1 , however , we note that the change in q@xmath13 for somewhat larger grains , e.g. r@xmath12=5.5 , is relatively small ( @xmath310% ) when compared to the associated uncertainties on the measurements . in fig .",
    "[ colq ] we perhaps see a slight trend in q@xmath13 suggesting a larger value as the eruption proceeds into the decline phase .",
    "however , the change in value is a small effect with respect to the associated errors .",
    "if this difference is real , it would suggest that the intrinsic colors of the source are different out of outburst than in outburst .",
    "such a color change is anticipated due to the added optical continuum luminosity from the enhanced accretion during the outburst ( mcgehee et al .",

    "mcgehee ( private communication ) has subsequently produced a version of this plot for us showing the variation in q@xmath13 up to t@xmath15=10000  k. we do not wish to over - interpret the current dataset due to the associated errors , however , comparing the q@xmath13 value with the aforementioned plot , suggests that in its eruptive state the t@xmath15 of the optical emission from v1647  ori determined from its observed q@xmath13 value ( @xmath30.35@xmath100.15 ) is in the range 30004000  k. distinguishing between different surface gravities in this plot would be impossible since the range of q@xmath13 values for log(g ) of 3.5 and 5.5 at this t@xmath15 is 0.25 to 0.35 , respectively . unfortunately , we note that the sdss pre - eruption value of q@xmath13 from mcgehee et al .",
    "( 2004 ) is of relatively poor quality ( q@xmath13=0.25@xmath100.23 ) due to the faintness of v1647  ori in r in november 1998 ( mjd  1135 , r@xmath323.04@xmath100.22 ) and is therefore not considered further .      in order to produce as complete a light curve of the 20032006 outburst of v1647  ori as possible , we have combined our photometry with selected published results . in fig .",

    "this results in a transformation correction of 0.79 magnitudes . additionally , since the software aperture used by briceo et al .",

    "we note here that the generally accepted interpretation of such na  i line structure is that an intense stellar wind , resulting from enhanced accretion , forms shell - like expanding / outflow structures which are accelerated close to the star / disk and slow with increasing distance ( bastian & mundt 1985 ; reipurth et al .",

    "we can not resolve individual shell components .",
    "however , the large line width and the blue - shifted nature of the absorption implies in itself that we are seeing considerable outflowing material with a significant velocity gradient . if the absorption feature at 5877    is indeed a high - velocity blue - shifted na component , then within one month ( 2004 february 14 to march 10 ) the wind dramatically increases in density ( line depth ) and velocity ( line width / range ) with a maximum of over 600  km  s@xmath4 . for a spherically symmetric wind",
    ", the fact that we do not observe a symmetric profile , one with both blue - shifted and red - shifted absorption , suggests that we only have an unobscured line - of - sight towards the absorbing material that is expanding towards us .",
    "this is likely the result of obscuration by the circumstellar / accretion disk and implies that the material lies close to the star and is accelerated , in this location , to high velocities ( see the discussion of bastian & mundt 1985 for more details ) .",
    "this is consistent with the inferred inclination of the axis of the nebula ( mcneil s nebula ) to the line - of - sight of @xmath360@xmath22 ( acosta - pulido et al .",

    "if such a periodicity is present in broad - band optical photometry or w@xmath35 , or both , then it is clearly an important phenomenon for investigating the physics occurring during the v1647  ori outburst . in our spectroscopic data , we perhaps see some temporal structure that could be interpreted as periodic in nature . for example , in the period september 2004 to january 2005 , the variations appear reasonably well phased with the data of walter et al .",
    "( open squares ) .",
    "however , with so few observations ( five ) and their temporal spacing , we can not confirm that such periodic variability exists .",
    "what we can do is characterize the shortest timescale upon which variability is found . to do this",
    ", we consider the minimum separation between consecutive observations ( combining all data points ) which show statistically significant variability and we adopt a @xmath2710% change in w@xmath35 as indicating statistical significance .",
    "there exists in the data only one date ( mjd  3378 ) when observations were taken less than 1 day of each other ( i.e. on the same night ) . upon this date ,",
    "the w@xmath31 values are consistent to better than 10% .",
    "next , there are three occurrences of consecutive observations separated by 1 day ( i.e. taken on consecutive nights ) and in all three cases variability was not detected at the @xmath2710% level .",
    "the shortest time interval over which a @xmath2710% change in w@xmath35 is detected is 3 days .",
    "specifically , between mjd  3066 and 3069 , w@xmath35 changed by + 6    ( from @xmath340   ) , a change of @xmath315% .",
    "we conclude that , from the limited data available , variability in w@xmath35 is present in v1647  ori on timescales as short as 3 days .",
    "after the period of relatively constant w@xmath35 ( february 2004 to september 2005 ) , w@xmath35 begins to change dramatically as the major photometric decline phase starts . by the time",
    "the source has faded to close to its pre - outburst brightness ( february 2006 ) , w@xmath35 has increased to about 100   .",
    "the most obvious cause for such a dramatic change is the decrease in continuum emission as the source faded . from september 2005 to february 2006",
    "the observed r band magnitude decreased by @xmath34 magnitudes or a factor 40 .",
    "if the h@xmath0 flux remained constant during this period then we would expect w@xmath35 to have increased by a factor 40 from @xmath330    to 1200   . since the increase in w@xmath35 was measured to be only a factor @xmath33.3",
    ", we can conclude that the h@xmath0 emission flux must have significantly decreased from september 2005 to february 2006 .",
    "we estimate this decline to be about a factor @xmath312 .",
    "if the h@xmath0 emission is proportional to the mass accretion rate then this decline would correspond to an order of magnitude decrease in accretion from september 2005 to february 2006 . using the relationship between near - ir h  i emission line flux and accretion rate defined by muzerolle et al .",
    "( 1998a ) , acosta - pulido et al .",
    "( 2007 ) estimated that the mass accretion rate declined from @xmath35@xmath3710@xmath38  m@xmath7  yr@xmath4 in march 2004 to @xmath35@xmath3710@xmath39  m@xmath7  yr@xmath4 in may 2006 .",
    "this factor 10 reduction in accretion rate is consistent with the 12@xmath37 reduction in h@xmath0 emission flux we observe between similar dates .",
    "the fwzi of h@xmath0 emission can be considered a measure of twice the maximum velocity h@xmath0 emitting gas attains in the process of line creation .",
    "however , we note that this quantity is not just affected by bulk gas motion , since line broadening can occur .",
    "muzerolle , calvet , & hartmann ( 1998 ) suggested that stark broadening could be an important mechanism in producing very large line widths .",
    "muzerolle et al .",
    "( 2001 ) presented model h@xmath0 line profiles under the influence of stark broadening by considering a realistic range of physical parameters related to the accretion process , magnetosphere size , inclination angle , and stellar mass and temperature .",
    "a comparison of h@xmath0 line profiles both with and without stark broadening ( and continuum opacity ) showed that this effect can be a significant contributory factor with an increase of up to 2.5@xmath37 in fwzi .",
    "their consideration of such broadening resulted in line profiles that better matched those observed in t  tauri stars .",
    "stark broadening requires optically thick conditions and very high densities ( n@xmath4010@xmath41  @xmath26 ) , both of which are found in post - shock regions of hot accretion shocks ( hartigan et al .",
    "1991 ; valenti , basri , & johns 1993 ) .    as mentioned above",
    ", one problem with studying fwzi is signal to noise ( henceforth s : n ) .",
    "poor s : n can mask the true wavelength at which line emission fades to the continuum level . in the case of v1647  ori",
    ", this is particularly important in the later spectra when the source had faded below r=20 .",
    "table  [ haprof ] shows the s : n at both i@xmath32 and in the adjacent continuum for all spectra .",
    "fwzi is likely a good measure of velocity width from february 2004 to the summer of 2005 where the s : n in the continuum is always @xmath2720 .",
    "however , after this time the continuum s : n drops to @xmath255 . alternatively",
    ", fw2.5% of h@xmath0 emission has been considered ( by rpl96 ) to be a measure of line width less sensitive to s : n since it does not require a precise definition of continuum level .",
    "this is due to fw2.5% being of a larger signal level and hence insensitive to continuum s : n issues .",
    "rpl96 observed a significant number ( 63 ) of young low- and intermediate - mass stars at high spectral resolution ( r@xmath350000 ) and presented h@xmath0 line profiles for each .",
    "the profiles were divided into four classes ( type i ",
    "iv ) depending on the asymmetry of the line profile , and the location and depth of any associated absorption .",
    "the reader is referred to rpl96 for the detailed definitions of the classes .    the changes occurring in fwzi and fw2.5% with time ( middle - left panel of fig .",
    "[ haplot3 ] ) mirror each other reasonable well from february 2004 to the middle of 2005 .",
    "this suggests that our measurement of fwzi is most likely accurate . in the above time period ,",
    "fw2.5% is @xmath31.4@xmath37 smaller than fwzi .",
    "subsequently , however , the fwzi and fw2.5% values become much more similar suggesting that our values of fwzi are likely underestimates due to poor s : n and that the trend seen in fwzi is not purely intrinsic to the star . if we measure the fwzi and fw2.5% of a pure gaussian profile we find that fw2.5% is a factor 1.515 smaller than fwzi .",
    "hence , the red wing of h@xmath0 in v1647  ori between february 2004 and mid-2005 have fwzi and fw2.5% values of close to the gaussian ratio value .",
    "we have therefore multiplied the fw2.5% values from august 2005 onwards by a factor 1.515 and these are displayed in fig .",
    "[ haplot3 ] ( middle - left panel ) as the fwzi values .",
    "fw2.5% decreases during 2004 from a maximum close to 1000  km  s@xmath4 ( fwzi@xmath31400  km  s@xmath4 ) to @xmath3750  km  s@xmath4 ( fwzi@xmath31100  km  s@xmath4 ) . after this time",
    ", the decrease in fw2.5% ceases and from 2005 onwards it remains at @xmath3750  km  s@xmath4 ( scaled fwzi@xmath31150  km  s@xmath4 ) .",
    "hence , through the major decline phase of v1647  ori until it reaches its pre - outburst brightness , fw2.5% remains approximately constant .",
    "we note that the values encountered in v1647  ori throughout the eruption are considerably larger ( by a factor @xmath33@xmath37 ) than those found in cttss suggesting that accretion activity has not declined completely to a quiescent level .",

    "fig .  9 of rpl96 shows that of their 63 sources , the peak in the distribution of ( red wing ) fw2.5% values lies at @xmath3600  km  s@xmath4 with only three stars showing values greater than 1000  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "hence , even when v1647  ori had faded to its pre - outburst brightness , its fw2.5% value remained larger than the rpl96 distribution peak .",
    "the three sources that rpl96 found to have fw2.5%@xmath271000  km  s@xmath4 were r  mon , fw  cha , and as  353a .",
    "these sources were all classified as iii - b in the rpl96 scheme possessing blue - shifted absorption . in total , 15 of their 63 sources showed type iii - b profiles .",
    "the h@xmath0 profiles of v1647  ori suggests that its rpl96 classification evolved with time from i ) iv - b in february / march 2004 , to ii ) iii - b in september / october 2004 , to iii ) iv - b in november / december 2004 , to iv ) iii - b in january 2005 through to at least october 2005 and possibly beyond to february 2007 ( although the s : n of the spectra are too poor to be definite ) .      the width of the blue - shifted absorption feature ( herein termed @xmath18v ) and the velocity of the center of the blue - shifted absorption ( herein termed v@xmath33 ) gives us information on the velocity field of the outflowing absorbing gas . specifically , we consider that we can associate @xmath18v with the velocity dispersion in the ejected material , and v@xmath33 with its characteristic velocity .",
    "the temporal variability of @xmath18v ( middle - right panel of fig .  [ haplot3 ] ) is considerably different from that of the h@xmath0 emission component .",
    "a very rapid decline in absorption width is seen between our first two observations taken in february 2004 ( @xmath18v@xmath3600  km  s@xmath4 ) and march 2004 ( @xmath18v@xmath3300  km  s@xmath4 ) . after this time , @xmath18v is approximately constant to the end of our winter 20042005 monitoring season . at the start of the fall 2005",
    "observing period , @xmath18v has decreased to @xmath3100  km  s@xmath4 and there is some suggestion that this decrease was related to the main photometric decline . during the fall / winter months of 2005 , @xmath18v remains approximately constant although the s : n of the spectra is poor .",
    "the final observation point , february 2007 , also had very low s : n but the indication is that the value of @xmath18v had changed little .",
    "the velocity offset of the deepest absorption , v@xmath33 ( bottom - left panel , dashed line ) , mirrors @xmath18v showing a similar large change between the first two observations ( from @xmath3500  km  s@xmath4 to @xmath3300  km  s@xmath4 ) .",
    "this is followed by a slower decline ( to @xmath3200  km  s@xmath4 ) between the spring and fall of 2004 . in the fall of 2005 v@xmath33",
    "had again decreased , this time by a factor @xmath32 ( to @xmath42100  km  s@xmath4 ) . by early 2006 , when v1647  ori had returned to its pre - outburst brightness , the s :",
    "n of the spectra and the weakness of the absorption made a determination of v@xmath33 difficult and all we can say is that it was @xmath42100  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the wavelength of peak h@xmath0 emission is a rather complex quantity since it is dependent not only on the motion of the emitting material , but also on the characteristics of any associated absorption .",
    "for example , if a blue - shifted wind absorbs the blue wing of the emission line then the wavelength of peak emission can shift to the red . alternatively ,",
    "if the blue - shifted absorption is weak and we measure a wavelength shift in peak emission , then we could interpret this as evidence for bulk motion of the emitting gas .",
    "multiple absorption components , as we saw in fig .",

    "the peak had shifted back to its original wavelength ( of february / march 2004 ) . when our monitoring commenced again in the fall of 2005 , @xmath34 was at about the same wavelength as in spring 2005 but soon after it shifted briefly to the blue and then rapidly to the red and by the spring of 2006 it was located redward of the rest wavelength by @xmath31.7    ( @xmath380  km  s@xmath4 ) .",
    "this trend continued until our last observation , in february 2007 , when @xmath34 was at + 2.5    ( @xmath3120  km  s@xmath4 ) .",
    "it is generally agreed that the presence of complex h@xmath0 emission structure with blue - shifted absorption in the spectrum of a young star is the result of the combination of emission from magnetospheric accretion and absorption from strong , dense stellar winds .",

    "( 2007 ) discuss models involving such processes and their fit to observations of low - mass stars .",
    "it is clearly important to consider such numerical simulations to available datasets to allow the derivation of physical parameters such as outflow and accretion rates , and test the validity of the specific models .",
    "however , due to the complexity of such analyses in regions of high accretion ( kurosawa , private communication ) , what follows will concentrate on a qualitative understanding of the changes observed .",
    "the eruptive event that commenced between 2003 october 23 and 2003 november 15 ( briceo et al .",
    "2004 ) resulted in the dramatic brightening of v1647  ori and the appearance of what is now known as mcneil s nebula .",
    "the event was apparently extremely violent since about three months after the outburst occurred ( when our first observations were taken ) the star had optically brightened by a factor @xmath3100 and produced a p  cygni h@xmath0 profile exhibiting both a very high velocity ( @xmath3600  km  s@xmath4 ) , blue - shifted , absorption trough ( indicative of the presence of a dense wind ) _  and _ strong emission with an enormous velocity width ( i.e. fwzi@xmath31500  km  s@xmath4 - indicative of magnetospheric accretion and perhaps stark broadening ) .",
    "how these h@xmath0 spectral features evolved over the first three months of the eruption is unknown , however , they are likely to be at least similar in nature to those observed at three months old if not even more extreme .",
    "below , we summarize what we can deduce from our results regarding the properties and evolution of the wind and accretion phenomena .",
    "at the three month mark of the eruption , a strong wind existed producing two minima in the blue - shifted absorption ( see fig .",
    "[ haplot2 ] ) .",
    "such a double - trough absorption profile was evident at times , for example , in the spectra of v1057  cyg , a classical fuor ( see bastian & mundt 1985 ) .",
    "however , the two components of the wind disappeared between our first and second observations on ut 2004 february 14 and ut 2004 march 10 , respectively .",
    "the optical spectrum of ojha et al .",
    "( 2005 ) from ut 2004 february 22 did not show such features either .",
    "the two minima in the h@xmath0 absorption on ut 2004 february 14 , were at velocities of v= 270 , and 530  km  s@xmath4 with respect to the rest wavelength of h@xmath0 ( 6562.8  @xmath21 m ) .",
    "on ut 2004 march 10 , the single absorption minimum was at v=  350  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "a double - peaked absorption could be associated with multiple shell - like wind components ejected with different velocities or with the geometry and motion of the emission region .",
    "a continuing slowing of the wind is indicated by the v@xmath33 values plotted in fig .",
    "[ haplot3 ] where the velocity of the absorption minimum declined from a maximum of 530  km  s@xmath4 to a minimum of 150  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the width of the absorption component , @xmath18v , also declined over this period ( from 560 to 100  km  s@xmath4 ) indicating a reduction in velocity dispersion in the wind and suggesting that the wind decelerated as it expanded away from v1647  ori .",
    "such behavior is perhaps consistent with the stochastic wind models of grinin & mitskevich ( 1992 ) and mitskevich , natta , & grinin ( 1993 ) . in these models",
    "the wind is non - isotropic and clumpy and decelerates at large distances from the young star .      during the period of rapid decline of v@xmath33 , i.e. between 2004 february 14 and march 10 ,",
    "the fwzi of the h@xmath0 emission remained relatively constant at @xmath31500  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "as we saw above , such a value is somewhat larger than typically found in accreting classical t  tauri stars ( from the work of rpl96 ) .",
    "additional examples of this are rw  aur , which exhibited a fwzi of @xmath31000  km  s@xmath4 in the spectra of alencar et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and some sources studied by muzerolle , hartmann , & calvet ( 1998 ) and alencar & basri ( 2000 ) where a typical fwzi was found to be in the range 600 to 1000  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the fwzi did not show significant decline until sometime between our observation in march 2004 and our next observation in september 2004 . over this period",
    "the fwzi had reduced by around 500  km  s@xmath4 ( to @xmath31000  km  s@xmath4 ) . during the period of the major photometric decline , from august 2005 to february 2006 , the fwzi remained in the range 10001400  km  s@xmath4 ,",
    "i.e. the dramatic change in optical brightness of v1647  ori did not appear to be strongly correlated with the fwzi of the h@xmath0 emission .",
    "this argues that the optical fading and the h@xmath0 emission are not the result of the same physical processes .",
    "as we related above , contributions to the fwzi of the h@xmath0 emission probably arise in both bulk gas motion and stark broadening .",
    "the region of h@xmath0 emission therefore much be extremely dense and suggests that it is the post - shock region of the accretion shock .",
    "the change in optical colors as the major photometric decline phase began ( they became redder ) suggests that there was a reduction in blue continuum from the accretion shock region .",
    "briceo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) observed the spectrum of v1647  ori using reflected light from mcneil s nebula and found it to correspond to that from an early b - type source i.e. the hot accretion shock .",
    "correspondingly , the reduction in blue continuum likely resulted from of a decline in post - shock temperature and density , probably due to a slowing of the accretion rate .",
    "the decline in accretion rate was estimated , using near - ir h lines , to be an order of magnitude between march 2004 and may 2006 ( acosta - pulido et al .",

    "2009 ) together with a luminosity increase due to the addition of significant hot accretion flux .",
    "the brightening in the nir is perhaps more likely the effect of irradiation and subsequent heating of the inner regions of the circumstellar disk , beyond the sublimation radius , by uv flux from the accretion flow .",
    "however , it is clear that the heating did not propagate through to outer regions of the disk since the sub - mm / mm flux remained unchanged .",

    "statistically significant brightness fluctuations were seen on periods as short as a few days . during this so - called `` high - plateau '' phase ,",
    "the optical spectrum of v1647  ori showed strong p  cygni h@xmath0 emission on a relatively stable continuum .",
    "this suggests that the accretion process continued unabated over this period with only minor variations occurring .",
    "this is supported by the reasonably constant fwzi of h@xmath0 ( @xmath31500  km  s@xmath4 ) , indicating that the emission was taking place in very dense gas , and the derived accretion rate from nir line emission . during this same period ,",
    "the wind quickly slowed ( from v@xmath45600  km  s@xmath4 to 200  km  s@xmath4 ) . also , the velocity dispersion in the wind mirrored v@xmath33 in that it quickly declined ( from @xmath18v@xmath3600  km  s@xmath4 to 200  km  s@xmath4 ) . during the rapid decline in wind velocity and velocity dispersion , weak shock - excited emission lines of [",

    "these remained approximately constant to the end of the monitoring period . during the summer months of 2004 , an [ o  i ] emission line appeared and strengthened for about a year .",
    "this may be the result of the formation of a partly obscured bipolar - like outflow and its formation approximately corresponded to the period of the high - plateau .",
    "subsequently , the [ o  i ] line declined in intensity which corresponded to the rapid decline in brightness of v1647  ori .",
