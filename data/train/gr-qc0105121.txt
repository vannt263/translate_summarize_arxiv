    "the last two decades have seen considerable effort being devoted to the construction of fundamental theories of nature in more than three spatial dimensions . in such models the four dimensional planck scale @xmath1 gev is related to its fundamental value @xmath2 by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the number of extra dimensions . in the original kaluza - klein picture",
    "the extra dimensions were compact and microscopic @xmath5 cm , hence unobservable .",
    "however it was soon realized that a theory in which one or more of the extra dimensions is macroscopic ( @xmath6 mm ) has several interesting features .",
    "for instance a model in which two of the extra dimensions extend up to a millimeter has the considerable advantage of decreasing the fundamental planck scale to electroweak scales @xmath7 thereby alleviating the hierarchy problem associated with particle physics @xcite .",
    "a further development of these ideas @xcite led to a scenario in which our universe is a three dimensional domain wall ( brane ) embedded in an infinite four dimensional space ( bulk ) .",
    "the metric describing the full 4 + 1 dimensional space - time is non - factorizable and the small value of the true five dimensional planck mass is related to its large effective four dimensional value by the extremely large warp of five dimensional space @xcite .",
    "since gravity and matter fields remain confined to the brane the presence of the extra ( bulk ) dimension does not affect newton s law which remains inverse square .    as demonstrated in @xcite the prospects of inflation in such a scenario improve due to the presence of an additional quadratic density term in the einstein equations .",
    "the class of potentials which lead to inflation increases and includes potentials which are normally too steep to be associated with inflation @xcite . as we demonstrate in this paper , for a suitable choice of parameter values , scalar field with steep potentials can successfully play the dual role of being the inflaton at early times and dark energy ( quintessence ) at late times ( see also @xcite ) . in inflationary models with steep potentials the immediate aftermath of braneworld inflation is characterised by a ` kinetic regime ' during which the inflaton has the ` stiff ' equation of state @xmath8 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine an important observational imprint of brane - inflation - the spectrum of relic gravity waves .",
    "the quantum mechanical creation of gravitons from the vacuum is an important generic feature of expanding cosmological models @xcite . in models characterised by an early inflationary epoch",
    "the relic gravity wave amplitude is related to the hubble parameter during inflation @xcite while its spectrum depends upon both the inflationary and post - inflationary equation of state @xcite . as demonstrated in @xcite the gravity wave amplitude in braneworld models",
    "is considerably enhanced over that in standard inflation . additionally ,",
    "as we show in this paper , the presence of a kinetic regime soon after brane - inflation leads to a ` blue ' spectrum for gravity waves , on scales smaller than the comoving horizon scale at the commencement of the radiative regime ( see also @xcite ) . this unique feature of steep braneworld inflation results in an enhanced gravity wave background which can be used to succesfully constrain braneworld models .",

    "the equation of motion of a scalar field propogating on the brane is @xmath15 from ( [ eq : frw2 ] ) and ( [ eq : kg ] ) we find that the presence of the additional term @xmath16 increases the damping experienced by the scalar field as it rolls down its potential .",
