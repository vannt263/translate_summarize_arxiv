    "in this paper we are working on the energy critical nonlinear wave equation in 3 + 1 dimension in a domain @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a non - trapping obstacle with smooth boundary @xmath2 which enjoys the conservation of energy @xmath3 in the boundaryless case ( @xmath4 ) , the first results for the global existence were obtained by grillakis ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "he showed that there are global smooth solutions of the critical wave equation , if the data is smooth .",
    "shatah and struwe ( @xcite , @xcite ) extended this theorem by showing that there are global solutions for the data lying in the energy space @xmath5 .",
    "they also obtained results for critical wave equation in higher dimensions .",
    "for the case of obstacles , the first results were due to smith and sogge @xcite .",
    "they showed that grillakis theorem extends to the case where @xmath6 is the complement of a smooth , compact , strictly convex obstacle with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "this result was later extended to the case of arbitrary domains in @xmath7 and data in the energy space by burq , lebeau and planchon @xcite .",
    "the case of the nonlinear critical neumann wave equation in 3-dimensions was subsequently handled by burq and planchon @xcite .",
    "more specifically , in this paper we are interested in asymptotics , i.e. how solutions to the nonlinear equation scatter to a solution to the homogeneous linear equation . in the boundaryless case ( @xmath8 ) ,",
    "first results were obtained by bahouri - grard in @xcite ; in their paper they used the following decay estimate proved by bahouri - shatah @xcite @xmath9 to get @xmath10 and thus scattering .",
    "moreover , in @xcite bahouri - grard used profile decomposition to show that @xmath11 is also controlled by a universal function of the energy @xmath12.then the scattering result was extended to the case of star - shaped obstacles ( @xmath13 for @xmath14 with @xmath15 the outward pointing unit normal vector to @xmath16 ) by blair , smith , and sogge in @xcite .",
    "they used the same @xmath17 decay estimate proved by bahouri - shatah in @xcite after they extended it to their case of obstacles making slight modifications on the proof to handle the boundary term .    in the papers by bahouri - shatah @xcite and blair , smith , and sogge @xcite , the @xmath17 decay estimate which is the main key to prove scattering",
    "was proved using the method of multipliers .",
    "the method of multipliers is also called friedrichs abc method as it dates back to kurt o. friedrichs in the 1950 s . the idea of this method is to multiply the equation with a factor @xmath18 , with @xmath19 is a linear first - order differential operator , defined as @xmath20 and then to express the product as a divergence or energy identity of the form @xmath21 and finally to integrate this divergence identity over a domain in @xmath22 and subsequently derive the required estimates . the only case where the differential multiplier is adapted to both the wave equation in terms of commutation ( avoiding remaining terms ) and the geometry of the obstacle in terms of the sign of the boundary term , is the star - shaped case .",
    "the method of multipliers was used in the 1960 s and 1970 s to prove uniform decay results for the homogeneous linear wave equation ( @xmath23 ) outside obstacles .",
    "cathleen s. morawetz was the first to succeed in proving uniform local energy decay for star - shaped obstacles with dirichlet boundary condition using this method ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "since then , the results of morawetz have been considerably improved .",
    "better decay rates have been achieved ( as in odd dimensions @xmath24 , huygen s principle has been shown to imply an exponential rate of decay whenever there is some sort of decay @xcite , @xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "the class of obstacles under consideration has been enlarged ; decay results have been derived for a special case of non trapping obstacles referred to as almost star - shaped regions(ivrii @xcite ) and for non trapping obstacles with simple and direct geometrical generalizations to the star - shaped such as the illuminated from interior(bloom and kazarinoff @xcite ) and the illuminated from exterior(bloom and kazarinoff @xcite , liu @xcite ) . for these cases ,",
    "decay results have been proved using the method of multipliers after generalizing the multipliers to suit the geometry of the obstacle , and although these generalized multipliers lead to volume integrals that were avoided before , it turned out that these integrals were actually useful in the estimates .",
    "other wider generalizations that include all the above geometries later followed , strauss @xcite proved uniform local energy decay for the homogeneous linear wave equation in exterior domains in @xmath25 , provided a strictly expansive vector field ( now called the straussian vector field ) exists , that leaves @xmath26 strictly invariant , then these straussian vector fields were generalized by morawetz , ralston , and strauss @xcite by introducing escape functions , using them to construct a pseudo - differential operator @xmath27 , and finally setting @xmath28 as a multiplier .",
    "though the microlocal methods of morawetz , ralston , and strauss provided general results for the linear case , they can not be easily extended to the nonlinear wave equation for which the star - shapedness has been so far a restriction to obtain decay results .",
    "thus , we consider in this paper obstacles with explicit geometry that is a direct generalization of the star - shapedness , and we prove the @xmath17 decay estimate and thus the scattering for such obstacles using friedrichs abc method after generalizing the multipliers to suit our case . the price to pay for such",
    "a generalization is that the our multiplier , which is adapted to the geometry of the obstacle , no longer has exact commutation properties with the wave operator .",
    "therefore , unlike the star - shaped case we do get volume integrals that we deal with using a gronwall - like argument .",
    "our main results are :    [ l6decay ] suppose @xmath29 solves the nonlinear wave equation and that @xmath1 is a non - trapping obstacle with regular boundary that can be illuminated from its exterior by a strictly convex body @xmath30 satisfying the geometric condition : @xmath31 where    * @xmath32 is the algebraic distance from @xmath33 to @xmath14 along the exterior normal to @xmath33 .",
    "* @xmath34 where @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) are the radii of curvature of @xmath33 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "then @xmath38    we can construct obstacles that are illuminated from the exterior or from the interior that satisfy the condition .",
    "in particular , it would be easy to see this for illuminated from interior obstacles , where the illuminating body is inside the obstacle and thus @xmath39 , by considering a dog bone like obstacle ( figure [ fig : dogbone ] ) that is a small perturbation of the star - shaped .",
    "remark that if the data has compact support , the computation that proves the above result provides an explicit decay rate for the local energy . in particular , it recovers bloom - kazarinoff for the linear equation ( @xcite ) without using the fact that @xmath40 .    as a result of this decay estimate",
    ", we get scattering    [ scattering ] suppose @xmath29 solves the nonlinear wave equation and that @xmath1 is a non - trapping obstacle with regular boundary that can be illuminated from its exterior by a strictly convex body satisfying the geometric condition : @xmath41 then there exists unique solutions @xmath42 to the homogeneous linear problem @xmath43 such that @xmath44 moreover , @xmath29 satisfies : @xmath45    * acknowledgements*. i would like to thank fabrice planchon for suggesting the problem and commenting on the manuscript .",
    "we consider in this paper illuminated from exterior obstacles , defined as such ( liu @xcite ) :    [ exterior ] we say that the boundary of an exterior domain @xmath46 ( or the obstacle @xmath1 ) can be illuminated from the exterior if and only if there exists a convex body @xmath30 containing @xmath16 with smooth boundary @xmath33 such that @xmath16 is filled by a family of non - intersecting rays normal to @xmath33 .",
    "each ray is completely contained in @xmath6 in the following sense : for each @xmath47 there exists a unique @xmath48 and a number @xmath49 such that @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the outward unit normal to @xmath33 at @xmath52 , and @xmath53    this definition actually generalizes the following definition of illuminated from interior obstacles introduced by bloom and kazarinoff @xcite :    [ illuminated ] we say that a body @xmath1 can be illuminated from the interior if and only if there exists a smooth convex body @xmath30 inside @xmath1 such that @xmath54 is filled by a family of non - intersecting rays normal to @xmath33 and such that each ray intersects @xmath16 exactly once .",
    "in fact , every body that can be illuminated from the interior can also be illuminated from its exterior by enlarging the original convex body ( liu @xcite ) ; thus our results proven for illuminated from exterior obstacles also hold for illuminated from interior . furthermore ,",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , these geometries are direct generalizations of the star - shaped .",
    "more precisely , the illuminated from interior is a generalization of the strict star - shapedness ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the condition @xmath55 implies that each ray beginning at the origin intersects @xmath16 exactly once , which means that the interior of a strictly star - shaped obstacle can be illuminated by a source of light situated at the origin . a small ball centered at the origin",
    "is contained in the interior of @xmath1 and the above light rays are perpendicular to the surface of this ball , hence our strictly star - shaped is illuminated from its interior by this ball.an example of a non star - shaped body that can be illuminated from interior is a dog bone(figure [ fig : dogbone ] ) , and a snake - shapedbody ( figure [ fig : snake ] ) is an example of an obstacle that can not be illuminated from its interior but can be illuminated from the exterior .              in this section",
    "we will introduce the coordinate system that we are going to use which is the one in the paper by liu @xcite in which he was dealing with similar obstacle for the linear equation .",
    "we again denote by @xmath33 the smooth and convex surface of the illuminating body .",
    "let @xmath56 be cartesian coordinates in @xmath57 with the origin inside @xmath30 and @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath58 is on @xmath33 , then in a neighborhood of @xmath58 we choose the parametric curves to be the two principal curves on @xmath33 .",
    "if the neighborhood of @xmath58 is an all - umbilic surface , then we still can choose the parametric curves to be orthogonal to each other .",
    "furthermore , we let the parameters be the arc - length parameters .",
    "thus , if @xmath59 , then @xmath58 is given in local coordinates by @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the parameterizations of the arc - length of the principal curves near @xmath58 .",
    "a finite number of @xmath63 coordinate patches cover @xmath33 .",
    "next , corresponding to each point @xmath64 on @xmath33 , we make the choice @xmath65 , where @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the unit exterior normal to @xmath33 , with @xmath68 . by definition [ exterior ] , for each @xmath69 , there is a unique triple @xmath70 with @xmath71 such that @xmath72 we denote by @xmath73 and @xmath74 the principal curvatures at @xmath64 and @xmath75 the radii of curvature of @xmath33 .",
    "we assume @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "furthermore , we always assume that @xmath78 this condition implies that for every @xmath79 , we have @xmath80 ( @xmath36 ) since @xmath81 with @xmath82 , where @xmath32 corresponds to the point on @xmath16 associated with @xmath58 .",
    "generically , definition [ exterior ] implies the condition ( @xcite page 26 lemma 2.1 , @xcite page 316 remark after lemma 1 ) .",
    "moreover , note that for a star - shaped obstacle , which is in fact an obstacle that is illuminated from the exterior by some ball @xmath83 , @xmath84 is nothing but @xmath85 .",
    "this explains the significance of this value and makes the need of such an assumption in a computation that is a generalization of the star - shaped totally logical .",
    "now , we state the following geometrical lemma that we will use later :    [ a0 ] there exist a constant @xmath86 such that @xmath87 .",
    "the existence of @xmath88 is due to the boundedness of the the obstacle @xmath1 and the illuminating body @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) then @xmath91 where @xmath92 and if @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) then @xmath95 for some positive constant @xmath96 .",
    "we also recall the following lemmas about the coordinate system , these lemmas were originally stated and proved by bloom and kazarinoff @xcite for illuminated from interior obstacles , and then they were extended by liu @xcite for illuminated from exterior obstacles .",
    "[ lemma1 ] the level surfaces @xmath97 , @xmath98 @xmath99 define a set of local coordinate systems in @xmath26 with each ray @xmath100 normally incident on @xmath33 and @xmath101 where @xmath102 .",
    "[ lemma2 ] @xmath103 on @xmath16 .",
    "[ expressions ] we recall the following calculus formulas that we will use in our computation @xmath99 : @xmath104 and thus @xmath105 moreover , remark that for any scalar function @xmath106 and every vector field written in the new coordinate system @xmath107 we can express the gradient and the divergence as follows : @xmath108 and @xmath109\\ ] ] in particular , we have @xmath110 @xmath111 @xmath112 denote by @xmath113 and @xmath114 thus @xmath115",
    "we must show that for any @xmath116 , there exists @xmath117 such that whenever @xmath118 , @xmath119 first , we begin by multiplying the wave equation @xmath120 by @xmath121 , we get the following divergence or energy identity @xmath122 where @xmath123 denotes the energy density . integrating over the region @xmath124 , where @xmath125 and @xmath126 is a positive constant chosen such that @xmath127 and the illuminating body @xmath128 , and using the divergence theorem and the dirichlet boundary condition , we get @xmath129 where the flux on the mantle is defined by : @xmath130 with @xmath131 since the solution has finite energy , we may select @xmath126 large so that the right hand side of is less than @xmath132 .",
