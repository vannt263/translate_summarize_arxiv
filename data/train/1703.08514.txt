    "these models are constructed using the image method that is usually used to solve problems in electrostatics .",
    "these structures have no boundary of the mass but as the surface mass density decreases rapidly one can define a cutoff radius , of the order of the galactic disk radius , and , in principle , to consider these disks as finite .",
    "three - dimensional models for flat galaxies were obtained by miyamoto and nagai @xcite who thickened all members of kuzmin - toomre series of disk models .",

    "several classes of exact solutions of the einstein field equations corresponding to static thin disks with or without radial pressure have been obtained by different authors @xcite .",
