    "the discovery of a light higgs boson at the lhc  @xcite completes beautifully the standard model ( sm ) description of fundamental interactions . nonetheless , a number of questions about the theoretical consistency of the theory remain unanswered , and point to the existence of some new physics around or not far from the tev scale .    in the lack of direct detection of any new particle , a worthy and rather model - independent tool for the study of beyond - standard model ( bsm ) physics is provided by lorentz and gauge - invariant effective lagrangians , which respect a given set of symmetries , including the low - energy established ones . in particular , with a light higgs observed , two main classes of effective lagrangians are pertinent , depending on how the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is assumed to be realized : linearly for elementary higgs particles or non - linearly for  dynamical \" -typically composite- ones .    in elementary higgs scenarios , the higgs particle belongs to an @xmath0 doublet @xmath1 . if the new physics scale is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the ew vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , the corresponding linear effective lagrangian contains operators weighted by inverse powers of the cutoff scale @xmath4 : the leading corrections to the sm lagrangian have then canonical mass dimension @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "a typical example of possible underlying physics are supersymmetric models .    in dynamical higgs scenarios , on the other hand ,",
    "the higgs particle is a composite field which happens to be a pseudo - goldstone boson ( gb ) of a global symmetry @xmath6 , that is broken down spontaneously to a subgroup @xmath7 at a scale @xmath8 , corresponding to the masses of the lightest strong resonances .",

    "remarkably , the effective linear and chiral lagrangians with a light higgs are in general different .",
    "there is not a one - to - one correspondence of the leading corrections of both expansions , and one expansion is not the limit of the other unless specific constraints are imposed by hand  @xcite or follow from particular dynamics at high energies  @xcite . finding signals which differentiate between these two categories may therefore provide a powerful insight to the origin of the ewsb mechanism .",
