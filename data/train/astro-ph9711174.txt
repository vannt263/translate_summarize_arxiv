    "early investigations of the galaxy s emission revealed that it extends well past the solar circle , and that , in the outer galaxy , the emission is warped systematically from its midplane in the inner galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; oort , kerr , & westerhout  1958 ) .",
    "more recent stellar ( @xcite ) , infrared ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and molecular ( @xcite ) observations have shown that these disk constituents also extend well past the solar circle and are warped similar to the layer .",
    "ionized gas occupies potentially 10% or more of the volume of the interstellar medium ( ism ) near the solar circle and is probably a dynamically important constituent ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , but its radial extent is poorly constrained .",
    "h@xmath1 measurements are limited to distances of a few kiloparsecs by interstellar absorption ( @xcite ) .",
    "the frequency at which the galactic plane becomes optically thick because of free - free absorption can indicate the extent of the disk , but for plausible disk sizes ( see below ) this frequency is less than 10  mhz and so is difficult to observe .",
    "few pulsars are known in the anticenter direction .",
    "less than ten have dispersion - measure  independent distance estimates ( @xmath3 ) and the estimated distances are less than 2  kpc ( @xcite ) ; the remainder have dms of 30125  pc  @xmath4 , consistent with distances of a few kiloparsecs ( taylor , manchester , & lyne  1993 ; @xcite ) . fluctuations in the ionized gas",

    "scattering measurements have been biased toward the inner galaxy , even for surveys of angular broadening of extragalactic sources ( e.g. , fey , spangler , & mutel  1989 ; fey , spangler , & cordes  1991 ) .",
    "only one angular broadening survey has been conducted toward the outer galaxy ( @xcite ) , and , as we illustrate below , most of the sources in that survey had galactic latitudes too large to provide effective constraints on the radial extent of the ionized galactic disk .",
    "measurements of interplanetary scintillation determine source diameters indirectly , but in general do not have sufficient resolution to provide stringent constraints .",
    "though the radial extent of the ionized gas is poorly constrained , a number of lines of evidence suggest that its radial extent may equal or exceed that of the :    * savage , sembach , & lu  ( 1995 ) find absorption along the line of sight to h  1821@xmath5643 ( @xmath6 ) . among the velocity components contributing to this absorption",

    "the disks of nearby galaxies are truncated at radii of order 2550  kpc , at which the surface density drops to @xmath11  @xmath12 ( corbelli , schneider , & salpeter  1989 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this truncation is observed even for galaxies without nearby companions and likely occurs where the disks become optically thin to the intergalactic ionizing flux ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "bland - hawthorn , freeman , & quinn  ( 1997 ) have reported the detection of ionized gas beyond the observed disk of ngc  253 .",
    "charlton , salpeter , & hogan  ( 1992 ) have proposed that at least some of the low - redshift ly@xmath1 clouds seen in quasar spectra may be due to residual in extended , nearly fully ionized disks of normal spiral galaxies .",
    "our galaxy would then be a prototypical , @xmath13 absorber .",
    "* material blown out of the galactic disk by the action of clustered supernovae may account for a fraction of high - velocity clouds and later return to the disk forming a galactic fountain ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "models of high - velocity clouds often require the material to be supported by gas pressure at large galactocentric radii , @xmath14  kpc ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "taylor & cordes  ( 1993 , hereinafter @xcite ) modelled the galactic distribution of ionized gas with three global components :    1 .",
    "an extended component with scale height of approximately 1  kpc and @xmath15 radial scale length of order 20  kpc ; 2 .",
    "an inner galaxy component with scale height of 0.15  kpc and radial scale length of 3.5  kpc ; and 3 .",
    "spiral arms , the number and shape of which were determined by appeal to radio and optical observations of regions and radio observations of and non - thermal emission .",
    "the data available to constrain the model parameters consisted of 74 pulsars with dm - independent distances , 223 scattering measurements toward pulsars , masers , and extragalactic sources , and the galactic longitude distribution for 553 pulsar dms .    because of the paucity of measurements summarized above , @xcite could place only a lower bound on the scale length of the extended component , @xmath16 .",
    "they adopted @xmath17  kpc , though @xmath18  kpc produced comparable fits to the data .",
    "moreover , they modelled the extended component as planar ; if the ionized disk does extend to 20  kpc or more , it is likely to be warped similarly to the other outer galaxy disk constituents .",
    "figure  [ fig : angle ] demonstrates that angular broadening measurements of extremely low - latitude , @xmath19 , extragalactic sources toward the galactic anticenter have the potential of constraining @xmath16 .",
    "the line of nodes of the disk is fairly constant with galactocentric radius and is near a galactic longitude of 170 , so sources toward the anticenter probably provide the longest path length through the ionized disk . extremely low - latitude sources are required because the scale height of the extended component near the solar circle is 0.88  kpc and only for sources with @xmath19 does the line of sight remain within one scale height for path lengths of 50  kpc or more .",
    "only three of the sources in dennison et al.s  ( 1984 ) survey meet this criterion ; of these , one may show excessive scattering due to an region along the line of sight and another shows complex structure making it difficult to estimate a scattering diameter .",
    "we have carried out a program of multifrequency very long baseline array ( vlba ) observations of twelve anticenter sources , seven of which have @xmath20 ( lazio & cordes  1997 , hereinafter @xcite ) .",
    "we detected all but one of the sources at one or more of our observation frequencies0.3 , 1.6 , and 5  ghz .",
    "[ fig : angle ] illustrates , the nominal resolutions of the vlba are such that 18  cm observations are sensitive to scale lengths of @xmath21  kpc and  90  cm observations should detect scattering even if @xmath22  kpc .",

    "in this section we develop a model for the distribution of free electrons in the outer galaxy .",
    "based on the close correspondence between the disk and other outer galaxy constituents ,  [ sec : intro ] , we shall use the distribution in the outer galaxy as a basis for modifying the @xcite model .",

    "the following sections explain the various quantities in more detail . as in @xcite",
    "the coordinate system has the @xmath55-axis directed parallel to @xmath56 , the @xmath57-axis directed parallel to @xmath58 , the @xmath59-axis directed toward @xmath60 , and the galactocentric radius is @xmath61 .",
    "the minimum distance between the position @xmath62 and a point on the perseus arm is denoted by @xmath63 ( see @xcite for a full description of the spiral arms ) .",
    "following @xcite we take the radial and @xmath59 dependences to be separable .",
    "we consider two functional forms for the radial dependence of the extended component , @xmath64 .",
    "the first is a @xmath65 dependence @xmath66 we shall refer to this as a @xmath65 disk .",
    "this functional form exhibits a gradual decrease in the electron density with @xmath67 ; for @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",

    "figure  [ fig : radial ] compares these functional forms with each other and with the density ( @xcite ) .",
    "our choice for these particular functional forms is motivated by a number of considerations : the @xmath65 dependence is that assumed by @xcite and so our results can be compared directly to theirs .",
    "when compared to the density , the @xmath65 disk has a slower radial fall off while the truncated disk has a faster radial fall off .",
    "these two functional forms should bracket the actual @xmath16 if the electron density distribution follows that of the .",
    "the truncated disk also allows us to model a disk with variable scattering properties .",
    "at @xmath71 there is no additional scattering .",
    "as we have written equation  ( [ eqn : radial2 ] ) , this truncation occurs because @xmath72  @xmath4 for @xmath71 .",
    "an equivalent model is one in which there is ionized gas but @xmath73 for @xmath71 .",
    "such a truncation could occur if the distribution of scattering agents decreased more rapidly with @xmath67 than does @xmath25 .",
    "finally , our estimates of @xmath16 are model dependent .",
    "comparison of the two forms allows us to assess the sensitivity of our estimates of @xmath16 to the assumed models .",
    "both functions are normalized so that @xmath74 . henceforth , we shall drop the superscripts ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) as it will be clear from the context which @xmath16 parameter we are describing .",
    "the @xmath59-dependence of the outer galaxy density distribution is allowed to differ from that of the @xcite model by two effects .",
    "first , the disk is observed to flare to larger scale heights as @xmath67 increases .",
    "we model this effect by allowing the scale height to vary with galactocentric distance , @xmath75 .",
    "the second is that the layer is warped .",
    "the actual shape of the warp is complex , with differences between the northern and southern galactic hemispheres and with an amplitude that is radially dependent ( though other tracers of the outer disk are more symmetric than the , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "because the longitude range of our data , @xmath76 , is significantly less than the 180  longitude range over which the north / south asymmetry is important , we shall ignore the asymmetry in the warp .",
    "the scattering measure is an integrated quantity , while and co measurements yield velocity information .",
    "we therefore model the outer ionized disk as a single tilted ring or torus .",
    "our approximation to the disk in the outer galaxy is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ac.geometry ] .    the disk begins to warp and flare significantly at the same radius , @xmath77  kpc .",
    "the line of nodes of the disk varies with @xmath67 , but is approximately centered on @xmath78 .",
    "the onset of the warp is assumed to occur at the same radius as the warp does . at @xmath79",
    "kpc , our model agrees with the @xcite model , with a scale height , @xmath80 , and fluctuation parameter , @xmath81 . at @xmath82",
    "kpc the disk is tilted by an angle @xmath83 with respect to @xmath84 , has a line of nodes @xmath85 , a scale height @xmath86 , and fluctuation parameter @xmath87 .",
    "the radial dependences in equations  ( [ eqn : radial1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : radial2 ] ) are continuous through @xmath88  kpc .    in the warped disk , the @xmath59-dependence and scale height in equation  ( [ eqn : ne ] ) are relative to the midplane of the gas , _ not _ to @xmath84 , cf .",

    "the corresponding @xmath59-height is @xmath93 where @xmath92 is given by @xmath94 the warped portion of the disk is assumed axisymmetric , as is the unwarped extended component .    the division between @xmath81 and @xmath87 is to allow for the possibility that the mechanism for generating or maintaining density fluctuations in the far outer galaxy may differ from that in the inner galaxy .",
    "the radius at which the transition from @xmath81 to @xmath87 occurs was chosen to be that at which the disk begins to flare and warp significantly .",
    "the key assumption utilized here is that the flaring and warping may be symptomatic of other processes which could result in a change @xmath81 to @xmath87 .",
    "the functional dependences for the spiral arm component are unaltered from the @xcite model .",

    "the source 87 gb  0558@xmath52325 has a measured diameter of approximately 4  mas at 1  ghz ( @xcite ) , a factor of two less than that predicted by the perseus arm s contribution alone ( @xcite ) . in order that our model not overpredict scattering diameters",
    ", we must modify the spiral arm component as well .",
    "of the nine parameters describing the spiral arms@xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and four fine - tuning parameters , @xmath103@xcite used dm and scattering data to fit for the first three .",
    "they appealed to other radio and optical observations in fixing @xmath97  kpc and @xmath104  kpc . in the inner galaxy @xcite used the @xmath103 to obtain better agreement between the model and observations toward the tangent points of certain spiral arms . in the @xcite model @xmath54 , the fine - tuning parameter for the perseus arm , was set to unity ; we shall allow it to vary .",
    "our justification for allowing only @xmath54 to vary is that it is the only spiral arm parameter that can be modified without affecting the model in the inner galaxy . while the nine sources from our survey in @xcite are a substantial fraction of the number of available scattering measurements toward the anticenter , cf .",
    "table  [ tab : literature ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : vlbalocs ] , the total number of scattering measurements toward the anticenter is only approximately twenty .",
    "this number is a small fraction of the nearly 300 dm and sm measurements that @xcite used to constrain the model parameters .",
    "thus , incorporating our additional measurements from @xcite into the 300 used by @xcite and repeating their analysis would not lead to any substantial change of the model in the inner galaxy .    with the above model we can now integrate @xmath105 , equation  ( [ eqn : sm ] ) , along the line of sight toward a source at @xmath106 to form .",
    "since the two components have unequal fluctuation parameters , the contribution from each component is determined separately , then summed to form the total scattering measure .",
    "the predicted angular diameter is given by equation  ( [ eqn : scattangle ] ) where the modelled sm is a function with the following parameters @xmath107 .",
    "in this section we describe how we have used the measured angular diameters ( @xcite ) to obtain scattering diameters , discuss additional scattering measurements we have used in our analysis , develop the likelihood functions we will use to constrain the model parameters , and present the results of this likelihood analysis .      for each source",
    "we have a measurement of its apparent angular diameter at one to three frequencies , @xmath108 .",
    "we assume the apparent diameter is a quadrature sum of the intrinsic and scattering diameters and model it as @xmath109 here @xmath110 and @xmath24 are the intrinsic and scattering diameters at 1  ghz , respectively . for the scattering diameter we have used the @xmath111 dependence , as is appropriate for moderately strong scattering . for a homogeneous source with a peak brightness temperature @xmath112 , @xmath113 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have considered a number of ways of using equation  ( [ eqn : appsize ] ) to solve for @xmath24 .    1 .",

    ": for sources with angular diameters measured at 18 and  90  cm , if we set @xmath113 , we have two equations in two unknowns and can solve for @xmath110 and @xmath24 .",
    "3 .   ignore scattering at high frequencies and assume homogeneous sources : at 6  cm , scattering should be unimportant for lines of sight to the outer galaxy . for those sources detected at 6  cm , we take the 6  cm diameter to be the intrinsic diameter and scale it to 1  ghz , with @xmath113 .",
    "we use the _ observed _ frequency dependence to find the 1  ghz apparent diameter from the 18 and 90  cm diameters .",
    "the scattering diameter is then found by subtracting in quadrature the scaled intrinsic diameter from the apparent diameter .",
    "4 .   ignore scattering at high frequencies : the final method also utilizes 6  cm diameters . rather than assuming @xmath113 in scaling the intrinsic diameter to 1  ghz , we solve for @xmath1 using the 6 and  18  cm diameters , assuming @xmath116  mas .",
    "then , using the 18 and  90  cm diameters to solve for the 1  ghz apparent diameter , we again subtract in quadrature the scaled intrinsic diameter from the apparent diameter .",
    "clearly not all of these methods can be used for all sources . for",
    "those sources for which multiple methods can be used , we utilize as many of the methods as possible and then adopt the estimate which places the most stringent limit on @xmath24 .",
    "in general , method  2 and method  1 produce estimates of @xmath24 that are the same within the errors .",
    "we note that using method  1 tends to bias us toward larger disk scale lengths because this method assumes that the intrinsic size makes no contribution to the measured diameter .",
    "we find 1  ghz scattering diameters or limits in the range 1.548  mas ; these are tabulated in table  [ tab : broaden ] .",
    "we augment the scattering measurements from our survey ( @xcite ) with others from the literature within the same longitude range , @xmath117 .",
    "these are summarized in table  [ tab : literature ] , scaled to 1  ghz .",
    "two kinds of scattering measurements were found in the literature : angular broadening measurements similar to those reported here and scintillation bandwidth , @xmath118 , measurements of pulsars ( @xcite ) .",

    "pulsars with dm - independent distance estimates .",
    "this class has only one member , the crab pulsar , for which a dm and scattering diameter have been measured .",
    "pulsars without dm - independent distance estimates ; 10 such sources with measured dm and @xmath119 .",
    "all of these sources are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vlbalocs ] .",
    "two of the pulsars that have a measured scintillation bandwidth will not be included in our analysis .",
    "the lines of sight to the pulsars psr  b0823@xmath526 and psr  b1112@xmath550 are likely to be dominated by local scattering material .",
    "both pulsars are closer than 0.5  kpc , closer than the inner edge of the perseus arm .",
    "our intention is to constrain the distribution of scattering material in the outer galaxy . in selecting extragalactic sources to include in our analysis ,",
    "we have focussed on sources for which scattering makes a measurable contribution the observed diameter .",
    "such sources are marked by visibility functions displaying a gaussian - like profile with increasing baseline length or by images containing only simple structures , typically a single gaussian component .",
    "an alternate approach would be include in our analysis _ all _ extragalactic sources in the anticenter .",
    "since the observed angular size is a convolution of the intrinsic size with the scattering diameter , we can always derive an upper limit to the scattering diameter for any source ( see method  1 in  [ sec : sizes ] )",
    ". however , these upper limits are usually factors of at least 510 larger than the scattering diameters predicted by the @xcite model .",
    "sources for which scattering appears to dominate the observed angular diameters suggest that the level of scattering toward the anticenter is actually less than that predicted by the @xcite model .",
    "the upper limits for the scattering diameters of most sources therefore place no meaningful constraint on the scattering toward the anticenter ( see also  [ sec : bestmodel ] ) .",
    "we illustrate the lack of constraints provided by most sources with four sources originally included in the @xcite analysis , but not included in this analysis .",
    "four extragalactic sources included in the @xcite analysis are not included here , because a re - analysis of the existing observations suggests that no scattering diameter has been measured .",
    "the four sources are cta21 ( 0316@xmath5162 ) , 0611@xmath5131 , 4c14.18 ( 0622@xmath5147 ) , and 3c190 ( 0758@xmath5143 ) . in the @xcite analysis cta21 and",

    "wilkinson et al .  ( 1979 ) suggest that the halo is responsible for the interplanetary scintillation this source exhibits at  81  mhz .",
    "the halo is also likely to be the component responsible for the aforementioned 74  mhz angular diameter .",
    "the core itself appears to be a blend of two components .",
    "a characteristic size of these blended components is about 10  mas , equivalent to an upper limit on the scattering diameter of 3.4  mas at  1  ghz ; this upper limit is more than a factor of  5 larger than the predicted @xcite scattering diameter . for 3c190 , a later multi - station vlbi experiment at  609  mhz showed it to have three components of comparable flux and similar , steep spectra with diameters of approximately 100  mas ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is not clear if one of these components dominates at  74  mhz , and hence is responsible for the aforementioned angular diameter measurement , or if resch s  ( 1974 ) observations sample a complex visibility function and his results do not represent an actual diameter at all .",
    "the equivalent upper limit on the 1  ghz scattering diameter is approximately 40  mas , nearly a factor of 100 larger than the predicted model diameter .",
    "the source  4c14.18 has a steep spectrum and a non - gaussian visibility function ( @xcite ) . by fitting a gaussian to the visibility data , they place an upper limit on the 1  ghz scattering diameter of 22  mas , more than a factor of  5 larger than that predicted by the @xcite model . the source  0611@xmath5131 was taken to have a scattering diameter of 40  mas at  408  mhz ( @xcite ) in the @xcite analysis .",
    "our new observations at  1.6 and  5  ghz show this diameter to result from the blending of at least two source components ( @xcite ) .",

    "pc ( @xcite ; @xcite ; and references within ) and @xmath216  km  s@xmath10 , @xmath217  yr . since the orbital period of a typical satellite galaxy is of order @xmath218  yr , the passage of a satellite galaxy through the outer disk will provide only a transitory source of turbulence .",
    "the distribution of molecular clouds with embedded massive star formation extends to 20  kpc ( @xcite ) , comparable to the extent of the extended ionized component .",
    "the stars embedded in these molecular clouds have spectral types of early b ( wouterloot , brand , & henkel  1988 ) .",
    "these stars are probably sufficiently powerful to produce turbulence : the pulsar b0611@xmath522 exhibits strong interstellar scintillation and the line of sight to it passes near several late o and early b stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "diffuse ionized gas in external galaxies has been detected in h@xmath1 emission ( @xcite and references within ) .",
    "this diffuse gas is presumably the equivalent of the galaxy s warm ionized medium ( @xcite ) .",
    "spangler & reynolds  ( 1990 ) showed that the scattering diameters for extragalactic sources are correlated with h@xmath1 emission , suggesting that the same ( warm ionized ) gas responsible for the h@xmath1 emission is also responsible for the scattering . in this section",
    "we compare the radial extent of the galaxy as inferred in our likelihood analysis with that determined for other galaxies .",
    "table  [ tab : external ] presents a subset of h@xmath1 measurements extracted from the literature .",
    "we restrict the list to those galaxies for which the published observations include images large enough that radial extents can be estimated reliably . the last entry in table  [ tab : external ]",
    "is our estimate , based on the likelihood results , for the radial extent of the galaxy as it would appear to an external observer .",
    "we have obtained this estimate in the following manner .",
    "the ( @xmath219 ) sensitivities for the h@xmath1 observations are typically @xmath220  @xmath206  pc .",
    "we integrated @xmath221 to produce the modelled em , @xmath222 , along a line of sight appropriate for an external observer seeing the galaxy edge on , i.e. , along the path parallel to the @xmath55-axis ( the discussion following eqn .",
    "[ [ eqn : ne ] ] describes the coordinate system ) .",
    "trial and error was sufficient to determine that , for a truncated disk , @xmath223 at @xmath224 .",
    "the radial extent of the galaxy is comparable to the radial extent of these other galaxies .    a measure of the star formation rate of the galaxy is provided by @xmath225 , the far - infrared luminosity within the optical isophotal diameter at @xmath226 magnitude .",
    "this is an imperfect measure of the star formation rate , however , as low - mass stars heating `` cirrus '' clouds can contribute to the far infrared luminosity ( @xcite ) and the optical and infrared luminosities may have different extents .",
    "although the star formation rate , as measured by @xmath225 , is a good predictor of the amount of extraplanar gas ( @xcite ) , it is not well correlated with the radial extent of h@xmath1 .",
    "for instance , the radial extent of ngc  4217 is only 25% ( 4  kpc ) smaller than that of ugc  10288 even though the star formation rate is at least a factor of three higher in ugc  10288 ; ngc  5746 has a radial extent larger than that of the galaxy even though its star formation rate is an order of magnitude less than the galaxy s .",
    "more likely , the star formation rate is determined by a quantity like the or h@xmath227 surface density .    further support for our proposal that our measurements trace the extent of the turbulent ionized disk is found by comparing the h@xmath1 emission in external galaxies ( @xcite , figs .",
    "19 ) with the molecular cloud distribution in the outer galaxy ( @xcite , fig .  4 ) .",
    "the h@xmath1 emission is concentrated toward the galaxies centers with a gradient to large radial distances .",
    "near the edge of the h@xmath1 disk , the emission becomes patchy .",
    "the molecular cloud distribution in the outer galaxy has a similar appearance ",
    "it display a strong galactocentric gradient and , for @xmath22820  kpc , the distribution is patchy .    high latitude structure in the extended component could influence our estimates for the various model parameters , in particular @xmath86 ,  [ sec : ac.results ] .",
    "the morphology of the extraplanar diffuse gas in external galaxies shows considerable variety : ngc  891 shows diffuse gas up to 4  kpc off the plane with many vertical filaments ( rand , kulkarni , & hester  1992 ) ; ugc",
    "10288 shows vertical filaments but no diffuse gas ( @xcite ) ; ngc  4278 shows patchy emission ( @xcite ) ; and ngc  4565 shows little halo diffuse gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "h@xmath1 observations of the diffuse gas in the solar neighborhood show filamentary structure ( @xcite ) and the vertical morphology of the extended component could be quite complex .",
    "we have modified the outer galaxy portion of the taylor - cordes model for the global distribution of ionized gas .",
    "our modifications are motivated by the observed warping and flaring of the , h@xmath227 , and stellar constituents of the outer galaxy .",
    "the data available to constrain the model consist of 18 sources , 9 extragalactic sources from a survey we conducted ( @xcite ) and 7 pulsars and 2 extragalactic source extracted from the literature ( table  [ tab : literature ] ) .",
    "we used a likelihood analysis to constrain the model parameters .",
    "the two most important parameters are the radial scale length of the ionized disk , @xmath16 and the strength of scattering in the perseus arm .",
    "the adopted model parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : params ] .",
    "the scattering in the perseus arm is , at most , 60% of the level seen in the inner galaxy spiral arms .",
    "this upper limit assumes that all of the scattering for sources toward @xmath229 is due to the perseus arm .",
    "our analysis favors a level of scattering less than this upper limit .",
    "we adopt a value 25% that in the inner galaxy ; the equivalent scattering diameter is 1.5  mas at  1  ghz .",
    "we considered two different radial dependences for the electron density , a smooth decrease of the electron density with galactocentric distance , equation  ( [ eqn : radial1 ] ) , and a truncated distribution , equation  ( [ eqn : radial2 ] ) .",
    "the current data can not distinguish between these two forms .",
    "the radial scale length for the ionized disk is @xmath18020  kpc , comparable to the extent that @xcite adopted with fewer anticenter measurements .",
    "we favor the truncated disk because the radial extent inferred for sites of massive star formation also appears truncated at approximately 20  kpc , as indicated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : ac.summary ] .",
    "h@xmath1 observations of external galaxies show that they have radial extents comparable to that which we infer for the galaxy .",
    "the observed scattering diameter of one extragalactic source ( 87 gb  0600@xmath52957 ) is a factor of two smaller than the modelled scattering diameter , suggesting the possibilities of holes in the scattering material .",
    "the h@xmath1 emission in the outer portions of the disks of these external galaxies also appears patchy , similar to the distribution of molecular clouds in the outer galaxy . a patchy distribution of massive star formation sites would allow the possibility of holes in the scattering material .",
    "we conclude that scattering in the outer galaxy traces star formation , as it does in the inner galaxy .",
    "the intergalactic ionizing flux and turbulence generated by satellite galaxies passing through the disk contribute little to the scattering .",
    "however , the ionized disk of the galaxy could extend to much larger radii ( @xmath230  kpc ) , comparable to that inferred from ly@xmath1 absorption systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) , if the extreme outer disk is quiescent and contributes little scattering .",
