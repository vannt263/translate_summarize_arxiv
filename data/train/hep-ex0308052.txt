    "[ s : intro ]    some theories beyond the standard model predict the existence of doubly - charged higgs bosons , @xmath1 , including in left - right symmetric models @xcite , higgs triplet models @xcite , and little higgs models  @xcite .",
    "it has been particularly emphasized that a see - saw mechanism used to obtain light neutrinos in a model with heavy right - handed neutrinos can lead to a doubly - charged higgs boson with a mass accessible to current and future colliders @xcite .",
    "a review of experimental constraints on doubly - charged higgs bosons is presented in @xcite .",
    "the pair production of doubly - charged higgs bosons has been considered in a previous opal publication @xcite , where masses less than 98.5  gev are excluded for doubly - charged higgs bosons in left - right symmetric models .",
    "delphi has obtained a limit of 97.3  gev , independent of the lifetime of the @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "it has been noted that doubly - charged higgs bosons may be singly produced in @xmath85 collisions , including in @xmath0 collisions where the @xmath86 is obtained from radiation from the other beam particle @xcite .",
    "the diagrams for the direct production are shown in figure  [ f : direct ] .",
    "doubly - charged higgs bosons would decay into like - signed lepton or vector boson pairs , or to a w boson and a singly - charged higgs boson .",
    "for masses less than twice the w boson mass , they would decay predominantly into like - signed leptons . furthermore , in most models the ww branching fraction is negligible even for larger masses @xcite , therefore the dominant decay mode , even for masses larger than twice the w boson mass , is the decay to like - signed leptons .",
    "since the @xmath1 naturally violates lepton number conservation , it can have mixed lepton flavour decay modes .",
    "additionally , the yukawa coupling of the @xmath1 to the charged leptons h@xmath87 is model dependent , and is not generally determined directly by the lepton mass , so decays to all lepton flavour combinations need to be considered .",
    "it should be particularly noted that mixed lepton flavour decays are severely constrained by rare decay searches such as @xmath88 and @xmath89 .    in this paper , we search for the single production of doubly - charged higgs bosons , assuming the decays @xmath90 using 600.7  pb@xmath91 of @xmath0 collision data with centre - of - mass energies @xmath92  189209  gev collected by the opal detector . since the production cross - section depends only on @xmath2 , the yukawa coupling of the @xmath1 to like - signed electron pairs , the search is sensitive to this quantity .",
    "we assume that the decay of a doubly - charged higgs boson into a w boson and a singly - charged higgs boson is negligible .",
    "we consider an @xmath1 which couples to right - handed particles , but the results of the direct search quoted here are also valid for an @xmath1 which couples only to left - handed particles  @xcite .",
    "all lepton flavour combinations are considered in the @xmath1 decay ( @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 ) .",
    "the lifetime of the @xmath1 can be important , and in particular is non - negligible for @xmath99 ; however , our search is not sensitive to such small yukawa couplings",
    ".    a doubly - charged higgs boson would also affect the bhabha scattering cross - section via the @xmath5-channel exchange diagram shown in figure  [ f : indirect ] , causing a change in rate and in the observed angular distribution of the outgoing electron .",
    "constraints have been derived for this process using data from lower energy colliders @xcite , but not previously from lep .",
    "in addition to the direct search results introduced above , we also derive indirect constraints on @xmath2 , the yukawa coupling of @xmath1 to electrons , using the differential cross - section of wide - angle bhabha scattering measured by opal in 688.4  pb@xmath91 of data collected at @xmath92  183209  gev .",
    "the opal detector is described in detail in  @xcite . it is a multipurpose apparatus with almost complete solid angle coverage .",
    "the central detector consists of a silicon micro - strip detector and a system of gas - filled tracking chambers in a 0.435 t solenoidal magnetic field which is parallel to the beam axis .",
    "a lead - glass electromagnetic calorimeter with a presampler surrounds the central detector . in combination with the forward calorimeters , the forward scintillating - tile counters , and the silicon - tungsten luminometer ,",
    "a geometrical acceptance is provided down to 25mrad from the beam direction .",
    "the silicon - tungsten luminometer measures the integrated luminosity using small - angle bhabha scattering events .",
    "the magnet return yoke is instrumented for hadron calorimetry , and is surrounded by several layers of muon chambers .",
    "the data samples are summarised in table  [ t : data ] .",
    ".[t : data ] _ data samples used in the direct search analysis . _ [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      in the two - lepton analysis the invariant mass of the two jets is calculated using the measured jet energies and directions , because it is not possible to use the `` angle - based '' kinematic reconstruction described in section  [ ss : analysis ] for the three - lepton analysis .",
    "the mass distribution is shown in figure  [ f : massinv ] for events passing all cuts except the like - signed charge requirement  ( a ) , and also with all cuts applied  ( b ) .",
    "no excess of events which could imply the presence of a signal is observed in the data .    in the three - lepton analysis",
    "we calculate the @xmath1 candidate reconstructed masses , @xmath100,shown in figure  [ f : massinv ] , using the `` angle - based '' kinematic reconstruction described in item  ( 3.3 ) in section  [ ss : analysis ] .",
    "the mass distributions are shown both for events passing all cuts except the like - signed charge requirement  ( c ) , and also with all cuts applied  ( d ) . additionally , as a cross - check to ensure that no di - jet mass peak present after the event reconstruction is reduced by the angle - based method , the largest di - jet mass calculated from only the track and cluster information ( section  [ ss : analysis ] ) was examined .",
    "no excess of events which could imply the presence of a signal is observed in the data .",
    "limits are set on the @xmath1 yukawa coupling @xmath2 , assuming that the sum of the branching fractions of the @xmath1 to all lepton flavour combinations is 100% .",
    "the efficiency for an arbitrary higgs boson mass is determined by linear interpolation between the simulated signal monte carlo samples .",
    "the number of observed events , together with the number of expected signal and background events from both the two - lepton and three - lepton analyses are combined using the likelihood ratio method described in @xcite , which incorporates the systematic uncertainties into the limits using a numerical convolution technique . for the purpose of extracting the limits ,",
    "a @xmath101  gev `` sliding mass window '' around the hypothetical higgs boson mass is used .",
    "events within this window are counted in data and monte carlo simulation .",
    "the hypothetical higgs boson mass is varied in 1  gev steps .",
    "the width of the mass window is chosen such that it contains most of the expected signal events .",
    "a small efficiency correction , typically around 5% for ee and @xmath94 and 10% for @xmath95 , due to this window is applied . in the two - lepton analysis for any channel containing @xmath102 leptons no mass window cut",
    "is applied , because in this channel it is not possible to reconstruct the correct mass of the doubly - charged higgs boson due to the undetected neutrinos .",
    "the limits on @xmath2 are calculated using the efficiencies determined from the pythia monte carlo samples and the production cross - sections are determined in a consistent manner using pythia ( see discussion in section  [ ss : data ] ) .",
    "no systematic uncertainty is assigned for theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the 95% confidence level limits on @xmath2 from combining both analyses are shown in figure  [ f : limyukawa](a)(c ) assuming a branching fraction of the doubly - charged higgs boson into ee , @xmath94 , @xmath95 of 100% , respectively .",
    "strictly , due to the production mechanism involving non - zero @xmath2 , exactly 100% @xmath94 or @xmath95 decays are not possible , therefore the latter limits should be considered for the case @xmath103 . in figure",
    "[ f : limyukawa](d ) , for each mass the highest limit from all possible lepton flavour combinations is shown . an upper limit on @xmath3  0.071",
    "is inferred for @xmath4  160  gev at the 95% confidence level , which is valid for all possible lepton flavour combinations in the decays .",
    "the limit is determined by the pure @xmath95 case except for masses in excess of 170  gev . for the case of",
    "pure ee decays the limit is @xmath3  0.042 , and for @xmath94 decays @xmath3  0.049 , both for @xmath4  160  gev . for the mixed flavour decay modes e@xmath104 , e@xmath102 , and @xmath98 the limit is between those for pure decays of the two involved flavours .",
    "doubly - charged higgs bosons would contribute to bhabha scattering via @xmath5-channel exchange as shown in figure  [ f : indirect ] . the born level differential cross - section for bhabha scattering including",
    "the exchange of a doubly - charged higgs boson with right - handed couplings has been calculated in  @xcite . at high masses , @xmath105 ,",
    "the cross - section is identical to that derived for four - fermion contact interactions with right - handed currents  @xcite ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) , with the replacement of @xmath108 by @xmath109 where @xmath2 is the higgs coupling to electrons is denoted @xmath110 . ] . at values of @xmath111 comparable to the centre - of - mass energy , this correspondence",
    "is modified by the inclusion of a propagator term .",
    "for comparison with the experimental data , qed radiative corrections are applied to the born level terms for doubly - charged higgs boson exchange and interference with standard model processes given in  @xcite using the program miba  @xcite .",
    "initial state radiation is calculated up to @xmath112 in the leading log approximation with soft photon exponentiation , and the @xmath113 leading log final state qed correction is applied .",
    "the bhwide  @xcite program is used to calculate the standard model contribution to the differential cross - section .",
    "the theoretical predictions are calculated using the same acceptance cuts as are applied to the data .",
    "this analysis uses opal measurements of the differential cross - section for @xmath114 at centre - of - mass energies of 183209  gev@xcite .",
    "the data between 203  gev and 209  gev are grouped into two sets with mean energies of approximately 205  gev and 207  gev .",
    "the total integrated luminosity of the data amounts to 688.4  pb@xmath115 .",
    "these measurements cover the range @xmath116 , in 15 bins of @xmath117 ( as defined in  @xcite ) , and correspond to @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the acollinearity angle between electron and positron .",
    "it is verified that the effect of doubly - charged higgs boson exchange on the low - angle bhabha scattering cross - section has a negligible effect on the luminosity determination even for values of @xmath2 a few times larger than excluded by this measurement .",
    "the measured differential cross - sections are fitted with the theoretical prediction using a @xmath120 fit .",
    "the fit is performed for fixed values of the doubly - charged higgs boson mass between 80  gev and 2000  gev , allowing the square of the coupling , @xmath121 , to vary .",
    "although only @xmath122 is physically meaningful , in order to allow for the case where the data fluctuate in the opposite direction to that expected for doubly - charged higgs boson exchange , both positive and negative values of @xmath121 are allowed in the fit .",
    "experimental and theoretical systematic uncertainties and their correlations are treated as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the fitted values of @xmath121 are consistent with zero for all masses , indicating that the data are consistent with the standard model prediction . for example",
    ", for a mass of 130  gev the fitted value of @xmath121 is 0.003@xmath1230.011 , and the fit has a @xmath120 of 97.0 for 119 degrees of freedom .",
    "figure  [ f : ee207 ] shows the ratio of the measured luminosity - weighted average differential cross - section at 183207  gev to the standard model prediction , together with the results of the fit .",
    "95% confidence level limits on the coupling as a function of mass were derived by integrating the likelihood function obtained from @xmath120 over the region @xmath122 , and are shown in figure  [ f : limindir ] .",
    "the limits are considerably more stringent than those derived from pep and petra data  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f : limyukawabhabha ] shows the limits from the indirect search together with those from the direct search .",
    "the indirect limits are less restrictive than those from the direct search at low masses , but extend to much higher masses .",
    "a direct search for the single production of doubly - charged higgs bosons has been performed .",
    "no evidence for the existence of @xmath1 is observed .",
    "upper limits are determined on the higgs yukawa coupling to like - signed electron pairs , @xmath2 .",
    "a 95% confidence level upper limit of @xmath3  0.071 is inferred for @xmath4  160  gev assuming that the sum of the branching fractions of the @xmath1 to all lepton flavour combinations is 100% .",
    "additionally , indirect constraints on @xmath2 for @xmath4  2  tev are derived from bhabha scattering where the @xmath1 would contribute via @xmath5-channel exchange for @xmath4  2  tev .",
    "these are the first results on both the single production search and constraints from bhabha scattering reported from lep .",
    "the authors would like to thank andr schning for suggesting that we perform this search , steve godfrey and pat kalyniak for valuable discussions and assistance during the preparation of this paper , and also emmanuelle perez for a helpful hint about the pythia code .",
