    "it is generally expected that a quark - gluon plasma(qgp ) can be formed after a relativistic heavy ion collision even at rhic energy .",
    "however , it has not been clear yet how a qgp is formed in a heavy ion collision , as well as what the equation of state is , if it is formed . some of these questions , which are important for the identification of signals of the qgp and of the properties of dense strongly interacting matter , are the subjects of our study .    beginning with the moment of contact of two colliding heavy ions , initially coherent quanta , which can be identified as partons , from the projectile nucleus",
    "collide with those from the target nucleus and can become incoherent particle excitations .",
    "they can , as well , produce additional particles by radiative processes @xcite",
    ". there may be several different mechanisms responsible for particle production in relativistic heavy ion collision depending on the transverse momentum of the produced particles .",
    "those of high transverse momentum , which is greater than a threshold momentum @xmath6 , are usually called minijets and can be approximately calculated by the methods of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) using the parton structure functions of the colliding nuclei . on the other hand , the `` soft '' partons of low transverse momentum , with @xmath7 ,",
    "are thought to be produced by the semi - classical decoherence of strong , random gluon fields contained in the colliding nuclei , sometimes called color glass condensate @xcite .",
    "while the primary partons of high transverse momentum ( minijets ) are produced near the central rapidity region and have relatively high transverse energy , the soft partons are distributed over a wide range of rapidities and have lower transverse energy .",
    "these soft partons can play a role as a thermal bath or background field , which slows down the minijets by inducing them to transfer a substantial fraction of their energy to the bath , thus enhancing their chance to be thermalized .",
    "it was pointed out@xcite , however , that the major mechanism of energy deposition is through radiative ( @xmath8 ) processes , suggesting that it is sufficient to consider a minijet system in order to explore the chemical and thermal equilibration of the system .",
    "this is what we are doing here .",
    "we study the initial phase - space distribution of minijets assuming no correlation between momentum and space and another one with correlation , especially those given by cooper at al@xcite , which we will call cmn distribution , in section ii .",
    "we briefly describe the semi - classical boltzmann equations of motion and the monte - carlo simulations to solve the equations in section iii .",
    "we present the results of our numerical solutions and a summary in section iv .",
    "the hard gluons produced after a relativistic heavy ion collision have been studied extensively by many authors .",
    "its momentum distribution as well as the total number of partons can be calculated by the method of pqcd . to see the dominant effect at very early times after the onset of a relativistic heavy ion collision",
    ", we consider only minijet gluons .",
    "using the parton distribution of colliding nucleus @xmath9 , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the parton distribution of a free nucleon and @xmath12 the nuclear ratio function , the minijet distribution can be calculated by the @xmath13 minijet cross section per nucleon in a @xmath14 collision , @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes a factor to include the higher order diagrams , which we will set to @xmath17 throughout our study .",

    "the production of minijet gluons strongly depends on the transverse momentum cut @xmath6 .",
    "we use @xmath36 gev at rhic energy , which is marginal for the use of pqcd .",
    "note that we set the minimum transverse momentum to be equal to the saturation momentum , where the gluon distribution becomes semi - classical @xcite .",
    "the total numbers of minijets ( integrated over rapidity ) is about 4800 at rhic .",
    "these numbers are quite large since we set the momentum cutoff for the minijets at the lower limit of the range @xmath37 gev@xmath38 at rhic . the rapidity distribution is shown in fig . 1 of reference @xcite .    to obtain the phase space distribution of minijets",

    "we assume that the probability for having an elastic scattering of constituent partons is proportional to the nuclear density overlap of the colliding nuclei .",

    "as expected , the ratio for the evolution without collisions remains clearly different from unity , which means that there is no kinetic equilibration .",

    "the simulation includes small angle elastic scattering , for which we set the minimum momentum transfer to @xmath92 gev/@xmath2 .",
    "we also show the results of simulations with hard scattering only , @xmath93 gev/@xmath2 .",
    "even though the total number of partons in the system is almost same with 9700 , only the system with small angle scatterings reaches a kinetically isotropic state .    on the other hand",
    ", the ratio for the system of minijets of cmn distribution always remains away from unity .",
    "we can understand this result as follows : since the value of the spatial rapidity of a produced parton is close to its momentum rapidity , those partons which have positive longitudinal momentum , will be produced with positive longitudinal position , the right hand side of the collision plane , and the parton with negative longitudinal momentum will be born at a negative longitudinal position , on the left - hand side of the collision plane .",
    "this correlation thus makes possible only those collisions between the particles which are running in the same longitudinal direction but different transverse momentum .",
    "this phenomena reduces the number of collisions and the collision energy substantially , so that the evolution is essentially free streaming .",

    "the density equals to the valence quark density of a free nucleon at @xmath101 gev@xmath99 .",

    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the energy density of the sphere as a function of time , which is almost exponential decreasement .",
    "the energy density decreases from 54 gev/@xmath95 at @xmath98 gev@xmath99 to 12 gev/@xmath95 at @xmath100 gev@xmath99 for our minijet simulations .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows the energy per parton in the sphere as a function of time .",
    "the energy per parton of free streaming(no collision ) is much higher at early stage of expansion than those of interacting systems , which means the parton loses a substantial amount of energy via scattering .",
    "the energy decreases from 1.7 gev at @xmath98 gev@xmath99 to 1.1 gev at @xmath100 gev@xmath99 for a minijet system .",
    "if we assume from fig [ fig4 ] that the local system of the sphere at the center is thermalized , the relativistic gas has the temperature @xmath102 mev at @xmath98 gev@xmath99 to 367 mev at @xmath100 gev@xmath99 for a minijet system and a mixed system , respectively .",
    "this system is much hotter than the qgp transition temperature @xmath103 mev .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] shows the total number of particles in the system .",
    "the secondary particles are produced within 2 fm/@xmath2 after the first contact of two colliding nuclei .",
    "this shows that the chemical freeze - out comes much earlier than the thermal freeze - out even at the center of collision .",
    "the total number of particles is about 9700 for a minijet system and 5200 for a minijet system of cmn distribution .",
    "as many authors have pointed out , the @xmath0 process , even though the process has the kinematical constraint , @xmath104 , which is @xmath105 gev in our simulations , plays a dominant role in depositing energy and thermalization of a system .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows the pseudo rapidity distribution of all of partons in the system at @xmath106 gev@xmath99 .",
    "since partonic collisions are ceased by this time , the distribution will be preserved to the final state unless the hadronic interaction changes them .",
    "we can see that the rapidity distribution is narrowed since the high rapidity partons at early time , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , have been scattered to produce the low rapidity partons .",
    "we also point out that the rapidity distribution is different from the final state ( hadronic ) rapidity distribution in number and the width@xcite .",
    "we conclude that the system is thermalized even with minijets at rhic energy if the small angle scatterings are included .",
    "when we look at the small sphere of radius @xmath88 fm at center , the system is thermalized from @xmath1 fm/@xmath2 till about 3.4 fm/@xmath2 . and",
    "the temperature is decreasing from 566 to 367 mev and the particle density from 32 to 11 @xmath97 . even after this time , the system is still hot untill about 8 fm/@xmath2 at the center and may cool down further after hadronization .",
    "the evolution of the system , which has no correlation between position and momentum , is very similar in character to the `` bottom - up thermalization '' scenario of baier _ et al._@xcite , in which the hard gluons liberated from the colliding nuclei within @xmath107 collide among themselves to produce soft gluons and thermalize via small angle scattering .",
