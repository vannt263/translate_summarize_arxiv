    "relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics has become a succesful tool to describe several stages of relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( hics ) @xcite .",

    "and , where it was shown that the hydrodynamic description of a conformal field does not belong to the conventional ( or entropy - wise ) israel - stewart @xcite formalism .",
    "in this paper we present a quadratic divergence - type theory ( dtt ) for a conformal field in flat space - time @xcite .",
    "the dtt goes beyond second order theories based on conformal invariants , since it resums all - order veloctiy gradients , but is limited to the case where the second - order coefficients involving vorticity vanish .",
    "we compare numerical results for the dtt to those for the second - order theory , for bjorken flow .",
    "the dtt approaches the ideal fluid behaviour faster than the second - order theory , thus being a suitable tool to describe early - time dynamics and shock - waves in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "dtts are interesting alternatives to the is formalism , because they are more general and flexible @xcite .",
    "a dtt is fully characterized once the generating function @xmath0 and the source tensor @xmath1 are given as ultra - local functions of the enlarged set of variables @xmath2 .",
    "here , @xmath3 is the inverse temperature vector , with @xmath4 being the velocity vector , and @xmath5 is a symmetric and traceless tensor characterizing departures from equilibrium ( it vanishes in equilibrium ) . introducing the symbol @xmath6 to denote the set @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the flux tensor , and @xmath9 the set @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the source tensor , the dtt is summed up in the equations @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the entropy current and @xmath14 is the thermodynamic potential .    for a conformal theory",
    ", @xmath15 is traceless and @xmath16 under a weyl transformation @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a function of space - time coordinates @xmath19 .",
    "these two requirements allow us to find the most general generating function which is quadratic in @xmath20 , and to calculate @xcite @xmath15 and @xmath8 .",
    "the linear part ( in @xmath20 ) of the source tensor is calculated requiring the dtt to reduce to eckart s theory at first order in velocity gradients .",
    "the quadratic part is calculated requiring that the second law hold exactly ( for arbitrary departures from equilibrium ) .",

    "bjorken flow is a successful toy model of heavy - ion collisions in the mid - rapidity region , capturing the most important features of the hydrodynamical evolution . in milne coordinates ( proper time and rapidity ) @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the velocity is constant @xmath24 , but the dynamics is non - trivial due to the fact that several christoffel symbols are nonzero .",
