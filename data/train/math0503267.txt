    "in recent years , the problem of finding index formulas for elliptic pseudodifferential operators on singular manifolds has been studied in numerous papers ( e.g. , see plamenevsky - rozenblum  @xcite , melrose - nistor  @xcite , rozenblum  @xcite , schulze - sternin - shatalov  @xcite , nazaikinskii - sternin  @xcite ) . despite considerable progress in this direction ,",
    "the situation is far from being clear yet .",
    "indeed , some of the formulas known in the literature fail to express the index via the principal symbol treated as an element of an appropriate calkin algebra ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , in other formulas , separate terms are not homotopy invariant ( e.g. , see fedosov - schulze - tarkhanov  @xcite ) , and the few formulas that combine both desirable properties ( e.g. , see  @xcite ) are valid only for an important but rather narrow class of operators satisfying certain symmetry conditions .",
    "this situation is primarily caused by the complicated symbol structure for pseudodifferential operators on singular manifolds .",
    "these symbols consist of components ( in general , operator - valued ) corresponding to the strata of the manifold and satisfying certain matching conditions for the adjacent strata see , e.g. schulze  @xcite . in a number of existing results ,",
    "the index of the operator is expressed as a sum of contributions from these symbol components .",
    "these contributions are usually noninteger and lack homotopy invariance , which is not at all surprising in the presence of the matching conditions .",
    "it is also difficult to assign to them any straightforward topological or algebraic meaning .",
    "one can ensure their homotopy invariance only by severely restricting the class of operators to be considered ( say , by imposing some symmetry conditions ) .",
    "a detailed analysis of symmetry conditions and their role in obtaining invariant index formulas can be found in savin - schulze - sternin  @xcite and in @xcite , and we do not dwell on the topic here .    in the present paper ,",
    "we propose another approach to the construction of index formulas on manifolds with singularities .",
    "this approach is based on @xmath0-theory of algebras and cyclic cohomology .",
    "we take a slightly different viewpoint as to what a `` good '' index formula must be . instead of trying to use topological invariants of separate components of the symbol ( which is hopeless due to results of  @xcite )",
    ", we consider the symbol as a whole , that is , as an element of an appropriate symbol algebra @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , instead of topological objects , one naturally deals with algebraic objects like the chern ",
    "connes character viewed as an element of the cyclic cohomology group of the symbol algebra . in the abstract framework , the scheme is well known .",
    "if the algebra @xmath2 is separable , then every quantization of @xmath2 ( in particular , the pseudodifferential quantization , which is of interest to us ) is equivalent ( e.g. ,  see blackadar  @xcite ) . ] to some ( generalized ) toeplitz quantization @xmath3 in the hilbert space @xmath4 defined as the range of an orthogonal projection @xmath5 in some hilbert @xmath2-module @xmath6 ; here @xmath5 is assumed to almost commute with the action of @xmath2 .    under the additional condition that the commutators of elements of the algebra with the projection are not only compact but also belong to an appropriate von neumann ",
    "schatten class , the toeplitz representation permits one to write out analytic index formulas ( see connes  @xcite ) .",
    "namely , if @xmath7 is a dense local subalgebra of @xmath2 such that the restriction of the toeplitz quantization to @xmath8 is @xmath9-summable,$ ] belongs to the @xmath9th von neumann  schatten class @xmath10 for every @xmath11 . ]",
    "then for an arbitrary elliptic element @xmath12 one has the index formula @xmath13\\otimes\\operatorname{tr}\\bigr )   \\bigl(\\underbrace{\\mathfrak{a}^{-1},\\mathfrak{a},\\mathfrak{a}^{-1 } ,   \\mathfrak{a } ,   \\ldots,\\mathfrak{a}^{-1 } ,   \\mathfrak{a}}_{\\text{$n+1 $ arguments}}\\bigr),\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is odd , @xmath15 is the matrix trace , and the _ chern  connes character _ @xmath16 $ ] of the quantization @xmath17 is given by the formula @xmath18(a_0,a_1,\\ldots , a_n)\\\\=\\sqrt{2i }   ( -1)^{n(n-1)/2}\\gamma{\\biggl}(\\frac n2 + 1{\\biggr})^{-1}\\operatorname{tr}\\{a_0[p , a_1][p , a_2]\\dotsm [ p , a_n]\\}.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] ( here @xmath19 is the operator trace in @xmath6 . )    to apply this formalism to manifolds with singularities , we do the following .",
    "for the case of a smooth compact closed manifold @xmath20 , there is a well - known toeplitz quantization @xmath21 of the symbol algebra @xmath22 with the help of the szeg - caldern projection @xmath23 in the space @xmath24 of square integrable functions on the cosphere bundle @xmath25 , see guillemin ,  @xcite , boutet de monvel  @xcite , boutet de monvel - guillemin  @xcite .",
    "this construction was explained in  @xcite as showing that pseudodifferential operators are toeplitz operators in disguise . in the present paper",
    ", we generalize this quantization and construct a toeplitz quantization equivalent to the standard pseudodifferential quantization for manifolds with conical singularities .",
    "thus pseudodifferential operators on a manifold with conical singularities are toeplitz operators in disguise , too .",
    "( this toeplitz quantization acts in a more complicated space , which , however , turns into @xmath24 if there are no singularities . ) in the smooth case , the equivalence ( and even the almost isomorphism ) of the toeplitz quantization to the pseudodifferential quantization as a homogeneous function of degree zero in the fibers is assumed . ]",
    "@xmath26 is given by the so - called guillemin transform @xmath27 ( see the cited papers ) , and we construct an analog of this transform for manifolds with singularities , thus proving the equivalence ( and even an almost isomorphism ) of quantizations in this case .",
    "this naturally results in an index formula of the form   for elliptic operators on manifolds with conical singularities .",
    "this algebraic index formula has several advantages :    * first , it expresses the index via the principal symbol alone and is homotopy invariant ; * second , it is valid for arbitrary elliptic symbols , not just for symbols satisfying some symmetry conditions ; * third , most importantly , it is expressed in terms of the cyclic cohomology class @xmath16 $ ] of the algebra @xmath8 .",
    "it is the cyclic cohomology of the symbol algebra that replaces the homology of a manifold as one passes from the algebra of functions on a smooth manifold to more general symbol algebras .    a serious disadvantage of this formula ( and in general of the index formula   for toeplitz quantizations given by projections of general form )",
    "is that it fails to be local . at the same time , if the chosen projection is the positive spectral projection of an unbounded local operator , then a different representation of the index cocycle   is possible , which results in more traditional , local index formulas .",
    "( see connes - moscovici  @xcite . ) in this connection , the construction of a local index formula involves the natural problem of finding an unbounded local operator such that the toeplitz quantization generated by its positive spectral projection is equivalent to the pseudodifferential quantization on a manifold with conical singularities .    in the smooth case ,",
    "the desired operator is the dirac operator . more precisely , the natural self - adjoint dirac operator @xmath28 acting on sections of the spinor bundle on the odd - dimensional contact manifold @xmath25 is associated with the almost complex structure on the distribution of contact hyperplanes",
    ". then the index of a pseudodifferential operator @xmath29 proves to be equal to the index of the toeplitz operator constructed from the symbol  @xmath30 and the positive spectral projection of the dirac operator  ( see baum - douglas  @xcite ) : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the natural projection .",
    "this equality of indices shows that ( at least , modulo torsion elements in the group @xmath33 ) the quantization given by the positive spectral projection @xmath34 of the dirac operator is equivalent to the pseudodifferential quantization and hence to the quantization with the help of the szeg ",
    "caldern projection .",
    "there are @xmath0-theoretic proofs of this fact .",
    "( one of then is based on the atiyah ",
    "singer theorem , e.g. , see kaminker  @xcite , and another , by baum - douglas - taylor  @xcite , uses some facts concerning the @xmath35-neumann problem . )",
    "both these approaches to the proof of   encounter serious difficulties in the case of manifolds with singularities .",
    "the main difficulty is that so far one does not have even a hypothetical candidate for the `` dirac operator '' ( i.e. , an operator for which   holds ) for the case of manifolds with conical singularities .",
    "a prototype for a possible generalization of formula   to the conical case is the proof of   ( as a special case of more general index formulas for toeplitz operators and quantized contact transformations on general contact manifolds ) due to epstein , melrose , and mendoza ( see  @xcite and also  @xcite ) .",
    "their proof _ relates the szeg ",
    "caldern projection and the positive spectral projection of the dirac operator by a finite chain of transformations _ and hence is of interest to us as a model for the possible definition of the dirac operator in the conical case .",
    "indeed , we have already constructed a counterpart of the szeg ",
    "caldern projection for manifolds with conical singularities and proved the equivalence of the toeplitz quantization and the pseudodifferential quantization .",
    "the epstein  melrose ",
    "mendoza construction comprises three steps ( we give more detail in the appendix ) :    1 .   constructing a resolution of the szeg ",
    "caldern projection ( in the case of the cosphere bundle of a smooth manifold , the resolution is given by the kohn ",
    "rossi complex , e.g. , see folland - kohn  @xcite ) ; 2 .   proving that the toeplitz quantization associated with the positive spectral projection of the operator @xmath36 obtained as the standard roll - up of this resolution produces the operator with the same index as the toeplitz quantization associated with the szeg  caldern projection ; 3 .   deforming the self - adjoint operator @xmath36 to the dirac operator @xmath28 .    in the present paper",
    ", we show that step  2 of this construction is a special case of a general assertion that permits one , starting from a toeplitz quantization of an arbitrary @xmath1-algebra @xmath2 , to obtain new equivalent ( i.e. , defining the same class in @xmath33 ) toeplitz quantizations associated with positive spectral projections of self - adjoint operators .",
    "the construction goes as follows : for a projection @xmath5 almost commuting with the action of @xmath2 , one takes a finite - length resolution in hilbert @xmath2-modules . rolling up the resolution in the standard way and adding the projection itself and the projection onto the cokernel in the last term of the resolution , one obtains a self - adjoint operator in the direct sum of all hilbert modules occurring in the resolution .",
    "the positive spectral projection of this self - adjoint operator is the desired new projection .    in conclusion",
    ", we note that the so far open problem of defining the dirac operator @xmath28 in the conical case is undoubtedly of interest in that such an operator is a `` fundamental cycle '' of the algebra @xmath2 ( the noncommutative manifold ) and , in particular , defines the poincar duality on it : @xmath37 in the smooth case ( @xmath38 ) , this is reduced to the isomorphism @xmath39    the paper is organized as follows . in the first section ,",
    "we construct a toeplitz representation of the pseudodifferential quantization on manifolds with conical singularities .",
    "section  2 contains the above - mentioned construction of equivalent quantizations from resolutions of projections .",
    "first we consider the case in which the resolution is formed by bounded operators and then the case in which the resolution is formed by unbounded operators . in the appendix , we briefly describe the construction of  @xcite for the special case in which the contact manifold in question is the cosphere bundle of a smooth compact manifold without boundary .    throughout the paper , we assume that the reader is acquainted with the notions and definitions of @xmath0-theory of operator algebras and related topics ( e.g. , see  @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the necessary definitions and facts of the theory of ( pseudo)differential operators on manifolds with conical singularities are given in subsection  1.1 together with appropriate bibliographic references .",
    "we consider pseudodifferential operators on a compact manifold @xmath20 with isolated conical singularities .",
    "we always assume that there is only one conical point @xmath41 ; extending the results to the general case encounters no difficulties . in this subsection",
    "we briefly list main definitions and facts .",
    "details can be found , e.g. , in schulze  @xcite , egorov - schulze  @xcite , schulze - sternin - shatalov  @xcite and , as it concerns the cylindrical representation for cone - degenerate pseudodifferential operators , also in nazaikinskii - sternin  @xcite .",

    "* chap .  9 ) ) , it is always true that @xmath455 for a self - adjoint operator @xmath365 , since the function @xmath456 vanishes at zero , is positive for positive @xmath457 , and is negative for negative @xmath457 .",
    "this proves the lemma .",
    "now the preceding results actually prove the theorem , since we have @xmath458=[p_+(\\wt d)]$ ] by lemma  [ lemmaa ] and theorem  [ 34 ] , and it remains to apply the result   of lemma  [ lemmab ] .",
    "the proof of the theorem is complete .",
    "we note possible generalizations of the results obtained .",
    "first , there is no need , in fact , to assume that the sequence   is exact in all intermediate terms ; it suffices to require that is has finite - dimensional cohomology in these terms . then the corresponding finite rank projections define trivial quantizations and hence the assertion of the main theorem remains valid .",
    "second , if we replace the condition that the resolvents of @xmath363 be compact by the condition that they belong to some von neumann ",
    "schatten classes , then in the end we obtain , for some @xmath9 , an unbounded @xmath9-summable fredholm module determined by the operator @xmath258 .",
    "in this appendix , we describe the constructions of  @xcite in slightly more detail , restricting ourselves to the case in which the contact manifold @xmath459 considered there is the cosphere bundle of a smooth closed compact manifold @xmath20 .",
    "grauert  @xcite showed that the cosphere bundle @xmath460 can always be represented as the boundary of a pseudoconvex stein manifold diffeomorphic to the ball bundle @xmath461 ( the grauert tube ) .",
    "then the szeg ",
    "caldern projection @xmath462 can be defined as the projection in @xmath463 onto the subspace of boundary values of holomorphic functions in the grauert tube .",
    "the manifold @xmath464 bears the natural kohn ",
    "rossi complex ( the boundary @xmath465-complex ; e.g. , see  @xcite ) @xmath466 where @xmath277 is the dimension of the manifold @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath467 is the bundle of @xmath468-forms associated with the natural complex structure on the contact hyperplane distribution .",
    "the complex   is acyclic in all dimensions except for @xmath73 and @xmath277 .",
    "moreover , its cohomology space in the zero term exactly coincides with the range of the szeg - caldern projection @xmath462 .",
    "note that if we `` roll up '' the complex   in a standard way ( i.e. , pass to the operator @xmath469 in the direct sum of all spaces of the complex . ] ) , then the resulting self - adjoint operator is closely related to the dirac operator on @xmath459 .",
    "this relationship can be conveniently represented in the block @xmath470 expansion of this operator corresponding to the expansion of the space @xmath471 into the sum of even and odd components : @xmath472 where @xmath473 is the covariant derivative along a direction transversal to the contact distribution ( more precisely , along the reeb vector field ) .",
    "this suggests that the kohn ",
    "rossi complex can be used to prove the equivalence of the quantizations given by the szeg ",
    "caldern projection @xmath462 and the positive spectral projection of the dirac operator .",
    "the construction carried out in  @xcite consists of two steps .",
    "\\1 ) let @xmath474 be the orthogonal projection on the cokernel of the last operator @xmath465 in the kohn ",
    "rossi complex . the operator @xmath475 ( where the projections @xmath462 and @xmath476 act in the first and the last component , respectively ) is self - adjoint and invertible . in accordance with the general results proved in  sec",
    ".  2 , the quantization with the help of the positive spectral projection of @xmath36 is equivalent to the quantization with the help of the szeg  caldern projection .",
    "( in  @xcite , only the equalities for the indices of operator obtained from the same symbol by these two quantizations were proved . )",
    "\\2 ) now it remains to deform the operator @xmath477 continuously in the class of fredholm operators to the dirac operator @xmath28 .",
    "this procedure is described in sufficient detail in the cited papers , and we only briefly mention the main points .",
    "first , the operator @xmath36 _ is not pseudodifferential _ ( owing to the presence of the projections @xmath462 and @xmath476 , which are not pseudodifferential operators ) .",
    "however , on contact manifolds there is a natural `` anisotropic '' version of pseudodifferential calculus , known as the heisenberg calculus .",
    "more precisely , in this calculus the differentiations along contact directions have the weight @xmath411 , and the differentiation along the transversal ( reeb ) direction has the weight  @xmath478 . since the contact distribution is nonintegrable , the product in the algebra of principal symbols proves to be noncommutative . the principal symbol over each point",
    "@xmath479 is a pair of equivariant operators in the standard irreducible representation of the heisenberg group in @xmath480 . in particular , the projections @xmath462 and @xmath476 turn out to be heisenberg pseudodifferential operators whose symbols are the projections on the vacuum vector of the harmonic oscillator in one component of the pair and are equal to zero in the other component .",
    "the paper  @xcite contains also an `` extended '' version of the heisenberg calculus , which includes heisenberg pseudodifferential operators as well as usual pseudodifferential operators .",
    "the homotopy of @xmath36 to the dirac operator @xmath28 is carried out in the framework of the extended calculus .",
