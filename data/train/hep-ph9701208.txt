    "<S> polarized heavy quarkonium productions in @xmath0 decays are considered . </S>",
    "<S> we find that polarizations of the produced quarkonia are independent of that of the parent @xmath0 provided that one considers the energy distribution or the total production rate . </S>",
    "<S> produced @xmath1 s via the color - octet and the color - singlet mechanisms are expected to be 19% and 29% longitudinally polarized , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the energy dependence of @xmath2 is very sensitive to the production mechanism , and therefore the measurement of @xmath3 will be an independent probe of the color - octet mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> since braaten and fleming put forward the idea of the color - octet mechanism @xcite as a possible solution to the so - called @xmath4 puzzle at the tevatron @xcite , there have been many activities applying this idea to other processes : heavy quarkonium ( both @xmath5 and @xmath6wave charmonium and bottomium ) productions at the tevatron @xcite , in @xmath7 decays @xcite , fixed target experiments@xcite , @xmath8 collisions @xcite , @xmath9 annihilations at cleo @xcite , and @xmath0 decays at lep @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> polarized heavy quarkonium productions were also considered as an independent check of the color - octet mechanism @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is adopted in the calculations of the @xmath4 polarizations at the tevatron @xcite . a new way to regularize the ultraviolet / infrared divergences in heavy quarkonium calculations </S>",
    "<S> was proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also , some nrqcd matrix elements relevant to @xmath10- and @xmath11-wave heavy quarkonium decays were calculated on the lattice @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> some reviews of earlier literatures can be found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in the color - singlet model </S>",
    "<S> , the prompt @xmath1 production rate in @xmath0 decays is dominated by charm quark fragmentation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , recent reports by opal collaboration @xcite claim that they have observed an excess of events for @xmath12(for @xmath13 ) , larger than the theoretical expectation by a factor of @xmath14 , compared to the @xmath15quark fragmentation contribution@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar excess was also observed in the prompt @xmath1 and @xmath4 production in @xmath0 decays , although the experimental errors are quite large @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the color - octet gluon fragmentation suggested by braaten and fleming could fix this discrepancy through @xmath16 followed by color - octet gluon fragmentation into @xmath1 with emission of soft gluons @xcite . in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the energy distribution of the produced @xmath1 via the color - octet @xmath17 intermediate state was shown to be dramatically different from that of the @xmath1 produced via the color singlet mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the @xmath1 energy distribution in the @xmath0 decays could be another good test of the idea of the color - octet mechanism . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the present authors have considered the angular distribution of @xmath1 s in @xmath0 decays , and one can find whether the color - octet mechanism is working or not .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we suggest another observable , the polarization of @xmath1 at lep produced via the color - singlet and the color - octet mechanisms . in short , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 s produced via the two channels , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , have distinctively different polarizations . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 produced by the color - octet mechanism is about @xmath20 longitudinally polarized , whereas @xmath1 by the color - singlet mechanism is about @xmath21 longitudinally polarized .    </S>",
    "<S> when treating polarized quarkonium productions , one should take care of the soft process @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> recently , braaten and chen developed a method for treating the polarized heavy quarkonium production@xcite which we use here . </S>",
    "<S> beneke and rothstein also pointed out that the interference among different @xmath23 states occurs in a polarized heavy quarkonium production  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in general , one expresses the free particle amplitude , where @xmath24 makes a transition into the physical quarkonium state , in a power series of the relative momentum @xmath25 of @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the @xmath24 rest frame . </S>",
    "<S> then , one can find out what specific spectroscopic state of the @xmath24 pair is initially produced in the hard process amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> finally , one may consider the soft transition in which the initially produced @xmath24 system transforms into the physical heavy quarkonium state in which one is interested . in the case of heavy quarkonium production by the color - singlet mechanism , </S>",
    "<S> the soft process does not change any spectroscopic quantum numbers such as color and angular momentum up to @xmath28 order correction ( which contains relativistic correction and double @xmath29 transitions ) : @xmath30 in @xmath0 decay , the color - singlet production process mainly comes from the feynman diagram shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figone ] , whereas the color - octet production process mainly comes from the soft process @xmath31 as shown in fig .  [ figtwo ] . </S>",
    "<S> if we consider @xmath1 polarization , we should take into account the relation of the @xmath1 polarization and the angular momentum of the initial @xmath24 pair . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath1 is produced via the color - singlet mechanism @xmath32 the polarization vector of @xmath1 is identical to spin wavefunction of the initially produced @xmath24 pair . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization vector of the @xmath33 produced via the color - octet mechanism through double e1 transitions , @xmath34 is the same as the spin polarization vector of the initially produced @xmath35 , since the e1 transition conserves spin and the total angular momenta of the @xmath35 and @xmath1 are the same </S>",
    "<S> . therefore , in these two channels , there is no problem , even though we treat the polarization vector of the produced @xmath1 and the spin wavefunction of the @xmath24 pair to be the same . </S>",
    "<S> the only factor involving the polarization of the produced @xmath1 is the hard process shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figone ] and [ figtwo ] which produce a @xmath24 pair at short distance . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath36 produced via the color - octet mechanism comes from the gluon propagator , it seems to be strongly transversely polarized . </S>",
    "<S> the quantitative number for the color - octet produced @xmath1 polarization can be obtained only after the full calculations , which will be presented below along with the numerical results .    before presenting the results for the @xmath1 polarization at lep </S>",
    "<S> , we first argue that the @xmath0 polarization at lep does not affect the @xmath1 polarization in @xmath0 decays . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 produced at lep is polarized as a result of unequal vector and axial vector couplings between electron and @xmath0 boson . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the density matrix @xmath37 of @xmath0 is given by @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 is 4-momentum of @xmath0 . @xmath41 and @xmath42 are vector and tensor polarization of a @xmath0 boson : @xmath43 where @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 being four - momenta of @xmath47 and @xmath48 at lep , and @xmath49 are the vector and the axial vector couplings between @xmath50 and @xmath0 boson . </S>",
    "<S> we can write the decay rate of @xmath0 as @xmath51 \\int d_2(ps ) h_{\\mu\\nu},\\ ] ] where @xmath52 \\equiv \\frac{d^3 p}{(2 \\pi)^3 2 p^0}$ ] is the invariant phase space of the produced heavy quarkonium with four - momentum @xmath53 . by the lorentz covariance , </S>",
    "<S> the integration @xmath54 gives terms proportional to @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> here , @xmath56 is the only non - vanishing term after being contracted with the vector polarization term in @xmath37 , and the result is proportional to @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the angle between the initial electron - beam and the produced quarkonium directions . </S>",
    "<S> when they are contracted with the tensor polarization contribution in @xmath37 , only @xmath59 gives a nonzero quantity , proportional to @xmath60 . in calculating the energy distribution or the total decay rate , we integrate over the angle @xmath58 by which all of the contributions from the polarization dependence vanish . </S>",
    "<S> therefore @xmath37 can be safely replaced by @xmath61 in our calculations , effectively .    </S>",
    "<S> when one considers the @xmath1 polarization , it is convenient to define @xmath62 to be the ratio of the production rate ( @xmath63 ) of the longitudinal @xmath1 to the total production rate ( @xmath64 ) as follows : @xmath65 this ratio @xmath62 can be determined experimentally from the measurement of the angular distribution of the leptons in the subsequent decay @xmath66 @xcite . defining @xmath67 to be the angle between the three momentum of @xmath1 in the @xmath0 rest frame and the three momentum of the daughter lepton ( say @xmath68 ) in the rest frame of @xmath1 , the angular distribution of a lepton in the decaying @xmath1 rest frame has the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 the unpolarized @xmath1 corresponds to @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .    </S>",
    "<S> the polarized @xmath1 production in @xmath0 decays in the color - singlet model was calculated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite using the fragmentation approximation . in that paper </S>",
    "<S> , the authors showed that the asymmetry @xmath73 is rather small , i.e. @xmath74 5% . </S>",
    "<S> also , @xmath73 is independent of the produced quarkonium mass so that @xmath73 s are the same both for @xmath1 and @xmath75 production in their fragmentation approach @xcite .    in our work , we calculated all the feynman diagrams without any fragmentation approximation in the color - singlet and color - octet contribution . </S>",
    "<S> we recover their results in the limit of @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> our results shown in the appendix depend explicitly on the parameter @xmath77 , and numerical values are shown in table i. note that @xmath73 s are considerably different for @xmath78 and @xmath79 . also , the fragmentation approximation is not that accurate at calculating the @xmath75 polarization in the @xmath0 decays because of a rather large mass of @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath73 s are enhanced compared to those calculated in the fragmentation approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> when we compare the polarization of @xmath1 produced via the color - singlet and the color - octet mechanisms , we observe that there is a considerable difference between @xmath80 for the singlet and @xmath81 for the octet @xmath82 contribution to @xmath1 production . adding the singlet and the octet contributions , we get @xmath83 , which is appreciably different from @xmath84 or @xmath85 . these numerical values are consistent with those mentioned in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have used the following numerical values for the matrix elements of nrqcd appearing in the @xmath1 production rates from the @xmath0 decays : @xmath86 we remark that both @xmath87 and @xmath88 are independent of these nrqcd matrix elements , since they cancel in the numerator and the denominator when we take the ratio in @xmath62 . on the other hand , @xmath89 does depend on the numerical values of nrqcd matrix elements in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 11)-(12 ) , each of which is known only within a factor of @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the definite test of the color - octet mechanism in @xmath91 will be a deviation of the measured @xmath92 from the singlet prediction , @xmath87 or @xmath88 , in the direction of a larger value of @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> deviation of the @xmath1 polarizations ( or @xmath73 ) from the color - singlet prediction ( @xmath84 ) may be used as a probe to check the color octet mechanism in heavy quarkonium productions , once a few thousand decays of @xmath66 are observed in @xmath0 decays . in the case of @xmath93 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath94 is not so sensitive to the singlet / octet mechanisms : @xmath95 and @xmath96 , which are considerably larger than the prediction @xmath97 based on the fragmentation approach .    the energy dependence of @xmath98 ( with @xmath99 ) differs greatly depending on the @xmath1 production mechanisms , as we can see in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figthree ] for the case of @xmath1 and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figfour ] for the case of @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 s produced via the color - singlet mechanism are almost unpolarized in almost the entire energy range , while the @xmath1 s produced via the color - octet mechanism are highly transversal ( especially at high energy ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore if we observe quarkonium of a particular energy range , we can greatly increase the polarization sensitivity if there are enough data . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if we observe the @xmath1 only in the range of @xmath100 , where most of color - singlet @xmath1 is produced  @xcite , @xmath101 and @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> these values correspond to @xmath103 and @xmath104 . in the same energy range , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath105 and @xmath106 for the case of @xmath75 , which correspond to @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we can also observe @xmath75 s in the energy range @xmath109 , where most of color - octet @xmath75 s are produced  @xcite . in this energy range , </S>",
    "<S> color - singlet @xmath75 is more transversal than color - octet @xmath75 , where @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , corresponding to @xmath112 and @xmath113 respectively .    in conclusion , we have calculated polarization in heavy quarkonium ( @xmath1 and @xmath75 ) productions in @xmath0 decay . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization of @xmath1 s produced via the color octet mechanism is more transversal compared to those produced via the color singlet mechanism ( table  i ) . </S>",
