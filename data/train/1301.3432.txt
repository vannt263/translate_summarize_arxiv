    "imaging and manipulating matter at sub - micron length scales has been the cornerstone of nano - sciences development @xcite . in soft matter systems , including those of biological relevance , the cohesive energies being only barely larger than the thermal energy @xmath0 , forces as small as a pico - newton exerted over a nanometer length scale might be significant enough to induce structural changes .",
    "examples can be found in the stretching of dna molecules by optical traps @xcite , on the behavior of colloidal solutions under external fields @xcite and on the deformations of self - assembled bilayers @xcite to name just a few .",
    "thus , in soft matter , when one exerts a localized force over a small area , precise control of the acting force requires not only a prescribed value of the total applied force but , more importantly , a precise pressure distribution in the contact area .    the microscopic nature of pressure has been understood since the seminal work of bernoulli two and a half centuries ago : in a container , momentum is transferred by collisions from the moving particles to the walls @xcite .",
    "when the particle concentration is homogeneous so is the pressure .",
    "strategies for localizing the pressure over a nanometer area thus requires the generation of strong concentration inhomogeneities , at equivalently small scales .",
    "_ @xcite and breidnich _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite have recently realized that such inhomogeneities are intrinsic to entropic systems of connected particles such as polymer chains , and have computed the inhomogeneous pressure associated with end - grafted polymer chains within available analytical theories for ideal chains .",
    "their results show that the polymer produces a local field of pressure on the grafting surface , with the interaction being strong at the anchoring point and vanishing far enough from it .",
    "scaling arguments were also put forward in @xcite to discuss the more relevant case of real polymer chains , where excluded volume interactions between the different monomers need to be taken into account .",
    "these arguments suggest that the functional variation of pressure with distance from the grafting point should be the same in chains with or without excluded volume interactions , albeit with different prefactors .    in this paper",
    "we compute the inhomogenous pressure applied to a wall by an end - grafted polymer with excluded volume interactions , modeled by selfavoiding walks ( saws ) on the square lattice . in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] we illustrate our model with a wall located at @xmath1 .",
    "the wall is neutral , in the sense that the statistical weight of a monomer placed on the wall is equal to the weight of a monomer in the bulk .",
    "the length of a step of the walk is equal to the lattice constant @xmath2 , and we use this as the length unit .",
    "the model is athermal , that is , all allowed configurations of a saw have the same energy .",
    "a saw grafted at the origin @xmath3 to a wall placed on the @xmath4 axis . if the vertex on the wall at @xmath5 is not excluded , the only possibility for the next step would be towards this vertex .",
    "if this vertex is excluded , the saw will end at the final point @xmath6.,width=302 ]    the canonical partition function of walks with @xmath7 steps ( @xmath8 ) is equal to the number of saws starting at the origin and restricted to the half - plane @xmath9 , called @xmath10 in @xcite .",
    "the helmholtz free energy is given by @xmath11 .",
    "we can estimate the pressure exerted by the saw at a point @xmath12 on the wall by excluding this vertex from the lattice .",
    "the excluded vertex is represented as a hatched square in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] at @xmath13 .",
    "the pressure @xmath14 exerted at this point is then related to the change in the free energy when the vertex is excluded , @xmath15 .",
    "if we call @xmath16 the number of @xmath7 step saws with the vertex at @xmath12 excluded , the dimensionless reduced pressure may be written as @xmath17 of course we are interested in the thermodynamic limit @xmath18 , so the enumeration data must be extrapolated to the infinite length limit .",
    "it is worth noting that the density of monomers at the vertex @xmath12 is given by @xmath19 , so that @xmath20 .",
    "\\label{pdens}\\ ] ]    the exact enumerations allow us to obtain precise estimates of the pressure exerted by saw s at small distances of the grafting point , and we find , rather surprisingly , that the asymptotic form of this pressure is well reproduced even for these small values of @xmath21 . in section [ sec : enum ] we give some details of the computational enumeration procedure . in section [ sec : res ] the enumeration data are analyzed and estimates for the pressure as a function of the distance to the grafting point are presented .",
    "final discussions and conclusions may be found in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the algorithm we use to enumerate saws on the square lattice builds on the pioneering work of enting @xcite who enumerated square lattice self - avoiding polygons using the finite lattice method .",
    "more specifically our algorithm is based in large part on the one devised by conway , enting and guttmann @xcite for the enumeration of saws .",
    "the details of our algorithm can be found in @xcite .",
    "below we shall only briefly outline the basics of the algorithm and describe the changes made for the particular problem studied in this work .    the first terms in the series for the saws generating function can be calculated using transfer matrix techniques to count the number of saws in rectangles @xmath22 vertices wide and @xmath23 vertices long .",
    "any saw spanning such a rectangle has length at least @xmath24 . by adding the contributions from all rectangles of width @xmath25 and length @xmath26 the number of saw",
    "is obtained correctly up to length @xmath27 .",
    "the generating function for rectangles with fixed width @xmath22 are calculated using transfer matrix ( tm ) techniques .",
    "the most efficient implementation of the tm algorithm generally involves bisecting the finite lattice with a boundary ( this is just a line in the case of rectangles ) and moving the boundary in such a way as to build up the lattice vertex by vertex as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : transfer ] .",
    "if we draw a saw and then cut it by a line we observe that the partial saw to the left of this line consists of a number of loops connecting two edges ( we shall refer to these as loop ends ) in the intersection , and pieces which are connected to only one edge ( we call these free ends ) .",
    "the other end of the free piece is either the start - point or the end - point of the saw so there are at most two free ends .",
    "each end of a loop is assigned one of two labels depending on whether it is the lower end or the upper end of a loop .",
    "each configuration along the boundary line can thus be represented by a set of edge states @xmath28 , where    @xmath29    if we read from the bottom to the top , the configuration or signature @xmath30 along the intersection of the partial saw in fig .",
    "[ fig : transfer ] is @xmath31 .",
    "since crossings are nt permitted this encoding uniquely describes which loop ends are connected .     a snapshot of the boundary line ( dashed line ) during the transfer matrix ( tm ) calculation on a strip of width 7 with @xmath32 .",
    "the filled circle indicates the grafted start - point of the saw and the shaded box the excluded vertex .",
    "saws are enumerated by successive moves of the kink in the boundary line , as exemplified by the position given by the dotted line , so that one vertex and two edges at a time are added to the strip . to the left of the boundary line",
    "we have drawn an example of a partially completed saw . ]",
    "the sum over all contributing graphs is calculated as the boundary is moved through the lattice . for each configuration of occupied or empty edges along the intersection",
    "we maintain a generating function @xmath33 for partial walks with signature @xmath30 .",
    "in exact enumeration studies such as this @xmath33 is a truncated polynomial @xmath34 where @xmath35 is conjugate to the number of steps . in a tm",
    "update each source signature @xmath30 ( before the boundary is moved ) gives rise to a few new target signatures @xmath36 ( after the move of the boundary line ) and @xmath37 or 2 new edges are inserted leading to the update @xmath38 . once a signature @xmath30 has been processed it can be discarded .",
    "the calculations were done using integer arithmetic modulo several prime numbers with the full integer coefficients reconstructed at the end using the chinese remainder theorem .    some changes to the algorithm described in @xcite",
    "are required in order to enumerate the restricted saw we study here .",
    "grafting the saw to the wall can be achieved by forcing the saw to have a free end ( the start - point ) on the top side of the rectangle . in enumerations of unrestricted saw one can use symmetry to restrict the tm calculations to rectangles with @xmath39 and @xmath40 by counting contributions for rectangles with @xmath41 twice .",
    "the grafting of the start - point to the wall breaks the symmetry and we have to consider all rectangles with @xmath42 . clearly the number of configurations one must consider grows with @xmath22 .",
    "hence one wants to minimize the length of the boundary line . to achieve this the tm calculation on the set of rectangles",
    "is broken into two sub - sets with @xmath40 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the calculations for the sub - set with @xmath40 is done as outlined above . in the calculations for the sub - set with @xmath43 the boundary line",
    "is chosen to be horizontal ( rather than vertical ) so it cuts across at most @xmath44 edges .",
    "alternatively , one may view the calculation for the second sub - set as a tm algorithm for saw with its start - point on the left - most border of the rectangle .",
    "exclusion of the vertex at distance @xmath21 from the starting point of the saw is achieved by blocking this vertex so the walk ca nt visit the vertex .",
    "the actual calculation can be done in at least two ways .",
    "one can simply specify the position of the starting point ( and @xmath21 ) on the upper / left border and sum over all possible positions .",
    "this means doing calculations for a given width @xmath22 many times ; once for each position of the starting point of the saw .",
    "alternatively one can introduce ` memory ' into the tm algorithm . specifically once we have created a configuration which inserts the first free end we ` remember ' that it did so .",
    "we can flag that the free end has been inserted by adding a ghost edge to the configuration initially in state 0 . once the first free end is inserted the state of the ghost edge",
    "is changed to @xmath45 . in the next sweep the state of the ghost edge",
    "is incremented by 1 .",
    "when the state of the ghost edge has reached the value @xmath21 the vertex on the top border is blocked .",
    "the problem with the first approach is that we need to do many calculations for any given rectangle .",
    "the problem with the second approach is that we need to keep @xmath46 copies of most tm configurations thus using substantially more memory .",
    "the choice will be a matter of whether the major computational bottle - neck is cpu time or memory .",
    "for this study we used the first approach .    in more detail the tm algorithm for the case @xmath40 works as follows .",
    "a saw has two free ends and in the tm algorithm the first free end is forced to be at the top at a distance @xmath47 from from the left border ( this is the starting point of the saw ) .",
    "we then add a further @xmath48 columns ; in the next column the top vertex is forced to be empty .",
    "after this further columns are added up to a maximum length of @xmath49 .",
    "this calculation is then repeated for @xmath50 to @xmath51 thus enumerating all possible saws spanning rectangles of width exactly @xmath22 and length @xmath40 .",
    "a similar calculation is then done with the saw grafted to the left border and in each case repeated for all @xmath52 .",
    "the calculation above enumerates almost all possible saws .",
    "however , we have missed those saws with two free ends in the top border where the end - point precedes the starting - point . that is there is a free end in the top border at a distance @xmath53 prior to the excluded vertex .",
    "we need to count such saws separately .",
    "the required changes to the algorithm are quite straight - forward and will not be detailed here .",
    "we calculated the number of saws up to length @xmath54 for the unrestricted case and for an excluded vertex with @xmath55 , 20 . in each case",
    "the calculation was performed in parallel using up to 8 processors , a maximum of some 16 gb of memory and using a total of under 2000 cpu hours ( see @xcite for details of the parallel algorithm ) .",
    "we needed 3 primes to represent each series correctly and the calculations for all the primes were done in a single run .",
    "in tables [ tab : cn1 ] and [ tab : cn11 ] , we have listed the results for the enumerations of self - avoiding walks without additional restrictions , @xmath10 , and walks which are not allowed to occupy the vertex @xmath5 of the wall , @xmath56 .",
    "if we calculate the pressures directly , we notice a parity effect , as seen in the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : peuler ] .",
    "this effect is related to an unphysical singularity in the generating function of the counts @xmath10 , @xmath57 . besides the physical singularity at @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the connective constant",
    ", there is another singularity at @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "this point will be discussed in more detail below , and more precise estimates for the pressures at several distances from the grafting point will be provided .",
    "pressure @xmath61 for @xmath13 , calculated with the enumeration data for @xmath10 and @xmath56 using expression ( [ p]).,width=377 ]    .number of walks in the half - plane @xmath10 .",
    "[ tab : cn1 ] [ cols=\"^,<,^,<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      ( a ) the pressure @xmath62 exerted by a polymer on a surface at a distance @xmath21 from the grafting point .",
    "data are for polymers modelled as saws or gaussian chains . the dashed line are a @xmath63 fit .",
    "( b ) both data have the same @xmath63 scaling form , even for values close to @xmath64 .",
    "the dashed lines are guide lines with slope equal to @xmath65 . ]",
    "since our model is athermal and discrete , it is not really possible to compare our results with those obtained for the gaussian chain .",
    "however , as was already mentioned by bickel _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the excluded volume interactions should not change the scaling form of the pressure .",
    "[ fig : press](b ) clearly shows a @xmath63 decay of the pressure , even for small distances . according to bickel _",
    "@xcite , this similarity is due to the fact that the pressure and the monomer concentration in the vicinity of the wall are linearly related . on the other hand , it seems that the concentration is not affected by the molecular details or by the differences between chain models . in our case , despite the fact that @xmath66 and @xmath62 are related by a logarithmic relation , as shown in expression ( [ pdens ] ) , we have for @xmath67 a small concentration leading to a linear relation between those quantities . actually ,",
    "even for @xmath68 , we can observe a linear dependence , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prerho ] .      since the grafted chain is in mechanical equilibrium , the force @xmath70 applied to the walk at the grafting point , which is in the negative @xmath35 direction in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , should be equal to the sum of the forces applied by the wall at other contact points , which are in the positive @xmath35 direction .",
    "thus , the dimensionless force is given by : @xmath71 for gaussian chains , integrating equation  ( [ eq : gauss ] ) , we find @xmath72 . for saws , we may estimate the force summing the results for @xmath73 and obtaining the remaining contributions ( @xmath74 ) using the asymptotic result @xmath75 where @xmath76 was estimated using the result of @xmath62 for @xmath77 .",
    "the result of this calculation is @xmath78 , larger than the one for gaussian chains .",
    "as mentioned above , it does not seem straightforward to compare the two models , since a gaussian chain is a mass - spring model and therefore it is , unlike saws , not athermal .",
    "we may also mention that if @xmath62 for saws is extended to real values of @xmath21 using a numerical interpolation procedure and the data for gaussian chains are rescaled so the areas below both curves are the same , the difference between the curves is quite small , the maximum being close to the origin and of order @xmath79 . due to the limited precision of the estimates for saws and to the expected small dependency of the results on the interpolation procedure we will not present these results here , but we found that in general the rescaled results for the pressure of gaussian chains are larger than the pressures for saws at small values of @xmath21 , but the inverse situation is found for larger distances .",
    "this net effect may be understood if we recall that the pressure is a monotonically growing function of the local density at the wall ( eq .  ( [ pdens ] ) ) and that the effect of the excluded volume interactions should be a slower decay of this density with the distance from the grafting point , as compared to approximations where this interaction is neglected .",
    "it is of some interest to obtain the total force applied to the chain at the grafting point for ideal chains , modeled by random walks on the semi - infinite square lattice .",
    "this force may be calculated considering the shift of the grafting point by one lattice unit in the positive @xmath35 direction in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "the change in free energy under this operation will be proportional to the force .",
    "this calculations should lead to the same result of the ones above , where the force was obtained summing over the pressures at all other sites of the wall besides the origin , since the total force applied on the chain has to vanish .",
    "let us start by briefly reviewing the calculation of the number of random walks on a half - plane of the square lattice .",
    "if we call @xmath80 the number of @xmath7-steps random walks on a square lattice starting at the origin and ending at the point @xmath81 , the number of rws on the half - plane @xmath9 may be calculated by placing an absorbing wall at @xmath82 , so that any walk reaching the wall is annihilated .",
    "this may be accomplished by using an image walker , starting at the reflection point of the origin with respect to the wall and ending at @xmath83 .",
    "we will place the starting point of the random walk at @xmath84 , where @xmath85 corresponds to walks starting at the origin . in this case",
    "the image walker starting point will be at @xmath86 , with distances measured in units of the lattice constant @xmath2 .",
    "the number of walks confined to the @xmath9 half plane is given by @xcite @xmath87 since we are interested in the large @xmath7 limit , we may use the gaussian approximation for the number of walks @xmath88 for the half - plane we get @xmath89\\ ] ] to obtain the total number of walks , we integrate this expression over the final point @xmath83 @xmath90 the result is @xmath91 for @xmath92 , we have the asymptotic behavior @xmath93 which has the expected scaling form ( [ eq : gf ] ) , with exponent @xmath94 and amplitude @xmath95 . the change in free energy between the cases with @xmath85 and @xmath96 is therefore given by @xmath97 , so that the force applied to the polymer by the wall at the grafting point",
    "will be @xmath98 , which is lower than the forces obtained for gaussian chains and estimated for saws .",
    "it should be mentioned that for saws the sum of the pressures corresponding to two distances @xmath99 is always smaller ( for finite @xmath100 ) than @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the change in free energy when both cells , at @xmath103 and @xmath104 are excluded .",
    "in other words , an effective attractive interaction exists between the two excluded cells , so that the free energy decreases as the cells approach each other .",
    "this effect is due to walks in the unrestricted case which visit both excluded cells , and are therefore not counted in either @xmath105 or @xmath106 .",
    "the total force @xmath107 , resulting from the simultaneous exclusion of all cells besides the one at the grafting point r = 0 , must thus be smaller than the force @xmath108 defined in equation ( [ ftotal ] ) .",
    "it is easy to find , since the number of saws with @xmath7 steps @xmath109 in this case is given by @xmath110 , that for a given value of @xmath7 the force at the grafting point will be @xmath111 .",
    "for large @xmath7 , we get @xmath112 , smaller than @xmath113 , as expected .",
    "finally , we should also stress that although the pressure applied by the saws and by the gaussian chains display a similar power - law behavior , other possible walks on the lattice might lead to different results .",
    "recently the pressure exerted by directed walks starting at the origin on the limiting line of a semi - infinite square lattice was obtained @xcite . in the limit of large directed walks the asymptotic decay of the pressure with the distance to the grafting point also follows a power law , albeit with an exponent smaller than the one obtained here for saws and gaussian chains .",
