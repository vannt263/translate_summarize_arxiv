    "the recently completed cern neutrinos to gran sasso ( cngs ) programme made use of @xmath79gev protons from the sps over a nominal year with 200 days of operation , 55% machine availability , and 60% of the sps supercycle .",
    "this produced a total of @xmath80 protons on target per year .",
    "the experiment described here assumes the same fraction of beam time as cngs and the current sps performance . in particular",
    ", the preliminary investigation of the operational mode assumes minimal modification to the sps , maximises the use of the existing transfer lines and is compatible with the operation of both the lhc and the north area fixed target programmes as they are currently implemented .",
    "increased experimental reach could come as a by - product of a future sps upgrade from a proton spill intensity of about @xmath81 protons per pulse to @xmath82 protons per pulse .",
    "the design of the proposed experiment aims at taking advantage of such an upgrade but the experiment does not rely on it .      from the general considerations given above",
    ", the experimental requirements favour the choice of a relatively long extraction to reduce the detector occupancy per unit time , and to allow a simple target design based on dense materials . at the same time , the extraction type should not affect significantly the sps cycle time as compared to cngs , and should respect the constraints on the activation levels in the extraction region and the risk of damage to the extraction septum .",
    "several options exist , all of which may be acceptable from the point of view of the experiment , but the optimal choice requires further study :    * slow extraction with a spill length of @xmath83s .",
    "this would mean a @xmath84s sps spill cycle , and consequently a reduction of the number of protons on target by 10% ; * fast non - coherent resonant extraction of o(1ms ) ; * fast extraction similar to that of cngs of o(@xmath85s ) .",
    "the first two options involve extraction with the sps rf system off and the beams debunched .",
    "this produces a quasi - continuous spill that is compatible with a continuous detector readout , as described in section  [ ssec : synergy ] .",
    "the first two extraction methods result in a lower detector occupancy .    with lifetimes of @xmath86s , the dominant fraction of @xmath49 mesons decay before interacting in the target , regardless of the target material .",
    "however , the flux of secondary pions and kaons , which give rise to a substantial muon flux from decays in flight , can be greatly reduced by the use of a dense target material with a short interaction length .",
    "for example , the use of tungsten , rather than graphite , reduces the number of decaying pions and kaons by an order of magnitude .",
    "a 50  cm long tungsten target would suffice .",
    "however , the beam energy density must then be diluted in order to avoid destructive thermal shock waves in the target and to allow effective heat extraction .",
    "it may be possible to extract the deposited beam energy using water cooling .    since the neutrinos produced in charm decays , which can mix with hnls , have in any case a relatively high transverse momentum ( see fig .  [ pthnl ] )",
    ", there is no requirement to have a small beam spot .",
    "the beam line design can then be driven purely by the technical requirements and constraints .",
    "for the same reason , the experiment does not impose stringent constraints on the optical parameters of the extracted beam .",
    "the dilution of the beam energy deposition mentioned above may therefore be obtained by allowing the transverse size of the beam to increase in a dedicated section of the primary beam line , and by using a combination of orthogonally deflecting kicker magnets to produce a lissajous sweep across the target , similar to the lhc beam dump .",
    "preliminary investigation shows that it should be possible to achieve a beam spot size of about @xmath87 mm on the target and a sweep diameter of several centimetres , with the only constraint being a beam divergence less than the natural divergence of the produced hnls .",
    "beam losses in the straight section leading to the target must be minimised and monitored to reduce the background neutrino flux .",
    "the use of a slow extraction would simplify the target design . to prevent damage to the target caused by possible failures in the beam line",
    ", the beam extraction would need to be interlocked with the magnet currents in the dedicated transfer line .",
    "the proton target will be required to withstand a beam power of @xmath88kw , corresponding to @xmath89 protons per @xmath90s at @xmath79gev .",
    "detailed thermo - mechanical studies will be required in order to produce a technical design .      to stop the remaining secondary pions and kaons before they decay",
    ", a hadron absorber will immediately follow the target . by surrounding the target ,",
    "the absorber will also stop pions and kaons at large angles which may otherwise produce muons that enter the fiducial volume due to large angle scattering .",
    "the absorber will also provide the first level of lateral radiation shielding , as well as absorbing the residual non - interacting protons ( @xmath91 of the incident proton flux ) and the electromagnetic radiation generated in the target .",
    "the physical dimensions of the absorber are driven by the radiological requirements on the muon shield ( see section  [ ssec : mushield ] below ) . as part of the absorber",
    ", a concrete shielding wall will close - off the target bunker volume from the downstream muon shield tunnel .",
    "the muon flux after the hadron absorber is estimated from a sample of @xmath92 @xmath93 events generated with pythia with a proton beam energy of 400gev and a fixed proton target .",
    "the prompt component of the muon flux originates from the electromagnetic decays of meson resonances , mainly @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "the non - prompt component originates mainly from the decay in flight of charged pions and kaons .",
    "for the present estimates , only the decays of primary pions and kaons are considered as non - prompt sources .",
    "secondary , tertiary , or higher order pion or kaon decays should give a softer momentum spectrum that is more easily attenuated than the high - energy primary pion and kaon decays that drive the requirement on the muon shield length .",
    "the exact radial extent of the muon shield will be defined based on a detailed simulation to ensure that the muons from higher order interactions , which generally have larger polar angles , are also absorbed .",
    "the dense target and the hadron absorber described above will be designed to stop all hadrons . however , a fraction @xmath98 of the hadrons entering the absorber will decay into muons before interacting , where @xmath99 is the interaction length of hadrons in the hadron absorber ; @xmath100 is the decay length of the hadron and @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath45 are the hadron lifetime , lab momentum and rest mass ; and @xmath103 is the branching fraction for the decay of the hadron to muons ( 100% for @xmath104 and 63% for @xmath105 , other muon - producing decay channels are neglected ) .",
    "a cross - check with the muon fluxes observed in the charm `` beam dump '' experiment  @xcite indicates that the above method for estimating the `` first - generation '' muon flux gives the correct order of magnitude .",

    "[ fig : setup - sketch ] .",
    "the proposed beam line arrangement consists of a proton beam impinging on a @xmath106  m long target , followed by a hadron absorber of @xmath107  m length , a shielding wall to confine air and radiation , and a @xmath108  m long uranium or tungsten muon absorber enclosed in iron and concrete .",
    "the experiment requires a new switching section from an existing beam line , which can be very similar to the one already used for the cngs facility . a short section of transfer line , consisting almost entirely of drift length to allow the beam energy density to be reduced , will then bring the high energy protons to the target bunker that contains the target and the hadron absorber .",
    "the site of the experiment should be such that it allows use of existing infrastructure .",
    "in particular , the site will need to be provisioned with the equipment to handle air and water activation , to comply with radiation protection standards .",
    "the site should also be well within the cern boundaries .",
    "both construction and operation of the beam line and the detector can be such that the interference caused to running facilities is minimised .    based on these requirements and constraints ,",
    "the north area could provide a suitable location with a relatively short transfer line of a few hundred metres , branching - off from tt20 , with a new beam splitting near to the tdc2 splitter area .",
    "the beam deflection could then be arranged to allow the dedicated transfer line to point to a target bunker at sufficient depth and distance from the tcc2 target area to minimise the excavation in activated soil .",
    "soil tests will be needed to determine the exact location . a 60 m trenched tunnel after the target bunker would allow the installation of the muon shield , and an area at relatively low elevation just before the north area hall would provide a suitable site for the location of the surface detector building .",
    "the location of the proposed target bunker near to the tcc2 target area suggests that it may be possible to benefit from the general refurbishments that are already foreseen for the current target area in terms of activated water and air treatment .",
    "the detector consists of a long decay volume followed by a spectrometer .",
    "for a given detector length , the detector diameter should be maximised . in the discussion below the 5 m aperture of the lhcb spectrometer  @xcite",
    "is taken as a realistic scale .",
    "figure  [ length ] shows a scan of the length of the detector for both a single detector element and for two longitudinally arranged detector elements . for a given hnl lifetime and detector aperture , the number of hnls decaying in the apparatus with the decay products going through the spectrometer saturates as a function of the length of the detector .",
    "the use of two magnetic spectrometers increases the geometric acceptance by 70% compared to a single element .",

    "figure  [ magnet - scketch ] shows a sketch of a magnet which fulfills the requirements of the proposed experiment  @xcite .        with a yoke with outer dimension of @xmath120m@xmath121 , and two al-99.7 coils",
    ", the proposed magnet provides a peak field of @xmath122 t , and a @xmath123tm over a length of @xmath124 m . for comparison ,",
    "the lhcb magnet mentioned above contains @xmath125 more iron for its yoke , and dissipates three times more power .",
    "the proposed experiment will require two @xmath11050 m long , 5 m diameter vacuum tanks each of which will be similar to that used in the na62 experiment  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath109 mbar vacuum required to suppress neutrino interactions ( see section  [ sec : bg ] ) , is several orders of magnitude less demanding than the pressure used in the na62 vacuum tank ( @xmath126 mbar ) and should therefore not represent a technological challenge .",
    "the tracking stations of the magnetic spectrometer must provide good spatial resolution and minimise the contribution from multiple scattering .",
    "the na62 straw tracker tubes  @xcite , which are manufactured from thin polyethylene terephthalate ( pet ) , are ideal to meet both of these goals .",
    "gas tightness of these tubes has been demonstrated in long term tests and the mass production procedure is also well established .",
    "the reconstruction of @xmath115 mesons and the identification of electrons would be required to reconstruct decays such as @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "an electromagnetic calorimeter with a modest energy resolution will therefore substantially improve the discovery potential of the proposed experiment .",
    "the lhcb shashlik calorimeter has demonstrated an energy resolution of @xmath129 , which is comparable to the momentum resolution of the proposed magnetic spectrometer in the 10 to 20gev energy range .",
    "the shashlik technology also provides an economical solution with fine granularity , as well as time resolution better than a few ns , which will be needed to correlate the calorimeter and tracker information .",
    "the sps provides a quasi - continuous flux of protons on target over its extraction period .",
    "a dead - timeless readout system such as that envisaged for the lhcb upgrade  @xcite would suffice for the proposed experiment .",
    "this readout system will record data continuously in 25ns time - slices .",
    "the data will be pushed out to read - out boards which in turn will push the data to a pc - farm to perform the event building .",
    "tracks with matching times will be combined to form two - prong vertices , and events with good vertices will be maintained for further analysis .",
    "this part of the selection will be executed on - line in the event building farm to reduce the data storage rate to a negligible level .",
    "it is estimated that storage of @xmath11010tb / year would be required .",
    "the muon shield described above is designed to stop muons with momenta of up to 400gev , thus reducing muon - induced backgrounds to a negligible level .",
    "the rate of charged - current neutrino interactions ( cc ) occurring at the downstream end of the muon shield is estimated by extrapolating from a measurement by charm  @xcite , which used 400gev protons impinging on a cu target . to extrapolate this measurement to the proposed geometry",
    ", the angular and momentum distributions of the neutrinos are simulated using pythia  @xcite .",
    "this results in an expected cc rate in the last interaction length of the muon shield of @xmath130 per @xmath131 protons on target if a cu target were used . as a cross - check geant  @xcite",
    "is used to simulate the neutrino spectrum produced by a 400gev proton beam on a cu target .",
    "this yields a cc rate four times larger than the estimate based on the charm data .",
    "replacing the cu target by a w target lowers the cc rate by @xmath132% .",
    "the neutrinos from the geant simulation using a w target are passed to genie  @xcite to simulate the cc and neutral - current ( nc ) neutrino interactions in the muon shield .",
    "this yields a cc(nc ) rate of @xmath133 per interaction length per @xmath131 protons on target .",
    "conservatively , this rate is used to evaluate the background .",
    "neutrino interactions in the decay volume could be a source of background . in a decay volume filled with air under atmospheric pressure",
    ", the above rate translates into @xmath134 neutrino interactions per @xmath131 protons on target . a pressure in the decay volume of 0.01 mbar reduces this rate to a negligible level .",
    "another source of background is the rate of the neutrino interactions that occur in the muon shield just upstream of the decay volume . a combination of geant and genie is used to predict that in @xmath114% of the neutrino interactions a @xmath135 or @xmath136 will be produced .",
    "this prediction is consistent with measurements by nomad  @xcite . in the first 5 m of the decay volume two - prong vertices",
    "are mainly from @xmath135 and @xmath137 decays . for the remaining 35 m of the decay volume @xmath138% of two - prong vertices",

    "requiring one of the two decay tracks to be identified as a muon , yields @xmath140 two - prong vertices in @xmath131 protons on target . owing to their different kinematics ,",
    "the geometrical acceptance of @xmath139 decay products is significantly smaller than that of hnl decay products .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]    requiring ip@xmath141 m reduces this background to a handful of candidates for @xmath131 protons on target , while the ip of all signal candidates is below 1 m .",
    "the ip of candidates will also be used to reject possible background induced in neutrino interactions in the surrounding material , like the vacuum tank or the floor , and from cosmic rays .",
    "backgrounds that originate from neutrino interactions could be vetoed by detecting the associated activity produced in the associated shower , especially the lepton in cc interactions .",
    "this signature has not been exploited yet in the above yields and could be used to reduce the background to a negligible level .",
    "more detailed simulation studies will be undertaken to optimise the position of the veto stations at the entrance of the decay volume .",
    "if shown to be advantageous , the last interaction lengths of both the muon shield and the muon filter could be instrumented in order to detect the products of neutrino interactions .",
    "the sensitivity of the proposed experiment depends on the final states used to reconstruct the signal decays and the pattern of couplings between the neutrino generations and the hnls .",
    "the region in @xmath142 that can be probed by the proposed experiment is conservatively estimated by assuming only the decay @xmath143 is used and considering the production mechanism @xmath144 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath142 and @xmath68 is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . as detailed in section  [ sec : exp_status ] , the present strongest limits on @xmath142 come from the charm experiment  @xcite and are at the @xmath41 level for a mass of 1.5gev and a few times @xmath145 for a mass of 1gev . the theoretically allowed region for @xmath146 is between @xmath41 and @xmath147 .",
    "the expected number of signal events for the proposed experiment is given by @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the total number of protons on target , @xmath150 is the ratio of the @xmath151 production cross - section with respect to the total cross - section ( the factor 2 accounts for the fact that charm is produced in pairs ) , @xmath152 is the total efficiency and @xmath153 is the product of the production and decay branching fractions of the hnls .",
    "the quantity @xmath152 can be written as the product of the probability that the hnls decay in the fiducial volume and the trigger and reconstruction efficiencies .",
    "the probability of decay is estimated with simulated events for different values of @xmath142 and the efficiencies are assumed to be 100% .",
    "the dependence on the hnl lifetime introduces a @xmath142 factor in @xmath152 .",
    "since the quantities @xmath153 and @xmath152 each depend on a factor @xmath142 , this results in an overall @xmath154 dependence .    assuming @xmath155 , a hnl mass of 1gev , @xmath156 , @xmath157s and @xmath158 , @xmath159 fully reconstructed @xmath160 events would be observed , four orders of magnitudes larger than the number that would be expected in the charm experiment . considering a point in the cosmologically favoured region with @xmath161 , @xmath162s and @xmath163gev ,",
    "120 fully reconstructed @xmath164 events would be expected in the proposed experiment .",
    "the electromagnetic calorimeter allows the reconstruction of decay modes with a neutral pion in the final state such as @xmath75 , where the @xmath165 , allowing the signal yields to be doubled .",
    "channels with electrons , such as @xmath166 , could also be studied , allowing a further increase in the yields and the parameter @xmath167 to be probed .",
    "other decay channels with a sm neutrino in the final state , e.g.  @xmath168 , are more challenging to select , since the invariant mass will have a broad distribution but could be separated from the background by using particle identification information .",
    "both the background levels and the total neutrino flux will be measured by the experiment itself .",
    "the neutrino flux from charm - meson decays is more difficult to obtain experimentally .",
    "a study of the @xmath169 distribution of neutrino events in the calorimeter together with existing 400gev pcu data  @xcite and a detailed simulation will provide a normalisation .    in summary , for a hnl",
    "mass below 2gev the proposed experiment has discovery potential for the cosmologically favoured region with @xmath146 between @xmath41 and a few times @xmath170 .      fixed target experiments of the type proposed could be performed using both the fermilab and kek proton beams .",
    "the beams considered are the 800gev and 120gev fnal beams with @xmath171 protons on target and @xmath172 protons on target , respectively ; and the kek 30gev beam with @xmath173 protons on target .    at fnal , the 800gev beam would give a similar hnl flux to that of the proposed sps experiment , i.e.  the lower proton intensity would be approximately compensated by the increase in the charm cross - section at higher energy  @xcite .",
    "however , a significantly longer muon filter would be required due to the higher beam energy , which would be much more challenging , leading to a significant loss of acceptance .",
    "the fnal 120gev beam would have a factor ten lower event yield than in the proposed sps experiment , while the kek beam would have a factor 1.52 lower yield , the latter estimate has a large uncertainty due to the poor knowledge of the charm cross - section at low energy .",
    "the sensitivity of a colliding beam experiment at the cern lhc is estimated assuming a luminosity of 1000fb@xmath174 and an energy of 14tev , as is foreseen in three to four years of running for the high luminosity upgrade .",
    "the hnl decay volume is taken to be located 60 m away from the interaction region and 50mrad off - axis , in order to avoid the lhc beam line .",
    "the overall hnl event yield would be a factor approximately 200 smaller than in the proposed sps experiment .",
    "although masses of the hnls are expected to be around the gev - scale , it is possible that they are heavier than @xmath49 mesons .",
    "if the hnls are lighter than @xmath1105gev , they can be produced in beauty hadron decays .",
    "the most copious hnl production mechanism with @xmath175 mesons would be the semileptonic @xmath176 decays and the total available mass would therefore be restricted to less than @xmath177gev .",
    "the reduced cross - section for the production of beauty mesons with respect to charm mesons means that the limits that could be derived from a dedicated experiment at the lhc would be about four orders of magnitude weaker than those from charm decays .",
    "such limits would then be comparable to the upper limits from the theoretical consideration of the baryon asymmetry .",
    "the sps at cern is therefore the ideal facility to conduct the proposed experiment to search for hnls .",
    "the proposed experiment will search for new physics in the largely unexplored domain of new , very weakly interacting particles with masses below the fermi scale .",
    "this domain is inaccessible to the lhc experiments and to comparable experiments at other existing facilities .",
    "the proposed detector is based on existing technologies and therefore requires no substantial r&d phase .",
    "a moderately sized collaboration could construct the proposed detector in a few years .",
    "the design of the beam line is challenging , in particular , the beam extraction and beam target , as well as the radiological aspects require further study .",
    "the solutions proposed are being actively discussed with machine experts .",
    "the impact that a discovery of a hnl would have on particle physics is difficult to overestimate . in short ,",
    "it could solve two of the most important shortcomings of the sm : the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe , the origin of neutrino mass .",
    "in addition , the results of this experiment , together with cosmological and astrophysical data , could be crucial to determine the nature of dark matter .",
