    "the 21st century holds great promise for reaching a new era for unlocking the mysteries of the inner quark - gluon structure of the atomic nucleus and the nucleons inside it as governed by the theory of strong interactions ( qcd ) . the experimental program at the upgraded 12 gev jefferson laboratory @xcite , currently nearing completion , will play an important role in this quest , and revolutionize the current understanding of the dynamics of the fundamental quarks and gluons that create the wide and varied structure of hadrons and nuclei .",
    "hall c with its heavily - shielded detector setup in a highly - focusing magnetic spectrometer with large momentum reach will be the optimal hall for certain classes of deep exclusive and semi - inclusive measurements , and in particular those requiring high quality rosenbluth ( or longitudinal - transverse - l / t ) cross section separations .",
    "the hall  c base experimental equipment consists of two magnetic spectrometers : the high momentum spectrometer ( hms ) @xcite and the super high momentum spectrometer ( shms ) @xcite . depending on the specific requirements of the experiments , they can detect either negatively or positively charged particles by choosing the magnetic field and the trigger configuration .",
    "the hms is designed to detect secondary products of reactions in the momentum range from 0.5 to 7.3 gev/@xmath4 , while the shms momentum range extends up to about 12 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "both spectrometers are equipped with a pair of drift chambers , pairs of timing scintillator hodoscopes for trigger formation , and various detectors for particle identification purposes , including the aerogel erenkov detector .",
    "a schematic of the shms detector package is shown in fig .",
    "[ shms - hut ] .",
    "particle identification in the shms relies on time - of - flight measurements at lower momentum , an electromagnetic pre - shower and full shower calorimeter and erenkov detectors .",
    "a erenkov detector as filled with noble gases , and the calorimeter will be used for @xmath8 separation , while a separate erenkov detector filled with heavier gases such as c@xmath9f@xmath10o will provide @xmath11 identification above 3.4 gev/@xmath4 . to complete the necessary pid capability of the shms necessary to successfully carry out the strangeness physics part of the hall c program , the shms aerogel erenkov detector descriped in this paper was built to distinguish kaons from protons with momenta above 2.6 gev/@xmath4 .",

    "these experiments will provide high - quality cross section data , requiring detection of scattered mesons with momenta approaching 10 gev/@xmath4 , for which the shms in hall c is exceptionally well suited .",
    "however , additional instrumentation for @xmath13/@xmath14 particle identification is needed for the kaon measurement , which forms an essential part of this program .",
    "the `` @xmath15 in sidis '' experiment ( e12 - 09 - 017 )  @xcite will map the transverse momentum dependence of semi - inclusive electroproduction of charged mesons from both proton and deuteron targets . in this experiment it will be beneficial to also separate kaons from protons .",
    "the `` measurement of @xmath16=@xmath17/@xmath18 in sidis '' ( e12 - 06 - 104 )  @xcite will study the inclusive - exclusive connection in meson electroproduction , where duality has recently been shown to be valid and will be essential in understanding flavor decomposition in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering at 12 gev . with @xmath13/@xmath14 separation",
    "this measurement can access the additional flavors of strange systems .",
    "the `` pion transparency '' experiment ( e12 - 06 - 107 )  @xcite will map the transparency of the nuclear medium to pions and measure the approach to the qcd - calculable , or point - like , regime using the @xmath19 dependence of the ratio of cross sections from nucleon and nuclear targets .",
    "kaon transparency measurements may contribute additional information to our understanding of this approach .",
    "the general requirement for these experiments is a high detection efficiency for kaons in the shms and the capability to separate protons from kaons .",
    "the experiments plan to run with an electron beam with energy of up to 11 gev and beam currents between a few and 80 @xmath20a hitting liquid hydrogen or deuterium target cells with lengths about 10 cm , or selected solid targets , yielding particle rates in the shms detector stack of up to 2 mhz . to take full advantage of the existing shms standard detector configuration without compromising its performance , the additional aerogel erenkov detector system was designed with the following specifications :    * to have a sensitive area of at least 90@xmath2160 @xmath22 with a thickness of radiator up to 9  cm .",
    "* to fit into a small slot of about 30 cm between the heavy gas erenkov detector and the electromagnetic calorimeter ; * to minimize the material in the particle path to keep the amount of multiple scattering and @xmath23-electrons small ; * to allow easy exchange of the aerogel material to match the required kaon momentum range ; * to provide acceptable time resolution and a high - rate capability .    of the approved experiments , three ( e12 - 06 - 104 , e12 - 09 - 017 , and e12 - 07 - 105 ) only require kaon particle identification ( pid ) in the 2.7 - 5 gev/@xmath4 momentum range .",
    "higher momenta are relevant for the kaon factorization experiment ( e12 - 09 - 011 ) , up to 7.2 gev / c , and the pion transparency measurement , where kaon identification up to this momentum would allow extraction of kaon transparencies up to @xmath24 7 ( gev/@xmath4)@xmath25 . to take into account this range of experimental requirements , covering from about 2 to above 7  gev/@xmath4 momentum , the refractive indices characteristic of aerogel material are well suited for this purpose .    to maintain good @xmath26 separation over this full kinematic range",
    ", we chose a range of aerogel materials , with nominal refractive indices of @xmath3=1.030 ( sp-30 ) , @xmath3=1.020 ( sp-20 ) , @xmath3=1.015 ( sp-15 ) , and @xmath3=1.011 ( sp-11 ) .",

    ", @xmath26 separation is achieved with aerogel with a refractive index of @xmath3=1.030 . beyond",
    ", the lower three refractive indices provide excellent @xmath26 separation in the momentum range between 4 and @xmath77 gev/@xmath4 .",
    "the aerogel material is characterized by a constant refractive index , and by wavelength - dependent absorption and scattering lengths , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the last 2 parameters were modeled in the simulation based on studies of aerogel optical properties carried out at desy @xcite . for light of wavelengths @xmath30300 nm the transmittance through the aerogel is described to good accuracy by the hunt formula @xcite which assumes constant absorption ( constant @xmath28 ) and rayleigh scattering ( @xmath31 ) . below 300 nm",
    "@xmath28 dramatically decreases , and @xmath29 changes less rapidly .",
    "absorption and scattering lengths of the aerogel used in the simulations include a constant absorption length for @xmath30 300 nm linearly decreasing to 1 cm at @xmath32 200 nm in accordance with ref .",
    "@xcite . the constant value for @xmath30 300 nm was tuned using data from cosmic tests with the shms aerogel erenov detector ( see section  [ cosmic_tests_detector ] ) and optimized for the optimum sensitivity of our pmts , around 450 nm .",
    "a value of @xmath28=90 cm gives the best agreement between simulation and data for sp-30 and sp-20 aerogels .",
    "this value is also consistent with our direct measurement of the absorption length at 450 nm as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : aero_spall_abscoeff ] . for the lower refractive index aerogels , which were produced by a different vendor",
