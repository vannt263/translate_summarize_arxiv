    "given a manifold @xmath1 and a _ tower of coverings _ of @xmath1 , i.e. a sequence @xmath2 of finite covers , one can ask about the growth of topological invariants for the manifolds in the sequence .",
    "such questions were particularly studied in the case that @xmath1 is a hyperbolic 3-manifold of finite volume .",
    "this led to interesting conjectures which relate the growth of invariants of the sequence to invariants of hyperbolic 3-space .",
    "more concretely , it is expected that in the case of a tower of congruence covers of a closed arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifold , the growth rate of the torsion @xmath3 in the first homology group coincides with the @xmath4-torsion of @xmath5 , which equals @xmath6 ( conjecture 1.4 in @xcite proposes a slightly weaker statement ) . in special cases , this conjecture has been verified in @xcite .",
    "much earlier , silver and williams @xcite related the torsion growth in the first homology of a knot complement @xmath1 for a tower @xmath7 of cyclic covers arising from the first homology group of @xmath1 ( which equals @xmath8 ) to the logarithmic mahler measure of the alexander polynomial of the knot .",
    "this is possible since the @xmath8-cover @xmath9 of a knot complement @xmath1 is @xmath4-acylic and hence the growth rate of @xmath3 equals the @xmath4-torsion of @xmath9 .",
    "we refer to theorem 7.3 of @xcite for a clear exposition . for many knot complements ,",
    "this logarithmic mahler measure is positive and hence one obtains towers of cyclic covers with exponential torsion homology growth .",
    "generalizations of the results in @xcite are due to raimbault @xcite , bergeron and venkatesh ( section 7 of @xcite ) and le @xcite .",
    "any closed 3-manifold @xmath1 admits a _",
    "heegaard decomposition_. this means that @xmath1 can be obtained by glueing two _ handlebodies _ of some genus @xmath10 with a diffeomorphism of their boundaries .",
    "the smallest genus of a handlebody which gives rise to @xmath1 in this way is called the _ heegaard genus _ of @xmath1 .",
    "isotopic diffeomorphisms yield the same manifold ,",
    "so for a fixed base identification , the manifold @xmath1 only depends on the element in the _ mapping class group _",
    "@xmath11 defined by the glueing diffeomorphism of the boundary surface @xmath12 of the handlebody ( in fact , by a double coset in @xmath11 ) .",
    "thus the question on the existence of towers of covers with prescribed torsion homology growth is directly related to properties of the mapping class group .",
    "this viewpoint was used by dunfield and thurston @xcite to define the notion of a _",
    "random 3-manifold _ using a random walk on the mapping class group . embarking from @xcite ,",
    "the purpose of this work is to study the growth of cyclic covers of random hyperbolic 3-manifolds with positive first betti number . for @xmath13",
    "we denote by @xmath14 the closed @xmath0-manifold defined by the gluing map @xmath15 .",
    "[ thm : main - theorem - plain ] let @xmath12 be a surface of genus @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath17 be a measure on the torelli group @xmath18 whose finite support generates @xmath19 as a semigroup .",
    "let @xmath20 be the @xmath21 fold convolution of @xmath17 . then the mass assigned by @xmath20 to the set of @xmath22 such that the @xmath0manifold @xmath14 admits a tower of cyclic covers with exponential torsion homology growth converges to one .",
    "in other words , the probability that the @xmath0manifold @xmath14 admits a tower of cyclic covers with exponential torsion homology growth converges to one .",
    "in fact , let @xmath23 be a surjection , and let @xmath24 denote the cover of @xmath14 defined by the map @xmath25 which factors through @xmath26 .    then with probability one the limit @xmath27 exists and is positive .",
    "an analogous result remains true if we consider random walks not on the torelli group @xmath19 ( which is known to be finitely generated for @xmath16 ) , but on a _ homology stabilizer _ which is defined to be the subgroup of @xmath11 of all mapping classes preserving some fixed homology class .",
    "for the second part of the conclusion , one then requires that @xmath26 is dual to this homology class .    in section [ sec : setup ]",
    "we explain that any @xmath0manifold @xmath1 with heegaard genus @xmath28 and first betti number @xmath29 is obtained as @xmath14 for some @xmath22 .",
    "similarly , any @xmath0manifold @xmath1 with heegaard genus @xmath28 and positive first betti number is obtained as @xmath14 for some @xmath15 in a homology stabiliser .",
    "thus the main theorem has the intuitive interpretation : random hyperbolic 3-manifolds with positive first betti number admit a tower of cyclic covers with exponential torsion homology growth",
    ".    we do not discuss the rate of convergence although this can be done with standard methods , see section 7.6 of @xcite for more on this idea .    using a different approach ,",
    "liu @xcite proved very recently that every closed hyperbolic @xmath0manifold admits a tower of covers with exponential torsion homology growth .",
    "the covers he constructs are however in general not normal .",
    "the methods used in the proof of theorem  [ thm : main - theorem - plain ] can also be used to show that the first betti number of a random hyperbolic three - manifold @xmath14 does not increase by passing to a finite abelian cover of fixed degree .",
    "[ thm : dt ] fix some abelian cover @xmath30 of the surface of genus @xmath31 , and denote by @xmath32 the induced cover of @xmath0manifolds .    for any random walk on the torelli group @xmath19 ( or the homology stabiliser of the curve defining the cover @xmath33 ) , the probability that @xmath34 converges to @xmath35 .",
    "theorem  9.1 in @xcite shows that for a fixed number @xmath36 , a random hyperbolic 3-manifold of heegard genus two does not admit an abelian cover of degree at most @xmath37 with positive first betti number , where random refers to a random walk on the entire mapping class group .",
    "our methods can be adapted to extend the result of @xcite to arbitrary genus , as outlined in the last section .",
    "we chose instead to focus on the version stated in theorem [ thm : dt ] as its formulation is closer to the formulation of theorem [ thm : main - theorem - plain ] .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : main - theorem - plain ] rests on the relation between the growth rate of torsion in the homology for a tower of cyclic covers of the three - manifold @xmath14 and the mahler measure of the alexander polynomial of the corresponding infinite cyclic covering",

    "we translate the condition of positive logarithmic mahler measure into a condition that is detectable in finite covers .",
    "we then construct a homomorphism of the torelli group into an algebraic group acting on a compact projective variety . using earlier work of looijenga @xcite , in section [ sec :",
