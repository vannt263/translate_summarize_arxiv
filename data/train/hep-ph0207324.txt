    "an important element in the testing of the kobayashi  maskawa picture of cp violation is the direct determination of the angle @xmath0 of the unitarity triangle of the ckm matrix . here",
    "the goal is to overconstrain this angle as much as possible . in the presence of new physics",
    ", discrepancies may arise between different strategies , as well as with the `` indirect '' results for @xmath0 that are provided by the usual fits of the unitarity triangle , yielding at present @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "there are many approaches on the market to determine @xmath0 ( for a detailed review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "we shall focus on @xmath1 modes @xcite@xcite , which can be analysed through flavour - symmetry arguments and plausible dynamical assumptions , and the @xmath8-spin - related decays @xmath9 , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding flavour - symmetry strategies allow the determination of @xmath0 and valuable hadronic parameters with a `` minimal '' theoretical input .",
    "alternative approaches , relying on a more extensive use of theory , are provided by the recently developed `` qcd factorization '' @xcite and `` pqcd '' @xcite approaches , which allow furthermore a reduction of the theoretical uncertainties of the flavour - symmetry strategies discussed here .",
    "let us note that these approaches are also particularly promising from a practical point of view : babar , belle and cleo - iii may probe @xmath0 through @xmath1 modes , whereas the @xmath8-spin strategy , requiring also a measurement of the @xmath10-meson decay @xmath3 , is already interesting for run ii of the tevatron @xcite , and can be fully exploited in the lhc era @xcite .",
    "a variant for the @xmath5-factories @xcite , where @xmath3 is replaced by @xmath6 , points already to an exciting picture @xcite .",
    "using the isospin flavour symmetry of strong interactions , relations between @xmath1 amplitudes can be derived , which suggest the following combinations to probe @xmath0 : the `` mixed '' @xmath12 , @xmath6 system @xcite@xcite , the `` charged '' @xmath12 , @xmath13 system @xcite@xcite , and the `` neutral '' @xmath14 , @xmath6 system @xcite .",
    "interestingly , already cp - averaged @xmath1 branching ratios may lead to non - trivial constraints on @xmath0 @xcite . in order to _ determine _ this angle ,",
    "also cp - violating rate differences have to be measured . to this end , we introduce the following observables @xcite : @xmath15\\frac{\\tau_{b^+}}{\\tau_{b^0_d}}\\ ] ] @xmath16\\ ] ] @xmath17.\\ ] ]    if we employ the isospin flavour symmetry and make plausible dynamical assumptions , concerning mainly the smallness of certain rescattering processes , we obtain parametrizations of the following structure @xcite ( for alternative ones , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath18 here @xmath19 denotes the ratio of electroweak ( ew ) penguins to `` trees '' , @xmath20 is the ratio of `` trees '' to qcd penguins , and @xmath21 the strong phase between `` trees '' and qcd penguins .",
    "the ew penguin parameters @xmath19 can be fixed through theoretical arguments : in the mixed system @xcite@xcite , we have @xmath22 , as ew penguins contribute only in colour - suppressed form ; in the charged and neutral @xmath1 systems , @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be fixed through the @xmath25 flavour symmetry without dynamical assumptions @xcite@xcite .",
    "the @xmath20 can be determined with the help of additional experimental information : in the mixed system , @xmath26 can be fixed through arguments based on factorization @xcite or @xmath8-spin @xcite , whereas @xmath27 and @xmath28 can be determined from the cp - averaged @xmath29 branching ratio by using only the @xmath25 flavour symmetry @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties arising in this programme from @xmath25-breaking effects can be reduced through the qcd factorization approach @xcite , which is moreover in favour of small rescattering processes . for simplicity",
    ", we shall neglect such fsi effects in the discussion given below .",
    "since we are in a position to fix the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we may determine @xmath21 and @xmath0 from the observables given in ( [ obs - par ] ) .",
    "this can be done separately for the mixed , charged and neutral @xmath1 systems .",
    "it should be emphasized that also cp - violating rate differences have to be measured to this end .",
    "using just the cp - conserving observables @xmath30 , we may obtain interesting constraints on @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the strong phase @xmath21 suffers from large hadronic uncertainties .",
    "however , we can get rid of @xmath21 by keeping it as a `` free '' variable , yielding minimal and maximal values for @xmath30 : @xmath31 keeping in addition @xmath20 as a free variable , we obtain another  less restrictive  minimal value @xmath32 these extremal values of @xmath30 imply constraints on @xmath0 , since the cases corresponding to @xmath33 and @xmath34 are excluded .",
    "present experimental data seem to point towards values for @xmath0 that are _ larger _ than @xmath35 , which would be in conflict with the ckm fits , favouring @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the present experimental uncertainties do not yet allow us to draw definite conclusions , but the picture should improve significantly in the future .",
    "an efficient way to represent the situation in the @xmath1 system is provided by allowed regions in the @xmath30@xmath37 planes @xcite , which can be derived within the standard model and allow a direct comparison with the experimental data .",
    "a complementary analysis in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath38 was performed in ref .",
    "another recent @xmath1 study can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath39 were calculated for given values of @xmath40 as functions of @xmath0 , and were compared with the @xmath5-factory data . in order to analyse @xmath1 modes , also certain sum rules may be useful @xcite .",
    "as can be seen from the corresponding feynman diagrams , @xmath3 is related to @xmath2 through an interchange of all down and strange quarks .",
    "the decay amplitudes read as follows @xcite : @xmath41,\\quad a(b_s^0\\to k^+k^-)\\propto \\left[e^{i\\gamma}+\\left(\\frac{1-\\lambda^2}{\\lambda^2}\\right ) d'e^{i\\theta'}\\right],\\ ] ] where the cp - conserving strong amplitudes @xmath42 and @xmath43 measure , sloppily speaking , ratios of penguin to tree amplitudes in @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively . using these general parametrizations ,",
    "we obtain expressions for the direct and mixing - induced cp asymmetries of the following kind : @xmath46 @xmath47    consequently , we have four observables at our disposal , depending on six `` unknowns ''",
    ". however , since @xmath2 and @xmath3 are related to each other by interchanging all down and strange quarks , the @xmath8-spin flavour symmetry of strong interactions implies @xmath48 using this relation , the four observables in ( [ bpipi - obs],[bskk - obs ] ) depend on the four quantities @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath0 , which can hence be determined @xcite . the theoretical accuracy is only limited by the @xmath8-spin symmetry , as no dynamical assumptions about rescattering processes have to be made .",
    "theoretical considerations give us confidence into ( [ u - spin - rel ] ) , as it does not receive @xmath8-spin - breaking corrections in factorization @xcite .",
    "moreover , we may also obtain experimental insights into @xmath8-spin breaking @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8-spin arguments can be minimized , if the @xmath52@xmath53 mixing phase @xmath51 , which can be fixed through @xmath54 , is used as an input .",
    "the observables @xmath55 and @xmath56 allow us then to eliminate the strong phase @xmath50 and to determine @xmath49 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "analogously , @xmath57 and @xmath58 allow us to eliminate the strong phase @xmath59 and to determine @xmath60 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the corresponding contours in the @xmath0@xmath49 and @xmath0@xmath60 planes can be fixed in a _ theoretically clean _ way .",
    "using now the @xmath8-spin relation @xmath61 , these contours allow the determination both of the ckm angle @xmath0 and of the hadronic quantities @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath59 ; for a detailed illustration , see ref .",
    "this approach is very promising for run ii of the tevatron and the experiments of the lhc era , where experimental accuracies for @xmath0 of @xmath62 @xcite and @xmath63 @xcite may be achieved , respectively .",
    "it should be emphasized that not only @xmath0 , but also the hadronic parameters @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath59 are of particular interest , as they can be compared with theoretical predictions , thereby allowing valuable insights into hadron dynamics . for other recently developed @xmath8-spin strategies ,",
    "the reader is referred to refs .",
    "a variant of the @xmath9 , @xmath3 approach was developed for the @xmath4 @xmath5-factories @xcite , where @xmath3 is not accessible : as @xmath3 and @xmath6 are related to each other through an interchange of the @xmath65 and @xmath49 spectator quarks , we may replace the @xmath10 mode approximately through its @xmath66 counterpart , which has already been observed by babar , belle and cleo . following these lines and using experimental information on the cp - averaged @xmath6 and @xmath2 branching ratios ,",
    "the relevant hadronic penguin parameters can be constrained , implying certain allowed regions in observable space @xcite .",
    "an interesting situation arises now in view of the recent @xmath5-factory measurements of cp violation in @xmath2 , allowing us to obtain new constraints on @xmath0 as a function of the @xmath52@xmath53 mixing phase @xmath67 , which is fixed through @xmath68 up to a twofold ambiguity , @xmath69 or @xmath70 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath71 is positive , as indicated by recent belle data , and that @xmath67 is in agreement with the `` indirect '' fits of the unitarity triangle , i.e.@xmath69 , also the corresponding values for @xmath0 around @xmath72 can be accommodated .",
    "on the other hand , for the second solution @xmath73 , we obtain a gap around @xmath36 , and could easily accommodate values for @xmath0 larger than @xmath35 .",
    "because of the connection between the two solutions for @xmath67 and the resulting values for @xmath0 , it is very desirable to resolve the twofold ambiguity in the extraction of @xmath67 directly . as far as @xmath3 is concerned ,",
    "the data on the cp - averaged @xmath9 , @xmath6 branching ratios imply a very constrained allowed region in the space of @xmath58 and @xmath57 within the standard model , thereby providing a narrow target range for run ii of the tevatron and the experiments of the lhc era @xcite .",
    "other recent studies related to @xmath2 can be found in refs .",
