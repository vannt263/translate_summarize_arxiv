    "a standard technique to study the formation and evolution of gravitating systems is to perform an @xmath1-body simulation in which the mass distribution is discretised into a series of softened point particles .",
    "this solution can be exact for a star cluster where each particle represents a single star , but for cosmological simulations of the dark matter each particle can be @xmath3 times larger than the gev mass candidates being simulated . in this approach",
    "the particles represent a coarse grained sampling of phase space which sets a mass and spatial resolution .",
    "unfortunately these super - massive particles will undergo two body encounters that lead to energy transfer as the system tends towards equipartition . in the real universe the dark matter particles are essentially collisionless and pass unperturbed past each other .",
    "the processes of relaxation is difficult to quantify , but in the large @xmath1 limit the discreteness effects inherent to the n - body technique vanish , so one tries to use as large a number of particles as computationally possible .",

    "these authors find that to resolve the central one per cent of a dark matter halo the entire system must contain of the order a million particles",
    ". it is not known what process sets this resolution scale since with one million particles relaxation is expected to be small , even at one per cent of the virial radius .",
    "unfortunately in most cosmological simulations the importance of two body interactions does not vanish if one increases @xmath1 .",
    "structure formation in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model occurs hierarchically since there is power on all scales , so the first objects that form in a simulation always contain only a few particles @xcite , @xcite . with higher resolution the first structures form earlier and have higher physical densities because they condense out of a denser environment .",
    "two body relaxation increases with density , so it is not clear if increasing the resolution can diminish the overall amount of two body relaxation in a cdm simulation , i.e. if testing for convergence by increasing the mass resolution is appropriate .    in isolated equilibrium systems relaxation rates",
    "can be measured from the energy dispersion .",
    "in cosmological simulations one can measure the amount of mass segregation of multi - mass simulations @xcite where lighter particles gain more energy from collisional processes than the heavier particles . in section [ estimate ]",
    "we present a fokker - planck type relaxation time estimate , which was fitted to a series of test simulations ( section [ equilibrium haloes ] ) where we explore the relaxation rates as a function of n , radius and softening parameter in both equilibrium and non - equilibrium cuspy haloes .",
    "we then use this local relaxation rate estimate to follow the relaxation history of each particle during 1000 time - steps of a hierarchical cdm simulation .",
    "the resulting degree of relaxation as a function of spatial position within galaxy and cluster mass haloes is analysed in section [ cosmo ] and in section [ discussion ] we discuss the effects that relaxation has on haloes at @xmath4 .",
    "in this paper we adopt the energy definition of the relaxation time @xcite stating that the mean relaxation time @xmath5 of a group of stars is the time after which the mean square energy change due to successive encounters equals the mean kinetic energy of the group : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the energy difference of one particle after time interval @xmath8 and the bar denotes the group average .    note",

    "the scattering calculation has to be done numerically and the results agree roughly with the newtonian case if one sets @xmath25 , i.e. one ignores all encounters with an impact parameter smaller than the softening length @xcite .",
    "we set @xmath26 because @xmath27 .",
    "the proper choice of @xmath16 is controversial , it is not clear whether it should be related to the size of the whole system or to the mean interparticle distance . for cosmological simulations we prefer the second choice @xmath28 because this is a local quantity that is easy to measure and less ambiguous than defining the size of irregular shaped , collapsing structures .",
    "we calculate the local velocity dispersion and density surrounding each particle by averaging over its @xmath29 nearest neighbours .",
    "we do a simple top - hat average , because using an sph spline kernel leads to biased results when using only @xmath29 particles .",
    "we found good agreement with all measured relaxation rates ( [ spherical ] ) when using @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "averaging over different numbers of nearest neighbours the optimal parameters differ slightly due to different amounts of numerical noise in the local density and velocity dispersion .",
    "in this section we present a number of test cases which we used to gauge our local estimate ( [ degree ] ) for the degree of relaxation and show that it agrees quite well ( within 15 per cent ) with measured levels of relaxation for a wide range of particle numbers , softening lengths and virial ratios .",
    "this range covers the haloes that form in cosmological simulations , however all the test cases are isotropic , spherical haloes .",
    "haloes in cosmological simulations are close to isotropic , but are triaxial and contain substructures .",
    "but one can argue that locally the two are similar , and if a local relaxation time estimate works in the spherical haloes , it should give a reasonable estimate also in the cosmological case .      in an equilibrium model",

    "all the simulations have been carried out using pkdgrav , a state of the art , multi - stepping , parallel tree - code @xcite .",
    "the time - steps are chosen proportional to the square root of the softening length over the acceleration on each particle , @xmath41 .",
    "we use @xmath42 , and a node - opening angle @xmath43 for all runs in this section , expect the long term integrations in subsection [ evolution ] where we use @xmath44 .",
    "energy conservation was better than 0.1 per cent after several crossing times for all runs in this section .",
    "due to softening the initial models are not exactly in equilibrium , the total kinetic energy is a few percent larger than half of the potential energy . for this reason we evolved the models for five",
    "crossing times before measuring the energy dispersion , which results in up to 10 per cent longer relaxation times .",
    "figure [ deltaevst.ps ] shows @xmath45 as a function of time within haloes constructed with @xmath46 and @xmath47 particles .",
    "the upper panel shows that for small numbers of particles @xmath48 @xmath7 becomes very noisy since there are fewer , but more significant encounters . to obtain more reliable results in small @xmath1 groups we added a sufficiently large number ( @xmath49 ) of massless tracer particles following the same distribution in real and velocity space as the massive particles .",
    "the open squares in figure [ deltaevst.ps ] show the energy dispersion of the tracers , which in large @xmath1 groups is just the same as the energy dispersion of the massive particles , but it evolves much smoother with time in small @xmath1 groups .",
    "we obtain the mean relaxation times ( [ t ] ) of these haloes with linear fits to the energy dispersion of the tracer particles ( open squares ) , taking into account points where @xmath50 , i.e. in the upper panel only the points left of the vertical bar , to make sure that @xmath8 is small compared to the relaxation time . the local relaxation estimate ( solid line ) ( [ le ] ) gives similar average degrees of relaxation in these test cases ( see also figures [ tvsn.ps ] and [ tvseps.ps ] ) .",
    "3.2 truein    note that the tracers are not in equilibrium with the halo , on average they gain speed in encounters and are ejected from the core . typically after one relaxation time the number of tracers inside of @xmath51 drops to one half of the initial number .",
    "therefore it is important to use a @xmath8 shorter than @xmath5 and to add the tracers after evolving the halo for five crossing times , otherwise the relaxation in the core is not sufficiently reflected in the energy dispersion of the tracers and @xmath5 could be underestimated significantly .",
    "figures [ tvsn.ps ] and [ tvseps.ps ] show the measured mean relaxation times as a function of @xmath1 and softening parameter , @xmath52 , compared with the average over all particles of the local relaxation estimate ( [ le ] ) .",
    "we find that the measured relaxation times are proportional to @xmath1 ( dashed reference line ) , rather than to @xmath53 ( dotted line ) , as expected for a softened potential .",
    "the same result was found for king models by @xcite .",
    "the local estimate of the relaxation time increases slightly faster with @xmath1 than the measured values .",
    "this is due to the fact that we choose a maximum impact parameter proportional to the mean interparticle separation , i.e. @xmath54 , but the difference is less than 10 per cent for all relaxation times shorter than a hubble time , i.e. for @xmath55 .",
    "the dependence on the softening length is shown in figure [ tvseps.ps ] for a @xmath56 model .",
    "the measured values ( filled squares ) increase faster with @xmath52 than the local estimate ( open squares ) ( like in figure 2 of @xcite ) , but the differences are small ( @xmath57 per cent ) for realistic softenings @xmath58 kpc .",
    "the average relaxation time of this model increases from 30 gyr to 180 gyr when the softening parameter is changed from 0.01 kpc to 1 kpc .",
    "this is slightly higher than expected from the scaling with @xmath59 since the density profile and central cusp are better resolved with smaller softening .",
    "3.2 truein    3.2 truein      measuring the relaxation time as a function of radius @xmath60 proved to be quite difficult .",
    "the most credible method seems to take ( [ t ] ) and replace the average over all particles by the average over those which are in the corresponding radial bin at the beginning ( or at the end ) of the time interval @xmath8 .",
    "clearly one has to choose @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the size of the bins , to make sure that most particles spend most of @xmath8 in the same bin .",
    "this could also be achieved by placing the tracers on circular orbits , which leads to very similar results for @xmath60 if @xmath63 , but in to the centre this method fails , because there the circular velocity is much smaller than the velocity dispersion ) than those of encounters between the massive particles ( @xmath64 ) . in non isothermal haloes ,",
    "@xmath65 and this leads to systematic errors in the measured relaxation times . in hernquist models @xmath66 holds only for @xmath67 , and indeed we found good agreement with the other methods only in this range . ] .    in figure ( [ rel.hernquist.ps ] )",
    "we plot the relaxation rate against radius for a hernquist model with @xmath49 particles .",
    "we measured the energy dispersion ( filled squares ) during @xmath68 gyr for each particle , and averaged the values of particles starting in the same radial bin .",
    "we also measured the local relaxation rate @xmath69 ( [ le ] ) at @xmath70 time - steps during @xmath8 for each particle and summed them up .",
    "the radial averages are plotted with open squares . again",
    "the agreement with the measured energy changes is better than 35 per cent except in the last three bins where the relaxation rates are many thousands of gyrs and the local relaxation measurement overestimates the true rate of relaxation . in the inner three bins the crossing times are shorter than @xmath71 gyr , i.e. many of the particles had time to move through these bins during @xmath72 gyr .",
    "the dashed line is the inverse of half the fokker - planck estimate ( [ fp ] ) with @xmath73 , calculated using all particles in the bin , not only from @xmath29 nearest neighbours .",
    "it scales like the phase space density @xmath74 which scales almost exactly like @xmath75 in a hernquist model .",
    "the local estimate also follows this @xmath75 scaling in the seven outer bins .",
    "the measured relaxation scales more like @xmath76 in the outer region , but the slope depends strongly on @xmath8 , i.e. on how many particles from the core with @xmath70 times higher relaxation rate have had time to reach the outer region .",
    "the average relaxation times ( [ fp ] ) is divergent for models with central cusps @xmath77 and steeper : @xmath78 . ]",
    "are about @xmath79 times shorter than measured relaxation times at half mass radius , due to the fast relaxation in the high density core of cuspy haloes . for a less concentrated king model ( @xmath80 )",
    "the fokker - planck estimate seems to agree not only with the measured relaxation time at half mass radius , but also with the mean relaxation time @xcite .",
    "3.2 truein      the definition of the relaxation time ( [ t ] ) is mostly used for systems close to dynamical equilibrium like globular clusters , i.e. systems with constant ( or only slowly changing ) mean kinetic energy . in this case",
    "the mean relaxation rate is also ( roughly ) constant and the degree of relaxation grows linear with time ( like in figure [ deltaevst.ps ] ) .",
    "generalising this definition to non - equilibrium situations is straightforward : the degree of relaxation of a group at some given time is the accumulated mean square energy change due to encounters divided by the mean square kinetic energy at this time .    now",
    "not all energy changes are due to encounters , so one needs another method to measure the degree of relaxation .",
    "again we use massless tracer particles like in the last section . instead of setting up their initial conditions exactly like those of the massive particles",
    ", one can also restrict the tracers to a common orbital plane . in a spherical system",
    "this does not change their density profile nor the relative velocities in encounters with the massive particles . if we choose the orbital plane of the tracers to be the @xmath81-plane , then the accumulated energy change due to encounters @xmath82 is @xmath83 as long as @xmath84 , i.e. for small degrees of relaxation .",
    "this relates the energy dispersion to a more demonstrative quantity and in the edge on view of the @xmath81-plane one can actually observe the relaxation process since the degree of relaxation is roughly proportional to the thickness of the disk . when the amount of relaxation approaches unity ( [ vz ] ) tends to underestimate the degree of relaxation , because tracers on new out of plane orbits will eventually reach a turnaround point where @xmath85 .",
    "also the probability that one tracer suffers more than one encounter grows with time , therefore one should place a new set of tracers into the plane to get an accurate relaxation rate as soon as the amount of relaxation is close to unity .    with ( [ vz ] ) we can measure the amount of relaxation in non - equilibrium situations , we only need one symmetry plane to be able to apply this method , therefore it allows us to measure the amount of relaxation during a collapse or a merger .      in cdm simulations",
    "the virial ratio @xmath86 is close to zero at the beginning of a halo collapse and grows towards unity as the halo reaches dynamical equilibrium . in the previous sections we showed that the local estimate ( [ le ] ) works for @xmath87 , but for @xmath88 the phase space density @xmath89 goes to infinity . down to",
    "which virial ratio can we trust our local estimate ?    to answer this question we began with equilibrium hernquist models ( same parameters as in section [ deponn ] ) with @xmath49 particles and multiplied all velocities with @xmath90 .",
    "therefore @xmath91 and the phase space density @xmath92 .",
    "to these models we added @xmath49 massless tracer particles with the same phase - space distribution and tilted their orbital planes into the @xmath81-plane .",
    "then we measure @xmath93 and the local estimate ( [ le ] ) at @xmath70 time - steps during the first @xmath94 gyr of the collapse .",
    "linear fits give the relaxation times plotted in figure ( [ tvsa.ps ] ) , the dashed line shows the scaling @xmath95 expected from the fokker - planck type estimates ( [ fp ] ) and ( [ le ] ) , since these times are proportional to one over phase - space density .",
    "our relaxation time estimate becomes very small when the virial ratio goes to zero , but the measured relaxation times remain on the order of a few dynamical times .",
    "@xmath96 is within a factor of two for @xmath97 and within 10 per cent for @xmath98 .",
    "also after the first @xmath94 gyr the local estimate follows the measured values , one example ( @xmath99 ) is plotted in the top panel of figure ( [ deltav.ps ] )",
    ".    3.2 truein    3.2 truein      the last test case for the local relaxation estimate is a merger of a small system into a more massive one .",
    "the problem in this case is that the small halo gains a lot of kinetic energy when falling into the main halo , so its accumulated energy changes due to encounters can become smaller _ relative _ to the mean kinetic energy of the group .",
    "a local estimate can never capture this decrease since it can not know about the gain in external kinetic energy . for",
    "a surviving subhalo one can argue that its accumulated energy changes should still be compared to its roughly constant internal kinetic energy to get an estimate of how affected it is by relaxation .",
    "but for haloes that are disrupted ( and stripped particles from subhaloes ) one has to worry about how their overestimated degrees of relaxation affect the average relaxation of the main halo .",
    "the bottom panel of figure ( [ deltav.ps ] ) shows how relaxation develops in a head on merger of a @xmath100 , @xmath101 kpc halo into a ten times more massive halo with @xmath46 and @xmath38 kpc .",
    "the initial separation was 100 kpc with a small relative velocity of @xmath102 km / s .",
    "the satellite falls in and reaches the centre of the main halo after 3 gyr .",
    "note how the relaxation of the satellite ( open squares ) _ decreases _ during infall , this can not be followed by the average local estimate ( [ le ] ) of the satellite ( dashed line ) , but still the average over the whole system ( solid line ) gives a good estimate for the mean degree of relaxation .",
    "we also verified this for equal mass mergers , there the decrease during infall is small because both haloes have quite large internal energies initially .",
    "the dynamical evolution of globular clusters is driven by relaxation , which can lead to core collapse and evaporation on a timescale of a few tens of half mass relaxation times , i.e. the core loses energy to an expanding outer envelope of stars and gets denser and hotter ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in the next section",
    "we show that haloes in cosmological simulations are typically between one and ten mean relaxation times old .",
    "( in terms of the much longer half mass relaxation time they are younger than one or two half mass relaxation times . )",
    "therefore we do not expect that density profiles in cosmological simulations are significantly affected by the core collapse process .",
    "studies of globular cluster evolution start with models that are isothermal in the centre ( e.g. plummer spheres , king models ) and then show a slow but monotonic density increase in the core .",
    "in contrast the cuspy haloes in cosmological simulations are not isothermal : the velocity dispersion decreases in the central regions . in this case relaxation",
    "leads to an energy flow inwards , the core evolves towards a less dense , isothermal state first .",
    "later the system evolves just like the models in globular cluster calculations @xcite .",
    "the n - body simulations of @xcite show this evolution starting from an nfw profile .",
    "we confirmed their result by evolving an @xmath103 hernquist model for @xmath104 crossing times ( see figure [ nvst.long.ps ] ) .",
    "3.2 truein    figure [ nvst.ps ] shows the evolution of five @xmath103 hernquist models during @xmath29 gyr , using a softening of @xmath105kpc . for this long term evolution",
    "we use a more conservative time step parameter @xmath106 , energy is conserved within 0.36 per cent even after @xmath104 crossing times .",
    "the crossing time at the half mass radius is @xmath107 gyr , the initial mean relaxation time is @xmath29 gyr and the initial half mass relaxation time is @xmath108 gyr .",
    "after @xmath109 gyr this halo is about three mean relaxation times old , a realistic value for haloes in current cosmological simulations , see section ( [ cosmo ] ) .",
    "the same would happen to a @xmath47 halo in only @xmath110 gyr , we use @xmath103 just to have a well defined density profile down to @xmath111 kpc .",
    "3.2 truein    3.2 truein    within few mean relaxation times the velocity dispersion rises in the centre and at the scale radius it drops slightly , in the end the core is already close to isothermal .",
    "this energy gain is compensated with core expansion , the inner two mass shells plotted in figure [ nvst.ps ] clearly lose mass .",
    "this is not a numerical artifact , the softening we used is much smaller than the inner bin and in a @xmath112 reference model the mass loss in the inner two bins is about ten times slower , i.e. this is really an effect driven by relaxation .",
    "the corresponding density profiles are less steep in the inner 3 per cent of the halo , see figure [ hernquist.pro.ps ] , and show constant density cores in this region .",

    "our results apply primarily to n - body , @xmath159 codes , such as direct or treecodes .",
    "adaptive grid based methods , such as art @xcite and mlapm @xcite also seem to suffer from relaxation but at slightly lower rates than from those quantified here @xcite .",
    "we show how one can define a local relaxation timescale for each particle by measuring its local phase space density which we applied to cosmological simulations in an attempt to determine the regions most affected by numerical relaxation .",
    "we summarise our results here :    1 .   the relaxation rates in cuspy dark matter haloes are in good agreement with the rates predicted by the orbit averaged fokker - planck equation .",
    "however the average relaxation time is an order of magnitude less than that measured at the half mass radius .",
    "we verify that the average relaxation time of a halo is proportional to the number of particles it contains and to the inverse natural logarithm of the softening parameter .",
    "the relaxation time is proportional to the local phase space density which allows us to measure the cumulative amount of relaxation each particle undergoes during the evolution of a halo .",
    "we show that we can measure the relaxation rate in collapsing or non - equilibrium haloes that have kinetic to potential energy ratios up to ten times smaller than the equilibrium value .",
    "averaging over several simulations of cuspy hernquist haloes we show that within few mean relaxation times the central cusp is transformed into a constant density core",
    "we show that the hierarchical build up of galaxy or cluster mass haloes leads to a greatly enhanced degree of relaxation within their central regions .",
    "the substructure haloes suffer from the highest rates of relaxation since they contain the fewest particles for the longest period of time .",
    "subhaloes are typically several relaxation times old therefore one should be cautious about interpreting their internal structure using simulations of order @xmath160 particles @xcite .",
    "cluster haloes suffer three times the amount of relaxation as galaxy haloes simulated at the same relative spatial and mass resolution .",
    "this is because the cluster forms later and more of its particles spend time in poorly resolved progenitors .",
    "increasing the resolution ( @xmath1 ) at a fixed force softening reduces the the accumulated amount of relaxation .",
    "the average degree of relaxation in cdm haloes at @xmath4 scales @xmath161 , in the inner 10 percent @xmath162 .",
    "relaxation may therefore provide a simple explanation for the slow convergence ( resolved radius @xmath163 ) in density profiles of cdm haloes simulated at different resolutions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "most of the affected particles become `` relaxed '' very early and within the first few gyrs of the evolution of the universe .",
    "this is hardest epoch to accurately resolve in a cosmological simulation since the relative force errors can be large and the densities of forming haloes can be very high .",
    "the high degrees relaxation show that at @xmath4 many particles have completely different energies and orbits compared to their evolution in the mean field limit ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "current cosmological simulations can not model all the subtle dynamics like orbital resonances which can be important e.g. during tidal stripping @xcite .",
    "but does relaxation also affect the coarse structure of the object , e.g. their density profiles ?",
    "it is unclear as to how one should interpret these results for the following reason .",
    "the highest rates of relaxation are accumulated early during the formation of the haloes .",
    "once a subhalo falls into a larger system the particles achieve a higher energy and it is not clear that one should accumulate the relaxation timescale in the way that we have done since the final `` hot '' system may lose the memory of the initial conditions through violent relaxation processes . indeed ,",
    "@xcite show that the initial conditions play little role in determine the final gross structure of dark matter haloes .",
    "the technique of accumulating the relaxation times by measuring the local phase density works very well for near equilibrium structures . in some instances , the energies of particles in a cosmological simulation will increase due to the mass increase from merging . from the virial theorem the growth in mass must be accompanied by an increase in velocity dispersion .",
    "thus it is not clear how relaxation at a high redshift propagates to the final time .",
    "however we are mainly interested in the structure of the central dark matter halo and the substructure haloes .",
    "these are the regions where most effort is going into comparing theoretical predictions with observational data ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion in the substructure haloes actually decreases slowly with time as mass is stripped . on the other hand the velocity dispersion of the central halo increases with time as it grows by merging .",
    "we can quantify the decrease in the mean velocity dispersion in subhaloes or the central halo region by extrapolating the particles backwards through time to examine the velocity dispersion in the progenitor haloes .",
    "for the galaxy cluster , half of the relaxation is accumulated since @xmath164 .",
    "we therefore trace all the particles in the central few percent of the cluster back to @xmath165 where we find that all the particles lie in the most massive collapsed haloes at that time  the most massive structures at high redshift form the central cluster region through natural biasing .",
    "we find that for the central cluster particles , @xmath166 , i.e. the mean dispersion only increases by 60% .",
    "similarly for cluster substructure haloes , the ratio is practically constant through time . for this reason we are confident that the accumulated degrees of relaxation are a good indicator of the true relaxation of the interesting regions within the simulations .",
    "we note that the following thought experiment illustrates a possible way in which relaxation in the first haloes can affect the central structure of the final halo , even though the energies of the particles may have changed over time : the first haloes to form are several relaxation times old and they achieve this in an near equilibrium state .",
    "we have demonstrated that our cumulative estimator works very well for non - equilibrium systems that have p.e./k.e .",
    "ratios as large as ten times the equilibrium mean ( figure 5 ) .",
    "we also show that these first poorly resolved haloes will develop constant density cores through relaxation ( figure 8) .",
    "now consider what happens when this halo accretes into a larger system .",
    "because of the constant density core the satellite will completely disrupt at some distance from the centre of the final object @xcite .",
    "if the accreting halo had a steep cusp resolved with more particles then it may sink deeper within the potential and deposit mass at smaller radii ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "thus the early relaxation could affect the final density profile even if the relative energies of the particles were initially quite different from their final energies .",
    "unfortunately , quantifying this effect and determining if it is at all important is best achieved by increasing the resolution by several orders of magnitude over the haloes simulated in this paper .",
    "we thank adrian jenkins and alexander knebe for helpful suggestions and comments .",
    "we also would like to thank the swiss supercomputing centre at manno for computing time where many of these numerical simulations were performed .",
