    "the evaluation of the accuracy of the cesium primary frequency standards requires to take into account , among others , the shift induced on the clock transition @xmath8 by the black body radiation ( bbr ) .",
    "the definition of the second in the international system of units ( si ) is in fact based on the above transition observed in absence of any perturbation and then , in particular , at @xmath9 k @xcite , where @xmath10 is the temperature of the environment .",
    "gallagher and cook @xcite firstly considered the effects of bbr on the rydberg states of the atoms while itano et al . @xcite focused their attention onto the atomic frequency standards .",
    "they reported the following expression for the relative frequency shift of the @xmath0cs clock transition ( @xmath11 hz ) : @xmath12\\ ] ]    with @xmath13 and @xmath14 when @xmath15 k. this expression has been adopted till now to correct all the primary frequency standards for the bbr shift at an accuracy level of @xmath16 or even better @xcite .",
    "the bbr induces both non resonant ac stark and zeeman shifts of the atomic transitions . for the ground state @xmath17 of the alkali - metal atoms the zeeman shift is of the order of @xmath18 @xcite and",
    "is not relevant for the accuracy estimation of the present frequency standards .",
    "the direct experimental method to evaluate the bbr shift is based on ( [ eq : itano ] ) : the frequency shift @xmath19 is measured versus the black body temperature _ t _ and the experimental points are fitted with ( [ eq : itano ] ) whose temperature dependence follows directly from the planck radiation law .",
    "this method has been used by bauch and schroeder @xcite employing a thermal cesium beam and in our group using an atomic fountain @xcite .    in order to increase the experimental resolution ,",
    "the bbr shift may be also evaluated indirectly by measuring the dc stark shift coefficient @xmath20 defined as : @xmath21 where @xmath19 is the frequency shift induced by the static electric field @xmath22 .",
    "measurements of @xmath20 have been performed in this way by haun and zacharias @xcite and by mowat @xcite , using a thermal beam and the ramsey interrogation technique , and by simon et al .",
    "@xcite using an atomic fountain .",
    "the bbr shift is then obtained from ( [ eq : kappa ] ) assuming _ e _ :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the mean - squared electric field of the black body radiation , @xmath25 is the stefan - boltzmann constant @xcite , @xmath26 is the vacuum permittivity and @xmath27 is the speed of light in vacuum . in ( [ eq : campoe ] ) the first identity",
    "is valid at a level of a few percent and can be corrected as reported in @xcite , while the second identity is obtained directly by the planck radiation law ( see next section ) .",
    "the measurement of the scalar static polarizability @xmath28 is related to the above method through the expression : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the potential energy of a neutral atom in a static electric field @xmath22 of moderate strength . due to the very low intensity of the black body field ,",
    "the hyperpolarizability effect is negligible @xcite and will not be considered throughout the paper .",
    "the polarizability is obtained from the force acting on the atom when submitted to a gradient of the electric field : @xmath31    this force , in turn , can be measured through the deflection of thermal beams @xcite , through e - h gradient balances @xcite or through the time of flight of cooled atoms in a fountain apparatus @xcite . in principle",
    ", the bbr shift can be also obtained from ( [ eq : campoe ] ) and ( [ eq : ploarizzability ] ) as follows : @xmath32\\langle\\mathcal{e}^{2}(t)\\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the cs case ; @xmath35 is the planck constant .",
    "the indirect experimental technique allows a higher resolution , being possible to submit the atoms to dc fields of several mv / m , if compared to the black body field @xmath36 v / m at _ t _ = 300 k used in the direct method .",
    "nevertheless , it is based on the conceptual assumption @xmath37 and may not be free from spurious effects as we shall discuss further on .",
    "> from the theoretical point of view , the evaluation of the bbr shift requires the computation of the scalar polarizabilities of the two states defining the clock transition or , in other words , of the non resonant ac stark shift .",
    "this is typically performed through perturbation techniques @xcite .",
    "more precisely , according to ( [ eq : shiftalfa ] ) , we have to calcolate the differential polarizability between the two ground state hyperfine levels . as pointed out by feichtner et al .",
    "@xcite , this requires to consider in the theoretical analysis a basis of modified eigenfunctions which account for the hyperfine interaction of the ground and @xmath38 states with other states of the same quantum numbers @xmath39 and @xmath40 . a review of the theoretical works leading to the evaluation of the ground state @xmath0cs polarizability can be found in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "due to the basic importance of the bbr shift correction to evaluate the present primary frequency standard accuracy at the @xmath16 level and , in the next future at the @xmath41 level , it is highly desirable to re - examine the relation ( [ eq : itano ] ) considering that :    * new and more precise experimental data are now available for the electric dipole moments and for the transition frequencies of @xmath0cs involved in the theoretical computation of @xmath28 ; * recent theoretical evaluations of @xmath28 @xcite lead to a significantly lower value than that commonly assumed up to now @xcite ; * the two most precise measurements @xcite of the electrical polarizability do not agree to each other .",
    "in this paper we report an ab - initio computation of the bbr shift for the clock transition which turns out lower by @xmath42 at 300 k than the commonly adopted value of ( [ eq : itano ] ) .",
    "a critical comparison with the theoretical and experimental values reported in the literature will be also given , showing the present difficulty to asses the accuracy at the @xmath41 level for atomic frequency standards operating at t @xmath43 k.",
    "the non - resonant ac stark shift @xmath44 of the energy of state @xmath45 induced by the level @xmath46 is given by @xcite : @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 the electron charge , @xmath50 the polarization vector of the electric field , @xmath51 the atomic position vector , @xmath52 and @xmath53 the energy levels of the states @xmath45 and @xmath46 in frequency units and @xmath54 the mean - squared value of the electric field at frequency @xmath55 .",
    "when @xmath45 represents a ground state , we have @xmath56 being @xmath57 and @xmath58 the frequency and the wavelength of the atomic transition @xmath59    the electric field per frequency unit @xmath60 is related to the spectral energy density @xmath61 by the well known relation : @xmath62 in our case the energy density @xmath63 is given by the planck radiation law : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the maximum of @xmath66 is reached when ( wien law ) : @xmath67 at _ t _ = 300 k , relation ( [ eq : wien ] ) gives @xmath68 thz . in the cs case",
    ", the minimum value of @xmath57 corresponds to the d@xmath69 optical transition ( 335 thz ) so that @xmath70 for all @xmath46 levels coupled to the state @xmath45 and it is possible to omit the @xmath71 term in the denominator of ( [ eq : acss ] ) avoiding the singularity of the integrand at @xmath72 .",
    "we shall consider further on the effect of this approximation .",
    "the basic relation ( [ eq : acss ] ) can then be written as : @xmath73 where the mean - squared electric field @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 the relation ( [ eq : campoenergy2 ] ) , obtained through ( [ eq : campoenergy ] ) and ( [ planck ] ) , is also known as the stefan - boltzmann law ; at _ _",
    "t__=300 k it gives @xmath76 ( v / m)@xmath77 , as already reported in the previous section .",
    "summing over all the excited states @xmath46 coupled to the level @xmath45 , we obtain the total stark shift for the state @xmath45 : @xmath78 moreover , taking ( [ eq : campoe ] ) and ( [ eq : ploarizzability ] ) into account , it is possible to write ( [ eq : acss3 ] ) also in the following form : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the scalar polarizability of the state @xmath45 which may be measured experimentally .    more precisely , the expression ( [ eq : alfa ] ) takes into account the contribution to the polarizability from the valence excited states . in principle , the total polarizability includes also the contribution from the core excited states @xcite ; however , this is not important for the clock transition shift since it is common to both the ground state sublevels .",
    "the bbr shift @xmath81 of the clock transition @xmath82 we are looking for is : @xmath83 introducing relations ( [ eq : campoenergy2 ] ) and ( [ eq : acss3 ] ) in ( [ deltanu ] ) we finally obtain : @xmath84 we conclude this theoretical review observing that the dc stark coefficient @xmath20 defined in ( [ eq : kappa ] ) can be expressed through the polarizabilities of the ground state levels ( see also ( [ eq : shiftalfa ] ) ) as : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the scalar differential polarizability introduced by sandars @xcite . in the experimental measurement of @xmath20",
    "performed with a dc electric field a tensorial component is also present , which has to be subtracted in order to take the isotropy of the black - body radiation into account @xcite .",
    "to evaluate numerically the bbr shift given by ( [ eq : deltanu2 ] ) we need the matrix elements of the operator @xmath87 ; writing the atomic position vector @xmath51 as an irreducible rank 1 tensor operator we have : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is expressed in terms of its spherical components @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 ; @xmath93 ( co - latitude ) and @xmath94 ( azimuth ) are the polar angles defining the electric field direction with respect to the quantization axis ( @xmath95 axis ) . the well - known wigner - eckart @xcite theorem allows us to simplify the generic matrix element : latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : wignereckart } \\langle\\ 6s_{1/2 } ; f , m_{f}| e r_{q } | n'p_{j ' } ; f ' , m'_{f } \\rangle\\ = q(f , m_{f } ; f ' , m'_{f } ; j , j ' ; q )   \\langle\\ 6s_{1/2 }    the dipole reduced matrix element and _ q _ is the index labelling the component of @xmath51 .",
    "in ( [ eq : wignereckart ] ) we defined : @xmath97 where the coefficients in round and in curly brackets are the 3-@xmath98 and 6-@xmath98 symbols respectively .",
    "the primed quantum numbers refer to the excited states @xmath99 coupled to the ground state by allowed electric dipole transitions .",
    "the polarizability of each of the two ground state levels can then be written as : @xmath100 in ( [ eq : integralone ] ) we perform an integration over the solid angle @xmath101 to take the isotropic nature of the bbr into account , consequently the integral is normalized to @xmath102 ; @xmath103 is the frequency of the transition indicated in parentheses . according to selection rules , for fixed values of the quantum numbers",
    "only one of the three @xmath104 terms is not zero .    actually , as feichtner et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out , the @xmath105 state and the @xmath38 states wave functions are perturbed by the effect of their hyperfine interaction with other states with the same @xmath39 and @xmath40 but with different principal quantum number @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , the dipole matrix elements should not be calculated between the unperturbed wave functions but between the perturbed ones defined as : @xmath107 the coefficients @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , given in @xcite , are here reported for convenience .",

    "these coefficients are very small ( of the order of @xmath112 ) and their contribution to the absolute value of the scalar polarizability is completely negligible .",

    "our final result for @xmath28 is then : @xmath116 where @xmath117 is given by ( [ eq : alfa0 ] ) and @xmath115 is reported in @xcite .    in table 6",

    "is compared with the experimental results reported in literature .",
    "our result agrees with the direct measured values while the indirect measurements , even if in agreement among them , are higher by three standard deviations .",

    "@xcite , @xmath123 is ref .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath124 is ref . @xcite . ]    * our theoretical result leads to a polarizability @xmath28 of the @xmath17 state in agreement with the most recent and precise evaluations as shown in table 6 , while the indirect measurements , considering that the stark effect is proportional to the polarizability at the first order , lead to a considerably higher value for @xmath28 ; * our computations lead to the result of itano et al .",
    "@xcite if we use the old values of the transition frequencies @xcite and of the electric dipole moments @xcite ; the latter , in particular , are considerably higher than the most precise recent values ; * our @xmath119 value agrees with the values obtained with the direct measurement method .    taking the above remarks into account ,",
    "the following hypothesis may be considered in order to explain this discrepancy :    * the assumption of equivalence between ac and dc stark shifts is not fully correct , in spite also of the correction term @xmath125 introduced by itano et al .",
    "@xcite ; * a systematic shift is present in the indirect measurements due to a physical effect not considered and present in the experiment .",
    "since we have no reason at the moment to believe in the breakdown of the equivalence between ac and dc stark shifts , as far as the second hypothesis is concerned , the following point should be examined .",
    "all the measurements performed with the indirect method are based on a ramsey interaction scheme with a stark field applied during the free flight of the atoms between the two interaction regions .",
    "the atoms experience then two sudden changes of the electric field which could perturb the free evolution of the hyperfine coherence or induce majorana - type transitions .",
    "the last hypotheses must be considered more a clue than a probe to explain the discrepancy under question and obviously requires a more complete theoretical treatment .",
    "we have reported in this paper a theoretical evaluation of the @xmath17 ground state polarizability of @xmath0cs and the bbr shift of the ground state hyperfine transition between the magnetic field independent sublevels .",
    "the former is in really good agreement with recent theoretical and experimental values ; the latter agrees with the direct measurements reported in the literature and is lower by three standard deviations than the values obtained from dc stark measurements .",
    "the discrepancy of @xmath126 at _ _",
    "t__=300 k between the more recent estimations and the value accepted up to now impacts the accuracy evaluation of the primary frequency standards at the level of two or three times their believed standard uncertainties .",
    "moreover , serious problems may be expected from the bbr shift to asses the accuracy at the level of @xmath127 for the future microwave frequency standards operating at @xmath128 k.",
    "to avoid the singularity at @xmath72 in section ii we have omitted the @xmath71 term in the denominator of ( [ eq : acss ] ) .",
    "this simplification , usually adopted in literature , is justified by the fact that near room temperature the energy content of the bbr is peaked at frequencies much lower than the lowest transition frequency of the atom .",
    "an estimation of the error due to this approximation is provided in @xcite with the introduction of the corrective term @xmath125 in ( [ eq : itano ] ) .",
    "here we re - evaluate this term following also the method described in @xcite .",
    "relations ( [ eq : acss ] ) , ( [ eq : campoenergy ] ) and ( [ planck ] ) give : @xmath129 where @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "expanding in ( [ eq : integral ] ) the factor : @xmath132 and integrating we obtain : @xmath133 being @xmath134 the bernoulli numbers .",
    "if we consider the main ( @xmath135 ) and the first order ( @xmath136 ) terms of ( [ eq : bernoulli ] ) and sum over all the valence states , we obtain : @xmath137      where @xmath139 the main term of ( [ deltanu3 ] ) coincides with ( [ eq : deltanu2 ] ) , as expected . as regards the corrective term @xmath125 , following the same procedure to evaluate the dipole matrix elements in the basis of modified eigenfunctions as reported in section iii ,",
    "we obtain @xmath140 , in agreement with the value reported in @xcite .",
    "this agreement is not surprising because the recent values of the the dipole moments affect significantly the main parameter @xmath119 , but much less the corrective term @xmath125 , as can be observed in ( [ eq : epsilon ] ) where they appear both in the numerator and in the denominator .",
