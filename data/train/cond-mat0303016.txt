    "the problem of magnetic impurities interacting with a system of strongly correlated electrons has attracted much interest recently , mainly due to the experimental discoveries of the high - t@xmath2 superconductors and new heavy fermion compounds . in the field of the high - t@xmath2 materials , the parent compounds are known to be two - dimensional ( 2d ) antiferromagnetic ( afm ) mott - hubbard insulators based on cuo@xmath3 planes which are driven to a superconducting state by doping ( e.g. with holes ) @xcite .",
    "even though the holes can hop , thus destroying the afm long - range order and causing the development of superconducting pairing , the extreme limit of static holes also has a physical relevance .",
    "systems with static holes have been also realized experimentally in cuprates @xcite    several theoretical studies have addressed isolated static holes @xcite and added spins @xcite in 2d heisenberg antiferromagnets with long range afm order . a singular logarithmic frequency behavior of the perpendicular magnetic susceptibility at zero temperature has been found in ref.@xcite , see also a discussion in ref.@xcite .",
    "a very interesting problem is a magnetic impurity in 2d heisenberg antiferromagnet at o(3 ) quantum critical point @xcite .",
    "however , this problem is out of the scope of the present paper .",
    "the low temperature behavior of the impurity static magnetic susceptibility in a gapped system is trivial , it obeys the simple curie low , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the impurity spin .",
    "however , for 2d systems which possess the long range afm order at zero temperature , the excitation spectrum is gapless due to goldstone spin waves and the curie low is not obvious",
    ". a very interesting prediction @xcite for such a regime is the classical curie low , @xmath6 .",
    "the behaviour is classical because of alignment of the impurity moment with the local neel order .",
    "this behaviour has been recently confirmed in monte carlo simulations for 2d @xmath7 heisenberg antiferromagnetic clusters with magnetic impurity @xcite .",
    "moreover , in these simulations a logarithmic correction , @xmath1 , to the classical curie low has been found .",
    "both the classical curie low and the logarithmic correction are related to the nontrivial long - range dynamics in the system . in the present work",
    "we calculate the logarithmic correction using two different methods , a ) spin - wave perturbation theory , b ) semiclassical non - linear @xmath8-model . in the leading @xmath9 approximation",
    "both methods give the same result .",
    "however the results must be identical in all orders in @xmath9 and hence the comparison allows us to derive the ward identity for the impurity - spin - wave vertex .",
    "value of the logarithmic correction to the magnetic susceptibility is in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite .    a crossover from quantum to classical curie low for a finite afm cluster with impurity",
    "is discussed in section ii . in section",
    "iii we derive the impurity susceptibility using the spin - wave perturbation theory , and in section iv we obtain the same result using the semiclassical non - linear @xmath8-model and derive the ward identity .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system under consideration is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is spin 1/2 at the site @xmath12 of square lattice with antiferromagnetic interaction ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 is the impurity spin coupled to the lattice spin at site @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is magnetic field . to be specific",
    "we will assume that @xmath17 , but all results are in the end independent of sign of @xmath18 .",
    "consider an @xmath19 cluster ( @xmath20 is even ) described by the hamiltonian @xmath21 , so no impurities for the beginning .",
    "energy spectrum of the system is known very well @xcite .",
    "spin of the ground state is 0 , and lowest excitations are described by rotational spectrum of the solid top ( diatomic molecule with zero projection of spin on axis of the molecule .",
    "@xmath22 ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 is spin of the state ( @xmath25 corresponds to the ground state ) , @xmath26 is moment of inertia of the top , and @xmath27 is perpendicular magnetic susceptibility @xcite .",
    "the spectrum ( [ s0 ] ) is valid as soon as the rotation is solid , i.e. internal degrees of freedom of the top are not excited .",
    "the first internal excitation is the spin wave with wave length @xmath28 ( periodic boundary condition ) .",
    "energy of this excitation is @xmath29 there are 8 degenerate spin - wave excitations : @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 directions , and two excitations ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) in each direction .",
    "if we consider @xmath35 then only rotations ( [ s0 ] ) are important .",
    "a more accurate criterion for solid rotation is : @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath37 in this temperature regime magnetic susceptibility of the cluster is determined by the spectrum ( [ s0 ] ) .",
    "@xmath38 where summation over @xmath39 is performed from @xmath15 to @xmath40 . if @xmath41 the susceptibility is zero , and if @xmath42 the evaluation of ( [ ms0 ] ) gives @xmath43 the expansion is in integer powers of @xmath44 .",
    "now let us put an impurity with spin @xmath14 which interacts with cluster via @xmath45 , see eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) .",
    "excitation spectrum of the cluster with impurity is slightly different from ( [ s0 ] ) .",
    "now this is a symmetric top with spin projection on axis of the top @xmath46 .",
    "this is like a diatomic molecule with uncompensated electron spin and strong spin - axis interaction .",
    "rotational spectrum of such top is @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is total spin of the cluster , and @xmath49 is the average value of @xmath50 in the intrinsic reference frame .",
    "similar to the previous case the spin waves are not excited as soon as the inequality ( [ tsw ] ) is valid .",
    "one can easily check that in this case the magnetic susceptibility of the cluster @xmath51 is given by the same eq .",
    "( [ ms0 ] ) , the only difference is that summation over @xmath39 is performed not from @xmath15 to @xmath40 , but from @xmath5 to @xmath40 . if @xmath52 the cluster susceptibility is @xmath53 . if @xmath54 evaluation of ( [ ms0 ] ) gives",
    "@xmath55 hence the impurity susceptibility defined as @xmath56 reads @xmath57 the expansion goes in integer powers of @xmath44 .",
    "the leading term in ( [ imp ] ) agrees with @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that if there are n impurities with spin @xmath5 on the same sublattice than in eq .",
    "( [ imp ] ) one shall replace @xmath58 .",
    "the impurities are not independent because the cluster is rigid . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "it means that all the impurities within the correlation length are not independent .",
    "the above consideration is valid for the case when the inequality ( [ tsw ] ) is valid and hence there are no _ real _ spin - wave excitations .",
    "however virtual spin - wave excitations are always there . in the intrinsic reference frame",
    "the cluster looks like picture in fig.1        the interaction hamiltonian @xmath45 , eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) , can be rewritten in terms of spin - wave operators @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( for review of the spin - wave theory see , e. g. ref .",

    "we assume that @xmath7 . in eq .",
    "( [ hint1 ] ) the impurity - spin - wave vertex is derived in the leading @xmath9 approximation . however , at the last step we have introduced the vertex renormalization factor @xmath68 that takes into account all higher @xmath9 corrections to the vertex . generally speaking @xmath68 depends on @xmath69 , but here we consider only the small @xmath69 limit , @xmath70 .    to use perturbation theory",
    "we will assume that @xmath71 .",
    "one loop correction to the impurity energy is given by diagram in fig.2 .",
    "the diagram is infrared convergent because it contains the denominator , @xmath72 , related to the flip of the impurity spin . here",
    "@xmath73 is staggered magnetization of the lattice , and @xmath74 is the renormalization factor for the staggered magnetization @xcite .",
    "interaction of the impurity with perpendicular magnetic field is of the form @xmath75 the leading contribution to the impurity energy related to @xmath76 is given by diagram in fig.3 .",
    "corresponding formula reads @xmath77 the contribution is finite because @xmath78 is finite .",
    "now let us look at one loop corrections to @xmath79 shown in fig.4 .",
    "these corrections are infrared divergent because they contain the energy denominator without spin flip , @xmath80 . using usual schroedinger perturbation theory",
    "one finds the corresponding energy correction @xmath81 here @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the spin - wave velocity renormalization due to higher @xmath9 corrections @xcite .",
    "keeping only divergent terms we find from ( [ loop1 ] ) the following expression for the susceptibility @xmath84 it is interesting that ( [ loop1 ] ) is independent of @xmath18 .",
    "we have to put some lower limit in the integral in ( [ loop1c ] ) . at low temperature , when inequality ( [ tsw ] ) is valid , we have to substitute the spin - wave gap ( [ esw ] ) as the lower limit .",
    "this gives temperature independent contribution to the impurity susceptibility @xmath85 if @xmath86 one has to put temperature as the lower limit in ( [ loop1c ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath87 in the leading @xmath9 approximation one has to set @xmath88 , hence @xmath89 .",
    "this corresponds to the low - frequency susceptibility derived in ref .",
    "we have calculated the perpendicular susceptibility ( [ l1c ] ) , ( [ l1ct ] ) in the intrinsic reference frame .",
    "the isotropic susceptibility is related to @xmath90 by the standard relation , @xmath91 .",
    "an alternative derivation of ( [ l1c ] ) and ( [ l1ct ] ) is based on the @xmath8-model .",
    "let us consider a field @xmath92 , @xmath93 , defined on a disc of radius @xmath94 .",
    "an impurity with spin @xmath5 is in the center of the disc .    .",
    "the disc carries fild @xmath95 described by the nonlinear @xmath8-model . due to magnetic field @xmath96 the impurity spin",
    "is tilted in x - direction _ _ ]    the impurity spin is directed along z axis ( perpendicular to the plane ) and due to the magnetic field @xmath96 it is tilted by angle @xmath97 is x - direction , see fig .",
    "energy of the medium is @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the spin stiffness . here",
    "@xmath100 is the leading @xmath9 value for the stiffness , and @xmath101 is the renormalization factor due to higher @xmath9-corrections @xcite .",
    "the field is of the form @xmath102 . due to",
    "( [ sigma ] ) the field @xmath103 obeys the usual poisson equation , solution of the equation is @xmath104 to find the constant @xmath59 we have to remember that @xmath105 , where @xmath97 is tilting angle of the impurity , and @xmath106",
    ". therefore @xmath107 . substituting ( [ lapl ] ) in ( [ sigma ] )",
    "we find the elastic energy @xmath108 .",
    "total energy related to the impurity consists of the magnetic energy and the elastic energy @xmath109 minimizing it with respect to @xmath97 we find @xmath110 , magnetic moment @xmath111 , and the magnetic susceptibility @xmath112 at the final step we have substituted @xmath113 . in the leading @xmath9 approximation , @xmath114 , hence equation ( [ s2 ] ) agrees with the spin - wave results ( [ l1c ] ) and ( [ l1ct ] ) .",
    "moreover a comparison of these equations gives a nontrivial ward identity relating renormalization factors for the spin - wave vertex @xmath68 , the spin - wave velocity @xmath115 , the staggered magnetization @xmath116 , and the spin stiffness @xmath117 @xmath118 this gives previously unknown value of @xmath68 @xmath119 similar to ( [ l1ct ] ) one has to substitute @xmath120 instead of @xmath121 in ( [ s2 ] ) if @xmath122 . if the external magnetic field has a nonzero frequency @xmath123 , and @xmath124 , then @xmath125 .",
    "equations ( [ l1c ] ) , ( [ l1ct ] ) , and ( [ s2 ] ) are in agreement with ref . @xcite and with recent results @xcite .",
    "the spin - wave approach in section iii assumes that @xmath71 .",
    "there are numerous two - loop diagrams which are proportional to @xmath126 and even to @xmath127 .",
    "some of the diagrams which contain the logarithm squared are shown in fig .",
    "calculation of all the diagrams is a pretty involved problem .",
    "proportional to @xmath128 _ _ ]    on the other hand the semiclassical derivation based on the @xmath8-model is independent of @xmath129 .",
    "the only assumption in the derivation is that the impurity magnetic moment is localized in the vicinity of the impurity . to check this assumption",
    "we have calculated the magnetic cloud around the impurity using the spin - wave theory .",
    "we have found that density of the induced magnetization @xmath130 drops down faster than @xmath131 , @xmath132 .",
    "therefore , the magnetic moment of the cloud @xmath133 is convergent at large distances , and it means that the above assumption is valid .",
    "this implies that _ all _ higher order in @xmath18 infrared divergent diagrams must cancel out .",
    "this is a highly unusual situation and it would be interesting to check the cancellation by a direct calculation .",
    "we have analyzed excitation spectrum of a finite antiferromagnetic cluster with magnetic impurity , and considered a crossover between quantum and classical curie law for the impurity magnetic susceptibility .",
    "we have also derived a logarithmic correction to the impurity magnetic susceptibility .",
    "dependent on the parameters this can be logarithm of system size , temperature , or frequency of the external magnetic field . using the results for the logarithmic correction we have derived the ward identity for the impurity - spin - wave vertex .",
