    "the microscopic understanding of this phase separation is , however , complicated due to the strong interaction which masks or , at least , competes with the quantum statistical effects @xcite .",
    "general arguments based on fermi - liquid theory indicated the importance of mediated interactions @xcite ; they are the modification of the inter - particle interactions in one liquid due to the presence of the second liquid and directly causes the phase separation by destroying the stability of the homogeneous state . in the static limit , applicable to the description of the helium mixtures in which the sound velocity @xmath4 of the boson superfluid greatly exceeds the fermi velocity @xmath5 , the boson - mediated fermion - fermion interactions are attractive and can cooper - pair the fermions @xcite . from the experimental measurements in helium mixtures",

    "the realization of s - wave cooper - pairing in fermion - bec mixtures , will , however , require much experimental skill .",
    "this pairing scheme requires the simultaneous trapping of fermion atoms in two distinct hyperfine states at nearly equal densities , a considerable challenge in the presence of a bec : a dependence of the boson - fermion interactions on the fermion spin introduces a difference in the local spin densities even if the total number of fermion atoms is evenly divided over the two spin states and both spins experience identical trapping potentials .    in this paper , we focus on a dilute mixture of bec and one - component fermi gas that remains normal .",

    "we analyze the homogeneous bec  fermion mixture using the semi - classical description , and obtain a single self - consistent fermi - liquid - like collective mode equation .",
    "the semiclassical description in terms of the spatially oscillating deformation of the local fermi - surface elucidates the zero - sound nature of the fermion oscillations in both modes , revealing that the dominant decay mechanism of the bec - like sound mode at long wavelengths is landau damping .",
    "the dispersion relations of the two collective modes , the undamped and damped modes , avoid crossing each other in the wavenumber interval where the undamped mode gradually changes its character from a pure fermi - liquid zero sound mode to a bogoliubov excitation of the bec .",
    "the damped mode terminates at a certain wavelength .",

    "since the damped mode can be viewed as an elementary bec - excitation that has been modified by the fermion - mediated boson - boson interactions , the decay can also occur by belyaev damping where pairs of boson quasi - particles are created @xcite .",
    "while our treatment does not describe this damping , the decay rate due to belyaev damping tends to be slow in the long wavelength limit @xmath201 , @xmath202 , thus can be neglected in the range of @xmath128 of our interest .",
    "finally , it is instructive to express @xmath125 as a function of the velocity ratio , @xmath131 , in the limit @xmath203 ( see fig .  [",

    "equation  ( [ eq : instability dispersion ] ) also provides insight into the dynamics of the onset ( the early stages ) of the phase separation instability .",
    "consider an experiment that brings @xmath223 in a fermion - bec mixture to above @xmath224 by an abrupt change of @xmath17 ( [ eq : rhocrit ] ) . in response ,",
    "the amplitude of the longest wavelength modes of the damped zero - sound excitations grow exponentially at a rate @xmath225 nucleating spatial regions of pure fermion matter when the dynamics becomes non - linear . those modes that grow fastest ( with wavenumber @xmath226 )",

    "in this section , we mention relevant atom trap techniques and estimate magnitudes of quantities to gauge the feasibility of experimentally observing the collective mode physics .",
    "the important parameter for the boson - boson interactions in a dilute bec is the dimensionless gas parameter , @xmath232 @xcite .",
    "we find it useful to express the density in units of a reference density @xmath233 that corresponds to the lower range obtained in atom traps , @xmath234 .",
    "then , the gas parameter is @xmath235 we introduce the atomic mass number of the bosonic and fermionic isotopes , @xmath236 and @xmath237 ( @xmath238 for @xmath239li , for instance ) and express @xmath240 and fermi - energies @xmath241 as @xmath242 the time scale for the fermion dynamics is equal to @xmath243 from which it follows that the fermi velocity can be of the order of several cm / sec , @xmath244 most importantly , the velocity ratio @xmath131 which quantifies the ratio of the relevant fermion to boson time scales and which determines the validity of the static approximation of the bec - mediated interaction , can be written as @xmath245 clearly experiments can access both the @xmath246 and @xmath185 regimes .",
    "for example , @xmath239li with @xmath247 immersed in @xmath248na bec with @xmath249 and @xmath250 gives @xmath251 , whereas changing the density of the bec to @xmath252 increase the velocity ratio to @xmath253 .",
    "to observe the predicted collective modes an experimentalist could measure the group velocities in a fermion - boson mixture that is contained in a cigar shaped trap .",
    "we assume that the transverse confinement is not so tight as to bring the system into the regime where it becomes effectively one - dimensional .",

    "two wavepackets of different densities propagate outward with different group velocities . the density variations ( fermion and boson )",
    "can be imaged directly , as in the first observation of the bec - sound mode @xcite .",
    "the slower wavepacket would correspond to the landau damped mode with @xmath254 which can be slow enough to observe significant propagation while sufficiently fast to measure damping before the wavepacket reaches equilibrium densities that are significantly different from trap middle .    in more sophisticated experiments",
    ", the initial perturbation can be controlled , and an analysis of the time evolution of the shape of the propagating wavepackets can be used to infer the dispersion relations and damping rates . in the past ,",
    "the greatest control was achieved by accessing a two - photon resonance to cause low intensity bragg scattering .",
    "in such an experiment the momentum of the excitation can be varied by changing the angle of the crossed laser beams .",
    "the laser beams need to be focused near the middle of the trap to probe the nearly uniform region of the fermion - boson mixture .",
    "similar techniques have been used in bogoliubov spectroscopy experiments @xcite .",
    "finally , we remark that by tuning the boson - boson scattering length close to its zero - point @xmath255 , thereby lowers the critical fermion density can always trigger the phase separation phenomenon . by triggering the phase separation in a cigar shaped trap , the surface tension can prevent the single phase domains to move past each other , the experimenter can obtain a string of single phase ` droplets ' .",
    "the size of these domains reflect the dominant mode wave vector .",
    "such experimental study was demonstrated in the phase separation of multi - component bec s @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed the collective modes of a single component fermion ",
    "bec mixture in ultra - low temperature where the fermions behave as normal fermi - liquid .",
    "if @xmath256 and @xmath130 , the homogeneous mixture is mechanically stable and two collective modes with zero - sound character exist .",
    "one is an undamped mode that resembles the zero - sound mode of a pure fermi - liquid system .",
    "the dispersion of this mode is linear with phase velocity @xmath257 in the long wavelength limit and then merges into the bogoliubov dispersion of an elementary bec excitation near @xmath258 .",
    "the other mode resembles the sound mode of a pure bec system in the long wavelength limit .",
    "the mode undergoes landau damping and decays at the rate @xmath259 .",
    "the dispersion of this mode terminates at a well - defined wavenumber @xmath189 . in the long wavelength limit , the rate for landau damping can be approximated using the fermi - golden rule and is @xmath260 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath261 and @xmath130 , the bec response is sufficiently fast to follow the fermion oscillations adiabatically , thus the dispersion is the bogoliubov dispersion for all @xmath128 .",
    "when @xmath217 , we have @xmath262 the homogenous mixture is unstable and undergoes phase separation by forming clusters of pure fermions .",
    "our analysis shows that the growth rate is @xmath263  and the average cluster size is @xmath231 .    finally , our discussion of current atom trap technology and relevant observables indicate that the collective modes can be observed and the dispersions and damping rates may be measured .",
