    "topologically non - trivial structures have been intensively studied in many areas of physics @xcite . in particular , in the context of classical field theories , these structures are described as finite - energy solutions to some non - linear models . in this case ,",
    "such models must be endowed by a spontaneous symmetry breaking potential for the matter self - interaction , since topological solutions are formed during symmetry breaking phase transitions .    in this context , the most common topological defects are kinks @xcite , vortices @xcite and magnetic monopoles @xcite : the first ones are one - dimensional structures described by a single real scalar field , while vortices and monopoles are two- and three - dimensional configurations arising as static solutions of some abelian- and a non - abelian - higgs models .",
    "in particular , vortices are stable configurations described by radially symmetric profile .",
    "the simplest version of such structures arises as electrically non - charged solution of a planar maxwell - higgs model endowed by a fourth - order higgs potential .",
    "however , under special circumstances , vortices also arise as electrically charged configurations of some chern - simons- and maxwell - chern - simons - higgs ( mcs - higgs ) models @xcite . in all these cases , such structures can be found as numerical solutions to a set of first - order differential equations , named bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) ones @xcite .  in this case , as finite - energy solutions , they have interesting applications , mainly concerning the superconductivity phenomena @xcite .    moreover , during the last years , beyond the standard models cited above , non - usual ones have been intensively studied .",
    "these theories , generically named _",
    "k - field models _ , are endowed by non - usual kinetic terms , which change the dynamics of the overall model in a non - standard way . here , it is important to point out that the motivation regarding such generalization arises in a rather natural way , in the context of string theories .",
    "in fact , k - field theories have been used as effective models mainly in cosmology , as an attempt to explain the actual accelerated inflationary phase of the universe @xcite via the so - called k - essence models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they have been applied in the study of strong gravitational waves @xcite , dark- @xcite and tachyon - matter @xcite , and others @xcite .",
    "in such a non - standard scenario , topologically non - trivial configurations , named _",
    "topological k - solutions _ , can exist even in the absence of a symmetry breaking potential @xcite , from which one notes that the existence of such structures are quite sensible to the presence of non - standard kinetic terms . on the other hand , as an attempt to study topological k - solutions via the comparison between them and their canonical counterparts , some of us have already considered the existence of such solutions in the context of symmetry breaking k - field models @xcite . moreover , interesting results concerning these models and the corresponding solutions can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "in general , given non - trivial kinetic terms , k - field models can be highly non - linear , and the corresponding k - solutions can be quite hard to find . in this case , the development of a consistent self - dual theoretical framework is quite useful and desirable , since it helps to find topological k - structures as solutions to some non - standard bps equations . here , as in the usual approach , such equations can be obtained via the minimization of the energy functional related to the non - standard model , the resulting self - dual k - solutions being the minimal energy configurations possible ever .    in this sense , in a recent work , some of us have presented a bps theoretical framework consistent with a generalized self - dual maxwell - higgs model endowed by non - usual kinetic terms to both gauge and scalar fields n14d .",
    "now , we introduce an extension of that work . here",
    ", we develop a general first - order approach consistent with a non - standard self - dual mcs - higgs model . the overall model , including its self - dual potential , depends on three different functions , @xmath4 , @xmath1 and @xmath5 , which are functions of the scalar sector of the model . in this context , we look for topologically non - trivial configurations via the usual radially symmetric static _ ansatz _ , and the finite - energy generalized numerical solutions we found behave in the same general way as their standard counterparts , as expected .",
    "this letter is outlined as follows : in the next sec.[general ] , we introduce the generalized model and develop the bps  framework which allows us to get to its non - standard bps equations . also , we verify the consistence of the overall construction by using it to develop a generalization of the usual mcs - higgs case , the general model being controlled by two real parameters , @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    ". then , in section [ numerical2 ] , we perform the numerical analysis concerning the non - standard bps  equations previously presented by means of the relaxation technique . also , we depict the corresponding self - dual k - solutions for the electromagnetic sector and comment on the main features they engender . finally , in sec.[end ]",
    ", we present our ending comments and perspectives .    from now on ,",
    "we use the natural units system and a plus - minus signature for the planar minkowski metric .",
    "the planar lagrangian density describing the generalized maxwell - chern - simons - higgs model is given by@xmath8where @xmath9is the usual electromagnetic field strength tensor , @xmath10 is the covariant derivative of the higgs field and @xmath11 is the @xmath12dimensional levi - civita s tensor ( with @xmath13 ) .",
    "the additional real scalar field @xmath14  provides the stabilization of the self - dual solutions arising in the presence of both maxwell and chern - simons terms . here ,",
    "@xmath15  and @xmath16  are positive - definite dimensionless functions of the scalar fields of the model .",
    "the higgs potential @xmath17  supporting spontaneous symmetry breaking is supposed to have the following structure@xmath18from which one notes that @xmath19 is defined in terms of @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath3 , with @xmath22 .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that the specific form of the potential in ( [ p ] ) assures the self - duality of the generalized model ( [ m ] ) , i.e. , it is a consequence of the bps construction and can be derived from the energy density ( [ xx ] ) .",
    "we introduce the mass scale @xmath23 of the model , and use it to perform the scale transformations : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field .",
    "then , we get that @xmath32 and @xmath33@xmath34 , and the modified model ( m ) is now described by the dimensionless lagrange density @xmath34 , which  has the same form as @xmath35 . also , for simplicity , we choose @xmath36 .",
    "it is well - known that chern - simons  theories only exhibit electrically charged static solutions .",
    "in fact , the static gauss law related to ( [ m ] ) is ( @xmath37 runs over spatial indices only)@xmath38from which one  observes that , even in the presence of non - trivial @xmath15 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the absence of electrically uncharged static solutions still holds , since the temporal gauge @xmath41 does not solve ( [ gl ] ) .",
    "now , since the gauge @xmath42  can not be implemented and supposing that @xmath20 * , * @xmath43  and @xmath3  are non - trivial functions , the looking for static solutions for the second - order euler - lagrange equations related to ( [ m ] ) can be a quite hard task , even in the presence of suitable boundary conditions .  in this context ,",
    "the adequate implementation of the bps formalism is quite useful , since it helps to find finite energy configurations as solutions of a given set of first - order differential equations .",
    "so , from now on , we focus our attention on the development of a bps framework consistent with ( [ m ] ) and ( [ p ] ) . specifically , we look for radially symmetric solutions using the standard static _ _",
    "ansatz__@xmath44@xmath45where @xmath46 are polar coordinates and @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 ... is the winding number ( vorticity ) of the configuration .",
    "the fields @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 must obey the usual boundary conditions@xmath53@xmath54where prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath55 .    now",
    ", we implement the bogomolnyi approach on the energy functional related to ( [ m ] ) .",
    "given the generalized potential ( [ p ] ) , the radially symmetric non - standard energy density can be written as@xmath56where @xmath57 * , * @xmath58  and @xmath59 .",
    "it is clear that , in order to guarantee a positive - definite energy , both @xmath60  and @xmath61 must be positive - definite and finite .",
    "now , by using the static gauss law ( [ gl ] ) together with the constraint @xmath62the energy density ( [ ge ] ) can be rewritten in the form@xmath63    at this point , we see that the resulting total energy is minimized by the non - standard first - order equations@xmath64@xmath65equations ( [ xx1 ] ) and ( [ xx2 ] ) are the bps equations related to the generalized mcs - higgs model ( [ m ] ) . in the present case , the bps total energy @xmath66 related to the solutions of ( [ xx1 ] ) and ( [ xx2 ] ) can be explicitly evaluated@xmath67where the minimal energy density @xmath68 is defined as@xmath69also , to compute the bps energy ( [ xx3 ] ) , we have used the boundary conditions ( [ q1 ] ) and ( [ q2 ] ) together with@xmath70finally , we assume that @xmath20 and @xmath1 behave as@xmath71@xmath72where @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are real non - negative constants , and @xmath76 is a real positive constant .    from ( [ xx3 ] ) ,",
    "one notes that the total energy @xmath66 is quantized according the winding number @xmath77 .",
    "furthermore , it can be related to the magnetic flux @xmath78 in the standard way .",
    "also , we point out that the first - order framework developed here is implemented for any function @xmath15 finite and positive - definite , i.e. , given some function @xmath0 , the set formed by ( [ xx1 ] ) and ( [ xx2 ] ) gives the bps configurations of the generalized mcs - higgs model ( [ m ] ) . on the other hand , in the absence of ( [ p ] ) or ( [ dc ] ) , the energy functional ( [ ge ] ) can not be written as ( [ xx ] ) , and the development of a consistent non - standard first - order formalism can not be performed .",
    "the prescription for the development of generalized self - dual maxwell - chern - simons - higgs models is as follows : given any function @xmath21 , positive and finite , the corresponding @xmath40  is obtained by means of eq .",
    "( [ dc ] ) .",
    "then , given any function @xmath79 , also positive and finite , the resulting self - dual potential @xmath80  is determined via ( [ p ] ) . in this scenario , the bps states of the generalized model ( [ m ] )",
    "are the solutions of the equations ( [ gl ] ) , ( [ xx1 ] ) and ( [ xx2 ] ) .",
    "the total energy is given by ( [ xx3 ] ) , and the energy density by ( xx4 ) .",
    "in the standard mcs - higgs case , bps solutions with non - trivial topology only exist in the asymmetric vacuum of the potential@xmath81which is defined by @xmath82  and @xmath83 .",
    "so , for simplicity , we assume that also the generalized potential ( [ p ] ) achieves its asymmetric vacuum when @xmath82  and @xmath84 . as a consequence , topologically",
    "non - trivial self - dual solutions of ( [ m ] ) exist in the same asymmetric phase as their standard counterparts .",
    "the standard mcs - higgs model is trivially recovered starting from our generalized framework by setting @xmath85 .",
    "so , instead of recovering the usual model , we introduce a generalization of such theory .",
    "the generalized model is defined by@xmath86where @xmath7 is a positive odd- number . the corresponding @xmath87 is@xmath88for simplicity , we choose @xmath20 as follows@xmath89where @xmath6 is a real non - negative number .",
    "note that @xmath90 and @xmath91 leads us back to the standard case .",
    "the resulting generalized self - dual potential @xmath19 ( [ p ] ) is@xmath92 in the present case , ( [ gl ] ) , ( [ xx1 ] ) and ( [ xx2 ] ) can be written , respectively , as@xmath93@xmath94@xmath95which must be solved according the finite energy boundary conditions and ( [ q2 ] ) .    in the next section ,",
    "we solve , and via and ( [ q2 ] ) for different values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "then , we use the numerical solutions we found for @xmath50 , @xmath96 and @xmath52 to depict the corresponding profiles for the electric field@xmath97the magnetic field@xmath98and the minimal energy density ( [ xx4 ] ) .",
    "also , we comment on the main features the non - standard numerical solutions engender .",
    "in this section , we focus our attention on the non - standard numerical solutions themselves .",
    "the equations to be studied are , and , and the fields @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath99 must behave according the finite energy boundary conditions and ( [ q2 ] ) .    here , for simplicity , we choose @xmath100 .",
    "then , we solve the first - order system numerically by means of the relaxation technique , for different values of the real parameters @xmath6  and @xmath7 .",
    "the profiles of the physical fields and energy density  are depicted in the figures below .",
    "the system was solved for @xmath90 and @xmath101 ( usual case , dash - dotted black line ) , @xmath90 and @xmath102 ( dotted blue line ) , @xmath103 and @xmath101 ( dashed red line ) and @xmath103 and @xmath102 ( solid green line ) .     for @xmath104 and @xmath101 ( dash - dotted black line ) , @xmath104 and @xmath102 ( dotted blue line ) , @xmath105 and @xmath101 ( dashed red line ) and @xmath106 and @xmath107 ( solid green line).,width=321 ]    in figure 1 , we depict the numerical solutions for the electric field , and we see that the non - standard ones behave , in general , as their usual counterpart : starting from @xmath108 ( zero ) , the solutions reach their maximum values at some finite distance @xmath109 from the origin , and vanish as @xmath55 goes to infinity .",
    "however , we point out that different solutions exhibit not only different amplitudes , but also slightly different characteristic lengths : in general , increments on @xmath6  and/or @xmath7  lead to decrements on amplitudes and/or characteristic length . even in this case",

    "the lumps profile are similar to those the magnetic field . however , in this case , for a fixed @xmath6 and an increasing @xmath7 , the amplitudes experience a large increase and , the characteristic lengths decreased slightly . on the other hand , for a fixed @xmath7 and an increasing @xmath6 , the amplitude will decrease significantly but the characteristic lengths remain almost fixed by a compensatory effect relating @xmath6 and @xmath7 .     for @xmath112 .",

    "the profiles experience a slight change .",
    "however for @xmath7 fixed and an increment in @xmath6 , the profile s amplitudes experience a considerable decrease .",
    "in the present letter , we have performed the development of a first - order theoretical framework in the context of a generalized mcs - higgs model given by ( [ m ] ) . in the present case , the non - standard model , including its self - dual potential ( [ p ] ) , is given in terms of three different functions , @xmath20 , @xmath43 and @xmath3 , which are functions of the scalar fields only . here , in order to avoid problems with the energy of the model , @xmath79 and @xmath115 must be positive - definite .",
