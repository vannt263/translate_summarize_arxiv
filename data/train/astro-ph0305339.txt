    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are tracers of the formation of the galaxy to which they belong .",
    "one key way to analyze the stellar populations of a gc is to determine its rr  lyrae ( rrl ) content , which is tied to the horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology .",
    "oosterhoff ( 1939 ) discovered a fundamental division of galactic gcs into two groups based on the mean periods of their rrl stars .",
    "it was later shown that this division was associated with gc metallicity : metal - rich gcs tend to have shorter period rrl stars compared to metal - poor gcs ( arp 1955b ; kinman 1959 ) .",
    "understanding the oosterhoff effect and its effect on rrl stars is key for determining accurate distances and ages for the galactic gcs , and ultimately has consequences on how we view the formation of our galaxy .",
    "sandage & wildey ( 1967 ) and van den bergh ( 1967 ) found that a number of metal - poor gcs have very different hb morphologies even though they have very similar values of [ fe / h ] .",
    "it was concluded that at least one parameter , in addition to metallicity , affects the hb .",
    "they also pointed out that the most distant gcs exhibited strong second parameter effects , having red hbs despite their low metallicities . since then it has been shown that a gc s galactocentric distance plays a role in the strength of the second parameter in the sense that at small galactocentric distances the hb morphology and [ fe / h ] are closely tied to one another , while going out to larger distances one finds that there is more scatter in the hb morphologies , with the hb type becoming redder for a given [ fe / h ] ( searle & zinn 1978 ; zinn 1980 ; lee , demarque , & zinn 1994 ) . a difference in cluster ages has been proposed as one explanation for the second parameter effect , but there are cases where this may not be the only explanation for unusual hb morphologies ( e.g. , fusi pecci , bellazzini , & ferraro 1996 ; fusi pecci & bellazzini 1997 ) .",
    "any second - parameter affecting the hb morphology will also affect any rrl stars found in that cluster .",
    "thus , as pointed out by catelan , sweigart , & borissova ( 1998 ) , rrl stars may also provide a probe into the second - parameter phenomenon , which in turn may be directly related to the origin of the oosterhoff dichotomy itself ( castellani 1983 ; renzini 1983 ; lee & zinn 1990 ) .",
    "while the second - parameter effect has primarily been found in more metal - poor gcs , two metal - rich systems , ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 , have been found to have very unusual hb morphologies for their metallicities ( rich et al .",
    "with metallicities of @xmath1 } \\sim -0.6 $ ] these clusters not only have strong red hbs similar to the canonical metal - rich gc 47  tucanae , they also have components to their hbs that extend blueward across the instability strip and terminate in blue tails .",
    "in addition , the red hbs in both clusters are sloped toward increasing brightness as one moves blueward along the hb , which can not be explained by differential reddening alone . to make these gcs even more interesting , sweigart & catelan ( 1998 )",
    "have claimed that non - canonical effects are needed to explain the sloped nature of the hbs .",
    "rich et al .  speculated that the high central concentrations of ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 may have led to higher interactions in the inner regions of the clusters , resulting in the bluer hbs  without however providing an explanation for the sloping nature of the hbs .",
    "however , both rich et al .  and layden et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found that this hypothesis did not hold because the blue hb stars were not centrally concentrated .    in attempting to model the hbs in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 , sweigart & catelan ( 1998 ) proposed three alternatives , ( i ) a high cluster helium abundance , ( ii ) an increase in helium core mass due to rotation on the red giant branch , and ( iii ) enhancement of the envelope helium abundance due to deep mixing",
    "the high helium abundance scenario has subsequently been ruled out on observational grounds ( layden et al .",
    "1999 ; raimondo et al .",
    "other explanations for these unusual hb morphologies have ranged from increased mass loss along the red giant branch , to a spread in metallicity , to the clusters being dwarf galaxy remnants ( piotto et al .",
    "1997 ; sweigart 2002 ; ree et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "all three scenarios introduced by sweigart & catelan ( 1998 ) require that the hbs of ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 be unusually bright for the metal abundances of the clusters . as a consequence",
    ", any rrl stars found in these clusters would also be unusually bright and would therefore have unusually long periods for their metallicity .",
    "surveys of the variable star content of ngc  6388 ( silbermann et al .  1994 ; pritzl et al .",
    "2002 ) and ngc  6441 ( layden et al .  1999 ; pritzl et al .",
    "2001 ) found that their rrl stars did indeed have periods that are unusually long for the cluster metallicity . on the other hand ,",
    "the gravities ( for the hot hb stars ) measured by moehler , sweigart , & catelan ( 1999 ) imply that the blue hb stars in these clusters are not anomalously bright , contrary to the sweigart & catelan ( 1998 ) predictions .    due to the compact nature of these clusters [ @xmath2 ( ngc  6388 ) , 5.25 ( ngc  6441 ) ]",
    ", it is very difficult to survey the inner regions of the clusters , where most of the cluster variables are expected to be found , from the ground . making use of the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) snapshot program , we have obtained images of the inner region of ngc  6441 to survey its variable star content with the wide field planetary camera  2 ( wfpc2 ) .",
    "we present in this paper the results of our survey and compare the properties of the variable stars found in the inner region of the cluster to those variables found in the outer regions from the ground - based surveys .",
    "we also examine the nature of the population  ii cepheids ( p2cs ) found in ngc  6441 and ngc  6388 and compare them with those in other gcs .",
    "eighteen sets of observations in @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath0 were taken by the hst with the wide - field planetary camera  2 starting on 1999 march 16 and ending on 2000 june 30 as part of the snap  8251 program .",
    "the complete list of observations is given in table  1 , including ngc  6441 hst archive observations which were added to our reductions ( go  5667 , go  6095 , and go  6780 ) .",
    "exposure times for each filter are also listed in table  1 .",
    "ngc  6441 was centered on the wfc3 chip for our program .",
    "no restrictions were made on the orientation of the observations .",
    "therefore , rotations between the images , in addition to translations , produced partial and varying overlap among the images obtained on the other three chips .",
    "the observations were reduced using the daophot/ allstar/ allframe routines ( e.g. , stetson 1987 , 1994 ) .",
    "we used standard point - spread functions that had been prepared for each chip and filter in the course of the _ hubble space telescope key project on the extragalactic distance scale _",
    "( e.g. , freedman et al .  2001 ; stetson et al .  1998 ) and our previous research on outer - halo globulars ( e.g. , harris et al .  1997 , stetson et al .  1999 ) .",
    "after the geometric relationships relating the various images to a common coordinate system and a master star list for the field had been generated , allframe was used to obtain final stellar positions on the sky , and a magnitude measurement for each star at each epoch .",
    "aperture corrections were determined from comparatively bright , isolated stars in each image to relate them to a well - defined , common instrumental zero - point .",
    "charge - transfer efficiency corrections and fundamental photometric zero - points similar to those of stetson ( 1998 ) , but based on a much larger database , and the color corrections of holtzman et al.(1995 ) were applied in the standard fashion .",
    "figure  1 shows the photometric uncertainty in @xmath4 at the level of the hb as a function of clustercentric radius .",
    "we assumed @xmath5  mag and chose a range of magnitudes around this value of @xmath6  mag .",
    "all candidate variable stars were removed .",
    "the @xmath7 relationship is nearly independent of radius .",
    "this suggests that at these limits our photometric errors are dominated by photon statistics and fitting errors and not by crowding for most stars . the increased photometric uncertainty at large radii occurs because , with the differing roll angles of the spacecraft , not all stars could be measured at all epochs .",
    "variable stars were found by a variety of methods including a variant of the welch & stetson ( 1993 ) algorithm ( see stetson 1996 ) .",
    "finding charts for the variables can be seen in figure  2 .",
    "we used the period finding routines described in layden et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and layden & sarajedini ( 2000 ) to determine the periods of the variable stars .",
    "this technique involves folding each star s magnitude - time data by a sequence of periods , and at each period , fitting the resulting light curve with a set of template light curves .",
    "if the period being tested is near the star s true period , the template will fit the data well and produce a small value of @xmath8 .",
    "probable periods are represented by @xmath8 minima in the array of periods and templates considered .",
    "we searched for periods in the range appropriate for each class of variable ; e.g. , for rrl stars the range was 0.2 to 1.0  day .",
    "once a period was found , the search was narrowed to about 0.0001  day around the candidate period to determine the best period . in almost all cases , we found a single , dominant @xmath8 minimum , suggesting that aliasing was not a problem despite the irregular sampling and long time interval over which the data were gathered .",
    "the few exceptions involved a small number of first - overtone ( rrc ) stars which produced light curves with significant scatter , and long period variables ( lpvs ) whose entire light cycle was not covered by our observations .",
    "we derived pulsation amplitudes and intensity - weighted magnitudes from the fitted templates .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in these magnitudes to be 0.020.03  mag for the rrl stars and population  ii cepheid ( p2c ) stars .",
    "typical uncertainties in the rrl and p2c periods are estimated to be 0.00002 and 0.002  days .",
    "the magnitude and period uncertainties are considerably larger for the lpv stars . in part",
    ", this is because the templates we used are not optimal for lpv stars , but a more significant discrepancy arises because many of the lpvs may not demonstrate pulsations with a regular period .",
    "the analysis here is intended only to classify the type of pulsation and to establish approximate mean - light parameters so the stars may be placed in the cmd .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of the lpv stars in ngc  6441 is reserved for a future paper .",
    "figure  3 shows the positions of the variables in the color - magnitude diagrams for ngc  6441 in @xmath4 versus ( a ) @xmath9 and ( b ) @xmath10 , where variables are plotted according to their intensity - weighted @xmath11 magnitudes and @xmath12 and @xmath13 colors .",
    "figures  3c and 3d give an expanded view of the hb .",
    "the variable stars along the hb are clearly rrl stars ; those brighter than the hb and located toward the red but blueward of the red giant branch are p2cs ; those found after the turnover of the red giant branch are lpvs . however , as noted above , a number of the lpvs have poor periods due to aliasing and have larger uncertainties in their mean magnitudes .",
    "we also found one @xmath14  scuti star ( v95 ) , but given its magnitude it is likely a member of the field . due to the small number of data points and the gaps in the phase coverage",
    ", we did not attempt to do a fourier analysis of the light curves .    in the next sections we present the detailed results of our survey for variable stars and discuss their properties .",
    "comparisons are also made to the variables found in ground - based surveys to determine any similarities and differences in their properties as compared to those found in this study .",
    "we were able to find 38 candidate rrl stars in the inner region of ngc  6441 , with 24 of them being new .",
    "previous ground - based surveys ( layden et al .  1999 ; pritzl et al .",
    "2001 ) of the cluster found another 25 rrl stars which are not included in the field coverage of the present study .",
    "we also confirmed the variability of three stars whose variablility had been suspected , but not confirmed .",
    "thus , the total number of rrl stars known in ngc  6441 with definite classification and membership is now 63 .",
    "figure  4 shows the light curves of the 57 variables we identified where layden s template - fitting routines were used to fit the data .",
    "tables  2 , 3 , and 4 list the @xmath15 photometric data for the variable stars .",
    "the mean properties of the variable stars are given in table  5 .",
    "the mean periods for the 26 fundamental ( rrab ) and 12 rrc stars found in this survey are 0.753  d and 0.365  d , respectively .",
    "these values match up very well with those found from the ground - based surveys , which were @xmath16  d and @xmath17  d for 24 and 9 stars , respectively ( pritzl et al .",
    "the variables listed in table  5 from v55 to v102 , were included in both the ground - based and hst surveys , so that the two samples are not completely independent . combining the periods of the rrl stars with good light curves , accurate classifications , and certain membership found in this survey and the ground - based survey",
    ", we find the average periods for 42 rrab and 21 rrc stars in ngc  6441 to be 0.759  d and 0.375  d , respectively .",
    "the ratio of rrc to rrl stars is 0.33 .",
    "as noted in pritzl et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2001 ) , the mean period of the rrab stars is higher than that found in the typical oosterhoff  ii cluster .",
    "the mean period of the rrc stars is similar to that for oosterhoff  ii clusters , while the @xmath18 ratio is somewhere between the values found for oosterhoff  i and ii clusters .",
    "considering only the rrab stars newly discovered in this survey , we find a mean period of 0.765  d. this is slightly larger than one might expect given the result from the ground - based surveys ( layden et al .",
    "1999 ; pritzl et al .",
    "since the hst observations allowed us to better survey the inner region of ngc  6441 , it may be that there is a difference between the mean properties of the rrl in the inner and outer regions . to make a more quantitative argument",
    ", we find the rrab stars within 20 arcsec of the cluster center to have a mean period of 0.766  d ( 17 rrab stars ) .",
    "those outside this assumed radius have a mean period of 0.754  d ( 25 stars ) .",
    "the radius of 20  arcsec was chosen as the best to illustrate the difference in mean period .",
    "for radii less than this we begin to enter small - number statistics and for more than this the mean periods progressively get closer to matching .",
    "another way to view the shift in period is shown in figure  5 .",
    "the histogram in fig .",
    "5a illustrates that the distribution of rrl stars in ngc  6441 is closer to that of an oosterhoff  ii cluster than that of an oosterhoff  i cluster , as discussed in pritzl et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2001 ) . a comparison of fig .",
    "5b and 5c shows an excess of longer period rrab stars within 20  arcsec of the cluster center",
    ". some caution must be exercised , however , before one can conclude that the difference is real .",
    "a two - sample k - s test run on the inner and outer rrab results in a @xmath19 statistic of 0.2259 , which means that the two distributions are the same at a 62.1% confidence level .",
    "a student @xmath20-test , which specifically tests if two distributions are different based on their means , was also run and resulted in a @xmath20 value of 0.411 , which means that the two distributions are indistinguishable at a 68.3% confidence level .",
    "this confirms the k - s test , thus suggesting that the two samples are not significantly different , in a statistical sense .",
    "while our hst observations have been able to survey the inner regions of ngc  6441 , crowding in the regions just outside this survey area may have prevented low amplitude , long period rrab stars from being detected in the ground - based surveys .",
    "as an example , adding five stars with periods of 0.85  d outside 20  arcsec would change the mean period to match that found for the rrab inside 20  arcsec .",
    "we also note that if v118 is truly a p2c ( see  4 ) and not an evolved rrl star , the mean period for the rrab stars within 20  arcsec would be 0.753  d. this matches up very well with the mean period for the rrab stars outside 20  arcsec and argues that there may be no significant difference between the rrab populations inside and outside 20  arcsec .",
    "further observations of ngc  6441 with better resolution at larger radii may help clear up any distinctions between the inner and outer rrab stars .",
    "alternately , application of the isis image subtraction package ( alard 2000 ) may improve the detection of low amplitude variables in the crowded regions of ngc  6441 observed from the ground .",
    "we did not discuss the rrc stars given their relatively low numbers .",
    "we derive the mean magnitude for the rrl stars to be @xmath21  mag , where the error is the standard deviation of the mean .",
    "this matches up well with what was found in the ground - based survey of pritzl et al .",
    "( 2001 ; @xmath22  mag ) .",
    "as seen in figure  3 , a number of the candidate rrl stars are found at magnitudes brighter than the majority of the rrl stars .",
    "these variable stars have periods of 0.90582  d ( v56 ) , 0.76867  d ( v110 ) , 0.61419  d ( v112 ) , 0.97923  d ( v118 ) , 0.80573  d ( v136 ) , and 0.55581 ( v145 ) .",
    "it may be that differential reddening is playing a role given that there is a small number of rrl stars fainter than the majority of the rrl stars .",
    "it has already been shown from the rrl star light curves that differential reddening affects the ground - based observations of ngc  6441 ( layden et al .",
    "1999 ; pritzl et al .",
    "we did not attempt to determine the reddenings from the rrab stars in this survey via their @xmath9 color at the minimum ( blanco 1992 ) due to the small number of data points .",
    "it may also be the case that some of these stars have evolved further from the zero - age hb and are thus more luminous .",
    "the periods for two of the stars , v118 ( and , to a lesser extent v56 ) and v145 , are long for rrab and rrc stars , respectively .",
    "in fact , given the magnitude and the period of v118 , it may be the faintest p2c in the cluster ( see  4 ) .",
    "figure  6 shows the period - amplitude diagrams for the newly discovered rrl stars and those previously found ( pritzl et al .",
    "in general , the rrl stars from the two data sets lie in the same regions of the diagrams .",
    "there is more of a spread among the rrab in fig .",
    "6c because the @xmath0-band light curves have more scatter than the @xmath3 and @xmath4 light curves . from figure  6",
    "we see that the general properties of the rrl stars found in the inner region of the cluster are the same as those found in the outer regions .",
    "it was noted in layden et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and pritzl et al .",
    "( 2001 ) that some of the rrab stars were likely blended with other stars , producing lower than expected amplitudes for their periods .",
    "such blends are likely given the compact nature of this cluster . the candidate blended stars from the ground - based surveys can be seen in figure  6 as those rrab stars which are scattered toward lower amplitudes . in table  6",
    ", we show the comparison between the variable stars found in both this survey and the ground - based survey of pritzl et al .",
    "there are clearly a number of stars which appeared significantly brighter in the ground - based survey and had lower amplitudes than found in the present survey .",
    "we also examined the images for stars neighboring those listed in table  6 .",
    "all of the stars listed which showed significant differences in their magnitudes and periods were found to have nearby stars that likely affected the photometry of the ground - based studies .",
    "the higher resolution of the wfpc2 indicates that the previous conclusion of the  low amplitude \" rrab stars in the ground - based survey being blends was correct .",
    "there is also the possibility that some of these stars may be experiencing the blazhko effect which also affects the amplitudes of rrl stars .",

    "( 1999 ) and pritzl et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2001 ) found that the rrab stars in ngc  6441 lie at longer periods in the period - amplitude diagram compared to field rrab stars of similar metallicity .",

    "the difference between these types is not only defined by their periods , but also by their origins . as reviewed by wallerstein ( 2002 , but see also bono et al .",
    "1997b ) , bl  her stars are believed to derive from stars which have evolved from the hb bluer than the rrl gap , and which are now evolving redward through the instability strip at luminosities brighter than those of rrl stars . by contrast , w  vir stars , while also considered to be the progeny of blue hb stars ( e.g. , gingold 1985 ) , are believed to be undergoing helium shell flashes leading them along blueward loops into the instability strip as they move up the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "this is consistent with studies of period changes in p2cs in gcs .",
    "wehlau & bohlender ( 1982 ) found that of 12 bl  her stars in galactic gcs , nine had increasing periods , three had unchanging periods , and zero had decreasing periods .",
    "increasing periods are expected for variables evolving redward from the blue hb toward the agb . for the w",
    "vir stars the picture is not so clear , but clement , hogg , & yee ( 1988 ) found that a number of w  vir stars showed both increases and decreases in period , and that at least two variables showed long term period decreases consistent with blueward evolution .",
    "the period change observations for w  vir stars are thus at least consistent with evolution of w  vir stars into and out of the instability strip during blueward loops .      given the relatively large number of p2cs found in both ngc  6441 and ngc  6388",
    ", we would like to determine the p - l relations for these stars .",
    "we use the distance modulus derived in  3.2 for ngc  6441 , @xmath31  mag , to derive the absolute magnitudes for the p2cs found in this survey . for ngc  6388",
    ", we follow the prescription used for ngc  6441 to derive its distance modulus .",
    "since we assume that the rrl stars in ngc  6388 are of a similar nature as those in ngc  6441 , we adopt the same absolute magnitude for its rrl stars , @xmath26  mag .    in table  7",
    "we list the data for the p2cs in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 . for our discussions here , we will include v118 with the p2cs , although its precise classification is uncertain .",
    "we have chosen not to include v56 since its period and magnitude are not unreasonably different from the other rrl stars .",
    "we have assumed @xmath30 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , and have adopted mean reddenings of @xmath40 and @xmath41 for ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 , respectively ( pritzl et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "figure  8 shows the absolute magnitudes of the p2cs in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 for the various filters . in each panel of figure  8 , we see that the p2cs form a surprisingly good correlation from shorter to longer periods , with the lone exception of one star in ngc  6388 .",
    "v29 of ngc  6388 was shown to be unusually bright for its period in pritzl et al .",
    "( 2002 ) leading to the idea that it may be blended with another star . leaving that star out , we determined the following p - l relations ,    @xmath42    @xmath43    @xmath44    with correlation coefficients @xmath45 , 0.985 , and 0.998 , respectively . the root - mean - square deviation for each relation is 0.07 , 0.10 , and 0.06 for @xmath4 , @xmath3 , and @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "both the slopes for @xmath46 and @xmath47 match up quite well with those found by mcnamara ( 1995 , eqns .",

    "( 1998 , eqn .",
    "5 ) for longer period p2cs .",
    "the tight fits to the relations also indicate that all of the p2cs in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 are likely to be pulsating in one mode , presumably the fundamental mode . following the suggestion by alcock et al",
    ".  that adding a color term results in better relations , we calculated the p - l - c relations for the ngc  6441 and ngc  6388 p2cs and found no significant improvement in the quality of the fit .",
    "this may be explained by the already excellent correlation of the p2cs in the p - l relations and the fact that alcock et al .",
    "found the rv  tauri ( rv  tau ; @xmath48  days ) benefited the greatest in adding in the color term .      defining a clear p - l relation is important in the use of cepheid variable stars in distance determinations .",
    "while other cepheid - type variables such as the classical and anomalous types have their p - l relations well - defined , the relations for the p2cs in general are still somewhat uncertain .",
    "arp ( 1955a ) argued that p2cs follow at least two parallel p - l relations , one each for fundamental and overtone mode pulsators .",
    "others later favored a single p - l relation to describe the p2cs ( e.g. , dickens & carey 1967 ; demers & harris 1974 ) . harris ( 1985 ) also assumed a single p - l relation , but with a break toward a steeper slope for p2cs with periods greater than 12.5  days .",
    "the theoretical @xmath3-band p - l relations of bono et al .",
    "( 1997b ) show a break in slope near @xmath49  days at the faint boundary of the domain in which p2cs might exist , but no break in slope at the brighter boundary .",
    "in their paper on population  ii variable stars , nemec , nemec & lutz ( 1994 ) revived arp s model stating that p2cs are pulsating in either fundamental or first overtone modes , which followed their theme that all pulsating variable stars can be found to have both pulsation modes .",
    "however , mcnamara ( 1995 ) , using the data from nemec et al .",
    ", stated that the observations were better fit by one line describing the bl  her stars ( @xmath37  d ) and another fitted to the w  vir stars ( @xmath50  d ) , similar to what was argued by harris ( 1985 ) .",
    "recently , alcock et al .  (",
    "1998 ) used a sample of 33 p2cs in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) in the period range of @xmath51 to compare the various p - l relations . while noting that the galactic gc p - l relations provided adequate fits to the shorter period lmc p2cs , they found that those p - l relations did not provide a good fit for the longer period rv  tau stars , which appear more luminous than the p - l relations predicted . combining the galactic gc and lmc data sets , alcock et al .",
    "found that the shorter period galactic gc p2cs provided a good linear extension to the lmc data with the rv  tau stars turning toward brighter magnitudes . to account for this , alcock et al .  included a color term to their p - l relations for @xmath52 , which greatly reduced the scatter in the data and the up - turn of the rv  tau stars .",
    "they concluded that the rv  tau stars are direct extensions of the other p2c types .",
    "unfortunately , the alcock et al .",
    "data were taken with @xmath4 and @xmath53 filters , while most of the galactic gc data is in @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this makes the application of their p - l - c relation difficult to apply to other data sets .    to help clarify the issue of the differing slopes found by various studies , we investigated the p2cs in other gcs and incorporated them in our analysis .",
    "table  8 lists the properties of the galactic gc p2cs summarizing the data found in the literature .",
    "we estimated the absolute magnitudes for each star using eqn .",
    "7 of lee et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and the metallicities , reddenings , and @xmath54 given in harris ( 1996 ) .",
    "the format is the same as in table  7 .",
    "we plot the best available data for the galactic gc p2cs in the top row of figure  9 , including those found by alcock et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in the lmc where they adopted a distance modulus of 18.5  mag .",
    "the only p2cs not included in the plot were those from ngc  4372 , which are clearly too faint .",
    "the periods listed for these stars may be correct , but the faint magnitudes may be due to the fact that kaluzny & krzeminski ( 1993 ) were searching for contact binaries and sx  phoenicis stars resulting in the candidate p2cs being saturated .",
    "there is some scatter among the p2cs in fig .  9a , which is to be expected since it is known that there is some width to the instability strip .",
    "9b shows a lot of scatter which may possibly be attributed to the presence of older photographic data , as compared to the @xmath0 data in fig .",
    "9c which is only from ccd data .",
    "we plot in the bottom row of figure  9 only those p2cs with ccd photometry , except again for ngc  4372 .",
    "this helps to reduce the scatter , as seen in fig .",
    "9d , but some still remains . without any color information we are not able to tell if this scatter may be intrinsic , possibly due to the width of the p2c instability strip , or if it is photometric .",
    "it should be noted that the scatter seen at shorter periods in fig .",
    "9d can be attributed to the @xmath55  cen p2cs , a number of which have poor light curves ( kaluzny et al .",
    "1997 ) . for @xmath3 and @xmath0 ,",
    "the ccd data are mostly taken from this study , but it is encouraging that the other data are consistent with what we have found .    taking a closer look at the @xmath3 and @xmath0 data , it does not look like there is a change in the slope between the bl  her and w  vir stars .",
    "however , this is a tentative conclusion given the fact that most of the data comes from this survey alone . if we examine the @xmath4 data in fig .  9d",
    ", where more points are available , we can make some stronger arguments .",
    "there is clearly a change in the slope toward brighter magnitudes at longer periods .",
    "the question is whether this change is found at or around 10 or 12 days as suggested by harris ( 1985 ) and mcnamara ( 1995 ) or at a longer period .",
    "if we consider only the bl  her and w  vir stars , there is statistically no change in the slope between the two groups of p2cs .",
    "on the other hand , if we consider the rv  tau stars , they clearly have a different slope from that of the shorter period cepheids .",
    "it appears , therefore , that a single p - l relationship can be used to describe the p2cs until periods greater than about 20 days are reached , when variables with rv  tau characteristics begin to enter the mix .",
    "unfortunately , given the scarcity of data , we are not able to test the conclusion of alcock et al .",
    "( 1998 ) that adding in the color term to the rv  tau stars brings them more into line with the other p2c types .",
    "another possibility is raised by fig .",
    "alcock et al .  (",
    "1998 ) identified a number of w  vir stars found in the lmc that are brighter than the bulk of the w  vir stars .",
    "these variables appear to constitute a straight line in combination with the brighter rv  tau stars that appears to be parallel to a line that could be drawn through the bl  her and w  vir stars .",
    "alcock et al ( 1998 ) classified their rv  tau stars as those having periods longer than 20  days .",
    "it may be that some of their w  vir stars are actually rv  tau stars , and vice versa .",
    "there appears to be in reality no sharp dividing line between the w  vir and rv  tau stars , with the longest period w  vir variables gradually taking on rv  tau characteristics ( alcock et al .",
    "1998 ) .    at this point",
    ", it is uncertain how well the relations created from the ngc  6441 and ngc  6388 p2cs apply to other gcs given the small amount of ccd photometry .",
    "two of the more important questions are how good are the zeropoints we are using to derive the absolute magnitudes and is there any metallicity dependence in the relations which is currently not being taken into account in our relations .",
    "clearly , more ccd photometry needs to be taken of p2cs in order to clarify these issues , especially in the @xmath3 and @xmath0 filters , before any firm conclusions can be drawn .",
    "we have found 57 variable stars in the inner regions of ngc  6441 using the hst snapshot observing program , 41 of which were previously undiscovered . of the rrl stars found in this survey , 26 are rrab stars and 12 are rrc stars .",
    "there are no clear differences in the properties of the rrl stars in the inner and outer regions of the cluster .",
    "this is illustrated in the period - amplitude diagram where the rrl stars in this survey are located in the same regions as those found in the ground - based surveys ( layden et al .",
    "1999 ; pritzl et al .",
    "2001 ) . combining the rrl stars in this survey and those found in ground - based surveys , we find the mean periods of the rrab and rrc stars to be 0.759  d and 0.375  d. this reaffirms that ngc  6441 is unusual when compared to other galactic gcs in that , whereas it is a metal - rich gc ,",
    "its rrl stars have mean periods that are similar to , if not greater than , those of very metal - poor gcs .",
    "this reconfirms the conclusions of pritzl et al .",
    "( 2001 ) that the rrl stars in ngc  6441 are unusually bright for their metallicity .",
    "this breaks the general metallicity - luminosity relation for the rrl stars and has consequences on their use as distance indicators . a possible trend of the inner rrab stars ( @xmath56  arcsec ) having a longer mean period than the remaining rrab stars was also detected , but further observations will be needed to make definitive conclusions .",
    "we also used the @xmath0-band photometry to derive p - l relations for the rrl stars .",
    "we also found six p2cs in ngc 6441 making it , along with its  sister \" cluster ngc  6388 , the most metal - rich gc to contain this type of variable star .",
    "five of the p2cs are of w  vir type and one is a bl  her star . also , v118 may be an additional bl her variable given its bright magnitude and long period compared to the rrl stars . under the assumption that the rrl stars in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 have absolute magnitudes similar to those of metal - poor gcs",
    ", we have derived the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath0 period - luminosity relations for their p2cs .",
    "these p - l relations do not show the change in slope around @xmath57  day which some have suggested and show a surprisingly tight correlation .",
    "we also find that only one p - l relation is needed to describe the data , i.e. , it appears that the p2cs are pulsating in one mode .",
    "an examination of the p2cs in gcs for which @xmath4 ccd photometry is available indicates that the break in the slope of the p2c p - l relation does not come at periods of 10 or 12 days , but at longer periods , where the p2cs begin to take on rv  tau characteristics .",

    "<S> we present the results of a _ hubble space telescope _ snapshot program to survey the inner region of the metal - rich globular cluster ngc  6441 for its variable stars . </S>",
    "<S> a total of 57 variable stars was found including 38 rr  lyrae stars , 6 population  ii cepheids , and 12 long period variables . </S>",
    "<S> twenty - four of the rr  lyrae stars and all of the population  ii cepheids were previously undiscovered in ground - based surveys . </S>",
    "<S> of the rr  lyrae stars observed in this survey , 26 are pulsating in the fundamental mode with a mean period of 0.753  d and 12 are first - overtone mode pulsators with a mean period of 0.365  d. these values match up very well with those found in ground - based surveys . </S>",
    "<S> combining all the available data for ngc  6441 , we find mean periods of 0.759  d and 0.375  d for the rrab and rrc stars , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the rr  lyrae in this survey are located in the same regions of a period - amplitude diagram as those found in ground - based surveys . </S>",
    "<S> the overall ratio of rrc to total rr  lyrae is 0.33 . </S>",
    "<S> although ngc  6441 is a metal - rich globular cluster and would , on that ground , be expected either to have few rr  lyrae stars , or to be an oosterhoff type  i system , its rr  lyrae more closely resemble those in oosterhoff type  ii globular clusters . however , even compared to typical oosterhoff type  ii systems , the mean period of its rrab stars is unusually long . </S>",
    "<S> we also derived @xmath0-band period - luminosity relations for the rr  lyrae stars .    </S>",
    "<S> of the six population  ii cepheids , five are of w  virginis type and one is a bl  herculis variable star . </S>",
    "<S> this makes ngc  6441 , along with ngc  6388 , the most metal - rich globular cluster known to contain these types of variable stars . </S>",
    "<S> another variable , v118 , may also be a population  ii cepheid given its long period and its separation in magnitude from the rr  lyrae stars . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the period - luminosity relation for these population  ii cepheids and compare it to those in other globular clusters and in the large magellanic cloud . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that there does not appear to be a change in the period - luminosity relation slope between the bl  herculis and w  virginis stars , but that a change of slope does occur when the rv  tauri stars are added to the period - luminosity relation . </S>"
