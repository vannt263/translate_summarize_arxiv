    "mixed - morphology supernova remnants ( mm snrs ) have center - filled thermal x - ray emissions in a synchrotron radio shell @xcite .",
    "although the formation mechanism of the non - standard morphology has not been fully understood , there are two proposed scenarios .",
    "one is the evaporating cloudlet scenario @xcite , and the other is the thermal conduction scenario @xcite . in either scenario ,",
    "interactions between the blast wave and dense gas play an important role in the formation of the x - ray morphology .",
    "most mm snrs are actually associated with molecular clouds as indicated by co line emissions or oh ( 1720 mhz ) masers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "they also exhibit gev / tev gamma - ray emissions which suggest shell - cloud interactions since those snrs can emit luminous gamma rays through @xmath4 decays ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in the asca observation of the mm snr ic  443 , kawasaki et al .",

    "they found that @xmath5 is significantly higher than @xmath7 , and suggested that the plasma is overionized . in the observations of ic  443 @xcite and w49b @xcite with suzaku",
    ", they discovered radiative recombining continua ( rrc ) , which provide clear evidence that the plasmas are in an extremely recombining state .",
    "subsequent suzaku observations revealed recombining plasmas ( rps ) in other mm snrs in the galaxy ( e.g. , g359.1@xmath80.5 : @xcite ; w28 : @xcite ; w44 : @xcite ) as well as in the large magellanic cloud ( n49 : @xcite ) .",
    "two scenarios are mainly considered for the formation process of the rps .",
    "one is the rarefaction scenario @xcite .",
    "if a supernova explodes in a dense circumstellar matter ( csm ) around the massive progenitor , ejecta and the csm are shock - heated and quickly ionized because of the high density .",
    "when the shock breaks the csm out to a lower density interstellar medium ( ism ) , @xmath9 is decreased by adiabatic cooling . @xcite",
    "proposed the other scenario , the thermal conduction scenario .",
    "if an snr shock is interacting with a molecular cloud , thermal conduction occurs between the snr plasma and the cloud , and , therefore , @xmath9 drops .",
    "since the recombination timescales of ions are generally longer than the conduction timescales , @xmath5 can not follow the decrease of @xmath9 , and rps can be realized .",
    "g166.0 + 4.3 is a galactic snr whose radio shell has a large bipolar structure in the west with a smaller semicircle shell in the east @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated the distance to g166.0 + 4.3 as @xmath10  kpc by using the @xmath11-@xmath12-@xmath13 ( surface brightness - diameter - distance above the galactic plane ) relationship .",
    "@xcite suggested that the gas density in the east is higher than that in the west because of the unusual morphology of the radio shell .",
