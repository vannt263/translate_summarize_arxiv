    "the orientation - preserving free actions of a finite group @xmath0 on 3-dimensional orientable handlebodies have a close connection with a long - studied concept from group theory , namely _ nielsen equivalence _ of generating sets . indeed , as we observe in section  [ sec : theory ] below , the free actions of @xmath0 on the handlebody of genus @xmath7 , up to equivalence , correspond to the nielsen equivalence classes of @xmath3-element generating sets of @xmath0 , where @xmath4 .",
    "we will utilize this to prove a number of results about equivalence and weak equivalence of free actions .",
    "these results are summarized in concise form in section  [ sec : results ] , which also contains precise definitions of equivalence , weak equivalence , and other concepts that we shall use .",
    "a special feature of free actions on handlebodies is that there is a stabilization process relating actions on different genera . when a handlebody @xmath10 with a free @xmath0-action contains a @xmath0-invariant handlebody @xmath11 such that @xmath12 consists of disjoint @xmath13-handles , the action on @xmath10 is called a stabilization of the action on @xmath11 .",
    "inequivalent actions can become equivalent after stabilization , indeed we do not know an example of actions that remain inequivalent after even an elementary stabilization ( i.  e.  a stabilization for which @xmath12 consists of @xmath14 @xmath13-handles ) .",
    "such an example could not involve a solvable group , since a result of m. dunwoody implies that for solvable @xmath0 , any two actions on a handlebody of more than the minimum possible genus for a @xmath0-action are equivalent ( see corollary  [ coro : solvable corollary 2 ] below ) . for an arbitrary @xmath0 , proposition  [ prop : stabilization ] shows that any two actions become equivalent after @xmath15 elementary stabilizations , where @xmath15 is the minimum number of generators of @xmath0 .",
    "we remark that there is an interesting theory of stabilization of actions on @xmath16-manifolds  @xcite .",
    "the connection between free actions on handlebodies and nielsen equivalence is well - known in some circles , although we can not find an explicit statement in the literature .",
    "it was known to j. kalliongis and a. miller and is is a direct consequence of theorem  1.3 in their paper @xcite ( for free actions , the graph of groups will have trivial vertex and edge groups , and the equivalence of graphs of groups defined there is readily seen to be the same as nielsen equivalence on generating sets of @xmath0 ) .",
    "indeed , more delicate classifications of nonfree actions on handlebodies have been examined in considerable depth .",
    "a general theory of actions was given in  @xcite and  @xcite , and the actions on very low genera were extensively studied in  @xcite .",
    "actions with the genus small relative to the order of the group are investigated in  @xcite , and the special case of orientation - reversing involutions is treated in  @xcite . the first focus on free actions seems to be  @xcite , where it was proven that for a cyclic group , any free action on a handlebody of genus above the minimal one is the stabilization of an action on minimal genus , and that any two free actions on a handlebody are weakly equivalent .",
    "these results were generalized to dihedral and abelian groups in  @xcite , whose results are reconfirmed and extended in section  [ sec : abelian and dihedral ] below .    some of the arguments in this paper can be shortened by invoking results from  @xcite .",
    "since the general theory given there is much more elaborate than the elementary methods needed for the present work , we have chosen to make our arguments self - contained . after giving some more precise definitions and stating our main results in section  [ sec : results ] , we develop the general theory relating free actions to nielsen equivalence in section  [ sec : theory ] .",
    "we apply this in section  [ sec : solvable groups ] to treat the case when @xmath0 is solvable , and in section  [ sec : abelian and dihedral ] we examine the specific cases of abelian and dihedral groups . in section  [ sec : free actions of psl(2,3p ) ] , we show that for @xmath6 prime , two free actions of @xmath5 on a handlebody of genus above the minimal one are equivalent . by work of evans @xcite and gilman @xcite ,",
    "it is known that the same is true for @xmath17 ( for all @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 ( for @xmath6 prime ) .",
    "section  [ sec : stabilization of actions ] gives some general results on stabilization , in particular , we prove that if the genus of @xmath10 is at least @xmath20 , where @xmath9 is the maximum length of a decreasing chain of nonzero subgroups of @xmath0 , then any two free @xmath0-actions are equivalent . in section  [ sec : questions ] , we state some open problems . in particular , do there even exist inequivalent actions that are not minimal genus actions ?",
    "two ( effective ) actions @xmath21 are said to be _ equivalent _ if they are conjugate as representations , that is , if there is a homeomorphism @xmath22 such that @xmath23 for each @xmath24 .",
    "they are _ weakly equivalent _ if their images are conjugate , that is , if there is a homeomorphism @xmath22 so that @xmath25 .",
    "said differently , there is some automorphism @xmath26 of @xmath0 so that @xmath27 for all @xmath7 . in words ,",
    "equivalent actions are the same after a change of coordinates on the space , while weakly equivalent actions are the same after a change of coordinates on the space and possibly a change of the group by automorphism . if @xmath28 is homeomorphic to @xmath29 , then the sets of equivalence ( or weak equivalence ) classes of actions on @xmath28 and on @xmath29 can be put into correspondence using any homeomorphism from @xmath28 to @xmath29 .",
    "henceforth the term _ action _ will mean an orientation - preserving _ free _ action of a finite group on a @xmath1-dimensional orientable handlebody of genus @xmath2 ( only the trivial group can act freely on the handlebody of genus  @xmath30 , the @xmath1-ball ) .",
    "one may work with either piecewise - linear or smooth actions ; we assume that one of these categories has been chosen , and that all maps , isotopies , etc .",
    "lie in the category .    for a finite group @xmath0",
    "we denote by @xmath15 the minimum number of generators in any generating set for @xmath0 , and by @xmath9 the maximum @xmath31 such that @xmath32 is a properly descending chain of subgroups of @xmath0 .",
    "when there is only one group @xmath0 under consideration , we often write @xmath33 for  @xmath15 and @xmath31 for  @xmath9 .    fix a finite group @xmath0 , and consider an action of @xmath0 on a handlebody @xmath10 .",
    "the quotient map @xmath34 is a covering map , so the action corresponds to an extension @xmath35    a torsionfree finite extension of a finitely generated free group is free ( by  @xcite any finitely generated virtually free group is the fundamental group of a graph of groups with finite vertex groups , and if the group is torsionfree , the vertex groups must be trivial ) .",
    "so @xmath36 is free .",
    "since @xmath10 is irreducible , so is @xmath37 , and theorem  5.2 of  @xcite shows that @xmath37 is a handlebody . from equation ( @xmath38 ) , the genus of @xmath37 must be at least  @xmath33 , so its euler characteristic is at most @xmath39 .",
    "therefore the euler characteristic of @xmath10 is at most @xmath40 , and the genus of @xmath10 is at least @xmath41 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath42 is a handlebody of genus @xmath33 , we may fix any surjective homomorphism from @xmath43 to @xmath0 , and the covering space @xmath10 corresponding to its kernel has genus @xmath41 and admits an action of @xmath0 .",
    "so @xmath41 is the minimal genus among the handlebodies that admit a @xmath0-action .",
    "we denote this minimal genus by  @xmath44 , and we call an action of @xmath0 on a handlebody of genus @xmath44 a _ minimal genus action . _    if @xmath10 is any handlebody that admits a @xmath0-action , then the genus of @xmath37 is @xmath45 for some integer @xmath46 , so the genus of @xmath10 is @xmath47 .",
    "denote by @xmath48 the set of equivalence classes of actions of @xmath0 on a handlebody of genus @xmath47 , and by @xmath49 the set of weak equivalence classes .",
    "in particular , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the equivalence classes of minimal genus actions .",
    "there is a natural surjection from @xmath48 to  @xmath49 . in the introduction we explained that an action of @xmath0 on @xmath10 is a stabilization of an action on @xmath11 if and only if there is a @xmath0-equivariant imbedding of @xmath11 into @xmath10 such that @xmath12 consists of @xmath13-handles .",
    "we now give a more convenient description . for @xmath0 acting on @xmath10 , choose a disc @xmath52 which is disjoint from all of its @xmath0-translates .",
    "attach a @xmath13-handle @xmath53 to @xmath10 using an orientation - reversing imbedding @xmath54 . for each @xmath24",
    "attach a @xmath13-handle to @xmath55 using the imbedding @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath0-action on @xmath10 extends to an action of @xmath0 on the union of @xmath10 with these @xmath13-handles , and this action is called an _ elementary stabilization _ of the original action .",
    "alternatively , we may think of this as attaching a @xmath13-handle to a disc in the boundary of @xmath37 and extending the homomorphism @xmath57 that determines the action in the exact sequence @xmath58 to a homomorphism from @xmath59 to @xmath0 by sending the generator of @xmath60 to  @xmath13 .",
    "since any two discs in @xmath61 are isotopic , and any orientation - reversing imbeddings of @xmath62 into a disc are isotopic , the equivalence class of the resulting action is well - defined .",
    "the result of applying some number of elementary stabilizations is called a _ stabilization _ of the original action . for each @xmath46 and @xmath63",
    ", stabilization gives well - defined functions from @xmath48 to @xmath64 and from @xmath49 to @xmath65 .",
    "let @xmath66 denote the cardinality of @xmath48 , and @xmath67 the cardinality of  @xmath49 .",
    "clearly  @xmath68 , and @xmath69 for @xmath46 .",

    ", however , the underlying topology of an equivalence between the stablizations of two inequivalent actions can be surprisingly complicated .",
    "figure  [ fig : actions ] gives the steps of a visualization of an explicit equivalence between two actions of the cyclic group @xmath100 of order  @xmath101 on the handlebody of genus  @xmath102 which are the stabilizations of inequivalent actions of @xmath100 on the solid torus ( the classification of the actions of cyclic groups is detailed in corollary  [ coro : cyclic actions ] ) .",

    "if @xmath347 generates @xmath483 , then @xmath484 must act by inverting each element of @xmath482 ( otherwise it would act trivially , but then the centralizer of an element of @xmath438 would be larger than @xmath438 , contradicting lemma  [ lem : centralizers ] ) so @xmath485 has order  @xmath16 for any @xmath486 . since @xmath475 and @xmath469",
