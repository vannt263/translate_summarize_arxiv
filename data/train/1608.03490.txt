    "thanks to high crystal quality , relatively simple conduction band structures , and very good tunability between various electronic states , organic charge transfer salts can often serve as model systems for studying correlated electron physics , see , e.g. , @xcite for a review .",
    "in particular , the family of bis(ethylenedithio)tetraselenafulvalene ( bets ) salts containing transition - metal ions like fe3 + , mn2 + , cu2 + , etc . represents perfect natural nanostructures with alternating single - molecular conducting and magnetic layers . the charge transport in such compounds is provided by delocalized @xmath3-electrons of fractionally charged bets donors , whereas magnetic properties are dominated by localized @xmath4-electron spins in the insulating anionic layers .",
    "while the latter usually undergo antiferromagnetic ( af ) ordering at low temperatures , the ground state of the @xmath3-electron system is determined by a subtle balance between different instabilities of the normal metallic state and is particularly sensitive to the interlayer @xmath3-@xmath4 exchange interaction @xcite .",
    "in the best - studied member of this family , @xmath5-(bets)@xmath1fecl@xmath2 , the low - temperature metal - insulator transition is triggered by the af ordering in the anionic layers @xcite .",
    "moreover , at high magnetic fields where the af insulating state is suppressed @xcite , the @xmath3-@xmath4 interaction leads , via the jaccarino - peter compensation effect @xcite to a fascinating field - induced superconducting ( sc ) state @xcite . in the @xmath0-(bets)@xmath1fex@xmath2 ( m = cl ,",
    "br ) salts , differing from the former by the structure of the bets layers , the @xmath3-@xmath4 interaction is weaker . as a result , they preserve metallic properties and even become sc below the nel temperature @xcite",
    ". however , the magnetic interactions remain very important , as seen , for instance , in the high - field re - entrant superconductivity in the x = br salt @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show a few examples illustrating the entanglement of the magnetic and conducting systems in @xmath0-(bets)@xmath1febr@xmath2 . in sec.[pd ]",
    "we present data on the low - temperature phase diagram at ambient pressure as well as under high quasi - hydrostatic pressure .",
    "in addition to already known effects , we report on some new results revealing the influence of the magnetic system on the ground state of conduction electrons and vice versa . in sec.[mqo ] magnetoresistance quantum oscillations are presented . here",
    "we focus on the effect of the zeeman splitting on the oscillation behaviour , which provides quantitative information on the strength of the @xmath3-@xmath4 coupling , but also shows some unexpected features .",
    "crystals of @xmath0-(bets)@xmath1febr@xmath2 were grown electrochemically @xcite and had the form of rhombic platelets of submillimiter size and the largest surface parallel to the conducting bets layers , that is the crystallographic @xmath6-plane .",
    "the interlayer ( @xmath7 @xmath8-axis ) resistance was measured by standard 4-terminal a.c .",
    "technique using a low - frequency lock - in amplifier .",
    "high - pressure measurements were done in a be - cu piston - cylinder clamp cell with a silicon - organic liquid gkzh as pressure medium .",
    "the room- and low-@xmath9 pressure values were evaluated from the resistance of a calibrated manganin coil .",
    "magnetoresistance measurements were done at ambient pressure in magnetic fields up to 14 t .",
    "the samples were mounted on a holder allowing in - situ rotation of the sample around an axis perpendicular to the external field direction .",
    "the orientation of the crystal was defined by a polar angle @xmath10 between the field and the crystallographic @xmath8-axis ( normal to conducting layers ) .",
    "the coupling between the magnetic and conduction systems is most evidently manifested in the sc properties of @xmath0(bets)@xmath1febr@xmath2 . in fig.[rba ] we plot examples of interlayer resistance traces in a magnetic field aligned in the conducting layers , parallel to the crystallographic @xmath11-axis .",
    "this direction coincides with the easy magnetization axis of the @xmath4-electron spins @xcite .     of @xmath0-(bets)@xmath1febr@xmath2 as a function of magnetic field applied parallel to the inplane @xmath11-axis , which is the easy magnetization axis in this system .",
    "low - field ( below 2 t ) and high - field ( @xmath12 t ) sc regions are clearly seen .",
    "the inset shows the low - field region in a larger scale , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    two sc regions are clearly seen , one below @xmath13 t and the other at high fields , @xmath14 t at the lowest temperature .",
    "the latter is known @xcite as field - induced or , here maybe better , re - entrant superconductivity .",
    "while in the present data the resistance does not completely vanish , a full re - entrant sc transition has been observed at lower temperatures , @xmath15k @xcite . from the position of the center of the sc",
    "dip one can estimate the effective exchange field imposed on the conduction @xmath3-electron spins by the localized @xmath4-electron spins aligned in the field direction , @xmath16 t ( the `` @xmath17 '' sign indicates the af interaction ) , in perfect agreement with the earlier reports @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the exchange coupling energy @xmath18mev , where we plugged in the fe@xmath19 electron spin @xmath20 @xcite and assumed the @xmath21-factor equal to 2.0 ( @xmath22 is the bohr magneton ) .",
    "this value is quite small ; nevertheless , as we see , this interaction has a strong impact on the electronic state .",
    "the low - field sc transition is also affected by the @xmath3-@xmath4 interaction . as the applied field increases from zero",
    ", the resistance gradually increases , indicating that the material is in the resistive flux - flow regime .",
    "however , at a certain field a sharp jump to the normal - state resistance value is observed .",
    "most clearly it is seen in the 0.5 and 0.6k curves in fig.[rba ] .",
    "this jump has been associated with a transition of the fe spin system from the af to a paramagnetic ( pm ) state @xcite . since the external field @xmath23",
    "is applied along the easy axis , the fe spins are aligned alternately parallel and antiparallel to @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the average exchange field on the @xmath3-electron spins is zero .",
    "the total effective field @xmath24 is simply equal to the applied field , which is not strong enough to kill superconductivity .",
    "as soon , as the af order is broken , the majority of fe spins turns parallel to @xmath23 , creating a strong exchange field @xmath25 t .",
    "therefore the effective field on @xmath3 spins sharply increases , causing a destruction of superconductivity by the pauli paramagnetic pair - breaking mechanism .",
    "the described scenario explains simultaneous suppression of the af order in the magnetic system and of the sc order in the conducting system .",
    "however , konoike et al .",
    "have reported resistive @xcite and magnetic torque @xcite data suggesting that the two transitions , while being close to each other , do not exactly coincide , at least at the lowest temperatures .",
    "a possible explanation is that at low temperatures the af state undergoes a spin - flop transition before being completely destroyed by magnetic field .",
    "if so , the fe spins acquire a finite average component in the field direction .",
    "if this component is strong enough , it creates an exchange field sufficient to suppress superconductivity in the bets layers .",
    "we have carefully inspected the resistive behaviour at @xmath26 and found only one single transition down to @xmath27k , as shown in the inset in fig.[rba ] .",
    "thus , if the transition splits in two , it happens at lower temperatures .",
    "-(bets)@xmath1febr@xmath2 in magnetic field parallel to the easy axis .",
    "circles and stars correspond to the af and sc transitions , respectively , recorded at zero pressure .",
    "the hollow symbols have been plotted according to konoike et al .",
    "squares show the transition points taken from temperature ( hollow symbols ) and field ( solid symbols ) sweeps at @xmath28kbar .",
    "the lines are guides to the eye , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in fig.[pda ] we summarize the data on the @xmath9-dependent af and ( low - field ) sc critical fields from konoike et al .",
    "@xcite ( hollow symbols ) along with those determined in this work ( solid symbols ) ; we now consider the zero - pressure data .",
    "one can see that the very steep , @xmath29t / k , initial slope of the sc phase boundary near @xmath30 is interrupted exactly when it meets the af phase boundary . between @xmath31 and @xmath32k",
    "both phase lines coincide . at",
    "lower @xmath9 the af critical field seems to increase slightly above the sc one . as noted above , the narrow region between the critical fields may be a canted af ( caf ) phase .",
    "however , more thorough experiments are necessary to verify this .",
    "fig.[pda ] also shows the phase diagram obtained under hydrostatic pressure , @xmath28kbar .",
    "superconductivity is rapidly suppressed by pressure , which is usual for organic superconductors @xcite . according to otsuka et al .",
    "@xcite , the critical pressure for superconductivity is 4kbar . in our measurements already at 2kbar no trace of a sc transition has been found down to 0.42k .",
    "by contrast to superconductivity , the af ordering is enhanced under pressure .",
    "the zero - field nel temperature increases by @xmath33 from the ambient pressure value , qualitatively in agreement with the earlier report @xcite .",
    "this is obviously caused by an enhancement of the exchange interactions due to compression of the crystal lattice .",
    "in addition to the kink feature around 2 t , a clear second feature has been detected in the @xmath34-dependent resistance at @xmath35k .",
    "the positions of both kinks are plotted in fig.[pda ] ( squares ) .",
    "the behaviour resembles that observed on the isostructural sister compound @xmath0(bets)@xmath1fecl@xmath2 ( @xmath0-cl salt ) at ambient pressure @xcite . in the @xmath0-cl salt this behavior",
    "was associated with a spin - flop transition into an intermediate , caf state .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the same happens in the present @xmath0(bets)@xmath1febr@xmath2 salt under pressure .    comparing to the present compound , in @xmath0-cl the caf phase occupies a significant part of the ambient - pressure phase diagram @xcite .",
    "the difference stems from different relative contributions of the direct @xmath4-@xmath4 exchange and indirect rkky exchange , involving the @xmath3-@xmath4 and @xmath3-@xmath3 coupling , in setting the af order . in @xmath0(bets)@xmath1febr@xmath2",
    "the ordering is predicted to be strongly dominated by the direct exchange , whereas in the @xmath0-cl salt the indirect interactions play a considerable role @xcite .",
    "the delocalized @xmath3-electrons provide much more isotropic interactions in the plane of conducting layers than the @xmath4-electrons localized in the insulating layers .",
    "therefore the magnetic anisotropy of the @xmath0-cl salt is weaker , favouring a spin - flop from the easy @xmath11-axis to the next - easy inplane @xmath36-axis at @xmath26 .",
    "turning to our salt , we can speculate that high pressure leads to a stronger enhancement of the indirect exchange , thus facilitating the spin flop transition and making the caf phase more stable .",
    "this looks reasonable , since the conduction electrons in organic metals are known to be extremely sensitive to pressure @xcite .",
    "the influence of the magnetic system on the normal - state charge carriers can be probed by magnetic quantum oscillations .",
    "fig.[sdh ] shows an example of oscillating resistance ( shubnikov - de haas , sdh oscillations ) in a field perpendicular to conducting layers , @xmath37 .     layers , @xmath38k .",
    "( b ) two - dimensional fermi surface consisting of a closed part on the border of the brillouin zone and a pair of open sheets along @xmath39 , according to kobayashi et al . @xcite .",
    "the classical ( @xmath40 ) and magnetic - breakdown ( @xmath41 ) orbits are shown .",
    "( c ) fft spectrum of the sdh oscillations in the field window 9 to 14 t .",
    "( d ) amplitude of the @xmath40-oscillations plotted against inverse field .",
    "the dashed line is the best fit using the standard theory @xcite , yielding the dingle temperature @xmath42k , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the af ordering is reflected in the behaviour of the oscillations as well as in the nonoscillating magnetoresistance component . in fig.[sdh ]",
    "one can distinguish two different magnetoresistance regimes corresponding to the af ( @xmath43 t ) and pm ( @xmath44 ) states , respectively , in agreement with earlier findings @xcite .",
    "the sdh oscillations also differ drastically in these two regimes . in the pm state",
    "the oscillations originate from the classical @xmath40 and magnetic - breakdown ( mb ) @xmath41 orbits on the fermi surface predicted by the tight - binding band structure calculations @xcite , see fig.[sdh](b ) . in fig.[sdh](c ) we show the fast fourier transform ( fft ) spectrum consisting of the fundamental harmonics , @xmath45 t and @xmath46 t , and their combinations @xcite . by contrast , in the af state only low - frequency oscillations , @xmath47 t , are observed , indicating a fermi surface reconstruction caused by the ordering @xcite .",
    "moreover , even in the high - field pm state the sdh oscillations are affected by the @xmath3-@xmath4 coupling , providing a basis for its quantitative evaluation . in usual metals without magnetic interactions",
    ", the zeeman splitting leads to a phase shift between oscillations corresponding to spins parallel and antiparallel to the applied field .",
    "this gives rise to a field - independent spin damping factor @xcite , which in the case of a strongly anisotropic layered metal has the form : @xmath48 , where @xmath21 is the land @xmath21-factor , @xmath10 is the angle between the magnetic field and the normal to conducting layers ( in our case the @xmath8-axis ) , and @xmath49 the relevant cyclotron mass expressed in units of the free electron mass .",
    "however , when a constant internal field @xmath50 is imposed on the conduction electrons , the spin factor becomes field dependent @xcite : @xmath51\\ , , \\label{rs}\\ ] ] giving rise to periodic beats in the sdh amplitude with the frequency : @xmath52    in fig.[sdh](c ) the fft peaks containing the mb frequency @xmath53 are split .",
    "cpas et al .",
    "@xcite were the first to suggest that the splitting @xmath54 t comes from beating caused by the field - dependent spin factor in eq.([rs ] ) .",
    "indeed , the beat frequency , @xmath55 , yields a reasonable value of the exchange field , @xmath56 t , if we substitute @xmath57 , @xmath58 @xcite and @xmath59 ( as @xmath60 layers ) .",
    "the problem , however , is that while the @xmath41 peak in the sdh spectrum reproducibly shows splitting @xcite , no splitting has been reported for the @xmath40-oscillations . in our measurements",
    "no sign of modulation of the @xmath40-oscillation amplitude has been found in the field window 5.5 to 14 t .",
    "this can bee seen from fig.[sdh](d ) where the amplitude @xmath61 is plotted against inverse field , revealing a monotonic exponential dependence . fitting it with the standard formula for the field - dependent oscillation amplitude yields the dingle temperature ( a quantity characterizing the scatttering rate , @xmath62 @xcite ) @xmath63k . according to eq.([fbeat ] ) , the absence of a minimum in the oscillation amplitude in the interval between 5.5 and 14 t would correspond to the exchange field being smaller than 0.9 t ( the cyclotron mass @xmath64 @xcite was used for the estimation ) .",
    "this controversy calls for a more thorough investigation of the effect of magnetic interactions on the sdh oscillations .",
    "-oscillatory component of the magnetoresistance measured at @xmath65k at different polar angles @xmath10 .",
    "the curves are vertically shifted for clarity .",
    "the vertical line indicates the field , at which the high - angle oscillations show a maximum : @xmath66 , according to eq.([rs]),scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to this end we have carried out experiments at different orientations of magnetic field .",
    "figure [ beta ] shows the @xmath41-oscillating component of magnetoresistance measured at different polar angles @xmath10 .",
    "one clearly sees beats with the maxima and minima of the oscillation amplitude changing with @xmath10 . considering the beats as coming from the field - dependent spin factor , the first , obvious feature following from eq.([rs ] ) is that for @xmath67 the oscillation amplitude must always be at maximum , independently of the angle . for @xmath68",
    "the behaviour is consistent with eq.([rs ] ) , showing the @xmath10-independent maximum position at @xmath69 t .",
    "however , for small tilt angles , @xmath70 , the beats become more complex .",
    "not only some of the beat nodes become much less pronounced but also their positions shift in an apparently irregular manner .",
    "for example , at @xmath71 a minimum in the amplitude is found around 13 t , the field where the main ( @xmath10-independent ) maximum should be expected .    using the condition for zeros of the spin factor @xmath72 determined by eq.([rs ] )",
    ", one can fit the positions of the amplitude minima / nodes with the exchange field and @xmath21-factor as fitting parameters .",
    "-@xmath4 exchange field and @xmath21-factor obtained from fitting the positions of the sdh amplitude zeros / minima using eq.([rs]),scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the results of such fitting are shown in fig.[bj&g ] . in line with what was qualitatively described above , at @xmath73",
    "the obtained values , @xmath74 t and @xmath75 , are very reasonable and consistent with the estimation based on the position of the re - entrant superconductivity region of the phase diagram , see sec .",
    "[ sc ] . at lower tilt angles",
    "both fitting parameters strongly deviate from these values . at present",
    "we do not have a satisfactory explanation of this anomalous behaviour .",
    "one might appeal to other possible mechanisms of beating of the sdh oscillations have to be taken in consideration , such as weak warping of the fermi surface in the interlayer direction @xcite or mosaicity of the crystal .    as noted above , the @xmath40-oscillations corresponding to the smaller , classical orbit in fig.[sdh](b ) should also be modulated by the field - dependent spin factor .",
    "however , we have found no modulation at tilt angles below 15 - 20@xmath76 , i.e. in the range where the beat behaviour of the @xmath41-oscillations is also anomalous . in fig.[alpha ] we show the evolution of the @xmath40-oscillating component at @xmath68 .",
    "-oscillatory component of the magnetoresistance measured at @xmath65k at different polar angles @xmath10 .",
    "the curves are vertically shifted for clarity .",
    "crosses indicate the positions of the amplitude minima expected from the analysis of the @xmath41-oscillations ; arrows point to the actual minima positions , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the weak modulation observed at 20@xmath76 develops gradually into full beating with periodic nodes .",
    "however , the node positions are still inconsistent with those found on the @xmath41-oscillations .",
    "as shown in fig.[alpha ] , apparently only every second expected node shows up in the experiment .",
    "according to eq.([rs ] ) , this would imply that the @xmath21-factor on the @xmath40 orbit is only one half of that on the @xmath41 orbit",
    ". this would be highly surprising , especially since the latter does incorporate the @xmath40 orbit as a part .",
    "thus , further angle - resolved studies are needed to clarify the situation .",
    "perhaps low-@xmath9 esr measurements will give a clue to the puzzle .",
    "the localized @xmath4-electron spins of fe@xmath19 ions , responsible for magnetic properties , and itinerant electrons originating from the @xmath3 orbitals of bets molecules are spatially separated in the layered organic metal @xmath0-(bets)@xmath1febr@xmath2 .",
    "the exchange interaction between the two systems is weak , @xmath77mev .",
    "nevertheless this interaction has strong impact on the electronic properties .",
    "the role of @xmath3-@xmath4 interaction is very clearly manifested in the high - field re - entrance superconductivity @xcite , but also in the low - field superconductivity , which turns out to be `` protected '' by the af ordering and disappear simultaneously with the latter at low temperatures . in the normal state , the @xmath3-@xmath4 coupling is reflected in the angle - dependent beating behaviour of magnetic quantum oscillations . at",
    "sufficiently strongly tilted field , @xmath78 , the beats of the magnetic - breakdown @xmath41-oscillations can be quantitatively accounted for by including the exchange field @xmath79 t in the spin damping factor @xmath72 for the oscillation amplitude . however , at lower tilt angles the beat positions are surprisingly shifted , resulting in an apparently strong changes in both @xmath80 and the @xmath21-factor .",
    "this anomaly as well as the unexpected difference between the beats of the @xmath41- and @xmath40-oscillations require further investigation .    finally , the conduction system in its turn seems to influence the magnetic ordering of the @xmath4-electron spins through the indirect rkky exchange .",
    "this is reflected in the change of the shape of the phase diagram and appearance of the spin - flopped af phase under pressure .",
    "it would be nice to perform magnetic measurements under pressure in order to determine the exact nature of the high - field af phase .",
