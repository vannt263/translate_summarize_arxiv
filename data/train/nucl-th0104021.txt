    "with the start of rhic operation  @xcite new data are now available for high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "this makes it possible to contrast the models to the experimental data and to learn about new effects in this so far unreachable domain .    in this talk",
    "we discuss the features of some hadronic spectra in au+au collisions at 130 gev .",
    "first we give an introduction to the pqcd - improved parton model and fix our parameters in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "next , we study the available @xmath4 experiments in order to understand the nuclear ( cronin ) effect , the enhancement of particle production in a certain @xmath1 range compared to @xmath2 collisons .",
    "finally , we present our calculation for nucleus - nucleus ( @xmath8 ) collisions at present rhic energy .",
    "the classical pqcd parton model assumes factorization of the hadron ( meson @xmath9 ) production cross section , namely , the particle production is interpreted as a superposition of elementary , partonic collisions  @xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the parton distribution function ( pdf ) , i.e. the probability of finding parton @xmath12 in the proton with momentum fraction @xmath13 at transverse momentum scale @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the pqcd calculable cross section of quarks and gluons , while @xmath16 is the fragmentation function ( ff ) of parton @xmath17 into a meson @xmath9 with the meson carrying a momentum fraction @xmath18 of the parton at transverse momentum scale @xmath19 . the pdf and ff , contain all the non - perturbative information and are fixed by experimental data . in our calculation we use the leading order grv  @xcite pdf and the leading order kkp  @xcite ff .",
    "( we also carried out approximate nlo calculations  @xcite ) .",
    "evaluating integral  ( [ eq - kt0 ] ) numerically and comparing it to existing experimental data of charged and neutral pion and kaon production in @xmath2 and @xmath20 reactions in the range of @xmath21 gev we found a factor of two discrepancy with the theory underestimating the yield .",
    "even more sophisticated nlo calculations failed to reproduce the pion spectra  @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to introduce another non - perturbative parameter , the intrinsic transverse momentum of partons .",
    "such a quantity is not fictitious : it has been measured experimentally  @xcite .",
    "we consider the distribution of this intrinsic transverse momentum to be gaussian for simplicity , and fix its width from experiments .",
    "the integral for both incoming partons in eq .",
    "( [ eq - kt0 ] ) is modified to @xmath22 the fit of the intrinsic transverse momentum width is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - kt ] for pions .",
    "a similar plot may be obtained for kaons ( with much less experimental data available ) . using the intrinsic transverse momentum distribution with a width given by the figure we were able to fit @xmath2 experimental data within 30% for @xmath23 gev .    ,",
    "for scaled @xmath2 collision ( dotted line ) and central au+au collisions at 130 gev ( solid line ) in @xmath24 production.,height=283 ]    , for scaled @xmath2 collision ( dotted line ) and central au+au collisions at 130 gev ( solid line ) in @xmath24 production.,height=283 ]    having fitted the @xmath2 data using eqs .",
    "( [ eq - kt0]-[eq - kt ] ) parameterized by the @xmath25 values , we now turn to the @xmath4 collisions .",
    "it was found in experiments that there is an extra nuclear enhancement in @xmath4 collisions compared to the simple scaling of @xmath2 data in a certain @xmath1 range ( cronin effect )  @xcite .",
    "one needs to extend integral  ( [ eq - kt0]-[eq - kt ] ) as @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the nuclear thickness function at impact parameter @xmath28 , @xmath29 and the nucleon - nucleon cross section has a dependence on the width of intrinsic transverse momentum of the proton and nucleons in nuclei @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , due to the nuclear environment the partonic distribution functions are modified with a shadowing and antishadowing region  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical interpretation of the cronin effect is related to the nuclear environment , the average intrinsic transverse momentum of a parton increases due to multiscattering , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the number of target nucleons in the channel swept by the incoming proton at impact parameter @xmath28 , @xmath33 is an `` effectivity '' function , selecting the number of target nucleons contributing to the @xmath34 enhancement of the projectile and @xmath35 is the average momentum square imparted in one nucleon - nucleon collision .    for the effectivity function we tried a function linearly rising with the number of particles inside the channel and saturating after @xmath36 collisions . requiring approximate",
    "target and energy independence of @xmath33 we found that the best fit is achieved using @xmath37 with average momentum square impart @xmath38 gev@xmath39 . in the following we use this value for central nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "next , we performed a simulation of the ongoing rhic experiments on meson production at @xmath7130 gev in au+au collisions .",
    "this requires a modification of eq .",
    "( [ eq - pa ] ) extending it to the case of two colliding nuclei , @xmath40 based on fig .",
    "[ fig - kt ] we used @xmath41 gev@xmath39 .",
    "a simple calculation without the nuclear enhancement and shadowing agrees well with the peripheral phenix results on @xmath42 production  @xcite .",
    "however , for central collisions there is a disagreement between this pqcd model and the experimental data , indicating a strong suppression in the particle production .",
    "a possible candidate explaining this phenomenon is jet quenching  @xcite .    an interesting quantity to study is the slope of the meson production cross section . for peripheral collisions ( no shadowing and nuclear enhancement )",
    "a pqcd calculation yields a non - exponential spectrum with a slope parameter rising with the transverse momentum ( fig .",
    "[ fig - t ] dotted line ) .",
    "however , in case of central collisions in a @xmath1 window 23.5 gev the slope parameter is almost constant resembling an exponential ( thermal ) spectrum .",
    "predictions for lower transverse momentum are uncontrollable within pqcd .",
    "our studies show that at sps energies this plateau is more pronounced and extends to the highest transverse momenta measured .",
    "in this talk we showed that at high transverse momenta ( @xmath23 gev ) pqcd augmented with an intrinsic transverse momentum distribution of the partons gives a good description of @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath8 collisions .",
    "a `` thermal '' slope is observed in central @xmath8 collisions in a transverse momentum window 23.5 gev despite the non - thermal character of the model . at rhic energies , however ,",
    "a strong suppression is observed in hadron production in central collisions compared to pqcd calculations .",
    "a possible explanation is presented in  @xcite .",
