    "thermally activated fluorescence ( tadf ) is seen as a strategy for improving oled efficiency by harvesting excitation energy from slowly relaxing phosphorescent states via reverse intersystem crossing ( risc ) to faster relaxing , more efficient singlet states .",
    "@xcite materials engineered to implement tadf have been reported to achieve as high as 100% internal quantum efficiency with large reverse crossing rates and low singlet - triplet energy gaps.@xcite yet , singlet / triplet ratios and relaxation rates are determined by at least four parameters comprising the individual relaxation rates and intersystem crossing rates .",
    "direct observation of these rates has been considered difficult.@xcite    singlet - triplet energy gaps have been obtained from the temperature dependence of reverse crossing rates where the reverse rates are calculated from prompt and delayed yields and decay rates and a supplied value for the forward crossing rate.@xcite in this work we describe a method for finding the singlet and triplet relaxation rate constants , the forward and reverse intersystem crossing rate constants , and the singlet - triplet energy gap and prefactor governing the reverse intersystem crossing rate constant , using only the temperature dependent decay rates .",
    "the ratio of fluorescence to phosphorescence , and the ratio of singlets to triplets , in steady state electroluminescence and phototransients , can then be calculated from the four primary rate constants .    in section  [ sec : tadf ] , we model the system in a pair of linear differential equations which we solve to obtain the steady state behavior , and the time dependent behavior following from a short photoexcitation into the singlet . then in section",
    "[ sec : analysis ] , we apply our model to re - analyze published tadf data for two materials to recover their primary relaxation and crossing rates and the reversing crossing parameters .",
    "the results are found to be in agreement with reported values where available and consistent with observed behaviors .",
    "we consider behaviors in two regimes , continuously driven systems as in electroluminescence , and transient luminescence as follows from photoexcitation by a subnanosecond laser pulse .",
    "closed form solutions are found for both regimes in terms of four primary rates : relaxation from the singlet and from the triplet , and forward and reverse intersystem crossing .",
    "temperature dependence , scaled by the singlet - triplet gap energy , enters through the thermally activated reverse crossing rate and provides a route to extract the primary parameters from empirical decay rates .",
    "electroluminescence occurs when charge carriers ( electrons and holes ) are combined onto a site where they form an excited state that can decay and emit light.@xcite charge carriers arrive with random spin and so a mixed population of singlet and triplet excited states is formed , as illustrated in fig .",

    "the temperature dependence of the emergent rate constants provides an opportunity to obtain the four primary rate constants along with singlet - triplet energy gap and prefactor discussed above .",

    "eigenvectors can be found as @xmath49 or alternatively , @xmath50 general solutions , using either set of eigenvectors , are @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are chosen to satisfy initial conditions .",
    "the two emergent rate constants are thus shared by the singlet and the triplet .",
    "following excitation with a fast laser pulse at or above the singlet absorption , we expect an initial configuration @xmath54 . choosing the first option for our eigenvectors and applying the initial condition on the triplet we obtain @xmath55 where @xmath56 . substituting this into , we obtain @xmath57    \\frac{n_3}{c_2 } & =    \\left [ \\kd + \\frac{\\kisc\\krisc}{\\kd}\\right]\\left ( \\e^{r_2 t } - \\e^{r_1 t } \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] during the time @xmath58 , the triplet population ramps up while the singlet decays , both at @xmath47 , and then at some time @xmath59 both the singlet and triplet decay slowly at the shared rate @xmath48 .",
    "the delayed luminescence therefore has a constant ratio of fluorescence and phosphorescence , @xmath60 ( apart from a factor of @xmath61 ) .    with a minor simplification ,",

    "note the second exponential in which appears both @xmath73 , and the exponential temperature dependence .",
    "in other words , the expected relationship between yield and temperature seen in the first term is modified by the combined temperature and time dependence seen in the second exponential term .",
    "this presents additional complications for measurement and for data reduction and fitting , compared to the rate - constant - only method described above .    in fig .",

    "this completes our model and closed form solutions for steady state and transient luminescence in a three level tadf system .",
    "delayed fluorescence transients , as we have shown , are characterized by a fast ( prompt ) rate constant @xmath47 and a slow ( delayed ) rate constant @xmath48 . here",
    "we describe a method for obtaining @xmath14 , @xmath10 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath70 from @xmath47 and @xmath48 measured at several temperatures , and a second method by which @xmath70 and the prefactor @xmath36 are obtained from @xmath68 .",
    "we then apply the methods to data published for two tadf materials and calculate the fluorescence / phosphorescence and singlet / triplet ratios using equation and equation .",
    "we can write equation for @xmath48 , as @xmath84 provided that @xmath85 is nearly constant , or equivalently that @xmath86 which will generally be true since @xmath87 . fitting delayed decay rate data measured at several temperatures ( c.f .",

    "the modest singlet / triplet ratios produce large flourescence / phosphorescence ratios because of the large @xmath80 ratios .",
    "high efficiency reported in oleds using these materials likely originates in competition between reverse crossing and losses in the triplet .",

    "since the magnitude of the scatter ( as well as on a percentage basis ) is greater at the faster decay rate , the scatter might be related to gate timing as described above .",
