    "this prescription is examined by the single - channel scattering model with one resonance in sec .",
    "[ subsec : example ] .",
    "let us consider an isolated resonance state in a single - channel scattering .",
    "as demonstrated in appendix  [ appendix : resonancewf ] , the property of the resonance is reflected in a finite - volume eigenstate when the eigenenergy is close to the resonance energy .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to consider @xmath91 as the compositeness of the resonance , when the eigenenergy @xmath92 is near the resonance energy .",
    "dependence of @xmath49 and @xmath65 explicitly . ]    the resonance energy @xmath93 in infinite volume should however be defined carefully .",
    "first of all , @xmath93 can not be uniquely determined , because the finite decay width of the resonance represents the uncertainty of the energy measurement .",
    "we thus consider the following energy region @xmath94 and regard the states satisfying this as the resonance .",
    "next , there are two ways to determine @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "on one hand , the eigenenergy of the resonance is expressed by the pole of the scattering amplitude in the complex energy plane . in this case , we determine @xmath97 and @xmath98 , with @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) being the real ( imaginary ) part of the pole energy . on the other hand , the resonance energy can also be read off from the behavior of the scattering amplitude on the real axis . in this method , @xmath95 and @xmath96",
    "are determined by the energies at which the spectrum ( i.e. , the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude ) becomes a half of the peak value .",
    "if the resonance is isolated from other resonances and the nonresonant amplitude is small , then the resonant breit - wigner amplitude dominates so that both methods give a similar set of @xmath101 .",
    "however , this is not always the case .",
    "for instance , in the case of @xmath0 , there are two complex poles in the relevant energy region , while there is only one peak structure in the scattering amplitude on the real axis  @xcite . as shown in appendix  [",
    "appendix : fvstates ] , the finite - volume eigenenergies reflect the behavior of the phase shift on the real energy axis , rather than the poles in the complex energy plane .",
    "this suggests that the latter approach is suitable in the present purpose with the finite - volume effect to define the region of the resonance energy .",
    "namely , we determine @xmath101 from the behavior of the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude .    for a given set of @xmath101",
    ", there are many states whose eigenenergy satisfies eq .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrasingle ] in sec .",
    "[ subsec : example ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum1d ] in appendix  [ appendix : resonancewf ] ) .",
    "we thus need to consider the choice of the energy level to determine the compositeness .",
    "since the infinite - volume system corresponds to the limit @xmath102 , one may naively think that the energy level at large @xmath14 should be adopted .",
    "this is however not appropriate in practice , because the energy levels become denser and denser at large @xmath14 , and the eigenstates are largely contaminated by the scattering states . on the other hand ,",
    "when we decrease the box size @xmath14 down to the spatial extent of the wavefunction , the finite - volume effect on the wavefunction largely modifies the eigenenergy  @xcite . keeping these in mind ,",
    "let us examine each eigenstate in finite volume .",
    "the ground state @xmath103 corresponds to the threshold energy @xmath104 , and does not usually satisfy eq .  .",
    "the eigenenergy of the first excited state @xmath105 can satisfy eq .",
    ", when @xmath14 is larger than the spatial extent of the wavefunction and smaller than the region where the eigenenergy is affected by the lowest scattering state with a finite momentum . for higher excited states ( @xmath106 ) , eq .",
    "is satisfied between two noninteracting scattering states .",
    "when the width of the resonance is small , there can be a region in which @xmath92 is stable against @xmath14 .",
    "but this is not always guaranteed , even for the resonance states with the decay width of several tens of mev ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : spectrasingle ] in sec .",
    "[ subsec : example ] ) .",
    "thus , we shall use the first excited state ( @xmath107 ) to determine the compositeness of the resonance . in this case",
    ", we can define the region @xmath108 , where @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) is determined by the finite - volume effect on the wavefunction ( coupling to the lowest finite energy scattering state ) .",
    "of course , the value of @xmath111 changes within the region @xmath108 . because the states satisfying eq .   are considered to represent the resonance state , we average @xmath111 over the region @xmath108 in order to determine the compositeness of the resonance .    in summary , we propose the following procedure to define the compositeness of the resonance .    *",
    "determine @xmath95 and @xmath96 by the energies at which the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in infinite volume becomes a half of the peak value . *",
    "determine @xmath109 by the lower boundary where the eigenenergy of the first excited state @xmath105 does not satisfy @xmath112 due to the finite - volume effect on the wavefunction .",
    "* determine @xmath110 by the upper boundary where the eigenenergy of the first excited state @xmath105 does not satisfy eq .",
    "due to the coupling to the lowest finite energy scattering state .",
    "* average @xmath111 in the region @xmath113 to determine the resonance compositeness @xmath114 as @xmath115    some comments are in order .",
    "first , because @xmath111 is always real and positive , so is @xmath114 .",
    "in addition , because @xmath116 is satisfied at an arbitrary @xmath14 , we obtain the relation @xmath117 with @xmath118 namely , @xmath114 and @xmath119 can be interpreted as probabilities .",
    "second , to determine the compositeness in the above prescription , we need a theoretical model to describe the scattering amplitude . in this sense",
    ", it is important to prepare a successful model for the relevant scattering process . in general",
    ", there are two approaches to study the compositeness of hadrons .",
    "one is to use the weak - binding relation and its generalizations  @xcite , and the other is to evaluate the compositeness at the pole position  @xcite . in the former approach ,",
    "the compositeness is determined model - independently by the experimental observables , but the higher order terms in the near - threshold expansion provide some uncertainty of the result , and the applicability is limited to the near - threshold states .",
    "the latter approach determines the compositeness of any resonances without suffering from the higher order terms , but the result depends on the scattering model employed .",
    "the present procedure has similarity with the latter approach because of the use of the theoretical model of the scattering , although the compositeness is not evaluated in the complex energy plane .",
    "third , we should keep in mind that there is no clear definition of the structure of an unstable particle .",
    "as in previous attempts  @xcite , the above prescription is _ not _ an approximation of some true value of the compositeness .",
    "rather , we propose a new plausible definition of the compositeness which can be interpreted as a probability .",
    "if the width of the resonance is too large , the present framework may not work , because of the ambiguity of the definition of the energy region  .",
    "this is not a limitation of the framework ; it simply indicates that the `` structure '' of the resonance state with a broad width is not well defined .",
    "it is natural to expect that the compositeness is well defined only for a sufficiently narrow resonance which has a localized wavefunction ( see appendix  [ appendix : resonancewf ] ) .",
    "let us examine the above prescription by calculating the compositeness of resonances in a single - channel scattering model .",
    "we consider an @xmath3-wave scattering of the particles with masses @xmath54 and @xmath120 .",
    "here we adopt the relativistic kinematics where the total energy is given by @xmath121 for a given three - momentum @xmath122 .",
    "we construct the on - shell t - matrix @xmath123 in the n / d method  @xcite , which is equivalent to the solution of the bethe - salpeter equation under the on - shell factorization : @xmath124^{-1 } .",
