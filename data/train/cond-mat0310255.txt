    "since the discovery@xcite of high temperature superconductors ( htsc ) , considerable effort has been devoted to understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of these materials at a microscopic level .",
    "although there are a large number of perovskite htsc materials , the yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath3 ( ybco6+@xmath4 ) family has a special place .",
    "it was the first superconductor discovered@xcite with a transition temperature @xmath5 above liquid nitrogen temperature with a relatively simple synthesis route .",
    "it is available in almost the entire region of the phase diagram , easily tuned by varying the oxygen content in a quasi  continuous way .",
    "thus it is appealing for probing the intrinsic properties of htscs . in the underdoped regime , a variety of crossover phenomena are observed at temperatures above @xmath5 in which various forms of spectral weight at low energies are suppressed .",
    "these phenomena are associated with the opening of a pseudogap@xcite . to help elucidate the nature of this pseudogap , it is desirable to have highly stoichiometric crystals with a high degree of crystalline order . in particular ,",
    "such samples are needed if one wants to determine whether or not the crossover behaviors are transistions smeared by disorder and/or impurities@xcite .",
    "ybco6+@xmath4 can be prepared in the whole range of oxygen content @xmath6 = 6.0 to slightly larger than 7.0 .",
    "the oxygen content affects the crystallographic structure of the material@xcite . at @xmath4=1.0 ,",
    "the crystal structure consists of a bilayer of two  dimensional ( 2d ) cuo@xmath0 planes and a single layer of one  dimensional ( 1d ) cu  o  cu chains , hereafter denoted the cuo chain layer .",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectroscopy offers a unique probe to investigate the microscopic properties of the cuo@xmath0 planes and cuo chain layers separately .",
    "in particular , the response of inequivalent sites can in principle be resolved in nmr spectra and the dynamical properties of these sites studied by nuclear relaxation .",
    "the chains are important not only because of their role as charge reservoirs and their proximity to the superconducting cuo@xmath0 planes , but also because of their low dimensionality .",
    "it is well known that charge / spin density wave(cdw / sdw ) ground states are prevalent in quasi  one dimensional systems@xcite .",
    "therefore , the chains in this system present an important opportunity for clarifying the question of whether such transitions exist in htsc .",
    "in fact this has been the subject of study in the stoichiometric compound yba@xmath0cu@xmath7o@xmath8 containing two cuo chain layers , where evidence for the presence of incommensurate cdw fluctuations , near the wave vector @xmath9 occurring below 180 k has been reported@xcite .",
    "there are a few reports on charge modulations in ybco7 as well@xcite .",
    "perhaps the most striking evidence for charge oscillations in the chains of ybco7 is provided by stm observations@xcite .",
    "the structural phase diagram of ybco6+@xmath4 has been studied in great detail ; early neutron diffraction reveal@xcite a tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition as the sample is cooled from the growth temperature , in which oxygens form 1d cuo chains and thus break the tetragonal symmetry .",
    "typically the chain ordering occurs in domains and the samples need to be mechanically detwinned in order to produce crystals with a single orientation of chains .",
    "depending on the preparation conditions and oxygen content , oxygen atoms arrange themselves in different types of ordering in the cuo chain layers .",
    "efforts to produce crystals with domains of long chains requires an understanding of oxygen ordering in the chain layer .",
    "in addition to the orthorhombic structure ( ortho  i , full chains ) at @xmath4=1.0 ( fig .",
    "[ structure ] ( ii ) ) and tetragonal phase ( t , empty chains ) at @xmath4=0.0 ( fig . [ structure ] ( iii ) ) , at least four more modified orthorhombic structures have been observed@xcite such as ortho  ii ( fig . [ structure ] ( i ) ) for 6.35 @xmath10 6+@xmath4 @xmath10 6.62 with alternating full and empty chains .",
    "there have been theoretical studies based on lattice gas models to explain the structural phase diagram of ybco6+@xmath4@xcite .",
    "these models can be shown to be equivalent to the ising model with asymmetric next nearest neighbor interactions ( asynnni model ) which use three pair potentials between oxygen atoms in cuo chain layers : @xmath11 for nearest oxygen neighbor pairs , @xmath12 for next nearest pairs connected through a cu ion and @xmath13 for those without cu in between , with the condition @xmath14 .",
    "it is the strongly repulsive interaction @xmath11 of two _ inter - chain _",
    "nearest neighbor oxygen ions which prevents the occupation of nearest neighbor oxygen sites and promotes the formation of chains .",
    "long chain segments are induced by the attractive potential @xmath12 between two _ intra - chain _ next nearest neighbor oxygen ions connected through a cu ion .",
    "alternating sequences of full and empty chains follow from the weak repulsive @xmath13 between two _ inter - chain _ next nearest neighbor oxygen ions .    in ybco6+@xmath4",
    ", @xmath5 changes from the maximum 92.5 k at optimal doping to zero for fully oxygen depleted samples@xcite .",
    "this change takes place in a nonlinear manner with a pronounced plateau at 60 k for 6.45 @xmath10 6+@xmath4 @xmath10 6.65 and a broad maximum at 92.5 k for 6.85 @xmath10 6+@xmath4 @xmath10 7.0 .",
    "these features are associated with the ortho ",
    "ii and ortho ",
    "i ordered phases , respectively .",
    "it is suggested  @xcite that this correlation has to do with charge transfer rather than with any specific @xmath5 of the ordered phases .",
    "the importance of oxygen ordering in the cuo chain layers in determining the charge transfer was first noted in a study of the time dependence of @xmath5 during room temperature annealing of quenched samples@xcite . with the oxygen content ( average occupancy of different oxygen sites ) remaining constant , the degree of oxygen ordering increased with time .",
    "this resulted in an increase in the orthorhombicity and in @xmath5 .",
    "it was shown that the rearrangement of oxygen ions in the chain layers to form longer chain segments was responsible for this increase .",
    "another experimental indication of the presence of a minimum chain length for the charge transfer to take place is the @xmath15 vs. oxygen content for small @xmath4 : @xmath15 is nearly constant for 6+@xmath166.2  @xcite .",
    "the relationship between oxygen ordering and hole concentration has been addressed@xcite theoretically by band structure calculations .",
    "chain fragments were found to be unable to transfer charge to the planes until they exceeded a critical length equal to three ( containing three cu and two o atoms ) .",
    "an alternative model combining the asynnni and the charge transfer models has also been@xcite successful in explaining the variation of @xmath5 vs. @xmath4 .",
    "here it is assumed that only the ordered phase participates in superconductivity .",
    "thus there is a minimum domain size below which no charge transfer can take place .",
    "0.1 cm    nmr experiments can be used to measure the electric field gradient ( efg ) in materials .",
    "since the efg at a nucleus depends on the symmetry of that site , the valence of the ion itself and the charge of its environment , valuable information about the electronic structure of the system under study can be obtained by such measurements ; i.e. charge transfer .",
    "however , the interpretation can be complicated if the samples are not single phase or suffer from impurities and/or disorder .",
    "there are a number of nmr reports on underdoped ybco6+@xmath4 with different oxygen contents@xcite where either the sample is not stoichiometric or suffers from oxygen inhomogeneity , powder averaging or twinning .",
    "group@xcite was the first to study the effects of oxygen ordering on the nmr properties of ybco6+@xmath4 .",
    "however , they used aligned powdered samples where the nmr resonances were broadened by non  stoichiometry and oxygen disorder . for ortho",
    " ii ordering only a partially resolved splitting of the resonance line from the cuo@xmath0 plane was observed .    with recent enhancements in crystal growth very pure and highly ordered detwinned ortho ",
    "ii crystals with large oxygen  ordered domain size have become available@xcite . to probe the intrinsic properties of the ortho ",
    "ii phase of ybco we have performed nmr experiments on highly ordered detwinned ortho ",
    "ii single crystals of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( ybco6.5 ) .",
    "we report nmr spectra and line assignments for these ortho  ii crystals together with nmr evidence pertaining to the quality of the crystals , specifically regarding the chain lengths and the lack of oxygen disorder .",
    "we also report efg parameters for different cu sites in ortho ",
    "ii structure along with an analysis regarding lattice and valence charge contributions .",
    "we will discuss the relation between oxygen ordering and charge transfer in the ortho ",
    "ii structure .",
    "it will be shown that these crystals are an extremely important disorder ",
    "free prototype of the underdoped state of htsc .",
    "single crystals of ybco6.5 were grown by a flux method using bazro@xmath1 crucibles@xcite .",
    "the crystals were first detwinned and then the oxygen content set to 6.50 during the final annealing process .",
    "the nmr properties of two such crystals used in our experiments proved to be identical to within experimental error .",
    "hence we will not distinguish between them .",
    "the crystals were 2 mm @xmath17 2.5 mm wide and @xmath18 0.1 mm thick platelets with the @xmath19axis perpendicular to the platelet and @xmath20 and @xmath21 axes parallel to the edges of the platelet .",
    "the superconducting transitions of the crystals measured by a squid magnetometer give @xmath5 = 62 k with a transition width @xmath22 = 0.6 k. x ",
    "ray diffraction measurements performed on these crystals show a three  dimensional ortho ",
    "ii oxygen ordering with long correlation lengths 148 , 430 and 58   along the @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath19 crystallographic axes , respectively@xcite .",
    "the long correlation length along the @xmath21 ( chain ) axis indicates the presence of much longer chains than have been available previously@xcite .",
    "both the large oxygen  ordered domain size and a small @xmath22 are indicative of high degree of oxygen homogeneity in these crystals .",
    "because twin boundaries promote oxygen clustering , the removal of twin boundaries was found to be essential for obtaining a highly ordered ortho  ii phase@xcite .",
    "single crystal x ",
    "ray diffraction measurements on our crystals showed at most 10% of the sample was twinned .",
    "cu nmr data were taken between 30 and 250 k and magnetic fields up to 9 t with a home built pulsed spectrometer with quadrature detection .",
    "the crystal was placed in either a pt or au rectangular coil tunable from 30 to 100 mhz .",
    "a rectangular coil was chosen to conform to the shape of the crystal and so maximize the filling factor .",
    "the onset of the superconducting transition of the sample was observed _ in situ _ at 62 k by a sharp change in the inductance of the tuned coil at zero applied magnetic field .",
    "a powder al reference sample was located in the coil adjacent to the sample to calibrate the value of the magnetic field at the sample position .",
    "the data were obtained with a standard two  pulse spin ",
    "echo sequence , with 4 @xmath23s pulse length and 30 to 40 @xmath23s pulse separation .",
    "copper nuclei have two isotopes @xmath24cu and @xmath25cu with spin @xmath26 .",
    "each isotope gives one central transition ( @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 ) and two satellites ( @xmath30 @xmath28 @xmath31 ) . to obtain the complete cu nmr spectrum of the sample we used either field or frequency sweep methods .",
    "the spectra were then constructed by superimposing the fourier transform spectra of the spin echo measured at a certain frequency or field interval .",
    "there was no attempt to correct the signal intensity for @xmath32 or frequency dependencies in frequency sweep measurements , given the latter s narrow range .",
    "although the samples are high quality , because of their small volume a significant amount of signal averaging was required to obtain a satisfactory signal to noise ( s / n ) ratio .",
    "typical @xmath24cu nmr spectra of central transitions obtained at 60 k at 75.75 mhz for the applied field parallel to the @xmath20axis ( * h*@xmath33*a * ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ spec1 ] .",
    "similar spectra were also observed for * h*@xmath33*b * containing four resonance lines but at different positions .",
    "we denote the observed lines in fig .",
    "[ spec1 ] by a , b , c and d. the spectrum for a  d resonances has also been obtained for @xmath25cu with intensities consistent with the natural abundances of the two isotopes .",
    "these four cu resonances are associated with the four inequivalent cu sites in the unit cell as expected from the ortho ",
    "ii crystal structure ( fig .",
    "[ structure](i ) ) .",
    "two lines a and c appear nearly with the same width , integrated area and relaxation rates . line b has a very long spin ",
    "lattice relaxation time ( nearly three order of magnitude longer than a and c ) and is relatively narrow compared to the rest of the lines .",
    "line d is broader compared to line a and c and has an order of magnitude longer relaxation time .",
    "it should be noted that these resonance lines are well resolved and that there appears to be no background signal under these lines .",
    "also note that a relatively long repetition time of 250 msec must be used in order not to saturate line b. most of the spectra are collected with a shorter repetition time of 25 msec in order to saturate line b which otherwise obscures line a.    -0.5 cm    line assignments will be made by comparing the local parameters of the four cu sites with those of ybco6 and ybco7 . to motivate this comparison",
    "consider the structural environmemt of each cu site .",
    "ii ybco consists of alternating full and empty chains ( see fig .  [ structure](i ) ) and hence there are two inequivalent cu sites in cuo chain layers , one in full cu(1f ) and one in empty cu(1e ) chains .",
    "correspondingly there are two inequivalent cu sites in the cuo@xmath0 planes , adjacent to full and empty chains cu(2f ) and cu(2e ) , respectively . comparing the crystal structure of ortho ",
    "ii with that of ybco7 ( fig .",
    "[ structure](ii ) ) , one concludes that the local structural environments of cu(2f ) and cu(1f ) are similar to that of cu(2 ) in the plane and four  fold coordinated cu in the chain layers cu(1)@xmath7 in ybco7 , respectively .",
    "similarly , the cu(2e ) and cu(1e ) sites have the same local structural environment as cu(2 ) in the plane and two  fold coordinated cu in the chain layers cu(1)@xmath0 in ybco6 .",
    "nmr parameters for these lines will be compared with the known@xcite nmr parameters ( knight shifts , nuclear quadrupole frequency and asymmetry parameters ) of the corresponding sites in ybco7 and ybco6 to determine the line assignments .    in order to obtain the nmr parameters for the observed lines",
    ", we have measured the complete @xmath34cu spectrum including the satellite and central transitions at different frequencies and fields along the three crystallographic axes . a typical complete spectrum is shown in fig .  [ totspeccax ] for * h*@xmath33*c * at 70 k. note that for this direction of the applied field , the central and lower satellite transitions of lines a and c overlap .",
    "the spectra were analyzed using second order perturbation theory for the quadrupolar shift to the zeeman interaction ( see appendix ) for central transitions and by exact diagonalization for * h*@xmath35 parallel to crystallographic axes for the satellites since second order perturbation theory is insufficient for these resonances .    -0.5 cm    if one writes the resonance frequency @xmath36 ( see appendix ) of the central transition to the second order as @xmath37 it is easily seen that @xmath38 is a linear function of @xmath39 with the intercept equal to @xmath40 and the slope proportional to the quadrupolar coupling constant for that direction .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ keff ] , we have shown this data for the central transition of the line d obtained at 70 k and for * h*@xmath33*b*. we have used the position of the center of gravity of this line to obtain @xmath38 since this line is broad at low temperatures .",
    "the knight shifts and efg parameters are obtained for all sites with a simultaneous fit of the central transition and satellite data in the three field orientations@xcite .    -0.5",
    "cm    the nmr parameters for the four observed lines in the normal state are reported in table  [ t : nmrpara ] . for comparison we have listed the nmr parameters of cu(2 ) and cu(1)@xmath7 sites in ybco7 and cu(2 ) and cu(1)@xmath0 sites in ybco6 in table  [ t : summary]@xcite .",
    "we can readily assign the four resonances observed in ortho ",
    "ii to the four different crystallographic sites by comparing their nmr parameters to those of cu sites in ybco7 and ybco6 .",
    "this comparison shows that the two lines a and c , with very similar features , come from the planes ; a from the planar cu sites adjacent to the full chains cu(2f ) and c from the planar cu sites adjacent to the empty chains cu(2e ) .",
    "the efg principal axis for both sites is along the @xmath19axis which is the same for the cu(2 ) sites in ybco7 and ybco6 .",
    "the asymmetry parameter for these sites is very small ( nearly axially symmetric ) as with the cu(2 ) sites in ybco7 and ybco6 .",
    "the slightly larger asymmetry parameter observed in ortho ",
    "ii might be explained by crystal structure arguments since ortho ",
    "ii structure has a lower symmetry than the ortho ",
    "i or tetragonal phases .",
    "the cu(2f ) and cu(2e ) resonances appear at different positions because of their different quadrupolar coupling constants .",
    "since the quadrupolar coupling depends on the ion s surrounding charge distribution as well as the local charge at the position of the ion , a different coupling is expected for the two planar cu sites as observed . we will discuss the contribution of the lattice and valence electrons to this coupling in more detail below .",
    "the @xmath41 for cu(2e ) is higher than the observed one in ybco6 , consistent with the trend of @xmath41 vs. doping@xcite . the same intensity of the cu(2f ) and cu(2e ) lines@xcite within our s / n is an indication that there are equal numbers of these sites in the crystal .",
    "hence there is a high degree of ordering in the chain layers with a periodic sequence of full and empty chains .",
    "the mere fact that we have observed only two distinct cu(2 ) signals for both satellite and central transitions ( fig .",
    "[ totspeccax ] ) is suggestive of a complete ordering of the full and empty chains . in a disordered structure",
    "the signal would merge to one broad resonance with some splitting depending on the degree of ordering .",
    "such partially resolved splittings for the planar cu resonances is typical@xcite in previous generations of ybco6+@xmath4 samples .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the calculated values produce the correct efg principal axes .",
    "furthermore , small values of the asymmetry parameters for cu(2f@xmath42e ) indicate a small deviation of these sites from tetragonal symmetry in accordance with our experimental results",
    ". the directions of the principal axes and the values of @xmath43 are not expected to be affected so much by the electronic structure of the subject ion since this effect is isotropic to first order .",
    "this explains the success of the point charge model in predicting the principal axes and @xmath43 values .",
    "a larger value of @xmath44 is obtained for the cu(1f ) site .",
    "this value is not as large as the observed one since it does not contain the asymmetric ligand contribution .",
    "since the cu(2f@xmath42e ) and cu(1f ) sites have + 2 valence , one would expect@xcite a valence contribution , ( 1-r)v@xmath45 mhz , to the efg from a hole in the 3d@xmath46 state and a zero contribution for cu(1e ) sites in the 3d@xmath47 state .",
    "our values obtained for this contribution to the efg for cu(1e ) site is small and supports this charge configuration for this site .",
    "we find a difference in valence contribution of 2.19 mhz between the cu(2f ) and cu(2e ) sites .",
    "comparing this value to the experimentally observed 3.15 mhz , we conclude that the valence ( local moment ) contribution to the efg difference at these sites is dominant .",
    "this can be understood as resulting from a different charge transfer for these two sites ; the full chains act as the charge reservoir whereas the empty chains do not .",
    "charge transfered from the full chains resides at both the cu(2f ) and cu(2e ) sites but with a larger amount at cu(2f ) , the site closer to the full chain . the inadequacy of the point charge model is apparent for the cu(1f ) site not only in its prediction of the asymmetry parameter but also in the valence contribution@xcite .",
    "in this case asymmetric ligand effects are mostly responsible .",
    "to investigate the effects of the domain walls on the efg values , we have introduced different types of domain walls and then calculated the efg parameters for different sites .",
    "this calculation shows that the domain boundaries affect the cu(1f@xmath42e ) sites the most and the cu(2f@xmath42e ) sites the least .",
    "our results also show that the bulk values of the lattice contribution to @xmath41 are essentially recovered just one lattice constant away from the domain walls .",
    "line assignments for ybco6.5 have been made .",
    "the lack of an observable nmr signal from the chain ends at the domain walls confirms the long chain lengths suggested by x  ray diffraction .",
    "we place a lower limit on the chain length of 50 lattice constants .",
    "consistent with this is the narrow linewidths comparable to those of the best ybco7 crystals .",
    "this is a result of little oxygen disorder in these crystals .",
    "thus these crystals are a much better realization of the stoichiometric ybco6.5 than previously available .",
    "knight shift and spin  lattice relaxation measurements are in progress to investigate the pseudogap .",
    "in addition , as mentioned above , the long chains appear to support friedel  like oscillations nucleated at the chain ends@xcite .",
    "another consequence of oxygen ordering in the chain layer is the effect it has on the cuo@xmath0 planes via charge transfer .",
    "this is manifested in the cu(2e / f ) splitting .",
    "our analysis concludes that most of this splitting is due to differential charge transfer from the chains .",
    "finally , previous reports of static moments in ybco6.5 are inconsistent with our results .",
