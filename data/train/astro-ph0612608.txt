    "in the several years since the sdss ( sloan digital sky survey ) and 2mass ( two micron all sky survey ) projects pioneered large uniform digital datasets accessible to the astronomical community , another generation of surveys has been spurred by improvements in imaging technology , software pipelines , and the ability to carry out sophisticated astronomical science on databases .",
    "in particular , over the next several years , two large consortia will be exploring deeply into the near - infrared with surveys from 4-metre class telescopes . using ukidss ( ukirt infrared deep sky survey , * ? ? ? * ) and vista ( visible and infrared survey telescope for astronomy , * ? ? ? * ) , they aim to extend the limiting flux of the 2mass @xmath9 bands by three magnitudes or more , as well as into new parameter spaces using the novel @xmath10 and @xmath11 optical / near - infrared filters @xcite .    in part motivated by the search for objects such as the coolest brown dwarfs and highest redshift quasars , deeper surveys in the near - infrared provide valuable information for the practical selection and identification of rare objects from parent catalogues of normal stars and other contaminants .",
    "both high - redshift quasars and brown dwarfs are marked by rising flux towards and beyond 1@xmath12 m , but , until recently , were rarely discovered in the near - infrared due to the shallow limiting magnitude of existing surveys . for normal galactic stars detected in sdss , for example ,",
    "2mass data has provided sufficient depth for successful characterization , such as in @xcite , but brown dwarfs and high - redshift quasars are typically much fainter than the 2mass survey limits ",
    "only @xmath317per cent of sdss - discovered quasars are also detected in 2mass , and these are primarily at low redshifts .    with the first large data release by the ukidss , it is now possible to study the near - infrared properties of a large sample of sdss spectroscopically identified quasars over an extended redshift range .",
    "further , with an eye towards future selection techniques , the addition of deeper near - infrared photometry has potential for the identification of new classes of rare quasars .",
    "just as importantly , deeper near - infrared data facilitates the rejection of spurious candidates in such surveys .",
    "therefore , combining data from the ukidss with existing data from sdss and other surveys may offer large gains in observing efficiency .    in this work ,",
    "we match spectroscopically identified quasars from the sdss dr3 with their newly released ukidss dr1 photometry .",
    "we discuss the data matching procedures in the following sections , examine the joint properties of the quasars compared with normal stars , the photometric behaviour of the quasars versus redshift , and their relation to synthetically generated model quasars . as in @xcite ,",
    "all absolute magnitude values in this paper are based on the standard ` concordance ' cosmology of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 .",
    "the quasars used in this work are drawn from the sdss dr3 quasar catalog , assembled by @xcite .",
    "the dr3 quasar catalogue was generated from spectroscopically confirmed quasars discovered and/or reidentified by the sdss over 3732deg@xmath4 , within the main sdss northern area as well as southern equatorial stripe ( sdss stripe 82 ) .",
    "while futher updates to the sdss quasar catalogue are ongoing , the dr3 version represents the final product in the right ascension ( ra ) and declination ( dec ) regions used in this paper .",
    "the sdss automated spectroscopic quasar program , whose selection criteria and strategy have been discussed in @xcite , targets quasars at redshifts up to @xmath17 , and down to magnitudes @xmath18 ( ab ) , using several magnitude and colour cuts applied to the sdss @xmath8 photometry .    following inspection of the individual spectra and compilation with attributes such as radio , near - infrared , and x - ray emission properties , schneider et al .",
    "retained 46,420 objects , ranging in redshifts from @xmath19 to @xmath20 , and absolute magnitudes @xmath21 to @xmath22 ( including some serendipitously discovered quasars down to a spectroscopic survey limit of @xmath23 ) . typically , the photometric accuracy of the sdss is @xmath24mag and systematic astrometric errors are less than @xmath25 .",
    "these photometric and astrometric properties reflect the high quality of sdss data .",
    "further details of the sdss hardware and software can be found in : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "ukidss represents the first wide and deep ground - based survey in the near - infrared regime since 2mass operations concluded in 2001 .",
    "the ukidss is composed of several sub - surveys targeting different parameter spaces of both galactic and extragalactic observations , planned in a typical ` wedding cake ' strategy which balances wide - field versus deep coverage .",
    "the five sub - surveys include deep / narrow target fields such as the uds ( ultra deep survey ) , and wide / shallow fields such as the gps ( galactic plane survey ) . of relevance to this work is the ukidss large area survey ( las ) , which aims to cover an area of 4,000 deg@xmath4 matching the sdss over seven years .    during the @xmath26 nights per year in which the wfcam instrument @xcite is mounted on ukirt and devoted to ukidss , the project observes the sky under tolerable seeing conditions ( @xmath27 ) , and photometric or mildly non - photometric skies .",
    "each pointing of the telescope covers an effective area of @xmath28 deg@xmath4 , but due to the sparse - filled arrangement of the four 2k@xmath292k infrared detectors , four pointings are necessary to fill in a full sky patch of @xmath30deg@xmath4 . because of the large pixel scale of the detectors ( @xmath31/pixel ) and the large field of view , survey progress is quick , covering this filled tile area in the four las @xmath0 filters to a depth of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 , vega ) in approximately 20 minutes , with a total of 40s effective exposure time per band .",
    "survey progress under good conditions can thus produce approximately 25deg@xmath4 of complete las imaging data per night .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite provide comprehensive descriptions of the survey hardware , software strategy and data product characteristics .",
    "following observation , pipeline processing , and catalogue generation , the typical limiting magnitude of the las is @xmath32 $ ] ( vega , @xmath2 ) or [ 20.79 , 20.49 , 20.19 , 20.09 ] ( ab , 5@xmath33 ) , with photometry having been bootstrap - calibrated to the 2mass system .",
    "these limits represent an approximately three magnitude depth gain compared to the 2mass @xmath9 imagery .",
    "astrometric accuracy in the las is typically @xmath34 , and photometric accuracy is @xmath35mag , measured in the @xmath36-band . imaging in the four filters is taken in pairs , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , for any particular field .",
    "the imaging catalogues present essentially an instantaneous single epoch measurement for each filter - pair but significant time intervals can exist between the two filter - pairs .",
    "the ukidss dr1 release overlaps a subset of the sdss northern and southern areas and achieves a limiting magnitude nearer to the sdss for a typical quasar spectral energy distribution ( sed ) than did 2mass . at the same time , the photometric and astrometric performance of the ukidss is similar to the sdss .",
    "the areal extent of the newly released ukidss imaging is much smaller than the available sdss dr3 coverage and we first trimmed the schneider et al .",
    "( 2005 ) quasar catalogue to dimensions similar to the ukidss dr1 imaging areas . among the total ukidss dr1 imaging area released ,",
    "a significant portion is located in the southern equatorial stripe , which is also a special sdss region where many repeated scans have been taken over the lifetime of the survey . in the future , this area may become a target of deeper survey programs at various wavelengths .",
    "the sdss and ukidss have a common southern equatorial stripe area with an ra - range of approximately 22@xmath39 to 4@xmath39 , and a declination - range of @xmath40 , centered on 0@xmath41 .    extracting quasars from the dr3 catalogue without any imposed constraints ,",
    "the quasars were then positionally cross - matched with the ukidss dr1 database , with a tolerance of @xmath42 , matching only the nearest object to the queried position .",
    "a total of 2837 sdss quasars were succesfully matched to the ukidss dr1 database .",
    "a portion of the southern equatorial ra / dec distribution of the resulting sample of sdss - ukidss quasars is shown in figure [ radecfig ] .",
    "other sky - areas contributing to the sdss - ukidss sample have more complicated geometries ( described in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but show similar matched object densities ( within @xmath43per cent due to sdss spectroscopic plate coverage over-/under - densities ) . within the ra - range 1@xmath39 to @xmath44 , of 574 input quasars in the southern equatorial stripe , ( corresponding to a sky density of @xmath45 ) ,",
    "567 ( 98.7per cent ) have a corresponding ukidss source with at least one detection in the @xmath0-bands .",
    "we employ the results of all the matches to the ukidss dr1 catalogue , irrespective of the number of detections among the four passbands .",
    "figure [ ikfig ] illustrates the relationship of typical matched quasars to the parent sample of all matched point sources in the joint sdss - ukidss dataset , showing the spectroscopic and photometric sample limits of the catalogues from which the quasars are drawn .",
    "ongoing projects , for example employing the novel aaomega multifibre spectrograph at aat @xcite , aim to extend the sdss - selected quasar sample to magnitudes below these limits , and improve constraints on the faint and distant quasar luminosity function .",
    "figure [ redshiftmagdistfig ] illustrates the redshift and absolute magnitude dependence of the full sample of sdss - ukidss quasars , which show no strong bias from the parent unmatched sample of sdss quasars .",
    "further , in ukidss areas which are imaged in all four ukidss @xmath0 bands , we examined the frequency of quasar detection versus band and found no strong dependence ",
    "when a quasar is detected , it can generally be detected in all four bands .",
    "specifically , for example in the above representative area , out of 330 quasars found in the smaller 4-band imaged area , 329 are detected in the @xmath11-band , 328 in the @xmath36-band , 321 in the @xmath46-band and 325 in the @xmath47-band , while 319 have detections in all @xmath0 bands .      in the dr3 quasar catalogue , quasars at high redshifts",
    "are generally unresolved by the sdss imaging pipeline @xcite .",
    "the sdss - ukidss sample shows a similar behaviour in the ukidss imaging bands , though with a greater fraction of resolved quasars detected at low redshift  222 of 278 quasars with redshifts @xmath48 are classified as extended in the ukidss mergedclass parameter .",
    "because the mergedclass parameter combines weighted measurements of the measured source profile from each of the available bands , contribution from low redshift quasar host galaxies , particularly in the @xmath47 band , may influence this trend ( see maddox & hewett 2006 ) .",
    "however , by @xmath49 , only @xmath312per cent of quasars are resolved in any ukidss band , falling to 7per cent and 5per cent by @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively . in the present sample ( without regard to redshift ) , the majority of the quasars are classified as point sources with good point spread function ( psf ) fits ( ukidss database @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) , many are classified as extended ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) , and a smaller fraction possess poor psf - fits ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) .",
    "ten objects appear as uncertain extended - source fits ( @xmath58 ) , or are classified as noise .       as cosmologically distant point sources , quasars should provide a fixed reference frame on the sky .",
    "therefore , comparisons of the astrometry between different surveys of these same objects can yield a measure of the relative astrometric errors . using the sample of sdss - ukidss quasars then , the positional offsets between the surveys was determined .",
    "the resulting distribution of relative separations is shown in figure [ posdiff ] , along with a large reference sample of reliably measured normal galactic stars ( @xmath59 ) . while a maximum offset of @xmath60 can be seen for a few quasars ( and up to @xmath61 for the stellar population ) , the bulk of the sample is well modelled by a gaussian distribution with a full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath62 . in comparison ,",
    "the stellar population displays a somewhat wider distribution of astrometric residuals , with a fwhm of @xmath63 .",
    "these parameters are consistent with the sdss/2mass astrometric comparison in @xcite .",
    "we also find a small systematic absolute offset in both ra and dec of @xmath64 between the sdss and ukidss positions .",
    "in addition to providing sdss - measured properties , the dr3 quasar catalogue was matched with external datasets , such as first and rosat detections , galactic extinction measurements and 2mass photometry . using this information , we examined the differences in quasar photometry between the 2mass and ukidss measurements . for the sdss - ukidss quasars , we extracted any available 2mass magnitudes in the @xmath9 bands .",
    "as can be inferred from the resulting sample in figure [ magsdifffig ] , many sdss - ukidss quasars fall well below the nominal 2mass @xmath2 limiting magnitudes ( @xmath65 , vega ) .",
    "however , a small fraction are still measured in the 2mass catalogues , down to approximately @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 . in our sample ,",
    "474 of 2837 sdss / ukidss matched quasars ( 17per cent ) were sufficiently bright to be detected in the 2mass catalogue in any band . comparing ukidss and 2mass magnitudes in this range then , we find a scatter of @xmath69mag between the two quasar measurements ( above the @xmath2 2mass limits ) , and similar to the envelope of scatter in reference point sources at these faint magnitudes , which for example ranges from @xmath70mag at the bright end to @xmath71mag at the @xmath2 2mass detection limits ( figure [ magsdifffig ] , left panel ) .",
    "while quasar variability may account for a small portion of the photometric differences , on the order of @xmath72mag , as @xcite have discussed previously , here the photometric errors should dominate any such variability contribution .",
    "although many quasars are individually not detected in the 2mass imaging , the ukidss photometry now allows us to demonstrate the latent detection ability of 2mass . selecting 60 sdss - ukidss quasars at @xmath73 ( which can not be detected in 2mass )",
    ", we extracted the 2mass @xmath9 atlas images around each sdss - ukidss quasar position .",
    "the 2mass atlas images were then stacked , yielding the composite source shown in figure [ jhkstackfig ] . in areas of sky that will not be covered by ukidss , or other future surveys ,",
    "this technique may allow 2mass to provide useful information on populations of faint sources ( a technique recently demonstrated by * ? ? ? * for example ) .",
    "using the sdss - ukidss quasars , we now examine the optical and near - infrared colour properties of the sample , their relation to stellar properties in the same parameter space , and consider the utility of quasar - star separation.[magnitudescaveat ] an important preliminary note here is that in all calculations , as well as resulting figures and tables in this work , we use the magnitude systems returned automatically and without modification by the sdss and ukidss survey databases . in the case of the sdss , these are asinh magnitudes on the ab system ( specifically psfmags ) , while for the ukidss , these are vega magnitudes calibrated to 2mass ( yjhkapermag3 for point sources ) .",
    "we adopt this approach for the ease of observers querying the joint dataset , so that ab - to - vega magnitude and colour transformations ( which are sometimes accidentally neglected ) are not necessary for immediate interpretation of retrieved data in conjunction with results shown here .",
    "also , slight variations in the choice of conversion factors ( depending on the spectral template used ) will therefore not affect the results discussed .",
    "for subsequent analysis , however , a single more consistent physical ab magnitude scheme may be preferable , using ab - vega transformations such as those tabulated in @xcite .",
    "the filter systems of the sdss and ukidss are shown in figure [ filtersfig ] .",
    "in particular , while the sdss @xmath8 and mko - based @xmath9 filters are well - known and commonly used , the addition of the novel @xmath10 and @xmath11 filters of the ukidss are a relatively recent development and noteworthy . proposed by @xcite , and discussed extensively in @xcite , the ukidss @xmath10 and @xmath11 filters improved upon the existing broadband coverage between the optical and near - infrared in several respects .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands are defined by interference filters with sharp wavelength cutoffs and , coupled with the high sensitivity of modern infrared detectors , remedy some of the deficiencies in current imaging around @xmath74 m .",
    "first , the ukidss @xmath10 filter is much more sharply defined than the sdss @xmath75 , because the sdss @xmath75 filter itself in fact has a relatively flat transmission of @xmath76 which continues out beyond @xmath77 m ( illustrated by * ? ? ?",
    "the overall @xmath75-band redward cutoff ( i.e. total system throughput ) then relies on the declining ccd silicon sensitivity to terminate the band , and thus results in a very extended filter profile .",
    "the ccd - detector sensitivity envelope , beginning with a minimum in the ultraviolet , rising to a maximum around the @xmath78-band , and terminating with a minimum at @xmath79 m , largely accounts for the highly peaked shape of the sdss throughput .",
    "this is in contrast to the relatively flat response of the ukidss system , owing to the roughly constant sensitivity of the hawaii-2 hgcdte detectors throughout the near - infrared .",
    "continuing redward , the @xmath11-band ( used by the ukidss las ) provides a new region of sensitivity in the @xmath80    wavelength gap between the @xmath75(or @xmath10)-band and the mko @xmath36 band . among other motivations ,",
    "the @xmath11 filter was specifically designed with the selection of very cool brown dwarfs and high - redshift quasars in mind .",
    "the increasingly red flux of these objects versus temperature ( for brown dwarfs ) or redshift ( for quasars ) has proven highly useful in rare object searches in the last few years @xcite , but has reached a barrier as current surveys , such as the sdss , no longer provide sufficient sensitivity in the @xmath79 m range .",
    "the high throughput of the ukidss system at these wavelengths , combined with sharper band profiles , allow the more precise discrimination of potential quasar candidate redshifts and brown dwarf types , while avoiding unnecessary sky background contamination .",
    "the resulting @xmath81 sensitivity of the ukidss imaging is shown in the bottom panel of figure [ filtersfig ] , and compared with the sdss as well as 2mass sensitivities in the @xmath9 bands .",
    "a composite quasar spectrum at @xmath82 is also shown , illustrating the important capability of ukidss to detect the typical quasar near - infrared continuum , versus non - detection in 2mass .      in figure",
    "[ coloursvszfig ] , we plot the 2837 sdss - ukidss quasars , in various colours versus sdss spectroscopic redshift . in each colour , only those quasars with detected flux in both of the two contributing bands are plotted , i.e. objects with non - detections in the necessary filters ( indicated as such as by @xmath83 in the sdss or ukidss catalogues ) are omitted .    as has been discussed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ,",
    "the behaviour of quasar colours is suprisingly well - modeled across extended redshift and luminosity ranges by a single composite sed .",
    "the passage of the strong emission lines in and out of the various filters controls the small - scale fluctuation of the quasar colours versus redshift , while the extended underlying continuum provides the distinguishing characteristic separating quasar colours from those of stars .",
    "importantly , for certain applications , such as the @xmath84 @xmath85-dropout selection used by @xcite , absorption by the intervening intergalactic medium provides a strong spectral discontinuity allowing the identification of quasars .",
    "this effect can be seen for example in the rapidly rising @xmath86 colour at redshifts @xmath87 , as more quasar flux in the @xmath78 band is absorbed by the intergalactic medium with increasing redshift .",
    "the observed quasar sample beyond @xmath88 is affected by the declining space density of the quasar population and the small volumes probed . as a result ,",
    "the flux - limited sample becomes quite sparse ( figure [ coloursvszfig ] ) . in order to extend the useful predicted colour - redshift values further than @xmath88 , we generated synthetic photometry and colours of a composite quasar spectrum to predict the median redshift - colour evolution track .",
    "the technique has been described previously (  quasar cloning   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we follow a similar approach here .",
    "the modified composite quasar based on the spectrum of maddox & hewett was employed as the model sed , updated to include a base continuum contribution , which dominates at @xmath89 , consisting of a dual power - law form @xmath90 where @xmath91 specifies the quasar continuum slope , @xmath92 .",
    "a blackbody component , with t@xmath93k , dominates at @xmath94 , resulting in an overall spectral shape similar to the composite spectrum of glikman et al .",
    "for each redshift bin in steps of @xmath95 , the model sed was redshifted and the average effect of intervening lyman-@xmath91 absorption added .",
    "the resulting quasar spectra were used to generate magnitudes and colours , again with sdss magnitudes on the ab system , and ukidss magnitudes on the vega system , as would naturally be found in the respective survey databases .",
    "these are overlaid in figure [ coloursvszfig ] .",
    "similar colour - redshift loci , based directly on the various composite quasar spectra available ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are frequently employed for a variety of purposes .",
    "it should be stressed that the significant contribution of host galaxy light in the low - luminosity quasars that typically dominate the composite spectra at wavelengths @xmath96  leads to predictions that are far too red in the optical - near - infrared colours , compared to the observations , at redshifts @xmath97 .",
    "in addition , given the large magnitude range covered by the sdss - ukidss quasars , we investigated whether the observed distribution of quasar colours showed dependence on luminosity .",
    "this was accomplished by selecting two subsets of quasars , those bright enough to be detected in 2mass , and the remaining ones detected only in ukidss .",
    "the colour differences between the two samples were calculated in redshift bins of size @xmath98 and are shown in figure [ coloursdiffs ] .",
    "no significant difference is seen between the two samples .      to compare the quasar colours with those of normal stars",
    ", we extracted a stellar sample from the ukidss / sdss database .",
    "this was accomplished by querying the ukidss reliablelaspointsource table , which returned relatively bright objects displaying good photometric errors ( @xmath99 mag ) , unresolved shape / flux profiles , and in uncrowded areas .",
    "then , for a few selected two - colour spaces of interest , the stellar and quasar samples are plotted in figure [ colourcolourfig ] .",
    "photometric searches for quasars generally compete against heavy contamination by stellar objects with similar colours , due to the intrinsic rarity of quasars .",
    "the relative distributions of quasars versus stars in a chosen colour combination will generally control the search efficiency , i.e. how many contaminants must be observed to return one object from the desired sample .",
    "the progression of the two - colour plots in figure [ colourcolourfig ] illustrates the varying success of distinguishing quasars from normal stars using different colours . for colours involving the ultraviolet , such as in @xmath100 , @xmath101 ,",
    "the strong short - wavelength quasar continuum flux is well known to provide a separation from stars via the ultraviolet - excess ( uvx ) technique .",
    "relatively clear separation of the two populations is observed here and provides a highly successful selection method for low redshift quasars .    in the optical bands ,",
    "adjacent filter combinations provide little discrimination between the quasar and stellar populations",
    ". however , with the addition of near - infrared data , and particularly @xmath47-band imaging , the extended quasar continua again results in an effective differentiation between quasars and stars .",
    "this attribute , exploited by the ` kx ' method @xcite , can provide a useful selection at high redshift , @xmath102 , where the uvx technique is unsuccessful due to the effect of absorption by the igm in the bluest passbands .",
    "looking farther into the infrared , an additional area of significant interest in the future may be the combination of deep near - infrared surveys such as ukidss with mid - infrared legacy imaging from the _ spitzer space telescope_. as has been demonstrated by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , quasar - star separation is highly successful in the mid - infrared bands , and also benefits from high sensitivity due to the supressed background ( @xmath103jy in @xmath104s at @xmath105 m ) . in areas with good optical , near - infrared , and proposed mid - infrared imaging coverage from _",
    ", such as the southern equatorial stripe , the combination of the resulting catalogues has the potential to reach new distant and faint quasar populations while providing nearly continuous bandpass coverage as emission lines and continuum flux shift with redshift .",
    "the utility of quasars in probing the distant universe has been demonstrated to great effect in the past few years , with these high redshift objects illuminating not only their own properties , but also the physical state of the igm and the distant universe .",
    "however , the discovery of quasars in certain redshift intervals is , in practice , a laborious enterprise . in the absence of information from the wavelength extremes , identifying quasars by special properties such as radio or x - ray flux , discovery of quasars at redshifts near @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath84 remains a significant challenge .",
    "observers fight the combination of the intrinsically declining numbers of the target population and the increasing numbers of contaminating galactic stars . in previous work",
    "we have outlined some of the selection techniques and numbers of quasars to be expected in the sdss and ukidss , and have found that the ukidss - sdss joint dataset is capable of selecting quasars at @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "however , at the magnitude limits of the ukidss ( @xmath109 ) , the @xmath110 expected quasars at @xmath108 on the whole sky clearly places this parameter space in the category of rare , high - value , but resource - intensive targets .    here",
    ", we discuss the more tractable question of improving the effectiveness of quasar selection at redshifts @xmath88 and @xmath107 where colour - selected samples in the optical encounter particular difficulties @xcite .",
    "the relatively deep ukidss , and future vista , limiting magnitudes in the near - infrared , and the high rate of success in matching the present sample of sdss quasars to ukidss , suggests that quasars at @xmath88 and @xmath107 may be recovered by employing @xmath47-band information .",
    "figure [ jhkfig ] shows , for example , a more detailed view of the quasar - star separation in colour space when @xmath47-band information is added .",
    "while the population overlap ( and thus contamination ) is significant for predicted quasar colours around @xmath111 , the colour separation becomes large from @xmath112 to @xmath113 . because the quasars shown are gathered from optical selection techniques",
    ", this implies that independent ( or joint ) use of the near - infrared photometry on unidentified stellar sources in such a region should yield additional quasars .",
    "thus , an appropriate choice of optical and near - infrared colours can select quasars in the redshift ranges of interest .",
    "figure [ uzykfig ] illustrates one example of a successful quasar identification / separation scheme in the @xmath114,@xmath115 colour space which more cleanly separates normal galactic stars from quasars by sampling the underlying characteristic spectral break / inflexion features , as described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this colour selection boundary illustrated is given by the following criteria : @xmath116    which results in a completeness of 97per cent ( measured by the fraction of quasars selected by the above cut ) _ for those quasars with magnitudes in these bands_. the overall success of the selection will vary as a function of the magnitudes of the target population compared to the limiting magnitudes in each passband . for instance , the selection of @xmath117 quasars would be most sensitive ( and efficient ) using colour cuts in the sdss @xmath118 band and beyond , such as ( @xmath119 ) , ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "as illustrated above , the availability of photometry covering the rest - frame optical and near - infrared wavelength regions offers the prospect of obtaining a more complete census of the quasar population , both in terms of the redshift range accessible and the variety of quasar seds included .",
    "a consequence of the extended restframe wavelength range accessed through obervations spanning the @xmath121 through @xmath47 bands for quasars with redshifts @xmath122 , is the importance of incorporating realistic model quasar seds in order to interpret the properties of the quasar population reliably .",
    "the simple power - law approximation to quasar seds , modulated only by the presence of the strongest emission lines , that is relatively effective when interpreting observations probing only the restframe wavelength region @xmath123of high - luminosity quasars over redshifts @xmath124 is entirely indequate when analysing quasar samples of the type presented here . to illustrate the point graphically , figure [ glikman ] shows a composite quasar spectrum constructed from the ultraviolet composite of @xcite and the optical and near - infrared portion of the composite of @xcite , joined at 3100 .",
    "the very large colour changes in the optical - near - infrared colours as a function of redshift evident in figure [ coloursvszfig ] are a direct manifestation of the form of the ( very non - power - law - like ) quasar sed .",
    "further care is required when considering the effect of host galaxy contamination on the observed properties of the ` quasars ' , particularly at redshifts @xmath125 and at lower luminosities @xcite .",
    "the availability of the deep near - infrared photometry would also allow a quasar sample to be selected over a broader redshift range using observed passbands that closely approximate a fixed restframe wavelength range for the quasars at each redshift , thereby minimising the k - correction factors .",
    "however , the more ambitious goal is now to utilise the availability of the full set of @xmath126 bands to define samples that will provide powerful new constraints on the properties of the quasar population as a function of redshift , luminosity and sed - type .",
    "we have matched 98per cent of sdss dr3 quasars over @xmath127deg@xmath4 with their near - infrared counterparts in the ukidss dr1 source catalogue .",
    "the resulting sample of 2837 quasars is representative of the full range of magnitudes and redshifts in the sdss spectroscopic sample .",
    "the astrometric properties of the sample are similar to previous experience with 2mass - sdss matched sources , while the ukidss photometry extends the matched imaging depth by three magnitudes in the @xmath9 bands compared to 2mass .",
    "the median colours of the matched quasars agree well with predictions generated using a model quasar sed and provide a guide for higher redshift selection techniques .",
    "optical and near - infrared colours , in appropriate combinations , provide effective separation of stars and known quasars over essentially the full redshift range @xmath128 , overcoming the limitations of employing only optical colours in the redshift ranges @xmath88 and @xmath107 .",
    "the authors are grateful for the efforts of all the ukidss consortium members who observed , processed , and produced the datasets analyzed here .",

    "<S> the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) is the first of a new generation of hemispheric imaging projects to extend the work of the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) by reaching three magnitudes deeper in @xmath0 imaging , to @xmath1 ( @xmath2 , vega ) over wide fields . </S>",
    "<S> better complementing existing optical surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , the resulting public imaging catalogues provide new photometry of rare object samples too faint to be reached previously . </S>",
    "<S> the first data release of ukidss has already surpassed 2mass in terms of photons gathered , and using this new dataset we examine the near - infrared properties of 2837 quasars found in the sdss and newly catalogued by the ukidss in @xmath3189deg@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the matched quasars include the ra range 22@xmath5 to 4@xmath5 on the southern equatorial stripe ( sdss stripe 82 ) , an area of significant future followup possibilities with deeper surveys and pointed observations . </S>",
    "<S> the sample covers the redshift and absolute magnitude ranges @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and 98per cent of sdss quasars have matching ukidss data . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the photometry , astrometry , and various colour properties of the quasars . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the effectiveness of quasar / star separation using the near - infrared passbands . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of sdss @xmath8 photometry with the @xmath0 near - infrared photometry from ukidss over large areas of sky has enormous potential for advancing our understanding of the quasar population .    </S>",
