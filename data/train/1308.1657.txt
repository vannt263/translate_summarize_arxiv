    ", gravity may compress the matter in the core regions of such stars up to more than ten times the density of ordinary atomic nuclei , thus providing a high - pressure environment in which numerous subatomic particle processes are likely to compete with each other .",
    "theoretical studies indicate that hyperons , boson condensates ( pions , kaons , h - matter ) and/or deconfined up , down and strange quarks may exist in the core regions of nss ( for an overview , see @xcite and references therein ) .    based on qualitative considerations concerning the stiffness of the nuclear equation of state ( eos )",
    ", one could argue that the detection of high - mass nss , such as psr j16142230 with a gravitational mass of @xmath3 @xcite and psr j0348 + 0432 with a mass of @xmath1 @xcite , may rule out the existence of deconfined quarks in their central core regions , since quark deconfinement would take away so much pressure that high - mass nss are not supported . as shown in ref .",

    "depending on the strength of the quark vector repulsion , we find that mixed phases of confined hadronic matter and deconfined quarks can exist in neutron stars as massive as @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "the radii of these objects are between 12 and 13  km , as expected for neutron stars .",
    "according to our study , for the n3njl model , a transition to pure quark matter occurs only in neutron stars which lie on the    gravitationally unstable branch of the stellar sequences if the parametrization nl3 for the hadronic matter lagrangian is used .",
    "this is different for the other hadronic parametrization considered in this paper , gm1 , which predicts , for sufficiently large vector interactions among the quarks , pure quark matter cores in maximum - mass neutron stars .",
    "pure quark matter cores are also obtained for the l3njl model if the nl3 parametrization is being use . for the gm1 parametrization , however , pure quark matter is not present but gives way to an extended region of deconfined quarks which are in chemical equilibrium with various baryon species .",
    "the latter is found to exist in all neutron stars models , independent of the value of the vector repulsion among quarks . with increasing stellar mass ,",
    "all the stellar core compositions consist either of nucleons only , nucleons and hyperons , a mixed phase of quarks and hadrons ( mp ) , and , in some cases , a pure quark matter phase ( qp ) in the core .",
