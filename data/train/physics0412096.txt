    "characterization of optically transparent media with polarized - light scattering methods , is important for communication technology , industrial and medical applications @xcite .",
    "when polarized light is incident on an optically random medium it suffers multiple scattering and , as a result , it may emerge partly or completely depolarized . the amount of depolarization can be quantified by calculating either the entropy ( @xmath0 ) or the degree of polarization ( @xmath1 ) of the scattered field @xcite .",
    "it is simple to show that the field quantities @xmath0 and @xmath1 are related by a single - valued function : @xmath2 .",
    "for example polarized light ( @xmath3 ) has @xmath4 while partially polarized light ( @xmath5 ) has @xmath6 . when the incident beam is polarized and the output beam is partially polarized , the medium is said to be depolarizing .",
    "an average measure of the depolarizing power of the medium is given by the so called index of depolarization ( @xmath7 ) @xcite .",
    "non - depolarizing media are characterized by @xmath8 , while depolarizing media have @xmath9 .",
    "a depolarizing scattering process is always accompanied by an increase of the entropy of the light , the increase being due to the interaction of the field with the medium .",
    "an average measure of the entropy that a given random medium can add to the entropy of the incident light beam , is given by the polarization entropy @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "non - depolarizing media are characterized by @xmath11 , while for depolarizing media @xmath12 .",
    "as the field quantities @xmath0 and @xmath1 are related to each other , so are the medium quantities @xmath10 and @xmath7 . in a previous paper @xcite we showed the existence of a universal relation @xmath13 between the polarization entropy @xmath10 and the index of depolarization @xmath7 valid for any scattering medium .",
    "more specifically , @xmath10 is related to @xmath7 by a multi - valued function , which covers the complete regime from zero to total depolarization .",
    "this universal relation provides a simple characterization of the polarization properties of _ any _ medium , as well as a consistency check for the experimentally measured mueller matrices .",
    "we emphasize that the results found in @xcite apply both to classical and quantum scattering processes , and might therefore become relevant for quantum communication optical applications , where depolarization is due to the loss of quantum coherence @xcite .",
    "+ in this contribution , we present an experimental study of the depolarizing properties of a large set of scattering media , ranging from milk to multi - mode optical fibers .",
    "the results confirm the theoretical predictions for the bounds of the multi - valued function @xmath14 .",
    "the manuscript is divided as follows : in section ii we review the mueller - stokes formalism and show the differences between deterministic ( non - depolarizing ) and non - deterministic ( depolarizing ) scattering media .",
    "we also discuss the statistical nature of a depolarizing process resulting from the average ( either spatial or temporal ) performed in a multi - mode detection scheme .",
    "furthermore , in order to describe the transverse spatial average present in our multi - mode detection set - up , we formally introduce the concept of an effective mueller matrix ( @xmath15 ) . in section iii",
    "we describe the experimental scheme for polarization tomography that was used to characterize the different scattering samples .",
    "these can be divided into two categories : ( a ) non - stationary ( samples which fluctuate during the measurement time ) and ( b ) stationary ( samples which do not fluctuate ) .",
    "we then show the experimental results obtained for these samples followed by a brief discussion of the interesting structures in the @xmath16 plane , that were revealed by the experiments . finally , in section iv we draw our conclusions .",
    "in the introduction we stressed the fact that passive optical systems may be grouped in two broad classes : depolarizing and non - depolarizing systems . to the first class",
    "belong all media which decrease the degree of polarization @xmath1 of the impinging light , while to the second one belong all media which do not decrease @xmath1 . in this section",
    "we want to make the discussion more quantitative by using the mueller - stokes formalism which is widely used for the description of the polarization state of light beams .",
    "consider a quasi - monochromatic beam of light of mean angular frequency @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "let us denote with @xmath18 the axes of a cartesian coordinate system , with the @xmath19-axis along the direction of propagation of the beam whose angular spread around @xmath19 is assumed to be small enough to satisfy the _",
    "paraxial _ approximation .",
    "let @xmath20 be the component of the complex paraxial electric field vector in the @xmath21- and @xmath22-direction respectively , at the point @xmath23 located in the transverse plane @xmath24 at time @xmath25 .",
    "if the field is _ uniform _ on the transverse plane , then @xmath26 and @xmath27 will be , in fact , independent of @xmath21 and @xmath22 and a complete description of the field can be achieved in terms of a doublets @xmath28 of complex variables ( with possibly stochastic fluctuations ) : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are now complex - valued functions of @xmath32 and @xmath25 only .",
    "a complete study of the propagation of @xmath28 along @xmath19 can be found , e.g. , in @xcite , however , for our purposes the main result we need is that propagation through non - depolarizing media can be described by a _",
    "mueller ( or mueller - jones ) matrix @xmath33 , while to describe the propagation of a light beam through a depolarizing medium it is necessary to use a _ non - deterministic _ mueller matrix @xmath34 .      in a wide - sense ,",
    "a _ deterministic _ linear scatterer as , e.g. , a quarter - wave plate , a rotator or a polarizer , is an optical system which can be described by a @xmath35 complex jones @xcite matrix @xmath36 with this we mean that if @xmath28 and @xmath37 describe the polarization state of the field immediately before and immediately after the scatterer respectively , then they are linearly related by the matrix @xmath38 : @xmath39 an alternative description can be given in terms of the stokes parameters of the beam . to this end",
    "let @xmath40 be the covariance matrix of the field defined as @xcite @xmath41 where the brackets denote the statistical average over different realizations of the random fluctuations of the field .",
    "then the four stokes parameters @xmath42 @xmath43 of the beam are defined as @xmath44 were the symbol @xmath45 denote the trace operation and the @xmath46 are the normalized pauli matrices : @xmath47 now , if with @xmath42 and @xmath48 we denotes the stokes parameters of the beam before and after the scatterer respectively , it is easy to show that that they are linearly related by the real - valued @xmath49 mueller - jones matrix @xmath33 as @xmath50 where summation on repeated indices is understood and @xmath51 where the symbol `` @xmath52 '' denotes the outer matrix product and the _ unitary _ matrix @xmath53 is defined as @xmath54 from the structure of @xmath33 follows that a deterministic medium does not depolarize , that is @xmath55 where the degree of polarization @xmath1 of the field is defined as @xmath56 let us conclude by noticing that for deterministic media the two descriptions in terms of @xmath38 or @xmath33 are completely equivalent in the sense that the @xmath57 real elements of @xmath33 do not contain more information than the @xmath58 complex elements of @xmath38 .      a _",

    "then , the mueller matrix @xmath34 of the system can be written as @xmath62 where the @xmath63 symbol denotes the average with respect to the ensemble representing the medium : @xmath64 at this point it is useful to introduce the auxiliary @xmath65 hermitian matrix @xmath66 defined as @xmath67 which is , by definition , positive semidefinite , that is all its eigenvalues @xmath68 are non - negative . then , it is possible to show that the depolarization index @xmath7 and the polarization entropy @xmath10 can be written as @xmath69^{1/2},\\ ] ] @xmath70 from ref . @xcite",
    "we know that @xmath10 is a multi - valued function of @xmath7 and that this dependence determines some physical bounds to _ any _ polarization scattering process .",
    "the function @xmath13 shows thus character of universality . in the next section",
    "we shall confirm this theoretical prediction with experimental results .      in classical optics",
    ", a light beam appears to be depolarized when its polarization direction varies rapidly with respect to other degrees of freedom that are not measured during the experiment ( e.g. wavelength , time or position of the beam ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , depolarization occurs also when a single - mode polarization input beam is coupled with a multi - mode ( either spectral or spatial ) system as , e.g. , an optical fiber .",
    "in fact it is possible to identify two basic depolarizing processes , ( a ) one intrinsic to the medium , and ( b ) one due to the measurement scheme . in the first case ( a ) non - stationary temporal fluctuations of the optical properties of the medium , for instance due to the brownian motion of suspended particles in a liquid @xcite , cause depolarization",
    "even when a single - mode detection scheme is employed ( the time average performed during the measurement is responsible for the depolarization ) . on the other hand , type ( b ) stationary depolarizers ( i.e. glass fibers )",
    "do not fluctuate in time and produce light depolarization only in the presence of a multi - mode detection scheme . in this case",
    "it is simple to build explicitly the ensemble of mueller - jones matrices representative of the medium , that we introduced in the previous subsection .",
    "+ to this end , let us consider the case of a scattering process in which a coupling between polarization and spatial modes of the field occurs and a multi - mode detection scheme is employed .",
    "this is , in fact , the case occurring for the optical fibers we used .",
    "the mueller - stokes formalism , is suitable for a single - mode description of the field ; however , it is possible to extend this formalism to the case in which @xmath71 spatial modes of the field impinge on the scatterer , @xmath72 leave from it and @xmath73 modes are eventually detected .",
    "we make the assumption that different spatial modes of the field are uncorrelated , that is we do not consider interference phenomena which are ruled out by the required linearity with respect to the intensities of the field @xcite .",
    "moreover , without loss of generality , we assume @xmath74 . let @xmath75 be a generic @xmath58-d stokes vector defined with respect to the mode @xmath76 , where @xmath77 .",
    "for a @xmath78-mode field we have a collection of @xmath78 of these @xmath58-d stokes vectors that we can arrange in a single @xmath79-d `` super '' vector @xmath80 .",
    "when the @xmath78-mode light beam undergoes a polarization - sensitive scattering , then , in general , the stokes vectors @xmath81 of the input beam are related to the set of vectors @xmath82 of the output beam by : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the @xmath49 mueller - jones matrix that describes the scattering from the input mode @xmath85 to the output mode @xmath86 .",
    "if we introduce a `` super '' @xmath87 mueller matrix defined as @xmath88 where each block @xmath89 is a @xmath49 mueller - jones matrix , then we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) in a compact form as @xmath90 after the scattering process took place , we have to detect its products .",
    "we recently showed @xcite that when @xmath91 modes of the field are detected , a mode - insensitive polarization analyzer , put in front of a bucket - detector , can be described by a @xmath87 block - diagonal matrix @xmath92 : @xmath93 where @xmath94 are @xmath49 real - valued positive semi - definite matrices ( in fact , projectors ) , and @xmath95 is a null @xmath96 matrix . in the paraxial limit ( @xmath97 ) each @xmath98 reduces to the @xmath99 identity .",
    "then , the polarization state of the scattered beam after the analyzer , is described by the super stokes vector @xmath100 given by @xmath101 finally , because of the mode - insensitive detection , the sum over all the detected modes reduces the number of degrees of freedom of the field from @xmath79 to @xmath58 , producing the _ detected _ 4-d stokes vector @xmath102 @xmath103 where we have assumed that the input light beam is prepared in the single mode @xmath104 , so that @xmath105 and with @xmath106 we have denoted an effective @xmath49 mueller matrix defined as @xmath107 which is written as a sum of @xmath73 mueller - jones matrices .",
    "it is important to notice that while the product of mueller - jones matrices is still a mueller - jones matrix ( in physical terms : a cascade of non - depolarizing optical elements is still a non - depolarizing optical system ) , a sum , in general , is not .",
    "this causes depolarization .",
    "moreover , since the `` matrix coefficients '' @xmath98 are non - negative , the matrix @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) is an explicit version of the mueller matrix written in eq .",
    "( [ new11 ] ) .",
    "then we have shown , by an explicit derivation , how to build the statistical ensemble representing the depolarizing medium , for this particular case .",
    "schematic of the polarization tomography set - up . for details",
    "see text.,width=15 ]    in order to measure the effective mueller matrix @xmath15 and thus the index of depolarization @xmath7 and the entropy @xmath10 of a scattering medium , it is straightforward to follow a tomography procedure : the light to be scattered by the sample is successively prepared in the four polarization basis states of linear ( @xmath108 ) and circular ( @xmath109 ) polarization , which are represented by four independent input stokes vectors @xmath110 . for each of these input fields the corresponding stokes vector @xmath111 , that represents the output field ,",
    "is obtained by measuring the intensities of the scattered light in the same four polarization basis states .",
    "this procedure provides the @xmath99 independent parameters required to determine the 16 elements @xmath112 of the mueller matrix from eq.([new8 ] ) .",
    "note that we actually employ two additional polarization basis states ( @xmath113 , @xmath114 ) in our experiments and perform @xmath115 measurement , which allows us to reduce experimental errors by averaging within the over - complete data set .",
    "the experimental scheme is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the light source is a power - stabilized he - ne laser at 633  nm wavelength .",
    "the input field is prepared by the polarizer unit ( pu ) , consisting of a fixed polarizer ( p1 ) , a half - wave plate ( h1 ) , and a quarter - wave plate ( q1 ) . a microscope objective ( mo , @xmath116 ) couples the light into the sample .",
    "the scattered light is collimated by a standard photographic objective ( po , @xmath117  mm@xmath118 ) , followed by an adjustable pinhole ( ph ) that defines the amount of transverse spatial average to be performed in the light detection . the analyzer unit ( au )",
    "consists of a quarter - wave plate ( q2 ) and a polarizer ( p2 ) . together with a focusing lens ( l ) and a photodiode ( pd ) , it probes the polarization state of the scattered output field .",
    "as an estimation of the systematic error of the set - up , mainly due to imperfections of the used retarders , we measured the mueller matrix of air ( i.e.  the identity matrix ) and of well - known deterministic optical elements such as wave - plates .",
    "in all these cases , we found the deviations from the theoretically predicted matrix elements limited to @xmath119 .",
    "the various scattering media we investigated can be divided into ( a ) _ non - stationary _ samples where , e.g. , brownian motion induces temporal fluctuations within the detection integration time , and ( b ) _ stationary _ samples without such fluctuations , most notably multi - mode polymer and glass optical fibers .",

    "the depolarization is caused by multiple reflections within the cylindrical light - guide together with mode mixing .",
    "we selected fibers of various lengths that displayed the full range between non - depolarizing and completely depolarizing properties .",
    "fibers shorter than about 2  cm showed negligible depolarization ( @xmath155 ) . in the case of the glass fibers complete depolarization ( @xmath156 ) was observed for lengths of @xmath157 m , whereas in the case of the polymer fibers this was achieved already for lengths of only @xmath158 cm .",
    "the reason is , presumably , the significant rayleigh scattering at density fluctuations in the polymer material @xcite . + in our experimental scheme , the aperture of the pinhole ( ph ) defines the region of spatial of average in the scattered light detection ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) . by choosing the pinhole diameter between 2  mm and 13  mm , we realized scattering systems which are described by different effective mueller matrices @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , a small pinhole , corresponding to an average over a small set of modes @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) , leads to a large index of depolarization .",
    "however , due to the huge optical mode volume in our fibers , the pinhole adjustment allowed only for small changes , within @xmath159 . with a lower limit of 2  mm in the pinhole",
    "diameter , special care was taken to select a sufficiently large number of speckles in the scattered output field .",
    "( the step - index glass fiber with @xmath133 m core showed the largest speckles of about @xmath128 m fwhm . )",
    "this is necessary in order to average out interference effects , generated by the coherent source ( he - ne laser ) , so that the assumption of uncorrelated modes in the derivation of @xmath15 holds @xcite .      in fig .",
