    "small world networks ( swn ) are those intermediate between a regular lattice and a random graph ( see @xcite and references therein for review ) .",
    "they are believed to catch the essence of networks in reality , such as neural networks@xcite , power grids , social networks , and documents on world wide web@xcite , where remote vertices , while locally clustered , often have the chance to be connected via shortcuts .",
    "since 1998 , when watts and strogatz presented a simple model showing swn effects@xcite , it has been studied intensively and extensively@xcite . from the point of view of statistical physics , the presence of shortcuts assists the system to behave as a whole , showing global coherence and new , swn behavior , possibly apart from their ordinary properties people are familiar with",
    ".    one may be curious about , to what extent the features of phase transitions will be different in spin - lattice models built on small - world networks . because the swn effect widely exists in reality , this question is also of much significance .",
    "although new and interesting features have been revealed recently@xcite , it is still far from being completely answered .",
    "the dynamic aspect has been even less well understood@xcite .",
    "naturally we may expect the evolution of a single spin to be influenced partly by the overall system , however we find it difficult to offer more specific information .",
    "this is due to the complexity of the dynamics itself , and the often formidable mathematical task .    in this article",
    ", we report our work in this interesting problem the critical dynamics of spin - lattice models built on swn . as the introductory content we shall first discuss the general approach . then , among the various model systems , we choose two special ones for a detailed investigation : the gaussian model , which is relatively easy in mathematics , and the one - dimensional ising model .",

    "7 ] is the summarization with some discussions .",
    "following the first prototype@xcite of swn , there have been a number of variants ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) in two basic groups , which can be constructed as the following : the initial network is , for example , a one dimensional loop of @xmath5 vertices , each vertex being connected to its @xmath6 nearest neighbors .",
    "( 1 ) each pair of random vertices are additionally connected with probability @xmath7 ; ( 2 ) the vertices are then visited one after the other , and each link connecting a vertex to one of its @xmath8 nearest neighbors in the clock wise sense is left in place with probability @xmath9 , and with probability @xmath10 is reconnected to a randomly chosen other vertex .",
    "we may call the first group adding - type small - world networks ( a - swn ) and the second group rewiring - type ( r - swn ) . both of these modifications introduce long range connections . the above algorithms can be extended to systems with higher dimensionality and even fractal structures .",
    "( for example , for a spin located somewhere in a cubic lattice , @xmath11 of the @xmath12 bonds in some fixed directions will be reconnected with probability @xmath10 respectively . ) these constructions , with any ( infinitesimally low ) fraction of shortcuts , allow to reconcile local properties of a regular network ( clustering effect ) with global properties of a random one ( the average distance @xmath13 ) .",
    "a spin - lattice model built on swn , which is the focus of this article , can be thus defined : in a @xmath14-dimensional regular network consisting of @xmath5 spins with periodic boundary condition , each spin is linked to its @xmath15 nearest neighbors ( in this article we will choose @xmath16 ) .",
    "then , ( 1 ) a certain number of supplemental links are added ; ( 2 ) a portion of the bonds are rewired .",
    "whether it is in group ( 1 ) ( a - swn ) or group ( 2 ) ( r - swn ) , two spins connected by a shortcut act in the same way as those connected by a regular bond , that is , their interaction contributes to the system hamiltonian and they obey the redistribution ( exchange ) mechanism . in short , there is no difference between a long range bond and a regular one . other definitions may exist .",
    "for example , because these small - world networks are model systems for the networks in reality , one may have reason to choose certain physical quantities , such as @xmath17 in the ising model , to be different .",
    "however , although it is not necessary , we will limit the scope of this article to the above rule .",
    "the various dynamic processes in the critical phenomena are believed to be governed by two basic mechanisms , glauber - type with order parameter nonconserved and kawasaki - type with order parameter conserved .",
    "recently , a glauber - type single - spin transition mechanism@xcite and a kawasaki - type spin - pair redistribution mechanism@xcite have been presented as the natural generalizations of glauber s flipping mechanism@xcite and kawasaki s exchange mechanism@xcite , respectively .",

    "so the theoretically correct way of treating dynamic systems built on swn actually consists of three steps : first we have to make a full list of all the possible realizations and point out the probability of each one of them .",

    "_ this character , as well as some already - proved facts in earlier studies about the static behavior , provides us with some helpful hints for the simplification of the method , which is the topic of the following section .",
    "presently , for the critical dynamics on swn , we still lack a well - established approach , which should be both theoretically reliable and practically feasible . the mentioned - above method ( and the results )",
    "is theoretically rigorous , but it is too complex for the other models , even the simplest one - dimensional ising model . in the above section , we have pointed out that , in _ the dynamic evolution _ of the gaussian model built on swn , the influence of the system as a whole on individual spins is mean - field like . on the other hand , recent studies on the ising model and the @xmath89 model built on swn have also shown that the phase transition is of _ the mean - field - type _ ( see @xcite and sec . [",

    "the various model systems built on swn probably belong to the same mean - field universality class , and they might be treated with the same dynamic approach . in this problem , which is found to be of the mean - field nature , the following method may be the best choice .",
