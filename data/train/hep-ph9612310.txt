    "the search for the standard model ( ) higgs boson after lep  2 and before a next linear collider ( nlc ) relies on the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the project of a proton - proton collider at cern dates back to the end of the @xmath3 era , when the need of a hadron accelerator operating at the tev scale in order to carefully study the higgs sector of the  clearly came out . at the beginning ,",
    "the lhc was planned as a machine with a beam energy of 7.7 tev and a design luminosity of @xmath4 or more @xcite . since the time of the 1990 large hadron collider workshop @xcite ,",
    "when all the most important physics issues which can be studied at the cern @xmath5 accelerator were addressed in great detail ( higgs physics included ) , both the design of the machine and its foreseen performances have partially evolved .",
    "for example , the centre - of - mass ( cm ) energy has been reduced . in fact , the cern council finally decided in december 1994 that the lhc should be built as a two - stage project .",
    "the first stage being a particle collider with a cm energy of 10 tev , which should be ready to start running in 2004 . in 2008 the lhc should be upgraded by adding magnets to reach the final value @xmath6 tev . not before 1997",
    "it could be re - examined the two stage project , exploiting the possibility of reverting to the immediate construction of a 14 tev accelerator to be ready by 2005 .",
    "this however depends on the availability of sufficient financial commitments .",
    "in addition , the peak design luminosity has decreased as well , to @xmath7 or a factor of ten less . in the meanwhile , also the evolution of the lhc detectors has been greatly carried out , as new technologies have become available in the last six years . in particular , for what concerns higgs physics , special attention has been devoted to the combined performances of : ( i ) the electromagnetic calorimeter and the inner detector , in view of higher mass resolutions in tagging @xmath8 and @xmath9 signals , of more efficient @xmath10 and @xmath11jet separation , and better @xmath12-tagging , especially using low @xmath13 electrons ; ( ii ) the muon chamber and the inner detector for studies of @xmath14 with high mass resolution .",
    "recently , the higgs discovery potential of the lhc has been carefully re - investigated in the technical proposals of the two experimental collaborations that will work at the cern hadron collider : atlas @xcite and cms @xcite . there ,",
    "all the relevant information concerning the design / performances of the machine and of the detectors were also given .",
    "however , concerning the physics aspects of those analyses , a few important features must be noticed : first , predictions were given for the cm energy of 14 tev only ; furthermore , one often finds there slight inconsistencies in the way the signal and background rates were calculated and compared with each other ( leading versus next - to - leading order cross sections , out - of - date parton distributions and parameter values , etc ... ) .",
    "moreover , sometimes event rates were computed using exact matrix element calculations , whereas in other instances monte carlo event generators were used ( such as , e.g. , pythia , herwig , geant @xcite ) .    for this reasons , in ref .",
    "@xcite , cross sections , branching ratios and event rates of signals relevant for higgs phenomenology at the lhc were all recomputed . in that paper ,",
    "all the most recent theoretical results and experimental inputs were included , such as :    * next - to - leading ( nlo ) order corrections to most of the higgs production cross sections and partial decay widths ; * new parton distribution functions , fitted to the high precision data mostly coming from deep inelastic scattering at hera and to the latest measurements of @xmath15 ; * new input parameter values of physical quantities ( in particular the top quark mass @xmath16 ) , obtained from precision measurements performed at lep , tevatron and other machines .",
    "the goal of the analysis carried out there was a set of benchmark results for cross sections and event rates as a function of @xmath17 , for the two ` standard ' lhc collision energies , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the predictions given in ref .",
    "@xcite enable the higgs production and background rates as well as the significance factors used , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , to be normalised to the most up - to - date values .",
    "this paper is , in a sense , the continuation of ref .",
    "@xcite , as it contains an updated signal - to - noise analysis , which takes into account most of the theoretical improvements adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite as well as the new characteristics of the collider discussed above .",
    "however , as already mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , we again stress here that we are not attempting to perform a detailed analysis of signals , backgrounds and search strategies : in this respect , by far the most complete studies to date can still be found in the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite technical proposals .",
    "instead , it is the purpose of the present study to approach the issue of phenomenological studies of higgs signals and backgrounds at the lhc in the most coherent way , preferring _ incompleteness _ to _ inconsistency_. in fact , throughout this paper , only _",
    "exact matrix element computations _ are employed for _ all processes _ , both signal and background events , and no recourse to any monte carlo event generator is done .",
    "not even fragmentation and hadronization phenomena are considered and no special effort in simulating detector effects ( minimum bias events , smearing , pile - up , etc ... ) is done either .",
    "all results are computed and cuts are applied at _",
    "parton level_. in evaluating the feynman amplitude squared of the various processes , if not otherwise stated , we used the packages madgraph @xcite and helas @xcite and the integrator vegas @xcite .",
    "there is however a difference , with respect to ref .",
    "as the most part of the backgrounds studied in literature have not benefited so far from much theoretical effort ( contrary to the higgs processes ) , such that most of them are known at tree ",
    "level only , we have adopted also for the signal rates the leading order ( lo ) results ( contrary to ref .",
    "indeed , in the spirit of the approach we described , we have ` independently ' computed here all background processes using perturbative techniques implementing standard feynman rules .    concerning the numerical part of our work , we have used for the electroweak and qcd input parameters the same values given in ref .",

    ", our discussion will be subdivided into two distinct classes , depending on whether @xmath17 is less than ( i.e. , ` intermediate mass ' range ) or greater than ( i.e. , ` heavy mass ' range ) the @xmath39-decay threshold around @xmath40 .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the most important higgs signatures ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) for a  higgs in the intermediate mass range . that is",
    ", we will proceed by studying the channels :    * ; * ; * @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) ;    and the corresponding backgrounds , where @xmath43 , can give additional chances of higgs detection in the window @xmath44 .",
    "in this case the lack of a measurable narrow resonant peak should be compensated by a relatively large branching ratio , since for the above mass range the @xmath39-channel is the dominant decay mode . ] . in section 3",
    "we concentrate on the heavy mass range , in particular , we will consider the following channels :    * @xmath45 ( @xmath42 ) ; *  ( @xmath42 and @xmath46 ) ;    and again the corresponding backgrounds .",
    "finally , in section 4 we give a short summary and draw our conclusions .",
    "the importance of the rare decay mode @xmath9 has been clearly explained in ref .",
    "the highest rates for this channel occur in the region 80150 gev , where the combination of a rising branching ratio ( see fig .  1 in ref .  @xcite ) and a falling cross - section ( see figs .",
    "5a5b in ref .",
    "@xcite ) yields rates which are remarkably constant over the above range .",
    "as it has been recently outlined that the region 80100 gev could be better probed by the channel @xmath48 , whereas for @xmath49 gev the channel @xmath50 becomes clearly visible , the two - photon decay should remain the best way to search for the higgs boson in the mass interval 100130 gev @xcite .",
    "it has been shown by atlas @xcite that the potential interest of the inclusive channel  ( without isolated and high @xmath13 leptons ) would be limited to the region 80100 gev , and only after several years of data taking at high luminosity . however , since large part of this interval can be covered by lep  2 ( with @xmath51 gev ) and/or di  tevatron ( with @xmath52 tev ) , and since the bulk of the events at high significance would come anyway from the signature @xmath53 ( with an isolated high @xmath13 lepton ) , we do not consider here this case .",
    "somehow more optimistic prospects are given by cms @xcite , which also considered the channel  in association with high @xmath54 jets .",
    "we concentrate here on the associated production of the @xmath55 with a @xmath56-pair or a @xmath57 , followed by the ( semi)leptonic decays @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "these channels have substantially different characteristics with respect to the case of the direct @xmath60 production and decay . on the one hand",
    ", one has the disadvantage of production rates which are one order of magnitude smaller and a larger number of backgrounds ( both reducible and irreducible ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the primary vertex position can be more easily worked out , by using the charged lepton track @xcite and , in addition , the isolated hard lepton from the @xmath57 and @xmath61 decays allows for a very strong reduction of the backgrounds . finally , these advantages can be exploited both at high and low luminosity .    in order to account for the main features of the @xmath62 and @xmath63 signals",
    ", detectors must guarantee the following performances @xcite :    * an electromagnetic calorimeter with excellent stability , uniformity and high energy and angular resolution , in order to extract the very narrow higgs resonance in two photons from the continuum @xmath64 background ; * a large acceptance ; * excellent neutral pions ( giving photons ) rejection , since qcd jets contain one or more leading @xmath65 s ( it has been estimated that a rejection factor @xmath66 should allow one to reduce the qcd backgrounds below the @xmath64 continuum ) ; * powerful capability of the inner tracking system .    a very detailed description of the potential of the lhc detectors needed in order to make feasible to tag the higgs boson in the di - photon channel can be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "although this study dates back at the time of the first lhc workshop ( 1990 ) , nevertheless it still represents an excellent source of informations on this topic .",
    "we certainly refer the reader to that paper . in practice ,",
    "what it is especially needed is that the lhc detectors can maintain an excellent photon energy and angular resolution , while the machine is running at full luminosity .    after applying standard",
    "acceptance cuts ( see below ) , the main backgrounds to the @xmath67 higgs signature via @xmath68 and @xmath69 production have found to be the irreducible processes @xmath70 and @xmath71 we have used the code already employed in ref .",

    "an alternative strategy in searching for the  higgs boson in the intermediate mass range is to look for its main decay channel @xmath48 , by resorting to techniques of @xmath12-flavour identification @xcite , thus reducing the enormous qcd backgrounds of light quark and gluon jets .",

    "because of this and because its signature is relatively clean ( especially if compared to the difficulties encountered for the @xmath133 and @xmath48 cases ) , it is often nicknamed the ` gold - plated channel ' .    if 130 gev @xmath198 , when one of the two @xmath22-boson is off - shell ( i.e. , @xmath199 ) , event rates are generally small ( because of the still suppressed br into the vector - pair ) and the backgrounds can be dangerous ( since the constraint @xmath200 can be applied to only one of the lepton pairs ) . however , in this mass range the higgs width is still quite small ( i.e. , @xmath201 gev ) , therefore , provided that high enough lepton energy / angle resolution can be achieved , a substantial reduction factor on the background should be possible ( in fact , the rates for the latter are directly proportional to the resolution itself ) . also geometric and kinematical acceptances for leptons are crucial in this case @xcite .    in the mass region @xmath202 the main backgrounds to the four - lepton signal of the  higgs boson come from @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 production . in the first two backgrounds two of the leptons come from semi - leptonic @xmath12-decays , whereas the remaining two from the decays of the massive vector bosons ( i.e. , @xmath206 and @xmath127 ) .",
    "we approximated the semileptonic branching fraction of the @xmath12-quark , i.e. , @xmath207 where @xmath135 indicates a generic lepton , via the the one into @xmath208-quarks only ( neglecting then the contribution coming from the decay @xmath209 ) , since the ratio between the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa coefficients entering in the two decays is @xmath210 @xcite .",
    "in computing the semileptonic br of the @xmath12 into @xmath208-quarks we have used the formula @xcite [ bleptonic ] br(bc|_)=(bc|_)_b= ( m_c , m_b)|v_cb|^2_b , where @xmath211 is the partial width , @xmath212 the @xmath12-lifetime ( @xmath213 ps , from the average over @xmath103 hadrons ) and @xmath214 the phase space factor , with @xmath215 @xcite ( the values for @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 were given previously ) .",

    "we notice that the latter constraint is extremely successful in rejecting the huge background coming from @xmath125 production , whereas it does not act on @xmath232 and @xmath205 production .",
    "however , the rates of the latter two processes are largely reduced by the separation criteria . for additional background suppression",

    "in fact , the highest rates occur for @xmath239 gev , value that corresponds to the local maximum in the @xmath240 , whereas smaller rates occur for @xmath118 and 170 gev , the latter value corresponding to the local minimum in the @xmath241-branching ratio ( due to the opening of the real @xmath39-threshold ) .",
    "we verified that the dependence on @xmath16 for the signal is very weak ( see also figs .",

    "the background from @xmath245 is never dominant ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "for the case of the @xmath235 channel , if the high luminosity option can be achieved , it should be possible to observe the higgs boson in the intermediate mass range after one year or so of running , for all combinations of @xmath105 and @xmath166 .",
    "particularly favourable is the case of @xmath246 gev , which should be resolved even for 10 fb@xmath1 , both at 10 and 14 tev of cm energy .",
    "for the lower luminosity option the case @xmath247 gev would present problems , independently of the mass resolution that could be achieved , whereas for @xmath118 gev , this happens if @xmath248 gev , especially at 10 tev .",
    "the four muon case reflects more o less the same characteristics of the total @xmath249 case .",
    "rates are obviously smaller than in the @xmath250 case , however , acceptance criteria generally favour muon cross sections more than electron ones , both for signals and backgrounds .",
    "but whereas for the signal this happens with differences of just a few percents , in the case of the backgrounds the muon decays of the top quarks ( after the above cuts ) are about 40% larger than those into electrons , at fixed @xmath166 and @xmath16 . since top production is in general the dominant background , the final significances for the muon case",
    "are typically smaller than the ones of the @xmath249 case .",
    "therefore , even more in this case , at low luminosity , higgs with masses far away from the local maximum in the @xmath251 at @xmath239 gev , such as at 130 and 170 gev , would be overwhelmed by the background , unless a really good muon resolution can be achieved ( the latter is in fact the chance that induces to consider the four muon decay separately ) . for the case",
    "@xmath252 gev , the recourse to the channel @xmath253 , advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite , might then be providential .",
    "we would like here to conclude this subsection by stressing the importance of the isolation cut on three of the leptons , as this can greatly reduce the @xmath56 background ( of a factor @xmath254 ) and the @xmath255 one ( of a factor @xmath256 ) . at the same time",
    "almost 95% of the @xmath257 and @xmath258 signals pass this cut .",
    "in the case of heavy higgs mass , when the on - shell decay @xmath259 can take place , the only significant background ( after applying the invariant mass cut @xmath260 on both the lepton - antilepton pairs ) is the continuum @xmath241 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we concentrate on this background only . here",
    ", @xmath13 and @xmath261 selection cuts on the four @xmath135 s are the same as in the @xmath205 channel for an intermediate mass higgs .",
    "the sole difference is that in the heavy mass range we drop the requirement of isolation on three leptons , as it was previously implemented in view of reducing the @xmath56 background , which is here negligible compared to the @xmath241 contribution .",
    "the invariant mass @xmath262 for signal and background is shown in figs .   , for a cm energy of 10 and 14 tev ,",
    "the values for @xmath105 here considered are 300 , 500 and 700 gev .",
    "in particular , figs .  9a and 10a clearly show the feasibility of higgs detection for a mass around 300 gev , both at 10 and 14 tev .",
    "for example , the number of signal and background events , for @xmath237 fb@xmath1 , at @xmath0(14 ) tev , is 214(408 ) and 123(102 ) , respectively , in a 70 gev window around the higgs peak ( i.e. , @xmath263 gev , since the total higgs width for @xmath264 gev is equal to @xmath265 gev ) .",
    "even the case of low luminosity ( i.e. , @xmath266 fb@xmath1 ) should allow one to reveal the higgs scalar , after only one year of running .",
    "higgs signals would appear as a broad breit - wigner resonance on top of a decreasing background ( with increasing @xmath105 ) , which has a maximum at @xmath267 .",
    "the case of a higgs scalar with mass around 500 gev also allows for higgs detection , as can be seen by looking at figs .",
    "9b and 10b .",
    "things are more complicated when one considers larger higgs masses , like for example @xmath268 gev ( figs .",
    "for such a value one looses the concept of resonance , as the higgs particle has a width comparable to its mass , i.e. , @xmath269 gev , and the characteristic breit - wigner peak disappears . in this case",
    "the shapes of signal and backgrounds are no longer easily distinguishable , and one has to be extremely careful in normalising the distributions .",
    "for the first stage energy @xmath270 gev , signal and background are hard to recognize ( see fig .",
    "at @xmath6 tev prospects are more optimistic , as here the maximum of the higgs distribution at 700 gev is a factor of three over the @xmath241 background ( see fig .",
    "10c ) . in general , at higher cm energy , higgs detection",
    "should then be feasible both at low and high collider luminosity .",
    "the advantage of the @xmath271 decay channel with respect to @xmath272 is that it has a br which is six times larger .",
    "the disadvantage is that , because of the presence of two neutrinos in the final state , invariant mass peaks around the actual higgs mass value can not be reconstructed .",
    "therefore , this channel prevents from accurate studies of the higgs parameters : e.g. , the width @xmath273 .",
    "the distinctive signature is two high @xmath13 leptons ( from one @xmath22-decay ) and high missing ( transverse ) energy @xmath274 ( from the other @xmath22 ) .",
    "the main backgrounds to the two - lepton - two - neutrino channel are the continuum production of two massive vector bosons ( @xmath80 and @xmath241 ) plus the top - antitop production ( @xmath56 ) and @xmath22 + jets .",

    "appear as broad jacobian peaks in the two - lepton transverse momentum distribution .",
    "to select them we adopt the following procedure @xcite .",

    "11 and 12 show the distribution on the transverse momentum of the lepton pair @xmath283 , after all cuts , for @xmath285 gev , at @xmath0 and 14 tev , respectively , for signal and background .",
    "the dependence on the collider cm is such that at 14 tev one gets significances which are a factor 1.5 greater than at 10 tev , with the number of events doubled .",
    "assuming an integrated luminosity of @xmath286 fb@xmath1 , one obtains ( in the window , say , @xmath287 gev ) 31.7(12.6 ) signal(background ) events at 10 tev .",

    "note that , in order to suppress the @xmath56 background , the additional cut @xmath288 gev has been applied . from figs .",
    "1112 is then clear that both at 10 and at 14 tev extremely good chances of higgs detection ( for masses , say , @xmath289 gev ) exist in the region 400700 gev , although for higher values of the higgs mass things are complicated by the fact that the background has a similar shape , whereas for lower values the peak at soft @xmath290 of the background largely covers the jacobian peaks of the higgs boson .",
    "a different optimisation of the cuts could however extend the mass range of observability of the higgs boson via the channel @xmath271 .",
    "] , by resorting to the two - lepton - two - neutrino channel , already for 10 inverse femtobarns . therefore , different values of @xmath166 do not modify the search strategies of the higgs boson via this channel and have a negligible impacts on the significances in the signal vs. background analysis .",
    "the @xmath271 channel has been claimed to give good chances for higgs detection also for higher values of @xmath17 , in the range 700 gev1 tev .",

    "level perturbative amplitudes ) inadequate to treat conveniently such delicate region of the standard model .",
    "this is why we preferred to restrict our attention to lower values of @xmath105 .",

    ", we have _ consistently _ evaluated both signal and background rates at leading order .",
    "this has been done because the most part of the backgrounds have been so far calculated ( and here independently re - computed ) at two - loops .",
    "] at lowest order only .",
    "results have been given for the two planned cm energies of 10 and 14 tev , and discussed on the basis of the expected integrated luminosity , 10 and/or 100 inverse femtobarns @xmath300 @xmath301 .",
    "what has been assessed here is the substantial complementarity of the decay channels @xmath64 and @xmath120 in the intermediate mass range , as already noticed in ref .",
    "in fact , the latter is the most promising in covering the mass region 80 gev @xmath117 100 gev , whereas the former is better if 100 gev @xmath117 130 gev .",
    "furthermore , the option of high luminosity would make the detection much more feasible for the higgs in the di - photon channel whereas it would reduce the chances via the @xmath120-channel , as in this case both the lepton trigger threshold and the jet @xmath13 threshold would certainly have to be raised in order to compensate the increased trigger rates ( see discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , thus reducing even more the already low rates of both the @xmath68 and @xmath186 signals .",
    "finally , a sort of complementarity exists also among the latter two production mechanisms .",
    "in fact , on the one hand , the @xmath187 signal has a quite small irreducible background in @xmath178 events , whereas this is not the case for @xmath80 events , which have rates competitive with the ones of the @xmath68 signal , if @xmath190 . on the other hand , since the @xmath302 signal is affected by combinatorial background , whereas @xmath303 is not , the identification of higgs signals for @xmath304 is easier in the second case .",
    "all of this is valid for both the energy stages of the lhc , 10 and 14 tev . in the case of poor detector performances",
    ", things would be instead quite complicated . finally ,",
    "as in general ( for these two channels ) the difference between the signal significances at 14 and 10 tev is a factor of approximately 1.31.5 , it should be considered that one should run the machine at 10 tev twice the time that is needed at 14 tev to get to the same threshold of observability of an intermediate mass higgs .",
    "these conclusions , however , largely rely on the fact that the high luminosity option could be achieved in reasonable time for the @xmath64-channel and that the expected performances of the lhc detectors ( especially in photon angular and energy resolution for the @xmath305 case and in @xmath12-tagging for the @xmath120 one ) could be confirmed in practice .    for @xmath306 ,",
    "the below threshold decay channel @xmath199 gives good chances of higgs detection .",
    "for reasonable mass resolutions of the detectors ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) , and if the high luminosity option can be achieved , it should be possible an early observation of the higgs boson , for both values of the collider energy , 10 and 14 tev . as the peak in the @xmath205 branching ratio ( i.e. , below the threshold for two real @xmath22 s ) occurs for @xmath246 gev , the best chances of disentangling the signals would occur for higgs masses around this value , particularly for 10 fb@xmath1 of luminosity .",
    "for such a value of @xmath307 the case @xmath247 gev would present serious problems , independently of the mass resolution , whereas for @xmath118 gev this happens if @xmath248 gev , especially at 10 tev .",
    "the case of four muons reflects more o less the same characteristics of the total @xmath249 case .    for a heavy higgs , with @xmath308",
    ", detection should be guaranteed up to values of @xmath309 gev , via the four - lepton channel . for higgs heavier than , say , 500 gev , the channel @xmath271 will give additional / alternative possibilities .",
    "the only difficult conditions would be in the case of a very heavy higgs boson ( around 700 gev ) , since in this case the corresponding decay width is very large ( of the same order as the mass ) and the particle can not be considered a resonance any longer , such that the shape of the distribution in the invariant mass of the four leptons is the same as the one from the background processes .",
    "this would especially be the case at @xmath0 tev .",
    "in such conditions , the recourse to the channel @xmath271 could turn out to be very useful , as , on the one hand , the corresponding branching ratio is six times larger than that into four leptons ( so event rates would be much larger , thus allowing for larger significances ) whereas , on the other hand , the signal does not suffer so strongly from broadening effects , since this latter is not a breit - wigner peak but a jacobian one due to the kinematics of the higgs .    according to the results of our analysis ,",
    "we conclude that , at the latest after a few years of running at 14 tev ( the long running compensating the possible reduced performances of the detectors ) , the lhc might be able to _ definitely _ asses the correctness of the minimal standard model , or to rule out this with certainty .",
    "moreover , if the expected efficiency of the detectors will be achieved in time , then it might be possible to say something decisive about the standard model already after the first energy stage , around 2005 .    before closing",
    ", we would like to remind the reader two decisive aspects of the analysis that we have been carrying out , which indicate how the results we have obtained should be taken as an _ indication _ of the higgs discovery potential of the lhc at its two planned stages of energy and in dependence of the integrated luminosity , more than as a complete analysis of signals , backgrounds and search strategies .",
    "first , the analysis has been done _ exclusively _ but _ consistently _ at _ parton _ level .",
    "apart from the ( standard ) integration procedure of the differential cross sections , no recourse to any monte carlo technique and/or event generator has been done . only exact _ perturbative",
    "_ matrix element computations have been performed .",
    "hadronization and fragmentation effects , jet clustering procedures , initial and final qcd and qed radiation have not been contemplated , and no special effort has been done in simulating the realistic detector performances ( smearing and pile - up effects , finite efficiency in lepton identification , conversion losses for photons , etc ... ) , other than adopting the usual selection criteria , which can be largely implemented also at parton level ( transverse momenta and ( pseudo)rapidity of leptons and jets , angular separations , missing energy , etc ... ) . therefore , a systematic uncertainty due to the unavoidable differences between parton - level and jet - level procedures come with our results .",
    "the interplay between these two approaches has been carefully investigated and quantified in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the case of the @xmath120 channel . in general , the differences are larger for processes with a complex and various final state topology ( such as the one involving top production and decay ) , and they mainly concern the treatment of hadronic final states , more than the one of leptons and neutrinos .",
    "this observation can be safely extended to involve also the case of the other higgs decay channels ( and relative backgrounds ) .",
    "however , we do not expect the inclusion of all these non - perturbative aspects to wash out the main results that have been assessed here , also because many of the higgs signatures studied in this paper were indeed non - hadronic ( i.e. , @xmath310 ) .",
    "in contrast , many of the inconsistencies that often occur in such kind of analyses ( for example , when nlo order computations are compared to lo results , when out - of - date parton distributions are used , when parton shower approximations are substituted to or interfaced with exact computations , etc ... ) are here totally removed .",
    "second , it has to be remembered that higher order rates for the most part of the backgrounds have not been computed yet .",
    "therefore , especially when proceeding to a signal - to - background analysis at lowest order ( thus avoiding the use of @xmath311-factors for the signals , as it has been done here ) , an overall uncertainty due to the lack of knowledge of next - to - leading order corrections remains .",
    "this has been estimated , for example , for the case of the @xmath68 signal and corresponding backgrounds , in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that their inclusion does not change the final results significantly .",
    "once all the rates needed for a self - consistent signal - to - background analysis will be available at next - to - leading order , very accurate predictions about the prospects of higgs detection and study at the lhc will be given production channel are now well under way @xcite . ] .",
    "it is hard to think , in fact , that next - to - next - to - leading corrections can significantly modify the conclusions obtained at the preceeding order .",
    "possibly , an important exception could be the case of the gluon - gluon fusion process , @xmath312 , for which these could well be large , as the next - to - leading rates differ by @xmath313 from the leading order ones @xcite . because of the crucial role that this production channel has at the lhc , it is important that such corrections are soon investigated .",
    "finally , we remind the reader that the top mass is no longer a significant source of theoretical error in higgs searches , as this particle has been finally identified at fnal and its mass measured rather accurately , i.e. , @xmath314 gev . certainly , there is a residual uncertainty in the predictions involving the production of ( virtual or real ) @xmath61-quarks due to the existing experimental error .",
    "however it has been shown ( see fig .  6 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) that its impact on the higgs production rates is generally small , yielding differences in the cross sections which are generally below @xmath315 .",
    "we have verified that similar effects also occur in the case of the top backgrounds .",
    "the only exceptions are the nlo rates for the signal @xmath312 ( via top loops ) , for which such differences can be as large as 30% ( near the threshold @xmath316 ) .",
    "however , this has a limited phenomenological relevance , as for that value of @xmath17 the higgs signals are well above the backgrounds ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "9a and 10a and compare to the rates given in the two tables of ref .",
    "furthermore , one should remember that by the time the lhc comes into operation the top quark mass will be known with much better precision so that the accuracy in the prediction of top cross sections will be even higher than that discussed in this paper .",
