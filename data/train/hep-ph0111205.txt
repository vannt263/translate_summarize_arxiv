    "there is strong evidence supporting grand unified theories ( gut)@xcite , in which the quarks and leptons are unified in several multiplets in a simple gauge group .",
    "they explain various matters that can not be understood within the standard model : the miracle of anomaly cancellation between quarks and leptons , the hierarchy of gauge couplings , charge quantization , etc .",
    "the three gauge groups in the standard model are unified into a simple gauge group at a gut scale , which is considered to be just below the planck scale . on the other hand , the gut scale destabilizes the weak scale .",
    "one of the most promising ways to avoid this problem is to introduce supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "one of the most important successes of susy is regarded as the gauge coupling unification . in the minimal susy standard model ( mssm ) , three gauge couplings meet at a single scale @xmath2 gev .",
    "however , it is not easy to obtain a realistic susy gut.@xcite first , it is difficult to obtain realistic fermion mass matrices in a simple way .",
    "in particular , unification of quarks and leptons puts strong constraints on the yukawa couplings .",
    "but concerning the fermion masses , recent progress in neutrino experiments@xcite provides important information on family structure .",
    "there are several impressing works@xcite in which the large neutrino mixing angle is realized within gut framework .",
    "it is now natural to examine @xmath1 and higher gauge groups , because they allow for every quark and lepton , including the right - handed neutrino , to be unified in a single multiplet , which is important in addressing neutrino masses .",
    "second , one of the most difficult obstacles is the  doublet - triplet(dt ) splitting problem \" .",
    "generally , a fine - tuning is required to obtain the light @xmath5 doublet higgs multiplet of the weak scale while keeping the triplet higgs sufficiently heavy to suppress the dangerous proton decay .",
    "there have been several attempts to solve this problem.@xcite among them , the dimopoulos - wilczek mechanism is a promising way to realize dt splitting in the @xmath1 susy gut.@xcite    finally , there is a rather theoretical problem , which has not been emphasized so much in the literature .",
    "if we adopt an ajoint higgs field @xmath6 to break the gut gauge group , the superpotential is generically given by @xmath7 . in the vacua , the gut gauge group is generically broken to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the rank of the gut gauge group .",
    "it is unnatural to obtain the standard gauge group @xmath10 by this superpotential . at least for @xmath11 unification",
    ", we can impose renormalizability to avoid this problem .",
    "then the superpotential becomes @xmath12 , which naturally gives the standard gauge group below the gut scale .",
    "however , for @xmath1 or @xmath13 unification , it is not workable because @xmath14 is not allowed under the gauge symmetry .",
    "moreover , in the context of wilsonian renormalization group , renormalizability is not a principle to be imposed , but a resulting feature which low energy effective theories happen to obtain .",
    "when the cutoff scale is much higher than the typical scale of the theory , higher dimensional operators become irrelevant , and only a few operators are important to determine the low energy physics . however , since the gut scale is near the planck scale , it is not natural to impose the renormalizability on the grand unified theories",
    ". therefore we have to answer the question why the non - abelian gauge group remains at the low energy scale , or , why the allowed interactions in the superpotential are restricted .",
    "recently we proposed a scenario of @xmath1 ( also @xmath13 ) grand unified theory ( gut ) with anomalous @xmath0 gauge symmetry@xcite , which has the following interesting features ;    1 .",
    "the interaction is generic , namely , all the interactions , which are allowed by the symmetry , are introduced .",
    "therefore , once we fix the field contents with their quantum numbers ( integer ) , all the interactions are determined except the coefficients of order one .",
    "2 .   even with generic interaction ,",
    "non - abelian gauge group at the low energy scale can be obtained .",
    "( necessary restriction to the superpotential is realized by susy zero mechanism . )",
    "the dimopoulos - wilczek mechanism , which realizes the doublet - triplet ( dt ) splitting , is naturally embedded .",
    "the proton decay via the dimension - five operator is suppressed .",
    "realistic quark and lepton mass matrices can be obtained in a simple way . in particular , in the neutrino sector , bi - large neutrino mixing is realized .",
    "the symmetry breaking scales are determined by the anomalous @xmath0 charges .",
    "the mass spectrum of the super heavy particles is fixed by the anomalous @xmath0 charges .    as a consequence of the above features , the fact that the gut scale is smaller than the planck scale leads to modification of the undesired gut relation between the yukawa couplings @xmath15 ( and also @xmath16 ) while preserving @xmath17 .",
    "the anomalous @xmath0 gauge symmetry,@xcite whose anomaly is cancelled by the green - schwarz mechanism,@xcite plays an essential role in explaining the dt splitting mechanism at the unification scale and the restriction of the interactions in the superpotential as well as in reproducing yukawa hierarchies@xcite . unfortunately to solve the dt splitting problem ,",
    "several super - heavy particles become lighter than the gut scale . generically",
    ", the existence of these fields destroys the success of the gauge coupling unification .",
    "however , the spectrum of the super heavy particles are determined by the anomalous @xmath0 charges , we can calculate the running gauge couplings and easily examine whether these couplings meet at an unified scale or not .",
    "in other words , requirement of gauge coupling unification gives some constraints on the anomalous @xmath0 charges . in this paper",
    ", we examine the constraints and try to find out models in which gauge coupling unification is realized .",
    "it is suggestive that when all the other fields but those of the mssm become super - heavy , only a condition leads to the gauge coupling unification .",
    "it is interesting that the cutoff scale becomes the usual gut scale @xmath3 and the unified scale becomes just below the scale @xmath3 .    in section 2 , we explain how the susy vacua are determined in the anomalous @xmath0 framework . using this argument , we recall the discussion of the dt splitting mechanism in section 3 , and the resulting mass spectrum of super - heavy particles in section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "we review how to determine the anomalous @xmath0 charges to realize quark and lepton mass matrices and bi - large neutrino mixing angles .",
    "these have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in section 6",
    ", we briefly explain how to solve the @xmath18 problem in our scenario , following the discussion in ref .  @xcite . in section 7",
    ", we discuss the conditions for gauge coupling unification and in section 8 , we examine several models in which these conditions are satisfied .",
    "in this section , we explain how the vacua of the higgs fields are determined by the anomalous @xmath0 quantum numbers .",
    "first , we show that none of the fields with positive anomalous @xmath0 charge acquire non - zero vev if the froggatt - nielsen ( fn ) mechanism @xcite acts effectively in the vacuum . for simplicity ,",
    "we here introduce just gauge singlet fields @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) with charges @xmath21 ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) . from the @xmath24-flatness conditions of the superpotential , we get @xmath25 equations plus one @xmath26-flatness condition , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the coefficient of fayet - iliopoulos @xmath26-term and @xmath29 is a cutoff scale of the theory . throughout this paper",
    "we use a unit in which @xmath30 and denote all the superfields with uppercase letters and their anomalous @xmath0 charges with the corresponding lowercase letters . at first glance , these look to be over determined .",
    "however , the @xmath24-flatness conditions are not independent , because the gauge invariance of the superpotential @xmath31 leads to the relation @xmath32 therefore , generically a susy vacuum with @xmath33 exists ( vacuum a ) , because the coefficients of the above conditions are generically of order 1 .",
    "if @xmath34 , we can choose another vacuum ( vacuum b ) with @xmath35 , which automatically satisfies the @xmath24-flatness conditions @xmath36 . then the @xmath37 are determined by the @xmath24-flatness conditions @xmath38 with the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) and the @xmath26-flatness condition @xmath39 .",
    "note that if @xmath40 ( in this paper , we take @xmath41 ) , the vevs of @xmath42 are less than the cutoff scale .",
    "this can lead to the froggatt - nielsen mechanism .",
    "if we fix the normalization of @xmath0 gauge symmetry so that the largest value @xmath43 in the negative charges @xmath44 equals -1 , then the vev of the field @xmath45 is determined from @xmath39 as @xmath46 , which breaks @xmath0 gauge symmetry .",
    "( we explain later why we take the field @xmath45 with the largest charges @xmath43 . ) in the following , we denote the froggatt - nielsen field @xmath45 as @xmath47 . on the other hand , other vevs are determined by the @xmath24-flatness conditions of @xmath48 as @xmath49 , which is shown below .",
    "since @xmath35 , it is sufficient to examine the terms linear in @xmath48 in the superpotential in order to determine @xmath37 . therefore , in general the superpotential to determine the vevs can be written @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath24-flatness conditions of the @xmath48 fields require @xmath53 which generally lead to solutions @xmath54 if these @xmath24-flatness conditions determine the vevs .",
    "thus the f - flatness condition requires @xmath55 note that if @xmath56 , generically all the vevs of @xmath42 are fixed , therefore there appears no flat direction in the potential .",
    "it means that there is no massless field . on the other hand , if @xmath57 , generally the @xmath58 equations of @xmath24-flatness and @xmath26-flatness conditions do not determine all the vevs of @xmath59 fields @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , there are flat directions in the potential , namely there must be some massless fields . roughly speaking ,",
    "if we would like to realize no massless mode in the higgs sector , @xmath56 must be imposed in higgs sector .- flatness conditions is reduced as realized in this section by taking @xmath60 .",
    "such a structure is easily realized by imposing some symmetry , for example , @xmath61 parity or r parity .",
    "however , it is obvious that @xmath62 is required to make all the higgs fields super - heavy . ]    here we have examined the vevs of singlets fields , but generally the gauge invariant operator @xmath63 with negative charge @xmath64 has non - vanishing vev @xmath65 if the @xmath24-flatness conditions determine the vev . for example , let us introduce spinors @xmath66 and @xmath67 of @xmath1 .",
    "the vev of the gauge singlet operator @xmath68 is estimated as @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath26-flatness condition of @xmath1 gauge theory requires @xmath70 note that these vevs are also determined by the anomalous @xmath0 charges but they are different from the naive expectation @xmath71 .",
    "this is because the @xmath26-flatness condition plays an important role to fix the vevs .",
    "note that if there is another field @xmath42 which has smaller charge than the fn field @xmath45 , then the vev of @xmath42 becomes larger than the @xmath72 , which is inconsistent with @xmath26-flatness condition .",
    "therefore we have to take the field with the largest negative charge as the fn field .",
    "if vacuum a is selected , the anomalous @xmath0 gauge symmetry is broken at the planck scale , and the fn mechanism does not act .",
    "therefore , we can not know the existence of the @xmath0 gauge symmetry from the low energy physics . on the other hand , if vacuum b is selected , the fn mechanism acts effectively and we can understand the signature of the @xmath0 gauge symmetry from the low energy physics .",
    "therefore , it is natural to assume that vacuum b is selected in our scenario , in which the @xmath0 gauge symmetry plays an important role for the fn mechanism .",
    "the vevs of the fields @xmath48 vanish , which guarantees that the susy zero mechanism invariance forbids the operator in the superpotential since the field @xmath47 with negative charge can not compensate for the negative total charge of the operator ( susy zero mechanism ) .",
    "] acts effectively .    in summary ,    1 .",
    "gauge singlet operators with positive total charge have vanishing vevs , in order that the fn mechanism acts effectively .",
    "this guarantees that the susy zero mechanism works well .",
    "the @xmath24-flatness conditions of fields with positive charges determine the vevs of singlet operators @xmath63 with negative total charges @xmath64 as @xmath65 , while the @xmath24-flatness conditions of fields with negative charges are automatically satisfied .",
    "3 .   if the number of the fields with positive charges equals to that of the fields with negative charges , generically no massless field appears .",
    "4 .   general superpotential to determine the vevs is the following structure @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is linear in the field @xmath48 with positive charges .",
    "in this section , we review the mechanism which naturally realizes the doublet - triplet splitting in @xmath1 unified scenario @xcite .    the contents of the higgs sector with @xmath75 gauge symmetry is given in table i , where the symbols @xmath76 denote @xmath61 parity quantum numbers .",
    "table i. the typical values of anomalous @xmath0 charges are listed .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in our scenario , the unification scale @xmath77 , the symmetry breaking scale @xmath78 and the determinants of the reduced mass matrices are fixed by the anomalous @xmath0 charges ; @xmath79 the unification conditions @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are rewritten as @xmath83 which lead to @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "so the unification condition becomes @xmath87 , and then the cutoff scale must be taken as @xmath88 .",
    "note that these relation are independent on the anomalous @xmath0 charges except that of the doublet higgs .",
    "it implies that this result can be applied to rather general cases . on the other hand , we should not take this relation @xmath87 seriously because we have an ambiguity of order one coefficients and use only one loop renormalization group equations .",
    "however , in order to catch the tendency , the above analysis is fairly useful .    before going to the discussion of model buildings , it is useful to examine the reason to obtain the above result .",
    "the essential point appears in estimating the ratio of determinants of mass matrices between the components in the same multiplet of @xmath11 gauge group . note that in eqs .",
    "( [ detq])@xmath89([detx ] ) , the powers are given by simple sums of the anomalous @xmath0 charges .",
    "therefore , the ratio @xmath90 can be easily estimated from the trivial relation @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the total charge of massless modes ( a pair of doublet higgs fields ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath93 is also determined by the relation @xmath94 , where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the total charges of massless modes ( nambu - goldstone ( ng ) modes which appear by breaking @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively . )",
    "the ratio @xmath99 is calculated by the relation @xmath100 , where @xmath95 is the total charge of massless modes ( ng modes which appear by breaking @xmath97 . ) .",
    "it is interesting that all the effect of massless modes except higgs doublet are cancelled out in deriving the conditions for the gauge coupling unification .",
    "it means that it is not accidental to realize the coupling unification in our scenario though the cutoff scale becomes around @xmath2 gev and the unification scale becomes @xmath101 .",
    "( so we can not take @xmath102 , because of proton stability . )",
    "actually we have no solution to realize the coupling unification if dt splitting does not happen ( i.e. , @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) .",
    "therefore this result is non - trivial and it is stimulating that the proton decay via dimension six operator may be seen in future because the unification scale must be smaller than the usual unification scale @xmath2 gev .    from these estimation , it is obvious that the charges of massless modes are essential to examine whether gauge couplings are unified at a scale or not .",
    "it is independent on the detail of the contents of higgs sector .",
    "therefore we can formally examine the possibility of gauge coupling unification without building models of higgs sector explicitly .",
    "for example , to examine the case in which other massless modes than one pair of higgs doublet appear , it is sufficient to take account of the anomalous @xmath0 charges of the massless modes . unfortunately we could not find natural example in which coupling unification of gauge couplings and dt splitting are realized .",
    "for example , if we introduce an additional adjoint field with negative charge , the additional massless modes @xmath105 and @xmath31 appear .",
    "the masses are controlled by the susy breaking terms , so are expected to be around the susy breaking scale .",
    "( strictly speaking , we can compute the mass scale , using the same mechanism for the @xmath18 problem as discussed in section 6 . )",
    "then we can calculate the running flow of the gauge couplings and examine whether coupling unification happens or not .",
    "since the ratios of the mass determinants are given by @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the mass of the massless mode of @xmath105 and @xmath108 is the charge of the massless fields @xmath105 and @xmath31 , the above conditions for coupling unification become @xmath109 these equations lead to unrealistic relation @xmath110 .",
    "in the next section , we will find out several models in which the condition for the gauge coupling unification @xmath87 is almost satisfied .",
    "in this section , we examine the cases in which all the fields become massive except one pair of higgs doublets . then unification scale becomes @xmath101 as discussed in the previous section .",
    "so we should take @xmath111 to stabilize nucleon . then @xmath112 or 4 because the term @xmath113 must be forbidden and the term @xmath114 is required .",
    "the unification condition is @xmath87 , but we have to take negative @xmath115 to forbid the higgs mass term @xmath116 .",
    "therefore we would like to know how large negative charge @xmath117 can be adopted in our scenario .",
    "necessary conditions for realizing dt splitting and bi - large neutrino mixing @xmath118 are @xmath119 the third and forth conditions are required because the terms @xmath120 and @xmath121 are needed in our scenario . since the cutoff scale @xmath122 gev",

    "@xcite and the recent result of the lattice calculation for the hadron matrix element parameter @xmath152@xcite @xmath153 the lifetime of the proton in these cases becomes @xmath154 because the unification scale is around @xmath155 gev .",
    "it is interesting that this value of the lifetime is just around the present experimental limit @xcite @xmath156 of course , since we have an ambiguity of order one coefficients and of the hadron matrix element parameter @xmath152 , and the lifetime of proton is strongly dependent on the gut scale and the parameter , this prediction may not be so reliable .",
    "however , the above rough estimation gives us a strong motivation for experiments of proton decay search , because the lifetime of nucleon via dimension six operator must be less than that in the usual susy gut scenario .",

    "in this paper , we have examined the conditions for gauge coupling unification with the anomalous @xmath0 gauge theory and discussed several models which satisfy the conditions . since the unification scale and the spectrum of super - heavy particles are determined only by the anomalous @xmath0 charges , the unification conditions are described by the charges .",

    "<S> recently we proposed a natural scenario of grand unified theories with anomalous @xmath0 gauge symmetry , in which doublet - triplet splitting is realized in @xmath1 unification using dimopoulos - wilczek mechanism and realistic quark and lepton mass matrices can be obtained in a simple way . </S>",
    "<S> the scenario has an additional remarkable feature that the symmetry breaking scale and the mass spectrum of super heavy particles are determined essentially by anomalous @xmath0 charges . </S>",
    "<S> therefore once all the anomalous @xmath0 charges are fixed , the gauge coupling flows can be calculated . </S>",
    "<S> we examine several models in which the gauge coupling unification is realized . examining the conditions for the coupling unification , we show that when all the fields except those of the minimal susy standard model become super - heavy , the unification scale generically becomes just below the usual gut scale @xmath2 gev and the cutoff scale becomes around @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> since the lower gut scale leads to shorter life time of nucleon , the proton decay via dimension six operator @xmath4 can be seen in future experiment . on the other hand , the lower cutoff scale than the planck scale may imply the existence of extra dimension in which only gravity modes can propagate .    </S>",
