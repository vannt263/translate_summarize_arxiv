    "since its identification @xcite , the thick disk has been shown to have distinct kinematics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a distinct metallicity distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from the stellar halo and thin disk of the milky way galaxy .",
    "the formation history of the thick disk can provide constraints on the origins and formation of the thin disk and halo , and ultimately the milky way galaxy itself .",
    "the formation mechanism of the thick disk , however , has been the subject of much discussion for decades .    soon after the discovery of the thick disk , @xcite proposed that early star formation in a thin disk , which formed before the galactic potential reached virial equilibrium , could be subsequently flattened by violent relaxation to form the thick disk",
    "later , @xcite showed that a thick disk could be formed as the result of a rapid , dissipational collapse accompanied by star formation .",
    "the first model to gain traction , however , was that in which a pre - existing thin stellar disk is heated by a merger with a fairly robust and massive satellite , around @xmath7 the mass of the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the thick disk is then formed primarily from the stars in the ` thickened ' disk , while some stars are directly accreted from the satellite galaxy .",
    "more recently , this model was extended to include cosmologically motivated heating by accretion and merging from many satellites @xcite , however , the most massive satellites still dominate the heating .",
    "another model has the thick disk forming from the direct accretion of stars from satellite galaxies @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the thick disk could have formed during a period of rapid star formation associated with multiple minor , gas - rich mergers @xcite . in this model",
    ", the majority of the thick disk stars are formed from the accreted gas in the primordial disk , with a small minority being directly accreted during the mergers .",
    "models that have more recently gained traction are those that do not necessarily require a merger history to the formation of the thick disk . instead",
    ", the thick disk could have formed from stars that have radially migrated outward from the inner disk by resonant scattering by transient spiral arms @xcite .",
    "another model , proposed by @xcite , has the thick disk forming from internal gas clumps in the disk at high redshift .    what is the best way to distinguish these models ?",
    "the distributions of kinematics and metallicity provide some discriminants , and these differ between the models most strongly at the metal - poor end . while there is clearly not a simple one - to - one relationship between age and metallicity , the most metal - poor stars in general formed early , in every scenario .",
    "elemental abundance patterns reveal even more detailed information about the star formation history and chemical evolution of a stellar population .",
    "the ratio of @xmath4-elemental ( e.g. , mg , si , ca , and ti ) abundances to iron abundance is sensitive to the relative numbers of core - collapse type ii supernovae ( sne  ii ) and type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) that have occurred in the past .",
    "the @xmath4-elements are primarily synthesized in massive stars and ejected in sne  ii on short timescales ( @xmath8  yr ) after the formation of the progenitor star , with the ratio of @xmath0=\\log[n({\\rm a})/n({\\rm b})]-\\log[n({\\rm a})/n({\\rm b})]_{\\odot}$ ] . ] from any one sne  ii depending on the mass of the progenitor massive star @xcite .",
    "sne  ia , which result from white dwarf remnants in intermediate mass binary systems with mass transfer , are major sources of iron ( and not @xmath4-elements ) and occur on longer time scales than sne  ii .",
    "the actual distribution of explosion timescales depends on the details of the model for the progenitors of type  ia sne , but the onset is always later than that of type  ii sne , and there are always explosions several gyr after the initial star formation ( e.g. matteucci et al .",
    "2009 ) .    a self - enriching system",
    "will then show enhanced @xmath0 ratios ( compared to the sun ) early in the star - formation process , when enrichment is dominated by core - collapse sne  ii , and the actual enhancement is determined by the initial mass function ( imf ) of massive stars ( assuming good mixing of the interstellar medium , ism , and a well - sampled imf ) .",
    "stars formed after significant contributions from sne  ia to the ism ( @xmath9  yr after the first star formation episode ) will have considerably more iron enrichment , and so they will have decreased @xmath0 ratios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the models can therefore be tested using a sample of metal - poor ( @xmath10 ) thick disk stars that probe a volume out to several kiloparsec around the sun .",
    "high resolution spectroscopic observations of each star is necessary to determine the detailed abundances of the @xmath4-elements in each star .",
    "we identified for study a sample of candidate metal - poor stars in the thick disk selected from the radial velocity experiment survey ( rave , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and observed this sample with high resolution echelle spectrographs at several facilities around the world .    in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter r10 ) , we derived several @xmath0 ratios for a subsample of red giant branch ( rgb ) and red clump / horizontal branch ( rc / hb ) stars from our full candidate metal - poor thick - disk sample .",
    "we found a significant fraction of these stars ( @xmath11 ) to be most consistent with the thick disk .",
    "the abundances of these metal - poor thick - disk stars had high @xmath0 ratios , consistent with rapid star formation , which agrees with previous studies of much smaller samples of metal - poor thick - disk stars @xcite .",
    "further , we found that the @xmath0 ratios were indistinguishable from those of the halo , indicating that the halo and the thick disk shared a similar massive star imf and similar efficient mixing of enriched material into the interstellar medium .",
    "the high @xmath0 ratios of the metal - poor thick - disk giants provided constraints on those models of the formation of the thick disk that are driven by direct accretion of stars from satellite galaxies .",
    "stars in present - day milky way satellites have lower values of @xmath0 at a given @xmath12 ( for @xmath13 ) than the stars of the stellar halo , thick disk , or thin disk ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this is understood in terms of the differences in the star formation histories of the stellar populations ( as described above ) , with the dwarf galaxies having very slow enrichment , and strongly non - monotonic star formation rates . in the models that include direct accretion of stars",
    ", accretion takes place well beyond 1  gyr after the initial star formation episode .",
    "this implies that if each satellite had star formation rates similar to surviving dwarfs , then the accreted stars would have formed after significant iron contribution from sne  ia , and thus would have low @xmath0 ratios . from this",
    "we concluded that dwarf galaxies similar to present - day dwarf galaxies did not play a major role in the formation of the thick disk .",
    "further analysis , however , is needed to distinguish those models that do not include a significant fraction of accreted stars from satellite galaxies .",
    "these models all have early , rapid star formation , consistent with high @xmath0 ratios . a useful",
    "diagnostic is the amplitude of the radial and vertical abundance gradients predicted by the models .",
    "for example , the gas - rich merger model predicts more uniform chemical abundances , while low - amplitude vertical gradients are possible in the heating scenario .",
    "slow , dissipational settling , on the other hand , would produce a significant vertical gradient in metallicity , as well as a possible vertical gradient in the @xmath0 ratios .    in this work ,",
    "we extend the analysis from r10 to our entire sample of metal - poor thick - disk candidates .",
    "we further augment that study with a detailed analysis of the abundance gradients in the thick disk .",
    "in  2 and  3 , we briefly describe the candidate selection and high resolution spectroscopic observations . in ",
    "4 we describe our stellar parameter analysis .",
    "we give a full description of our distance estimation techniques in  5 , and briefly discuss our population assignments in  6 ( a full description can be found in r10 ) . in ",
    "7 we report on the abundance correlations and gradients seen in the data for our full sample , and show that our conclusions from r10 have not changed by including the dwarfs and sub - giants in our sample .",
    "we further quantify our abundance results using imf - weighted yields in  9 .",
    "we then use orbital eccentricities of our sample stars in  10 to distinguish further the models of the formation of the thick disk .",
    "finally , we discuss our findings in  11 and conclude in  12 .",
    "as in r10 , all candidate stars were first selected from the internal rave catalog ( version dr2 ) to have calibrated metallicities @xmath14_{\\rm cal}}<-0.7 $ ] ( for more details on the calibration , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath15 values between 4000  k and 6500  k. the low temperature cut was applied to reduce contamination from metal - rich giant stars and m - dwarfs .",
    "stars hotter than 6500  k have a higher likelihood of being rapid rotators and may also have larger non - lte effects , which could affect our elemental abundance analysis ( as described below ) . those stars that met these parameter constraints and had the highest probability of being thick disk stars according to their kinematics ( based on the rave parameters and our distance estimates , for which the procedure is described below ) were selected for high resolution spectroscopic observations .",
    "observations were conducted during the period between 2007 may and 2009 february .",
    "all high resolution spectra were obtained using one of the following echelle spectrographs : mike @xcite on the magellan - clay telescope at las campanas observatory in chile , feros @xcite on the mpg 2.2-m telescope at eso la silla observatory in chile , ucles @xcite on the anglo - australian telescope in australia , and the arc echelle spectrograph @xcite on the apache point 3.5-m telescope in new mexico , this last facility for stars visible from the northern hemisphere .",
    "the instumental set - ups gave resolving powers between 35,000 - 45,000 , providing complete spectral coverage from to , except for ucles which had complete spectral coverage between and .",
    "the echelle spectral data were reduced following the same procedures as described in r10 .",
    "the final reduced spectra all yielded an s / n ratio greater than 100  @xmath16 at and a minimum @xmath17 around , which is sufficient for detailed elemental abundance analysis .",
    "our full sample of metal - poor thick - disk candidate stars consists of the sample from r10 ( 212 rgb stars and 31 rc / hb stars ) and 74 main - sequence or sub - giant ( ms / sg ) stars .",
    "an additional 2 rgb stars were discovered during the analysis of the ms / sg stars , bringing our total to 319 candidate metal - poor thick disk stars with high resolution spectroscopic observations . as indicated in r10 ,",
    "ten of these candidates ( 5 rgb and 5 ms / sg ) were observed twice for internal consistency checks .",
    "table  [ tab - obs ] lists the observational data for the sample .",
    "the full sample has heliocentric radial velocities derived from the echelle spectra that differ from those in the rave database by an average @xmath18  .",
    "figure  [ fig - vradcomp ] shows the distribution of the differences in the radial velocity estimates .",
    "the standard deviation of the rave radial velocities is of the order of 2.5  , which is slightly lower than that of our comparison .",
    "we cross - checked our final sample with the list of spectroscopic binary stars found in the rave survey by @xcite , and found no matches .",
    "those stars with differences of 10 - 15  could possibly be in low - amplitude , single - lined binary systems in which the primary to secondary ratio is about 5 - 10 to one .",
    "this type of binary system would not have a significant effect on our subsequent analysis and results and we retained these stars .",
    "the coverage in galactic @xmath19 coordinates of our final sample is illustrated in figure  [ fig - coord ] .",
    "rave mainly targeted fields at galactic latitudes greater than @xmath20 ( only targeting a few low - latitude fields ) , which is why there are very few stars with @xmath21 in our sample .",
    "it is clear that our sample of metal - poor thick - disk candidates does not have the same completeness as the entire rave sample from which we selected our candidates .",
    "figure  [ fig - mag ] compares the distribution of the rave internal @xmath22-magnitude of our sample to that of the entire rave sample .",
    "most of our stars lie between @xmath23 , about a half magnitude brighter than typical for the parent rave sample .",

    "in addition , the fit technique for the rgb stars described above can result in unphysical solutions in this region . the percent error in the @xmath15 value of a star is typically much smaller than that of the @xmath28 values , implying the probability distribution close to the to region can be double - peaked . for example , a star with a gravity that lies to the right of the to point on an isochrone will have a probability peak on the ms - branch as well as one on the sg - branch .",
    "this will cause any weighted averaging of the isochrones to choose the most probable fit to be a point not on the isochrone itself , which is physically impossible .",
    "we , therefore , employed a different method for finding distances to our ms / sg stars to reduce this effect .    instead of fitting to isochrones , we estimated the absolute @xmath58 magnitude by assuming a mass , using the definition of effective temperature and adopting a bolometric correction for each ms / sg star , which is given by : @xmath85 where @xmath86  k , @xmath87",

    "a mass of 0.8  implies that the star is old , while adopting a mass of 1.0  implies that the star is younger . comparing a star s position in the @xmath28 versus @xmath15 plane to a 4  gyr and 12  gyr isochrone , we can determine a reasonable mass estimate .",
    "this is described in more detail below .",
    "an estimate of the reddening to a given star was computed during the procedure to obtain a distance by the following method .",
    "the @xcite dust maps and extinction calculator were initially used to calculate reddening to infinity in a specific line - of - sight .",
    "@xcite found that @xcite overestimate the reddening when @xmath92 , and 52 of our candidate stars meet this criterion .",

    "several stars ( especially ms / sg stars ) are close enough to lie within the galactic dust distribution , and thus the reddening should be reduced . adopting a simple exponential model for the dust , with a scale - height of @xmath95  pc @xcite , the reddening to a star at distance @xmath96 and galactic longitude @xmath97 is reduced by a factor @xmath98 .",
    "the reddening was recomputed iteratively until the difference between the current estimate of the distance and the previous one was less than 2 percent .",
    "@xcite assumed a @xmath99 extinction curve to compute extinction coefficients in other passbands .",
    "they do not , however , derive values for the 2mass passbands",
    ". we determined our extinction coefficients by assuming the extinction coefficients from @xcite , @xmath100 the mean values of @xmath101 and @xmath102 for our sample are both less than 0.1 , with errors less than 0.1  mag .",
    "an error of 0.1  mag in reddening will only cause a @xmath103 shift in distance , which is within our error estimates described below .",
    "we adopted the estimate of 20% error on the distance to rgb and rc / hb stars from r10 , which was based on comparisons between our estimates and literature estimates for the globular cluster stars and estimates for the f00 rgb stars derived from _",

    "there are , however , several stars with @xmath104 that could have younger ages .",
    "if we assume all of the stars are old , and choose a mass of 0.8  , then the distance estimates from our technique differ from those derived from the _ hipparcos _ parallaxes by only @xmath105 . increasing the mass to 0.9  and 1.0  increases the difference to @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "it is important to notice that if we increase the mass to one that is intermediate between older and younger ages , then the difference only increases by 6% , which is well within the scatter .",
    "figure  [ fig - dwarf ] shows the same plots as figure  [ fig - hipdwarf ] , except we now plot our metal - poor sample ms / sg stars .",
    "it is clear that all stars with @xmath10 are old .",

    "we assume a mass of 1.0  for the two stars with @xmath108 close to the 4  gyr isochrone ( @xmath109 ) , while we adopt 0.8  for the remaining stars in that bin . those stars with @xmath110 show no clear separation in age .",
    "we therefore chose an intermediate mass of 0.9  for all ms / sg stars with @xmath110 .",
    "if we apply the above prescriptions to the f00 ms / sg stars , we find a difference between our bolometric distances and the distances derived from parallaxes to be only @xmath111 .",
    "we therefore adopt a 20% error on the distances to our ms / sg stars ( similarly to the giants and rc / hb stars ) , so as to include both offsets and scatter .",
    "distance estimates based on rave pipeline values of stellar parameters are also now available @xcite .",
    "our distance estimates for the 172 giant stars with @xmath112 are shorter than those of @xcite by @xmath113 , while the 73 ms / sg stars have distances shorter by @xmath114 .",

    "it is important to note that only one realization , with a specific set of initial conditions , for each formation scenario was used to compute the eccentricity distributions .",
    "this is , however , sufficient since there is no reason that the given simulations are not representative of that scenario .",
    "it is important to note that we can not use our population assignments when constructing the distribution of orbital eccentricities for the thick disk .",
    "the shape and extent of the tail of the thick - disk distribution is biased by our _ definition _ of ` thick disk ' during our population analysis .",
    "we simulated our analysis by creating 1000 model stars in which their distance and galactic coordinates were randomly chosen assuming a uniform distribution , and their 3-dimensional space motion was randomly selected using the ` thick disk ' gaussian definition in table  [ tab - gaus ] .",
    "each model star was then run through our orbital program to determine the orbital eccentricity .",
    "only 12% of these model thick disk stars had @xmath179 , which indicates that our definition of thick disk does not allow for many stars on highly eccentric orbits .",
    "further , this could also affect the shape of the right side of the eccentricity distributions .",
    "we therefore followed the procedure of s09 to investigate the orbital eccentricities of our metal - poor thick disk sample stars , calculated in  [ velorb ] for the last orbit of a star . in this case , we computed the @xmath134-distribution of stars with @xmath180  and @xmath181 , where @xmath182  kpc .",
    "this distribution is shown in figure  [ fig - esales ] . to estimate the effects of distance errors on the distribution",
    ", we also plot the resultant eccentricity distribution when distances are increased and decreased by 20% .",
    "the majority of the stars in this sample appear to exhibit low orbital eccentricities , with the distribution peaking around @xmath183 .",
    "our distribution does not show a strong resemblance to any of the distributions found in s09 .",
    "the tail to high eccentricity somewhat resembles that of the direct accretion scenario of @xcite .",
    "the peak at lower eccentricities is significantly lower than predicted by the direct accretion scenario , and is more consistent with the predictions of models wherein the stars of the thick disk were primarily formed _ in situ_. it is possible that we are under - sampling the low - eccentricity bins since we do not have many stars at the peak of the thick - disk metallicity distribution , @xmath140 .",
    "it is likely that including more metal - rich thick - disk stars could significantly change the distribution of eccentricities .",
    "in this work , we analyzed our full sample of metal - poor thick disk candidate stars .",
    "the ms / sg stars , added to our giant star sample from r10 , were primarily assigned to the thin disk and thin / thick populations , and increased the number of stars with @xmath110 .",
    "we found that our findings from r10 were unchanged , in that the @xmath0 ratios for the metal - poor thick - disk stars are enhanced and show low scatter ( @xmath184  dex , within the error of 0.1  dex ) , indicating that star formation took place on a short timescale in which the metal - poor thick disk was pre - enriched by core - collapse sne from an invariant massive star imf .",
    "further , the metal - poor thick disk and halo were most likely pre - enriched by the same massive star imf , showing a difference in @xmath4-enhancement of @xmath185  dex .",
    "the low amplitude of scatter in the element ratios indicates that the ism from which the stars formed was well - mixed .",
    "as discussed in r10 , the enhancement and low scatter of @xmath0 in the thick disk are evidence that the formation of the thick disk had little influence by the late , direct accretion of stars from dwarf galaxies .",
    "the @xmath4-enhancement in the metal - poor thick disk contrasts with the expectations from models that have direct accretion up until about @xmath186  gyr ago ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , assuming that the accreted dwarfs formed stars and self - enriched similarly to the surviving dwarfs . in this case , the stars accreted would then look chemically different from our metal - poor thick - disk stars ( see r10 ) .",
    "further , the distribution of orbital eccentricities for our stars does not resemble that of the direct accretion scenario , instead resembling a population that was formed _ in situ_.    using the full rave catalog of stars , @xcite also computed orbital eccentricities for a more uniform sample of thick disk stars , finding results consistent with ours . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite looked at the orbital eccentricities of a sample of thick - disk candidate stars selected from the sloan digital sky survey , and found that their distribution is inconsistent with the thick disk forming from radial migration only or heating due to mergers only .",
    "@xcite , however , show that their distribution , using data from rave and the southern proper motion program , is most consistent with the heating and merger scenarios .",
    "overall , these results still support our finding that the stars in the thick disk primarily formed _ in situ_. it is also important to note that our distribution of eccentricities is the first to have the metal - poor thick disk well - represented , but selection biases may be affecting the shape of the distribution .    from previous investigations of the local neighborhood and our more extended sample , it is clear that the thick disk is old , and had to form stars during a short , rapid burst to produce the @xmath4-enhancement we detect .",
    "direct accretion of stars from dwarf galaxies that formed a long time ago ( about @xmath187  gyr ago ) during a period of rapid star formation is then still viable .",
    "these types of dwarf galaxies , however , are extremely rare .",
    "all known dwarf spheroidal galaxies typically have extended star formation and lower @xmath4-enhancement at the same @xmath12 range of the metal - poor thick disk ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "we can therefore conclude with confidence that the _ late _ accretion of stars from satellite galaxies did not play a role in the formation of the thick disk .",
    "models that include a significant component of the thick disk formed _ in situ _",
    ", however , need to be further assessed .",
    "these models all imply or directly predict a thick disk with high @xmath4-enhancement .",
    "further , given the errors in the distances to our stars , and the effects of our definition of ` thick disk ' , the orbital eccentricity distribution of our sample of metal - poor thick disk stars does not show any direct inconsistencies with the distributions in s09 for these scenarios .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that the s09 @xmath134-distribution for the heating scenario shows a significant fraction of accreted stars that comprise the thick disk . unless all of these accreted stars were assimilated into the thick disk at early times ( as stated above ) , then this fraction of stars would have lower @xmath4-enhancement than we see in our sample .",
    "the models also show differences in their predictions for radial or vertical abundance variation .",
    "observational evidence for abundance gradients in the thick disk are therefore very important .",
    "the majority of previous studies with high resolution analyses have shown no evidence for a vertical metallicity gradient in the thick disk ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies , however , primarily include nearby stars with @xmath188 , while our gradient is computed for thick - disk stars with @xmath2 .",
    "more recent studies have shown evidence for the possibility of a vertical metallicity gradient .",
    "looking at stars at high galactic latitudes and @xmath189  kpc , @xcite found that iron abundance decreases with vertical height by @xmath190 .",
    "this data , however , may have strong contamination from the thin disk .",
    "@xcite found a @xmath191 metallicity gradient for stars selected from sdss that lie a vertical heights , @xmath192  kpc . at these heights , the likelihood of contamination from thin disk is small , and so one could deduce that they were looking at mostly thick disk stars .    the stars in our sample assigned to the thick disk lie within about @xmath193  kpc radially about the sun , and have vertical distances of @xmath194  kpc . due to biases introduced by our analysis technique , we only investigated abundance gradients for those stars with @xmath195 .",
    "we found very small amplitude radial and vertical gradients , @xmath3 , in the @xmath4-enhancement of the metal - poor thick disk .",
    "this further verifies that the ism was well mixed during star formation .",
    "further , we found a small @xmath196 radial iron abundance gradient , however , it is possible that @xmath12 significantly changes by @xmath197 with vertical height above the galactic plane .",
    "a fit resulting in no gradient is still possible , however , within 2-sigma confidence limits .",
    "note that it is possible that including the more metal - rich thick disk would significantly change the amplitude of the slope of the gradients .",
    "our results , however , resemble those found by groups studying the more metal - rich thick disk ( as given above ) .",
    "a vertical metallicity gradient is expected from the dissipational collapse model .",
    "additionally , a thick disk with uniformly enhanced @xmath4-abundances is also likely if the collapse took several millions of years , as predicted @xcite .",
    "rapid star formation early on during the heating scenario will produce enhanced @xmath0 ratios , while small amplitude radial abundance gradients are also possible .",
    "the merger model also predicts a high star formation rate from gas dissipation , and hence enhanced @xmath0 ratios , but the final thick disk is expected to have uniform abundance ratios .",
    "although our data does not directly disagree with a uniform disk , a significant iron abundance gradient would challenge this scenario .",
    "it is also important to note that there is direct accretion of stars during the merger and heating scenarios , which can occur until late times .",
    "late accretion of stars must therefore be extremely minimal for the abundances of the final thick disks in these scenarios to match the low scatter in @xmath0 for our thick disk stars .",
    "an @xmath4-enhanced thick disk is also implied from the clumpy disk model in which there is rapid star formation from internal processes with rapid mixing by strong turbulence .",
    "additionally , the thick disk in the radial migration model has high @xmath0 ratios , since the stars in the inner disk undergo rapid star formation and then move outward , ( see * ? ? ?",
    "no radial abundance gradients are predicted due to blurring across radii in the radial migration model and the turbulent mixing in the clumpy disk model .",
    "note that the radial migration model does not include effects from the bar of the galaxy .",
    "it is possible that the combination of the bar and spiral arms could result in a very efficient mixing mechanism , which could cause variation in the metallicity of the thick disk as a function of radius @xcite .",
    "it is unclear , however , if a vertical iron abundance gradient is possible in either the radial migration model or clumpy disk model , indicating that more modeling must be done to ascertain this chemical signature .",
    "the metal - poor thick disk of the milky way galaxy is enhanced in the @xmath4-elements and reaches to metallicities down to -2  dex .",
    "we find that the stars in the thick disk most likely formed within the potential well of the milky way galaxy .",
    "direct accretion of stars could have occurred at very early times ( @xmath198  gyr after the start of star formation ) in the formation of the thick disk , but the later contribution of accreted stars into the thick disk was very minimal .",
    "the abundance trends of the metal - poor thick disk tends to favor models which result in a thick disk with a significant vertical metallicity gradient , however , a uniformly enhanced thick disk is still possible .",
    "additionally , the radial migration and internal star formation at high redshift may have also contributed to the formation of the thick disk , but more work needs to be done to quantify the abundance trends for these scenarios .",
