    "until recently the problems of a relativistic detonation when a velocities both of wave and gas ( plasma ) achieve of near - light velocities had only methodical interest . in connection with the hypothesis of a detonation regime of  burning  of the cosmic scalar fields  @xcite",
    "this problem takes on physical interest . as well as in ref .",
    "@xcite we suppose that there is a scalaron star in which the pressure of the field is equilibrated by the weak gravitational forces ( newtonian approximation ) .",
    "then it is possible to describe the specified process of detonation in framework of special relativity .",
    "other field of application can be , in principle , the processes of laboratory scale  @xcite .    at description of this phenomenon at the front of  detonation  wave according to conservation laws both of relativistic momenta density and momenta density flow @xmath1(field ) = @xmath1(plasma ) and @xmath2(field ) = @xmath3(plasma ) for the scalar field in the rest , on which the wavefront with velocity @xmath4  is passing , we have : @xmath5 here , @xmath6 is the energy density of the scalar field in scalaron regime ( it forms from density both of potential and kinetic energy of the field ) , @xmath7  is the energy density of plasma behind the wavefront .",
    "thus the plasma removes from the wavefront with the velocity of sound @xmath8  that corresponds to a condition of normal detonation . as well as in ref .",
    "@xcite we choose the scalar field of the simplest form @xmath9 which has rather small spatial derivatives . in eqn .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) @xmath10  is a velocity of high - temperature plasma relative to the wavefront @xmath4 .",
    "in this report we are interesting in dynamics of the detonation wave and the current behind one in the case when @xmath11  depends on radial coordinate @xmath12 . for considering of this problem",
    "it is expediently to repeat briefly the results of the homogeneous case .",
    "the set of equations of relativistic gas - dynamics in special relativity for spherical frame with use of usual radial velocity @xmath13  is possible to write as : @xmath14 + \\frac{1}{\\theta ^{2}}\\left ( \\frac{% \\partial v}{\\partial r}+v\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial \\tau } \\right ) + \\frac{2v}{% r } & = & 0 , \\\\",
    "\\frac{\\partial \\sigma } { \\partial \\tau } + v\\frac{\\partial \\sigma } { \\partial r}% + \\sigma \\left [ \\frac{1}{\\theta ^{2}}\\left ( \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial r}+v% \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial \\tau } \\right ) + \\frac{2v}{r}\\right ]   & = & 0 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath15 is the entropy density , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . according to the classical theory of a spherical detonation considered by zeldovich  @xcite ,",
    "the pattern of current is self - similar and depending from the unique variable @xmath19 for the relativistic problem we maintain the same self - similarity .",
    "the mentioned above velocity @xmath10  relative to the wavefront should be equal to the velocity of sound of relativistic plasma @xmath20 .",
    "thus the velocity of the detonation wave @xmath21  according to eqn .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the set of eqns .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) supposes the deriving of one equation relative to velocity @xmath13 : @xmath22 = \\frac{2v}{\\xi } \\frac{\\theta ^{2}}{1-v\\xi } .\\ ] ] the analysis of this equation is carried out similarly to ref .",
    "@xcite and the diagrams of solutions both for @xmath13and energy density of plasma @xmath7  are shown in fig . 1 .    ( 500,270 ) ( -30,-140 )    at the wavefront the derivative of the velocity tends to infinity .",
    "at @xmath23  the solution @xmath24  is matched with @xmath25with maintenance of a continuity of first derivative .",
    "this point corresponds to a contact discontinuity .",
    "thus the solution for @xmath26  is obtained from the second equation of system ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to show that for photon gas with @xmath27  and entropy density @xmath28  @xcite the third equation from ( [ eq3 ] ) is satisfy identically .",
    "it is necessary to note that the nonrelativistic analog of this problem , considered for the first time by zeldovich , corresponds to isentropic flow of classical gas - dynamics .",
    "as it was specified above , it is not valid for a relativistic problem where the flow is adiabatic . in paper",
    "@xcite the statement about isentropy in the relativistic problem is incorrect , though all obtained results are valid by virtue of the mentioned above note about identical realization of the equation for the entropy from ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "as the scalar field @xmath6 which is  burnt  in the detonation wave represents a gravitational cluster ( scalaron  star  ) , its energy depends on coordinate @xmath12 . in the example of solution considered in ref .",
    "@xcite for such cluster @xmath29  except for central area . in this connection",
    "it is interesting to find a self - similar solution for the relativistic detonation at @xmath30 .",
    "note that the velocity of the detonation wave according to eqn .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) does not depend on energies density @xmath31  and remains constant . on this reason",
    "the mentioned above dependence is possible to present as : @xmath32 where @xmath33  is still determined by expression ( [ eq4 ] ) and @xmath34  is a representative of the function @xmath6 . in this case also is possible to obtain one equation on @xmath35which is possible to write as @xmath36 = \\frac{2v}{\\xi } \\frac{\\theta ^{2}}{1-v\\xi } -\\frac{% n\\theta ^{4}}{(1+\\omega ^{2})(1-v\\xi ) ^{2}}.\\ ] ]    = -2 ( the equation for the entropy is still satisfy identically . ) at @xmath37  the last equation passes in eqn .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "the key difference of this equation from eqn .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) is the absence of solution @xmath25  that changes qualitatively the form of solution shown in fig . 1 .",
    "on the other hand the small values of @xmath38  can not in essence change the form of the solution near to front .",
    "it is necessary to expect that there is a critical value @xmath39since which this region of solution will be essential change also .",
    "it can be found from the following reasons : infinite derivative @xmath40  at the wavefront , as well as in eqn .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , is achieved at tendency of the factor in brackets on the _ l.h.s . _ in eqn .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) to zero from above and positive determinancy of expression on the _ r.h.s .",
    "_ at realization of these requirements the flow behind the front will coincide qualitatively with the case considered already  @xcite .",
    "the differences are appeared that on the side of small values of @xmath13  in central region the solution @xmath24will grow linearly from centre and the complete solution is obtained by matching of the specified two solutions .",
    "thus the value of velocity remains continuous and the jump is experienced only by derivatives ( fig .",
    "note that the point of matching is not casual .",
    "according to the qualitative theory of the differential equations it corresponds to a singular point - node .",
    "the branches of solutions @xmath24going out from the point @xmath41  and from the wavefront at @xmath42  and @xmath43  with inevitability fall into this point . note that the centre ( @xmath44 ) is a singular point - saddle and the solution @xmath45 in a neighbourhood of centre which is interesting for us is a separatrix going from a saddle to a node that is according to the qualitative theory of the differential equations .",
    "in accordance with increasing of @xmath38  the coordinate of this node on the axis @xmath33  is monotonically moved from the minimum value @xmath46  up to @xmath42  at @xmath47 .",
    "it is a limiting value of inhomogeneity of the energy density of the scalar field at which the solution @xmath24  remains continuous from centre up to the wavefront . since @xmath48  the condition of  over - compressed  detonation is realized  @xcite when the velocity of the detonation wave becomes larger then the specified value @xmath4  from eqn .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) . behind the wavefront the supersonic current takes place which terminates in a relativistic shock wave ( sw ) . behind the sw",
    "the solution is matched with continuous current of @xmath24  going up to centre .",
    "the coordinate of the sw and the parameters of plasma are determined from conservation laws on the sw  @xcite . this variant is interesting because of the velocities both of the front @xmath4  and plasma behind it can achieve ultra relativistic values ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the case when the exponent @xmath50 has the special interest .",
    "last means that the energy density of the scalar field grows from centre to periphery .",
    "( note that for field stars , when the effective negative pressure is realized , such variants are possible . )",
    "the analysis of the eqn .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) shows that as against considered before cases the velocity of the plasma in a neighbourhood of centre becomes negative ( the motion to centre ) .",
    "it easy to understand qualitatively , as the increasing density of the field energy enters the wavefront .",
    "the adiabatic compression of gas in central region brings to increase of the energy density at centre ( fig .",
    "it is important to note that for laboratory problems the similar control of the energy density by laser radiation can brings to increase of temperature at centre",
