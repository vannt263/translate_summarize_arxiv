    "two recent groundbreaking studies have opened up the class of the pulsators for asteroseismic investigations . for the star v836 cen , aerts et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2004a ) acquired and analysed 21 years of time - resolved geneva photometry .",
    "they identified the six detected pulsation modes with their pulsational quantum numbers ( the radial fundamental mode , an @xmath2 triplet and two components of a rotationally split @xmath3 mode ) .",
    "consequent seismic modelling ( dupret et al . 2004 ) allowed the derivation of constraints on the star s position in the hr diagram and its convective core size plus demonstrated that its interior rotation is not rigid .",
    "a second star , @xmath4eri , was studied with large photometric and spectroscopic multisite campaigns ( handler et al .",
    "2004 , aerts et al .",
    "2004b ) , yielding a total of almost 1200 hours of measurement .",
    "the nine modes detected for this star were identified with the radial fundamental mode , two @xmath2 triplets , one @xmath2 singlet and one @xmath3 mode ( de ridder et al .",
    "seismic modelling ( pamyatnykh , handler & dziembowski 2004 , ausseloos et al .",
    "2004 ) demonstrated that the pulsation spectrum of @xmath4eri can not be reproduced with standard models , some convective core overshooting may be required and again non - rigid interior rotation must be present ( with the edge of the convective core rotating about 3 times faster than the outer layers , consistent with the findings for v836 cen ) .",
    "the seismic results indicate that it is possible that the interior chemical composition of the star is not homogeneous .",
    "after some 15 years of frustration , asteroseismology of opacity - driven main sequence pulsators has thus finally become reality .",
    "the reasons why some stars are the first such objects to be studied may be summarised as follows : their pulsational mode spectra are sufficiently simple that few possibilities for erroneous or ambiguous mode identifications occur , yet the observed spectra are fairly complete ; radial modes have been detected for the two abovementioned stars ( substantially reducing the number of possible seismic models ) ; finally , the applied mode identification methods do work ( e.g. see handler et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the general astrophysical implications of seismic studies of the stars are also highly interesting",
    ". since these objects are main sequence stars between 9 and 17 @xmath5 ( stankov & handler 2005 ) , they are progenitors of type ii supernovae , which in turn are largely responsible for the enrichment of the interstellar medium and thus for the chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "consequently , if we can trace the evolution of stars by sounding their interiors in different evolutionary states , we are not only able to calibrate stellar structure and evolution calculations , but could put constraints on the modelling of extragalactic stellar systems .",
    "therefore it is highly desirable to determine the interior structure of several stars .",
    "one of the objects that seems well suited for an asteroseismic study is .",
    "the variability of this bright ( @xmath6  mag ) object has been known for a long time ( henroteau 1922 ) , and the corresponding period determinations in the literature are partly controversial . several authors ( van hoof & blaauw 1958 , van hoof 1962 , briers 1971 , heynderickx 1992 ) noted variable shapes of their radial velocity and light curves , indicating multiperiodicity .",
    "however , no consensus on the values of possible secondary and tertiary periods was reached .    together with the presence of archival high - resolution spectroscopy ( to be analysed in a companion paper by briquet et al .",
    "2005 ) , the findings mentioned above made  an attractive target for a multisite study .",
    "consequently , we have carried out a photometric campaign on this star in mid 2003 .",
    "we acquired single - channel differential photoelectric photometry through the strmgren @xmath1 filters with three telescopes on three continents during the months of april to august 2003 .",
    "the measurements of  were obtained with respect to two comparison stars , 44 oph ( hd 157792 , a3 m , @xmath7 ) and 51 oph ( hd 158643 , a0v , @xmath8 ) .",
    "owing to the brightness of all three objects , some neutral density filters were applied to avoid damage of the photomultipliers .",
    "a short summary of the observations is given in table 1 .",
    "the total time base of our measurements is 124 days .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     our mode identifications are not very satisfactory at this point , but fortunately we can use other clues to constrain them further .",
    "firstly , since @xmath9 is clearly a radial mode , we can rule out that @xmath10 is also radial because the frequency ratio of these two modes ( @xmath11 ) is considerably larger than any period ratio of low - order radial modes in a star can be .    secondly , heynderickx , waelkens & smeyers ( 1994 ) have identified @xmath12 as an @xmath3 mode from their walraven photometry .",
    "we have checked this identification with our method ( again taking the contribution of  to the total light into account ) and also find @xmath3 to be clearly the best match between observed and theoretical colour amplitude ratios .",
    "thirdly , daszyska - daszkiewicz et al .",
    "( 2002 ) demonstrated that modes of odd @xmath13 , starting with @xmath14 , suffer heavy geometric cancellation in photometric observations of stars using filters .",
    "for instance , an @xmath14 mode of the same intrinsic amplitude as an @xmath3 mode will have only @xmath15 of its photometric amplitude in the @xmath16 filters .",
    "we therefore disregard all the possible @xmath14 identifications in table 4 as well .",
    "thus we have arrived at unique @xmath13 identifications for five of the seven modes we detected : @xmath12 is @xmath3 , @xmath9 is radial , and @xmath17 are all @xmath2 . @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be either @xmath2 or 2 . as the last step , we examine the frequency spectrum of  ( schematically plotted in fig.6 ) for the presence of structures that may be useful for further constraining the mode identifications .        indeed , some interesting features can be discerned .",
    "the @xmath2 modes @xmath20 and @xmath10 form a frequency triplet that is almost equally spaced .",
    "however , there is a slight asymmetry , and it is exactly in the sense expected for nonradial @xmath21-mode splitting due to the second - order effects of rotation .",
    "we therefore believe that @xmath20 and @xmath10 are indeed a rotationally split triplet of @xmath2 modes .",
    "the remaining four modes are also grouped together .",
    "intriguingly , the spacing between @xmath18 and @xmath19 is approximately half the frequency difference of @xmath19 and the @xmath3 mode @xmath12 .",
    "again , the asymmetry of this hypothesised @xmath22 multiplet is consistent with the second - order effects of rotation .",
    "@xmath9 does not fit this pattern , but this is not surprising as we have already identified it as a radial mode .",
    "the first - order rotational splitting obtained from the @xmath22 multiplet is very similar to the splitting of the @xmath20 and @xmath10 triplet .",
    "thus we suspect that @xmath23 and @xmath18 are part of a rotationally split @xmath3 quintuplet with two components yet undetected .    assuming that the mean splitting of the @xmath2 triplet is a good approximation of the surface rotation frequency of  ( i.e. neglecting effects of the coriolis force and possible differential internal rotation ) , we derive a rotation period of 9.6 days .",
    "the absolute magnitude and effective temperature of the star , as determined at the beginning of this section , result in a radius of @xmath24  r@xmath25 , and hence in a surface rotation velocity of @xmath26 km / s . as the measured projected rotational velocity of  is about 30 km / s ( e.g. abt , levato & grosso 2002 ) , there is a chance that we see the star close to equator - on .",
    "if we indeed saw  equator - on , it can be suspected that the spectroscopic companion discovered by briquet et al .",
    "( 2005 ) may cause eclipses .",
    "the binary orbit derived by these authors leads to an ephemeris for the times of primary and secondary minimum , respectively .",
    "m. briquet ( private communication ) predicts @xmath27 @xmath28 where i is the number of orbital revolutions since epoch zero .",
    "given the total mass of the spectroscopic binary system ( @xmath29m@xmath25 ) , the orbital period and the radius of the primary determined above , we can also estimate the maximum duration of a possible eclipse , amounting to @xmath30h .",
    "although we found no obvious evidence for eclipses in our photometric measurements , we folded our data according to this ephemeris and searched them again for possible eclipses .",
    "as it turns out , we have no measurements whatsoever during or even near the predicted times of primary minimum , which is not surprising given that our orbital coverage is only @xmath31 17 per cent .",
    "we do have data around the expected times of secondary eclipse , but none is found , which is also not a surprise since the secondary of the spectroscopic binary would much less luminous than  if we see the orbital plane ( close to ) edge - on , and consequently the depth of a secondary eclipse would be too small to be detected .",
    "we again conclude that there are no eclipses in our photometry of the  system .",
    "our photometric multisite campaign on the star  resulted in the detection of seven independent pulsation modes .",
    "our colour photometry that was intended for mode typing only resulted in two firm identifications , but we believe that this is mostly due to the small photometric amplitudes of all but one of the pulsation modes .",
    "however , also the strongest mode could not be unambiguously identified from our data ; we had to invoke literature results .",
    "mode identification from colour photometry of stars primarily rests on the amplitudes determined in the blue and ultraviolet ( @xmath32   ) .",
    "we have used a subset of the strmgren filter system for our measurements as a compromise between wide availability and mode identification potential , with the drawback that the identifications critically depend on the results in the @xmath33 filter , which may be hard to verify .",
    "consequently , any systematic error in the @xmath33 measurements can heavily compromise the mode identifications .",
    "the walraven or the geneva photometric systems would provide a solution to this dilemma , but they are unsuitable for multisite work since few observatories are equipped for their use .",
    "however , the pulsation spectrum of  is reasonably simple and the range of excited frequencies is less than 1 , so that an extensive single - site study of this star in one of these photometric systems should be sufficient to check the mode identifications we finally arrived at by adding further constraints to the colour amplitude analysis .",
    "we believe that our suggestion that @xmath23 and @xmath18 are part of a rotationally split @xmath3 quintuplet can also be checked by theoretical model calculations .",
    "since the asymmetry of the hypothesised multiplet due to the second - order effects of rotation has been measured to good relative accuracy , and since the rotation rate of the star is constrained by the @xmath34 triplet splitting , pulsational models should be able to reproduce the observed asymmetries if our identification of @xmath23 and @xmath18 is correct .    to perform a detailed asteroseismic study , one more ambiguity",
    "must then still be overcome : if @xmath23 and @xmath18 are @xmath3 quintuplet members , their @xmath21 values must be determined . from photometry alone , we can not distinguish if they correspond to @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "however , the analysis of archival spectroscopy by briquet et al .",
    "( 2005 ) solves this ambiguity .",
    "it is interesting to note that we found evidence that  is seen close to equator on ( a result corroborated by briquet et al .",
    "in such a configuration , the @xmath37 component of @xmath2 modes as well as the @xmath38 components of @xmath3 modes should suffer heavy geometric cancellation . however , such modes are apparently observed .    in any case , a seismic investigation of  is possible .",
    "we note that we would not expect its outcome to be as fruitful as that for @xmath4  eri ( pamyatnykh et al .",
    "2004 , ausseloos et al . 2004 ) since fewer radial overtones of modes are excited , but the general applicability of earlier results could be tested .",
    "in addition , the detection of a possible eclipse of the primary would help to constrain the system parameters even tighter , which can in turn assist the seismic modelling .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that the frequency structure of  is remarkably similar to that of v836 cen ( aerts et al .",
    "2004a ) : a radial mode close to an incomplete @xmath3 multiplet of somewhat lower frequency and a complete @xmath2 triplet of higher frequency , and all modes are contained in a very narrow frequency interval ( which is of extremely similar size in the co - rotating frame ) .",
    "the only differences are the somewhat higher pulsation frequencies of  and its faster rotation .",
    "we thus speculate that once more pulsation spectra of stars become known in detail , important clues on mode excitation can be gathered .",
    "this work has been supported by the austrian fonds zur frderung der wissenschaftlichen forschung under grant r12-n02 .",
