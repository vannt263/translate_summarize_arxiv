    "one of the main purposes of the lhc collider is to search for the physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "one of the direction of this search is a possible discovery of superpartners of ordinary particles as expected in supersymmetric extensions of sm ( susy ) .",
    "susy , if it exists , is expected to reveal itself at lhc via excess of ( multilepton + ) multijet + e@xmath0 final states compared to standard model ( sm ) expectations @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this study is to evaluate the potential of the cms detector @xcite to find evidence for susy .",
    "it deals , first with the squarks and gluino mass reach , as the production cross - section of these strongly interacting sparticles ( pair production or in association with charginos and neutralinos ) dominates the total susy cross - section over a wide region of the parameter space . in our previous study concerning",
    "maximal reach in msugra for low tan@xmath4 @xcite the sm background was somewhat underestimated ; furthermore the signal form squarks and gluinos was taken into account , without associated production of squarks and gluino with electroweak sparticles . besides the lepton isolation requirements at the tracker level were somewhat unrealistic ( too small cone size r@xmath13=0.1 ) allowing electrons to be `` isolated '' in jets .",
    "here we make a substantial revision of the results previously obtained and extend our search to the domain of large values of tan@xmath4 .",
    "the effect of event pile - up on the possible msugra reach is also investigated .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we discuss the specific susy model employed in section 2 . in section 3",
    "the simulation procedure issues are presented .",
    "comparison of same signal and background distributions is shown in section 4 .",
    "section 5 describes the cuts optimization procedure allowing to adjust the cuts proposed to the condition in various domains of the model parameter space .",
    "the main results of our study are presented in section 6 where we also discuss the stability of the reach contours versus various sources of uncertainty .",
    "the conclusions are given in section 7 .",
    "the large number of susy parameters even in the framework of minimal extension of the sm ( mssm ) makes it difficult to evaluate the general reach .",
    "so , for this study we restrict ourselves at present to the msugra - mssm model .",
    "this model evolves from mssm , using grand unification theory ( gut ) assumptions ( see more details in e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , it is a representative model , especially in case of inclusive studies and reach limits expressed in terms of squark and gluino mass which do not depend critically on the specific choice of branchings and mass values as will be indirectly shown by the results of this work .",
    "the msugra model contains only five free parameters @xmath3    * a common gaugino mass ( @xmath14 ) ; * a common scalar mass ( @xmath15 ) ; * a common trilinear interaction amongst the scalars ( @xmath16 ) ; * the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the higgs fields that couple to @xmath17 and @xmath18 fermions ( tan@xmath4 ) ; * a higgsino mixing parameter @xmath5 which enters only through its sign ( @xmath19 ) .    for a given choice of model parameters all the masses and couplings , thus production cross sections and branching ratios are fixed . at a later stage",
    "it can be generalized to the mssm in which no such constraining relations exist .",
    "the mass of the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) which is @xmath20 in the r - parity conserving msugra equals approximately @xmath21 0.5 of @xmath22 .",
    "the mass of lightest chargino @xmath23 is almost the same as that of @xmath22 .",
    "isomass contours of @xmath24 and @xmath23 and gluino behave gaugino - like , i.e. depend mainly on @xmath14 .",
    "masses of sleptons and squarks depend on both @xmath15 and @xmath14 .",
    "masses of squarks ( especially of the first generation ) , gluino , charginos and neutralinos depend only weakly on tan@xmath4 , a@xmath1 or sign(@xmath5 ) parameters",
    ". masses of sleptons , stop and sbottom have some dependence on these msugra parameters , whilst masses of higgs bosons depend significantly on tan@xmath4 ( see some examples e.g. in @xcite ) , the mass of lightest scalar higgs increases with tan@xmath4 and depends also on sign(@xmath5 ) , whilst masses of the heavy higgses decreases dramatically with tan@xmath4 .",
    "since masses , branchings , cross - sections vary most rapidly with m@xmath25 , m@xmath2 , it is natural to follow the commonly used way of presenting msugra data as a function of these two parameters for different fixed values of tan@xmath4 and sign@xmath26 ) .",
    "the a@xmath25 parameter is usually set to zero , since its variation has small effect on the results .",
    "figs.1,2 show isomass contours of susy particles for some particular choice of msugra parameters , namely @xmath3 tan@xmath4 = 2 , a@xmath1 = 0 and @xmath5 @xmath27 0 just to have some idea about the characteristic values and behaviour of the masses versus m@xmath25 and m@xmath2 .",
    "the shaded regions along the axes denotes theoretically ( th ) and up to now experimentally ( ex ) excluded regions of the model parameter space .",
    "the data concerning these regions were taken from @xcite .",
    "the mssm establishes the relation between the top mass and tan@xmath4 ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath3    m@xmath28 = 4@xmath29y@xmath30 @xmath31 ( 1 )    here y@xmath32 is top yukava coupling . for low tan@xmath4 the top yukava coupling",
    "can be derived from known gauge couplings alone , which leads to the tan@xmath4 value of 1.6@xmath60.3 for m@xmath32 = 175@xmath66 gev .",
    "taking into account behaviour of bottom and @xmath33 yukava couplings at large tan@xmath4 ( see discussion e.g. in @xcite ) , it seems to be possible to find second solution of eq.(1 ) with tan@xmath4 @xmath34 33@xmath63 ( see also fig.6 in @xcite ) .",
    "so , from now on we will consider mainly dependence of various msugra observables and will present our results for 4 sets of tan@xmath4 and @xmath5 parameters , keeping a@xmath25=0 , see table.1 .",
    "hbtp &   & +    &  &    .sets of msugra parameter values investigated .",

    "figs.18 - 21 show the main results of our study for msugra parameter sets given in tab.1 assuming an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath9 . fig.22",
    "regroups figs.18 - 21 together , without details , just for visual comparison of respective searches .",
    "the dashed - dotted lines in figs.18 - 21 are isomass contours for squarks ( @xmath35 ) , gluino ( @xmath36 ) and lightest scalar higgs ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "numbers in parenthesis denote mass values of corresponding isomass contour .",
    "the neutralino relic density contours from ref .",
    "@xcite , for msugra domain m@xmath1@xmath271000 gev , m@xmath2@xmath271000 gev , are also shown in figs.18 - 21 for @xmath38 = 0.15 , 0.4 and 1.0 .",
    "value @xmath38@xmath391 would lead to a universe age less than 10 billion years old , in contradiction with estimated age of the oldest stars .",
    "the region in between 0.15 and 0.4 is favoured by the mixed dark matter ( mdm ) cosmological models .",
    "it is a rather general situation that for all investigated sets of msugra parameters the best reach can be obtained with the e@xmath0 signature .",
    "the more leptons required - the smaller reach , as can be seen from figs.18 - 22 . for",
    "set 1 one can see that the entire m@xmath1 , m@xmath2 plane ( fig.18 ) is covered , in principle by lep ii through higgs searches .",
    "this is not the case for set 2 ( fig.19 ) .",
    "anyway , for low tan@xmath4 cosmologically interesting regions will be definitely covered by lep ii or lhc reach .",
    "i does not seem so evident for high values of tan@xmath4 ( figs.20 and 21 ) , where the calculations of @xmath38=1 contours available are limited to m@xmath2 @xmath40 1000 gev .",
    "but again , the cosmologically preferred region @xmath38@xmath270.4 seems to be entirely within the reach of cms . in both figs.20 and 21",
    "we also show our calculations for the e@xmath0 signature reach for an integrated luminosity of 300 fb@xmath9 , trying to estimate the ultimate cms reach .",
    "the higgs contours in figs.20 and 21 show that most of the m@xmath1 , m@xmath2 planes is out of reach for lep ii .",
    "it is worth noticing that the cumulative reach of several signatures , like 0l + 1l + 2l + 3l + ... ( in descending order of contribution ) can be even better than the most promising single e@xmath0 signature .",
    "we show this with the cumulative 0l + 1l + 2l os signatures curve ( main leptonic signatures ) in fig.21 . despite the fact that this curve does is not obtained with the optimally adjusted cuts ( each signature was optimized separately to have the best significance and then signal and background values were summed up for all three signatures )",
    ", one can see that the reach obtained is better than that of the e@xmath0 signature .    here",
    "we do not consider the limitations on the msugra parameter space imposed by the @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 calculations @xcite based on the data from cleo @xcite .",
    "these calculations exclude at 95 % cl the part of m@xmath1 , m@xmath2 plane approximately below squark isomass contour of 1600 gev for set 3 and below a similar contour of @xmath34 600 gev for set 4 respectively . for low tan@xmath4 ( sets 1 and 2 )",
    "the msugra parameter space domain excluded this way is rather small @xcite .      in our study",
    "we always require that the isolation criterion mentioned in section 3 be fulfilled by electrons , so as to be identified in the cms detector . on the contrary",
    "the muon isolation requirement is a parameter in the cuts optimization procedure described in section 5 .",
    "this is so as a muon can be identified even when it is embedded in a jet .",
    "fig.23 illustrates the effect of the muon isolation requirement on the reach contours for various multilepton signatures for msugra parameter set 4 with 100 fb@xmath9 .",
    "one can see that for low values of m@xmath1 it is profitable to apply muon isolation ( dashed line ) , whilst for high m@xmath1 values some small gain can be obtained by not applying the muon isolation criterion ( solid line ) .",
    "this is due to some difference in the origin of leptons in these two domains of m@xmath1 . as it was discussed in section 2 ( can also be seen in figs.7 and 8) , the sources of isolated leptons in the low - m@xmath1 region of set 4 are mainly @xmath33 and w abundantly produced in the cascade decays of squarks and gluinos . in the high - m@xmath1 region of set 4",
    "the situation changes slightly @xmath3 w - bosons are still present in cascades of strongly interacting sparticles , but increasing average number of b - jets ( e.g. @xmath22 almost completely decay into @xmath44 , and higgs in turn has branching into @xmath45 of @xmath34 80 - 90 % ) contributes significantly to the increase of non - isolated muon production .",
    "as can be seen from the numerical examples shown in tab.5 , in the vicinity of 5 @xmath7 reach boundary the s / b ratio is generally @xmath39 1 .",
    "so one can expect that the stability of the 5 @xmath7 reach in terms of s / @xmath46 depends largely on the variations of the signal rather than on the background .",
    "we are aware however that pythia can underestimate the w / z + jets cross section , especially for multijet events .",
    "fig.24 shows the band of the 5 @xmath7 reach for e@xmath10 and 2l ss signatures for set 4 induced by varying the msugra signal cross section within @xmath6 30 % around the nominal value given by isajet . in fig.25",
    "one can see the uncertainty band similar to that in fig.24 , but now the sm background cross section is varied by a factor of 2 .",
    "the width of the band for the 2l ss signature in fig.25 is rather small and is of the order of pure statistical uncertainties .      adding event pile - up to the sm background at the generation stage causes a few times larger cpu consumption by the cmsjet package than without pile - up , since the number of fired cells ( crystals , towers ) to be processed increases significantly . besides",
    ", in the frame of the mentioned package , only a limited sample of pile - up events ( 10@xmath47 - 10@xmath48 bunch crossings ) can be used as an external input file due to the large scale ( hundreds of mb ) of pile - up hits file ( similar to that of cmsim one ) .",
    "the limited size of pile - up sample means inevitably some bias in the data .",
    "these are the two main reasons why the sm background files were produced without pile - up admixture .",
    "hbtp &   & +    &  &    it is evident that in heavy event pile - up conditions one can expect some changes in both kinematical distributions ( increase of the mean jet number , degradation of e@xmath10 resolution etc . ) and deterioration of the lepton isolation . to estimate the effect of pile - up on the signal and background distributions , we compare some of the main distributions with in the presence of pile - up and without it .",
    "pile - up is taken from pythia s msel=2 with the @xmath2725@xmath39 interactions per bunch crossing .",
    "fig.26 shows the effect of pile - up on distributions on the number of jets , the summed e@xmath49 flow through detector and the e@xmath10 at some representative point of parameter space .",
    "one can see a rather insignificant effect of pile - up on the distributions presented , except for the increase of the transverse energy by @xmath34 800 gev , this is just the quantitative characteristic of the pile - up itself , the same increase is expected for any kind of events .",
    "fig.27 shows effects of pile - up on the same distributions as in fig.26 , but for the qcd background with 400@xmath50800 gev .",
    "here we see again an increase in the transverse energy flow by similar value of @xmath34 800 gev .",
    "there is also a non - negligible increase in the average number of jets ( over e@xmath51 = 40 gev threshold ) in qcd events , what is not observed in fig.26 for the probed signal point .",
    "the reason is rather simple , the indirect evidence can be derived from fig.16 , where the hardest jet distributions for signal and background are compared .",
    "one can see that total background distribution even for hardest jet falls down very quickly .",
    "the increase of the average number of the jets passing the cut in the qcd case is due to an exponential fall - off of the `` softest '' jet ( originating mainly from initial and final state radiation ) distribution , which shifts slightly to the right due to pile - up and giving rise to a significant number of additional jets in the event .",
    "this is not the case for the chosen signal point with m@xmath52@xmath34m@xmath53@xmath341900 gev and having all the jets with significant e@xmath51 .",
    "another possible effect of the pile - up impact on the mass reach could be due to the deterioration of leptonic isolation .",
    "we estimated the average ( over p@xmath54 , @xmath55 etc . )",
    "loss of isolated leptons as 10 - 15 % per lepton due to pile - up .",
    "these losses are already ( at least in part ) taken into account by a `` detection efficiency '' factor of 0.9 mentioned in section 3 . to estimate the total ( cumulative effect ) of the pile - up on the previously calculated 5@xmath7 contours , we admixed pile - up to all m@xmath25 , m@xmath2 points of set 4 and re - evaluated the reach contours using the technique described in section 5 for the three final states @xmath3 e@xmath10 , 1l and 2l os .",
    "the results are shown in fig.28 .",
    "one can see some significant effects of pile - up only in case of 2l os final states for low values of m@xmath25 , where the initial isolation of leptons ( originating mainly from @xmath33 and w ) can be spoiled by pile - up .",
    "it is worth reminding that both cases of isolated or non - isolated muons are treated to evaluate the best observability of the signal and cuts optimization procedure eventually allows some recovery in case of a non - dramatic signal losses .",
    "the main conclusions of our study are the following @xmath3 within the sugra model investigated susy would be detectable through an excess of events over sm expectations up to masses m@xmath53 @xmath21 m@xmath52 @xmath21 2.5 tev with 100 fb@xmath9 .",
    "this means that the entire plausible domain of ew - susy parameter space for most probable values of tan@xmath4 can be probed .",
    "furthermore , the s / b ratios are @xmath39 1 everywhere in the reachable domain of parameter space ( with the appropriate cuts ) thus allowing a study of kinematics of @xmath35 , @xmath36 production and obtaining information on their masses . the cosmologically interesting region @xmath56 1 , and even more so the preferred region 0.15 @xmath40 @xmath56 0.4 , can be entirely probed .",
