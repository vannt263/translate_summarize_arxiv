    "* ) or to the contrary @xcite .",
    "recent theories @xcite argue that most of the observed wave phase shifts in sunspot regions occur in a thin sub - photospheric region of 1 mm depth , where magnetic field effects are putatively the largest .",
    "the implication is that the causative mechanisms behind observed wave phase shifts may have been misidentified , a conclusion echoed by @xcite who demonstrate that wave source suppression due to convective blocking in sunspots can also participate in the task of creating time shifts ( also see , * ? ? ?",

    "finally , we summarize and conclude in @xmath0[conclude.sec ] .",
    "similar to the forward models of the solar wave field developed in @xcite and @xcite , we start by linearizing and modifying the ideal mhd equations in the following manner : @xmath1",

    "the controller term @xmath16 ( see figure  [ zeta.dep]a ) is such that it is constant ( = 1 ) over most of the interior but decays rapidly with height above the photosphere .",
    "note that @xmath16 is also present in equation  ( [ induction ] ) - as the influence of the magnetic field on the fluid decreases ( eq .  [ [ mom ] ] ) , so must the effect of the fluid on the magnetic field . for further discussion on the reasoning behind this term , see @xmath0[controller ] .",
    "we employ a cartesian coordinate system @xmath17 with @xmath18 denoting the unit vector along the vertical or @xmath19 axis and @xmath20 , time . because of the presence of a spatially varying magnetic structure , the background pressure , density , and sound speed adopt a full three - dimensional spatial dependence . in sequential order ,",
    "equations  ( [ cont ] ) through  ( [ energy ] ) enforce mass , momentum , and energy conservation respectively , while equation  ( [ induction ] ) is the induction equation .",
    "equation  ( [ delb ] ) assures us that magnetic monopoles do not exist . in interior regions of the computational box",
    "( away from the boundaries ) , solutions to the above equations are adiabatic since the damping terms decay to zero here .",
    "the source term @xmath15 , is a spatio - temporally varying function , the structure of which has been discussed in some detail in @xcite and @xcite . essentially , it is a phenomenological model for the multiple source wave excitation picture that is observed ( inferred perhaps ) in the sun .",
    "the background vertical stratification is an empirically derived @xcite , convectively stabilized form of model s @xcite .",
    "the base hydrodynamic method remains unchanged from @xcite ; spatial derivatives are calculated using sixth - order compact finite differences @xcite and time evolution is achieved through the repeated application of an optimized second - order five - stage runge - kutta scheme @xcite . the temporal order of accuracy is dropped because the time step ( 2 seconds ) is much smaller than the period of the waves studied here .",
    "the boundaries are lined with damping sponges in order to absorb ( damp ) outgoing waves ( figure  [ gammafig ] ) .",
    "this is to prevent any scattered waves from re - entering the computational domain as would be the case with periodic boundaries .",
    "our attempt to extend the base scheme to compute the magnetic field terms in equations  ( [ mom ] ) and  ( [ induction ] ) was successful .",
    "all derivatives , including the magnetic field terms , are estimated using sixth - order compact finite differences , thus maintaining a high order of spatial accuracy .",
    "it was observed that the @xmath21 term was of a low magnitude , @xmath22 per pixel , and therefore harmless ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the presence of the damping term @xmath23 ensures that @xmath21 is forced to decay in the damping sponge layers .",
    "validation in one and two dimensions of the essential numerical method ( i.e. without the @xmath16 or @xmath24 terms ) is discussed in appendix  [ validation.sec ] .      as stated in @xmath0[comp.method.sec ] , @xmath16 retains the value 1 in the interior and decreases with height above the photosphere ( figure  [ zeta.dep]a ) .",
    "it attempts to achieve a two - fold purpose : ( i ) a reduction in the lorentz force with increasing altitude above the photosphere and ( ii ) prevent the onset of negative pressure effects .",
    "the mean hydrodynamic pressure and density in sun drop exponentially with height in the atmosphere that immediately overlays the photosphere . in calculations of mhs states (",
    "@xmath0 [ mhs.states.sec ] ) , it was nearly impossible to prevent complete pressure and density evacuation in the interiors of flux tubes of large magnitude field strengths ( 1500 gauss and more - sadly nowhere close to the umbral field strengths of up to 6100 g that have been observed in sunspots by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "moreover , the equilibrium horizontal pressure distribution takes on strange forms , with the pressure at the center of flux tube attaining larger values than the ambient , when the flux tube radius is forced to increase faster than the corresponding potential field configuration . in the sun ,",
    "the presence of magnetic field everywhere and the phenomenon of flux tube merging in the atmosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) help reduce large gradients in the magnetic field , thereby preventing complete evacuation in active regions and sunspots while not requiring the flux tubes to flare out too rapidly .",
    "we attempt to simulate this ( criterion i ) through the @xmath14 term .",
    "however , since the equilibrium structure of an active region is as yet unknown , it is not possible to determine how realistic a chosen functional form of @xmath16 is .    to determine the impact of @xmath14 on the wave field",
    ", we simulate the interaction of a wave packet with a relatively weak flux tube ( @xmath25 100 gauss at the photospheric level ) in a solar - like stratified medium .",
    "three simulations are performed , a quiet simulation ( ` q ' ) without any magnetic field and two ( ` c ' and ` d ' ) with different functional forms of @xmath16 , one form of @xmath16 decaying more rapidly with height than the other ( shown in panel a of figure  [ zeta.dep ] ) .",
    "the initial condition for all simulations was chosen to be a gabor wavelet shaped disturbance in @xmath26 localized at @xmath27 mm , at all @xmath28 . at approximately the instant when the wave packet reaches the center of the flux tube ( located at @xmath29 mm )",
    ", we display snapshots of @xmath30 and @xmath31 in panels c and d respectively , where the superscripts refer to the simulation index ( q , c , or d ) . in the presence of a linear scatterer",
    ", one may view the velocity field as being associated with an incident and scattered wave ; in this situation , @xmath32 is the incident wave velocity , while the scattered wave velocities are described by the differences @xmath33 .",
    "it is clear from panels c and d of figure  [ zeta.dep ] that the extent of scatter in the simulation where @xmath16 decays higher up in the atmosphere ( c ) is greater by an order of magnitude than ( d ) .",
    "perhaps mode conversion , which has been theoretically shown to become significant when the plasma-@xmath34 starts to drop , is at play ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". it may also be that the magnetic field changes the @xmath26 eigenfunction more significantly in one case than the other .",
    "essentially , this experiment tells us that capturing wave interactions in an active regions is somewhat sensitively dependent on the choice of the @xmath16 function , or in other words , on the atmospheric magnetic field distribution in the vicinity .",
    "it underlines the neccessity of viewing this effort as more qualitative than quantitative , since conclusions of the latter sort require exploring a formidable parameter space .",
    "generating mhs states in stratified media can be a non - trivial task ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "fully consistent approaches that involve relaxing the mhd equations to low - energy equilibria are difficult to implement .",
    "moreover , such calculations are beyond the scope of this effort ; we are interested less in the mhs state itself than in the manner in which waves interact with them .",
    "we invoke the @xcite self - similar magnetic field geometry and ignore both radiative transfer effects and the satisfaction of the equation of state .",
    "we also remind the reader that the background stratification has been altered to prevent the onset of uncontrolled linear growth of convective instabilities , thus changing the opacities in a non - physical manner .",
    "the @xcite approximation tells us that making the following choices for the radial and vertical magnetic field @xmath35 and @xmath36 assures us of the satisfaction of equation  ( [ delb ] ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath37 @xmath38 with @xmath39 . the above equations  ( [ eq.bz ] ) and  ( [ eq.br ] ) are in cylindrical geometry ; @xmath40 , @xmath19 refer to the horizontal radial and vertical coordinates with @xmath41 coinciding to the center of the flux tube , @xmath42 a term that controls the magnitude of the magnetic field and hence the flux ( @xmath43 ) , and @xmath44 , the horizontal extent of the flux tube and the rate at which the flux tube spreads with altitude .",
    "the zeroth - order mhs equations in cylindrical coordinates , obtained upon dropping the time and azimuthal dependencies in equation  ( [ mom ] ) , reduce to : @xmath45 \\label{eq.pr},\\ ] ] along the horizontal ( @xmath40 ) direction and in the vertical ( @xmath19 ) direction , @xmath46 - \\rho g.\\label{eq.pz}\\ ] ] equation  ( [ eq.pr ] ) is integrated from @xmath47 to obtain the following equation : @xmath48,\\label{eqb.temp}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the pressure along the axis ( centerline ) of the flux tube and @xmath50 is the hydrostatic pressure far away from the magnetic region .",
    "the horizontal pressure distribution at a given @xmath19 can now be computed by integrating equation  ( [ eq.pr ] ) from the center outward : @xmath51\\label{eqb.pr};\\ ] ] thus the entire pressure field can be recovered through this procedure . simplifying equation  ( [ eq.pz ] )",
    ", we can obtain the density field from the pressure distribution : @xmath52\\right).\\label{eqb.den}\\ ] ] therefore , upon specifying parameters @xmath42 and @xmath44 in equations  ( [ eq.bz ] ) and  ( [ eq.br ] ) , one can obtain a self - consistent mhs solution that satisfies the criteria of @xmath53 and magneto - hydro - static balance",
    ". one must be careful however to ensure positive pressure and density in equations  ( [ eqb.pr ] ) and  ( [ eqb.den ] ) at all points in the computational domain . in figure  [ fluxtube.examp ]",
    ", we show an example of a flux tube which attains a peak strength of 600 g at the photospheric level ; the inclination of the field at distances away from the center is also shown .",
    "theoretical expectations dictate a decrease in modal power in magnetic regions due to mode absorption and mhd - wave coupling . using identical realizations of the source function @xmath15 ( eq .  [ [ mom ] ] )",
    ", we perform two simulations : a ` quiet ' run and an mhd counterpart ( ` mag ' ) with the flux tube of figure  [ fluxtube.examp ] embedded at the center of a computational box of size @xmath54 via the computational method of @xmath0[comp.method.sec ] . in figure  [ rms.changes ] , we show the difference in time - averaged root mean square ( rms ) wave power between a quiet simulation and its magnetic counterpart , normalized by the mean value of the rms of the quiet case . both runs were twelve hours long . because the realizations are identical , the mhd interactions are the dominant component of the quantity rms@xmath55 - rms@xmath56 .",
    "it is interesting to note that depending on the variable of study , the simulations predict strong variations in the nature and degree of change in wave power .",
    "for example , the rms differences in the total velocity , @xmath57 show the presence of a large reduction in wave power surrounded by an intense halo , whereas the rms decrease as seen in @xmath26 is systematically weaker and an almost invisible halo .",
    "the panels b and d show contours of increasing radii corresponding to field inclinations of @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "the halo is seen at inclinations of @xmath59 and higher , while a strong reduction in wave power is observed at smaller angles .",
    "also , the robustness of the halo was ensured by verifying its reappearance in a simulation using an alternate numerical method , namely a second - order constrained - transport technique ( ct ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to study these effects further , we computed power maps in four different frequency bandpasses , 2 - 3 , 3 - 4 , 4 - 5 , and 5 - 6 mhz .",
    "different components of the velocity were used in the calculations , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we subtract the power maps of the quiet simulation computed in the same bandpasses to reduce the realization noise .",
    "the frequency filters used to recover the power maps and the azimuthally averaged power profiles ( about the flux tube center ) obtained subsequently are shown in figure  [ azi_ave ] .",
    "noteworthy aspects are that @xmath62 contains the most intense halos , @xmath63 shows a dramatic increase in rms power in the range 4 - 5 mhz around the ` umbral ' region of the flux tube ( defined as within a distance of 8 mm from the center of the flux tube ) , while @xmath26 displays limited shifts in the rms in comparison to the rest . these effects ( or some fraction thereof )",
    "could be attributed to changes in the eigenfunctions caused by the magnetic fields .",
    "the appropriate identification of the nature of these increments and decrements is evidently an important issue .",
    "another set of power maps is displayed in figure  [ fat_tube ] .",
    "the upper set of panels contains the power maps of the 600 g flux tube whereas the lower two rows show the results from a simulation with a more realistically endowed sunspot : a 3000 g flux tube ( simulation size : @xmath64 ) .",
    "the flux tube configuration is very similar to that discussed in @xcite ; consequently , we do not show it here .",
    "the middle images are strikingly similar in structure to the observations of @xcite , who see power increasing progressively with frequency ( figure 1 of their paper ) .",
    "we see a large decrease in the rms power as felt by the pressure fluctuations ( interpreted crudely as intensity ) in the lowest set of panels .",
    "there is some qualitative agreement between the simulations and the intensity observations by @xcite ; however , the high resolution hinode measurements of intensity in active regions by @xcite are unfortunately not so easily woven into this computational web .",
    "intensity observations , as note @xcite , are far more difficult to interpret than those in velocity because of its sensitivity to the ionization , pressure , density etc . , and the lack of a one to one correspondence with a simple thermodynamic variable .    acoustic halos around the edges of active regions have been widely observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while @xcite have reported enhancements in oscillation velocity power also within magnetic regions and in low frequency ( @xmath65 mhz ) bandpasses ,",
    "a large number of other observations seem to show halos only in a high frequency bandpass and in predominantly weakly magnetic areas surrounding the active region @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that some qualitative features also seen in observations are reproduced in the simulations : ( 1 ) at the edge of the flux tube ( at @xmath66 mm in figure  [ azi_ave ] , @xmath67 g ) , only the highest frequency bandpass shows a faint power enhancement , of the order of 2 - 3 % in @xmath26 and even less in the other components , ( 2 ) the increase in wave power in the umbra of the flux tube in the 4 - 5 mhz bandpass ( panel d of figure  [ azi_ave ] ) is similar to enhancements seen in the magnetic cores of active regions @xcite , and ( 3 ) the enhancements grow with frequency , as seen in the simulation of the 3000 g flux tube of figure  [ fat_tube ] and in observations by @xcite . it would be rather ludicrous to make quantitative comparisons between observations and the simulations because of the simplified nature of these calculations : the lack of radiative heat transfer , realistic wave mode damping , a penumbra , convection , unmodeled atmospheric magnetic fields etc",
    ".    the speculation that enhanced seismic emission in the vicinity of active regions may be the causative mechanism of the acoustic halo goes back to the work of @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite have drawn similar conclusions from holography related analyses of active region observations . however",
    ", this theory does not explain the wave power increase in the simulations because in our calculations , wave source amplitudes are statistically homogeneously distributed in space ( in the horizontal directions ) with the exception of areas close to the boundaries .",
    "magnetic regions reconfigure the energy of the background medium .",
    "therefore , the presence of sources in the interior of the flux tube essentially complicates matters because the incipient waves may have energies unlike waves in quiet regions .",
    "moreover , the relative locations of the @xmath68 layer with respect to the acoustic reflection zone , the @xmath69 line , and the sources probably play an extremely important role in determining the wave energy distribution as a function of frequency . all the variables in the simulation",
    "are extracted at constant geometrical height ( 200 km above the photosphere ) , clearly a simplification incongruent with reality . whether the observation height is a significant contributor is yet to be determined .",
    "further investigations are currently in progress and will be the focus of a future paper .",
    "we have discussed and validated a numerical method to systematically study linear mhd interactions in the context of helioseismology .",
    "the importance of including the ambient atmospheric magnetic field in the vicinity of magnetic flux concentrations is underlined here . through a phenomenological model of the gradient smoothing that the ambient magnetic field presumably effects , we have shown that there can be significant differences in estimates of the oscillation velocity inside active regions .",
    "thus , forward models that attempt to recover the magnetic field distribution based on shifts in travel times or other helioseismic metrics must in fact address this issue .",
    "computational studies pertaining to oscillation power reduction in active regions are also quite sensitive to these effects .",
    "results from simulations of waves interacting with 600 and 3000 g strong flux tubes are discussed in some detail .",
    "not only is a significant reduction in wave power observed but a halo that surrounds the flux tube is also seen .",
    "many features in the velocity observations of active regions are reproduced by the simulations .",
    "high frequency wave power halos are also observed to envelope solar active regions ; @xcite , @xcite and @xcite suggest enhanced seismic emission in the vicinity as being the causative mechanism .",
    "however , the simulations contain no such seismic enhancements , indicating that the physics behind the formation of the halo is possibly governed by mhd phenomena . a theory to explain the appearance of these excess oscillations",
    "will be discussed in a future publication .",
    "using the techniques described here , we wish to develop helioseismically consistent forward models of thin flux tubes and sunspots . in the context of thin flux tube models , preliminary investigations",
    "have already shown that the peak flux tube magnetic field strengths of about 80 g @xcite as observed by the mdi instrument are too small by two orders of magnitude to cause the observed wave phase shifts .",
    "this is a consequence of the relatively low resolution of mdi , which is unable to capture the 100 - 200 km sized flux tubes ( tom duvall , jr .",
    "2007 ; tom bogdan 2007 ; robert cameron 2007 , various private communications ) . simulations with such small features can be computationally challenging due to resolution restrictions and the associated computational overhead .",
    "however , interesting sub - wavelength physics associated with thin flux tubes , namely the near - field evanescent modes ( the @xmath70 , e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be studied in greater detail with these simulations .",
    "these investigations are exciting , especially seen in the context of the availability of high quality observations and the upcoming solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) mission .",

    "<S> comprehending the manner in which magnetic fields affect propagating waves is a first step toward constructing accurate helioseismic models of active region sub - surface structure and dynamics . here , we present a numerical method to compute the linear interaction of waves with magnetic fields embedded in a solar - like stratified background . </S>",
    "<S> the ideal magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations are solved in a 3-dimensional box that straddles the solar photosphere , extending from 35 mm within to 1.2 mm into the atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> one of the challenges in performing these simulations involves generating a magneto - hydro - static ( mhs ) state wherein the stratification assumes horizontal inhomogeneity in addition to the strong vertical stratification associated with the near - surface layers . keeping in mind that the aim of this effort is to understand and characterize linear mhd interactions , we discuss a means of computing statically consistent background states . </S>",
    "<S> power maps computed from simulations of waves interacting with thick flux tubes of peak photospheric field strengths 600 g and 3000 g are presented . </S>",
    "<S> strong modal power reduction in the ` umbral ' regions of the flux tube enveloped by a halo of increased wave power are seen in the simulations with the thick flux tubes . </S>",
    "<S> these enhancements are also seen in doppler velocity power maps of active regions observed in the sun , leading us to propose that the halo has mhd underpinnings . </S>"
