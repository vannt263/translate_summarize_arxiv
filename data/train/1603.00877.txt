    "a variety of very - high - energy ( vhe ; @xmath1  gev ) @xmath2-ray sources have been discovered in the galactic plane by recent systematic surveys with the high energy stereoscopic system ( h.e.s.s . ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the majority of these sources are galactic objects with extended structures such as supernova remnants ( snrs ) , evolved pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) , or molecular clouds .",
    "unresolved or point - like h.e.s.s .",
    "sources in the galactic plane have been identified with galactic high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , or young pwne ( e.g. , crab nebula ) . on the other hand , outside of the galactic plane , the vast majority of the unresolved @xmath2-ray sources are radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "more than 50 agns have been detected in vhe @xmath3-ray regime so far , which are mostly blazars of the bl lacertae type ( hereafter bl lacs ) .",
    "the unresolved , steady tev source hess  j1943 + 213 ( henceforth j1943 + 213 ) was discovered in the galactic plane with three - years h.e.s.s .",
    "observations between 2005 and 2008 @xcite .",
    "the nature of j1943 + 213 is puzzling and subjected to an ongoing debate .",
    "it is located within the @xmath4 error circle of an unidentified hard x - ray _ integral _ source igr j19443 + 2117 , which was also seen with _ rosat _ , _ chandra _ and _ swift _ @xcite .",
    "@xcite discussed in detail the agn and pwn identification of j1943 + 213 and , based on the gathered multi - wavelength data , concluded that the most likely classification of the source is that of an `` extreme high - frequency - peaked bl lac object '' ( `` extreme hbl '' for short ) .",
    "on the other hand , following - up radio observations with optically - connected stations in european vlbi network ( e - evn mode ) revealed a compact radio counterpart to the tev emitter , j1943 + 2113 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth ) .",
    "reported non - detection of signals on the longest baselines between european stations and the african station at hartebeesthoek ( hh ) , indicative of a source extension on milliarcsecond - scale .",
    "this , along with the derived low brightness temperature , argued against the blazar identification . @xcite reported the hi absorption spectrum indicating the source distance exceeding 16  kpc .",
    "however , it is not conclusive evidence for its extragalactic origin , since it can still be a pwn at a distance of @xmath517  kpc .",
    "recently , new x - ray observations of j1943 + 213 with _",
    "suzaku _ have been reported by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) , who re - analyzed also the infrared data for the source from the wise and ukidss surveys , as well as the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( _ fermi_/lat ) data integrated over 4.5  years ( yielding the gev flux upper limits improved over those derived in @xcite ) .",
    "the best - quality x - ray spectrum revealed a single power - law continuum extending up to 25  kev , with a moderate absorption in excess of the galactic value .",
    "moreover , the re - analyzed infrared data have been found to be consistent with the presence of a luminous elliptical host located at the luminosity distance of @xmath6  mpc .",
    "all these findings , together with the broad - band modeling of the source spectral energy distribution ( sed ) performed by in the framework of the extreme hbl scenario , supported the blazar identification of j1943 + 213 .",
    "this was further substantiated by @xcite , who carried - out near - infrared imaging of the host candidate with the caha telescope , and also reported the source detection in the accumulated five - year - long _ fermi_/lat dataset .",
    "note that @xcite have recently reported on the arecibo observations failing to uncover the putative pulsar powering the pwn , again supporting the extreme hbl scenario .",
    "coverages of evn observations .",
    "the black curves indicate the @xmath7coverage of 2011 observations with e - evn , while the red curves correspond to the @xmath7coverage of our new evn observations in 2014 .",
    "[ fig : uv - coverage ] ]    the small - scale radio structure of j1943 + 213 is the remaining key puzzle in the discussion regarding the nature of the source . although the previous high - sensitivity e - evn observations have enabled to successfully detect and locate the radio counterpart to j1943 + 213 , the corresponding spatial resolution and imaging sensitivity were rather limited by poor @xmath7coverages due to the lack of other evn stations and hour - angle coverages .",
    "more sensitive observations at higher angular resolution are therefore indispensable for a proper characterization of the source at radio frequencies .    in this letter",
    ", we report on the new evn observations of j1943 + 213 , combined with the re - analysis of the e - evn data taken in 2011 ( from ) .",
    "our new evn observations with nearly full array provide the deepest image of the radio structure of j1943 + 213 on milliarcsecond scales at the highest achievable resolution .",
    "we reduced the archival e - evn data for j1943 + 213 at 1.6  ghz , which were presented before in .",
    "observations were performed with seven telescopes , as summarized in table  [ tab : obs - sum ] , at a recording rate of 1024  mbit  s@xmath8 on may 2011 for @xmath9  h. the total bandwidth was 128  mhz per polarization .",
    "initial calibrations were performed in the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "the visibility amplitudes were calibrated in the aips task apcal based on the system temperature and aperture efficiency measured at each station .",
    "we found that non - detections of fringes on the longest baselines from european telescopes to the hh station in africa reported in are not owing to the extended structure .",
    "performed phase - reference vlbi observations towards j1943 + 213 , since the source position was highly uncertain , and calibrated the data with the evn pipeline . in the pipeline processing ,",
    "the visibility phase was calibrated with the nearby phase calibrator j1946 + 2300 .",
    "we found that no fringes were detected on hh baselines for j1946 + 2300 in the pipeline calibrations , because the source structure is resolved out in long baselines .",
    "this would be the reason why missed the fringes also in the case of j1943 + 213 , where the fringe - search solutions of j1946 + 2300 were applied .    ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     importantly , due to the fact that the source appears more compact in the new evn data ( and also in the re - analyzed e - evn data ) than reported previously , also the source brightness temperature is higher than that derived in . in particular , from the standard formula @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13/@xmath14 are the flux density , observation frequency , and the major-/minor - axis size of the beam or of the gaussian component , respectively ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we find the peak brightness temperature of @xmath15  k for the peak intensity of the image 19.9  mjy  beam@xmath8 .",
    "note that since the core component is only marginally resolved , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] ( see also table  [ tab : cgauss ] ) , the corresponding uncertainties in the derived value of @xmath16 are relatively large ; still , the peak value of @xmath15  k corresponds to the safe _ lower _",
    "limit for the source brightness temperature .",
    "previous surveys of bl lacs found typical peak intensities of a few to 100  mjy  beam@xmath8 at 8  ghz ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ) and @xmath5  10 - 100  mjy beam@xmath8 at 1.6  ghz @xcite , corresponding to the brightness temperatures of @xmath17  k. recently , @xcite reported typical peak brightness temperatures of @xmath18  k for the analyzed sample of 20 bl lac objects detected at tev photon energies .",
    "the peak intensity and peak brightness temperature derived here for j1943 + 213 are therefore consistent with those characterizing bl lacs in general , and tev bl lacs in particular .    on the other hand , the other components in the j1943 + 213 jet are fairly resolved , with the corresponding brightness temperature of @xmath19  k , again in agreement to what is observed in other bl lac objects @xcite .",
    "we also note that the brightness temperatures of all our gaussian components are anyway much larger than the brightness temperatures of @xmath20  k and @xmath21  k at 1.4  ghz measured for the paradigmatic pwne crab @xcite and 3c  58 @xcite .",
    "our new observations provide a very strong , basically even conclusive evidence for the blazar identification of the enigmatic tev emitter j1943 + 213 : the milliarcsecond - scale structure of the source displays a core  jet morphology and a high brightness temperature , both of which are characteristic of hbls as a class ( and at the same time inconsistent with radio properties of galactic pwne ) .      extreme hbls form a peculiar sub - class of bl lac objects , with intrinsic ( i.e. , corrected for the absorption on the extragalactic background light )",
    "tev spectra equivalent to , or even harder than @xmath22 .",
    "such spectra , in the framework of conventional one - zone synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) models widely applied to broad - band seds of tev bl lacs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , requires rather extreme physical conditions within blazar emitting zones , and in particular very high jet bulk lorentz factors , @xmath23 , weak jet magnetic fields , @xmath24  mg , and very high minimum energies of ultra - relativistic jet electrons , @xmath25 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , @xmath26 , @xmath27 mg , and @xmath28 have been estimated by from the one - zone ssc modeling of the broad - band spectrum of j1943 + 213 .",
    "we note that up to now only about 10 extreme hbls are known .",
    "our observations reveal also a very low `` x - ray defined radio - loudness '' of j1943 + 213 , which is however comparable to those characterizing other extreme hbls , with typical x - ray - to - radio flux ratios of , roughly , @xmath29 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we measure the j1943 + 213 core flux spectral energy density of @xmath526.1  mjy , which corresponds to the monochromatic energy flux of @xmath30  erg  @xmath31  s@xmath8 . meanwhile , the _ suzaku _",
    "0.525  kev spectrum of the source ( ) extrapolated down to lower photon energies , returns @xmath32  erg  @xmath31  s@xmath8 . these result in @xmath33 , providing yet another evidence in support of the blazar identification of j1943 + 213 .",
    "two - epoch vlbi observations with evn do not show significant flux variations , which might be consistent with previous x - ray and tev @xmath3-ray observations showing no time variability at x - ray and tev bands @xcite .",
    "although the statistical errors of the total flux are small ( @xmath34 errors are 0.09  mjy and 0.02  mjy for 2011 and 2015 data , respectively ) , if we adopt typical _ a - priori _ calibration errors of @xmath35  % for evn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the total flux densities of @xmath36  mjy in 2014 and 34@xmath37  mjy in 2011 are mostly consistent within @xmath38 . however , a flux density of @xmath39  mjy was recently reported on e - merlin observations at 1.5  ghz in 2013 december and 2014 june @xcite , which would be an evidence for the flux variation combined with our data @xcite .",
    "since all of four vlbi observations were performed with quite different @xmath40-coverages and arrays , more homogeneous observations will be necessary to conclusively confirm the flux variations .",
    "we remark that , since the source is close to the galactic plane , the flux variation in radio regimes can be _ extrinsic _ due to the interstellar scintillation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for instance , the refractive scale of the interstellar scintillation at the source region is 2.81  mas at 1.6 ghz estimated from the ne2001 model @xcite , which is comparable to the fwhm size of the radio core .",
    "this suggests that a source with the angular size of @xmath41  mas can be modulated by refractive interstellar scattering , and therefore the radio core can be extrinsically scintillated ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "it is instructive to evaluate the source compactness ( sc ; e.g. ) and the core dominance ( cd ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of j1943 + 213 , for a direct comparison with other bl lacs .",
    "the sc is defined as a ratio of total flux densities ( or powers ) measured on milliarcsecond and arcsecond scales . on the other hand ,",
    "the cd is the ratio between the observed core radio power and the expected core radio power estimated from the umbeamed total radio power at lower frequencies , based on the relation given in @xcite .",
    "the cd is a good proxy of the jet doppler factor for blazar sources .    the total flux density of j1943 + 213 on arcsecond scales at 1.4  ghz , as measured with the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) , is @xmath42  mjy , giving the sc of @xmath43 . adopting the source distance of 600  mpc ,",
    "as advocated in , the total radio power of j1943 + 213 on milliarcsecond and arcsecond scales reads as @xmath44  w  hz@xmath8 and @xmath45  w  hz@xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the unbeamed core radio power is estimated to be @xmath46  w  hz@xmath8 , assuming the average spectrum index of 0.7 between 408  mhz and 1.4  ghz , following .",
    "this gives the cd of 30 .",
    "the estimated sc and cd are in the range of typical values found for blazars , where the vlbi scale core flux density is strongly enhanced by the doppler beaming .",
    "moreover , they are qualitatively consistent with the large doppler factor inffered from the one - zone ssc model applied by to the sed of j1943 + 213 .",
    "this again supports the blazar identification of the source , and implies that there is nothing unusual about it _ as long as small - scale radio properties are considered_.      j1943 + 213 has been detected with h.e.s.s . at tev",
    "photon energies _ only _ because it happened to be located close to the galactic plane , and as such it was covered by the h.e.s.s",
    ". galactic plane survey .",
    "note in this context that till now no systematic tev survey has been carried out at high galactic latitudes by the currently operating cherenkov telescopes .",
    "at the same time , the source is very weak in the gev range , so that it could be detected ( at a marginal level and in a limited energy range ) only after five years of the accumulation of the all - sky _ fermi_/lat data .",
    "the serendipitous h.e.s.s .",
    "discovery has triggered the follow - up x - ray , near - infrared @xcite , and high - resolution radio ( , this letter ) observations , which enabled to identify the source as a blazar of the `` extreme hbl '' type .",
    "remarkably , at optical and infrared frequencies , j1943 + 213 lacks any signatures of an agn activity . in other words , if not the particular location of j1943 + 213 on the sky , this object would never be recognized , targeted , and classified as a blazar the first place .",
    "the question is if j1943 + 213 is an anomaly / outliers in the diverse blazar population , or if it represents possibly quite numerous population of previously unrecognized , particularly extreme hbls . since h.e.s.s",
    "found this source over the 1224  deg@xmath47 survey @xcite , one can expect @xmath48 sources detectable with a sensitivity of existing chelenkov telescopes over the whole sky , which are already three times larger than the known population of extreme hbls .",
    "this relevant question can be addressed in the near future only by performing a systematic survey of nearby and seemingly `` quiet '' elliptical galaxies with hard x - ray satellites ( nustar , astro - h ) , high - resolution radio interferometers ( vlbi ) , and sensitive tev telescopes ( cherenkov telescope array ) .",
    "here we present the new evn observations of hess  j1943 + 213 at 1.6  ghz .",
    "our results provide a very strong , basically even conclusive evidence for the blazar identification of this enigmatic tev emitter :    1 .",
    "our high - resolution radio maps reveal that the milliarcsecond - scale structure of j1943 + 213 displays a clear core  jet morphology , which is typically seen in low - luminosity blazars",
    ". the brightness temperatures of the core and other small - scale jet components are consistent with those established for the tev - emitting bl lacs as well , and at the same time inconsistent with radio properties of galactic pwne .",
    "careful re - analysis of previous e - evn observations performed in 2011 provides a robust fringe detections on long baselines .",
    "the obtained source structure is broadly consistent with our new observations .",
    "the radio source compactness , radio core dominance and the x - ray  to  radio flux ratio characterizing j1943 + 213 , are all in agreement to what is observed in other extreme hbls , and are indicative of a significant doppler beaming shaping radio appearance of the source on milliarcsecond scales .    as such , j1943 + 213  which lack any optical / infrared signatures of an agn activity",
    " may be either an outliers in the diverse blazar population , or a member of a numerous population of previously unrecognized , particularly extreme hbls .",
