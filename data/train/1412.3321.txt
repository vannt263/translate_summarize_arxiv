    "one prominent representative of quantum states which reaches the heisenberg limit is the two - mode , quantum entangled n00n state  @xcite .",
    "the name originates from its expansion in fock bases : @xmath5 n00n states are bell - like entangled states . besides the application in quantum metrology  @xcite they are also of interest in quantum lithography  @xcite . by employing n00n states , a phase supersensitivity ",
    "i.e. , a phase estimation better than any classical estimation  in a mach - zehnder interferometer can be achieved . several strategies to generate such states have been proposed and experimentally implemented ; see , e.g. ,  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "in addition to quantum metrology , secure communication based on quantum key distribution ( qkd ) is another vital topic of current research  @xcite .",
    "although qkd is already used commercially , it is still restricted to relatively small transmission range . in systems using optical fibers",
    "the loss has a typical magnitude of @xmath6 /  @xcite , which renders it possible to preserve entanglement up to a @xmath7 propagation distance  @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is the quantum communication through free - space links .",
    "qkd in such links was demonstrated for an atmospheric channel of @xmath8  @xcite and recent experiments show the feasibility of global communication via orbiting satellites ; see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the implemented protocols use postselection strategies . in order to benefit from free - space qkd it is crucial to study the turbulent losses occurring within such a link .",
    "the first consistent quantum description of turbulent loss channels was introduced in terms of fluctuating transmission coefficients  @xcite .",
    "qkd employs entangled states as a resource .",
    "one of the most frequently used methods for determining this kind of quantum correlation in the bipartite case is formulated in terms of negativity of the partial transposition ( pt ) of the density operator . in this way entanglement",
    "is tested by transposing one of the involved modes while leaving the other one unchanged .",
    "if this partially transposed state can not fulfill the positivity required for quantum states the considered quantum system is entangled  @xcite .    in this contribution",
    "we study mixtures of n00n states propagating in atmospheric channels .",
    "we show that the superior phase - estimation properties can surpass perturbations within interferometric setups without postselection .",
    "entanglement is tested by the partial transpose criterion .",
    "in particular , the entanglement properties are studied in the case of turbulent losses occurring in urban free - space links . surprisingly simple conditions are deduced to infer sub - standard quantum limit behavior of phase estimation .",

    "such a generalization is natural , considering a possible scheme of generating n00n states .",

    "eventually , we will formulate a general family of quantum states which are based on mixed n00n states including all previously considered perturbations .      here",
    "we will focus on one previously implemented generation of n00n states by using coherent and squeezed vacuum states at the input ports of a symmetric beam splitter .",
    "such a generation strategy has been studied in theory  @xcite and has been successfully applied in experiments  @xcite .",
    "for example , any path entangled n00n state for any @xmath9 can in principle be generated in this form with a fidelity of at least @xmath10  @xcite . in the experiments conducted so far , e.g. ,  @xcite ,",
    "this generation strategy was used in mach - zehnder interferometers with the aim of surpassing the standard quantum limit . via coincidence measurements",
    "the @xmath9-fold super - resolution was demonstrated for up to @xmath11 . analyzing the two mode photon number statistics of the state in the interferometer",

    "<S> quantum metrology and quantum information necessitate a profound study of suitable states . </S>",
    "<S> attenuations induced by free - space communication links or fluctuations in the generation of such states limit the quantum enhancement in possible applications . for this reason we investigate quantum features of mixtures of so - called n00n states propagating in atmospheric channels . </S>",
    "<S> first , we show that noisy n00n states can still yield a phase resolution beyond classical limitations . </S>",
    "<S> second , we identify entanglement of noisy n00n states after propagation in fluctuating loss channels . </S>",
    "<S> to do so , we apply the partial transposition criterion . </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical analysis formulates explicit bounds which are indispensable for experimental verification of quantum entanglement and applications in quantum metrology . </S>"
