    "during a relative long period , it is well - known that there is a great difference between ( at least ) the mathematical levels of the investigation of quantum phenomena in different regions",
    ". really , in the area of the so - called strings ( math)physics , one needs all existing machinery , like deformation quantization , non - commutative geometry , etc . [ 1 ] while more applicable in real life quantum mechanics / physics uses old routines mainly .",
    "of course , physics at planckian scales demands a new vision regarding physics of ( realizable ) quantum devices ( like future cpu ) but , at the same time , we deal with the same phenomenon ( at least on qualitative level ) .",
    "it is impossible to imagine that some hypothetical object can be more quantum or less quantum .",
    "it seems that it can be only quantum or not quantum , i.e. classical ( surely , we ignore , at the moment , quasi - classics ) . at the same time",
    ", even advanced modern mathematics can not help us in the final ( at least practically accepted ) analysis of the long standing quantum phenomena and the final classification of a zoo of interpretations .",
    "the well - known incomplete list is as follows [ 2 ] :    * (",
    "l )  * entanglement , measurement , wave function collapse , decoherence , copenhagen interpretation , consistent histories , many - worlds interpretation / multiverse ( mwi ) , bohm interpretation , ensemble interpretation , ( dirac ) self - interference , `` instantaneous '' quantum interaction , hidden variables , etc .    as a result , beyond a lot of fundamental advanced problems at planckian scales we are still even unready to create the proper theoretical background for the reliable modeling and constructing of quantum devices far away from planckian scales .",
    "so , let us expose one more approach in an attempt to understand , in unified framework , some set of well - known phenomena .",
    "let us presume that quantum dynamics can be properly described as a part of local quantum physics [ 3 ] via wigner - weyl - moyal and/or deformation quantization approach which covers other ones .",
    "it means that :    * i ) * we use the language , machinery and ideology of the theory of pseudo - differential operators ;    * ii ) * we work with the symbols of operators instead of the operators ;    * iii ) * quantum evolution is described by ( pseudo - differential ) wigner - like equations ( wigner - von neumann - moyal - lindblad ) ;    * iv ) * the adequate analysis of the full set of possible phenomena described by iii ) demands the using of microlocal analysis ( although there are some phenomena which can be described more traditionally ) [ 4 ] ;    * v ) * we need to consider quantum state not as a function but as a sheaf [ 4 ] .",
    "it is more proper ( at least from formal , mathematical , point of view ) if we really want to take into account a lot of internal arguments from points i)-iv ) above .",
    "it is very hard to believe that trivial simple solutions , like gaussians , can exhaust all variety of possible quantum states needed for the resolution of all contradictions , hidden inside the list * ( l ) * mentioned above .",
    "so , let us propose the following natural ( physical ) hypothesis :    * ( h1 )  * * the physically reasonable really existing quantum states can not be described by means of functions .",
    "quantum state is a complex pattern which demands a set / class of functions / patches instead of one function for proper description and understanding . *",
    "there is nothing unusual in * ( h1 )  * for physicists since dirac s description of monopole .",
    "all the more , there is nothing unusual for mathematicians who successfully used sheaves , germs , etc in different areas .",
    "definitely , the introducing of * ( h1 ) * causes a number of standard topics , the most important of them are motivations , formal ( exact ) definition and ( at least ) particular realizations .",
    "really , why need we to change our ideology after a century ( since planck ) of success ?",
    "the answer is trivial and related to the list * ( l ) * which is overcompleted with contradictions and misunderstanding after many decades of discussions .",
    "in the following description , it is possible to find some features or reminiscences of previous models and interpretations from the list * l * , where the most important points for allusions are the hidden parameters , localization , ensemble / statistical interpretation , mwi , dirac s `` self - interference '' .",
    "let us sketch the main ingredients .",
    "* 1)*.  arena for quantum evolution    first of all , we need to divide the kinematical and dynamical features of a set of quantum states ( @xmath0 ) . from the formal point of view",
    "it means that one needs to consider some bundle @xmath1 whose sections are the so - called @xmath2 functions or @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath3 is ( kinematical ) space - time base space with the proper kinematical symmetry group ( like galilei or poincare ones ) , @xmath4 is a total formal hilbert space and @xmath5 are fibers with their own internal structures and hidden symmetries .",
    "in addition , such a bundle has the corresponding structure group which connects different fibers .",
    "of course , in a very particular case we have the constant bundle with the trivial structure group but non - trivial fiber symmetry . anyway , as we shall demonstrate later , it is very reasonable to provide the one - to - one correspondence between quantum states and the proper sections    @xmath6    as a result , we have , at least , three different symmetries inside this construction :    * kinematical one on space - time , hidden one inside each fiber and the gauge - like structure group of the bundle as a whole . *",
    "it is obvious that the kinematical laws ( like relativity principles ) depend on the proper type of symmetry and are absolutely different in the base space and in the fibers .",
    "it should be noted that the functional realizations of fibers and the total space are very important for our aims .",
    "roughly speaking , it can be supposed that physical effects depend on the type of the particular functional realization of formal ( infinite dimensional ) hilbert space .",
    "e.g. , it is impossible to use infinite smooth approximations , like gaussians , for the reliable modeling of chaotic / fractal phenomena .",
    "so , the part of physics at quantum scales is encoded in the details of the proper functional realization .",
    "localization and a tower of scales *    it is well - known that nobody can prove that gaussians ( or even standard coherent states , etc ) are an adequate and proper image for quantum states really existing in the nature .",
    "we can suggest that at quantum scales other classes of functions or , more generally , other functional spaces ( not @xmath7 , e.g. ) with the proper bases describe the underlying physical processes .",
    "there are two key features we are interested in .",
    "first of all , we need the best possible localization properties for our trial base functions .",
    "second , we need to take into account , in appropriate form , all contributions from all internal hidden scales , from coarse - grained to finest ones . of course , it is a hypothesis but it looks very reasonable :    * ( h2 )  * * there is a ( infinite ) tower of internal scales in quantum region that contributes to the really existing quantum states and their evolution .",
    "so , we may suppose that the fundamental generating physical `` eigen - modes '' correspond to a selected functional realization and are localized in the best way .",
    "let us note the role of the proper hidden symmetries which are responsible for the quantum self - organization and resulting complexity .",
    "an ensemble of scales : self - interaction *    as a result of the description above , we may have non - trivial `` interaction '' inside an infinite hierarchy of modes or scales .",
    "it resembles , in some sense , a sort of turbulence or intermittency .",
    "of course , here the generating avatar is a representation theory of hidden symmetries which create the non - trivial dynamics of this ensemble of hierarchies .    *",
    "hidden parameters and hidden symmetry *    it is well - known that symmetries generate all things ( at least ) in fundamental physics . here , we have a particular case where the generic symmetry corresponds to the internal hidden symmetry of the underlying functional realization . moreover , as it is proposed above",
    ", we have even the more complicated structure because we believe that @xmath0 is not a function but a sheaf . as a result , we have interaction between two different symmetries , namely hidden symmetry in the fiber , that corresponds to the internal symmetry of the functional realization , and the structure `` gauge '' group of a sheaf , which provides multifibers transition / dynamics",
    ". both these algebraic structures can be parametrized by the proper group parameters which can play the role of famous `` hidden variables '' introduced many decades ago .    * 5 ) .",
    "mwi *    of course , mwi or multiverse interpretation can be covered by the structure sketched above .",
    "quantum states are the sections of our fundamental sheaf , so we can consider them as a collection of maps between the patches of base space and fibers .",
    "all such maps simultaneously exist and , as an equivalence class , represent the same quantum state .",
    "we postpone the detailed description to the next section but here let us mention that each member of the full family can be considered as an object belonged to some fixed world .",
    "obviously , before measurement we can not distinguish samples but after measurement we shall have the only copy in our hands .",
    "the main reason to introduce sheaves as a useful instrument for the analysis of quantum states is related to their main property which allows to assign to every region @xmath8 in space - time @xmath3 some family @xmath9 of algebraic or geometric objects such as functions or differential operators .",
    "the family can be restricted to smaller regions , and the compatible collections of families can be glued to give a family over larger regions , so it provides connection between small and large scales , local and global data .",
    "informal construction is as follows .",
    "let @xmath3 be the space - time base space ( some topological space ) with a system of open subsets @xmath10 , then for every @xmath8 and map @xmath11",
    "the image @xmath9 is some object with internal structure ( more generally , @xmath9 takes values in some category @xmath12 ) such that for every two open subsets , @xmath8 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 there is the so - called restriction map ( more generally , morphism in the category @xmath12 ) , @xmath15 ( restriction morphism ) .    a map @xmath11 will be a * presheaf * if restriction morphism satisfies the following properties :    * ( a ) * for every open subset @xmath10 , the restriction morphism @xmath16 is the identity morphism ,    * ( b ) * if there are three open subsets @xmath17 , then @xmath18 .",
    "this property provides the connection or ordering of the underlying scales .",
    "in other words , let @xmath19 be the category of open sets on @xmath3 , whose objects are the open sets of @xmath3 and whose morphisms are inclusions .",
    "then a presheaf @xmath20 on @xmath3 with values in category @xmath12 is the contravariant functor from @xmath19 to @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath9 is called the section of @xmath20 over @xmath8 and we consider it as some pre - image for adequate quantum state @xmath21 .",
    "but our goal , in this direction , is a * sheaf * , so we need to add two additional properties .",
    "let @xmath22 be some family of open subsets of @xmath3 , @xmath23 .    * ( c ) * if @xmath24 and @xmath25 are two elements of @xmath9 and @xmath26 for every @xmath27 , then @xmath28 .    *",
    "( d ) * for every @xmath29 let a section @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 are compatible if , for all @xmath29 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "for every set @xmath31 of compatible sections on @xmath34 , there exists the unique section @xmath35 such that @xmath36 for every @xmath37 .",
    "the section @xmath38 is called the gluing of the sections @xmath39 .    definitely , we can consider this property as allusion to the hypothesis of wave function collapse .",
    "really , @xmath38 looks as multiverse quantum state ensemble @xmath40 while @xmath41 is the result of measurement in the patch @xmath27 .",
    "and it is unique !",
    "the next step is to specify the quantum category @xmath12 .",
    "according to our hypothesis @xmath42 , we consider the category of the functional realization of ( infinite - dimensional ) hilbert spaces with proper filtration , which allows to take into account multiscale decomposition for all dynamical quantities needed for the description of quantum evolution .",
    "the well - known type of such filtration is the so - called multiresolution decomposition .",
    "it should be noted that the whole description is much more complicated because it demands the consideration of both structures together , namely , the fiber structure generated by internal hidden symmetry of the chosen functional realization and the family of gluing sections @xmath38 in the unified framework .",
    "in the companion paper [ 7 ] , we shall consider in details one important realization of this construction based on the local nonlinear harmonic analysis which has , as the key ingredient , the so - called multiresolution analysis ( mra ) [ 5 ] .",
    "it allows us to describe internal hidden dynamics on a tower of scales [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] . introducing the fock - like space structure on the whole space of internal hidden scales",
    ", we have the following mra decomposition ( refs . [",
    "9]-[22 ] for related methods , approaches , models ) :    @xmath43    for the set of n - partial wigner functions ( states ) :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 , @xmath46 ( or any different proper functional space ) , with the natural fock space like norm : @xmath47    now we consider some phenomenological description which presents some attempt of the qualitative description of quantum dynamics as a whole and in comparison with its classical counterpart .",
    "it is possible to take , for reminiscence , the famous dirac s phrase that `` an electron can interact only itself via the process of quantum interference '' .",
    "let @xmath48 be a hidden / internal symmetry group on the spaces of quantum states , which generates , via mra , the multiscale / multiresolution representation for all dynamical quantities , unified in object @xmath49 , such as states , observables , partitions ( e.g. , wigner quasi - distributions ) : @xmath50 , where @xmath29 is the proper scale index .",
    "then , the following commutative diagram represents the details of quantum life from the point of view of the representations of @xmath48 on the chosen functional realization which leads to the decomposition of the whole quantum evolution into the orbits or scales corresponding to the proper level of resolution .",
    "morphisms @xmath51 describe wigner - weyl evolution in the algebra of symbols , while the processes of interactions with open world , such as the measurement or decoherence , correspond to morphisms ( or even functors ) @xmath52 which transform the infinite set of scales , characterizing the quantum object , into finite ones , sometimes consisting of one element ( demolition / destructive measurement )    @xmath53    where the reduced morphisms @xmath54 correspond to ( semi)classical or quasiclassical evolution .",
    "qualitatively ,    * quantum objects *    can be represented by an infinite or sufficiently large set of coexisting and interacting subsets    while    * ( quasi)classical objects * can be described by one or a few only levels of resolution with ( almost ) suppressed interscale self - interaction .",
    "it is possible to consider wigner functions as some measure of the quantum character of the system : as soon as it becomes positive , we arrive to classical regime and so there is no need to consider the full hierarchy decomposition in the mra representation .",
    "so , dirac s self - interference is nothing else than the multiscale mixture / intermittency .",
    "certainly , the degree of this self - interaction leads to different qualitative types of behaviour , such as localized quasiclassical states , separable , entangled , chaotic etc . at the same time",
    ", the instantaneous quantum interaction or transmission of ( quantum ) information from alice to bob takes place not in the physical kinematical space - time but in hilbert spaces of quantum states in their proper functional realization where there is a different kinematic life .    to describe a set of quantum objects , we need to realize our space of states ( hilbert space ) not as one functional space but as the so - called and well known in mathematics , scale of spaces , e.g. @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "the proper multiscale decomposition for the scale of spaces provides us by the method of the description of a set of quantum objects in case if the `` size '' of one hilbert space of states is not enough to describe the complicated internal world .",
    "we will consider it elsewhere , while here we consider the one - scale case ( to avoid possible misunderstanding , we need to mention that one - scale case is also described by an infinite scale of spaces , but it is the internal decomposition of the unique , attached to the problem , hilbert space ) .",
    "definitely , the full family of sections of non - trivial sheaf , as a model of @xmath0 , demands to take into account the double - hierarchy of the underlying internal scales generated by means of the corresponding hidden symmetries . as a result , on the proper orbits ,",
    "we have nontrivial entangled dynamics , especially in contrast with its `` classical '' quantum orthodox counterpart .",
    "* how to get rid of geometrical points from quantum physics * +    ( reasonable ) questions :    * question 1 . *    is a geometrical point a good image / model for quantum object ?    if the answer on the q1 is `` possible , not  or ' ' definitely , not \" then the next question , q2 , is a direct consequence of q1 .",
    "* question 2 .",
    "*    is a ( point ) function ( standard , usual function ) a proper model for @xmath57 function and related objects ?",
    "if the answer is not , then we have hypothesis 1 :    * hypothesis 1 .",
    "*    quantum objects need to be defined on open sets ( in standard topological sense ) or some system of open sets , or , to be more precise mathematically , filtrations instead of one - point - sets ( geometrical points )    then , hypothesis 2 will be obvious :    * hypothesis 2 .",
    "*    sheaves are the proper realization for modeling quantum states / objects    one step more :    * question 3 . *    is the kinematics of space - time manifolds with a proper symmetry group , like poincare , e.g. , a generic object for understanding quantum paradoxes / interpretations , such as instantaneous interactions , nonlocality , hidden parameters , etc . ?",
    "moreover , can ( special ) relativity theory describe , in principle , instantaneous interaction between quantum objects ?",
    "if the answer is not , then    * hypothesis 3 .",
    "*    the most nontrivial quantum phenomena can be described by means of underlying hidden symmetry of functional realization of hilbert space of states generating the full zoo of quantum phenomena .",
    "of course , there is no contradiction with trivial kinematical laws ( relativity ) : these are two different coexisting objects .",
    "* the full generic symmetry is a unification of these symmetries .",
    "*    e.g. , the instantaneous quantum interaction is a phenomenon of function space kinematics ( with proper hidden symmetry ) but not an attribute of minkowskian kinematics .    roughly ( physically ) speaking , the quantum signal between quantum objects ( in the hands of alice and bob ) propagates along functional realization of hilbert space ( with its own kinematis , symmetry , etc . ) but not along minkowskian space - time with einsteinian relativity and underlying poincare symmetry .",
    "roughly ( mathematically ) speaking : physical laws at base space ( space  time manifold ) of generic fiber bundle ( or sheaf ) are different from physical laws at fibers / slices / sections and , moreover , from laws proper for the total space .    for the final analysis",
    "we need to unify all underlying ( mostly hidden ) generic symmetries to have a chance for right description .",
    "that is our point of view .",
    "( roughly ) mathematically speaking , we can summarize our approach in a form of diagram :",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     here @xmath58 are the three different generic symmetries generating three different sets of physical laws on the base ( kinematical ) space @xmath3 , on the fibers ( local hilbert spaces over local domains of base space ) , @xmath59 , and on the total quantum hilbert space / quantum sheaf , @xmath60 .",
    "it should be remembered that laws of kinematics ( einstein or galileo relativity ) , are attributes of the base space @xmath3 only while quantum laws need to be described by total quantum hilbert space and the full diagram above .",
    "so , the standard `` local''/ `` point function '' @xmath61 function ( left row ) is not enough to restore properly a full set of quantum data corresponding to quantum state ( qs ) . instead of that , we consider the full family of sections over open domains unified in a whole quantum sheaf as a correct representative of the real qs . correspondingly , the resulting `` microlocal / sheaf description '' [ 4 ] has a lot of additional possibilities to store full quantum information . as a result ,",
    "quantum dynamics in such a framework is more complicated and complex than in the standard `` orthodox '' case .",
    "so , in such a way we open new horizons and , at least , we get rid of the structureless geometrical points from quantum context .",
    "details will be considered elsewhere [ 23 ] .",
    "it seems very reasonable that there are no chances for the solution of long standing problems and novel ones if we constraint ourselves by old routines and the old zoo of simple solutions like gaussians , coherent states and all that .      in this respect , we can hope that our sheaf extension for representation of @xmath0 , which is natural from the formal point of view , may be very productive for the more deep understanding of the underlying ( quantum ) physics , especially , if we consider it together with the category of multiscale filtered functional realizations decomposed into the entangled orbits generated by actions of internal hidden symmetries .",
    "in such a way , we open a possibility for the exact description of a lot of phenomena like entanglement and measurement , wave function collapse , self - interference , instantaneous quantum interaction , multiverse , hidden variables , etc . in the companion paper [ 7 ]",
    "we consider the machinery needed for the generation of a zoo of the complex quantum patterns during wigner - weyl evolution .",
