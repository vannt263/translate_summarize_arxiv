    "the fastest variability components in x - ray binaries , the kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) , have been detected in about thirty neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries ( ns lmxbs ) since first discovered with rossi x - ray timing explorer in 1996 ( see van der klis 2006 for a review ) .",
    "twin khz qpos appeared simultaneously in about twenty ns lmxbs .",
    "these qpos are thought to reflect the motion of matter at the inner edge of an accretion disc around the ns .",
    "early observations showed that the frequency separation ( @xmath0 ) of the twin khz qpos is close to the ns spin frequency ( @xmath1 ) ( e.g. strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ; ford et al .",
    "1997 ) , suggesting a beat - frequency explanation ( miller , lamb & psaltis 1998 ) .",
    "however , the more detailed measurements revealed that @xmath0 is generally inconsistent with a constant value of @xmath1 but varying with the upper ( @xmath2 ) or lower ( @xmath3 ) frequency of the twin khz qpos ( van der klis et al .",
    "1997 ; mndez et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "stella & vietri ( 1999 ) propose a relativistic precession model which predicts a changing peak separation of the twin khz qpos .",
    "the upper and the lower khz qpo frequencies are identified with the keplerian frequency of the rotational plasma flow at the inner edge of the disc and the periastron precession frequency of the orbit , respectively . in this model ,",
    "the ns spin frequency plays no role in setting up the frequencies of the khz qpos , but a massive ( @xmath4 ) ns is usually required to match the observations .",
    "abramowicz et al . ( 2001 , 2003 ) suggest that the twin khz qpos can be explained by a nonlinear resonance in the epicyclic motion in the accretion disc , leading to the @xmath5 ratio of the upper and lower frequencies , although whether there is an intrinsically preferred ratio between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 is controversial ( belloni et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the subtle feature of twin khz qpos is that @xmath6 is variable but seems to be around either @xmath1 or @xmath7 ( smith , morgan & bradt 1997 ; wijnands & van der klis 1997 ; markwardt , strohmayer & swank 1999 ; chakrabarty et al 2003 ; wijnands et al .",
    "2003 ; barret , boutelier & miller 2008 ; see , however , yin et al . 2007 ; mndez & belloni 2007 ) .",
    "this has motivated some scenarios of khz qpos taking into account the effect of the ns spin .",
    "osherovich & titarchuk ( 1999 ) suggest that khz qpos could be modeled as oscillations of the blobs thrown into magnetosphere from the inner edge of the accretion disc .",
    "the lower khz qpo frequency @xmath3 is identified as the keplerian frequency in the disc and the upper frequency @xmath2 the hybrid frequency about the keplerian frequency and the ns spin frequency .",
    "lee , abramowicz & kluiak ( 2004 ) show that the khz qpos may be attributed to forcing of epicyclic motions in the accretion disc by the ns , which induces resonance at selected frequencies when the frequency separation @xmath6 is equal to @xmath1 or @xmath7 .",
    "li & zhang ( 2005 , see also zhang 2004 ) present an alternative interpretation for the origin of the twin khz qpos by considering the interaction between the ns magnetic field and the surrounding accretion disc , which gives rise to mhd loop oscillations at the inner edge of the disc with the frequencies depending on the spin frequencies .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a model to explain khz qpos in ns lmxbs based on the interaction of accreting plasma with the ns magnetosphere .",
    "this model is partially based on the interpretation of zhang ( 2004 ) and rezania & samson ( 2005 ) . in the latter work",
    "it was argued that distortion of the ns magnetosphere by the infalling plasma of the keplerian accretion flow can excite resonant shear alfvn waves in a region of enhanced density gradients , where accretion material flows along the magnetic field lines in the magnetosphere .",
    "the major difference between our model and rezania & samson s ( 2005 ) is that we have included the effect of the gravity and spin of the ns on the field line resonances .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the basic physical model and derive the relation between @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 . in section 3",
    "we compare the theoretical relations with the observational data of six sources ( 4u 0614@xmath809 , 4u 1608@xmath952 , 4u 1636@xmath953 , 4u 1728@xmath934 , 4u 1915@xmath905 , and xte 1807@xmath9294 ) . in section 4",
    "we summarized our results and discuss their possible implications .",
    "in lmxbs the plasma from the donor star accretes onto the ns via an accretion disc .",
    "material in the disc firstly rotates in a keplerian motion , then corotates with the magnetosphere after it is trapped completely by the ns magnetic field at the magnetospheric radius , and finally flows along the field lines to the polar cap .",
    "some resonant modes may be excited by the perturbations at the magnetospheric radius when the plasma begins to corotate with the magnetosphere ( osherovich & titarchuk 1999 ; lee et al .",
    "2004 ; zhang 2004 ; rezania & samson 2005 ) .",
    "we consider the qpos as a modulation effect of the mhd waves which are produced at the magnetospheric radius , and the coupling of the two resonant mhd modes may lead to the twin khz qpos in the power spectrum .",
    "we consider the mhd equations in a frame of reference corotating with the ns ( shown in fig .  1 ) , written as follows ( landau & lifshitz 1976 ) @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the plasma velocity , @xmath15 electric current , @xmath16 magnetic field , @xmath17 the displacement from the center of the ns to the plasma , @xmath18 plasma density , @xmath19 barometric pressure , @xmath20 adiabatic index , @xmath21 gravitational constant , @xmath22 and @xmath23 the mass and the angular velocity of the ns is the angular velocity of the ns magnetosphere , which could be slightly deviate from that of the ns .",

    "the third , fourth and fifth terms on the rhs of eq .",
    "( 1 ) represent the coriolis force , the centrifugal force and the gravity , respectively .",
    "observationally the accretion rates in lmxbs change on a timescale of @xmath24 .",
    "this is much more than the relaxation ( or dynamic ) timescale of the plasma at the inner disc radius ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "so we can approximate the plasma to be in an equilibrium state , which is subject to small perturbations , as discussed in benz ( 2002).by use of the current expression , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is is vacuum magnetic conductivity , eqs .",
    "( 1)-(3 ) can be transformed to be @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 where the subscript 0 denotes variables in the equilibrium state .",
    "the initial relative velocity ( @xmath31 ) is equal to zero in the corotating reference system and can be expressed as @xmath32 in the inertial reference system .",
    "now we consider the mhd equations for the plasma subject to small perturbations , @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 with the subscript s denoting the perturbed quantities ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) and with the superscript @xmath47 the variables after the disturbance .",

    "( 14)-(16 ) we get the following dispersion equations , @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 where @xmath65 is imaginary unit , @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) , @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) , @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) , and @xmath72 are alfvn velocity , acoustic velocity , keplerian angular velocity , and angular velocity of the perturbation at @xmath73 respectively , and @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 are the three components of the perturbed quantity of the speed . equations ( 17)-(19 ) show that there exist three resonance mhd modes . at the magnetospheric radius @xmath73 , the magnetic energy density is equal to the total kinetic energy density , i.e. @xmath77 ( davidson & ostriker 1973 ; ghosh et al .",
    "since the characteristic wavelength is in the same order with the magnetospheric radius ( rezania & samson 2005 ) , we then have @xmath78 , or @xmath79 . because the thermal pressure of the plasma might be comparable with the magnetic pressure ( @xmath80 ) just inside the magnetosphere ( miller et al .",
    "1998 ) , we also suppose @xmath81 . here both @xmath82 and @xmath83 are taken to be constant for certain sources .",

    "similarly when @xmath90 , @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 note that in the latter case the mhd wave could nt propagate very far in the accretion disc , so we consider the coupling modes that propagate along the @xmath53 axis ( @xmath94 ) as a more promising explanation of the qpos .",
    "we first rule out the possibility of the @xmath95 mode as the lower khz qpos , since eq .",
    "( 21 ) requires that it should always higher than @xmath96 for stable accretion , which is contradicted with observations .",
    "the coupling between @xmath97 and @xmath98 can also be excluded , which implies a constant frequency separation .",
    "so we suggest the upper and the lower khz qpo frequencies be @xmath99 and @xmath100 . from eqs .",

    "1998 ) . in this case",
    "the peak separation is equal to the spin frequency and almost invariant .",
    "in this paper we propose a resonant mhd model for the twin kilohertz qpos in lmxbs .",
    "the modes of the mhd waves vertical and parallel to the accretion disc are derived , and the twin khz qpos frequencies are identified with the frequencies of the two resonant modes . in this model",
    "the twin khz qpo frequencies are correlated with the spin frequencies , and the separation frequencies also change with the qpo frequencies .",
    "we show that the measured relations between @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath1 can be accounted for with reasonable values of the input parameters .",
    "there are several spin - involved mhd models for khz qpos in the literature .",
    "osherovich & titarchuk ( 1999 ) suggest that khz qpos can be explained as oscillations of large scale inhomogeneities ( hot blobs ) thrown into the ns magnetosphere .",
    "participating in the radial oscillations with keplerian frequency , such blobs are simultaneously under the influence of the coriolis force .",
    "the derived frequency relation is @xmath118 , or @xmath119 , which is plotted in the dotted curve in fig .",
    "the significant deviation from the measured data indicates that this model is not successful for most of the lmxbs . in their mhd loop oscillation model",
    "li & zhang ( 2005 ) derive a linear frequency relation , i.e. , @xmath120 where @xmath121 is an input parameter . here",
    "the upper khz qpo frequency is assumed to the keplerian frequency and the lower khz qpo is identified as the principal fast kink mode of the standing mhd waves along the toroidal field lines at the magnetospheric radius . the relation is also plotted in fig .  4 in solid curves .",
    "a comparison with the measured data shows that the fit is acceptable for all the six sources .",
    "rezania & samson ( 2005 ) propose a model for qpos in lmxbs based on oscillating magnetohydrodynamic modes in ns magnetospheres .",
    "they argue that the interaction of the accretion disc with the magnetosphere can excite resonant shear alfvn waves in a region of enhanced density gradients , where accretion material flows along the magnetic field lines in the magnetosphere .",
    "the predicted @xmath122 ratio is found to be independent of the ns spin frequencies .",
    "the main difference between rezania & samson ( 2005 ) and this work lies in that rezania & samson ( 2005 ) assume that the strong gravity of the ns produces a converging flow which will hit the star s magnetosphere in a large velocity , while we consider the motion of the plasma is still mainly keplerian , before they enter the magnetosphere and corotate with the magnetosphere .",
    "we also include the effect of the gravity and the rotation of the ns for the trapped plasma , and find that the resulting wave frequencies relate with both the spin frequency and the gravity .",
    "so far we have assumed that the spin and magnetic axes of the ns are aligned in lmxbs .",
    "however , the existence of persistent millisecond pulsations in some lmxbs indicates that the magnetic axis is at least somewhat tilted from the spin axis . in this case",
    "the magnetic field is no longer homogeneous at a given radius in the accretion disc , and the orbit of plasma in the inner region of the disc becomes non circular .",
    "furthermore , the stellar magnetic field can induce disk warping and precession ( e.g. lai 1999 , 2003 ) , and modulate the orbit and hence the qpo frequencies . for x - ray binaries",
    "the disc precession timescale is usually of tens of days to years ( cf .",
    "wijers & pringle 1999 and references therein ) , which is much longer than the duration of each qpo observation . additionally for accretion - powered millisecond pulsars",
    "the magnetic inclination is likely to be very small ( lamb et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "for the above reasons we expect that the change of the qpo frequencies induced by oblique magnetic fields might be very small compared with the uncertainties in the measured frequencies .",
    "our results indicate that the peak separation is always related to the spin frequency .",
    "what s more , there seems to be a weak positive correlation between the spin frequency and the parameter @xmath109 for sscs , which can be described as @xmath123 , plotted in the left panel of fig .",
    "5 . substitute this relation into @xmath124 we get a trend of @xmath125 changing with the spin frequency , as plotted in the right panel of fig .",
    "5 . from the dark black curve to the light gray curve @xmath3 changes from 1000 hz to 100 hz in a step of 100 hz .",
    "we find that when @xmath1 increases , @xmath116 varies from @xmath126 to @xmath127 , and finally to @xmath128 .",
    "the transitions occur at @xmath129 hz and 500 hz , respectively .",
    "the accretion process can take place only when the magnetospheric radius is less than the corotation radius ( e.g. ghosh & lamb 1979 ) .",
    "in other words , the keplerian frequency at the magnetosphere radius should be more than the spin frequency of the ns if accretion process can take place . because of this there is a minimum value of the lower frequency of the twin khz qpos in sscs , @xmath130 .",
    "besides , due to the fact that the peak separation must be positive values we can get the maximal value for the upper frequency , @xmath131 for sscs . these may serve as possible evidence to testify this model with future measurements of khz qpos in lmxbs .",

    "<S> we suggest an explanation for the twin kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) based on magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) oscillation modes in neutron star magnetospheres . including the effect of the neutron star spin , we derive several mhd wave modes by solving the dispersion equations , and propose that the coupling of the two resonant mhd modes may lead to the twin khz qpos . </S>",
    "<S> this model naturally relates the upper , lower khz qpo frequencies with the spin frequencies of the neutron stars , and can well account for the measured data of six lmxbs .    </S>",
