    "investigation of open charm and open strangeness production processes is one of major hadron physics programs at current or planned accelerator facilities which are supposed to provide pion beams  @xcite or antiproton beams  @xcite .",
    "these facilities are expected to produce high - quality beams at energies high enough to produce strange or charm hadrons .",
    "understanding the dynamics of charm and strange quarks is an interesting topic as their mass scale is between the light quark sector which is dominated by chiral symmetry and the heavy quark sector where heavy quark spin symmetry takes a crucial role .",
    "therefore , they are interpolating the two extreme regions and the deviations or corrections to chiral symmetry and heavy quark symmetry are crucial to understand the underlying dynamics of the strong interaction .",
    "the heavy mass of the charm quark , in particular , leads to a very rich hadron spectrum with open or hidden charm flavor , which includes exotic states that were not observed in the light quark sector .",
    "therefore , charm hadron spectroscopy is expected to open a new opportunity for unraveling the strong interaction . besides , many interesting ideas using charm flavor have been suggested , which include the utilization of charm particles as a probe of nuclear medium at maximum compression , the study of the properties of exotic @xmath7 mesons and so on  @xcite .",
    "one of the important issues which are not fully resolved at present is the charm / strangeness production mechanism in hadron reactions .",
    "since the reaction energy is not high enough to be treated asymptotically , the widely - used models for heavy quark production based on perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) are not applicable , and an essential improvement by including nonperturbative contributions is indispensable . in the perturbative qcd approaches , in fact",
    ", charm quarks are produced through gluon fragmentations . in order to produce charm quarks in peripheral collisions , however , such gluons must have a large momentum ( large @xmath8 ) , which is much larger than its average magnitude ( @xmath9 ) inside a nucleon . as a result",
    ", this mechanism can hardly be the major production mechanism for heavy flavor production at relatively low energies .",
    "therefore , it is legitimate to rely on the approaches based on non - perturbative qcd background for describing peripheral reactions . in the present work ,",
    "we adopt the quark - gluon string model ( qgsm ) developed by kaidalov and collaborators in refs .",
    "@xcite , which has been applied for the evaluation of cross sections of the exclusive @xmath10 production in @xmath11 and @xmath12 collisions  @xcite and in @xmath13 collisions  @xcite .",
    "a novel feature of this model is that the invariant amplitude of the binary reaction has a form of the regge amplitude , where the parameters of an effective `` reggeons '' are determined by unitary condition and additivity of intercepts and of inverse slopes of the regge trajectories .",
    "for such an effective reggeons or effective meson - trajectories exchanges , usually only the vector meson exchange is considered .",
    "since the intercept of vector meson trajectory is larger than that of the corresponding pseudoscalar trajectory with the same flavor quantum number , the exchange of pseudoscalar meson trajectory is expected to be suppressed .",
    "therefore , this model would be justified at large center - of - momentum energy squared @xmath14 and small magnitude of the squared momentum transfer @xmath15 . however , in order to fully understand the production mechanisms , more physical quantities should be examined other than cross sections . in particular , such physical quantities should be sensitive to the production mechanisms whose contribution to cross sections is relatively small .",
    "in fact , as we shall see below , the available data for @xmath0 production suggest that the vector meson trajectory exchange model needs to be modified to some extent .    in the present work ,",
    "we elaborate on the angular distributions of pseudoscalar mesons originated from the decays of vector mesons produced in @xmath16 collisions .",
    "more specifically , we consider the production of @xmath0 and @xmath1 vector mesons , which decay into @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively . therefore , the processes under consideration in the present work are the two - step reactions of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where we will specifically work on @xmath2 collisions .",
    "in particular , we focus on the angular distributions of @xmath21 and @xmath22 mesons produced by these reactions , which bear the information on the production mechanisms of @xmath0 and @xmath1 vector mesons .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "then , in sec",

    "the decay process of vector mesons is considered in its rest frame . in this case , the amplitude of the vector meson decay into two pseudoscalar mesons has the simple form of @xmath59 where the constant @xmath60 is related to the @xmath56 decay width @xmath61 as @xmath62 with @xmath48 being the magnitude of the three momentum of the final - state particles in the rest frame of the vector meson .",

    "recent studies of strangeness and charm production at a few dozen gev show that this cross section can be successfully evaluated in the framework of qgsm suggested by kaidalov  @xcite and later developed and refined in a number of theoretical works developed , for example , in refs .",
    "qgsm is based on the planar quark diagram decomposition and unitary conditions  @xcite , and it allows to represent the amplitude of the binary @xmath69 reaction in terms of an effective regge amplitude , where the effective trajectory @xmath70 and the energy scale parameter @xmath71 are determined by the well - established parameters of the elastic @xmath72 and @xmath73 reactions using so - called the planar diagram decomposition .",

    "one may choose the quantization axis anti - parallel to the outgoing hyperon @xmath24 in the center - of - momentum frame of the production process . or the quantization axis may be defined to be parallel to the incoming pion , i.e. , the initial beam direction . following the convention of ref .",

    "in addition , for unpolarized reaction , we also have the sum rule @xmath126 and the symmetry conditions , @xmath127 and @xmath128 . in the case of recoil polarization , however , these additional relations do not hold .    as was mentioned earlier",
    ", the purpose of the present work is to test the validity of the dominance of vector meson trajectory exchange .",
    "this assumption is based on the observation that the intercept of the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) vector meson , for instance , is larger than that of the corresponding pseudoscalar @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) meson trajectory  @xcite",
    ". however , other mechanisms can not be excluded , and the contribution from such mechanisms should be verified by physical quantities related to the spin structure of the production mechanisms .",
    "in fact , as we will see later , the available data for density matrix elements suggest that there exist contributions from mechanisms other than vector trajectory exchange .",

    "since we are interested in identifying the major production mechanisms , we need to be able to distinguish between the pseudoscalar meson trajectory exchange and the vector meson trajectory exchange through measurable physical quantities .",

    "<S> the production mechanisms of open strangeness ( @xmath0 ) and open charm ( @xmath1 ) vector mesons in @xmath2 scattering , namely , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , are investigated within the modified quark - gluon string model . in order to identify the major reaction mechanisms </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the subsequent decays of the produced vector mesons into two pseudoscalar mesons , i.e. , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the decay distributions and density matrix elements are sensitive to the production mechanisms and can be used to disentangle the vector trajectory and pseudoscalar trajectory exchange models . </S>",
    "<S> our results for @xmath0 production are compared with the currently available experimental data and the predictions for @xmath1 production processes are presented as well . </S>",
    "<S> our predictions can be tested at the present or planned experimental facilities . </S>"
