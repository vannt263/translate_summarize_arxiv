    "the first attempt to draw a link between classical thermodynamics and economics , due to samuelson @xcite , was based on the parallel between entropy maximization and utility or profit maximization . under this perspective",
    ", economic agents are treated like thermodynamic macroscopic subsystems composing a larger macroscopic system which is the market @xcite .",
    "this view , although consistent with the supposed optimizing behavior of economic agents , is at odds with the statistical physics microfoundation of thermodynamics , according to which macroscopic equilibrium arises from a purely random behavior of micro units .",
    "statistical physics introduces a clear separation of the microscopic and macroscopic levels which is lost in the proposed economic parallelism .",
    "a recent stream of literature employs the techniques of statistical mechanics under the hypothesis that in a limited period of time an economic system may behave as though in a quasi - equilibrium state @xcite . in these models we have homogeneous agents randomly exchanging money with a constraint on the total amount of money @xmath1 in the system .",
    "in particular in @xcite statistical ensembles describing economic systems with money ( cash ) and credit - debt are defined in an analytic way without resorting to numerical simulations .",
    "the homogeneity of economic agents is a consequence of the assumption of uniform ( in physical terms , isotropic ) random exchange , since the latter hypothesis makes agents symmetric with respect to the probability distribution of their monetary holdings .    in this paper",
    "we attempt to take a step forward by describing with the tools of statistical physics an economic system with heterogeneous agents .",
    "we resort to complex networks theory in order to introduce the key notion of market configuration . in @xcite",
    "the authors consider a set of network realizations ( ensemble ) and then impose constraints on the expectation value of a given set of graph observables @xmath2 with respect to the ensemble .",
    "this approach , as we see in the next section , lends itself to a very natural interpretation in terms of economic equilibrium . on the other hand",
    ", this is not the usual approach of statistical mechanics , where the constraint is imposed on the total hamiltonian of the system . in practice ,",
    "the ensemble introduced in @xcite is obtained , with the standard methods , only in the specific case @xmath3 , provided that the energy levels are appropriately chosen . by introducing a generic value of the temperature @xmath0 ,",
    "it is possible to regain the whole formalism of statistical mechanics , and consequently a consistent microfoundation of thermodynamic variables and relationships .",
    "it should be noticed that for a generic value of @xmath0 we have statistical but not economic equilibrium .",
    "the equality between the two is regained at @xmath3 ( or for some other fixed value @xmath4 , see note [ n5 ] ) , provided that the energy levels in the two hamiltonians are equal .",
    "hence the principal motivation of this paper is to define ensembles for complex networks with a sound interpretation of the typical network variables in terms of thermodynamics quantities together with a strong consistency with economic theory in general , and with walrasian general equilibrium theory in particular . in the literature",
    ", the important concept of graph temperature has been introduced for the first time in @xcite within a grand canonical ensemble . moreover , in @xcite the temperature of a complex network is studied in terms of the clustering properties of the graph .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in section 2",
    "we discuss the main ideas to build the ensembles of complex networks . in sections 3,4,5",
    "we build the ensembles . in section 6",
    "we apply our modeling to illustrate the role played by @xmath0 in terms of statistical uncertainty over market states . in section 7",
    "we further analyze the parallel between thermodynamic and economic equilibrium as addressed in the economic literature .",
    "section 8 is devoted to some conclusions .",
    "in microeconomic theory an exchange economy is a system of @xmath5 consumers , initially endowed with @xmath6 units of the available @xmath1 commodities and with preferences over alternative price - dependent consumption vectors @xmath7 , where @xmath8 ( the _ budget set _ ) is a set of affordable consumption vectors for @xmath9 , given @xmath6 and @xmath10 . in this economy",
    ", trade occurs whenever agents prefer a consumption vector @xmath11 .",
    "the excess demand function @xmath12 describes the trading plan of each agent .",
    "a _ walrasian _ equilibrium occurs when the market - clearing condition is satisfied for some price vector @xmath13 : @xmath14 and at the same time the consumption vector of each individual is the preferred one @xmath15 in her own budget set .",
    "the existence of the equilibrium price vector @xmath13 , which can be proved invoking katutani s fixed - point theorem , is regarded as a fundamental achievement of microeconomic theory @xcite .",
    "the notion of arrow - debreu equilibrium extends walrasian equilibrium by introducing the notions of states of the world @xmath16 and of contingent commodities , i.e. of commodities whose delivery is conditional on the realized state of the world . then an arrow - debreu equilibrium is simply a walrasian equilibrium in which the individual consumption vector @xmath17 is a @xmath18 vector . with this formulation , @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    "become dependent on @xmath21 . in fact , they are random variables distributed according to the discrete probability @xmath22 .",
    "the arrow - debreu equilibrium requires that each individual formulates a complete set of preferences over state - dependent consumption vectors @xmath23 .",
    "additionally , it requires that a market exists for each contingent commodity .",
    "these _ forward _ markets open before the uncertainty over the state of the world is resolved .",
    "once the latter is revealed , commodities are traded according to the corresponding equilibrium price and consumption vectors .",
    "there is no motivation to open a _ spot _",
    "market for re - trading , because forward markets achieve for some state @xmath21 exactly the same outcome that is achieved by a spot market opened when all participants know that the state of the world is @xmath21 . finding the arrow - debreu equilibrium price vector @xmath13 is thus equivalent to finding the state - dependent walrasian equilibrium price vector @xmath24 for each @xmath25 .    according to a well known result of microeconomic theory ,",
    "the requirement of a complete set of forward markets can be dropped .",
    "in fact , it is possible to show that the equilibrium achieved by trading on a forward market for a single commodity alongside with spot markets for all commodities ( the so - called radner equilibrium ) is equivalent to an arrow - debreu equilibrium under the condition that agents know the market - clearing prices for all commodities and under each state .",
    "surprising as it may be , a statistical representation of markets arises naturally from standard microeconomic theory . in order to illustrate this point",
    ", we need to introduce the notion of market configuration , defined as a sequence of nonnegative values @xmath26 describing the flow of a given commodity from @xmath9 to @xmath27 , which can be arranged in a nonnegative matrix @xmath28 . with this in mind , we introduce the following notations : @xmath29 is the final allocation for agent @xmath9 , and the excess demand is defined as follows @xmath30 thus we obtain that @xmath31 , where it is understood that @xmath32 stands for the fraction of the initial endowment which is not exchanged on the market . as we explain in sec . [",
    "sec : micro ] , a walrasian equilibrium corresponds to many distinct market configurations , which is natural to consider as random and equiprobable since economic agents are indifferent between them .",
    "this observation opens the door to a statistical representation of market configurations by means of the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "starting from this background , the transition to complex networks theory is very natural .",
    "in fact , the representation of markets outlined above is nothing different from the matrix representation of a network @xmath33 made of @xmath5 vertices .",
    "is a binary network , its links can take only binary values , and thus its matrix representation is given by the matrix @xmath34 with binary entries .",
    "for convenience , in this paper binary and weighted networks are labeled respectively fermionic and bosonic networks by analogy with the terminology of statistical physics . ]",
    "thanks to this parallelism , we can take advantage of previous contributions from the complex networks literature . in the paper @xcite ,",
    "the authors adapt the powerful tools of statistical mechanics to the study of random networks . in order to grasp the importance of this approach for our representation of markets , we need in the first place to distinguish between statistical equilibrium and economic equilibrium .",
    "indeed , statistical equilibrium in the sense of statistical physics , is a more general concept , meaning that we can define a time independent probability measure over market configurations @xmath35 .",
    "if the system is allowed to relax without external disturbances , it will converge to @xmath35 for @xmath36 , but the achievement of a walrasian equilibrium can not be taken for granted unless some additional arrangements are introduced .",
    "it is possible to show that , following the method of park and newman@xcite , we may obtain economic equilibrium as a consequence of statistical equilibrium .",
    "the rationale of their approach is straightforward , since they seek a systematic way to generate ensembles of random graphs displaying a set of desired average properties @xmath37 . in practice",
    ", they consider a set of graph configurations @xmath38 imposing the constraint that the expectation value of graph observables @xmath2 with respect to the ensemble probability distribution @xmath35 is equal to some arbitrary value @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath35 is obtained maximizing the gibbs entropy @xmath40 @xmath41 together with the observables and normalization constraints @xmath42 as a result , they obtain the distribution @xmath43 where @xmath44 are lagrange multipliers .",
    "the degree and strength distributions are the most common observables chosen as constraints for the problem ( [ p1])-([p2 ] ) . by strength of a node @xmath9 in a bosonic symmetric network",
    "we define the sum @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath28 is asymmetric , i.e. @xmath33 is directed , we need to distinguish between the out - strength @xmath46 and in - strength @xmath47 . the degree of a node @xmath9 , instead , is defined over the binary matrix @xmath34 representation of a fermionic network as the sum @xmath48 . if @xmath34 is asymmetric , again we need to distinguish between the out - degree and in - degree of the node @xmath9 .",
    "park and newman provide a solution of the problem ( [ p1])-([p2 ] ) when the constraints are represented either by the degree or by the strength distributions .",
    "they took into account the following hamiltonian for a fermionic undirected network with fixed expected degree distribution : @xmath49 using the definition of @xmath50 eq .",
    "( [ pp1 ] ) may be rewritten as follows @xmath51 where @xmath52 . for a bosonic network",
    "they obtain instead @xmath53 starting from the expressions ( [ p8])-([p9 ] ) , they derive the analogue of the quantum fermi - dirac and bose - einstein distributions respectively for @xmath54 and @xmath55 . by inspection",
    "it is easy we see that the @xmath56 and @xmath57 are indeed equivalent to the occupation numbers included in the hamiltonian of the fermi and bose ideal gases respectively , while the @xmath58 are equivalent to the energy levels occurring in the same hamiltonian .",
    "this equivalence justifies the interpretation , made by the authors , according to which links are the equivalent of particles in network ensembles . in economic terms , links / particles are commodity units while the energies @xmath58 are very naturally interpreted as shadow prices @xcite .",
    "furthermore , given our previous market representation , in the bosonic directed case it is possible to make the straightforward identifications : @xmath59    these identifications make sense only if @xmath60 and @xmath61 have negligible fluctuations around their ensemble averages .",
    "in fact , the problem ( [ p1])-([p2 ] ) is related to the derivation of the canonical ensemble in statistical physics , which requires that fluctuations of constrained observables are small . from our arguments",
    "above , we see that this is not necessarily the case for arrow - debreu equilibria , since @xmath22 is arbitrary . on the other hand",
    ", microeconomic theory makes the unrealistic assumption that we have a complete knowledge of the world , represented by the finiteness of the set of states .",
    "if we suppose instead that there is a numerable infinite set of states , we can compute @xmath62 and @xmath24 for at most a finite sample of states @xmath40 .",
    "but then the equivalence between forward markets and spot markets , which is essential for microeconomic theory , comes to depend critically on the shape of @xmath22 .",
    "only if the latter is sharply peaked around the most likely state @xmath63 , this equivalence may be reformulated in the following form : @xmath64 where @xmath21 is the realized state .",
    "when this condition is fulfilled , we say that the market is in a _",
    "statistical _ walrasian equilibrium .",
    "we label this equilibrium as walrasian because agents uncertainty regarding the final allocation is strongly limited under our assumptions , and the computation of @xmath13 is necessary in order to achieve the equilibrium itself .",
    "the conditions above are satisfied as soon as we choose the following constraints for the problem ( [ p1])-([p2 ] ) : @xmath65 in fact , we know from statistical physics that the fluctuations around the expected values are small in the resulting network ensemble for large @xmath66 . with this choice",
    "we justify the previous claim that economic equilibrium can be obtained from statistical equilibrium in the bosonic directed model under appropriate conditions .",
    "we should note two fundamental differences of the distribution ( [ p3 ] ) with respect to the usual boltzmann - gibbs distribution . in the first place ,",
    "the former is coincident with the latter only for @xmath3 .",
    "since @xmath0 is related to the energy constraint , we see that @xmath67 is not explicitly conserved in the network ensemble , but its conservation is a consequence of the constraints over observables .",
    "thus , it easy to see that if we allow @xmath0 to vary we can not comply anymore with the constraints of the model for some @xmath4 . in this case",
    "the constraints are satisfied only for @xmath68.[n5 ] ] .    in the following sections",
    ", we build the fermionic and bosonic network ensembles along standard lines @xcite , thereby recovering the factor @xmath69 of statistical physics . in order to do so",
    ", we introduce the generic energy levels @xmath70 together with the hamiltonian @xmath71 of course , it is always possible to specify the energy levels in such a way as to verify the constraints ( [ p10])-([p7 ] ) for @xmath72 or some other fixed value ( see note [ n5 ] ) . in this particular case ,",
    "our conditions for statistical walrasian equilibrium are regained under the more general model .",
    "this possibility suggests that @xmath0 could be interpreted in this context as a quantification of economic disequilibrium , which can indeed coexist with statistical equilibrium .",
    "in other terms , statistical equilibrium should be interpreted as the outcome of a relaxation process which not necessarily leads the system to economic equilibrium .    for the derivations of the following sections , we propose to identify the equivalent of the volume @xmath73 of physical systems for networks with the degrees of freedom of the network .",
    "these are given by the number of points of the bidimensional lattice formed by the couples of nodes @xmath74 , i.e. @xmath75 . for example , for directed graphs we have @xmath76 , for undirected ones @xmath77 while for graphs with selfloops @xmath78 .",
    "moreover , according with the usual interpretation ( see @xcite ) , the number of links , that we denote from now on with @xmath79 , is the formal analogue of the number particles in the usual physical systems . in the economic interpretation ,",
    "the fluctuations of @xmath79 , introduced with the grandcanonical ensemble , are a consequence of uncertainty over the available commodities under different states of the world , since @xmath80 . with this assumptions and ideas in mind ,",
    "in the next three sections we derive the statistical ensembles .",
    "let s suppose that agents are certain about the state of the world @xmath81 , i.e. @xmath82 . then , provided they know the market clearing price @xmath13 , they are free to choose their optimal consumption @xmath83 and the market will display with certainty an `` energy '' level @xmath84 . here",
    "the @xmath85 , @xmath86 are nothing more than multipliers for the following constraints : @xmath87 in general there are many market configurations which are consistent with these constraints . since agents have no reason to prefer one of this states over the other , the latter can be considered as equally likely . in this way",
    "we obtain the microcanonical ensemble , i.e. the set of market configurations which are consistent with walrasian equilibrium . + the starting point to build the microcanonical ensemble is the hamiltonian ( [ p5 ] ) micro - variables @xmath88 . in the most general form",
    "we have @xmath89 with @xmath90 . ] with @xmath91 . in this ensemble ,",
    "the `` energy '' @xmath92 is conserved and the number of links or commodity units @xmath79 and of agents @xmath5 are fixed too . by considering these constraints , as usual",
    ", we can define @xmath93 as the total number of configurations , at fixed @xmath75 and @xmath79 , calculated at the surface @xmath94 of constant energy . in this context",
    ", the entropy @xmath40 can be defined in the usual way : @xmath95 the following thermodynamical relations hold : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the pressure definition in the network context .",
    "furthermore , we define the analogue of the free helmholtz energy @xmath98 : @xmath99 from ( [ kgp8 ] ) and ( [ kgp9 ] ) we get : @xmath100 equation ( [ p12 ] ) is the analogue of the first thermodynamic principle for complex networks .",
    "finally , from ( [ kgb ] ) and ( [ p12 ] ) we have : @xmath101",
    "now let s suppose that the probability distribution of states is peaked around a given state @xmath81 and that @xmath83 , @xmath20 and @xmath13 are continuous in @xmath21 . in this case the conditions for a statistical walrasian equilibrium , specified in sec .",
    "[ sec : prel ] , are fulfilled .",
    "agents trade according to the observed @xmath102 , but the probability of observing large deviations from walrasian equilibrium , as defined by the microcanonical ensemble , is small .    inspired by this economic view",
    ", the derivation of the canonical ensemble follows the lines present in @xcite , whereby we follow as closely as possible the standard derivation of the gibbs distribution in statistical mechanics . as a first step we introduce @xmath103 and @xmath104 as sub - networks of an isolated network @xmath33 of fixed energy @xmath105 with @xmath106 .",
    "then we assume that @xmath107 , which means that the states @xmath74 , defined between couples of nodes @xmath108 belonging respectively to @xmath103 and @xmath104 , are empty , i.e. that links or commodity units can not flow from one subnetwork to the other .",
    "thus the two systems can be treated as mutually independent . under the assumption that @xmath105 is conserved , we have @xmath109 as usual , by performing a taylor expansion with @xmath110 , since we are interested in the behavior of the subsystem @xmath111 independently from the reservoir @xmath112 we can write , after using ( [ cqrt ] ) and ( [ kgp9 ] ) , @xmath113 following the usual derivation in statistical mechanics we can write the partition function @xmath114 as stated above , differently from ( [ p3 ] ) , the standard factor @xmath115 appears in ( [ c3])-([c4 ] ) .",
    "the two distributions coincide for @xmath3 provided that the energy levels in the two hamiltonians are identical .",
    "since the park and newman distribution is a special case of the standard gibbs distribution , the grand canonical extension may be accomplished along the standard lines . ] .",
    "here it is essential to stress again that the number @xmath5 is related to the volume of the network , i.e. @xmath116 is the equivalent of the volume @xmath73 of physical systems .",
    "we suppose that @xmath103 and @xmath104 are components of a larger system @xmath33 characterized by the gibbs distribution ( [ c3 ] ) , but now links are allowed to `` move '' between the two volumes @xmath117 and @xmath118 . + the partition function @xmath119 of @xmath33 is @xmath120 also in this case , by following the derivation of the grand canonical partition function of the standard statistical mechanics @xcite ( remember that in our case @xmath79 plays the role of particle numbers @xmath5 in a ordinary gas ) , by the help of ( [ c3 ] ) and ( [ c4 ] ) after posing @xmath121 , @xmath122 and introducing the fugacity @xmath123 , after a taylor expansion , we obtain the grand canonical partition function : @xmath124 where the subscript 1 has been dropped in ( [ rest ] ) .",

    "in fact , by the influence of some external economic input , the agents can change strategy or `` behaviour '' and thus they can change the energy distributions @xmath70 by reaching another equilibrium state with a different @xmath0 .",
    "note that this generally can be accomplished out of a walrasian equilibrium .",
    "however , we may think also to a change of the energy levels in such a way that the system evolves through states of walrasian equilibrium . in practice ,",
    "a mismatch between economic and statistical equilibrium can arise when a market is subject to an unexpected external shock , that in our formalism is described by a variation of @xmath0 which is not compensated by an adjustment of the energy levels .",
    "we may think instead that under an external shock , the latter are generally very different from the starting ones .",
    "but , if the flow of external shocks is fast enough to prevent the relaxation of the system or the adjustment of expectations , economic equilibrium becomes impossible .",
    "conversely , for a very short relaxation time , economic equilibrium can be reached .",
    "the reasonings above show that our formalism allows to explore in a sound way the meaning of all the relevant thermodynamical transformations .",
    "samuelson @xcite expressed the view that no more than a formal mathematical analogy exists between classical thermodynamics and utility theory .",
    "this analogy is grounded in the mathematical tool of constrained optimization , which is applied respectively to entropy and to the individual utility function .",
    "more recently , smith and foley have elaborated further on this parallel @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare their approach with the one we present in this paper . from a methodological point of view",
    ", they are quite different : smith and foley leverage on the parallel between utility and entropy , and consequently try to mutually adapt neoclassical utility theory and classical thermodynamics ; we leverage instead on the indeterminacy of walrasian equilibrium with respect to market configurations in order to bring statistical physics and thermodynamics into general equilibrium theory , without any explicit reference to utility .",
    "the main motivation for smith and foley to push the parallel between utility and entropy is to lend support to a decentralized process of price discovery , which can be contrasted with walrasian tntonnement @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", we use walrasian equilibrium as a starting point to introduce all thermodynamic quantities , including entropy , with a clear microfoundation in terms of market configurations .",
    "smith and foley explicitly choose to neglect the separation between micro and macro by treating economic agents in an exchange economy as thermodynamic macroscopic systems .",
    "in particular , they draw a parallel between the process of discovering market - clearing prices in such economy and the partial equilibration of a collection of thermodynamic systems .",
    "the mental experiment they propose , in its simplest form , is the following : two isolated thermodynamic systems with different extensive and intensive variables are brought into contact in such a way that they are thermodynamically closed one with respect to the other .",
    "then the system formed by the two subsystems will equilibrate up to a unique value of the intensive variables ( temperature and pressure ) while , if the systems are of different chemical nature , the extensive variables will generally be different . in the economic interpretation ,",
    "relative prices represent the intensive variables , and the individual consumption vectors represent the extensive variables of the two subsystems .",
    "while thermodynamic equilibrium is obtained by maximizing entropy @xmath192 as a function of the extensive variables , economic equilibrium is obtained by maximizing @xmath193 as a function of the vector of available commodities @xmath194 .",
    "their parallel between entropy and utility runs into severe difficulties . in the first place ,",
    "the value of entropy for a macroscopic system at equilibrium is a state function of the system itself , with a well defined value .",
    "this is not true for economic systems , because the maximum of @xmath193 is degenerate unless we suppose that agents exchange commodities at the market clearing prices . in this case",
    "we obtain a walrasian equilibrium , which becomes unique under some additional conditions .",
    "but walrasian equilibrium in this context is at odds with thermodynamics since if the intensive variables ( relative prices ) are already equal , no change in the values of extensive variables ( and thus no market exchange ) is possible from a thermodynamic perspective . in the second place , the idea that economic agents are thermodynamic systems implies that each agent can maximize her own utility in isolation , something which is completely at odds with utility theory . in the third place ,",
    "entropy is additive , while utility has the same property only under restrictive assumptions ( quasi - linear utility functions ) . in the fourth place , economic equilibration in the neoclassical theory",
    "is subject to the voluntary exchange principle , which implies the additional constraint that individual utilities can never decrease .",
    "this constraint prescribes that no individual agent will end up with a consumption vector which is smaller than the endowment vector , while this is a perfectly possible outcome in thermodynamics .",
    "last but not least , the notion of system in thermodynamics is intentionally undetermined , since systems may be not only be brought into contact but mixed to form a new larger system whose original components can not be distinguished anymore .",
    "but this is at odds with the very nature of economic agents .",
    "in this paper we have extend the approach started in @xcite and developed in @xcite in order to define in a comprehensive way the thermodynamics of complex networks .",
    "furthermore , we have provided a clear economic interpretation of our results , showing that statistical equilibrium can be defined also for systems which are not in economic equilibrium . in this context , the temperature @xmath0 for a given network can be seen as a measure of the departure from economic equilibrium .    in the same way of physics",
    ", the relevance of statistical equilibrium for networks must be traced back to the dynamics of relaxation . concerning the exchange economy introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : prel ] , the relaxation process can be represented as follows . at @xmath195",
    "the market configuration is specified by @xmath196 . if we suppose that all agents know each other s excess demand , then it is rational for each agent @xmath9 to choose for her transactions the counterpart @xmath27 which minimizes @xmath197 .",
    "then the quantity @xmath198 is exchanged .",
    "when @xmath199 is minimized , there is no more incentive to trade and the system is in a rest state . in order to obtain economic equilibrium ,",
    "the system must achieve @xmath200 . in both cases ,",
    "the system is driven towards a stable state which is the one described in the previous sections .    as an application ,",
    "we have considered different simple expressions for the `` energies '' @xmath58 . in particular , we have considered the simple cases with constant and gaussian distributed @xmath58 , and studied the ensemble probability of a given graph in terms of the temperature @xmath0 .",
    "what we obtain is that the number of graphs with a given probability seems to be practically insensitive to the choice made for @xmath58 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it should be stressed that our approach differs from the most common parallelism between utility theory and thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "in fact , we do not identify the utility function with entropy and maintain instead the fundamental distinction between micro and macro .",
    "conversely , we start from general equilibrium theory by introducing the equiprobable walrasian equilibrium states as the building blocks of a statistical representation of market configurations .",
    "this provides a natural link with complex networks , and in particular a clear connection between graph and thermodynamic variables which preserves the core of microeconomic theory .",
