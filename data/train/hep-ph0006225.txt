    "recently the cleo collaboration has reported measurements on the branching ratios of rare hadronic b decays @xmath7@xcite .",
    "the data have attracted great interest from both theorists and experimentalists .",
    "the study of these channels will provide us important insights on understanding the effects of electroweak penguins ( ewp ) in b - system@xcite , and the final state interactions(fsi)@xcite , as well as extracting the weak ckm phase @xmath8@xcite .",
    "it may also open a window for probing new physics@xcite . from the current data",
    ", it is noticed that the branching ratio for @xmath9 is relatively small , @xmath10 ( in units of @xmath11 ) .",
    "the decays for @xmath12 have almost equal decay rates , i.e. , @xmath13 . while an unexpectedly large branching ratio for @xmath14 decay was also observed , @xmath15 .",
    "these measurements seem in conflict with the calculations based on the naive factorization hypotheses . for the first three decays ,",
    "it was pointed out that the factorization approach may still be valid if one takes the weak phase @xmath16 to be greater than @xmath17@xcite .",
    "with such a large @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath18 , the interference between tree and penguin diagrams has opposite sign in @xmath0 and @xmath19 decays .",
    "thus the negative @xmath20 will suppress the decay rate for @xmath21 and enhance that for @xmath22 . as a consequence ,",
    "the almost equal decay rates for @xmath23 and @xmath24 decay modes indicate the dominance of strong penguin . however , the large rate for @xmath25 is not easily explained .",
    "most recent analysis showed that a large final state interaction ( fsi ) phase would be helpful to enhance the branching ratio for the @xmath25 decay@xcite , but only considering the elastic - rescatterings remains insufficient to obtain the large central value of the data .    to understand the measured data , besides some model - dependent calculations , a model - independent approach using a single relative strong phase has also been proposed for the study of @xmath26 decays@xcite . since the ordinary factorization approach suffers from the uncertainties due to hadronic matrix elements , such as the meson decay constants , b - meson form factors and so - called effective color number @xmath27 .",
    "the model - independent analyses may be more useful as more data become available .",
    "the approach based on the isospin @xmath28 and approximate flavor @xmath29@xcite symmetries of the strong interactions has been proposed to constrain @xcite and extract the weak phase @xmath16@xcite .",
    "it has been noticed that the ratios between the cp - averaged decay rates , such as @xmath30 may provide us important information on the weak phase @xmath16 .",
    "most recently , it has been shown that the weak phase @xmath16 may be determined through three ratios among cp - averaged decay rates of @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 decays@xcite . where two solutions were obtained at the @xmath5 level , one with positive @xmath35 and negative @xmath20 , i.e. , relative small strong phase @xmath36 and large weak phase @xmath16 , and another with negative @xmath35 and positive @xmath20 .",
    "the latter with positive @xmath20 seems to be favored by solutions obtained from other constraints in the standard model but appears not to be as favorable as the one with negative @xmath20 studies of all the existing charmless decays are taken in account .",
    "however , there is still no complete analysis in the literature .    in this paper",
    ", we shall give a general analysis for all 7 decay modes of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "for that purpose , we will start from a general model independent parameterization for all the decay amplitudes by considering both the isospin and simple diagrammatic decompositions .",
    "we will show that there are in general 15 independent variables . by assuming the su(3 )",
    "relations which appropriately account for su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects , it allows us to reduce the 15 independent variables into 9 .",
    "they consist of 6 isospin amplitudes and 2 relative strong phase as well as one weak phase @xmath16 .",
    "note that once the relative strong phase is zero , @xmath37 only receives contributions from penguin - type diagram and the amplitudes of the isospin @xmath38 and @xmath39 amplitudes from tree - type diagrams cancel each other , which provides an additional constraint@xcite .",
    "in fact , one of the isospin amplitudes becomes almost irrelevant due to the suppression factor of the ckm mixing element .",
    "with such a consideration , there are only 8 relevant unknown quantities with 5 isospin amplitudes and 3 phases .",
    "we show that the current 6 measured decay rates allow us to extract 6 unknown quantities as functions of two variable .",
    "the upper bound of the decay rate @xmath40 also provides a bound for the difference between the two strong phases . once taking the numerical value of the weak phase @xmath16 to be the one obtained from other constraints in the standard model and fixing one of the strong phases ,",
    "all the other parameters can be determined . with these determined parameters , we are then able to predict the branching ratio of the @xmath6 decay mode which is yet unmeasured due to the difficulty of its identification by the current detector .",
    "in addition we also present predictions for direct cp violations in all 7 decay channels of @xmath41 . in our numerical fitting ,",
    "we have adopted the @xmath2 analysis for the cleo data in order to have a systematic treatment on the experimental errors .    in general , according to the watson theorem , there are two independent relative strong phases associating with the isospin amplitudes .",
    "they are often assumed to be equal in the literatures@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we shall make a more general analysis with two relative strong phases .",
    "it is shown that the equal phase assumption will result in large enhancement of isospin amplitude @xmath42 which will be 5 times larger than the one calculated from the factorization approach .",
    "the value of the strong phase is found to be @xmath43 .",
    "these large values may imply large inelastic fsi or indicate the possible new physics effects",
    ". however , if the two strong phases are different , the value of @xmath42 can be lower and is comparable with the usual factorization calculations .",
    "it is remarkable to observe that within @xmath5 all the 6 decay rates can be consistently fitted for a large range of the weak phase @xmath44 for the above two cases .",
    "it is also of interest to note that one of isospin amplitudes and the strong phases have a weak dependence on the weak phase @xmath16 .",
    "three isospin amplitudes show a moderate dependence on the weak phase @xmath16 .",
    "only one isospin amplitude is sensitive to @xmath16 . in particular ,",
    "the fitting values for the 4 usual isospin amplitudes considered in most of the literature could still be comparable with the ones obtained by using naive factorization approach .",
    "the resulting large strong phases may be regarded as a strong indication of large fsi in @xmath7 decays .",
    "we begin with writing the decay amplitude of @xmath26 in the following general form : a^(k)= ^d(s)_u a^(k)_u+^d(s)_c a^(k)_c , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the products of ckm matrix elements .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath47 has been absorbed into the above two terms by using the unitarity relation , @xmath48 .",
    "we also find it useful to adopt the isospin decomposition for the decay amplitudes a^u , c_^-^+&= & + [ su2 - 1 ] + a^u , c_^0 ^ 0&= & - + a^u , c_^-^0&=&- + a^u , c_^+k^-&= & + + a^u , c_^0|k^0&= & - + a^u , c_^0k^-&=&- - a^u , c_^-|k^0 [ su2 - 6 ] with @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the isospin amplitudes and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the strong phases due to final state interactions . in some literatures",
    "the strong phase of isospin amplitude @xmath54 is assumed to be equal to the one of @xmath55 for simplicity@xcite .",
    "however , in the most general case , these strong phases are not necessarily the same , since they arise from the effective hamiltonian with different isospin .",
    "the subscript @xmath56 denote the isospins of the amplitudes .",
    "the advantage of the isospin decomposition allows one to use @xmath29 relations including leading order @xmath29 breaking effects . in other words ,",
    "the isospin amplitudes are assumed to satisfy the following relations : a^u , c_0&&(f_/f_k ) a^u , c_1/2 ,  a^u , c_2(f_/f_k ) a^u , c_3/2 + _ 0&&_1/2 ,   _ 2 _ 3/2 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the @xmath59 meson decay constants with @xmath60 . for convenience , we define two phase differences as follows : & = & _ 3/2-_1/2 +  & = & _1/2-_1/2    practically , the decay amplitudes are evaluated by calculating various feynman diagrams . in order to see how those isospin amplitudes receive contributions from diagrams , we also present a simple diagrammatic decomposition .",
    "the diagrams can in general be classified into 6 types denoted by @xmath61(tree ) , @xmath62(color suppressed tree ) @xmath63(qcd penguin ) , @xmath64(electroweak penguin ) and @xmath65 ( color suppressed electroweak penguin ) @xcite : a_^-^+ & = & t+p+23p^c_ew + a_^0 ^ 0 & = & ( -c+p - p_ew-13p^c_ew ) + a_^-^0 & = & ( -t - c - p_ew - p^c_ew ) + a_^+k^- & = & t+p+23p^c_ew + a_^0|k^0 & = & ( -c+p-p_ew - p^c_ew ) where the primed and unprimed quantities are the amplitudes in @xmath66 and @xmath67 decays .",
    "they roughly differ by a factor @xmath60 when the @xmath29 flavor symmetry breaking effects are considered .    combining the two decompositions",
    ", it is straight forward to get the following relations : & = & 2t-c+3p-p_ew+p^c_ew^u , c  , + & = & t+c+p_ew+p^c_ew ^u , c [ a2c ]  . from the above equations ,",
    "one may easily see the relative magnitudes among those @xmath28 invariant amplitudes .",
    "if the inelastic rescattering effects are small , @xmath68 will only contribute to the term proportional to @xmath69 .",
    "therefore one may expect that @xmath70 .",
    "this will lead to @xmath71 .",
    "since @xmath72 receives contributions from qcd penguins , while @xmath42 only gets contributions from ewps , one may conclude that @xmath73 .    to obtain relations for the isospin amplitude @xmath54",
    ", one needs to be careful in adopting the diagrammatic decomposition implied by the naive factorization ansatz .",
    "this is because the resulting relative strong phase is zero in the factorization approach , i.e. , @xmath74 and @xmath75 . as a consequence , @xmath76",
    "the amplitudes with isospin @xmath38 and @xmath39 from tree - type graphs cancel each other in eq.([penguin ] ) .",
    "thus the total amplitude only receives contributions from penguin diagrams in this case , namely @xmath77    if assuming the @xmath78-quark dominance in the penguin loops , one finds from eq.([b1/2 ] ) that : a^u_^-|k^0 a^c_^-|k^0 or b^u_1/2b^c_1/2 + a^u_3/2 - a^c_3/2 .",
    "[ approx ] which may be assumed for simplicity to be approximately valid after considering final state interactions with nonzero strong phases . in the numerical calculations ,",
    "we have check that the amplitude @xmath79 is less important due to the strong suppression of the ckm factor ( for instance , even if taking @xmath80 , the results remain almost unchanged ) .    with the above analyses ,",
    "let us provide an intuitive discussion on how to yield a large branching ratio for @xmath14 decay by appropriately choosing the isospin amplitudes .",
    "note the fact that @xmath81 , one may roughly estimate the ratio between @xmath82 and @xmath83 by neglecting the terms containing the ckm factor @xmath69 r= & & ^2 , [ r ] with @xmath84 .",
    "once neglecting @xmath42 , the ratio may be simply given by @xmath85 , which is much smaller than the central value of the data @xmath86 .",
    "it indicates that to enhance the decay rate of @xmath87 , the isospin amplitude @xmath42 should not be neglected .",
    "its small value may provide a sizable contribution for a large value of @xmath88 .",
    "this is because in this case there exists a constructive interference between @xmath72 and @xmath42 in @xmath87 and a destructive interference in @xmath23 .",
    "the situation is quite similar to the case for a large @xmath89 , which is considered to enhance @xmath90 and decrease @xmath0 decay rates . from eq.([r ] ) , it is easily seen that the value of @xmath42 satisfies a^c_3/2 a^c_1/2 0.12  a^c_1/2 .    with the above considerations , there are only 8 relevant quantities : @xmath91 , which should be constrained by six measured decay rates and one upper bound .",
    "when taking the weak phase @xmath16 as a free parameter , the rest 6 variables can be determined from 6 equations of eqs.([su2 - 1]-[su2 - 6 ] ) .",
    "as the errors in the current data remain considerable large , one may not take the central values of the data to be too serious .",
    "thus by only using the central values of the data to determine the 6 variables may not be good enough . to take into account the experimental errors in a systematic way",
    ", we shall adopt a global @xmath2 ( least square ) analysis for the present data .",
    "this treatment allows us to obtain not only the central value but also the errors for the fitting amplitudes .",
    "our fitting will be carried out by using the standard @xmath2 analysis program package minuit@xcite .",
    "in order to compare with the values estimated from the factorization , it is necessary to explicitly see how large of the isospin amplitudes @xmath92 and @xmath93 from the factorization calculations , we present the relevant formulae for the @xmath7 decay amplitudes with the assumption of factorization@xcite : a_^+k^-&=&^s_u a_1-^s_t(a_4+a_10+(a_6+a_8)r_4 ) + a_^0|k^0&=&-^s_t a_4+a_6r_5-(a_10+a_8r_5 ) + & & -^s_u a_2-^s_t ( a_9-a_7 ) + a_^0k^-&=&-^s_u a_1- ^s_t(a_4+a_6r_4+(a_10+a_8r_4 ) + & & -^s_u a_2-^s_t ( a_9-a_7 ) + a_^-|k^0^c & = & -^s_t a_4+a_6r_5-(a_10+a_8r_5 ) where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the decay constants and @xmath96-meson form factors respectively , @xmath97 and @xmath98 . in the flavor @xmath28 limit , one has @xmath99 .",

    ", it may be used to extract the angle @xmath16 once one of those amplitudes can be determined or calculated in other independent ways .",
    "it is of interest to see that the @xmath16 dependence of the amplitude @xmath115 and the strong phase @xmath36 is weak , which shows that these two quantities are approximately fixed .",
    "the possibility of large @xmath36 was also suggested in ref.@xcite to explain the large branching ratio of the @xmath25 decay .",

    "therefore , the results of estimates based on the naive factorization approach should be unreliable , and the isospin amplitudes must receive additional large contributions .",
    "a large value for the relative strong phase @xmath121 implies that the final state interactions or inelastic rescattering effects must be significant .",
    "we would like to stress that the most outstanding feature of the @xmath2 analysis with @xmath75 is that the isospin amplitude @xmath42 is likely to be relatively larger than the one estimated from the naive factorization calculations .",
    "the fitting central value of @xmath42 may be larger by a factor of @xmath122 . to explicitly see how the decay rates depend on the isospin amplitude @xmath42 , we plot in fig.[a2c.eps ] the 6 branching ratios of @xmath7 decays as functions of @xmath42 .",
    "it can be clearly seen that if @xmath75 , a small value of @xmath123 is not able to reproduce all the cleo data within the @xmath5 level , especially the data for the channels of @xmath124 and @xmath125 . to consistently describe the whole data , we need a relative large value @xmath126 for fitting the central value of the data which is about @xmath127 of the largest one @xmath128 .    within the standard model",
    ", it seems difficult to enhance the isospin amplitude @xmath42 by an order of magnitude even the inelastic fsi is involved , this is because the main inelastic channels such as @xmath129 , only contribute to isospin-@xmath130 part of the decay amplitude . in the sm , it is known that the ratio @xmath131 can be determined without the hadronic uncertainties in the flavor @xmath29 limit , this is because the ratio only depends on the short distance wilson coefficients@xcite .",
    "thus a large value of @xmath131 may indicate the existence of new physics . while all models beyond the standard model must effectively provide large contributions to the electroweak penguins in order to enhance the isospin amplitude @xmath42 , such models are : susy with r parity violation , @xmath132-model and @xmath133-mediated fcnc models , et .",
    "let us now consider the case that @xmath109 is non - zero , the situation then becomes quite different . in fig.[iso30.eps ] and fig.[iso60.eps ] , it is seen that @xmath42 decreases as the value of @xmath109 increases .",

    ", the values of @xmath109 can not be too large due to the constraint of the upper bound of the branching ratio of @xmath136 .",

    "there remains an unobserved decay mode in @xmath7 decays , which is the decay mode @xmath6 ( the cleo collaboration has already reported the indication of @xmath149 ) .",
    "as all the relevant isospin amplitudes have been determined as functions of @xmath16 , it allows us to predict @xmath6 as a function of @xmath16 .",
    "it is interesting to note that our @xmath2-analysis shows that the resulting branching ratio @xmath150 is almost independent of the weak phase @xmath16 .",

    "such a large branching ratio is about an order of magnitude larger than the prediction based on factorization calculations .",

    "in summary , we have made a general less model - dependent investigation on the charmless b - meson decays by using the @xmath2 analysis based on the most recent cleo data .",
    "we have used the most general isospin decomposition with two independent strong phases .",
    "all the isospin amplitudes in rare hadronic @xmath96 decays @xmath7 can be determined as functions of the weak phase @xmath16 and one strong phase @xmath109 .",
    "the effects of two equal and unequal strong phases are studied in detail .",
    "it is found that the isospin amplitude @xmath115 and the strong phase @xmath36 only slightly depend on the phase @xmath16 .",
    "an important observation under the equal strong phase assumption is the relative large isospin amplitude @xmath42 , @xmath156 where the central value is about 5 times greater than the one obtained from the factorization calculations .",
    "when the two strong phases are not equal , the allowed values of @xmath42 decrease as their difference , i.e. , @xmath109 , increases . for the most general case with two rather than one large fsi strong phases , the magnitude of all the isospin amplitudes may be around the one estimated from the factorization approach",

    "<S> -1 cm    we present a general analysis on charmless b - meson decays @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is noticed that the final state interactions and inelastic rescattering effects must be significant in order to understand the consistency of the current data . by using general isospin decompositions , the isospin amplitudes and the corresponding strong phases </S>",
    "<S> could be extracted from a global @xmath2 fit of the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that in general there are two , rather than one , relative strong phases in the decomposition . in the assumption of two equalstrong phases as considered in the literature , the current data , especially the ones concerning @xmath3decays , will imply a large isospin amplitude @xmath4 , which is larger by a factor of five than the one from the naive factorization estimation . </S>",
    "<S> when two different strong phases are considered , all the isospin amplitudes can become , within the @xmath5-level , comparable with the theoretical values . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the difference between the two strong phases can not be too large and will be restricted by the most recent upper bound of @xmath6 decay . in any case , the strong phases are found to be large and the branching ratio of @xmath6 is likely to be enhanced by an order of magnitude in comparison with the one obtained from the naive factorization approach . </S>",
    "<S> direct cp violations in all decay modes are also calculated and found to be close to the sensitivity of the present experiments .    </S>",
