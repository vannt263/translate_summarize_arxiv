    "a periodic crystal in the absence of disorder supports extended bloch waves within the bounds of energy bands  @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of the electronic states in a strongly disordered ( i.e. amorphous ) material where symmetry with respect to discrete translations is absent , is a more subtle question .",
    "our aim is to examine the effect of very strong disorder on transport characteristics .",
    "operating in the framework of a tight binding model where electrons are localized in atomic sites or dopant impurities , we examine amorphous materials in one , two , and three dimensions where the locations of atoms are taken to be uncorrelated and randomly distributed within the medium .",
    "atomic or dopant configurations with no local ordering of the sites are described as gas - like disorder  @xcite with relevance to the transport characteristics associated with expanded alkali metals  @xcite as well as impurity bands in silicon .",
    "the characteristics of exciton states with respect to localization have been examined in the context of similar types of disorder  @xcite . in broader generality ,",
    "formal analytical and computer studies have calculated the density of states in amorphous materials with no correlations among the site positions  @xcite    disorder , even in regular lattices , may be manifest as random site energies which can disrupt the extended character of itinerant states and thereby create conditions for localization .",
    "our aim is to examine strongly disordered materials and the properties of the associated electronic states with respect to localization .",
    "however , we do not introduce a random site energy , and in this sense our work is complementary to studies where random potentials are superimposed on sites in a periodic crystalline geometry  @xcite . instead of examining a system on a regular lattice geometry ,",
    "we calculate electronic wave functions for the fully amorphous case and examine how strong positional disorder , in conjunction with tunneling matrix elements which decay exponentially in the separation of neighboring hopping sites , affects the characteristics of eigenstates with respect to localization .",
    "off - diagonal disorder which enters in random variations in tunneling matrix elements controlling hopping among sites in the absence of a random on - site potential , has been of interest since an early study by f.  j. dyson  @xcite .",
    "calculations related to the density of states  @xcite and aspects of localization  @xcite have been carried out in the context of a 3d gas - like tight binding model .",
    "we report on results relevant to the aim of finding out by direct calculation in a large - scale statistical study the extent to which wave functions are localized in amorphous materials and under what conditions eigenstates are extended .",
    "moreover , we obtain phase portraits showing for different energies and ranges @xmath0 of the hopping integral domains of extended and localized states .    in this work ,",
    "we use for the tight binding hamiltonian @xmath2 where the sum over the index `` @xmath3 '' ranges over the @xmath4 particles contained in the simulation volume , we take the hopping parameter @xmath5 to be 3.0 electron volts , and the factor of `` 1/2 '' compensates for multiple counting of the hopping terms between atoms .",
    "the creation and destruction operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 create and destroy occupied electronic orbitals at sites indicated by the subscript . for the hopping integral , we use @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the separation between sites @xmath3 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the typical inter - orbital separation , @xmath12 is the volume density of sites , @xmath13 is the dimensionality of the system , and @xmath14 is a dimensionless parameter . with the hopping integrals expressed in this manner and the length scale for the decay of the hopping matrix element thus being @xmath15",
    ", large / small @xmath14 values correspond to decay lengths small / large in relation to the typical interatomic separation . for the sake of convenience ,",
    "we rescale coordinates such that @xmath16 , with a simple inverse relationship @xmath17 among the hopping length scale @xmath0 and decay parameter @xmath14 and @xmath18 for the dependence of the tunneling matrix element .",
    "although the hopping integral @xmath19 is finite in range by virtue of the exponential decay , we nevertheless take into consideration hopping among all pairs of orbitals contained in the system of @xmath4 sites with only a negligible increase ( i.e. a contribution on the order of @xmath20 ) where direct diagonalization , which scales as @xmath21 and constitutes the main computational bottleneck , is used to calculate the electronic states .",
    "our hamiltonian does not incorporate perturbations of the on - site energy term ( for convenience all site energies are set to zero ) , and disorder instead enters in the off - diagonal tunneling matrix elements .",
    "thus , our program in this work is to investigate the effect of positional disorder itself on transport characteristics . although the treatment is nonperturbative with no local order in the locations of the sites in the amorphous systems we examine , the decay length scale @xmath0 of the hopping integral serves to parameterize the disorder strength . for large @xmath0 ( small @xmath14 )",
    ", the tunneling is long - ranged and connects sites to many neighbors , effectively averaging over the hopping rates to and from many orbitals and thereby somewhat muting the effect of positional disorder on the other hand , if @xmath0 is small relative to the typical inter - site spacing @xmath22 ( i.e. for large @xmath14 ) , the tunneling is preponderantly to the very closest neighbors ; moreover , even small fluctuations in the locations of nearest neighbors impact charge transport through the site to a significant degree via the exponential dependence of the hopping integral .",
    "hence , disorder is in a sense amplified as @xmath14 is increased and muted when @xmath14 is small .    in calculating the tight binding wave functions",
    ", we examine a @xmath23 supercell , where many system sizes are considered in order to perform finite size scaling and determine the degree to which eigenstates are localized in the bulk limit .",
    "energies obtained by diagonalizing the tight binding ( hermitian ) hamiltonian are used to construct the global density of states ( dos ) , while the eigenstates themselves are retained for analysis to characterize the electronic wave functions with respect to localization with the aid of a single quantity known as the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) , @xmath24 .",
    "the participation ratio shows distinct behavior depending on whether the wave function is confined to a small volume or spread out over a larger region , and hence more extended in character .",
    "while in the former case the ipr is finite and tends to be relatively large , the participation ratio is smaller for broader electronic states , and approaches zero as the wave function becomes spread over a bulk system in the case of a genuinely extended state .",
    "this dichotomy for extended _ vis  vis _ localized states makes the ipr a useful diagnostic parameter in the context of theoretical calculations where often the participation ratio provides information as to the extent of localization of carrier wave functions in specific locations in an amorphous geometry or in certain energy ranges of a band structure  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we aim to determine for very large 1d , 2d , and 3d amorphous systems the prevalence of extended states , and we construct phase portraits showing where wave functions are localized and where states are extended .",
    "the random character of the disorder precludes a direct observation of the evolution of the characteristics of electronic states as the system size @xmath25 is increased .",
    "however , there remains the possibility of determining in a statistical sense the localization characteristics of the amorphous medium by calculating the inverse participation ratio histogram .",
    "shifts in the weight of the ipr probability distribution with increasing @xmath25 provide information as to how many of the electronic states ultimately are localized and what portion are genuinely extended . for a specific hopping integral decay parameter @xmath14",
    "we find the status of electronic states with respect to localization to be determined exclusively by the energy eigenvalue , with no situation arising in which localized and extended states exist simultaneously for the same infinitesimal energy interval . with a finite size scaling analysis of the participation ratio histogram calculated for various system sizes ,",
    "we extrapolate to the bulk limit and determine in a rigorous fashion energies where electronic states are localized , and eigenenergies supporting extended states .    by repeating the calculation for different @xmath14",
    ", we obtain phase portraits showing regions of localized and extended wave functions .",
    "the ipr probability distributions represent an intermediate stage in the determination of energy ranges corresponding to localized or extended states in the bulk limit , but are of interest in themselves and highlight salient qualitative trends .",
    "a participation ratio histogram which does not change either in its shape or position with increasing system size signifies that all states encompassed in the distribution are localized , and the ipr distribution may be regarded as a bulk characteristic where @xmath26 with @xmath27 being the localization length scale of the eigenstates . at",
    "the opposite extreme is a participation ratio histogram which shifts in its entirety toward smaller ipr values with increasing @xmath25 .",
    "the steady transfer of a large share of statistical weight toward even smaller participation ratios implies the electronic states are preponderantly extended .",
    "a possibility interpolating between the two extremes arises if a part of the ipr distribution converges as would be expected for a set of localized states while at the same time a portion of the histogram separates from the main envelope of the distribution and is conveyed toward lower ipr values .    to sample realizations of disorder from the appropriate statistical distribution , it is important to generate random configurations of atoms in an unbiased way . for stochastic input ,",
    "we use a mersenne twister algorithm to minimize correlations among successively generated random numbers and to ensure the period of the pseudorandom sequence far exceeds the quantity of random numbers used over the course of the simulations . for continuously distributed hopping sites ,",
    "the number @xmath4 of sites in the simulation volume must in general vary from one sample to the next due to statistical fluctuations . the integer value closest to the mean occupancy @xmath28 is a convenient initial choice , and random variations in the number of particles in the simulation volume are taken into account with a sequence of stochastically driven attempts either to raise or lower @xmath4 .",
    "the latter are part of an importance sampling scheme similar to that used to derive the metropolis criterion  @xcite at the heart of monte carlo simulations which sample the boltzmann distribution in the calculation of thermodynamic variables .",
    "to determine the probability of @xmath4 sites in @xmath29 , we divide @xmath30 into @xmath31 sub - volumes of equal size where @xmath32 . for large @xmath31",
    "the likelihood of multiple occupancy in any of the sub - volumes is very small relative to the chance of having one or zero sites in a subdivision ; in the small @xmath33 limit , the single occupancy probability is @xmath34 , with @xmath35 being the complementary likelihood of null occupancy .",
    "hence , the probability the entire system is devoid of hopping sites is @xmath36 , which becomes @xmath37 for @xmath38 . for single occupancy , adopting a prefactor @xmath31 to take into consideration that the site may reside in any of the @xmath31 sub - volumes , yields @xmath39 , which becomes @xmath40 in the @xmath41 limit .",
    "similar logic is used for general case , and the probability for having exactly @xmath4 sites in the simulation volume is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a combinatorial factor to compensate for multiple counting .    to generate a realization of disorder",
    ", a succession of attempts ( a number of moves in the vicinity of @xmath44 is sufficient to achieve ergodicity ) is made to raise or lower the occupancy number @xmath4 , where the choice to increase or decrease @xmath4 is randomly determined . for increments from @xmath4 to @xmath45 ,",
    "the relevant criterion is the probability ratio @xmath46 , and the change is accepted is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a random number sampled uniformly from the interval @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "similarly , decreasing @xmath4 to @xmath50 occurs if @xmath51 where @xmath52 . with @xmath4",

    "inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) statistical distributions are discussed in section iii with ipr histograms displayed for various system sizes . in section iv ,",
    "the channel averaged participation ratios are shown ; we argue that ipr channel averages are representative of a particular energy and hence may be used to determine how the ipr scales with system size .",
    "ultimately , in section v , a finite size scaling analysis of the participation ratio channel averages is used to extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit and thereby yield the mean bulk ipr .",
    "the latter , used to construct phase portraits showing where states are extended or localized for different values of @xmath56 and @xmath14 , indicates for @xmath57 a zone of extended states in the midst of a region of localized states and flanked by two mobility boundaries .",
    "although a finite fraction of the states are extended even for large @xmath14 where disorder fluctuations are very important , the width of the interval of energies @xmath58 where states are extended decreases rapidly for large to moderate @xmath14 , with an asymptotically exponential dependence @xmath59 .",

    "accordingly , we partition the energy interval between the ground state and the uppermost excited state into a finite though reasonably large number of sub - intervals or `` bins '' .",
    "the augmented resolution achieved with an increase in the total number of partitions is counterbalanced with a rise in the magnitude of statistical fluctuations . to strike a suitable balance among detail and noise , 500 divisions are used in preparing dos histograms ; with a total of @xmath54 eigenvalues for each dos curve , choosing 500 bins still allows on average for 1,000 data point for each partition .",
    "we examine dos curves for 1d , 2d , and 3d systems , for which a salient common characteristic is a rapid convergence of the energy eigenvalue statistical distributions with respect to the system size @xmath25 .",

    "probability density is transferred from @xmath66 to negative energies as in the case @xmath60 .",

    "may also be gleaned at a qualitative level when participation ratio curves are juxtaposed for a range of system sizes . since the ipr may vary by several orders of magnitude over the full gamut of system sizes @xmath25 under consideration",

    "the ipr histograms invariably converge and cease to evolve with increases in the system size , a characteristic consistent with the localization of all wave functions in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "when converged in @xmath25 to an ipr distribution appropriate to the bulk limit , histograms are dominated by cusp - like peaks near the upper limit of the ipr range .",
    "the latter characteristic is a hallmark particular to 1d systems and is evident whether the hopping integral length scale @xmath0 is large or small relative to the separation between sites .",
    "the interpretation from the @xmath60 participation ratio distributions that all wave functions are localized is in a sense not surprising . with the theoretical framework of anderson localization",
    "having been introduced more than 50 years ago  @xcite , a significant body of work ( both in experiment and theoretical calculations ) has examined the tendency for random potentials to localize electronic states very effectively in one dimensional systems , even for weak random potentials . moreover ,",
    "the availability of cold atom traps with coherent quantum states where the underlying one dimensional potential may be tailored in a variety of ways has made possible the study of localization properties of 1d systems in a controlled manner . in this vein , a direct experimental observation of localization has recently been achieved in a bose - einstein condensate with the random ( diagonal ) potential set up by a laser speckle  @xcite with results in accord with theoretical descriptions  @xcite .",
    "bichromatic aperiodic potentials are not purely random uncorrelated disorder , but nonetheless have been found in experiment and theoretical analysis  @xcite to be very effective in localizing quantum states . in this work ,",
    "we show using finite size scaling analysis that off - diagonal disorder inherent in one dimensional amorphous systems leads to the localization of all electronic states in the absence of random site potentials .    for @xmath61 ,",
    "the evolution of the participation ratio with increasing @xmath25 depends on the hopping integral decay length @xmath0 .",
    "ipr histograms for various @xmath14 values are shown in the six panels of fig .",

    "moreover , the convergence of histograms with respect to @xmath25 is an indication of the localization of all states in the thermodynamic limit .    for longer decay lengths",
    "@xmath0 ( i.e. for @xmath82 ) participation ratio distributions obtained for 2d amorphous systems lack the unimodal sharply peaked structure seen for small @xmath0 and unlike the @xmath83 counterparts , seem not to converge with respect to increases in @xmath25 . instead , histograms become bimodal as statistical weight is transferred to the left , toward the lower ipr regime .",
    "the migration of statistical weight toward lower ipr values and more extended character , is indicative of the possible existence of extended states , and the effect is particular striking for the smallest decay rates @xmath84 and @xmath70 .",
    "the systematic transfer with increasing @xmath25 of probability density to smaller ipr values is manifest as a steady leftward shift of the trailing ( low ipr ) edge and of the histogram with the nearby maximum also born leftward .",
    "in fact , the shift both of the peak and the left - most front is constant in magnitude each time the system size @xmath25 is doubled ; since the abscissa is @xmath85 , the latter trend corresponds to a power law scaling @xmath86 for the left trailing edge and low ipr peak .",
    "participation ratio histograms for 3d systems are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] . as in the large @xmath0 limit for 2d systems , a portion of the participation ratio statistical weight shifts systematically to lower ipr values .",

    "a noteworthy feature for @xmath87 is the robustness of the probability density contained in the leftward shifting peak .",
    "that the packet moves systematically toward lower ipr values without leaving behind any statistical weight is compatible with the existence of a finite fraction of extended states in the bulk limit .",
    "thus , for 3d amorphous systems , there is a dichotomy in the way the distribution changes , where the leftward shifting probability density corresponding to extended wave functions contrasts with the localized states encompassed in the high ipr region of the histogram , which ceases to evolve with increasing @xmath25 . with increasing tunneling matrix element range @xmath0 , the balance shifts in favor of the extended states as more and more statistical weight",
