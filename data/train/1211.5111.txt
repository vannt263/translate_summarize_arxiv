    "since , for @xmath395 , the newtonian potential @xmath396 verifies the hypotheses of lemma [ le : hartree ] , the convergence results are also valid for the 3-d schrdinger - poisson equation : @xmath397    in lower dimensions , @xmath398 , the kernel @xmath399 is not bounded and therefore lemma [ le : hartree ] does not apply .",
