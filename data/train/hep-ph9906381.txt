    "there are three ( weyl , dirac and majorana ) types of spin - half fermion fields .",
    "massless fermions are weyl particles .",
    "massive spin - half objects can be of either dirac or majorana type .",
    "all charged fermions are dirac particles as a consequence of the electric charge conservation .",
    "conservation of the lepton number is decidedly less fundamental than the electric charge conservation . without lepton number conservation , neutrinos",
    "do not hold any additive internal ` charge ' and can be identical to their own antiparticles .",
    "such fermions are known as majorana particles .",
    "the problem whether neutrinos are of dirac or majorana type has a long history ( for a review , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the main problem is that observable effects which could differentiate between them disappear continuously with the vanishing of masses for single - handed states .",
    "this is known as the `` practical dirac - majorana confusion theorem '' @xcite .    from the theoretical point of view",
    "it is quite likely that neutrinos are majorana particles .",
    "such objects are more fundamental and almost all extensions of the standard model predict their existence .",
    "dirac particles can be considered as composed of two majorana particles with opposite cp parities .",
    "but even if theory suggests that neutrinos are presumably identical to their own antiparticles , such a property should be checked experimentally .",
    "it might be , that we reached a point where the correct answer is close .",
    "an obvious place is the neutrinoless double @xmath0 decay , ( @xmath1)@xmath2 , of nuclei .",
    "the heidelberg - moscow germanium experiment gives a lower limit on the half - life time @xcite    @xmath3    this result excludes an effective majorana neutrino mass greater than 0.2 ev @xmath4    the heidelberg - moscow collaboration proposed a new project ( genius ) which is anticipated to be sensitive on @xcite : @xmath5    these bounds alone are not enough to deduce the nature of neutrinos .",
    "they give only restrictions on the combination of majorana neutrino mixing matrix elements @xmath6 and their masses @xmath7 .",
    "however , this information can be linked to other experiments .",
    "the connection between mass and oscillation properties of neutrinos , which follows from different experiments , has been discussed in many papers @xcite .",
    "howerever , most authors assume that neutrinos are majorana particles . in this case",
    ", bounds on the @xmath8 decay give either informations on the solar neutrino mechanism , or on the neutrino mass scale ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "inversely , a guess on the solar neutrino mechanism , together with a neutrino mass scale , yields @xmath9 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    here",
    "we propose a different line of thought .",
    "the information on neutrino matrix elements and masses , given by oscillation experiments and tritium @xmath10 decay , is independent of the neutrino nature .",
    "we collect this data from the existing experiments and many phenomenological works @xcite , and use it to check whether bounds from negative @xmath8 results are satisfied . if they are , neutrinos may be ( but not necessarily are ) majorana particles , if not they must be dirac particles . in this work",
    ", we discuss present ( eq .",
    "( 2 ) ) , and future bounds ( eq . ( 3 ) ) on the @xmath8 decay .    in the next section",
    "we collect all the relevant information on mixing matrix elements and masses extracted from experiments and establish two general mass schemes which are consistent with both solar and atmospheric data .",
    "we assume that only three massive neutrinos exist with two different and independent @xmath11m@xmath12 .",
    "this means that we do not consider the still unsettled lsnd anomaly @xcite waiting for its future confirmation @xcite .",
    "the main discussion is given in section 3 , where we try to infer the neutrino s character in the frame of the proposed neutrino schemes .",
    "conclusions are to be found in section 4 .",
    "since we want to discuss both dirac and majorana neutrinos we must introduce appropriate mixing matrices . without loss of generality we work in a basis where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal @xcite .",
    "the matrix that relates the flavour majorana states to the mass eigenstates may be parameterized by three euler angles @xmath13 , i=1,2,3 and three phases @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite . however , only one of the three phases ( @xmath11 ) has physical meaning to neutrino oscillations , independently of the neutrino character @xcite .",
    "the two other phases ( @xmath16 ) enter the ( @xmath1)@xmath17 amplitude .",
    "so , let us write the mixing matrix in a compact form ( c s and s s are shortcuts for appropriate @xmath13 cosines and sines , respectively ) : @xmath18    where @xmath19 and @xmath20    all relevant neutrino experiments have been analyzed assuming that neutrinos oscillate .",

    "2 .   in the second situation , masses are almost degenerate @xmath40 , but schemes i and ii , which describe solar and atmospheric anomalies , are the same . since cosmological estimations give @xcite + @xmath41 + all three neutrinos have masses close to ( or below ) 1.7 ev .",
    "oscillations of dirac and majorana neutrinos share the same description . bounds on mixing angles eqs.(5 - 10 )",

    "let us explore now the hierarchical mass scheme ii from fig.1 : @xmath71 this again can be transformed into : @xmath72    from unitarity of the u matrix follows that the present bound is always satisfied .",
    "the result of genius is much more interesting .",
    "we can find the minimal values of the effective mass    @xmath73    for vo and lma msw solutions of the solar neutrino problem , a negative result of the genius experiment would mean that neutrinos must be dirac particles , since our bounds exceed those infered by this collaboration . for the sma msw solution , conclusions depend on the values of @xmath74 .",

    "now , the ( @xmath1)@xmath17 bound has the form :    @xmath78 @xmath59    the discussion is more difficult , since we do not have any information about the cp violating phases @xmath79 .",

    "this means that almost degenerate neutrinos can not have the same cp parities @xcite , and the cp parity of the heaviest neutrino can not be opposite to the cp eigenvalues of the lighter ones .",
