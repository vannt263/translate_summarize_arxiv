    "diffuse x - rays were discovered from the inner disk of the milky way galaxy with the heao-1 satellite @xcite , and called as the galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ) .",
    "exosat observed more details and found that the grxe were extended by about @xmath6 in longitude and @xmath7@xmath8 ) in latitude @xcite .",
    "the tenma satellite discovered strong emission lines at the energy of about 6.7 kev ( here the 6.7-kev line ) in the grxe @xcite .",
    "the ginga satellite made survey observations along the galactic plane with the 6.7-kev line , and found a flux peak at the galactic center with the width of about @xmath9 .",
    "we call this peak as the galactic center diffuse x - rays ( gcdx ) @xcite .",
    "the asca satellite separated the 6.7-kev line in the gcdx into three emission lines at 6.4 , 6.7 and 7.0 kev , which were respectively identified as k@xmath0 lines from neutral ( fe ) , he - like ( fe ) and h - like ( fe ) iron @xcite .",
    "for the grxe , the suzaku satellite resolved the fe k@xmath0 lines @xcite .",
    "the strongest emission line in the gcdx and grxe is fe k@xmath0 at 6.7 kev , and hence would be due to an optically thin thermal plasma . from the flux ratio of fe k@xmath0/fe k@xmath0 ,",
    "the plasma temperature of the gcdx was estimated to be around @xmath10510 kev ( e.g. @xcite ) .    since spectra of the gcdx and grxe have spatial temperature variations and/or may be contaminated by possible non - thermal emissions , we concentrate on the flux of fe k@xmath0 line as a pure component of the thin thermal plasma .",
    "previous studies of the fe k@xmath0 lines with the ginga and rxte satellites @xcite had limited spatial resolutions ( fwhm @xmath11@xmath8 ) compared to the size of the gcdx , and the fe k@xmath0 line flux was contaminated by the adjacent fe and k@xmath0 lines due to the limited energy resolutions ( fwhm @xmath12 1.1 kev at 6 kev ) .",
    "@xcite reported that the intensity ratio of the three fe k@xmath0 lines has spatial dependence and hence to resolve the three lines is essential for the study the nature of fe k@xmath0 line .",
    "this paper reports , for the first time , the fe k@xmath0 line distributions in the gcdx and the transient region from the gcdx to the grxe ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) with the ccd cameras onboard the suzaku satellite .",
    "the observations and data reduction are described in section 2 .",
    "the analysis and the intensities of fe k@xmath0 , fe k@xmath0 and fe k@xmath0 are given in section 3 . in section 4 , we compare the fe k@xmath0 profiles of the gcdx and grxe with that of a stellar mass model made from near infrared ( nir ) observations .",
    "based on the profile comparison between nir stars and fe k@xmath0 , we discuss origin of the gcdx . in this paper ,",
    "uncertainties are quoted at the 90% confidence range unless otherwise stated .",
    "the data in this paper were obtained from september 2005 to march 2009 with the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) onboard the suzaku satellite .",
    "most of the data were observed as the suzaku key project observation .",
    "the total effective exposure is about 3.2  ms .",
    "the details of these observations are summarized in table [ tab : obslog_gc ] .",
    "the xis contains four sets of x - ray ccd camera systems ( xis  0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 ) placed on the focal planes of four x - ray telescopes ( xrts ) onboard the suzaku satellite .",
    "xis  0 , 2 , and 3 have front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds , while xis  1 has a back - illuminated ( bi ) ccd .",
    "detailed descriptions of the suzaku satellite , the xrt , and the xis can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively .    in these observations ,",
    "the xis was operated in the normal clocking full window mode , with the time resolution of 8.0  s. one of the fi ccd cameras ( xis  2 ) has been out of function since november 2006 , and hence 71% of the total exposure was observed without xis  2 . although the xis ccds were significantly degraded by on - orbit particle radiation , the ccd performance had been calibrated well with the checker - flag charge - injection ( ci ) method @xcite until october 2006 , and has been restored with the spaced - row ci ( sci ) method @xcite .",
    "the sci method was used in 75% of the total exposure . the xis  2 and sci status in the observations",
    "is shown in table [ tab : obslog_gc ] .",
    "we reprocessed the data using the calibration data base ( caldb ) released at 2008 - 10 - 20 and xispi in the headas software package version 6.6.1 .",
    "we confirmed that the center energy of mn k@xmath0 line of the onboard calibration sources ( @xmath15fe ) was consistent with 5.895  ev within the calibration uncertainty of 20 ev , and the energy resolutions were 130180 ev ( fwhm ) at 5.9 kev during the observations .",
    "in order to investigate intensity profiles of fe k@xmath0 lines along the galactic longitude and latitude , x - ray spectra were made from the rectangles shown in figures [ fig : fig1]a and b , respectively .",
    "the sizes of the rectangles along the longitude ( figure [ fig : fig1]a ) are @xmath16 ( @xmath17 in longitude and @xmath18 in latitude ) , while those along the latitude ( figure [ fig : fig1]b ) are @xmath19 ( @xmath18 in longitude and @xmath17 in latitude ) . here",
    "we adopted a new coordinate as @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) , where the origin of this coordinate @xmath22 is the position of sgr a@xmath23 @xcite and the @xmath24 line corresponds the galactic plane . with this new coordinate ,",
    "the centers of each rectangle along the longitude ( figure [ fig : fig1]a ) are given as @xmath25 , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an integer number .",
    "the centers of each rectangle along the latitude ( figure [ fig : fig1]b ) are @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . to extend the profile to larger @xmath37 values",
    ", we used the data at @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( obsid 502059010 ) .",
    "since the fe k@xmath0 flux at this position is lower than any other regions , we made a spectrum of @xmath40 rectangle .",
    "to make spectra of diffuse emission , bright sources listed in table [ tab : brsrc ] and the ccd corners illuminated by the calibration sources were excluded from all the rectangles .",
    "\\(a ) ( 80mm,60mm)figure1a.eps + ( b ) ( 80mm,60mm)figure1b.eps    using xissimarfgen @xcite and xisrmfgen , the effective area of the xrt and the response of the xis were calculated , and ancillary response files and redistribution matrix files were made for each observation . since the responses of the fis are almost the same , we merged the fi spectra .",
    "the non x - ray background ( nxb ) spectra sorted by the cut - off rigidity were made from the same source region in the detector coordinate using xisnxbgen @xcite .",
    "the spectra of nxb were subtracted from those of the gcdx .    [ cols=\"^,>,>,^ \" , ]     @xmath41 see equation [ eq : integral2 ] .",
    "the units are @xmath42 photons s@xmath43 @xmath44 . @xmath45",
    "mass emissivities of the galactic bulge and the galactic disk are fixed to the best - fit of @xmath46 and @xmath47 regions .",
    "1 .   we have obtained intensity profiles of the fe  , fe  , and fe   k@xmath0 lines in the galactic center region of @xmath13 and @xmath48 .",
    "the intensity profile of fe k@xmath0 is nicely fitted with the smd model in the grxe region ( @xmath46 or @xmath49 ) , while that in the gcdx ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) shows @xmath52@xmath53 times excess over the best - fit smd model to the profile of the grxe region .",
    "this appendix describes the details of the three - dimensional stellar mass distribution ( smd ) and actual two - dimensional fitting model ( smd model ) in section 4 .",
    "the smd model was originally compiled by @xcite using the results of @xcite and @xcite based on near infrared ( nir ) observations with cobe , iras and irt @xcite .",
    "the major emission sources at the nir wavelength ( 17 @xmath54 m ) are main - sequence stars and thus the nir emission is a good tracer of the stellar mass .",
    "the stellar mass model consists of the components of the nuclear stellar cluster ( nsc ) , the nuclear stellar disk ( nsd ) , galactic bulge ( gb ) and galactic disk ( gd ) . in order to describe the three - dimensional stellar mass distribution of these components ,",
    "we defined the x - y - z coordinate , where sgr a@xmath23 is located at the origin @xmath55 , and the galactic plane is the x - y plane .",

    "we took @xmath78 for @xmath75  pc , and adjusted @xmath79 to make the function continuous at @xmath80 = 120 and 220 pc .",
    "the parameters for the gd are @xmath81 , @xmath82 pc and @xmath83=200 pc .",
    "the gb component is modeled as a triaxial `` generalized ellipsoidal '' bar @xcite .",
    "since the major axis of this `` ellipsoid '' is tilted from any of the x- , y- and z - axis , we defined a new coordinate @xmath84-@xmath85-@xmath86 by rotating the x - y - z coordinate along the z - axis by @xmath87 to the east and along the y - axis by @xmath9 to the north . in the new coordinate @xmath84-@xmath85-@xmath86 , the gb",

    "for the three - dimensional mass distribution function @xmath95 of the components nsc ( a1 ) , nsd ( a2 ) , gd ( a3 ) and gb ( a46 ) , we defined the mass emissivity of fe k@xmath0 line @xmath96 ( in units of photons s@xmath43 @xmath44 ) to be the ratio of fe k@xmath0 photons emitted from a unit stellar ( infrared stars ) mass per second .",
    "the number of fe k@xmath0 photons emitted per second from a small volume in the solid angle @xmath97 ( a rectangle of @xmath98 ) and depth @xmath99 at the distance @xmath100 from the sun toward ( @xmath101 , @xmath37 ) direction is given as @xmath102 .",
    "the observed flux @xmath103 from the small volume should be @xmath104 .",
