    "although the logarithmic divergence for the pure quantum chain is reminiscent of the logarithmic divergence of the specific heat of the 2d classical ising model , the cusp singularity found for the random quantum chain is different from the specific heat singularity of the corresponding 2d mccoy - wu model @xcite .",
