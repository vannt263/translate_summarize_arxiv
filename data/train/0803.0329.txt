    "their existence can not be explained with a formation scenario involving a collision and tidal evolution , as has been proposed for the formation of the moon and charon @xcite , since it can not provide the current angular momentum of the binary system . in a formation scenario proposed by @xcite two kuiper belt objects ( kbos )",
    "collide with each other inside the hill sphere of a third .",
    "however , in the kuiper belt , gravitational scattering between the two intruders is about 100 times and assumed that the velocity dispersion of the kbos at the time of binary formation is less than their hill velocity , see  2 for details ] more common than a collision .",
    "therefore , three body gravitational deflection ( @xmath1 mechanism ) , as proposed by @xcite , should dominate the binary formation over such collisional scenario . a second binary formation scenario that has been suggested by @xcite consists of the formation of a transient binary that gets bound with the aid of dynamical friction from a sea of small bodies .",
    "we call this the @xmath0 mechanism . in the formation scenario of @xcite and @xcite",
    "the existence of long lived transient binaries that spend a long time in their mutual hill sphere , near a periodic orbit , is responsible for the creation of kuiper belt binaries ( kbbs ) .",
    "finally , @xcite proposed a binary formation mechanism that involves a collision between two large kbos .",
    "this collision creates a small moon that is replaced in an exchange reaction by a massive body with high eccentricity and large semi - major axis .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mechanism leave unique signatures in the relative abundance of prograde to retrograde binary orbits .",
    "the @xmath0 mechanism dominates over the @xmath1 mechanism for sub - hill velocities @xcite .",
    "we argue that binaries that form from dynamically cold kbos by the @xmath0 mechanism have retrograde orbits .",
    "this is due to the existence of stable retrograde binary orbits with modified jacobi constants similar to that of unbound kbos on circular orbits that have impact parameters that correspond to distances of closest approach of less than the hill radius .",

    "since dynamical friction only gradually increases the modified jacobi constant ( for a binary this corresponds to gradually increasing the absolute value of the binding energy ) , all binaries that form via the @xmath0 mechanism , or any other mechanism that dissipates energy in a smooth and gradual manner , will start with modified jacobi constants close to that of unbound kbos that penetrate the hill sphere and hence have retrograde orbits . for super - hill kbo velocities ,",
    "only the @xmath1 mechanism can form tight binaries that tend to survive @xcite .",
    "the fact that retrograde orbits are stable for larger semi - major axes is no longer of importance since only tight binaries are saved from break up .",
    "this , therefore , leads to the formation of a roughly equal number of prograde and retrograde binaries for super - hill kbo velocities .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : in  2 we outline our assumptions , explain our choice of parameters and define variables that will be used throughout this paper .",
    "we calculate the ratio of prograde to retrograde binary orbits for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mechanism and predict the relative abundance of prograde to retrograde orbits for sub - hill and super - hill kbo velocities in  3 .",

    "the hill radius denotes the distance from a body at which the tidal forces due to the sun and the gravitational force due to the body , both acting on a test particle , are in equilibrium .",
    "it is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the masses of the two kbos , @xmath5 is their semi - major axis around the sun and @xmath6 the mass of the sun .",
    "our definition of the hill radius differs from that used by @xcite since we include the combined mass of both kbos here .",
    "we chose to do so since it will make comparisons with works by other authors easier .",
    "we use the ` two - group approximation ' @xcite which consists of the identification of two groups of objects , small ones , that contain most of the total mass with surface mass density @xmath7 , and large ones , that contain only a small fraction of the total mass with surface mass density @xmath8 .",

    "estimates from kuiper belt surveys @xcite yield @xmath11 for kbos with radii of @xmath12 .",
    "we use this value of @xmath13 , assuming that @xmath13 during the formation of kbbs was the same as it is now .",
    "our choice for @xmath13 and @xmath7 is also consistent with results from numerical coagulation simulations by @xcite .",
    "large bodies grow by the accretion of small bodies .",
    "large kbos viscously stir the small bodies , increasing the small bodies velocity dispersion @xmath14 .",
    "as a result @xmath14 grows on the same timescale as @xmath15 provided that mutual collisions among the small bodies are not yet important . in this case , @xmath14 is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 at @xmath10 @xcite .",

    "balancing the stirring and damping rates of @xmath21 and substituting for @xmath14 from equation ( [ e2 ] ) , we find @xmath23 for our choice of parameters , we have sub - hill kbo velocities during the epoch of formation of bodies with @xmath24 .",
    "we therefore focus our work on the shear - dominated velocity regime ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "however , we discuss how our results would be modified if @xmath26 .",
    "the disk of kbos is effectively two - dimensional in the shear - dominated velocity regime ( @xmath27 ) , since the growth of inclinations is suppressed @xcite .",
    "we therefore restrict our calculations for the shear - dominated velocity regime to two dimensions .",
    "since we are interested in close encounters among the kbos , their interaction is well described by hill s equations @xcite . in hill",
    "coordinates the equations of motion of the two kbos can be decomposed into their center of mass motion and their relative motion with respect to one another .",
    "the modified jacobi constant is exactly conserved in the hill formalism , but the hill formalism itself is an approximation to the general three body problem .",
    "it assumes that the masses of body 1 and 2 ( in our case the two kbos ) are much less than that of the sun .",
    "we use the standard hill coordinate system and reference frame as in @xcite and @xcite . in this rotating frame",
    "the direction of the @xmath28-axis is given by the line connecting the sun and the center of mass of the two kbos such that the positive @xmath28 direction is pointing away from the sun .",
    "the @xmath29-axis is perpendicular to the @xmath28-axis pointing in the direction of motion of the kbos center of mass around the sun . in hill",

    "coordinates the lagrangian points @xmath33 and @xmath34 are located at @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively , where we define @xmath33 as the lagrangian point located between the kbo and the sun .",
    "their modified jacobi constants are @xmath37 . from equation [ e4 ]",
    "we can see that tight binaries with small separations have @xmath38 .",
    "we call a binary orbit prograde if its angular momentum about the binary center of mass , as viewed in the non rotating frame , is in the same direction as the orbital angular momentum of the binary around the sun .",
    "if the binary angular momentum is in the opposite direction to the orbital angular momentum of the binary around the sun , the orbit is called retrograde .",
    "several authors recognized that planar retrograde orbits are stable for larger semi - major axes than prograde orbits ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a prograde binary with an initially circular orbit becomes unbound for @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the initial semi - major axis of the mutual binary orbit @xcite .",
    "this implies that prograde orbits with modified jacobi constants less than that of the lagrangian points @xmath33 and @xmath34 are unbound .",
    "in contrast to the prograde case , there exist stable retrograde binary orbits with @xmath41 .",
    "this result is also shown in figures [ fig1 ] .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows histograms of @xmath42 for prograde and retrograde binaries that formed by @xmath1 mechanism from kbos with initially circular orbits around the sun . in the reminder of this paper we discuss the stability of prograde and retrograde orbits in terms of @xmath42 and not semi - major axis since the latter is not well defined ( i.e. it is not a constant of motion ) for wide orbits with @xmath43 .",
    "the modified jacobi constant for two kbos that approach each other from infinity is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the initial separation between the two kbos in the @xmath28 direction and @xmath46 is the relative eccentricity in hill units given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the eccentricity vectors of body 1 and body 2 respectively . only kbos with @xmath45 ranging from @xmath50 to @xmath51 penetrate each others hill sphere if started on circular orbits . from equation ( [ e14 ] )",
    "we have therefore that only kbos with @xmath52 have a distance of closest approach of @xmath53 or less provided that they started on circular orbits around the sun .",
    "in the @xmath0 mechanism kbbs form from transient binaries that become bound with the aid of dynamical friction from a sea of small bodies .",
    "this dynamical friction provides a gentle force that damps the random velocity of large kbos . for typical parameters ,",
    "the dynamical friction force only extracts a small fraction of energy over an orbital timescale .",
    "therefore , kbbs that form via the @xmath0 mechanism , or any other mechanism that dissipates energy gradually , have initially modified jacobi constants similar to that of the unbound kbos that penetrate within the hill sphere . as mentioned above , for kbos that started on circular orbits around the sun",
    "this corresponds to @xmath54 .",
    "however , only stable retrograde orbits exist with @xmath55 .",
    "this implies that all kbb that form this way must have retrograde orbits since no stable prograde orbits exist for @xmath56 .",
    "once a binary is formed , dynamical friction increases the modified jacobi constant and the absolute value of the binary binding energy .",
    "we confirm that all binaries that form from kbos on initially circular orbits around the sun via the @xmath57 mechanism are retrograde by numerical integrations that are presented below .",
    "since it is not feasible to examine the interactions with each small body individually , their net effect is modeled by an averaged force which acts to damp the large kbos non - circular velocity around the sun .",
    "we parameterize the strength of the damping by a dimensionless quantity @xmath58 defined as the fractional decrease in non - circular velocity due to dynamical friction over a time @xmath32 : @xmath59 the first expression is simply an estimate of dynamical friction by a sea of small bodies assuming @xmath60 .",
    "the second expression describes the mutual excitation among the large kbos for @xmath27 . @xmath21",
    "achieves a quasi - steady state on a timescale shorter than at which @xmath15 grows since only a subset of the deflected bodies are accreted .",
    "the stirring among the large kbos can therefore be equated to the damping due to dynamical friction ( for a detailed derivation see @xcite ) .    since the growth of inclinations is suppressed in the shear - dominated velocity regime the disk of kbos is effectively two - dimensional @xcite .",
    "we therefore restrict this calculation to two dimensions . in hill",
    "coordinates the relative motion of two equal mass kbos , including the dynamical friction term , is governed by @xmath61 @xmath62 length has been scaled by @xmath31 and time by @xmath32 .",
    "equations ( [ e6 ] ) and ( [ e7 ] ) are integrated for different values of @xmath58 and impact parameters ranging from @xmath50 to @xmath51 with equal step size .",
    "impact parameters outside this range result in a distance of closest approach between the two kbos of more than @xmath53 .    for @xmath63",
    ", we performed 20000 integrations .",
    "about two percent of these integrations resulted in the formation of a binary .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows three examples of the evolution of the specific angular momentum and @xmath42 of binary formation events from our integrations for @xmath63 .",
    "in addition , we performed integrations for values of @xmath58 ranging from 0.1 to 0.0004 and find that , just like in the @xmath63 case , only retrograde binaries form .",
    "we define @xmath64 as the specific angular momentum of the binary in the non rotating frame .",
    "it can be written as @xmath65 and is related to the total binary orbital angular momentum , @xmath66 , by @xmath67 .",
    "the time @xmath68 corresponds to the time at which @xmath69 if the relative kbo velocity is solely due to the keplerian sheer ( i.e. ignoring the actual gravitational interaction between the bodies )",
    ". the evolution of @xmath64 and @xmath42 is shown until the binary separation has decreased to @xmath70 or less .",
    "binaries with separations of @xmath70 or less are sufficiently tight that perturbations from the sun are too weak to flip the sign of the angular momentum .",
    "as expected from our discussion above , the angular momenta of the binaries are negative corresponding to retrograde binary orbits .",
    "in fact all binaries that form via the @xmath0 mechanism in our numerical integrations display retrograde orbits .",
    "dynamical friction shrinks the binary separation . as a result ,",
    "the magnitude of the binary angular momenta decreases with time .",
    "the right hand side of figure [ fig2 ] shows the evolution of the modified jacobi constant .",
    "newly formed binaries initially have a modified jacobi constant @xmath71 which is possible only for retrograde binaries",
    ". dynamical friction shrinks the semi - major axes of the binaries which leads to an increase of @xmath42 with time while keeping the sense of rotation , i.e. the sign of @xmath64 , fixed .",
    "eventually the modified jacobi constant grows to values above @xmath72 . for @xmath73 prograde orbits can exist ;",
    "however all binaries that formed with the aid of dynamical friction started out with @xmath74 for which only retrograde orbits are stable",
    ". therefore , all kbb that form via the @xmath0 mechanism , or any other mechanism that gradually removes energy from transient binaries , orbit each other in the retrograde sense since otherwise they would not be able to form in the first place .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the evolution of @xmath64 and @xmath42 as a function of time for kbo encounters that did not lead to the formation of a binary .",
    "these examples show that kbos encounter each other and leave each other with positive angular momenta .",
    "this is a result of the keplerian sheer and follows from the definition of @xmath64 .",
    "we have assumed here that all kbos are initially on circular orbits around the sun and have shown that this leads to the formation of exclusively retrograde binaries in the @xmath0 mechanism . if , however , the velocity dispersion of the kbos is sufficiently large , such that @xmath46 is of the order of the hill eccentricity , bigger impact parameters allow the kbos to penetrate each others hill sphere . in this case",
    ", there now exist kbos that have an initial @xmath42 just a little below @xmath75 ( see equation [ e14 ] ) in which case only a small change in @xmath42 is sufficient for the formation of retrograde and prograde binaries .",
    "therfore , prograde binaries can form with the aid of dynamical friction provided that the velocity dispersion of the kbos is about @xmath18 .",
    "our prediction for the sense of the binary orbit relies on the assumption that dynamical friction does not alter the sense of the binary orbit in the subsequent binary evolution .",
    "although we have shown in our simulations that for our dynamical friction model this is indeed the case , it might be that the actual behavior of dynamical friction differs from the model implemented here .",
    "a transient binary forms when two large kbos penetrate each other s hill sphere .",
    "this transient binary must lose energy in order to become gravitationally bound . in the @xmath1 mechanism",
    "the excess energy is carried away by an encounter with a third massive body .",
    "this encounter can provide a significant change in energy which corresponds to a considerable change in @xmath42 .",
    "the modified jacobi constants of kbbs that form via the @xmath1 mechanism are therefore not constraint to values similar to that of their initial @xmath42 ; their orbits can therefore be both prograde and retrograde . we show that this is indeed the case with numerical integrations discussed below and determine the ratio of prograde to retrograde orbits for binary formation via the @xmath1 mechanism .",
    "our calculation is performed in the shear - dominated velocity regime in two dimensions . as initial condition",
    ", we assume that all bodies are on circular orbits .",
    "we modify hill s equations @xcite to include three equal mass bodies besides the sun .",
    "the equations of motion , with length scaled by @xmath31 and time by @xmath32 , for body 1 are given by @xmath76 @xmath77 the subscripts 1 , 2 and 3 label the @xmath28- and @xmath29-coordinates of kbo 1 , 2 , and 3 respectively .",
    "similar equations of motion can be obtained for bodies 2 and 3 .",
    "resulting binary orbits are calculated by numerically integrating the equations of motion .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for the exact details of these calculations .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows histograms of the modified jacobi constant of prograde and retrograde binaries that formed via the @xmath1 mechanism .",
    "both histograms are normalized to unity . as discussed above , we indeed find that prograde orbits only exist for @xmath78 .",
    "the stability of retrograde orbits extends below @xmath79 down to @xmath80 .",
    "it therefore includes the range @xmath81 with orbits that penetrate the hill sphere from circular heliocentric orbits . unlike the @xmath0 mechanism ,",
    "the @xmath1 mechanism does produce retrograde _ and _ prograde binaries for @xmath27 .",
    "we find that 65% of all binary orbits are retrograde and 35% prograde ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) . here , we only considered binary formation from three equal mass bodies that started on initially circular orbits around the sun .",
    "we therefore caution , that the ratio of prograde to retrograde orbits due to the @xmath1 mechanism might differ for other mass ratios and velocity dispersions .",
    "@xcite have shown that for sub - hill kbo velocities the ratio of the @xmath1 to @xmath0 binary formation rate is @xmath82 therefore , for sub - hill kbo velocities , binaries in the kuiper belt form primarily due to dynamical friction .",
    "for our estimate of @xmath83 , we have that @xmath84 , in which case @xmath85 of all binaries form directly by the @xmath1 mechanism .",
    "since prograde binaries can only form via the @xmath1 mechanism , they make up a negligible fraction of the total binaries . below",
    "we discuss how a somewhat larger fraction of prograde binaries can arise due to exchange reactions with unbound kbos .",
    "once a binary is formed its semi - major axis shirks due to dynamical friction provided by a sea of small bodies .",
    "dynamical friction decreases the orbit of a kbb that has an orbital velocity @xmath86 at a rate @xmath87 where we assume that @xmath88 .",
    "exchange reactions or binary break up by passing kbos occurs at a rate given by @xmath89 the ratio of these two rates is given by @xmath90 where @xmath27 and @xmath91 .",
    "break up or exchange reactions are most likely for wide binaries , in which case @xmath92 since @xmath86 increases as the semi - major axis of the mutual binary orbit decreases .",
    "therefore we have from equation ( [ e13 ] ) that @xmath93 for our estimate of @xmath83 .",
    "this implies that @xmath94 10% of all binaries that formed will suffer an exchange reaction or break up .",
    "we performed numerical integrations of binary break up and exchange reactions to obtain a more accurate estimate and find that only about 3% of the binaries suffer an exchange reaction and/or break up .",
    "our order of magnitude calculation , therefore , slightly over estimates the number of binaries that experience an exchange reaction and/or break up .",
    "moreover , only a fraction of the these binaries will end up as binaries with prograde orbits . in conclusion",
    ", we predict that the vast majority ( @xmath95% ) of comparable mass ratio binaries will have retrograde orbits if kbo velocities of @xmath96 prevailed during binary formation .",
    "this prediction assumes that subsequent orbital evolution due to dynamical friction did not alter the sense of the binary orbit after formation .",
    "there is some uncertainty in what the actual values of @xmath7 and @xmath13 were during binary formation .",
    "for a few times larger value of @xmath97 with @xmath98 unchanged , we enter the regime in which @xmath21 exceeds the hill velocity ( this can be seen from equation ( [ e3 ] ) ) .",
    "we discuss here briefly how this would affect the ratio of prograde to retrograde binary orbits .",
    "@xcite have shown that , for @xmath26 , only binaries that form with a binary separation of @xmath99 or less tend to be saved from break up .",
    "the @xmath0 mechanism fails in creating binaries with separations @xmath100 or less since dynamical friction is not able to dissipate sufficient energy for tight binaries to form .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 mechanism is not important if kbos have super - hill velocities .",
    "tight binaries ( with separations less than @xmath101 ) , can form via the @xmath1 mechanism .",
    "however in this case , the binary formation cross section is significantly reduced with respect to the sub - hill velocity regime ( see @xcite and @xcite for details ) .",
    "the fact that retrograde orbits are stable for larger semi - major axes is no longer of importance since only tight binaries tend to survive .",
    "we therefore predict that a roughly equal number of prograde and retrograde binaries form if super hill velocities prevail .",
    "this prediction is supported by figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the ratio of retrograde binaries with a modified jacobi constant of @xmath102 or larger to the total number of binaries that formed via the @xmath1 mechanism for @xmath27 .",
    "when all binaries are included we find that about @xmath103 have retrograde orbits .",
    "more retrograde than prograde binaries form because retrograde binary orbits are stable further out in the hill sphere than prograde ones .",
    "as @xmath102 increases the fraction of retrograde binaries decreases reaching a minimum of about @xmath104 for @xmath105 .",
    "this may be due to the keplerian sheer which increases the duration of a prograde encounter between unbound kbos compared to a retrograde encounter .",
    "the fraction of prograde and retrograde binaries becomes comparable for @xmath106 because for such binaries neither the keplerian sheer nor the increased stability of retrograde orbits are important .",
    "this is the relevant regime for binaries that form for @xmath26 since these large modified jacobi constants correspond to tight binaries , which are the only binaries that are saved from break up if super - hill velocities prevail .",
    "to date more than a dozen kbbs have well determined orbits ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . unfortunately due to projection effects ,",
    "the prograde and retrograde orbital solutions of the kbbs are nearly degenerate .",
    "this degeneracy can usually only be broken after several years once the viewing angle of the kbbs has changed sufficiently . very recently , after the submission of our original manuscript , two groups reported unique orbital solutions for kbbs typhon - echidna @xcite and @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "@xcite find a prograde orbit for typhon - echidna and @xcite report a retrograde orbit for @xmath107 .",
    "@xmath107 has such a large binary separation that , even in the current kuiper belt , it experiences significant dynamical interactions with other large kbos .",
    "it is early to draw conclusions for the whole binary population , but if a comparable number of retrograde and prograde binaries is found it would imply that kbbs formed from a dispersion dominated kbo disk , which would also be consistent with observed binary inclinations .",
    "dispersion dominated kbo velocities would imply that the value of @xmath108 was larger during binary formation than what we used in equation [ e3 ] .",
    "however , the velocity dispersion during binary formation can not have exceeded @xmath18 significantly since the binary formation timescales would otherwise become excessively long @xcite .",
    "the relative abundance of prograde to retrograde orbits enables us to differentiate between various proposed binary formation scenarios observationally .",
    "we predict that the vast majority ( @xmath95 % ) of comparable mass ratio binaries will have retrograde orbits if kbo velocities of @xmath109 prevailed during their formation . this dominance of retrograde over prograde binary orbits is due to the fact that for sub - hill velocities binaries form primarily via the @xmath0 mechanism instead of @xmath1 mechanism .",
    "since dynamical friction only gradually increases the modified jacobi constant , all binaries that form via the @xmath0 mechanism , or any other mechanism that dissipates little energy over an orbital timescale , will start with modified jacobi constants close to that of unbound kbos .",
    "only stable retrograde orbits exist for modified jacobi constants similar to that of kbos with initially circular orbits around the sun that penetrate inside the hill sphere .",
    "therefore , kbbs have retrograde orbits provided that they form from dynamically cold kbos via the @xmath0 mechanism",
    ".    as the kbo velocities approach @xmath18 the preference of retrograde orbits decreases .",
    "further , we predict a comparable number of prograde and retrograde binaries form for super - hill kbo velocities .",
    "this is because only the @xmath1 mechanism can form tight binaries that tend to survive if super hill velocities prevail @xcite .",
    "the fact that retrograde orbits are stable for larger semi - major axes is no longer of importance since only tight binaries tend to survive .",
    "this therefore leads to the formation of a roughly equal number of prograde and retrograde binaries for super - hill kbo velocities .",
    "the analysis presented here has also implications for some of the other proposed binary formation scenarios .",
    "@xcite suggested that kbbs form by a collision among two kbos inside the hill sphere of a third .",
    "although the @xmath1 mechanism dominates over such a collisional binary formation scenario we briefly discuss our predictions for this collisional binary formation mechanism . for sub - hill velocities more retrograde than prograde binaries form because retrograde binary orbits are stable further out in the hill sphere than prograde ones ( i.e. the phase space for forming retrograde binaries is larger than that for prograde binaries ) . for super - hill velocities a comparable number of prograde and retrograde binaries form because the fact that retrograde orbits are stable for larger semi - major axes is no longer of importance since only tight binaries are saved from break up . in the formation scenario of @xcite",
    "the existence of long lived transient binaries that spend a long time in their mutual hill sphere , near a periodic orbit , is responsible for the creation of kbbs .",
    "@xcite find an excess of prograde over retrograde binaries and suggest that this is a signature of their binary formation process .",
    "our work indicates that an excess of prograde over retrograde binaries might simply be the result of the velocity regime ( i.e.@xmath110 ) in which the binaries form ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "all of the above predictions rely on the assumption that subsequent orbital evolution due to dynamical friction and dynamical stirring of the kuiper belt did not alter the sense of the binary orbit . the kuiper belt has undergone a phase of dynamical excitation which probably modified the orbital properties of kbbs",
