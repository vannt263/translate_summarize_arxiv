    "in special relativity one knows three types of particles , tardyons ( subluminal ) , light - like and tachyons ( superluminal ) .",
    "the first two types of particles are of our world , inside the light - cone , while the tachyons seems to live in another one , outside the light - cone .",
    "these two worlds seems to be completely separated as long as there are no direct physical evidences about the tardyon - tachyon interactions . for this reason the tachyons are the most attractive hypothetical objects for speculating in some domain in physics where we have serious difficulties in building coherent theories .",
    "we mention , as an example , the presumed role of the tachyons in the early brane cosmology @xcite .",
    "however , here we do not intend to comment on this topics , restricting ourselves to analyze , from the mathematical point of view , the possibility to meet classical or quantum scalar or dirac tachyons on the de sitter backgrounds .",
    "the de sitter manifold , denoted from now by @xmath0 , is local - minkowskian such that the tachyons can be defined as in special relativity , with the difference that their properties are arising now from the specific high symmetry of the de sitter manifolds .",
    "it is known that the isometry group of @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath1 , is in fact the gauge group of the minkowskian five - dimensional manifold @xmath2 embedding @xmath0 .",
    "the unitary irreducible representations of the corresponding group @xmath3 are well - studied @xcite and used in various applications .",
    "many authors exploited this high symmetry for building theories of quantum fields , either by constructing symmetric two - point functions , avoiding thus the canonical quantization @xcite , or by using directly these unitary representations for finding field equations but without considering covariant representations @xcite .",
    "another approach which applies the canonical quantization to the covariant fields transforming according to induced covariant representations was initiated by nachtmann @xcite many years ago and continued in few of our papers @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we would like to study the tachyons on @xmath0 in this last framework by using the traditional definition of tachyons as particles of real squared masses but of opposite sigs with respect to the tadyonic ones .",
    "for this reason our results are different from other approaches @xcite where particles whose squared masses are supposed to be complex numbers are considered as tachyon @xcite . thus we find a result that seems to be somewhat paradoxical , namely that the classical tachyons can not exist on @xmath0 at any time while the quantum scalar and dirac particles behaves normally on this manifold , without any restriction .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the geodesics depending on a parameter giving their types ( tardyonic , tachyonic or light - like ) and",
    "we argue why the tachyonic lifetime is restricted on @xmath0 .",
    "the next section is devoted to the quantum scalar and dirac tachyons whose theory does not meet difficulties such that the mode functions are defined correctly as tempered distributions on the entire space at any moment .",
    "finally , we present the principal conclusion concerning the discrepancy between the classical and quantum cases .",
    "the de sitter spacetime @xmath0 is defined as the hyperboloid of radius @xmath4 the hubble de sitter constant since @xmath5 is reserved for the energy operator ] in the five - dimensional flat spacetime @xmath6 of coordinates @xmath7 ( labeled by the indices @xmath8 ) and metric @xmath9 .",
    "the local charts @xmath10 can be introduced on @xmath11 giving the set of functions @xmath12 which solve the hyperboloid equation , @xmath13 here we use the chart @xmath14 with the conformal time @xmath15 and cartesian spaces coordinates @xmath16 defined by @xmath17 \\nonumber\\\\ z^i(x)&=&-\\frac{1}{\\omega t}x^i \\ , , \\label{zx}\\\\ z^4(x)&=&-\\frac{1}{2\\omega^2 t}\\left[1+\\omega^2({t}^2 - \\vec{x}^2)\\right ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this chart covers the expanding portion , @xmath18 , of @xmath0 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 while the collapsing part , @xmath21 , is covered by a similar chart but with @xmath22 .",
    "both these charts have the conformal flat line element , @xmath23 we remind the reader that on each portion one can introduce a chart of proper time defined as , @xmath24 such that this spans the whole real axis , @xmath25 , on each portion .    by definition ,",
    "the de sitter spacetime @xmath0 is a homogeneous space of the pseudo - orthogonal group @xmath26 which is in the same time the gauge group of the metric @xmath27 and the isometry group , @xmath28 , of @xmath0 .",
    "the classical conserved quantities as well as the basis - generators of the covariant representations of the isometry group can be calculated with the help of the killing vectors @xmath29 which have the following components : @xmath30 where @xmath31\\,.\\ ] ]    furthermore , it is a simple exercise to integrate the geodesic equations and to find the conserved quantities on a geodesic trajectory on @xmath0 . using the standard notation",
    "@xmath32 we bear in mind that the principal invariant @xmath33 along the geodesics @xmath34 determines the type of this trajectory , i. e. tardyonic ( @xmath35 ) , light - like ( @xmath36 ) or tachyonic ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "all the other conserved quantities along the geodesics are proportional to @xmath38 and can be derived by using the killing vectors ( [ chichi1 ] ) and ( [ chichi2 ] ) .",
    "we assume first that in the chart @xmath39 the particle of mass @xmath40 has the conserved momentum @xmath41 of components @xmath42 so that we can write @xmath43 using the notation @xmath44 .",
    "hereby we deduce the trajectory , @xmath45 of a massive particle passing through the point @xmath46 at time @xmath47 .",
    "the light - like case must be treated separately finding that the trajectory of a massless particle reads @xmath48 where the unit vector @xmath49 gives the propagation direction .     and either @xmath50 on @xmath18 ( left panel ) or @xmath51 on @xmath21 ( right panel ) .",
    "the solid lines represent the light - cones which tends asymptoticly to the event horizon at @xmath52 . ]    among the conserved quantities that can be derived as in ref .",
    "@xcite the energy of the massive particles , @xmath53 indicates the allowed domains of our parameters .",
    "thus we see that the tardyonic particles can have any momentum , @xmath54 , since their energies remain always real numbers .",
    "when the tardyonic particle is at rest , staying in @xmath55 with @xmath56 , then we find the same rest energy @xmath57 as in special relativity .",
    "thus we conclude that the tardyonic particles behave familiarly just as in minkowski flat spacetime",
    ".    however , the tachyons have a new and somewhat strange behavior . when @xmath37 there are real trajectories only for large momentum with @xmath58 , corresponding to the superluminal motion .",
    "moreover , we must have @xmath59 which means that @xmath47 satisfies either the condition @xmath60 on @xmath18 or the symmetric one @xmath61 on @xmath21 .",
    "thus we conclude that a classical tachyon of momentum @xmath62 can exist on the expanding portion only in the time domain @xmath63 while on the collapsing portion its time domain is @xmath64 .",
    "the corresponding time domains of the tachyons with momentum @xmath62 in the charts of proper time are now @xmath65 on @xmath18 and @xmath66 on @xmath21 . in fig .",
    "( 1 ) we represent the worldlines in terms of the proper time with the initial conditions read @xmath67 at @xmath68 for which @xmath69 on both the portions of @xmath0 .",
    "these restrictions upon the tachyonic lifetime are quite unusual opening the problem of finding a plausible mechanism explaining the tachyon death on @xmath18 or how this is born on @xmath21 .",
    "the next step is to verify if similar restrictions could could arise in the case of the quantum fields too . for this purpose",
    "we have to analyse the tachyonic solutions of the scalar and dirac fields in momentum representation .",
    "the specific feature of the quantum mechanics on @xmath0 is that the energy operator does not commute with the components of the momentum operator .",
    "therefore , the energy and momentum can not be measured simultaneously with a desired accuracy .",
    "consequently , there are no particular solutions of the klein - gordon or dirac equations with well - determined energy and momentum , being forced to consider different plane waves solutions depending either on momentum or on energy and momentum direction . in what follows we restrict ourselves to the plane waves of determined momentum .      in an arbitrary chart @xmath70 the action of a charged scalar field @xmath71 of mass @xmath72 ,",

    "this action gives rise to the kg equation @xmath76+\\epsilon m^2\\phi=0\\,,\\ ] ] whose solutions have to be normalized ( in generalized sense ) with respect to the relativistic scalar product @xcite , @xmath77 written with the notation @xmath78 .    in the chart @xmath14 we use here",
    "the klein - gordon equation takes the form , @xmath79 the solutions of this equation may be square integrable functions or tempered distributions with respect to the scalar product ( [ sp1 ] ) that for @xmath80 takes the form @xmath81    it is known that the kg equation ( [ kg1 ] ) of np can be analytically solved in terms of bessel functions @xcite .",
    "there are fundamental solutions of positive frequencies and given momentum , @xmath41 , that read @xmath82 where @xmath83 are hankel functions , @xmath84 and we denote @xmath85 obviously , the fundamental solutions of negative frequencies are @xmath86 .",
    "now we observe that the only parameter depending on @xmath75 is just that given by eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) which encapsulates the information about the nature of the scalar particle .",
    "we observe first that there are no major differences between the tardyonic ( @xmath35 ) and tachyonic ( @xmath37 ) cases .",
    "the only property depending on the particle s nature is the behavior of the mode functions in the limit of @xmath87 , when the proper time tends to @xmath88 on @xmath18 or to @xmath89 on @xmath21 as in eq .",
    "( [ ttpr ] ) .",
    "the functions ( [ fp ] ) are finite in the considered limit only if we have @xmath90 which holds only for @xmath35 .",
    "thus we find that the tardyonic mode functions remain finite for @xmath87 while the tachyonic ones diverge in this limit .    however , this is not an impediment as long as the conserved scalar product and the conserved quantities do not depend explicitly on the functions giving the time modulation .",
    "tus we can say that the quantum scalar tachyons may live on @xmath0 at any time .",
    "the tardyonic free dirac field @xmath91 of mass @xmath72 and minimally coupled to the gravity of @xmath0 has the action @xmath92=\\int d^4 x\\sqrt{g}\\ , \\left({\\cal l}_d(\\psi)-m\\overline{\\psi}\\psi\\right)\\,.\\ ] ] where the massless lagrangian density , @xcite , @xmath93\\,,\\quad \\overline{\\psi}=\\psi^+\\gamma^0\\,,\\ ] ] depends on the covariant derivatives in local frames , @xmath94 @xcite , that guarantee the tetrad - gauge invariance .",
    "the point - independent dirac matrices @xmath95 satisfy @xmath96 giving rise to the basis - generators @xmath97/4 $ ] of the spinor representation @xmath98 of the @xmath99 group that induces the spinor covariant representations @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian theory of the dirac tachyons @xcite allows us to introduce our parameter @xmath75 for studying simultaneously the tardyonic , neutrino and tachyonic cases .",
    "this can be done on a natural way considering the new action @xmath100=\\int d^4 x\\sqrt{g}\\,\\left[{\\cal l}_d(\\psi_l)+\\epsilon{\\cal l}_d(\\psi_r)-\\epsilon m(\\overline{\\psi}_l\\psi_r+\\overline{\\psi}_r\\psi_l)\\right]\\,,\\ ] ] depending on the chiral projections @xmath101 and @xmath102 given by the standard projectors @xmath103 note that this action is written in the style of the standard model such that the left - handed term is independent on @xmath75 in order to do not affect the @xmath104 gauge symmetry .",
    "the action ( [ se ] ) gives the field equations of the massive fields , @xmath105 while for @xmath36 we recover the usual theory of the massless neutrino .",
    "it is remarkable that these equations are related through @xmath106 where the unitary matrix @xmath107 has the properties @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "this means that it is enough to solve the tardyonic equation for finding simultaneously the tachyonic solution by using eq .",

    "the normalization constant @xmath125 has to be calculated according to a normalization condition on @xmath18 that will not be discussed here .",

    "these fundamental spinors are definite on the whole expanding portion without restrictions despite of their complicated form . on the collapsing portion",
    "we meet similar solutions but with @xmath126 .",
    "we note that , as in the scalar case , there are mode functions that diverge in the limit of @xmath87 but only for the tachyonic mass @xmath129 while for @xmath130 these functions remain finite as in the tardyonic case .",
    "this situation is different from the scalar case where all the tachyonic scalar functions are divergent in this limit .",
    "however , this phenomenon has no physical consequences since only the conserved quantities ( scalar products and expectation values ) have physical significance .",
    "thus we can say that the dirac tachyons on the de sitter background have fundamental solutions well - defined on the entire physical space at any moment .",
    "finally , we must stress that the tachyon physics on the de sitter manifold seems to lead to a fundamental contradiction between the classical and quantum cases .",
    "thus in the classical approach the trajectory must end when the energy becomes imaginary . on the contrary ,",
    "in the quantum theory there are no time restrictions upon the mode functions that behave as tempered distributions on the whole physical space at any moment .",
    "the present paper is unable to solve this discrepancy since this presents the tachyonic solutions without studying the conserved quantities which could offer new arguments in what concerns the relation between the classical and quantum tachyons .",
