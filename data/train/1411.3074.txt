    "the qed effect of spontaneous pair creation of electron - positron pairs by a strong electric field was conceived by sauter as early as 1931 @xcite and computed by schwinger in 1951 for the constant field case @xcite .",
    "considerable work has gone into developing techniques for the calculation of this effect for more realistic electric field configurations @xcite , in particular such as can be realized by laser fields ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this effort , a special role",
    "is played by the case of a purely time - dependent field .",
    "this is because , although even here analytic results can not be expected in the generic case , a formalism exists that allows one to compute the pair creation rate numerically in a straightforward manner .",
    "what makes the purely time - dependent case very special is that for such a field the spatial momentum @xmath3 is a good quantum number .",
    "thus one can fix it , and use a bogoliubov transformation between the vacua at initial time and time @xmath4 to derive an evolution equation for the density of pairs @xmath5 with fixed momenta .",
    "this is the quantum vlasov equation ( ` qve ' ) . in the scalar qed case , which we will consider in this paper , the qve",
    "is usually written in the form @xcite",
    "@xmath6    where @xmath7 is the total energy squared ,    @xmath8    here the temporal gauge @xmath9 , @xmath10 has been used .",
    "the field points into a fixed direction , and @xmath11 denotes the canonical three - momentum component along the field .",
    "@xmath5 is usually taken to be zero initially , that is at @xmath12 , and for @xmath13 turns into the density of created pairs with fixed momentum @xmath3 .",
    "this interpretation has been shown to be consistent with various other approaches to the time - dependent schwinger problem , such as the one - loop effective action @xcite , the quantum mechanical scattering approach @xcite and the wigner formalism @xcite . from a practical point of view , although the structure of ( [ inout ] ) is not promising for attempts at exact analytical solution , it is amenable to numerical evaluation , as well as to other approximation schemes @xcite .",
    "sometimes it is preferable to use the following equivalent system of first - order differential equations @xcite    @xmath14    where @xmath15 are two auxiliary functions .",
    "as has been emphasized in @xcite , no direct physical meaning should be ascribed to @xmath5 at intermediate times , due to its dependence on the choice of an instantaneous adiabatic basis .",
    "this implies a large ambiguity which one can try to use for the construction of simpler , but physically equivalent evolution equations . in @xcite two of the authors",
    "obtained , also using a bogoliubov transformation but in a form inspired by lewis - riesenfeld theory @xcite , the following alternative evolution equation ( see also the recent @xcite for a systematic approach to the construction of a mathematically optimized adiabatic basis )    @xmath16 .",
    "\\label{inin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath17 at @xmath18 as before , and    @xmath19    where    _ * k*i : = _ t-_*k*(t ) .",
    "[ defomegaminusinf ] thus we have to assume in the following that this limit is finite , and similarly also    _ * k*f : = _ t+ _ * k*(t ) .",
    "[ defomegaplusinf ] however , this is a minor restriction since , for electric fields that vanish sufficiently fast at @xmath20 , it can always be achieved in a suitable gauge .",
    "note that , in contrast to the coefficient functions appearing in the `` standard '' vlasov equation ( [ inout ] ) , the coefficient functions @xmath21 do not involve square roots of time - dependent quantities .    for the `` alternative '' vlasov equation",
    ", two equivalent differential equations were obtained in @xcite .",
    "the first one is a system of first - order differential equations analogous to ( [ dglinout ] ) ,    @xmath22    the second one is the following linear third order linear differential equation    @xmath23    where the relation between @xmath24 and @xmath25 is given by ( here and in the following we often drop the subscript @xmath3 )    @xmath26    ( our @xmath27 corresponds to @xmath28 in @xcite ) .    for the alternative vlasov equation , an interesting set of explicit solutions could be found in terms of the well - known solitons of the korteweg - de vries equation @xcite .",
    "mathematically the two evolution equations ( [ inout ] ) and ( [ inin ] ) are clearly not equivalent , and it remained an open problem to elucidate the physical relation between them .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to show that the difference between them corresponds precisely to the one between the `` in - in '' and `` in - out '' formalisms .",
    "this will also allow us to find a simple relation between the asymptotic distribution functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 . we carry this through in chapters [ sec : inout ] and",
    "[ sec : inin ] .",
    "as examples , in chapter [ sec : examples ] we discuss the sauter and single - soliton field cases .",
    "in this chapter we will verify explicitly that the `` standard '' vlasov equation corresponds to the `` in - out '' formalism .",
    "the argument essentially follows @xcite .",
    "the basic equation underlying both evolutions equations is the classical mode equation    @xmath31    assuming that @xmath32 fulfills the mode equation ( [ mod eq ] ) , then    \\(t ) : = - [ relnphi ] solves the vlasov equation ( [ inout ] ) .",
    "this can be verified most directly by plugging @xmath33 into the equivalent differential equation ( [ dglinout ] ) , where the two auxiliary functions @xmath34 are given by    @xmath35 \\equiv \\phi ( t ) \\dot{\\phi}^ * ( t ) - \\phi^ * ( t ) \\dot{\\phi } ( t ) = i \\label{wronski}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which gives     eliminate @xmath36 we obtain the simple expression    _ & = & |a_|^2 + [ ninfty ] for the final density of created pairs ( at fixed momentum @xmath37 ) .",
    "we will now proceed analogously for the alternative vlasov equation ( [ inin ] ) . here",
    "the analogue of ( [ relnphi ] ) , that is , an explicit solution of ( [ inin ] ) in terms of the solution of the mode equation ( [ mod eq ] ) , turns out to be    \\(t ) = - [ reltildenphi ] as can again be verified simply by plugging into the differential equation system ( [ dglinin ] ) .",
    "the auxiliary functions @xmath38 are now given by    @xmath39 \\vspace{42pt } \\center{\\includegraphics[width=7.0cm]{fig - sautercompare.pdf } } \\caption{a comparison of $ { \\cal n}(t)$ ( damped oscillating blue curve ) against $ \\tilde{\\cal n}(t)$ ( oscillating red curve ) for the timelike sauter field . }",
    "\\label{fig_sautercompare } \\end{figure }     our second example is a `` solitonic '' electric field . in \\cite{84,kim }",
    "it had been shown that an infinite set of special solutions to the alternative vlasov equation can be explicitly constructed using the well - known soliton solutions of the korteweg - de - vries equation .",
    "the simplest one of these field configurations is given by     \\begin{eqnarray } qa(t ) = k_{\\parallel } - \\sqrt{k_{\\parallel}^2 + \\frac{2\\omega_0 ^ 2}{\\cosh^2(\\omega_0 t ) } } \\label{defasoliton}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where again @xmath40 .",
    "the solitonic character of the associated solutions shows itself in the property that @xmath41 for the @xmath3 used in the definition of the field ( [ defasoliton ] ) .",
    "this does not mean that such an electric field does not pair - create at all , but it can be tuned not to pair - create at a given momentum .",
    "the solution to the mode equation obeying ( [ condin ] ) is @xcite    \\(t ) = .",
    "[ phisoliton ] plugging this into ( [ relnphi ] ) reps .",
    "( [ reltildenphi ] ) gives    @xmath42    in fig .",
    "[ fig_solitoncompare ] we show a plot of both functions @xmath43 .",
    "note the simplicity of @xmath44 , the symmetry with respect to @xmath45 , the absence of oscillations and the vanishing of both functions for @xmath13 .",
    "( double peaked blue curve ) against @xmath44 ( single peaked red curve ) for the simplest solitonic field.,width=226 ]",
    "we have clarified here the relation of the vlasov equation for the creation of scalar pairs by time - dependent fields , recently proposed in @xcite , to the older and widely used one of @xcite .",
    "the difference between both equations boils down to a projection on final states with initial vs. final frequencies , that is , just to the distinction between the `` in - in '' vs. the `` in - out '' formalisms .",
    "if the initial and final frequencies are equal , @xmath46 , the asymptotic pair production rates coincide .",
    "this is the case , in particular , for the family of `` solitonic '' fields found in @xcite .",
    "thus the property of the associated solutions of the alternative vlasov equation to have a vanishing asymptotic pair creation rate is shared by the corresponding solutions of the standard vlasov equation .",
    "if @xmath47 the latter equation is , as the in - out one , the appropriate one in the context of laboratory experiments ( the in - in formalism figures prominently in cosmology , see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in any case , with the transformation formula ( [ trafo ] ) in hand both equations can be used equivalently according to mathematical convenience .",
