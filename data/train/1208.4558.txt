    "apart from demonstrating that neutrinos are massive and have non - vanishing mixing angles among the different generations @xcite , neutrino oscillation experiments have also proved that lepton flavor is not conserved in the neutral lepton sector .",
    "once the standard model is extended to account for neutrino masses  unavoidably  lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) also takes place in the charged lepton sector .",
    "this , however , not necessarily implies that these effects are sizable , so whether these processes can or not have measurable rates depends to a large extent on the details of the corresponding model .",
    "despite this fact , from a general point of view , charged lepton flavor violating processes are expected to have large decay branching fractions as long as the lfv mediators have @xmath2 masses and their couplings to the standard model leptons are about @xmath3 .",
    "majorana neutrino masses can be generated in a model independent way by adding the dimension - five effective operator @xmath4 to the standard model lagrangian @xcite . and",
    "in turn the different concrete realizations of this operator constitute a model for neutrino masses . among the tree - level realizations the type - i seesaw is certainly the most popular one @xcite . in this model ,",
    "light neutrino masses are generated via the exchange of electroweak fermionic singlets ( right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos for brevity ) .",
    "consistency with neutrino data then requires either heavy rh neutrino masses ( @xmath5 ) or tiny yukawa couplings ( @xmath6 ) , thus implying negligibly small charged lepton flavor violating effects .",
    "in addition to the standard model gauge symmetry the seesaw lagrangian features a global abelian @xmath0 symmetry , typically related with phase rotations of the standard model lepton @xmath7 singlets , and thus broken by the charged lepton yukawa couplings . however , relating this symmetry with phase rotations of the rh leptons fields is not the only possibility , and another approach in which rotations of the left - handed lepton fields and rh neutrinos are allowed is feasible as well . in that case one",
    "is left with ( at least ) two choices : ( @xmath8 ) slightly broken @xmath0 ; ( @xmath9 ) @xmath10 invariance of the lagrangian .    in what follows",
    "we will consider possibility ( @xmath8 ) . in the context of minimal seesaw models ( models featuring only 2 rh neutrinos )",
    "we will classify the viable scenarios arising from different @xmath1-charge assignments , that as we already discussed are not anymore limited to the rh leptons , and identify those models for which charged lepton flavor violating processes have sizable decay branching ratios .",
    "for these models we will analyze the @xmath11 flavor violating phenomenology .",
    "the results presented here are entirely based on ref .",
    "depending on the @xmath1-charge assignments of the different standard model and rh neutrino fields different models can be constructed . in order to restrict the discussion only to the lepton sector",
    "we start by setting @xmath12 . requiring the charged lepton yukawa couplings to be @xmath0 invariant allows to fix @xmath13 ( @xmath14 being the lepton electroweak singlets and doublets ) .",
    "we are thus left with the lepton doublets and rh neutrinos @xmath1-charge assignments .",
    "large lepton flavor violating rates require ( at least ) the rh neutrino mass terms to be @xmath0 breaking suppressed ( the suppression factor denoted by @xmath15 ) , implying @xmath16 and one of the following three possibilities : ( a ) @xmath17 ; ( b ) @xmath18 or ( c ) @xmath19 . in practice possibilities ( a ) and ( c ) turn out to be equivalent as they both lead to models with @xmath20 suppressed mixing and therefore to suppressed lfv effects .",
    "in contrast in case ( b ) the @xmath20 mixing is maximal and a set of yukawa couplings can be large provided the @xmath21 charges are chosen appropriately . in that sense models of type ( b ) are much more interesting as they might yield large lfv effects .    with the purpose of studying the implications for lfv of type b models we fix the @xmath1-charges as @xmath22 and @xmath23 . with this charge assignment",
    "the seesaw lagrangian becomes @xmath24 here @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the charge conjugation operator , @xmath27 with @xmath28 ( matrices are denoted in bold - face ) and @xmath29 are dimensionless parameters that slightly break @xmath0 .",
    "diagonalization of the rh neutrino mass matrix yields two quasi - degenerate states with masses @xmath30 after diagonalization the yukawa couplings read @xmath31\\ , ,    \\qquad ( k = e,\\mu,\\tau\\;\\;\\mbox{and}\\;\\ ; a=1,2)\\,,\\ ] ] and thus the light neutrino mass matrix is determined to be @xmath32 with @xmath33 note that the parameter space vectors have been expressed according to @xmath34 , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 are unitary vectors along the @xmath37 directions .",
    "due to the structure of the light neutrino matrix the parameter space vectors are  up to normalization factors  completely determined by neutrino mixing angles and masses .",
    "for the normal hierarchical spectrum they can be written according to @xcite : @xmath38 where the @xmath39 s correspond to the columns of the leptonic mixing matrix and @xmath40",
    "currently the most competitive bounds on charged lepton flavor violating processes are placed for @xmath11 decays , being @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 conversion in nuclei the ones with the most stringent upper limits @xcite .",
    "in addition it is for these processes that the most tight bounds are expected in near - future experimental proposals : meg @xcite , _ mu3e",
    "_ @xcite prism / prime @xcite .",

    "we now turn to the discussion of the @xmath44 process .",
    "this decay involves dipole contributions , @xmath61 and @xmath62 penguins as well as box diagrams @xcite , so a simple approximate formula as in the previous case does not exist . following the same numerical procedure than in the @xmath63 case",
