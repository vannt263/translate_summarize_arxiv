    "next generation communication systems aim at providing self - sustainability and high data rates to communication networks with guaranteed quality of service ( qos ) .",
    "a promising technique for prolonging the lifetime of communication networks is energy harvesting ( eh ) . among different eh technologies , wireless power transfer ( wpt ) via electromagnetic waves in radio frequency ( rf ) enables comparatively controllable eh at the receivers compared to conventional natural source , such as wind , solar , and tidal .",
    "recent progress in the development of rf - eh circuitries has made rf - eh practical for low - power consumption devices @xcite@xcite , e.g. wireless sensors .",
    "in particular , rf - eh enables simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) @xcite@xcite . thereby , as a carrier of both information and energy , the rf signal unifies information transmission and power transfer . besides , rf - eh advocates energy saving by recycling the energy in the rf radiated by ambient transmitters . in swipt systems , the amount of harvested energy is an equally important qos metric as the data rate and the transmit power consumption which are traditionally considered in communication networks .",
    "thus , resource allocation algorithms for swipt systems should also take into account the emerging need for energy transfer @xcite@xcite . in @xcite , energy - efficient swipt was investigated in multicarrier systems , where power allocation , user scheduling , and subcarrier allocation were considered . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed a power allocation scheme for energy efficiency maximization of large scale multiple - antenna swipt systems . in @xcite , multi - objective optimization ( moo )",
    "was applied to jointly optimize multiple system design objectives to facilitate secure swipt systems .",
    "although swipt has been already considered for various system setups , the power efficiency of swipt systems @xcite@xcite , has not been fully investigated and is still unsatisfactory due to the traditional half - duplex ( hd ) operation .",
    "recently , full - duplex ( fd ) communication has become a viable option for next generation wireless communication networks .",
    "in contrast to conventional hd transmission , fd communication allows devices to transmit and receive simultaneously on the same frequency , thus potentially doubling the spectral efficiency . in practice , the self - interference ( si ) caused by the own transmit signal impairs the simultaneous signal reception in fd systems severely which has been a major obstacle for the implementation of fd devices in the past decades .",
    "fortunately , breakthroughs in analog and digital self - interference cancellation ( sic ) techniques @xcite have made fd communication more practical in recent years . however , various practical implementation issues , such as protocol and resource allocation algorithm design , need to be reinvestigated in the context of fd communications @xcite@xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed a suboptimal beamformer design to maximize the spectral efficiency of fd small cell wireless systems . in @xcite ,",
    "resource allocation and scheduling was studied for fd multiple - input multiple - output orthogonal frequency division multiple access ( mimo - ofdma ) relaying systems . moreover",
    ", the energy efficiency of fd - ofdma relaying systems was investigated in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite proposed a multi - objective resource allocation algorithm for fd systems by considering the trade - off between uplink and downlink transmit power minimization .",
    "although fd communication has drawn significant research interest @xcite@xcite , research on fd swipt systems is still in its infancy . lately",
    ", the notion of fd communication in eh systems has been pursued .",
    "specifically , the combination of fd and wpt was first considered in @xcite .",
    "the authors optimized the resource allocation in a system with wpt in the downlink and wireless information transmission in the uplink . in @xcite , the performance of a dual - hop full - duplex relaying swipt system",
    "was studied .",
    "however , simultaneous uplink and downlink communication has not been studied thoroughly for swipt systems .",
    "in fact , uplink and downlink transmission occurs simultaneously in fd systems and the associated information signals can also serve as vital energy sources for rf energy harvesting . as a result , different trade - off naturally arise in fd - swipt systems when considering the aspects of uplink and downlink transmission as well as eh .",
    "these observations motivate us to design a flexible resource allocation algorithm for fd swipt systems which strikes a balance between the different system design objectives .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sect : ofdma_af_network_model ] , we outline the system model for the considered fd swipt networks . in section [ sect : forumlation ] , we formulate the multi - objective resource allocation algorithm design as a non - convex optimization problem and solve this problem by semidefinite programming relaxation .",
    "in section [ sect : simulation ] , we present numerical performance results for the proposed optimal algorithm . in section [",

    "the system consists of an fd radio base station ( bs ) , @xmath24 hd downlink users , @xmath25 hd uplink users , and @xmath26 roaming users , cf . figure [ fig : system_model ] .",
    "the bs is equipped with @xmath27 antennas that can simultaneously perform downlink transmission and uplink reception in the same frequency band @xcite .",
    "all uplink and downlink users are single - antenna devices to limit the hardware complexity . on the other hand , to facilitate efficient eh , we assume that the roaming users are multiple - antenna devices , which are equipped with @xmath28 antennas .    for downlink fd communication ,",
    "@xmath24 independent signal streams are transmitted simultaneously at the same frequency to the @xmath24 downlink users .",

    "without loss of generality , we assume @xmath32 . besides",

    "the energy signal @xmath35 is modeled as a complex pseudo - random sequence with covariance matrix @xmath36 . in general ,",
    "both pseudo - random signals and constant amplitude signals are potential candidates for implementing the energy signal .",

    ". this seed information is known at the downlink users .",
    "thus , the interference caused by the energy signal can be completely cancelled at the downlink users before decoding the desired signals .",

    "vector @xmath48 represents the awgn distributed as @xmath49 . due to the concurrent uplink reception and downlink transmission at the fd radio bs ,",
    "the si caused by the downlink transmit signal impairs the uplink signal reception . in practice ,",
    "different interference mitigation techniques such as antenna cancellation , balun cancellation , and circulators @xcite have been proposed to alleviate the impairment caused by si . in order to isolate the resource allocation algorithm design from the specific implementation of self - interference mitigation",
    ", we model the self - interference cancellation induced noise by vector @xmath50 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 4 ) ) , where @xmath51 is the self - interference channel and @xmath52 is a constant indicating the noisiness of the self - interference cancellation at the fd bs .",
    "in the considered system , both downlink and uplink signals act as energy sources to the roaming users ( energy harvesters ) . the received signal at energy harvester @xmath53 is @xmath54 where matrix @xmath55 and vector @xmath56 denote the channel between the bs and energy harvester @xmath57 , and the channel between uplink user @xmath41 and energy harvester @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "vector @xmath58 represents the awgn at energy harvester @xmath57 distributed as @xmath59 .",
    "we note that all channel variables , i.e. , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , capture the joint effect of path loss and small scale fading .",
    "in this section , we first introduce the adopted qos metrics .",
    "then , from the perspectives of uplink power consumption , downlink power consumption , and eh , we formulate three single objective optimization problems . in practice , these three system design objectives are all desirable but conflicting .",
    "thus , we apply a moo framework to study multi - objective resource allocation algorithm design .",
    "we assume that full channel state information ( csi ) is available at the fd bs for resource allocation .",
    "the receive signal - to - interference - plus - noise - ratio ( sinr ) at downlink user @xmath37 is given by @xmath66 where the interference from the energy beamforming signal , i.e. , @xmath67 , has already been cancelled since energy signal @xmath35 is known to the downlink users .    for uplink transmission , we adopt zero - forcing beamforming ( zf - bf ) for detection at the bs .",
    "in contrast to optimal minimum mean square error beamforming ( mmse - bf ) detection , zf - bf facilitates the design of resource allocation algorithms in the considered problem .",
    "additionally , the performance of zf - bf converges to the performance of mmse - bf in the high sinr regime @xcite , which is the desired operating region of the considered system .",
    "therefore , the receive sinr at the bs with respect to uplink user @xmath68 can be expressed as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the noise caused by si cancellation and @xmath71 denotes the zf - bf receive vector for decoding the signal of uplink user @xmath41 .",
    "the zf - bf matrix is given by @xmath72^t=(\\mathbf{g}^h\\mathbf{g})^{-1}\\mathbf{g}^h,\\\\ \\text{where}\\quad\\mathbf{g}&=&[\\mathbf{g}_1,\\dots,\\mathbf{g}_m].\\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    on the other hand , the total amount of harvested energy at energy harvester @xmath53 is given by @xmath73,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the energy conversion efficiency of energy harvester @xmath57 .",
    "it represents the energy loss in converting the received rf energy to electrical energy for storage .",
    "note that the thermal noise power is ignored in ( [ eqn : p_harv ] ) for eh as it is negligibly small compared to the power of the received signals .      in fd swipt systems ,",
    "downlink transmit power minimization , uplink transmit power minimization , and total harvested energy maximization are all desirable system design objectives .",
    "now , we first propose three single - objective optimization problems with respect to these objectives .",
    "_ downlink transmit power minimization:_[prob : dl_mino ] @xmath75    where @xmath76 and @xmath77 denote the downlink beamforming vector policy and the uplink transmit power policy , respectively . in , we minimize the total downlink transmit power by jointly optimizing downlink information beamforming vectors @xmath78 , the covariance matrix of energy signal , @xmath79 , and uplink transmit power @xmath80 .",
    "constants @xmath81 and @xmath82 in c1 and c2 denote the maximum downlink transmit power for the fd bs and the maximum transmit power of uplink user @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "qos requirements of reliable communication are taken into account in c3 and c4 .",
    "in particular , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the minimum required sinrs for the downlink and uplink users , respectively .",
    "@xmath85 in c5 is the minimum required amount of harvested energy for energy harvester @xmath57 .",
    "in addition , c6 and c7 enforce the non - negative uplink transmit power constraints and the positive semidefinite hermitian matrix constraint for covariance matrix @xmath79 , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , for the system designs with the objectives of uplink transmit power minimization and total harvested energy maximization , respectively , we have the same constraint set as for problem 1 .",
    "therefore , the problem formulations for these two other system design objectives are given as , respectively ,    _ uplink transmit power minimization:_[prob : ul_mino ] @xmath86    _ total harvested energy maximization:_[prob : eh_maxo ] @xmath87    the interdependency between the aforementioned objectives is non - trivial in the considered fd swipt system .",
    "for instance , although a large transmit power ensures high received sinrs at the downlink users , the strong si impairs the reception of the uplink signals at the fd bs . similarly , increasing the uplink transmit power to satisfy a more stringent uplink sinr requirement will lead to severe cci which degrades the downlink signal reception . on the other hand , the eh qos requirement has to be fulfilled by transferring a sufficient amount of power in both uplink and downlink . yet , minimizing either uplink or downlink transmit power conflicts with the objective of having a higher power for eh .",
    "hence , a non - trivial trade - off between these three system design objectives naturally arises in the considered fd swipt system .",
    "thus , a flexible resource allocation algorithm which can accommodate diverse system design preferences is desired . to this end",
    ", we apply moo to systematically address this resource allocation problem .    in the literature ,",
    "moo is commonly adopted as a mathematical framework to study the trade - off between multiple desirable but conflicting system design objectives .",
    "the optimal solution of a moo program ( moop ) is defined by a pareto optimal set ; a set of points that satisfy the concept of pareto optimality @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we formulate a moop based on the weighted tchebycheff method @xcite , in which the preferences for the aforementioned single system design objectives are quantified by a set of pre - specified weights . in fact , compared to other approaches to formulate moops , the weighted tchebycheff method can provide a complete pareto optimal set by varying the weights , even if the moop is non - convex . for the sake of notational simplicity , we denote the objective functions of problems 13 as @xmath88 , @xmath89 , respectively . then , the moop is given by    _ multi - objective optimization:_[prob : mul_obj ] @xmath90    where @xmath91 is the optimal objective value with respect to problem @xmath89 . in order to represent the three single system design objective functions in a unified manner , without loss of generality , the maximization in problem [ prob : eh_maxo ] was rewritten as an equivalent minimization . as a result ,",
    "@xmath92 in problem [ prob : mul_obj ] is given by @xmath93 .",
    "constant @xmath94 is a weight imposed on the @xmath95-th objective function subject to @xmath96 and @xmath97 , which indicates the preference of the system designer for the @xmath95-th objective function over the others .",
    "we can obtain a set of resource allocation policies by solving problem [ prob : mul_obj ] for different predefined weights . in the extreme case , when @xmath98 and @xmath99 , problem [ prob : mul_obj ] is equivalent to the @xmath95-th single - objective optimization problem .",
    "problems [ prob : dl_mino]-[prob : mul_obj ] are non - convex optimization problems due to the non - convex constraints c3 and c4 . to overcome the non - convexity",
    ", we recast these problems as sdps via sdp relaxation . to this end",
    ", we define new variables @xmath100 thus , the considered problems can be equivalently transformed as follows :    [ prob : dl_mino_tf ]    @xmath101 where @xmath102,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath103 is the set of downlink beamforming matrices to be optimized .",
    "constraints c8 , c9 , and @xmath104 are introduced due to the definition of @xmath105 .",
    "similarly , problems 2 - 4 are equivalently transformed to    [ prob : ul_mino_tf ]    @xmath106    [ prob : eh_maxo_tf ]    @xmath107    [ prob : mul_obj_tf ] @xmath108    where @xmath109 is an an auxiliary optimization variable @xcite .    evidently , transformed problem [ prob : mul_obj_tf ] is a generalization of transformed problems [ prob : dl_mino_tf]-[prob : eh_maxo_tf ] . hence ,",
    "we focus on the methodology for solving transformed problem [ prob : mul_obj_tf ] in the following . transformed problem [ prob : mul_obj_tf ] is non - convex due to the rank - one matrix constraint c9 . to obtain a tractable problem formulation ,",
    "we apply sdp relaxation .",
    "specifically , we relax constraint c9 in ( [ eqn : mul_obj_tf ] ) by removing it from the problem . then , the considered problem becomes @xmath110 we note that the rank constraint relaxed problem in ( [ eqn : mul_obj_sdp ] ) is a convex sdp which can be solved by standard numerical convex program solvers such as cvx @xcite .",
    "in particular , if the obtained solution of the relaxed problem satisfies the rank - one constraint , i.e. , @xmath111 , then the solution of is the optimal solution of the original problem [ prob : mul_obj ] .",
    "thus , the optimal beamforming vector @xmath112 of the original problem can be retrieved by solving the relaxed problem .",
    "now , we reveal the tightness of the sdp relaxation by the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : rankone ] assuming that the channels @xmath64 , @xmath113 , and @xmath60 , are statistically independent , the optimal beamforming matrix for ( [ eqn : mul_obj_sdp ] ) is a rank - one matrix , i.e. , @xmath114 , and the energy beamforming matrix satisfies @xmath115 with probability one for @xmath116 .",
    "please refer to the appendix .",
    "in other words , whenever the channels satisfy the general condition stated in theorem [ thm : rankone ] , the adopted sdp relaxation is tight .",
    "hence , the optimal solution of the original moop can be obtained by solving the relaxed sdp problem in ( [ eqn : mul_obj_sdp ] ) . besides , information beamforming ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath117 , and energy beamforming , i.e. , @xmath115 , is optimal for optimizing the considered conflicting objective functions . on the other hand , the optimal solutions of the single - objective problems can be achieved by solving special cases of ( [ eqn : mul_obj_sdp ] ) .",
    "for instance , the solution of single - objective problem [ prob : dl_mino ] can be obtained by solving ( [ eqn : mul_obj_sdp ] ) with @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 .",
    "in this section , we investigate the performance of the proposed multi - objective resource allocation algorithm .",
    "the important simulation parameters are summarized in table [ table : parameters ] .",
    "we evaluate a system with an fd radio bs located at the center of a cell .",

    "the small scale fading of the uplink and downlink channels is modeled as independent and identically distributed rayleigh fading .",

    "the points shown for the trade - off region were obtained by solving the sdp relaxed problem for different sets of weights @xmath138 subject to @xmath97 . as can be seen , there is a nontrivial trade - off between uplink and downlink transmit power minimization and total harvested energy maximization . in particular , for a fixed weight @xmath139 for eh maximization , the downlink transmit power monotonically decreases for an increasing uplink transmit power which suggests that downlink transmit power minimization and uplink transmit power minimization conflict with each other . on the other hand , the objective of total harvested energy maximization does not align with the objectives of uplink and downlink transmit power minimization .",

    "<S> we propose a multi - objective optimization framework to study the trade - off between uplink transmit power minimization , downlink transmit power minimization , and total harvested energy maximization . </S>",
    "<S> the considered optimization framework takes into account heterogeneous quality of service requirements for uplink and downlink communication and wireless power transfer . </S>",
    "<S> the non - convex multi - objective optimization problem is transformed into an equivalent rank - constrained semidefinite program ( sdp ) and solved optimally by sdp relaxation under certain general conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of the proposed framework results in a set of pareto optimal resource allocation policies . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results unveil an interesting trade - off between the considered conflicting system design objectives and reveal the improved power efficiency facilitated by fd in swipt systems compared to traditional hd systems . </S>"
