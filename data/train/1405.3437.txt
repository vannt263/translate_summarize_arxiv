    "accretion in disks is generally thought to occur by the action of turbulence , for which the magnetorotational instability ( mri , * ? ? ? * ) is the most likely culprit . however , protoplanetary disks are cold ; the ionization level required to couple the gas to the ambient field is not always met @xcite , leading to zones that are `` dead '' to the mri @xcite .",
    "so , the quest for hydrodynamical sources of turbulence continues , if only to provide accretion through this dead zone .",
    "one such possible sources of hydrodynamical turbulence is the subcritical baroclinic instability ( sbi , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , a process shown to sustain large - scale vortices in the presence of a radial entropy gradient and thermal relaxation or diffusion . two - dimensional linear stability analysis and numerical simulations do not find instability if only seeded with linear noise @xcite , though it was shown that finite amplitude perturbations would trigger it , concluding that the instability is nonlinear in nature @xcite .",
    "characterization of the instability through nonlinear numerical simulations shows that maximum amplification is found for thermal times in the range of 110 times the dynamical timescale @xcite .",
    "although no criterion for a critical reynolds number was derived , @xcite show that as resolution is increased , ever smaller perturbations are necessary , as expected if the process is physical .",
    "compressible simulations @xcite show that the spiral density waves excited by the vortices @xcite transport angular momentum at the level of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the shakura - sunyaev parameter @xcite .",
    "if this process indeed occur in disks , it would provide not only accretion but also a fast route for planet formation in the dead zone , since vortices speed up the process enormously , by concentrating particles in their centers @xcite .",
    "the appeal of the sbi , however , is severely hindered by its nonlinear nature . without the guide of analytics ,",
    "nonlinear processes are difficult to characterize , and the accuracy of the numerics have to be well - established beyond reasonable doubts .",
    "recently , klahr & hubbard ( 2014 , hereafter kh14 ) have claimed that , when considering the same equations that lead to sbi in 2d , linear growth exists if vertical wavelengths are considered .",
    "the unstable mode is a slowly growing epicyclic oscillation , which led the authors to name the process `` convective overstability '' .",
    "growth is powered by buoyancy and thermal relaxation in the same regime as the sbi , of cooling time of the order of the dynamical time .",
    "we analyze this claim of linearity in more detail in this paper .",
    "independent verification is desirable since unorthodox assumptions were made in the linear analysis of kh14 . in particular",
    ", the authors assumed that the timescale for pressure equilibration is fast , and thus set the pressure perturbation to zero in the linear analysis .",
    "because of this strong assumption , skepticism about the validity of the work naturally remains until a rigorous derivation of the dispersion relation is provided , unambiguously demonstrating that the eigenvector of the growing root has no appreciable pressure term . in this work ,",
    "we provide such derivation .",
    "another point raised by kh14 is the connection between this overstability and the sbi , if any . a priori",
    ", the two processes have little to do with each other .",
    "however , as the regimes of cooling time for both are similar , if the convective overstability exists , it may generate the finite amplitude perturbations that trigger the sbi . in this scenario",
    ", the ( nonlinear ) sbi would simply be the saturated state of the ( linear ) convective overstability . since the difficulty on finding a source of finite amplitude perturbation in dead zones in the required range of cooling times had made the sbi look less attractive as a relevant disk process , a linear process that can spawn the sbi from arbitrarily low - level noise would be particularly interesting .",
    "conversely , there is the possibility , of course , that the saturated state of the convective overstability may still be of too low amplitude to trigger the sbi .",
    "we investigate these possibilities in the present study .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in sect 2",
    "we perform a linear analysis calculating the full compressible dispersion relation . in sect 3",
    "we take the anelastic limit to derive the instability criterion , finding the roots , the most unstable mode , and associated eigenvector . in sect 4",

    "we initialize the simulations with the eigenvector corresponding to the epicycle oscillation , @xmath124 . because for @xmath125 the growth rate does not depend on @xmath126 , we arbitrarily choose @xmath127 for the channel mode .",

    "[ fig : power ] the time evolution of the power in the first 5 large scale modes , in both @xmath118 ( upper middle panel ) and @xmath119 ( upper left panel ) .",
    "the upper left panel shows the rms of the radial velocity .",
    "four special / representative instants are labeled , and the @xmath141 field for these respective instants are shown in the lower panels .",
    "the first instant , @xmath35 , corresponds to the first `` saturation '' seen at 50 orbits .",
    "the power spectrum shows that the clean initial channel mode ( @xmath142=4 , @xmath143=0 ) persisted until this time , after which it saturates , exciting @xmath144 modes and other @xmath126 modes .",
    "instant @xmath36 , at 67 orbits , corresponds to the local minimum in rms velocity .",
    "the power spectrum shows that this happens when the @xmath142=1 mode becomes dominant .",
    "subsequently , this mode keeps growing , at the same rate as the initial @xmath142=4 mode .",
    "this is because the growth rate is independent of @xmath126 for @xmath125 , which at that time has similar power as the higher @xmath145 modes . from time",
    "@xmath146=90 ( instant @xmath147 ) to 160 orbits the system settles into a steady state , with a dominant @xmath142=1 mode , and mixed @xmath143=0 and @xmath143=1 .",
    "another bifurcation happens when the @xmath148 mode overtakes the @xmath142=1 mode .",
    "simultaneously , it prompts @xmath143=1 to dominate over @xmath125 .",
    "the final state ( labeled @xmath149 ) is thus vertically symmetric , with a box - wide radial wavelength .",
    "this explains why we do not find convergence while increasing box vertical range from @xmath150=@xmath151 to @xmath152 to @xmath153 . in these boxes , because we kept the seed mode at @xmath154 , we initialized the instability with the @xmath142=1 , 2 , and 4 mode , respectively . in the last two simulations ,",
    "the @xmath142=1 mode was growing , with less power , but eventually catching up as the seed mode saturates .",
    "convergence with radial box size is never achieved in the 2d runs because the @xmath155 mode comes to dominate , no matter how wide we make the box .",
    "the simulations with radial box size @xmath156 and @xmath157 show the same pattern , albeit with no intermediate phase of dominance of a @xmath142=1 mode .",
    "next we turn to the 3d evolution of the instability .",
    "we set a box of size @xmath158 , with resolution @xmath159 in @xmath118 , @xmath160 , and @xmath119 , respectively .",
    "the cells thus have aspect ratio @xmath161 ( we have checked in @xcite that unit aspect ratio in @xmath118 and @xmath160 gave the same results for the twodimensional sbi )",
    ".    with the azimuthal direction present , vertical vorticity ( in - plane circulation ) can evolve unabridged .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3d ] ( left panel ) the evolution of the rms velocity ( red line ) and enstrophy ( black line ) .",
    "when the initial @xmath126 mode saturates ( at 50 orbits , as in the 2d meridional models of fig 3 ) , a sharp rise in enstrophy occurs .",
    "the situation is now very similar to the sbi , with high - amplitude perturbations ( @xmath162 ) , thermal relaxation , and an entropy gradient .",
    "the nonlinear saturation state of this buoyant overstability should thus proceed very similarly to the evolution of the sbi . indeed , as the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3d ] show , the saturated state develops into a large scale vortex .",
    "the amount of angular momentum transport ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3d ] , upper right ) is at the @xmath163 level , again , the typical level of the sbi .",
    "it seems conclusive that the saturated state of the buoyant overstability is the sbi .",
    "we conclude that indeed there is a linear overstability in the region of the parameter space of negative @xmath164 , finite cooling time @xmath10 , and non - zero @xmath126 perturbation .",
    "the approximation @xmath165 done by kh14 is justified as @xmath165 ( and @xmath166 ) in the eigenvector of the most unstable modes is vanishingly small in comparison to the velocity amplitude ( eq .  [ eq : eigenvector ] ) .",
    "modeling the system numerically , we reproduce the linear growth rate in all cases . in the twodimensional meridional simulations , we find convergence in the saturated state with resolution , but not with box size , since a large - scale @xmath155 radial mode dominates the box .",
    "however , in three dimensions this mode does not show up , as it gets sheared away .",
    "we also show that the sbi is indeed the saturated state of the overstability .",
    "saturation leads to a fast burst of enstrophy in the box , and a large - scale vortex develops in the course of the next @xmath0100 orbits after the convective overstability has built the finite amplitude perturbations .",
    "the amount of angular momentum transport achieved is of the order of @xmath1 , as in compressible sbi models .",
    "it remains to be shown if these processes ( both sbi and convective overstability ) operate in global models , i.e. , how they respond to boundary conditions and curvature terms .",
    "the relation between this overstability and the goldreich - schubert - fricke instability @xcite should also be the subject of future work .",
    "this work was performed in part at the jet propulsion laboratory , under contract with the california institute of technology funded by the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) through the sagan fellowship program executed by the nasa exoplanet science institute .",
