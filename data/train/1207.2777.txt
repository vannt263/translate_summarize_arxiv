    "outer or external rings are typically large , low surface brightness features of barred and weakly barred galaxies , prominent at optical wavelengths . they are most frequently observed in early - type spirals ( s0/a ) and , as with gaseous rings and pseudorings , are most often believed to be associated with outer lindblad resonances ( buta & combes 1996 ) .",
    "these resonances are assumed to arise with bars or other pertubations ( see simulations by , e.g. , bagley et al .",

    "explanations vary from ring creation through tidal forcing via interactions with companions or bars that have since dissipated , to spiral density waves in the disk ( rautiainen & salo 2000 ) .",
    "there are also outer rings that presumably formed in collisions ( e.g. , appleton & struck - marcell 1996 ) or through prograde major mergers of gas - rich disk galaxies ( brook et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "outer rings can have major axes that are twice the size of the bar component ( schwarz 1981 ) and , therefore , they dominate the outer areas of the disks of the galaxies that contain them .",
    "the study of outer disks as a path to understanding galaxy evolution has had recent renewed interest due to the discovery of very extended disks at ultraviolet ( gil de paz 2005 ; thilker et al .",

    "this is not visible in the 70@xmath0 mips image , where the lower resolution smears these details .",
    "given the larger beam size of the mips instrument and the difference in the operating temperatures of the two telescopes , it was anticipated that the 70@xmath0 and 160@xmath0 mips images would be more sensitive to diffuse emission , such as in the outer disks of galaxies , by a factor of five for dust emission at t@xmath28k and by a factor of seven for dust emission at t@xmath29k for a similar number of passes by each instrument ( e.g. , hinz et al .",
    "figure 2 also shows a @xmath30 view , where the mips image has a faint detection of the ring at the northwestern and southeastern hotspots that pacs does not .",
    "this may be due to the intrinsic instrument differences as suggested above or due to the methods with which the pacs data are reduced currently .",
    "highpass filtering used during the production of the pacs maps by hipe may remove such diffuse features . using the scanamorphos software ( roussel et al .",

    "ngc1291 is not classified as an extended ultraviolet disk by thilker et al .",
    "( 2007 ) since the uv morphology is coincident with the optical morphology of the ring ; this coincidence implies that there is a more evolved stellar component in the ring in addition to the young stars .",
    "the ring in h@xmath7 and 24@xmath0 is very thin ( @xmath32 across at 24@xmath0 ) and is discontinuous , with discrete sources appearing mostly in arcs on the northwest and southeast sides of the galaxy .",
    "the uv images show many more star formation knots to the north and west of the main ring than the other wavelengths .    in a detailed study of hii regions in early - type ringed galaxies by crocker et al .",

    "these regions are filled with diffuse patterns of ionized gas filaments to a radius of @xmath33kpc , which is analogous to a pattern seen in the later type galaxy m31 ( ciardullo et al.1988 ) and m81 ( devereux et al .",
    "1995 ) , and assumed to be caused by the ejection of the ism via a galactic wind .",
    "the diffuse and unusual h@xmath7 emission and the hi observations , showing an outer ring with a pronounced central hole ( van driel et al .",
    "1988 ) , have led to supposition that there is little to no star formation in the central bulge ( hogg et al .",
    "however , we now see that the inner portion of the galaxy appears to be brighter compared to the ring at both h@xmath7 and 24@xmath0 , making it unlikely that there is no star formation occurring centrally .",
    "global star formation rate estimates for ngc1291 differ slightly with method .",

    "2007 ) . for the aperture between @xmath21 and @xmath23 that contains only the ring ,",
    "the nuv magnitude is 15.1 , which translates to a log star formation rate ( m@xmath11yr@xmath17 ) = -0.52 , following donovan et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , who use a relation from kennicutt ( 1998 ) for a similar early - type galaxy with an ultraviolet ring .",
    "given the _",
    "resolution and the distance to the galaxy and following kennicutt ( 1989 ) , we then calculate an average star formation rate density for the ring of @xmath37m@xmath11yr@xmath17kpc@xmath38 , with no corrections for reddening or dust extinction .",
    "foreground extinction is estimated to be small here , only @xmath39mag at @xmath40-band ( schlegel et al .",
    "even if the extinction is 2 - 3 times larger than this estimate in the uv , the revised log star formation rate ( m@xmath11yr@xmath17 ) is only @xmath41 , for a star formation rate density of @xmath42m@xmath11yr@xmath17kpc@xmath38 .",

    "2009 ; thilker et al .",
    "2010 ) and may be due to the fact that the uv emission is discontinuous across the large area of the ring ( i.e. , between @xmath21 and @xmath23 ) .      summing the sky - subtracted fluxes in the inner galaxy and in the ring area in each band and taking their ratio yields a simple measurement of the change in brightness of the central portion of the galaxy relative to the brightness of the ring .",
    "figure 4 shows these ratios from 24 to 500@xmath0 , where the errors are calculated from photometric uncertainties .",
    "we see that the ratio of the flux in the ring aperture to the flux in the central circle increases with increasing wavelength , indicating that there is a corresponding decrease in temperature of the dust in the ring compared to the inner galaxy .",
    "similarly , figure 5 shows the sed of the whole galaxy at far - infrared wavelengths , along with the sed points for the inner portion of the galaxy only ( within @xmath21 ) and for the ring only ( between @xmath21 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "the sed for the ring shows that this area generates cooler emission than the central region of the galaxy .",
    "the central portion of the galaxy contributes more to the total galactic emission from warm dust at 24@xmath0 ( @xmath43 ) but is quickly overtaken by the cool ring starting at 160@xmath0 , as already suggested by the results of figure 4 . to calculate the temperatures of the emitting dust in various portions of the galaxy , we fit a blackbody with a frequency - dependent emissivity with an exponent of 1.5 to both the ring and inner galaxy seds from 70 to 500@xmath0 , following engelbracht et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and skibba et al .",
    "trends are unaffected if emissivity values of 1 or 2 are used , although the temperatures systematically increase or decrease , respectively .",
    "the uncertainties in the temperatures are computed via a monte carlo simulation in which 10,000 trials are performed .",
    "the photometric measurements are allowed to vary in a normal distribution with a standard deviation indicated by the photometric uncertainty .",
    "the cool dust temperature of the ring is @xmath44k and for the inner portion of the galaxy it is @xmath45k .",
    "this gives @xmath46 .",
    "both of these dust temperature values are typical of cool dust temperatures in nearby galaxies ( e.g. , hinz et al .  2006 ; 2008b ) .",
    "the values for ngc1291 are slightly different from those found by engelbracht et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , likely due to the difference in apertures used , but consistent with their overall finding that earlier type spirals have higher central temperatures by 20% to 50% over their late - type counterparts .",
    "the temperature ratio is closer to that found for strongly barred galaxies compared to those derived in weakly barred galaxies , though the bar classification for this galaxy changes slightly between optical and near - infrared analyses , from sb to sab ( buta et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the dust masses for ngc1291 , as a whole and for its components , can be calculated using the mid - infrared photometry from irac , pacs , mips and spire and the models of draine & li ( 2001 ; 2007 ) and constructed as suggested in draine et al .",

    "( 2012 ) for two other spiral galaxies from kingfish .",
    "the results of such fitting for ngc1291 are summarized here , with the black solid line in figure 5 representing the final fit to the data for the whole galaxy .",
    "the apertures , dust masses ( @xmath47 ) , aperture areas , mean starlight heating intensities ( @xmath48 ) , fluxes radiated by dust corresponding to photodissociation regions ( @xmath49 ) and the fractions of grain mass contributed by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( @xmath50 ) are listed in table 1 . the total dust mass for the galaxy , calculated from a sum of the modeling for each individual galaxy pixel , is @xmath51m@xmath11 , with a total dust luminosity of @xmath52 l@xmath11 .",

    "this @xmath48 can be related to the characteristic dust temperature , @xmath55 , by the approximate relation @xmath56 , where @xmath48 is in units of the starlight energy density in the solar neighborhood ( aniano et al .",
    "several explanations for the existence of an outer ring with cooler dust may be plausible .",
    "it is possible that all spiral galaxies have a dust temperature gradient between their inner and outer disks .",
    "this might be due to the concentration of old stars or star formation occurring at the center of the galaxy in comparison to the more sparse stellar population of the comparatively large outer disk , i.e. , that the density of the radiation field in the center of a galaxy is higher than that in the outer parts .",
    "another explanation could be that the nucleus of the galaxy contains an agn which heats the dust to higher temperatures in the inner region in comparison to the outskirts .",
    "perhaps the inner bar of the galaxy fuels star formation in that area by funneling gas continuously , such that rapid star formation heats the inner dust to warm temperatures . or",
    "it could be that the stellar population of the outer ring is older than that of the inner features . in this case , the older stars maintain the dust at cooler temperatures than areas with active star formation .",
    "we now discuss each of these possible explanations in turn .",
    "first , we explore the idea that all galaxies have similar dust temperature gradients to ngc1291 .",
    "engelbracht et al .",
    "( 2010 ) showed that the central areas of early - type spiral galaxies generally have enhanced dust heating of their cool dust components compared to their disks .",
    "they find that , on average , the cool dust temperature of the central component is @xmath57 hotter than the disk .",
    "similarly , pohlen et al .  ( 2010 ) showed that spire surface brightness ratios seem to decrease with radius in spirals , implying that the dust in the outer regions is colder than dust in the centers of galaxies .",

    "spitzer _ and _ herschel _ data seds with two modified blackbodies and creating spatially - resolved maps of their dust properties .",
    "they also see systematic drops in dust temperature with radius for disk galaxies , also on the order of 10 - 15k from inner to outer galaxy .    however , it is not obvious that ngc1291 should follow this pattern and that outer rings should be dominated by cool dust emission .",
    "uv rings in s0 and early - type spiral galaxies are often associated with sites of recent star formation , sometimes marked by clumpy hii regions , and can even be the only sites of star formation in some galaxies ( e.g. , donovan et al .",
    "2009 ; thilker et al .",
    "a recent study of five nearby barred s0 galaxies with rings by marino et al .",
    "( 2011 ) showed that these outer rings account for a majority ( up to 70% ) of the flux at uv wavelengths , indicating their young stellar population .",

    "( 2010 ) specifically discuss the morphology of ngc1291 based on @xmath24-band and 3.6@xmath0 irac images ( sheth et al .",
    "2010 ) , saying that the outer ring is `` where most of the recent star formation is taking place '' and is prominent in the @xmath24-band ( figure 1 ) . at 3.6@xmath0",
    ", however , the ring does not stand out and is instead a broad ellipse in a rounder diffuse background ( figure 1 and their figure 7 ) .",
    "therefore , we might expect that , if the 24@xmath0 emission is associated with the warm ( t@xmath58k ) dust heated by the young stellar population ( seen at uv and @xmath24-band to be prominent ) , then the warm dust at 24@xmath0 should be brighter in the ring as well , yet the wavelengths associated with cool ( t@xmath12k ) dust are brighter relative to the flux from the rest of the galaxy .    to study the dust temperature gradient in ngc1291 in more detail , figure 6 displays circles of radii @xmath59 , @xmath21 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath54 overlaid on the spire 250@xmath0 image , along with the estimated temperature of the dust within each annular aperture , using the same blackbody fitting technique as before .",
    "( these annuli match the dust mass annuli calculations found in table 1 .",
    "unlike table 1 , the data for figure 6 are not convolved to the 160@xmath0 resolution . )",
    "we remind the reader that such temperatures are representative , characterizing large grains that dominate the emission at wavelengths greater than 70@xmath0 , and that , in fact , such large annuli contain a wide range of temperatures , including small grains undergoing temperature fluctuations . keeping this in mind , if all disks , with or without rings , have similar dust temperature gradients due to the gradually increasing distance between star formation regions with radius , then we should be able to identify the same drop in temperature for spirals other than ngc1291 .",
    "we choose , from the kingfish sample , ngc628 ( sac ; @xmath62mpc ) , which does not contain any rings but is face - on , is at a similar distance to ngc1291 and has a similar angular size and total infrared luminosity to ngc1291 .",
    "we show in figure 6 the dust temperatures for this galaxy for the same annular apertures as ngc1291 . for this galaxy ,",
    "we see a gradual decline in temperature with some scatter .",
    "we see neither the dramatic dip in temperature at @xmath21 that is seen for ngc1291 , nor do we see such a large spread in temperatures , with ngc628 having a temperature difference between inner and outer areas of 4.8k versus 8.2k for ngc1291 .",
    "thus , it appears that the dust temperature from the ring is cooler than would be expected from a simple temperature decline with radius for a normal ( non - ringed ) spiral galaxy .",
    "comparisons of spatially resolved dust temperatures with a larger number of kingfish galaxies are shown in galametz et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "the next possibility is that non - stellar sources such as an agn could heat the dust in the inner portion of the galaxy , where we find a warmer dust temperature compared to the outer ring .",

    "( 2010 ) classify ngc1291 as an `` agn '' type galaxy based on optical spectra of the nuclear region , although they note that one or more emission line(s ) failed their s / n@xmath64 requirement for such a classification .",
    "recent analysis of x - ray spectra of the nuclear source also indicates a low - luminosity agn with moderate obscuration ( luo et al .",
    "2012 ) which could be a source of dust heating .",
    "the third possibility is that the bar in ngc1291 , seen at the various wavelengths in figure 1 , funnels gas into the inner region of the galaxy , replenishing the supply necessary for star formation .",
    "this compact region of star formation could then generate warmer dust temperatures than in the outer ring ( see also engelbracht et al .",
    "if gas is being transported inwards in this manner , the observational evidence would likely be in the form of `` hotspots '' at the ends of the bar - features that are brighter than the rest of the bar formed by shock heating of the gas as it is drawn to the center of the galaxy , causing a `` pile - up '' near the inner lindblad resonance ( combes & gerin 1985 ; shlosman et al .",
    "this is not seen in the hi data , which has a hole at the center ( van driel et al .",
    "1988 ) , or in the other wavelengths that are available .",
    "however , we can not rule out this possibility , as such hotspots are thought to be small , very faint features .",
    "hunt & malkan ( 1999 ) argue that rings alone could be signs of inward transport of material , essentially a second `` pile - up '' of dust and gas in the outer resonance of the galaxy ; the star formation in the ring prominent in the uv , presumably indicating stellar ages of @xmath65myr , could be a residual signature of such a build - up .",
    "we note that transport of material via the bar may be related to the agn hypothesis in the previous section , in that agns as well as star formation can be fueled via inflow .",
    "the last explanation for the change in cool dust temperature between the inner galaxy and outer ring is that the ring is composed mainly of an old population of stars with some current star formation . in this case , the dust in the ring was produced by generations of stars in the past and is heated now mainly by the old ( @xmath66gyr ) stellar population , shown best by the 3.6@xmath0 image ( buta et al .",
    "2010 and figure 1 ) where the ring is a large , diffuse entity spanning much more physical space than seen at far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "such `` old population rings '' have been suggested by comparisons between @xmath24 and @xmath67-band images of nearby galaxies .",
    "buta ( 1995 ) showed a typical galaxy of this type ( ic1438 ) which has a nuclear ring , an oval inner ring , and an outer ring that is much brighter in the @xmath67 passband than in the @xmath24 .",
    "the explanation given for this difference in brightness was that the outer ring component formed first and left behind a stellar remnant as the other two inner features formed .",
    "an old outer ring would be unusual in that the dynamical timescales for forming rings or arms are much shorter at smaller disk radii ( e.g. , freeman et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "a remnant of this type could be the source of dust heating for the emission we see at far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "in addition , there would also be a contribution to the dust heating from ionizing ultraviolet photons which have escaped from the existing ( but weaker , in terms of contribution ) star forming regions .",
    "this combination of dust heating sources has been well modeled by , e.g. , misiriotis et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and popescu et al .",
    "( 2002 ; 2011 ) , and proposed to explain observations of other nearby galaxies ( hinz et al .",
    "2004 , tabatabaei et al .",
    "2007 , bendo et al .  2010 ) .",
    "( though see groves et al .",
    "2012 for a case where the old stellar population heats dust to warm temperatures . ) inspection of the @xmath24-@xmath67 image ( r.  buta , private communication ) shows such a color difference and will be investigated further in buta et al .",
    "simulations by freeman et al .",
    "( 2010 ) addressing hoag s object , an outer ring galaxy with no inner morphological features , show that an outer ring can be formed via perturbations from a bar which then dissipates slowly over time . in the environment of these instabilities",
    ", the majority of the simulated gas particles fall to the center , while the remaining particles create an outer ring , with the region between the two essentially empty .",
    "if this is the manner in which ngc1291 is forming its ring , then the implication is that the ring is unlikely to be older than the inner regions .",
    "noll et al .",
    "( 2009 ) use sed fitting techniques to study the star - formation history of ngc1291 and posit two exponential starburst events for the galaxy , one of which occurred 10gyr ago and the second of which occurred 200myr ago .",
    "this analysis was performed for the entire galaxy . a similar study for the inner portion and the ring separately would help disentangle their stellar histories .",
    "far - infrared images from _ herschel _ of the ringed galaxy ngc1291 show that the morphology of the galaxy changes from that found in the optical , with some features such as the lens disappearing , and other features such as the spiral - like inner region identified for the first time .",
    "additionally , the large outer ring becomes more prominent at wavelengths longer than 160@xmath0 .",
    "an exploration of temperature of the dust emission via blackbody fitting in annular apertures over the face of the galaxy yields the result that the dust in the ring is @xmath68k cooler than that found in the inner @xmath69 .",
    "further modeling shows that this cool dust in the ring dominates the total galaxy dust mass .",
    "we discuss whether , despite the presence of recent star formation traced by uv emission , the dust in the ring is heated primarily by a large , diffuse stellar population which is older than that of the inner portion of the galaxy and the bulge , lens and bar features located there .",
    "this older stellar population would allow the cool dust to remain at temperatures of @xmath12k .",
    "other possibilities for the dust temperature difference discussed here include an expected temperature gradient due to the change in starlight heating intensity , heating of the inner region by a low - luminosity agn , and increased star formation in the inner region due to gas transport along the bar .",
    "j.  l.  h.  thanks r.  buta for a preview of his @xmath24 and @xmath67 images of ngc1291 and for helpful discussions .",
