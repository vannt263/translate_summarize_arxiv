    "since the birth of nonlinear optics@xcite as a discipline in physics nonlinear optical processes have been of great interest to scientists , for instance to help describe surfaces and interfaces of condensed matter.@xcite studies of surfaces and interfaces of condensed media belong to the regime of mesoscopic physics , where also quantum wells , -wires and -dots can be found.@xcite among the many nonlinear optical phenomena that has been studied in the regime of mesoscopic physics are ( i ) second harmonic generation from magnetic@xcite as well as nonmagnetic systems , ( ii ) sum- and difference frequency generation , of which one of the most prominent applications today is sisyphus cooling of atoms , ( iii ) photon drag , ( iv ) dc - electric - field induced second harmonic generation,@xcite ( v ) the second - order kerr effect , ( vi ) electronic and vibrational surface raman scattering , ( vii ) two - photon photoemission , ( viii ) generation of higher harmonics,@xcite ( ix ) the second - order lorenz - mie scattering,@xcite and ( x ) degenerate four - wave mixing .    in the present communication we study phase conjugation by",
    "degenerate four - wave mixing in a quantum - well structure , where both interband and intraband transitions are allowed .",
    "phase conjugation is a nonlinear process where the response field is counterpropagating to an incoming probe field .",
    "the usual descriptions ( see refs .   and references therein ) of degenerate four - wave mixing ( dfwm ) are based on the assumption that the field amplitudes are slowly varying on the optical wavelength scale [ slowly varying envelope ( sve ) approximation ] , and thus also on the electric dipole ( ed ) approximation .",
    "we have previously presented the reasons ( in refs .   and ) why these approximations are invalid when considering optical interactions with matter of mesoscopic size , especially when evanescent components of the optical field are present .",
    "four - wave mixing in media with two - dimensional translational invariance has so far been studied by other authors in the context of phase conjugation of electromagnetic surface waves,@xcite and of a bulk wave by surface waves . in these investigations",
    "macroscopic electrodynamic approaches were used . in order to go beyond the sve and ed approximations a nonlocal microscopic theoretical model for optical phase conjugation by dfwm has been constructed ( see ref .  ) for nonmagnetic media .",
    "in addition to avoiding the sve and ed approximations , other usually made approximations when considering optical phase conjugation are avoided in our model , namely ( i ) the paraxial approximation , ( ii ) the assumption of a lossless medium , ( iii ) the assumption of a weak probe field , and ( iv ) the requirement of phase matching between the interacting fields .    in a two - dimensional translationally invariant",
    "system the change in energy of an electron due to an electric field can either involve a change of momentum along the translationally invariant plane ( intraband transition ) , a change of energy eigenstate perpendicular to the translationally invariant plane ( interband transition ) , or both .",
    "the change of momentum along the translationally invariant plane occurs as an addition of the momentum parallel to the plane of the interacting field component ( denoted by @xmath0 ) to ( or subtraction from ) the momentum of the electron parallel to the surface ( denoted @xmath1 ) .",
    "it is thus convenient to divide the photon momentum @xmath2 into its components parallel and perpendicular to that plane , i.e. , @xmath3 .",
    "then the vacuum dispersion relation @xmath4 provides us with an extra degree of freedom , since @xmath5 can be larger than @xmath6 . using the vacuum dispersion relation we find that @xmath7 becomes imaginary in that case . in the following ,",
    "propagating field components thus shall refer to the case where @xmath7 is a real quantity , and evanescent field components to the case where @xmath7 is a purely imaginary quantity .",
    "if we want to get a broad understanding of the phase conjugated response of a probe containing both propagating and evanescent field components from a quantum - well phase conjugator , two cases are of fundamental interest , namely ( i ) the pure intraband case and ( ii ) the case where also an interband transition is involved .",
    "the phase conjugated response from a pure intraband quantum well we have described in ref .  .",
    "this analysis revealed that the phase conjugation reflection coefficient is not only highly nonuniform in the @xmath0-spectrum , but also that the coupling efficiency is several orders of magnitude larger in part of the evanescent regime than in the propagating regime .",
    "since evanescent waves are strongly decaying in space we further concluded that if one wants to see the phase conjugation of evanescent modes , both excitation and observation should take place close to the surface of the quantum well .",
    "furthermore was discussed the problems of excitation of the near - field regime , and the consequences from choosing a broadbanded ( with respect to @xmath0 ) two - dimensional point source ( quantum wire ) revealed that parts of the evanescent spectrum could be excited , and in ref .",
    "that phase conjugation of evanescent fields can lead to a focus of the phase conjugated field substantially below the so - called diffraction limit.@xcite since this has also been experimentally observed,@xcite we judge that it is highly relevant also to give an account of how evanescent fields are phase conjugated in a system where not only one electronic level is present .    since including more than one interband transition",
    "will be necessary for most practical applications , we present in this paper the complete solution to the theoretical model of ref .   in the case of two - dimensional translational invariance , although a description based on the self - field approximation according to the feibelman theory@xcite would be sufficient in order to determine the dominating response . giving a complete solution also allows us to comment on what we would lose using the self - field approximation .",
    "the solution is based on a discretization in the energy levels of the two - dimensionally tranlational invariant medium .",
    "contrary to discretization schemes performed in real space or fourier space , our discretization does not in itself imply an approximation .",
    "thus , once the complete orthonormal set of wavefunctions for the phase conjugating medium has been determined , the phase conjugated response can in principle be calculated from the solution presented in this paper . how to find the proper set of wavefunctions for a given material system is another problem , which for example can be treated using one of several band - structure methods,@xcite e.g. , the korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr),@xcite the linearized augmented plane - wave ( lapw),@xcite or the linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) method.@xcite these methods are based on an atomic description of the potential in a certain radius of each atom , adding exchange- and correlation terms@xcite and different approximations in the regions between the atomic boundaries .",
    "using such a method one will probably be able to give more accurate numerical results for specific materials , but at the cost of the ( relatively ) analytical simplicity .",
    "therefore , we will not elaborate further on this point here , but in stead resort to using a simple description of the matter wavefunctions . doing so",
    ", we will be able to present a qualitative discussion based on analytical expressions .",
    "using a two - level quantum - well phase conjugator , it is also possible to study resonant four - wave mixing , which until now has been studied only without spatial dispersion ( at the point @xmath8 in the @xmath9-@xmath10-plane , @xmath11 being the interband transition frequency ) , as described in , e.g. , refs .  .",
    "thus , in sec .  [ sec : ii ] we present the theory in the form of a local - field formalism , we choose a scattering geometry , and the solution is presented as a discretization in the energy eigenstates . in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] we prepare for a numerical calculation .",
    "we start by adopting the simple infinite barrier ( ib ) model to describe the quantum well .",
    "furthermore we define the phase conjugation reflection coefficient , and the section is concluded with a specific choice of a convenient system to investigate .",
    "to give an impression of the implications of our theoretical model we have presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : iv ] numerical calculations for a two - level quantum - well phase conjugator .",
    "the calculation is supplemented by a discussion of the results , in particular an identification of the different resonances appearing when the wavenumber along the surface plane as well as the frequency varies . in sec .",
    "[ sec : v ] we widen our discussions , with emphasis on ( i ) the interband resonance , ( ii ) the validity of the self - field approximation , and ( iii ) the choice of appropriate relaxation times . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : vi ] , we conclude .",
    "as a forerunner for the analysis of the optical phase conjugation from a two - level quantum well we briefly sketch how a local - field calculation allows one to determine the so - called degenerate four - wave mixing response of a mesoscopic metallic film deposited on a dielectric substrate . to create a phase conjugated field , which in the plane of the film propagates in a direction opposite to that of the probe field , two counterpropagating pump fields must be present inside the phase conjugating medium .",
    "although the theoretical model developed in ref .   allows us to make almost arbitrary choices of the interacting optical fields , we will in the present work assume for simplicity that the pump fields ( i ) propagate parallel to the plane of the film , and ( ii ) have constant amplitude across the film .",
    "the scattering geometry is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] together with the chosen coordinate system .",
    "we will further limit our study to the case where ( iii ) scattering takes place in the @xmath12-@xmath13-plane , and ( iv ) the interacting fields are linearly polarized , either in ( p - polarized ) or perpendicular to ( s - polarized ) the scattering plane . since it is necessary in a study of nonlinear optical phenomena in mesoscopic interaction volumes to abandon macroscopic electrodynamics , the starting point is the microscopic maxwell - lorentz equations . the phase conjugated field from a quantum well exhibiting free - electron - like dynamics in the plane of the well ( @xmath12-@xmath14-plane ) can then be described using the single - coordinate ( @xmath13 ) loop equation@xcite    ( 0,0)(85,25 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 2,15)(83,15 ) ( 2,0)(83,10 ) ( 0,7)(30,7 ) ( 0.35,7)(29,7 ) ( 24,7)(0,0)[c]2 ( 85,7)(55,7 ) ( 84.65,7)(56,7 ) ( 61,7)(0,0)[c]1 ( 15,24 ) ( 0,0)(20,0 ) ( 0.25,0)(19.25,0 ) ( 0,-1)(0,0)[tl]probe ( 69.25,0.25)(82.75,3.25 ) ( 82.25,0.25)(-12.5,3)[c]substrate ( 82.75,14.5)(0,0)[tr]quantum well ( 82.75,16)(0,0)[br]vacuum ( 36,0 ) ( 3,10)1.75 ( -0.5,9.875)(15.5,9.875 ) ( 3,25)(3,-1 ) ( 1.5,15)(4.5,15 ) ( 12,8.375)(15.5,9.375)(12,9.375 ) ( -0.5,0.25)(3.625,0.25)(4.625,3)(-0.5,3 ) ( 0,9.875)(15,9.875 ) ( 3,25)(3,0 ) ( 3,10)1.0 ( 3,10)0.25 ( 15,11)(0,0)[rb]@xmath12 ( 2,11)(0,0)[rb]@xmath14 ( 1.75,0.75)(0,0)[rb]@xmath13 ( 2,15)(4,15 ) ( 3.5,15.5)(0,0)[bl]@xmath15    @xmath16    where @xmath10 is the common angular frequency of the participating fields , and @xmath0 is the component of the probe field in the film plane .",
