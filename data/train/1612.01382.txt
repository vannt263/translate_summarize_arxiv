    "in most of the textbooks the circle of apollonius is discussed in conjunction with the angle bisector theorem : _  the angle bisector in a triangle divides the opposite sides into a ratio equal to the ratio of the adjacent sides . \"",
    "_ once one realizes that the statement can be equally applied to the exterior angle bisector , then the circle of apollonius appears naturally ( figure  [ locus1 ] ) , since the two angle bisectors are perpendicular .     ]    for instance , an easy exercise in algebra shows that the circle of equation @xmath0 is equivalent to @xmath1    taking @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "similar calculations can be employed to treat the general situation , i.e. , taking @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 with real positive numbers @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 such that @xmath12 .",
    "then we can state the well - known result :    [ apollonius ] given points @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 as above , the set of points @xmath16 in the plane characterized by the equality @xmath17 is    \\(i ) the line of equation @xmath18 if @xmath19 ;    \\(ii ) the circle of equation @xmath20 , if @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "let us observe that the statement of this theorem does not reduce the generality since the coordinate of point @xmath23 can be shown to be @xmath24 and one can take the origin of coordinates to be the midpoint of @xmath25 .",
    "this turns out to happen precisely when @xmath22 .    what is the equivalent of this result in hyperbolic geometry",
    "we are going to use the half - plane model , @xmath26 , to formulate our answer to this question ( see anderson @xcite for the terminology and notation used ) . without loss of generality we may assume as before that the three points are on the @xmath27-axis : @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , with real positive numbers @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 such that @xmath12 .    [ theorem1 ] given points @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 as above , the set of points @xmath16 in the half - plane @xmath26 , characterized by the equality @xmath17 in @xmath26 is the curve given in polar coordinates by    @xmath28    moreover ,    \\(i ) if @xmath29 , this curve is half of the hyperbola of equation @xmath30    \\(ii ) if @xmath31 this curve is the semi - circle @xmath32 , @xmath33 ,    \\(iii ) if @xmath34 , this curve is half of the lemniscate of equation @xmath35    it is interesting that all these particular cases in theorem  [ theorem1 ] , can be accomplished using integer values of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this is not surprising for the diophantine equation @xmath22 since one can play with the prime decomposition of @xmath9 and @xmath11 to get @xmath36 a perfect square . for the equation",
    "@xmath37 one can take a pythagorean triple and set @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "perhaps it is quite intriguing for some readers that the last diophantine equation @xmath42 is satisfied by the product of some quadratic forms , namely @xmath43 another surprising fact is that theorem  [ theorem1 ] appears as a more general result than theorem  [ apollonius ] because of part ( ii ) and the observation that we can always assume that the axes of coordinates are chosen with the origin to be the center of the apollonius circle .",

    "we notice a certain symmetry of these cases showing that the hyperbola ( @xmath29 ) is nothing else but a lemniscate in hyperbolic geometry . with this identification",
    ", it seems like the curves we get , resemble all possible shapes of the intersection of a plane with a torus .    in the next section",
    "we will prove the above theorem and in the last section we will give the motivation of our work .",
    "let us consider a point @xmath52 of coordinates @xmath53 with the given property as in figure  [ locus3 ] which is not on the line @xmath54 , ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "then the hyperbolic lines determined by @xmath52 and the three points @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are circles orthogonal on the @xmath56-axis .",
    "we denote their centers by @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .     and the lines determined by it with @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ]    the point @xmath61 can be obtained as the intersection of the perpendicular bisector of @xmath62 and the @xmath56-axis .",
    "similarly we obtain the other two points @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the equation of the perpendicular bisector of @xmath62 is @xmath65 and so @xmath66 .",
    "similar expressions are then obtained for @xmath67 and @xmath68 , i.e. , @xmath69 and @xmath70 . which shows that the order of the points @xmath61 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 is reversed ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the angle between the hyperbolic lines @xmath72 and @xmath72 is defined by the angle between the tangent lines to the two circles at @xmath52 , which is clearly equal to the angle between the radii corresponding to @xmath52 in each of the two circles .",
    "so , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "this equality is characterized by the proportionality given by the angle bisector theorem in the triangle @xmath75 : @xmath76 using polar coordinates , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , we observe that @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "hence the above equality is equivalent to @xmath81 one can check that a factor of @xmath82 can be simplified out and in the end we obtain ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "our interest in this locus was motivated by the problem 11915 in this monthly ( ) . this problem stated : _ given four ( distinct ) points @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath23 in ( this ) order on a line in euclidean space , under what conditions will there be a point @xmath52 off the line such that the angles @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 have equal measure ? _    it is not difficult to show , using two apollonius circles , that the existence of such a point @xmath52 is characterized by the inequality involving the cross - ratio    @xmath86=\\frac{\\frac{bc}{ba}}{\\frac{dc}{da}}<3.\\ ] ]    we were interested in finding a similar description for the same question in hyperbolic space .",
    "one can think using the same idea of the locus that replaces the apollonius circle in euclidean geometry and that is why we looked into finding what this locus is .",
    "having the description of this locus one can see that the intersection of two curves as in theorem  [ theorem1 ] is difficult to predict .",
    "fortunately , we can use the calculation done in the proof of theorem  [ theorem1 ] and formulate a possible answer in the new setting . given four points @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath23 in ( this ) order on a line in the hyperbolic space",
    ", we can use an isometry to transform them on the line @xmath87 and having coordinates @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "the the existence of a point @xmath52 off the line @xmath87 , such that the angles @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 have equal measure in the hyperbolic space is equivalent to the existence of @xmath52 in euclidean space corresponding to the points @xmath61 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath90 as constructed in the proof of theorem  [ theorem1 ] .",
    "therefore the answer is in terms of a similar inequality    @xmath91=\\frac{\\frac{b'c'}{b'a'}}{\\frac{d'c'}{d'a'}}<3 \\leftrightarrow \\frac{(b^2-c^2)(a^2-d^2)}{(a^2-b^2)(c^2-d^2)}<3.\\ ] ]    to have a different take of what ( [ eq2 ] ) means we will translate it into a geometric probability which is not difficult to compute : _ if two points are randomly selected ( uniform distribution ) on the segment @xmath92 , then the probability that a point @xmath52 off the line @xmath92 such that the angles @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 have equal measure exists ( where the two points are denoted by @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath14 being the closest to @xmath13 ) , is equal to @xmath93 _    the inequality ( [ eq3 ] ) gives us the similar probability in the hyperbolic space :    @xmath94    where the uniform distribution here means , it is calculated with respect to the measure @xmath95 along the @xmath27-axis .",
    "our both problems must have an even more interesting answer in the setting of spherical geometry . due to the infinite nature of both euclidean and hyperbolic spaces the geometric probability question",
    "makes sense only in limiting situations . in this case we can simply ask :      * problem 2 : * _ given a line in spherical geometry and four points on it , chosen at random with uniform distribution , what is the probability that the points look equidistant from a point on the sphere that is not on that line ? _    we find the problems more fascinating because there is no clear order in this geometry . given three collinear points ,",
    "any of them can be thought as between the other two .",
    "so , we may expect three different curves as a result .",
    "if three points @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are already equidistant on a line @xmath96 , the three lines perpendicular to @xmath96 through these points satisfy the locus requirement and they are concurrent .",
    "is there such a point ( in fact at least two if one exists ) of concurrency , for a general position of three points on a line ?",
    "perhaps not , if the three points are close to one another ; but there must be quite a variety of situations when it is possible . also , the probability in question , we anticipate to be somewhat bigger ."
