    "multiple ionization of atoms takes place at intermediate and high intensities when they are subjected to laser pulses  @xcite .",
    "the routes by which these multiple ionizations occur can be quite complicated .",
    "two main routes have been identified for the double ionization of two - active - electron systems ( like the helium atom subjected to linearly polarized laser pulses ) : a sequential process and a nonsequential one  @xcite . in the sequential process",
    "the field ionizes one electron after the other in an uncorrelated way .",
    "in contrast , the electron - electron correlation plays an active role in the ionization of the second electron in the nonsequential process .",
    "more specifically , the field picks up an electron , and sends this electron to the remaining ion core to dislodge the second electron , according the so - called recollision ( or 3-step ) scenario  @xcite .",
    "it has been observed experimentally in a broad range of intensities that non - sequential double ionization ( nsdi ) [ also referred to as correlated double ionization ( cdi )  @xcite ] yields can be many orders of magnitude larger than in the sequential double ionization ( sdi ) [ also referred to as uncorrelated double ionization ( udi ) ] counterpart .",
    "varying the intensity gives rise to a characteristic `` knee '' shape for the double ionization yield as a function of the laser intensity .",
    "this strong effect due to electron - electron correlation has been observed experimentally  @xcite and also theoretically using quantum  @xcite , semi - classical  @xcite and classical simulations  @xcite .    in this article , we investigate the dynamics resulting from the interaction between helium atoms and a bichromatic linearly polarized laser field using a classical model .",
    "classical means are entirely sufficient to produce the strong electron correlation needed to explain double ionization phenomena  @xcite . atomic phenomena in intense bichromatic fields can be considered as an extension of the principles of coherent control into the nonlinear nonperturbative regime of laser - atom interactions  @xcite .",
    "although the classical mechanisms of double ionization remain qualitatively the same as for a monochromatic laser field  @xcite , the double ionization yields show a strong sensitivity to changes in the parameters of the laser field , namely the phase lag between the two colors and their relative amplitudes .",
    "we explain this dependence using an analysis in terms of phase space structures .",
    "our main result is that all these processes are regulated primarily by the dynamics of the inner electron which is the electron that remains bounded after the other one has been ionized .",
    "remarkably , this electron , rather than being a spectator , is in fact the driver in the ionization process .",
    "we consider a classical model with one spatial dimension for each electron which corresponds to the direction of polarization of the laser field .",
    "we denote the positions of the two electrons by @xmath0 and @xmath1 and set the origin at the nucleus .",

    "we consider soft coulomb potentials  @xcite defined by two softening parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the interaction between charged particles .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system in the dipole approximation is obtained by the sum of the kinetic energy of the electrons , the soft coulomb potentials between the two electrons and between the electrons and the nucleus , and the interaction of the electrons with the field : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a bichromatic laser field , defined as : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the amplitude of the dominant mode , @xmath10 its frequency , @xmath11 the ratio of the amplitudes of the two colors of the laser field , @xmath12 characterizes the mode locking between the two components , and @xmath13 is the phase lag .",

    "sec : nldynanalysis ] an analysis of the phase space structures .",
    "starting from the classical model  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , we perform a statistical analysis of a large ensemble of trajectories ( typically 150,000 ) initially on the ground state ( with a microcanonical distribution  @xcite ) . at the end of the pulse , a trajectory can exhibit zero , one or two ionized electrons . in our calculations , an electron is considered ionized when its energy ( defined as the sum of its kinetic energy and the coulomb interaction with the nucleus ) is positive , which corresponds to an electron free from the coulomb potential well . a convenient observable",
    "is the probability of double ionization where the two electrons have a positive energy at the end of the pulse .",
    "this probability is commonly plotted as a function of the laser intensity .",
    "a signature of nsdi is a characteristic knee shape : in the intermediate intensity range , these yields are much higher ( by several orders of magnitude ) than expected from the uncorrelated sequential double ionization mechanism  @xcite . at high intensity ,",
    "the yields reach saturation , corresponding to double ionization of all the electrons of the ensemble . in",

    "more precisely , in the intermediate intensity range the level of double ionization yields greatly vary with @xmath13 by a factor of 3 ; however , when varying @xmath13 the range of intensity where the knee is located ( around @xmath24 , vertical dashed - dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : knee_delta ] ) does not change significantly . in the low intensity regime i.e. , for intensities lower than @xmath25",
    "there is a very weak dependence of @xmath13 in these yields .",
    "the same conclusions hold for other values of @xmath14 .",
    "we note a significant impact of the phase lag in the resulting double ionization probability , meaning that adjusting this parameter can act as a control knob for both sequential and non - sequential processes .",
    "one advantage of varying the phase lag between the two components of the laser field is that no additional input of energy is required ( as opposed to varying other parameters like @xmath14 ) since the mean value of the electromagnetic energy does not depend on @xmath13 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : max_p_di_delta ] we represent the double ionization yield as a function of @xmath13 for the intensity labeled by the vertical magenta continuous line in fig .",

    "more specifically , we observe a fast variation of the double ionization yield with changes of the phase lag around @xmath27 and a flattening around @xmath26 .",
    "this confirms the high sensitivity of the double ionization probability to the parameter @xmath13 .    except for very low intensity ( i.e. below @xmath28 )",
    "we observe qualitatively the same impact of @xmath13 on the double ionization yield ( a bell shape almost centered around @xmath26 ) . the precise value of the phase lag for which the probability is maximum depends on the laser parameters .",

    "we define @xmath29 the intensity , as a function of the phase lag , for which saturation of double ionization is reached .",

    ", we notice no significant dependence on the parameters at low intensities ( below @xmath33 ) . in the intermediate intensity range",
    ", we notice that the probability greatly varies with @xmath14 ( more than a factor two ) whereas the intensity at which the characteristic knee is developed does not change significantly . in the meantime",
    ", the udi component also increases with @xmath14 , and we notice a decrease of the intensity @xmath34 where double ionization is saturated . as a consequence we notice a flattening in the knee , the two cdi and udi curves merging .    as @xmath14",
    "is increased , the second color of the laser field becomes more important , hence @xmath13 is expected to have a more prominent role in controlling the system because the variation in probability becomes larger .",

    ", the statistical analysis shows these three main trends when changing the parameters of the field :    1 .   high sensitivity of the actual probability of double ionization , [ obs:3 ] 2 .   high sensitivity of the intensity of saturation of the double ionization yields , [ obs:1 ] 3 .",
    "low sensitivity of the intensity of knee regime ( i.e. the cdi maximum ) .",
    "[ obs:2 ]    in the next section , we analyze the dynamics of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) in terms of phase space structures and we find results that support and explain these trends .",
    "for the dynamical analysis of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) we follow the one performed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the monochromatic laser pulse .",
    "the analysis proceeds in the following way : first , without laser field ( @xmath37 ) , an outer electron and an inner one were identified from a periodic orbit analysis of the chaotic motion of typical trajectories .",
    "when the field is turned on , if the inner electron remains bounded , the atom may undergo a recollision which follows from the 3-step picture  @xcite ( the field picks up the outer electron , and upon reversal of the field , brings it back to the core and the two electrons share the collision energy ) .",
    "the dynamics of both electrons are accurately reproduced by reduced models except during recollisions  @xcite .",
    "these models allow one to derive the main properties of the double ionization curves versus intensity .",
    "we begin by investigating the behavior of typical trajectories . in fig .  [",
    "fig : cdi_trajectory ] , we represent the position of each electron ( upper panel ) and their energy ( kinetic energy plus soft coulomb potential , lower panel ) as functions of time for a typical trajectory .",
    "we observe that one electron is first quickly ionized ( the `` outer '' electron ) while the other remains close to the core ( the `` inner '' electron ) .",
    "once ionized , the outer electron is driven mainly by the laser field and experiences large excursions from the core .",
    "in contrast , the inner electron experiences a competition between coulomb interaction with the nucleus and the laser excitation . without loss of generality , we assign @xmath0 to the outer electron and @xmath1 to the inner one . in the sample trajectory of fig .",
    "[ fig : cdi_trajectory ] the inner electron ( red curves ) does not ionize until it collides with the outer electron ( blue curves ) .",
    "double ionization occurs at approximately 2.5 laser cycles , which can be confirmed by examining the energies of both electrons in the lower panel .",
    "we see that both electrons have positive energy after this time ( and thus are ionized ) . from this qualitative analysis",
    ", two reduced effective hamiltonians are identified , @xmath38 for the outer and @xmath39 for the inner one :    @xmath40    where we have neglected the interaction with other charges for the outer electron and have allowed the inner electrons to feel both the laser field and the attraction from the nucleus . for both electrons , we ignore the electron - electron interaction term since they are assumed to be far away from each other between two recollisions .",
    "the main advantage of the above effective models is that their dimensions are lower than the one of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) ( they both have one and a half degrees of freedom ) .",
    "hamiltonian @xmath38 is even integrable in the sense that one can explicitly give the expression of the trajectories as functions of the initial conditions .",
    "hamiltonian @xmath39 is not integrable but its dynamics can be analyzed qualitatively . in what follows ,",
    "we analyze these two models as the parameters of the field are varied and correlate their dynamics with the double ionization curves plotted in sec .",
    "[ sec : stat ] in order to support and explain the observed trends .      the trajectory of the outer electron [ as governed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_out ] ) ] is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are , respectively , the position and momentum of the outer electron at time @xmath44 .",
    "an important quantity is the maximum return kinetic energy of the outer electron : it gives the maximum amount of energy the outer electron can bring to the inner electron to trigger cdi .",
    "in addition , if the outer electron recombines , it gives the cutoff in harmonic generation for photon emission  @xcite . in order to compute this quantity",
    "we need to consider a shift of the field since the electron leaves the core at a certain phase @xmath45 of the field .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is transformed into @xmath46 maximizing the kinetic energy @xmath47 with respect to the recollision time @xmath48 and the initial phase @xmath45 leads to the familiar condition that the maximum return energy is associated with trajectories leaving the nucleus with zero momentum  @xcite . as a function of the parameters of the laser field , this maximum kinetic energy is equal to @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the ponderomotive energy and @xmath51 is only a function of @xmath14 and @xmath13 . for @xmath52 , we have @xmath53  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : max_return_outer_elec ] , we represent @xmath54 as a function of @xmath13 for various values of @xmath14 .",
    "we notice that the amplitude of the variations of @xmath51 with @xmath13 increases with @xmath14 .",
    "for a fixed value of @xmath14 , the maximum return energy @xmath51 ( in units of @xmath55 ) of the outer electron can vary significantly with @xmath13 ( up to more than 2 ) .",
    "for all values of @xmath14 , the maximum of @xmath51 occurs at @xmath56 , while its minimum is obtained for @xmath57 .",
    "we notice that none of these values are related to the critical values of the phase lag for which we observe maximum of double ionization ( around @xmath26 ) and saturation of double ionization .",
    "thus , the origin of the amount of double ionization does not solely rely on the dynamics of the outer electron .",
    "it has to be complemented by the dynamics of the inner electron .      after the ionization of the outer electron , the inner electron experiences the combined action of the field and of the attraction from the nucleus only .",
    "its hamiltonian is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_in ] ) .",
    "the competition between these two interactions leads to two distinct behaviors related to two distinct regions . figure  [ fig : laminar ] represents these two regions in phase space :",

    "note that the color map is in logarithmic scale .",
    "the red and green curves are two different poincar sections of an inner electron trajectory , taken stroboscopically with the laser period .",
    "they indicate that the dark region is filled with invariant tori where electrons are bound to the nucleus ( for all time ) .",
    "the light region corresponds to ionizing electrons ( after a transient time which depends on the initial conditions , see the darker structures which spiral out ) .",
    "the rationale behind this dynamics is as follows : if the electron is close to the nucleus , then the coulomb interaction dominates over the field and the electron is bound .",
    "if it is sufficiently far , the field dominates and the dynamics of the electron is unbounded , in a similar way as the outer electron . the maximum distance",
    "the inner electron can be from the nucleus while remaining bound is a function of the laser parameters .",
    "varying certain laser parameters leads to strong variations in the size of the bound region , which is pivotal in explaining the probability of double ionization .",
    "hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h_in ] ) is not integrable .",
    "however , a close inspection of the dynamics of the inner electron in the bound region reveals that it is fairly insensitive to the field so we consider another effective hamiltonian in the bound region , namely @xmath59 which is integrable , its phase space being foliated by periodic orbits .",
    "there exists , at least locally , a canonical transformation which maps hamiltonian  ( [ eq : freefieldinnerelectron ] ) into action and angle variables .",
    "the action is defined by @xmath60 when the field is present , most of the outer invariant tori are broken , whereas most of the inner ones close to the nucleus persist .",
    "we denote by @xmath61 the action of the last invariant rotational torus which roughly corresponds to the boundary of the inner region .",
    "figure  [ fig : action_delta ] illustrates the dependence of @xmath62 with @xmath13 as @xmath14 and @xmath63 are kept fixed for an intensity in the udi regime ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "numerically , we determine @xmath65 by computing the volume of phase space for which the inner electron never ionizes during 2 laser cycle ramp up and 4 laser cycle plateau ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : action_delta ] ) .",
    "at least qualitatively , the same trend is observed in the whole udi regime ( as well as the cdi regime ) , namely an inverted bell shape with fast variations of @xmath65 around @xmath27 with a flattening and minimum centered around @xmath26 .",
    "an approximation to the size @xmath66 of the inner region can be obtained by finding the local maximum of the effective potential ( soft coulomb potential plus laser excitation ) at peak field amplitude .",
    "it is implicitly given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is given by : @xmath69}\\left| \\sin \\tau+\\alpha \\sin\\left(k\\tau+\\delta\\right)\\right|,\\ ] ] and corresponds to the peak field amplitude of the laser . in fig .",

    ", we are expecting higher double ionization probability when @xmath65 is minimum ( i.e. around @xmath26 ) and a strong sensitivity of the double ionization yield where @xmath65 varies fast ( i.e. around @xmath79 ) .",

    "[ sec : stat ] , namely that the intensity of saturated double ionization greatly varies with the choice of the laser parameters .",
    "when one electron is bound to the nucleus after the other one has ionized , the only way through which it leaves the nucleus is by an exchange of energy with the outer electron when this one comes back to the core upon sign reversal of the laser field . through this recollision the inner electron jumps from one invariant torus to another one ( depending on the amount of energy exchanged ) , and it can even jump from one invariant torus to the unbound region . after it enters into the unbound region , it ionizes ( solely due to the action of the field ) .",
