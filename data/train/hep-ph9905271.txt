    "many important signals to be studied at future high energy colliders , nlc  @xcite and lhc  @xcite , will have a large number of particles in the final state .",
    "in particular , the processes with six fermions in the final state will be of great importance for several tests of the standard model , such as the studies of top - quark and electroweak gauge bosons , as well as the search for an intermediate - mass higgs boson .",
    "such processes are already of great interest at the tevatron collider  @xcite in connection with top - quark physics",
    ". theoretical studies of six - fermion ( @xmath3 ) processes by means of complete tree - level calculations have only very recently appeared in the literature  @xcite , where top - quark physics , higgs physics and @xmath4 production have been addressed .",
    "all these studies clearly demonstrate that complete calculations are important for a precise determination of the cross - sections , and for the development of reliable event generators , whenever accurate evaluations of interference , off - shellness and background effects , as well as spin correlations , are important .    in view of the precision measurements of the top - quark properties we have to analyse , among the @xmath3 signatures , the ones containing a @xmath0 pair and two charged currents , as the top - quark decays almost exclusively into a @xmath5 boson and a @xmath6 quark .",
    "semi leptonic signatures have already been considered in refs .",
    "it is then of great interest to carefully evaluate the size of the totally hadronic , six - quark ( @xmath7 ) contributions to integrated cross - sections and distributions as well as to determine their phenomenological features .",
    "the aim of the present study is to make a first quantitative analysis in this context , for what concerns the full set of electroweak contributions to a class of @xmath8 annihilation processes related to top - quark physics .",
    "special emphasis will be given to the determination and to the analysis of the topology of the events considered , so as to characterize them , as far as possible , against the qcd backgrounds .",
    "looking at an experimental situation where the @xmath6-tagging technique can be applied , it is meaningful to distinguish the @xmath7 final states containing one @xmath0 pair , of the form @xmath9 , from those containing two or three @xmath0 pairs , respectively of the form @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the last two kinds of processes are not relevant to top - quark production , as they contain no charged currents .",

    "cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the present study the signatures with one @xmath0 pair are considered and the full set of purely electroweak contributions is taken into account .",
    "these processes can be further divided into three subsets ( although in realistic predictions they can not be treated separately ) , which are shown in table  [ tab:1bb ] : concerning the quark flavours other than @xmath6 , only charged currents are involved in the first subset , both charged and neutral currents in the second one , and only neutral currents in the third one .",
    "the total number of tree - level feynman diagrams involved in the complete electroweak calculation amounts to several hundreds .",
    "such a complexity is unavoidable , as will be shown , if an accuracy of @xmath12 is to be reached .",
    "the diagrams with top - quark production , which will be referred to as signal diagrams , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : topfd ] .",
    "they contribute to the processes in the first two columns of table  [ tab:1bb ] , but not to those in the third .",
    "all the processes receive contributions from diagrams of higgs production , of which the leading ones are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : higgsfd ] .",
    "the relevance of such contributions depends on the higgs mass and on the centre - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy : the dominant decay mode is @xmath13 for low higgs masses ( @xmath14-@xmath15 gev ) and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) for high higgs masses .",
    "the predictions can thus be expected to depend on the higgs mass .",
    "as is well known , the behaviour of the cross - section near the threshold for @xmath2 production is characterized by strong interaction effects that give a sizeable modification with respect to the purely electroweak prediction .",
    "such effects are treated in the literature  @xcite , and are not included in the calculations presented in this paper .",
    "production are also present in the literature , as recently reviewed in ref .",
    "results at energies around the threshold are shown , so as to give a thorough analysis of the electroweak contribution .",
    "some of the qcd backgrounds to the signatures considered in the present study have been evaluated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and their topology has been studied by means of event - shape variables .",
    "one of the objectives of the present work is to characterize the topology of the complete electroweak contributions in order to help finding appropriate selection criteria to reduce as far as possible the qcd backgrounds studied in ref .",
    "the analysis performed in the present work , together with the other studies in the literature so far , should give a complete picture of electroweak contributions to @xmath3 processes relevant to top - quark physics at nlc .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sect : calc ] the computing procedure is briefly described ; in section  [ sect : results ] the numerical results , including integrated cross - sections and various distributions , are presented and discussed ; section  [ sect : concl ] is devoted to our conclusions .",

    "the widths of the @xmath5 and @xmath27 bosons and of the top - quark and all the couplings are calculated at tree level .",

    "remarkable effects due to _ isr _ and _ bs _ can be seen in these plots and in particular in the thrust distribution , where the peak is strongly reduced with respect to the born approximation and the events are shifted towards the lower values of @xmath83 , which correspond to spherical events .",
    "it is interesting to observe that this phenomenon is of help for the selection of the signal with respect to qcd backgrounds . from the plots in the second row",
    ", it can be seen that the presence of the electroweak backgrounds , although visible , is almost negligible for both observables .",

    "@xcite , the thrust variable is the most effective in discriminating pure qcd backgrounds , also in the presence of electroweak backgrounds and of _ isr _ and _ bs_. at higher energies this separation appears to be more and more problematic .    on the other hand",

    "the signatures considered contain one @xmath0 pair , and receive contributions from both charged and neutral currents .",

    "the importance of the electroweak backgrounds and of the off - shellness effects has been examined . above the threshold for @xmath2 production ,",
    "the former are of the order of several per cent and the latter are at the per cent level . near the threshold ,",
    "both effects are sizeable and , in particular , a study of the dependence of the  on the higgs mass at threshold shows that variations of the order of 10@xmath1 occur for higgs masses between 100 gev and 185 gev .",
    "a complete calculation is needed to keep such effects under control and to have a @xmath12 accuracy .",
    "some distributions have been studied in a realistic approach , by using a reconstruction algorithm for the top - quark that takes into account the impossibility of identifying quark flavours other than @xmath6 .",
    "the invariant mass of the top - quark has thus been studied and the presence of electroweak background contributions as well as the initial - state radiative effects have been found not to affect the determination of the mass on the scale of experimental precision expected at nlc .    the angular distribution of the top - quark with respect to the beam axis , which is directly related , in the case of real production , to the quantum numbers of the top - quark , has been calculated and shown to be in qualitative agreement with the expectation suggested by the real production case .    finally , some event - shape variables have been studied . at a c.m .",
    "energy of 500 gev the thrust distribution turns out to be the most interesting for the aim of discriminating the leading qcd backgrounds , as suggested by other authors who discussed the top - quark signal alone .",
    "the effects of electroweak backgrounds and of _ isr _ and _ bs _ have been shown here not to alter these conclusions . at higher energies",
    ", the lorentz boost gives to the event a more collinear shape , so that the separation of qcd backgrounds could become more difficult .",
    "the study presented in this paper has been performed by means of a computing program that can equally well deal with semi leptonic signatures and can be switched in a straightforward manner to treat polarized scattering . moreover , by employing the new version of alpha  @xcite , which embodies also the qcd lagrangian , complete strong and electroweak results could be obtained ."
