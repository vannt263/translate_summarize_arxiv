    "the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite between string states in anti  de sitter ( ads ) space and conformal field theories in physical space - time , modified for color confinement , has led to semiclassical models for strongly - coupled qcd which provide analytical insight into its inherently non - perturbative nature , as well as predictions for hadronic spectra , decay constants , form factors and wavefunctions .",
    "we have recently shown  @xcite that there is a remarkable correspondence between the ads description of hadrons and the hamiltonian formulation of qcd in physical space - time quantized on the light front .",
    "a key feature is `` light - front holography '' which allows one to precisely map the @xmath2 solutions @xmath3 for hadronic amplitudes in the fifth dimensional variable @xmath0 to light - front hadron wavefunctions @xmath4 in physical space - time evaluated at fixed light - front time @xmath5  @xcite . for two particles @xmath6 which is conjugate to the invariant mass squared @xmath7 light - front holography",
    "thus allows hadronic amplitudes in the ads / qcd fifth dimension to be mapped to amplitudes in physical space - time .",
    "one can derive this connection by showing that one obtains the identical holographic mapping for matrix elements of the electromagnetic current and the energy - momentum tensor  @xcite .",
    "the mathematical consistency of light - front holography for both the electromagnetic and gravitational  @xcite hadronic transition matrix elements demonstrates that the mapping between the ads holographic variable @xmath0 and the light - front variable @xmath8 is a general principle .",
    "some of the important features of light - front ads / qcd include : ( a ) effective frame - independent single - particle schrdinger and dirac equations for meson and baryon wave equations in both @xmath0 and @xmath9 for example , the meson eigenvalue equation is @xmath10\\phi(z ) = { \\cal m}^2\\phi(z),\\ ] ] where the soft - wall potential has the form of a harmonic oscillator @xmath11 ( b ) the mass spectra formula for mesons at zero quark mass in the soft - wall model is @xmath12 which agrees with conventional regge phenomenology . as in the nambu string model based on a rotating flux tube , the regge slope is the same for both the principal quantum number @xmath13 and the orbital angular momentum @xmath14 .",
    "the ads / qcd correspondence thus builds in a remarkable connection between the string mass @xmath15 in the string theory underlying an effective gravity theory in the fifth dimension with the orbital angular momentum of hadrons in physical space - time .",
    "( c ) the pion is massless at zero quark mass in agreement with general arguments based on chiral symmetry .",
    "( d ) the predicted form factors for the pion and nucleons agree well with experiment .",
    "the nucleon lfwfs have both @xmath16 and @xmath17 wave components , allowing one to compute both dirac and pauli form factors . in general the ads",
    "/ qcd form factors fall off in momentum transfer squared @xmath18 with a leading power predicted by dimensional counting rules and the leading twist of the hadron s dominant interpolating operator at short distances . under conformal transformations",
    "the interpolating operators transform according to their twist , and consequently the ads isometries map the twist scaling dimensions into the ads modes  @xcite .",
    "light - front holography thus provides a simple semiclassical approximation to qcd which has both constituent counting rule behavior  @xcite at short distances and confinement at large distances  @xcite .",
    "( e ) the timelike form factors of hadrons exhibit poles in the @xmath19 vector meson channels , an analytic feature which arises from the dressed electromagnetic current in ads / qcd  @xcite .",
    "( f ) the form of the nonperturbative pion distribution amplitude @xmath20 obtained from integrating the @xmath21 valence lfwf @xmath22 over @xmath23 , has a quite different @xmath24-behavior than the asymptotic distribution amplitude predicted from the erbl pqcd evolution  @xcite of the pion distribution amplitude .",
    "the ads prediction @xmath25 has a broader distribution than expected from solving the erbl evolution equation in perturbative qcd .",
    "this observation appears to be consistent with the results of the fermilab diffractive dijet experiment  @xcite , the moments obtained from lattice qcd  @xcite , and pion form factor data  @xcite .",
    "the conversion of quark and gluon partons is usually discussed in terms of on - shell hard - scattering cross sections convoluted with _ ad hoc _ probability distributions .",
    "the lf hamiltonian formulation of quantum field theory provides a natural formalism to compute hadronization at the amplitude level  @xcite . in this case one",
    "uses light - front time - ordered perturbation theory for the qcd light - front hamiltonian to generate the off - shell quark and gluon t - matrix helicity amplitude using the lf generalization of the lippmann - schwinger formalism : @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the invariant mass squared of the intermediate state and @xmath28 is the set of interactions of the qcd lf hamiltonian in the ghost - free light - cone gauge  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath29 matrix elements are evaluated between the out and in eigenstates of @xmath30 .",
    "the lfwfs of ads / qcd can be used as the interpolating amplitudes between the off - shell quark and gluons and the bound - state hadrons . specifically , if at any stage a set of color - singlet partons has light - front kinetic energy @xmath31 , then one coalesces the virtual partons into a hadron state using the ads / qcd lfwfs .",
    "this provides a specific scheme for determining the factorization scale which matches perturbative and nonperturbative physics .",
    "the event amplitude generator is illustrated for @xmath32 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "\\(a ) since propagation in lf hamiltonian theory only proceeds as @xmath35 increases , all particles propagate as forward - moving partons with @xmath36 .",
    "there are thus relatively few contributing @xmath37ordered diagrams .",
    "\\(b ) the computer implementation can be highly efficient : an amplitude of order @xmath38 for a given process only needs to be computed once .",
    "in fact , each non - interacting cluster within @xmath29 has a numerator which is process independent ; only the lf denominators depend on the context of the process .",
    "\\(e ) the @xmath29 matrix computation allows for the effects of initial and final state interactions of the active and spectator partons .",
    "this allows for novel leading - twist phenomena such as diffractive dis , the sivers spin asymmetry and the breakdown of the pqcd lam - tung relation in drell - yan processes .",
    "this method retains the quantum mechanical information in hadronic production amplitudes which underlie bose - einstein correlations and other aspects of the spin - statistics theorem .",
    "thus einstein - podolsky - rosen quantum theory correlations are maintained , even between far - separated hadrons and clusters  @xcite .",
    "a similar off - shell t - matrix approach was used to predict antihydrogen formation from virtual positron ",
    "antiproton states produced in @xmath40 collisions  @xcite .",
