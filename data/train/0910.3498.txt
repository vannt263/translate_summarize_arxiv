    "for many years now the production of a pion by the fusion of two photons has attracted the attention of theorists and experimentalists .",
    "theoretically , the process @xmath0 can be treated within the convolution scheme of qcd@xcite by virtue of the factorization theorem which allows one to treat the photon - parton interactions within perturbative qcd , while all binding effects are separated out and absorbed into the pion distribution amplitude ( da ) .",
    "this latter ingredient has a nonperturbative origin and can , therefore , not be computed within perturbative qcd .",
    "one has to apply some nonperturbative approach to derive it or reconstruct it from the data .",
    "a widespread framework to calculate static and dynamical nonperturbative quantities of hadrons is provided by qcd sum rules with local@xcite or nonlocal condensates.@xcite this latter method was employed by us in collaboration with a.  p.bakulev ( bms)@xcite to derive a pion da that is able to give good agreement with various sets of data pertaining to various pion observables , e.g. , the electromagnetic form factor@xcite , the pion - photon transition form factor@xcite , diffractive di - jets production,@xcite etc .    while the process with two off - shell photons is theoretically the most preferable , experimentally , another kinematic situation is more accessible , notably , when one of the photons becomes real , as probed by the cello@xcite and the cleo collaborations@xcite .",
    "such a process demands more sophisticated techniques in order to take properly into account the hadronic content of the real photon .",
    "indeed , first khodjamirian,@xcite then schmedding and yakovlev,@xcite used light - cone sum rules ( lcsr)s@xcite to analyze the cleo data , a method also applied by bms up to the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) level of qcd perturbation theory.@xcite    especially the high - precision cleo data@xcite on @xmath1 give the possibility to verify the pion das quantitatively@xcite .",
    "it was found that the best agreement with the cleo data is provided by pion das which have suppressed endpoints @xmath2 , like those belonging to the `` bunch '' determined by bms in@xcite with the help of qcd sum rules with nonlocal condensates .",
    "note that the endpoint suppression is a _ sui generis _ feature of the nonlocality of the quark condensate and is controlled by the vacuum quark virtuality @xmath3  gev@xmath4.@xcite all these approaches attempt to reverse engineer the pion da from its ( first few ) moments . in the bms approach@xcite the first ten moments",
    "have been calculated , from which the corresponding gegenbauer coefficients @xmath5 with @xmath6 were determined .",
    "it turns out that all coefficients with @xmath7 are negligible , so that the proposed model da has only two coefficients : @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "recently , we@xcite extended this type of calculation to the nnlo of qcd perturbation theory by taking into account those radiative corrections at this order which are proportional to the @xmath10-function .",
    "more specifically , we used the hard - scattering amplitude of this order , computed before in ref .",
    ", in order to determine the spectral density within the lcsr approach mentioned above . in addition , we refined the phenomenological part of the sr by using a breit - wigner ansatz to model the meson resonances .",
    "below , we report about the main results of this analysis and further discuss what conclusions can be drawn by comparing the obtained predictions with all the available experimental data .",
    "we focus attention on the new babar data,@xcite which turn out to be incompatible with our predictions , indicating a violation of collinear factorization in qcd .",
    "we perform a detailed comparison of these data with the theoretical expectations and some proposed scenarios to explain them .",

    "then , one obtains the form factor in the form of a convolution by virtue of the collinear factorization:@xcite @xmath18 here the pion da @xmath19 represents a parametrization of the pion matrix element at the ( low ) factorization scale @xmath20 , whereas the amplitude @xmath21 , describing the hard parton subprocesses , can be calculated in qcd perturbation theory : @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , and with @xmath24 denoting the twist - four contribution . in leading order ( lo ) of the strong coupling and taking into account the twist - four term explicitly , one has@xcite @xmath25 & & \\label{eq : t_0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath26 and @xmath27 . the pion da of twist - two , @xmath19 ,",
