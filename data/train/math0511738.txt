    "( since teichmller curves are never complete ( @xcite ) , triangle groups @xmath21 with @xmath22 do not occur . )",
    "we use a different construction from previous authors ; we construct the family @xmath14 of curves defined by @xmath3 rather than the individual veech surface ( which is a fiber of @xmath14 ) .",
    "however , starting from our description , we compute an algebraic equation for the corresponding veech surface . the family @xmath14 is given as the quotient of an abelian cover @xmath23 by a finite group .    under the simplifying assumption that @xmath24 and @xmath25 is odd ,",
