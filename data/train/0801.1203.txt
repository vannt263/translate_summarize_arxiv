    "in fact , the solar wind provides a unique laboratory for studying high - reynolds - number magnetohydrodynamic turbulence ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "one of the main problems in the studies of incompressible hydrodynamical turbulence is explaining the statistics of velocity fluctuations on different length scales .",
    "in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence this problem concerns in general also magnetic field and density fluctuations .",
    "conventionally , in investigations of a turbulent cascade , statistical properties of fluctuations @xmath0 of a physical quantity @xmath1 are examined , where @xmath2 is temporal ( or spatial ) scale .",
    "the fluctuations are studied by examining their probability distribution functions ( p.d.f . ) @xmath3 or @xmath4-order moments @xmath5 of the distributions , called also structure functions .",
    "often , if the root - mean - square of velocity fluctuations is small as compared to the mean velocity of the flow , one can use the taylor hypothesis , interpreting the temporal variation @xmath6 at a fixed position as a spatial variation @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a spatial scale corresponding to the temporal scale @xmath2 . in an intermittent turbulent cascade , the p.d.f . of the fluctuations",
    "is non - gaussian at small scales .",

    "changes , and finally there is a scale @xmath9 , such that for @xmath10 the p.d.f . is close to gaussian distribution @xcite .",
    "a number of models for the scaling exponents and scaling of the probability distributions of the fluctuations have been proposed .",
    "many papers have been also devoted to experimental verification of the proposed models ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "recently , a great deal of attention has been devoted to investigations of the fluctuations in hydrodynamic turbulence from the point of view of the markov processes theory ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular",
    ", results of the verification of the validity of the chapman - kolmogorov equation as well as estimations of the kramers - moyal coefficients from experimental data suggest that the markov processes approach may be appropriate to the description and modeling of the turbulent cascade @xcite .",
    "the estimations of the kramers - moyal coefficients allow to determine the form of the fokker - planck equation governing the evolution of the probability distribution with scale for the fluctuations .",
    "a model based on a fokker - planck equation has been recently proposed for solar wind turbulence , but for fluctuations of quantities that exhibit self - similar scaling @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "the markov processes approach for the first time has been applied to analysis of intermittent solar wind turbulence .",
    "this approach seems to provide a contact point between pure statistics and dynamical systems approach to turbulence .",
    "in the plasma flow expanding from the sun into the interplanetary space we can distinguish several forms , in particular the slow ( @xmath11 km / s ) and fast ( @xmath12 km / s ) solar wind ( see , e.g. , ref . @xcite and references therein ) . at the solar minimum the two forms",
    "are usually well separated , the fast wind is more homogeneous and incompressible in comparison with the slow wind . our goal here is to study properties of the turbulent cascade , therefore we try to exclude effects associated with nonstationary driving and spatial inhomogeneity of the turbulence .",
    "for this reason , in this paper we have chosen for analysis the fast solar wind flowing from non - active high - latitude regions in the solar corona at the solar minimum .",
    "this data set represents dynamics of fast solar wind free of dynamical interaction with slow wind , as possibly the most homogeneous and probably also most stationary case . therefore effects associated with nonstationary driving should be eliminated here to a large extent , and we should observe a state possibly closest to freely decaying turbulence , which seems to be the most appropriate case to study the turbulent cascade . since we would like to examine fluctuations in a wide range of scales , including small scales , we focus here on magnetic field fluctuations , which are available at much better time resolution in comparison with measurements of plasma parameters ( e.g. , bulk velocity or density of the plasma ) . however , we are aware of the importance of detailed analysis of other types of the solar wind , as well as other bulk plasma parameters , and we are going to carry out such studies in a future .",
    "the data set analyzed here consists of about @xmath13 measurements of the radial component @xmath14 of the magnetic field obtained by the ulysses spacecraft from 70:1996 to 230:1996 ( day of year : year ) at time resolution of one second ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the description of the experimental setup ) .",
    "the measurements have been obtained at heliospheric latitudes from 29 to 44 degree and at radial distance from the sun from 3.5 to 4.2 au .",
    "small gaps ( up to three missing points ) in the data set have been filled using linear interpolation . further in this paper we consider fluctuations of the radial component of the magnetic field defined as @xmath15 . presenting results of our analysis",
    ", we do not recast the fluctuations into the space domain via the taylor hypothesis , i.e. , we consistently use here temporal scales .",
    "however , since we analyze highly supersonic and super - alfvnic flow ( mean velocity @xmath16 km / s in the reference system moving with the measuring instrument ) , the temporal scales physically should be interpreted rather as spatial scales .",
    "assuming that the taylor hypothesis is satisfied here , one can easily transform the temporal scale @xmath2 to the spatial scale @xmath8 using the relationship @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "however , since ulysses spacecraft provides one - point measurements of the magnetic field , in general it is not possible to distinguish between temporal and spatial variations in this case .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectr ] we show the power spectrum of the radial component     for comparison . ]    of the magnetic field .",
    "as one can see , the power spectrum has a power - law character with spectral exponent very close to -5/3 in the inertial range identified here as stretching approximately from 0.0002 to 0.075 hz .",

    "there is a good agreement between experimental probability distributions and those computed from the fokker - planck equation .",

    "therefore , we can conclude that for intermittent solar wind turbulence , the markov processes approach can provide a mathematical formalism capable of explaining specific evolution of the shape of the probability distribution with scale changing from energy containing scale down to dissipation scale .",
    "since the formalism describes properly evolution of the probability distribution with scale , obviously this should also work for structure functions , which are defined as appropriate moments of the probability distributions .",
    "admittedly , direct analytical derivation of scaling properties of the structure functions can be difficult , but we expect that such studies can be done numerically .",
    "every markov process must satisfy the chapman - kolmogorov equation ( [ eq : chk ] ) , which express the condition that the probability density of transition from scale @xmath39 to @xmath40 , can be subdivided into smaller steps , that is transition from scale @xmath39 to @xmath41 , and then from scale @xmath41 to @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , in the case of a turbulent cascade , fulfillment of the chapman - kolmogorov equation can be interpreted as the presence of a local transfer mechanism in wave vector space .",
    "the question of locality of the energy transfer is of some interest , e.g. , in the studies of dynamo mechanism to generate magnetic fields in astrophysical objects , where in helical mhd turbulence , nonlocal processes of generation of large - scale fields by small - scale helicities are studied in details ( see , e.g. , sec .",
    "6.2.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the question is also important for modeling mhd flows and numerical simulations , e.g. , in large - eddy simulations , where low - pass filtering with respect to a cutoff wave number requires some assumptions concerning the transfer of energy around the cutoff wavenumber .",
    "local and nonlocal transfer mechanisms can be distinguished in theoretical studies of turbulence via shell models or numerical simulations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but it is very difficult to study the property of turbulence using experimental data . the markov processes approach seems to provide such a method .",
    "namely , analyzing a time series from a turbulent flow we should be able to identify the character of the dominating transfer mechanism for a given quantity or between different quantities , i.e. , we should be able to answer the question whether the mechanism is local or nonlocal .",
    "since our results suggest rather the markovian character of the turbulent cascade in the solar wind , it indicates that the local transfer mechanism dominates in solar wind turbulence .",
    "therefore dominating transfer of magnetic field fluctuations has similar character as in the case of kolmogorov phenomenology describing turbulence in neutral fluids , where according to the picture of richardson cascade , the energy transfer has local character in the wave vector space , i.e. , the energy at a scale @xmath8 is transfered mainly to comparable scales @xcite .",
    "this result is somewhat surprising , because we analyze here magnetohydrodynamic turbulence , which is rather magnetic field dominated case .",
    "therefore , according to the classical iroshnikov - kraichnan picture , due to the alfvn effect , we should expect nonlocal influence of large - scale magnetic field on small - scale turbulent eddies , and so also nonlocal interactions between modes @xcite .",
    "however , results of recent numerical simulations suggest that local transfer mechanisms are present in mhd turbulence @xcite .",
    "our paper provides experimental results confirming this observation for magnetic - to - magnetic field transfer ."
