    "many phenomenological studies on susy particle searches have been performed in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with real susy parameters . in general , however , some of the susy parameters may be complex , in particular the higgsino mass parameter @xmath9 , the gaugino mass parameters @xmath10 and the trilinear scalar coupling parameters @xmath11 of the sfermions @xmath12 .",
    "the su(2 ) gaugino mass parameter @xmath13 can be chosen real after an appropriate redefinition of the fields .",
    "not only the cp - violating observables ( such as fermion edms ) but also the cp - conserving observables ( such as cross sections and decay branching ratios ) depend on the phases of the complex parameters , because in general the mass - eigenvalues and the couplings of the susy particles involved are functions of the underlying complex parameters .",
    "for example , the decay branching ratios of the staus @xmath14 and @xmath15-sneutrino @xmath16 can be quite sensitive to the complex phases of the stau and gaugino - higgsino sectors @xcite .",
    "therefore , in a complete phenomenological analysis of production and decays of the susy particles one has to take into account that @xmath11 , @xmath9 and @xmath17 can be complex . in this article based on @xcite",
