    "the highly successful cold dark matter ( cdm ) model idealizes the thermal motions of dark matter particles as negligible on all scales at high redshift . in this model ,",
    "perturbation modes on all scales are gravitationally unstable , leading to hierarchical structure formation in which nonlinear structures such as halos assemble through numerous mergers .",
    "numerical simulations of structure formation within cdm models indicate that halos are predicted to have steep central density profiles , with logarithmic slopes @xmath1 on the smallest resolved scales ( see @xcite for a recent example ) .    in many dm models , however , the dm temperature is nonzero , which can affect the properties of dm halos in multiple ways .",
    "for example , a finite dm temperature suppresses the abundance of low - mass halos .",
    "this occurs because , following freezeout of dark matter interactions , dm particles freely stream over some distance determined by their thermal velocities , and density fluctuations on scales below this free - streaming scale @xmath2 are highly suppressed . roughly speaking",
    ", the smallest halos that arise are expected to have masses of order @xmath3 , although n - body simulations have not definitively ruled out the formation of at least some halos below @xmath4 through non - hierarchical processes like fragmentation @xcite .    besides this suppression of the abundance of halos",
    ", a nonzero dm temperature also can affect the central density profiles of the halos that do form .",
    "one elegant way to see this is to note that the dm phase space density is finite if the dm temperature is finite , and since dm is taken to be collisionless , then liouville s theorem guarantees that the phase space density can not increase .",
    "hence , the phase space density is bounded within dm halos @xcite , which implies that the central slope of the dm density profile must vanish ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in other words , halos are expected to have central cores if the dm is not cold .",
    "note that this effect is caused by the finite dm temperature at the time of formation of the halo , and is not due to the truncation of the small - scale linear power spectrum @xcite .",
    "therefore , increasing the dm temperature has the effect of suppressing the number of low - mass halos , and of producing central cores in dm halos .",
    "observationally , there may be evidence for both of these effects .",
    "the observed number of local group satellite galaxies falls well below the thousands of dm subhalos found in cdm simulations of halos like our galaxy s ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "in addition , the 21 cm rotation curves of certain galaxies , in particular low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies , appear better fit by cored dm profiles than cuspy dm profiles ( see @xcite for a recent discussion ) . for these reasons ,",
    "there has been considerable interest in the literature in investigating structure formation in models where dm is not perfectly cold . in so - called warm dark matter ( wdm )",
    "models , the dm temperature is chosen to make the free - streaming scale correspond to subgalactic scales , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "wdm models have become increasingly disfavored in recent years , in large part because of constraints on the matter power spectrum derived from the lyman-@xmath6 forest flux power spectrum @xcite . the observational support for wdm models from dwarfs and lsb galaxies",
    "has also eroded , as faint local group satellites have been discovered in increasing numbers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) thanks to the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "recently , @xcite have argued that the large cores apparently observed in certain lsb galaxies can not all be due to wdm , since the implied central phase space densities in these systems are not universal , but instead show large variations from object to object .",
    "this suggests an astrophysical origin for claimed detections of central cores , and mechanisms to produce such cores have been proposed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present yet another argument against wdm as the origin of large cores in halo density profiles . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "the inferred core radii in several lsb galaxies are large fractions of the halo virial radii , @xmath7 .",
    "as mentioned above , such large cores do not arise in cdm models , and so we might naturally consider producing large cores by raising the dm temperature .",
    "making the dm warm , however , has the side effect of wiping out small halos , and so it is not obvious that raising the dm temperature can generate halos with large @xmath8 .",
    "we can , however , use a simple argument to make an order - of - magnitude estimate of this ratio .",
    "consider a wdm particle of mass @xmath9 and typical momentum @xmath10 .",
    "following freezeout , its momentum redshifts as @xmath11 , so let us write @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the velocity today at @xmath14 ( since wdm must be nonrelativistic today , @xmath15 ) .",
    "the particle s velocity is then @xmath16 ( using units where @xmath17 ) . neglecting accelerations caused by gravitational potential fluctuations , the particle freely streams a comoving distance @xmath18 where we assume @xmath19 .",
    "this distance encloses mass @xmath3 , and as noted above , the smallest halos that form will have masses of order @xmath4 .",
    "the virial velocities of these halos at their formation epoch @xmath20 are @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the virial overdensity . now , because the thermal velocity @xmath23 at expansion factor @xmath20 is nonzero , infalling particles will not fall directly towards the halo center , but instead have a nonzero impact parameter , and the typical impact parameter determines the core size . naively , we might expect that at formation ( @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 following formation , any subsequent growth in halo mass can only decrease the core radius , while the virial radius can only increase . indeed ,",
    "even if the mass distribution around the halo is static , with no accretion following formation , the virial radius will still grow in time proportionally to the expansion factor @xmath26 , because the expansion of the universe dilutes the background mean matter density .",
    "this is the reason why halo concentrations correlate with halo formation times in cdm cosmologies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , following the formation epoch @xmath20 , the ratio @xmath27/@xmath28 must diminish in time at least as fast as @xmath29 ; any mass accretion will only decrease this ratio even faster . assuming no growth , then at the present time ( @xmath30 ) @xmath31 this ratio is maximized by delaying halo formation as late as possible .",
    "for typical parameters , and setting @xmath32 , this gives @xmath33 observed today .",
    "from this simple order - of - magnitude estimate , it appears unlikely that wdm models can produce sufficiently large core radii to explain lsb galaxies .",
    "this argument is only approximate , however . to make further progress ,",
    "we have performed calculations of halo formation in wdm models .",
    "our results indicate that wdm halo cores are broadly consistent with ( though typically smaller than ) the above estimate , which precludes wdm as an explanation for the large cores that are claimed to exist in certain lsb galaxies .",
    "in this section we describe our numerical method to solve for the self - consistent halo density profile following collapse .",
    "we eschew conventional n - body simulations , since for feasible simulation parameters the core radii will typically be unresolved or ( at best ) marginally resolved @xcite . since we are interested in studying the behavior on scales smaller than the typical resolution limits of conventional n - body simulations , we have instead employed an alternative approach similar to that used by @xcite .",
    "we calculate the collapse of isolated peaks in an expanding universe . to isolate the effects of the nonzero wdm temperature during halo collapse",
    ", we focus on the case of spherical collapse . this problem has been investigated previously in the literature , and it is straightforward to show that cold , spherical collapse gives halos with central density profiles behaving as @xmath34 , or steeper @xcite . because cold spherical collapse is well - understood , any departures from @xmath35 profiles are clearly due to the effects of warm collapse . by newton s theorem , our calculations neglect the effects of the local environment of peaks , which cause peaks to collapse nonspherically . we know from previous cosmological wdm simulations , however , that accounting for the effects of local environment does not lead to large cores in wdm halos @xcite .    for a given potential @xmath36 , assumed to be spherically symmetric , we integrate the equations of motion to solve for the orbit @xmath37 for each particle . given the orbit @xmath37 , we compute the mass profile deposited by each particle .",
    "we compute orbits for many particles , and sum over all their deposited mass profiles to obtain the total mass profile @xmath38 , and the total density @xmath39 .",
    "then , we repeat this procedure , using the newly obtained mass profile , and iterate to convergence .",
    "we initialize this procedure using linear perturbation theory .",
    "we start with a linear density profile @xmath40 describing the initial peak at the starting epoch @xmath41 . here , @xmath42  is a comoving lagrangian radius , to be distinguished from the proper eulerian radius @xmath43 at subsequent times .",
    "we choose the initial peak profile to be proportional to the ( linear theory ) matter correlation function , @xmath44 .",
    "this corresponds to the average profile of high peaks in the @xmath45 limit @xcite , and so this profile should be typical of the first halos to form in wdm cosmologies .",

    "however , we find that wdm core radii are generically small , typically of order @xmath80 of the halo virial radius at the time of formation , and considerably smaller following formation .",
    "this is for halos forming at the cutoff scale ; higher mass halos will have substantially smaller @xmath107 .",
    "we have investigated the dependence of the core radius on various physical parameters such as the wdm temperature , halo formation redshift , and halo mass . for the allowed range of wdm temperatures ( e.g. @xmath148 )",
    ", the core radii of halos observed at @xmath14 are generically expected to be far smaller than the core sizes measured in certain lsb galaxies , with @xmath149 .",
    "our calculations have all assumed spherical symmetry , whereas halo formation in both cdm and wdm cosmologies is highly nonspherical .",
    "we would argue , however , that our conclusions regarding wdm cores are likely to be valid for non - spherical collapse as well .",
    "one line of evidence supporting this argument is the fact that the pseudo - phase - space density profiles of our halos are quite similar to the profiles of halos in cdm simulations , with @xmath150 , roughly speaking @xcite .",
    "this similarity is presumably a consequence of the virial theorem , which ensures that @xmath151 . for wdm halos , the power - law rise of the pseudo - phase - space density towards small @xmath43 saturates",
    "when @xmath88 approaches the tremaine - gunn bound , and this saturation will occur for both spherical and nonspherical collapse .",
    "now , we would expect the value of the pseudo - phase - space density to be similar at the virial radius for both spherical and non - spherical collapse , since the halo mass and virial radius are by definition the same in the two cases , and so @xmath152 and @xmath153 will be similar for the two cases .",
    "we have noted that @xmath88 rises as roughly @xmath35 inside the virial radius in spherical and nonspherical collapse , and in both cases the core radius occurs where @xmath88 approaches the tremaine - gunn bound .",
    "so we have good reason to believe that halo core radii will not be significantly larger for nonspherical collapse than for spherical collapse , just because the @xmath88 profiles appear similar .    the other possible loophole in our argument",
    "is that we have assumed that no halos form below the cutoff scale in the power spectrum .",
    "n - body simulations have not yet conclusively determined whether or not halos with @xmath154 arise in wdm cosmologies , due to numerical difficulties associated with simulating truncated power spectra @xcite .",
    "we have begun investigating this issue , and our preliminary results indicate that halos may form below the cutoff scale , though it is unclear whether they can form in sufficient numbers to account for observed lsb galaxies .",
    "our results indicate that warm dark matter cosmologies can not produce halos with core radii large enough to account for the density profiles of observed lsb galaxies .",
    "this would suggest that the origin of these observed cores lies within astrophysics , rather than particle physics ."
