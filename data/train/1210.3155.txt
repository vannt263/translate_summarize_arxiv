    "<S> , we first simulate the relaxation processes around b - form structure after sudden changes of the external torques , where slow relaxation @xmath0 as a function of the elapsed time @xmath1 is observed . </S>",
    "<S> then , the dynamics of structural transition from z form to b form is computed under various external torque strength . for small external torques </S>",
    "<S> , the transition proceeds via nucleation and the growth , while for higher torques , z - form structure becomes unstable , and the transition mechanism is switched to a spinodal - like process . </S>",
    "<S> these numerical results are qualitatively understood by simple phenomenological arguments . </S>"
