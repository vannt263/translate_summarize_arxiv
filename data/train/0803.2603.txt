    "moreover , the shapes may be needed to resolve possible ambiguities in mass determinations from kinematic endpoints  @xcite , they are crucial for the spin determination  @xcite , and they allow to test models of supersymmetry breaking @xcite .",

    ", the lepton from the slepton decay is relatively low - energetic .",
    "thus the `` far '' lepton adds to the distribution only at low invariant masses and the signature of the `` near '' lepton is still significant at high invariant masses .",

    "the energy of the negatively charged lepton @xmath132 is therefore , on average , reduced in the squark rest frame for polarized @xmath21 decays . for both reasons ,",
    "the @xmath133 $ ] invariant mass is reduced on average compared to the prediction without spin correlations  @xcite .",
    "the reduction is slightly enhanced by gluon emission as demonstrated in the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : inv_mass ] . the distribution for the sum of `` near '' and `` far '' @xmath132 leptons is shown in the lower right panel .",
    "its shape can easily be distinguished from the @xmath100 results at large invariant masses .",
    "spin correlations are clearly important for the description of the invariant mass distributions ; without taking spin correlations into account , all panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : inv_mass ] would be identical .        comparing the final distributions in the lower panels an asymmetry between positively and negatively charged leptons ,",
    "@xmath134 is predicted indeed  @xcite .",
    "[ the asymmetry is washed out somewhat in @xmath135 collisions at the lhc where also anti - squarks @xmath136 are produced ; see section  [ ssec : pp ] ] .",
    "[ fig : asym ] shows the parton - level asymmetry for the @xmath11 decay chain in sps1a@xmath14 .",
    "in particular for high invariant masses the dominance of positively charged leptons is evident . the nlo sqcd radiative corrections included in our decay analysis have a very small influence on the asymmetry .",
    "this is evident from the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : inv_mass ] ; near the kinematic endpoint where the corrections to the invariant mass distribution of the positively charged lepton are biggest , the asymmetry is close to unity and changes are marginal as a result .",
    "the    more detailed numerical analysis presented in this final section is also based on the reference point sps1a@xmath14 @xcite in the msugra scenario .",
    "this point is located in the transition zone from the bulk to the coannihilation region in the @xmath137 $ ] gaugino / scalar mass plane .",
    "it corresponds to the region of maximum probability in the analysis of electroweak precision observables @xcite , driven by the contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath138 ; the reference point is compatible with the wmap measurement of the density of cold dark matter .",
    "the parameters of this msugra scenario are defined as follows : gaugino mass @xmath139 gev , scalar mass @xmath140 gev , and trilinear coupling @xmath141 gev at the unification scale ; moreover @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "after evolution down to the terascale the squark , gluino , slepton , and neutralino masses that will be used in the phenomenological analysis are collected in table  [ ta : sps_masses ] . while suspect  @xcite has been employed for the computation of the entries in the table , the spheno  @xcite and softsusy  @xcite spectra are quite similar , with differences at the level of 1% and less .",
    "table  [ ta : sps_masses ] also presents the branching ratios which are based on nlo calculations as implemented in susyhit  @xcite / sdecay  @xcite . the @xmath10-squarks decay predominantly into the charginos @xmath144 and the neutralino @xmath145 .",
    "@xmath16-squarks decay almost exclusively into the @xmath131 lsp which is bino - like .",
    "hence , almost all of the squarks decaying to @xmath19 are indeed @xmath10-type squarks .",

    "( [ eq : asym ] ) , generated by the @xmath145 decay chain . more than half ( _ i.e. _ 57% ) of the neutralinos @xmath145 decay visibly into charged slepton - lepton - pairs .",
    "since left - handed sleptons of the first two generations are heavy , the decays are dominated ( @xmath146 ) by decays into mixed @xmath147 states @xcite with a reduced mass eigen - value , but still a significant fraction decays to @xmath148 ( @xmath149 for each mode ) . if the @xmath150 leptonic decays are used as experimental signals , the transverse momenta of the cascading @xmath151 final states are strongly reduced .",
    "a large fraction of the @xmath151 decay events will thus be lost in experimental cuts , about 90% for a transverse momentum cut of 10 gev .",
    "since experiments will not distinguish quark from anti - quark jets , experimentally observable distributions will also receive contributions from anti - squark decay chains . for anti - squarks , by @xmath152-invariance , the r@xmath153le of positively and negatively charged leptons is interchanged and the asymmetry @xmath154 is reduced as a result . at the tevatron , the equal rate for squark and anti - squark production even drives @xmath154 to zero .",
    "however , the ( non-@xmath152-invariant ) proton - proton initial state at the lhc ensures that more squarks than anti - squarks are produced and a non - zero asymmetry is predicted .    at the lhc ,",
    "squarks are produced either directly in quark / anti - quark / gluon collisions , or they are decay products of gluinos as @xmath155 for the sps1a@xmath14 reference point .",
