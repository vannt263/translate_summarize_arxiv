    "for the three - spin chain , @xmath101 , the effects of the absence of translational symmetry in the chain are even more dramatic , leading to qualitatively different dynamical behaviors of the spins on the chain ends from that of the spin at the center . for both signs of @xmath1",

    ". it would be interesting to see if such differences are indeed maintained for larger spin chains and for larger spin clusters with two or more heisenberg spin exchange interactions .    for the four - spin ring with equal near - neighbor exchange couplings @xmath1 , the single autocorrelation function @xmath139 has a single mode that approaches the fixed frequency @xmath246 as @xmath158 , in addition to the afm ( fm ) mode of the four - spin equivalent neighbor model with a frequency that approaches 0 ( @xmath247 ) .",
    "@xcite none of these is a central peak at @xmath248 .",
    "the isosceles triangle has a much richer spectrum of four modes , with tunable frequencies that depend upon @xmath22 , and a central peak for a semi - infinite range of @xmath22 values .",
    "in addition , at the onset of the central peak , that mode form exhibits low-@xmath0 frequency scaling , instead of the time scaling present in the afm equivalent neighbor and four - spin ring models , and it is a scaling function of a differently scaled frequency than in the fm equivalent neighbor model and four - spin ring.@xcite the simplest integrable four - spin system with dynamics similar to that of the isosceles triangle is the squashed tetrahedron , which also involves two different near - neighbor exchange couplings .",
    "@xcite    inelastic neutron scattering experiments on large single crystals would be a particularly useful technique to observe the effects predicted here . by appropriately varying the scattering wave vector , all four of the @xmath153",
    "can be measured as functions of @xmath128 and @xmath0 .",
    "although experimental observation of the predicted low-@xmath0 modes might be difficult , since quantum effects are expected to dominate at very low @xmath0 , the presence of such modes for three classical heisenberg spins on an isosceles triangle underscores the qualitative changes that occur with different exchange couplings .",
