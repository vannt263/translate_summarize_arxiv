    "our current knowledge of particle physics comprises three light neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , which mix and form the three flavor eigenstates @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "a number of observations , however , suggest the existence of sterile neutrino states .",
    "these would not interact at all with other particles in the standard model ( sm ) , but could mix with the active neutrinos and form additional neutrino mass eigenstates  @xcite .",
    "for example , a natural way to incorporate neutrino masses into the sm is by introducing a right - handed counterpart to the purely left - handed active neutrinos .",
    "right - handed neutrinos can not couple to the weak force carriers , and hence can only be observed via their oscillation to left - handed neutrino states .    without violating gauge invariance of the sm , a majorana mass term for the right - handed neutrino",
    "can be introduced . since no electroweak symmetry breaking",
    "is required for this mass term ( i.  e.  no higgs mechanism ) , it can have an arbitrary scale .",
    "the puzzling fact that neutrinos are six orders of magnitude lighter than all other fermions can be explained by choosing a rather high scale for this mass term , naturally creating the known light neutrino mass eigenstates and additional very heavy neutrino mass eigenstates  @xcite .",
    "another observations motivating the existence of additional neutrino states are recent anomalies in reactor and short - baseline experiments .",
    "these might be resolved by the existence of additional light sterile neutrinos mass eigenstates with a mass of @xmath10  ev  @xcite .",
    "( the speed of light c , and the planck constant @xmath11 are set to unity in this paper . )    in this paper , we focus on sterile neutrinos in the mass range of a few kev , which are motivated by cosmological observations .",
    "these neutrinos would be one of the most promising candidates for both warm ( wdm ) and cold dark matter ( cdm )  @xcite .",
    "the existence of wdm would reconcile recent structure observations from sub - galactic to larger scales .",
    "for example , the tension between the predicted and measured number of dwarf satellite galaxies in the @xmath12cdm concordance model of cosmology can be mitigated by adding a sizable contribution of wdm  @xcite .",
    "current cosmological observations limit the mass @xmath13 and the active - to - sterile neutrino mixing angle @xmath14 of kev - scale sterile neutrinos to 1 kev @xmath15 50 kev and @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , recent analyses of xmm newton telescope x - ray data show a very weak unidentified emission line from stacked galaxy cluster which could be possibly explained by the decay of a sterile neutrino with @xmath17 and active - to - sterile neutrino mixing of @xmath18 .",
    "similar results have been reported for x - ray spectra of the andromeda galaxy and the perseus cluster  @xcite .",
    "a small admixture of a kev - scale sterile neutrino mass eigenstate to the electron neutrino @xmath19 would manifest itself in high resolution @xmath0 spectroscopy : at a specific energy below the endpoint corresponding to the kev - scale sterile neutrino mass @xmath13 the reaction kinematics provide enough energy for emission of a heavy sterile neutrino mass eigenstate along with the electron .",
    "the opening of this new reaction channel thus results in a distinctive kink - like signature in the energy spectrum  @xcite .",
    "this paper details an investigation of using wavelet transforms to detect the spectral distortion from active - to - sterile neutrino mixing in tritium @xmath0 decays .",
    "it is shown that a statistical sensitivity to mixing angles @xmath20 ( 90% cl ) can be achieved with the statistics equivalent to three full beam years expected from a katrin - like @xmath0-decay experiment  @xcite .",

    "it will be shown that a differential measurement with high energy resolution is necessary to reach this sensitivity .",
    "this section describes the imprint of kev - scale sterile neutrinos on the tritium @xmath0-decay spectrum .",

    "we outline necessary modifications to the experiment in order to probe the region in the @xmath0-decay spectrum where the signature of active - to - sterile neutrino mixing can be expected .      in the super - allowed @xmath0 decay of tritium @xmath21 an electron ( anti-)neutrino eigenstate is created , which is a superposition of different mass eigenstates . correspondingly , the @xmath0-decay spectrum is a superposition of spectra corresponding to the single mass eigenstates . since the mass splittings between the known light mass eigenstates @xmath22",
    "are too small to be resolved experimentally , an effective electron neutrino mass @xmath23 is measured , where @xmath24 represent elements of the pmns matrix  @xcite .    in the case where the electron neutrino contains an admixture of a neutrino mass eigenstate with a mass @xmath25 in the kev range , the different mass eigenstates will no longer form one effective neutrino mass term . in this case , due to",

    "the spectrometer operates as a so - called mac - e filter ( agnetic diabatic ollimation combined with an lectrostatic filter ) , providing an energy resolution of @xmath34  ev .",

    "we investigate the performance of a wavelet analysis of the tritium @xmath0-decay spectrum in detecting the kink - like signature of a kev - scale sterile neutrino .",
    "we consider the two described measurement modes , different energy resolutions , and the effect of uncertainties on the spectral shape .",
    "there is a wealth of literature on using different transformation techniques in signal processing .",
    "one of the most well - known methods is the fourier transform , which transforms a time - dependent signal into the frequency domain .",
    "the fourier transform provides a constant resolution for all frequencies depending on the signal length .",
    "although the frequency components in the signal are known after a fourier transform , there is no information on the point in time where a certain frequency appears in the signal .",
    "in contrast , a wavelet transform is a technique that offers both time and frequency resolution  @xcite .",
    "a wavelet transform performs a convolution of specific window functions , so - called wavelets , with the given signal .",
    "in contrast to the sinusoidal basis functions of the fourier transform , wavelets offer the major advantage of being localized in time and frequency . changing the wavelet s position in the transformation of the signal",
    "provides the time resolution , while modulation of the wavelet length leads to the frequency resolution .    in this section a short overview of the continuous and the discrete wavelet transform , which is the basis for the analysis in this paper , is presented .",
    "the continuous wavelet transform ( cwt ) of a continuous function @xmath37 is defined as @xmath38 in this notation  @xcite , @xmath39 is the set of wavelets with the _ scale _ parameter @xmath40 , the _ translation _ parameter @xmath41 .",
    "the wavelets are calculated from a _ mother wavelet _ @xmath42 .",
    "the set of wavelets is given by @xmath43 where scale parameter @xmath40 describes the size and thereby the frequency band of the wavelet .",
    "small scales refer to high frequencies and large scales refer to small frequencies .",
    "the translation parameter @xmath41 shifts the wavelet relatively to the signal allowing an examination at different points of time .",
    "thus , the cwt of a signal provides a two - dimensional spectrum with time ( translation ) and frequency ( scale ) resolution .      to compute the discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) , several successive high - pass and low - pass filters are applied to a discrete time - domain signal . in the first step ,",
    "the high - pass filter determines the amount ( power ) of high frequencies ( corresponding to `` scale 1 '' ) at certain times in the signal .",
    "scale 1 covers the frequency range from half the maximal frequency @xmath44 to the maximal frequency @xmath45 .",
    "the low - pass filter eliminates these high frequencies and returns a smoothed signal .    in the second step ,",
    "the wavelet transform acts on the smoothed signal : the high - pass filter determines the amount of frequencies , corresponding to `` scale 2 '' , in the smoothed signal and the low - pass filter subtracts these and returns a further smoothed signal .",
    "scale 2 covers a smaller frequency range than scale 1 , namely @xmath46 to @xmath44 .",
    "this _ pyramidic algorithm _ , visualized in figure  [ fig : subbandcoding ] , is repeated successively until the signal is reduced to only two values .    by applying this strategy of sub - band coding ,",
    "the frequency resolution increases by a factor of two in each step while the time resolution decreases by the same factor .",
    "hence , dwt has a good frequency resolution for low frequencies and a good time resolution for high frequencies .        in our analysis",
    ", we implemented the dwt as a matrix transformation  @xcite performing the successive high- and low - pass filtering on the data vector . in our case , the data vector describes the tritium @xmath0-decay spectrum from @xmath47  kev with 512 points .",
