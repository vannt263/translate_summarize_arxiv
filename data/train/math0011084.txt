    "this is only possible if @xmath96 is an orthonormal basis for @xmath22 , i.e. if @xmath97 are the inverses of the eigenvalues of @xmath90 .",
    "as will see bellow , even in the case when the inclusion @xmath48 is @xmath21 , with a trace on @xmath22 has to be handled by a rather a complicated machinery .",
    "indeed in this case the above subfactor is the fixed algebra under the action of @xmath98 on @xmath86 ( here @xmath98 acts trivially on q and by conjugation on @xmath99 .",
    "this is because the element @xmath100 is invariant under the product action of the group @xmath98 and all the others are obtained by intercalation or concatenation from this element ( @xcite ) .",
    "we generalize bellow the above construction to the case when the trace on @xmath22 is replaced by a state .",
    "first we record the following well known folklore lemma .",

    "this construction allows to obtain irreducible subfactors , in factors with non - trivial fundamental group , of index values in @xmath8 starting from the inclusion @xmath21 .",
    "we will describe this factors explicitly .",

    "let @xmath27 be a diffuse abelian von neumann algebra or a type @xmath3 factor with faithful trace @xmath28 and let @xmath112 be the amalgamated free product factor obtained by taking the gns - construction corresponding to the given state on @xmath113 and the trace @xmath28 .",

    "this is basically proved in @xcite,@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the only additional care comes from the fact that we are dealing with a state instead of a trace .",
    "but since @xmath117 are chosen in the centralizer of the state it follows that @xmath6 is a type @xmath3 factor . the main part of the argument ( the markovianity of the trace ) follows from the fact that the conditional expectation of the algebra @xmath118 onto @xmath6 is the algebra of scalars , which follows from the properties of the pimsner popa basis .",
    "it is not clear if the above factor is the same as the one constructed in @xcite starting from the inclusion derived from the temperly - lieb algebra for index values bigger than 4 . in that case",
    "the algebras stay in a much larger amalgamated free product , since the pimsner - popa basis sits in hyperfinite factor ( and can not be chosen to belong to a finite dimensional algebra ) .",
    "[ addsteps ] to obtain any additional step in the jones basic construction of the above inclusion one has to proceed as follows .",
    "one starts with the iterated jones s basic construction of @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is endowed as above with the state @xmath83 .",

    "let @xmath124be the corresponding jones projections , indexed so that @xmath125 is exactly the jones projection for @xmath126    then we perform the same construction as above for @xmath48 ( instead of @xmath127 ) .",
    "we get a subfactor inclusion @xmath116 .",
    "the iterated jones basic construction steps ( up to @xmath128 ) are then obtained by adding consecutively the projections @xmath129 .",
    "as we will see bellow by reducing by a minimal projection in @xmath52 it follows that these subfactors are isomorphic to the original ones .",
    "in particular it follows that the factor and subfactor are allways isomorphic to the algebra corresponding to @xmath90 and @xmath123    [ lemde.4 ] let @xmath130 be a state on @xmath22 with @xmath131 , where @xmath90 is diagonal with eigenvalues list @xmath132 .",

    "since this is the basic construction for @xmath21 we can apply lemma [ lemde.1 ] and one obtains an equivalent description of the subfactor @xmath135 sitting in @xmath86 .",
    "since @xmath141 is a pimsner - popa basis for the inclusion @xmath21 , the result follows . that the subfactor inclusion is of type @xmath46 is proved in a more general context in @xcite .    by analogy with the case of traces , we have the following result which shows that the algebra obtained by popa s construction from the inclusion of finite dimensional algebras ( with states ) , @xmath142 is a minimal fixed point algebra .",
    "[ thede.5 ] let @xmath58 be the function algebra of woronowicz quantum group @xmath11 and let @xmath143 be finite dimensional unitary representation of dimension @xmath144 .",
    "assume that the operator @xmath145 associated to the representation as in @xcite , @xcite has eigenvalues @xmath146 .",
    "let @xmath147 and consider the ueda s ( @xcite,@xcite ) type of free product coaction on @xmath148 , that acts trivially on @xmath27 and by conjugation on @xmath149 .",
    "let @xmath150 be the popa s type factor constructed in lemma [ lemde.4 ] .",
    "then @xmath151 if @xmath58 is the function algebra of @xmath152 , and @xmath153 is the fundamental representation then we have equality",
    ".    let @xmath154 be a matrix unit for @xmath149 that diagonalizes @xmath145 .",
    "assume that the unitary implementing the representation is represented as @xmath155 note that we use a another indexing for the entries of the unitary than the one used in @xcite , section 4 .",
    "since as proved in @xcite , @xmath156 is the unitary corresponding to the conjugate representation it follows that the matrix @xmath157 is a unitary too .",
    "thus we have the following unitarity conditions : @xmath158    @xmath159    the corepresentation for the algebra @xmath149 obtained by conjugation by the unitary @xmath160 is given by @xmath161 the elements in the algebra @xmath150 have an open and closing parenthesis structure ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "this proves that these elements are fixed points under the coaction , by recursively using ( first equality in each of ) the relations [ eqde.4 ] , [ eqde.5 ] .",
    "for example the coaction on an element of the form @xmath162 gives @xmath163 by applying first equation [ eqde.4 ] and then [ eqde.5 ] it follows that @xmath164 this proves that the coaction on @xmath165 in ( [ eqde.8 ] ) gives @xmath166 .",
    "the only other fixed point are obtained by recurrence .",
    "note that the algebra @xmath27 is in the fixed point algebra of the coaction .",
    "more precisely if @xmath165 in the fixed point algebra and @xmath167 is haar measure , we need to show that @xmath168 this follows by using the modular properties of the haar measure and using the relations [ eqde.8 ] .",
    "once we have shown this and since @xmath27 is obviously in the fixed point algebra the result follows from the definition of the algebra @xmath6 as the minimal algebra containing @xmath27 closed to the operation in the statement of lemma [ lemde.4 ] .",
    "let @xmath169 be the subspace of @xmath27 consisting of elements of zero trace .",
    "the fixed point algebra and popa s algebra admit a filtration given by the subspaces@xmath170 corresponding to the number of occurrences of copies of @xmath149 . moreover",
    "the averaging argument ( with respect to haar measure ) used in @xcite or @xcite to establish that the fixed point algebra in the powers factor is the algebra generated by the jones projections , allows to reduce the determination of the the fixed point algebra , to the determination of the intersection of the fixed point algebra with the subspaces in the filtration .",
    "therefore , to show the equality , when @xmath11 is @xmath152 , of the algebra in popa s construction with the fixed point algebra , it is therefore sufficient to check that the intersections of these two algebras with the space @xmath171 coincide .",
    "( this comes also to to the determine the fixed point algebra in spaces of the form @xmath172 , by formally replacing elements in @xmath169 with tensor product sign .",
    "counting dimensions of fixed point algebra could probably give an alternative for the argument bellow ) .",
    "since we allready have shown the reverse equality , it is sufficient to check that any element in the fixed point algebra intersected with one of the above finite dimensional spaces @xmath170 is one of the elemnts that respects the open and closing paranthesis structure of the reccursive construction of the popa s algebra .",
    "so assume that for given scalars @xmath173 we have an fixed point element of the form @xmath174 @xmath175 then the fixed point condition comes to the following condition that has to hold for all @xmath176 :    @xmath177    by denoting @xmath178 the matrix @xmath179 , and by @xmath160 the matrix @xmath180 and by @xmath181 the matrix @xmath182 , the relation [ simplificarea ] comes to the following equation : @xmath183    let @xmath184 and @xmath185 be the matrices defined by @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "then the equations [ eqde.4 ] , [ eqde.5 ] correspond to @xmath188 @xmath189 where @xmath190 and @xmath191 are considered as the matrices indexed as follows : @xmath192 and @xmath193 . as in @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "the relations [ trans1],[trans2 ] are the only relations defining @xmath194 thus if a matrix @xmath178 verifies the relation [ simplif ] , then @xmath178 is obtained by reccurence ( and linear span ) from consecutive applications of the relations [ trans1 ] , [ trans2 ] .    to have a reduction we therefore have to use the relation @xmath195 , or @xmath196 ( the other two equtions in [ eqde.4 ] , [ eqde.5 ] involve a summation index which is not appropriate for the corresponding sum ) .",
    "this means that the only possibility to have a simplification in [ simplificarea ] , by using the defining relations of @xmath152 , is if somewhere in the sum of [ simplificarea ] , we have that @xmath197 splits as a sum of elements the form @xmath198 or in the form @xmath199 the symbol @xmath200 corresponding to omission of the corresponding symbol .",
    "moreover after applying such a simplification as in [ red1 ] and respectively [ red2 ] in [ desimplificat ] we obtain a sum in @xmath201 involving a corresponding @xmath202 or respectively @xmath203 .",
    "repeated application of the above two procedures outlined in the equations [ red1 ] , [ red2 ] to the sum in [ desimplificat ] , will give , once we have finished the simplification procedure to the sum reducing [ simplificarea ] to scalars , it follows that the fixed point element has exactly the open and closing paranthesis structure in the indices @xmath204 that corresponds to an element in the algebra derived from popa s construction .",
    "we can also use the the model described in the paper @xcite , where the structure of the free product algebra @xmath205 is described in terms of the `` infinite '' free semicircular element in @xcite ( here @xmath206 is endowed with a state ) .",
