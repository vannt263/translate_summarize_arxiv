    "general relativistic ( gr ) accretion flows dive supersonically onto astrophysical black holes ( bh ) in order to satisfy the inner boundary condition imposed by the event horizon . hence such accretion flows must be globally transonic ( e.g. , fukue 1987 ; chakrabarti 1989 ) .",
    "this extremely hot , high density , ultra - fast flow can provide key features of the spectra of some galactic and extragalactic bh candidates .",
    "it is believed that most of the supermassive bhs powering active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and stellar mass bhs in galactic microquasars possess non - zero values of the bh spin parameter , @xmath0 , which might play a crucial role in determining their spectra and jet production ( e.g. , rees 1984 ; frank , king & raine 1992 ; kato , fukue & mineshige 1998 ) .",
    "hence it is very important to study the dynamical as well as the thermodynamic properties of gr transonic bh accretion very close to the event horizon and to investigate how bh spin modulates such behavior .",
    "study of the multi - transonic behavior of bh accretion was initiated by abramowicz & zurek ( 1981 ) . here",
    "we formulate and solve the conservation equations governing gr , multi - transonic , advective accretion in the kerr metric to calculate the flow behavior extremely close ( @xmath1 0.01 gravitational radii ) to the bh event horizon as a function of the kerr parameter , @xmath0 .",
    "such a solution scheme for accretion onto a non - rotating bh has been outlined in das ( 2004 ) .",
    "we concentrate on accretion with sub - keplerian angular momentum distributions .",
    "such weakly rotating flows are exhibited in various physical situations , such as detached binary systems fed by accretion from ob stellar winds ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ; liang & nolan 1984 ) , semi - detached low - mass non - magnetic binaries ( bisikalo et al .",
    "1998 ) , and super - massive bhs fed by accretion from slowly rotating central stellar clusters ( illarionov 1988 ; ho 1999 and references therein ) . even for a standard keplerian accretion disk",
    ", turbulence may produce such low angular momentum flow ( e.g. , igumenshchev & abramowicz 1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "we find that our formalism is also valid for accretion with substantial angular momentum ( as large as keplerian ) for retrograde flows .",
    "we consider non - self - gravitating , non - magnetized accretion .",
    "the gravitational radius is @xmath2 and we employ units where @xmath3 . we use boyer  lindquist coordinates with signature @xmath4 , and an azimuthally lorentz boosted orthonormal tetrad basis co - rotating with the accreting fluid .",
    "we define @xmath5 to be the specific angular momentum of the flow and neglect any gravo - magneto - viscous non - alignment between @xmath5 and @xmath0 .",
    "we focus on the stationary axisymmetric solution of the following equations :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the energy momentum tensor , the four velocity and the rest mass density of the accreting fluid , respectively , and the semicolon denotes the covariant derivative",
    ". the radial momentum balance condition may be obtained from @xmath9 .",
    "exact solutions of these conservation equations require knowledge of the accretion geometry and the introduction of a suitable equation of state .",
    "we concentrate on polytropic accretion for which @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the monotonic and continuous functions of the specific entropy density , and the constant adiabatic index of the flow , respectively . the specific proper flow enthalpy is taken to be @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the polytropic sound speed defined as @xmath15 ; here @xmath16 is the local flow temperature , @xmath17 is the mass - energy density , and @xmath18 are known functions .",
    "the subscript @xmath19 indicates that the derivative is taken at constant specific entropy .",
    "hence , @xmath20 , where @xmath21^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath22 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath23 is the mass of the hydrogen atom , and @xmath24 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "we assume that the disk has a radius dependent local half - thickness , @xmath25 , and its central plane coincides with the equatorial plane of the bh .",
    "we use the vertically integrated model ( matsumoto et al .  1984 ) in describing black hole accretion disks where the equations of motion apply to the equatorial plane of the bh , assuming the flow to be in hydrostatic equilibrium in the transverse direction .",
    "various dissipative processes are not explicitly taken into account .",
    "even thirty years after the discovery of standard accretion disk theory ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , modeling of viscous multi - transonic bh accretion , including proper heating and cooling mechanisms , is still quite an arduous task , even for newtonian flows .",
    "the extremely large radial velocity close to the bh implies @xmath26 , with @xmath27 the infall ( viscous ) timescales ; hence our assumption of inviscid flow is not unjustified , at least out to a few or to perhaps tens of @xmath28 .",
    "one of the most significant effects of the introduction of viscosity would be the reduction of radial angular momentum .",
    "hence study of the behavior of flow variables as functions of @xmath5 provides some insight about the flow behavior for viscous transonic accretion .",
    "the temporal component of the first part of eq .",
    "( 1 ) leads to the conservation of specific flow energy @xmath29 along each streamline as , @xmath30 ( anderson 1989 ) .",
    "the kerr metric in the equatorial plane of the black hole may be written as ( e.g. , novikov & thorne 1973 )    @xmath31    where @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "the angular velocity @xmath34 is    @xmath35    the normalization relation @xmath36 , along with the above value of @xmath34 , gives us the expression @xmath37^\\frac{1}{2},\\ ] ]    where @xmath38 is the radial three velocity in the co - rotating fluid frame .",
    "hence we obtain the conserved specific energy ( which includes the rest mass energy ) to be @xmath39^{-1 } v_t.$ ] note that our final calculations will provide the value of @xmath38 and its related quantities rather than those of @xmath40 . hereafter",
    ", it is implied that any appearance of @xmath40 in any mathematical expression is transformed in terms of @xmath38 using eq .",
    "we follow abramowicz , lanza & percival ( 1997 ) to derive the expression for disk height @xmath25 in our flow geometry because the corresponding equations in their calculations remain non - singular on the horizon and can accommodate a thin disk geometry as well as quasi - spherical flow .",

    "it is worth noting that the idea of shock formation in bh accretion is contested by some authors ( see narayan et al .",
    "1998 and references therein for a review ) .",

    ", solutions through @xmath74 do not have _ independent _ physical existence , and can only be accessed if the supersonic flow through @xmath73 undergoes a shock , so that it generates extra entropy , becomes subsonic , and produces the physical segment of the solution through @xmath74 .",
    "if a shock forms , the calculation of @xmath98 for shocked flows boils down to the calculation of @xmath98 for flow through @xmath74 .",
    "we find that for flows through @xmath74 , the general profiles for the variations of @xmath98 with @xmath0 remain exactly the same as that for flow through @xmath73 ; only the magnitudes of various @xmath98 change .",
    "we obtain @xmath107 and @xmath108(r_i ) > \\left[t_\\delta,\\rho_\\delta , p_\\delta\\right](r_o)$ ] , because the shock compresses the flow and makes it hotter .",
    "2 is drawn for @xmath109 , but a similar figure could be drawn for any value of @xmath12 allowing multi - transonic accretion .",
    "we find that for both prograde and retrograde flows , @xmath108 $ ] non - linearly and monotonically correlate with @xmath12 while @xmath110 anti - correlates with @xmath12 .",
    "multi - transonic accretion does not exist for the same @xmath93}$ ] for all values of @xmath0 for prograde flows .",
    "each curve segment in fig .",
    "2 shows the range of @xmath0 for which a set of @xmath111 overlaps to produce three sonic points .",
    "specifically , @xmath29 is constant in fig",
    ".  2 and each curve corresponds to a value of @xmath5 which allows multi - transonicity for that range of @xmath0 . the allowed overlap range in @xmath0 decreases as @xmath0 increases .    for retrograde flows",
    ", the situation is different . for many combinations of @xmath93}$ ] ,",
    "one obtains a large range of @xmath0 ( sometimes even covering the _ complete _ range of bh spin ) for which one can have a _ fixed _ value of @xmath112 producing multi - transonicity .",
    "hence the variations of @xmath98 s with @xmath0 produce continuous curves covering almost the whole range @xmath113 . _",
    "therefore multi - transonicity is more common for counter - rotating bh accretion .",
    "_ we also found that , unlike prograde flows , retrograde flows with values of angular momentum even as high as keplerian can demonstrate multi - transonic behavior .    from fig .  2 we see that the the correlations ( of temperature , density and pressure ) and the anti - correlation ( of mach number ) , with bh spin are non - linear but monotonic .",
    "hence , rapidly rotating bhs will produce a hotter and denser _ prograde _ flow near the horizon .",
    "however , we again found that this is not true for counter - rotating flows , where the above - mentioned variations are not monotonic ; rather they show distinct points of inflection at some intermediate value of @xmath0 .",
    "the physical reason for such a behavior for retrograde flows is not clear to us . if one keeps @xmath114 fixed but decreases @xmath5 ( which effectively mimics the introduction of viscosity to the system ) , @xmath108 $ ] non - linearly decreases and @xmath110 increases for prograde flow , whereas the trends are just the opposite for retrograde flow .",
    "these trends indicate how our results would be modified if our formalism were to be applied to study viscous transonic flow .",
    "hence the study of @xmath98 as a function of @xmath0 also opens up the possibility of distinguishing between the prograde and retrograde flows if the transonic properties of such flows can be measured .",
    "our formalism clearly allows the study of the dependence of the behavior of multi - transonic accretion on bh spin at any accretion length scale ( including the radial shock location ) .",
    "thus our work is important for understanding how bh spin influences several accretion related astrophysical phenomena , as only multi - transonic flows can produce shock waves in bh accretion disks ( das 2002 ; das , pendharkar & mitra 2003 , and references therein ) . such hot and dense post - shock flow is important for understanding astrophysical phenomena such as spectral properties of bh candidates ( chakrabarti & titarchuk 1995 , and references therein ) , the formation and dynamics of accretion powered cosmic jets ( das & chakrabarti 1999 , and references therein ; das , rao & vadawale 2003 ) , and the origin of qpos in galactic sources ( das 2003 , and references therein ) .",
    "once we compute the exact shock location and related post - shock quantities ( barai , das & wiita , in preparation ) for flow geometries presented in this letter , it becomes straightforward to show how @xmath0 determines the exact macrophysics of the post - shock flow right at the shock location , which in turn , may help determine how the properties of galactic and extragalactic jets and qpos depend on the rotation of the bh .",
    "one of the most tantalizing issues in relativistic astrophysics is to discover whether the spin of a bh can be determined from observations . by far",
    "the most discussed and accepted approach to this problem is through the study of the skewed shapes of fluorescent iron lines ( see reynolds & nowak 2003 for a review ) .",
    "our work provides an independent approach to this key question for hot , low angular momentum , prograde accretion flows , as well as for retrograde flows with substantial angular momentum .",
