    "bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) with attractive two - body interaction are dynamically unstable in a trap if the number of condensed atoms reaches a critical value @xcite .",
    "generally , hefty becs will collapse following a switch of the s - wave scattering length from a positive value ( or zero ) to a negative one via the use of a feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "however it was found that in such case the number of remnant condensate atoms can be above the critical number @xcite .",
    "this was explained by the generation of bright solitary waves with repulsive interactions @xcite .",
    "these repulsive interactions have been used to indirectly infer a repulsive relative phase @xmath0 @xcite between neighbor solitons @xcite .",
    "origin of such phases could be quantum mechanical phase fluctuations of the bosonic field operators @xcite due to the nonlinear modulation instability .    on the other hand , quantum and thermal excitations , which can not be taken into account by simple mean - field theory , play a crucial role in the collapse of becs @xcite .",
    "these effects have been studied by effective quantum field method @xcite .",
    "an interesting result arising from these studies is the absence of @xmath1-phase relation as revealed recently by @xcite .",
    "briefly , a relative phase of @xmath1 is introduced in mean - field theory between neighbor bright solitons @xcite .",
    "usually one expects a @xmath1 relative phase to support repulsive interaction between solitons . however , there are indications that the repulsive interaction can come from quantum ( thermal ) noise rather than the repulsive phase @xcite . in addition one",
    "also doesnot get a fixed @xmath1-phase relation within mean - field theory if becs is developed from a nonuniform initial state @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to ask what a meaningful phase would entail .",
    "a solid starting point would be mean field theory , in which @xmath1-phase is assumed @xcite .",
    "collisional dynamics of bright solitons in attractive becs confined in a trap is usually based on it @xcite . yet",
    "other phase relation is argued in @xcite as well .",
    "consequently ascertaining the phase becomes important .",
    "in this paper , we propose a method to measure the relative phase directly rather than to infer it indirectly from soliton interactions . in the experiment @xcite , two bright solitary waves are separated in coordinate space .",
    "this makes it hard to measure the phase by overlapping the density @xcite",
    ". however interference appears if the wave function is transformed into momentum space @xcite .",
    "this indicates that we can extract the relative phase from the dynamic structure factor .",
    "the dynamic structure factor provides important information about the spectrum of collective excitations and momentum distribution @xcite . stimulated",
    "two - photon bragg scattering has been used to measure the dynamic structure factor at high momentum transfer and provided high resolution and sensitivity @xcite .",
    "measuring phase in momentum space is proposed by pitaevskii et al .",
    "@xcite , who suggest to measure the coherence of two spatially separated becs confined in a double - well potential in this way .",
    "this method can be applied for the problems we consider here as our two bright solitons are well separated in the trap @xcite .",
    "we calculate the dynamic structure factors for two solitons with @xmath1-phase and in - phase ( @xmath2 ) using the impulse approximation @xcite .",
    "our results show that the dynamic structure factors have distinguishable peaks corresponding to these phase relations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we show that the momentum density exhibits interference due to the relative phase between two bright solitary waves in a trapped bec . the phase carried by solitary waves",
    "is successfully recovered by a maximal response of the dynamic structure factor .",
    "only when @xmath2 appears a single peak , which represents a large occupation of scattered atoms with the same energy as the photon .",
    "in contrast , two peaks would be the sign of @xmath3 . in sec.iii ,",
    "the dynamic structure factor is discussed for a case when two solitary waves move symmetrically in a trap with a small velocity .",
    "this is the general case as they are trapped in a harmonic potential and interact repulsively .",
    "although the shapes of the dynamic structure factor are modified by the nonzero velocity , they provide distinguishable information of the concrete values of the phase also in this case . in sec.iv",
    ", we conclude the paper .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) is very effective in providing both qualitative and quantitative predictions for static and dynamical properties of an attractive bec @xcite .",
    "we consider n weakly interacting bosons trapped in a quasi - one - dimensional potential @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the transverse and the longitudinal trap frequencies accordingly .",
    "the dynamics of the condensate is governed by the gpe @xmath7\\psi \\label{3dgp}\\ ] ] here @xmath8 is the effective coupling constant representing two - body interaction strength . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are s - wave scattering length and mass of atoms . the wave function of the condensate is normalized as @xmath11 .    the gpe is widely accepted for studying dynamics of interacting becs at temperature @xmath12 .",
    "explicit analytical solutions are only available in a few situations . for instance , bright soliton solutions can be derived in free space using the inverse - scattering method @xcite . vortex solutions in rotating becs are also available for analytical treatment @xcite .",
    "it is hard to obtain the exact soliton solution in the presence of harmonic trap . in this paper",
    ", we consider the soliton solution of a bec with a gaussian form as it is confined in a harmonic trap .",
    "the wave function of a bec confined in an elongated axially symmetric harmonic trap is given by @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the width of condensate in the @xmath15-direction and @xmath16 are the harmonic lengths correspondingly .",
    "note that the gaussian wave function is close to the exact soliton solution when @xmath17 is comparable with @xmath18 @xcite . with this gaussian ansatz",
    ", the energy of each atom is obtained readily from the gpe @xmath19 here we have used @xmath20 and @xmath21 denoting the zero - point energy in a harmonic trap and two - body interaction energy .    a homogeneous condensate with attractive interaction in free space is unstable while the zero - point kinetic energy can prevent the collapse of a trapped condensate with the finite number of particles @xcite .",
    "@xmath22 where @xmath23 is a constant of order @xmath24 and @xmath25{a_xa_ya_z}$ ] is the mean harmonic length .",
    "it implies that on one hand , at given trap frequencies and s - wave scattering length , a condensate containing a finite number of particles is stabilized by the balance of kinetic energy and negative interaction energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the interaction energy is limited by a small value too .",
    "this will turn out to be helpful in calculating the dynamic structure factor .    in the presence of two bright solitary waves ,",
    "the wave function is taken as @xmath26 with relative phase @xmath27 . because of repulsive interactions between two solitary waves , they will be spatially separated in a harmonic trap @xcite .",
    "this makes it difficult to measure the phase in coordinate space , where overlapping density profiles could induce a fringe pattern @xcite .",
    "this obstacle can be overcome if we transform the wave function into momentum space , where two spatially separated condensates will exhibit interference @xcite . and the momentum distribution can be measured by stimulated two - photon bragg scattering @xcite giving the dynamic structure factor of the system . at large momentum transfer @xmath28 , we can use the impulse approximation to calculate the dynamic structure factor @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath28 and @xmath30 are momentum and energy transfered from the laser pulse to the condensate and @xmath31 is the momentum density of the bec @xmath32 where @xmath33 is momentum distribution obtained by fourier transformation of wave function @xmath34 @xmath35 in order to obtain the dynamic structure factor , at first we need to know the momentum density distribution .",

    "the period of the interference pattern is @xmath52 .",
    "obviously momentum density distribution depends on the phase @xmath27 .",
    "for example , @xmath53 at @xmath54 but has a maximum at @xmath55 .",
    "this implies that the relative phase @xmath27 displaces the momentum interference . in the following , we study the dynamic structure factor of the system by applying bragg spectroscopy @xcite . here",
    "interaction effects on the relative shift of the peak are negligible ( eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) ) .",
    "weak interaction is particular useful because it makes using of impulse approximation feasible at high momentum transfer @xcite .    by applying a bragg pulse in the @xmath36-direction",
    ", we obtain the dynamic structure factor from eq .",

    "the period of cosine function is @xmath61    at a given distance @xmath38 and optical momentum @xmath62 , the relative phase @xmath27 will shift the interference pattern of the dynamic structure factor .",
    "consequently , we can measure the relative phase from the fringe of the dynamic structure factor .",
    "in the experiment @xcite , the maximal distance of two solitons is about @xmath63 and the width of each soliton is about @xmath64 .",
    "since the size @xmath17 of an attractive condensate is small , the wave length of the laser field must be far smaller than @xmath17 .",
    "here we assume the momentum of the laser field is @xmath65 . in fig .",
    "( [ fringegaussian ] ) we show the dynamic structure factor for two different phase relations @xmath46 .",
    "when @xmath2 , @xmath66 is close to that of a single condensate @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the maximum located at @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) for @xmath2 , @xmath66 for @xmath3 it is zero there due to the interference .",
    "but two peaks emerge symmetrically around energy @xmath67 .",
    "these results show that the dynamic structure factor exhibits contrasting interferences for @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "as we introduced previously , the relative phase plays a crucial role in collapsed condensates @xcite . in a bose gas with attractive two - body interaction , only a finite number of atoms can be condensed @xcite .",
    "this is true for a single condensate . however , in a fragmented condensate , for example , several bright solitary waves interacting repulsively support a bigger system . in this case , the repulsive interaction among neighboring peaks comes from the special relative phase @xmath69 according to mean field theory @xcite . on the other hand , when including quantum noise , truncated wigner quantum field simulations give @xmath2 rather than @xmath3 @xcite . since the experiments did not directly monitor the phase , a measurement proposal based on the dynamic structure factor",
    "is established to distinguish the relative phase .",
    "we also study the dynamic structure factor if @xmath27 is slightly deviating from @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "the deviation is @xmath70 around them . for two bright solitons ,",
    "a relative phase in the entire range @xmath0 can stabilize the system .",
    "such a phase deviation could be possible in the experiment .",
    "consequently , we d like to see how a slight phase deviation affects momentum interference and whether or not we could distinguish the phase .",
    "the results are reported in fig .",
    "( [ fringeerror ] ) .",
    "the dynamic structure factor remains similar except a slight displacement of the peak position . for phase shifts around @xmath2",
    ", it only moves the maximum along the energy axis .",
    "the dynamic structure factors are not symmetric about @xmath71 any more for phase shift about @xmath3 .",
    "a maximum appears in the lower energy part for a shift @xmath72 while other smaller peaks appear in the high energy part .",
    "vice versa for @xmath73 . despite these shifts ,",

    "thus far we considered the situation when the two solitary waves have zero velocity and are well separated .",
    "however , the observed solitary waves move in the trap and the velocity can not be always zero .",
    "actually , the above results assume that the two solitary waves are separated by the maximal or minimal distance . in experiment @xcite ,",
    "two solitons move symmetrically about the trap center .",
    "the frequencies of the oscillation depend on the external harmonic trap frequencies . in this section",
