    "one of the methods to measure the parameters of the global cosmological metric of the universe is to observe the angular size and the redshift extent of a set of objects , which can be assumed to be spherically symmetric and to follow the hubble expansion on average ( alcock & paczyski 1979 ) .",
    "more generally , this geometric factor can be measured from a correlation function of any set of objects depending on angular separation and redshift difference , by requiring that the correlation is isotropic .",
    "it has long been known that this measurement at high redshift is sensitive primarily to the cosmological constant ( alcock & paczyski 1979 ) .",
    "however , generally the correlation of objects is due to gravitational collapse , and the peculiar velocities make the correlation function in redshift space anisotropic ( kaiser 1987 ) .",
    "the effect of peculiar velocities must be taken into account before the method can be applied .",
    "recently , a method has been developed to recover the power spectrum of mass fluctuations from quasar absorption spectra , by measuring the one - dimensional power spectrum and converting it to the desired three - dimensional power spectrum ( croft et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter cwkh ) .",
    "this method suffers from peculiar velocity distortions similar to those which distort the isotropy of the correlation in redshift space . here",
    ", we consider the accuracy in the measurement of the redshift space correlation function from the ly@xmath0 forest in nearby pairs of quasars .",
    "we show that it is possible to disentangle the effects of geometry and peculiar velocities , and recover the power spectrum of mass fluctuations from the correlations in the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "we also demonstrate that the peculiar velocities are important for correctly deriving the shape of the power spectrum .    in  2",
    "we summarize equations describing the cosmological geometry , discuss the linear theory correlation function in redshift space , and comment on the effect of peculiar velocities on the shape of the power spectrum . in ",
    "3 we use a random line model to estimate the error in the measurement of @xmath5 from a given number of observed quasar spectra . the discussion is given in  4 .",
    "figures [ fitplot]-[fitplot4 ] contain the main results of this paper .",
    "the following is a short summary of the cosmological equations we shall use ( these have been discussed earlier in several papers , e.g. , matsubara & suto 1996 , ballinger et al .",
    "observations directly measure the redshift and angular position of each object .",
    "we write the angular and redshift separation between two objects as ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) .",
    "the redshift is caused both by hubble flow velocities ( @xmath15 ) and peculiar velocities along the line of sight ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the total velocity separation along the line of sight is @xmath17 .",
    "it is also convenient to define a perpendicular velocity separation , @xmath18 , where @xmath5 is a dimensionless function of redshift that includes all the dependence on the global cosmological metric . with the assumption of isotropy",
    ", the real space two - point correlation function of density fluctuations @xmath19 must be a function of @xmath20 only .",
    "if @xmath21 could be measured , it would be a relatively straightforward matter to measure @xmath5 by simply demanding isotropy .",
    "in reality , distances can not be measured accurately and only the redshift space correlation function @xmath22 can be determined , which is affected by peculiar velocities .",
    "the peculiar velocities introduce an anisotropy in @xmath22 of the same order as the difference in @xmath5 between various cosmological models .    the quantity @xmath5 is predicted for any cosmological model .",
    "if the present density of matter ( in units of the critical density ) is @xmath23 , and considering also a negative pressure component with density @xmath24 and equation of state @xmath25 ( the case @xmath26 is the cosmological constant ) , we have , for an open universe , @xmath27 }         { ( 1+z)\\sqrt{\\omega_r } } ~,\\ ] ] and for a flat universe , @xmath28 here , @xmath29 ( @xmath30 for a flat universe ) , and @xmath31    = 4.7truein    figure [ ffig ] shows predictions for @xmath5 .      in linear theory , the redshift space correlation function of the density field is given by ( kaiser 1987 ; lilje & efstathiou 1989 ; hamilton 1992 ; fisher 1995 ) @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 are the usual legendre polynomials , and @xmath36 ~. \\label{xil}\\ ] ] the functions @xmath37 are the usual spherical bessel functions , and @xmath38 is the power spectrum of the mass fluctuations .",
    "the parameter @xmath39 is related to the linear theory bias @xmath12 by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the linear growth factor , @xmath2 is the hubble constant and @xmath42 is the age of the universe [ see peebles 1993 ; @xmath43 is a good approximation in most models ] .    equation ( [ corfunc ] ) is valid only in linear theory , and the correlation function @xmath22 could only be determined directly from observations if the linear density field , @xmath44 , were known .",
    "only the fraction of the flux that is transmitted , @xmath45 , can be determined along a line of sight from the ly@xmath0 forest spectrum in a quasar ( we assume here that the quasar continuum has been fitted to a model , allowing the transmitted flux fraction @xmath45 to be measured at every pixel ) .",
    "we need a way to recover the linear density field @xmath44 from the observed @xmath45 . in general , this can not be done exactly since @xmath45 is only known along a line of sight , and besides the chaotic nature of non - linear evolution limits the accuracy to which @xmath44 can be recovered . here",
    ", we adopt the gaussianization procedure of cwkh ( see also weinberg 1992 ) .",
    "gaussianization assumes that the initial mass density fluctuations were gaussian random and that evolution approximately preserves the rank order of densities , even as it distorts the distribution from a gaussian . in the case of the ly@xmath0 forest ,",
    "values of the observed flux decrement are mapped monotonically onto a new variable @xmath44 required to have the probability distribution function @xmath46 ~.        \\label{pdf}\\ ] ] of course , the fluctuation amplitude @xmath47 is not recovered by the assumption that the rank order is preserved .",
    "computing the correlation function of the gaussianized spectrum yields only the ratio @xmath48 .",
    "once the new variable @xmath44 is obtained , the correlation function may be computed from observations through the usual estimator given by its definition : @xmath49 , where @xmath50 symbolizes the vector separation @xmath51 .",
    "the average is taken over all pairs of pixels separated by @xmath50 in the spectra available . however , this is not necessarily the best estimator of @xmath22 , and in general it should be better to examine the full 2-point joint probability distribution function .",
    "one of the main reasons for this is that the assumption that the density rank order is preserved should obviously break down at high optical depths , because the gas at high densities will typically be shocked and follow a highly stochastic evolution , developing small - scale structure .",
    "the spectrum will also be greatly affected by velocity caustics and thermal broadening , and when @xmath52 the value of @xmath44 derived from gaussianization will have large errors because of saturation . on the other hand , at low densities",
    "the evolution is much more regular , velocity caustics do not appear , and thermal broadening can be neglected , so there should be a good correspondence between the optical depth at a given velocity and the gas density at the corresponding point in space .",
    "the 2-point distribution function for a gaussian field is @xmath53 \\ , .",

    "\\label{tpf2}\\ ] ] thus , for every value of @xmath55 , we can estimate @xmath56 from the distribution of @xmath57 conditional to the value of @xmath55 .",
    "for example , one could estimate @xmath56 from the median of @xmath57 ( or any other adequate percentile ) , and see how the result depends on @xmath55",
    ". if the method works , @xmath58 should be approximately independent of @xmath55 for low values of @xmath55 .",
    "using instead @xmath49 is equivalent to averaging the estimate of @xmath22 over all values of @xmath55 with equal weights .      in their reconstruction of the linear power spectrum from ly@xmath0 forest lines ,",
    "cwkh neglect the effect of peculiar velocities on the shape of @xmath38 .",
    "this effect arises in the conversion from the measured one - dimensional power spectrum @xmath59 to the desired three - dimensional power spectrum @xmath60 .",
    "while the shape of @xmath60 is not affected by peculiar velocities in linear theory ( kaiser 1987 ) , @xmath59 _ is _ affected as shown by kaiser & peacock ( 1991 ) : @xmath61 to demonstrate how this will affect the reconstruction of cwkh , we substitute a specific @xmath62 into equation ( [ 1d3d ] ) , with various values of @xmath39 .",
    "we use the cold dark matter power spectrum parameterization of bardeen et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , with the coefficients of ma ( 1996 ) ( see  3.1 below ) , and the parameters : @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "we then assume that the resulting @xmath59 is the one - dimensional power spectrum for the ly@xmath0 forest and attempt to reconstruct the three - dimensional power spectrum ignoring peculiar velocities ( i.e. , setting @xmath66 ) .",

    "= 4.7truein    figure [ f1d3d ] shows the results of this procedure for various values of @xmath39 .",
    "the error in the reconstructed power spectrum grows with scale and eventually causes the results to become negative .",
    "the power spectrum used in this figure was smoothed by a gaussian with radius @xmath69 quoted in cwkh ( in the caption of their fig .",
    "2 ) was wrong by a factor @xmath70 ; croft 1998 , priv .",
    "communication . ] .",
    "cwkh found that this was necessary to match the @xmath38 they reconstructed from simulations .",
    "thus , the shape of the mass power spectrum @xmath62 can not be recovered until the parameter @xmath39 is known .",
    "how can this parameter be determined ?",
    "one could in principle attempt to determine @xmath39 from observations in multiple lines of sight , as described in the next section .",
    "the anisotropy of the correlation function depends on the two parameters @xmath39 and @xmath5 .",
    "but as we shall see , a very large amount of data will be required to measure both of them independently .",
    "if @xmath39 can be predicted from theory , it should be much less difficult to determine the power spectrum and @xmath5 .",
    "linear theory would predict @xmath71 for a constant temperature in the intergalactic medium , because the optical depth ( which is the quantity that is modified by peculiar velocities in the mapping from real to redshift space ) is proportional to the neutral hydrogen density , or the square of the gas density . in a photoionized medium",
    ", the gas temperature is determined by a balance of photoionization heating and adiabatic cooling .",
    "the heating rate is proportional to the recombination rate , @xmath72 , and the adiabatic cooling is proportional to the temperature @xmath73 . since @xmath74 , the relation @xmath75 is set up if the gas temperature is not affected by shocks or by reionization ( see hui & gnedin 1997 , croft et al .",
    "this leads to a neutral hydrogen density proportional to @xmath76 , and therefore a ly@xmath0 forest bias @xmath77 . since @xmath78 at @xmath79 for viable models , @xmath80",
    "however , in reality the bias depends on the relation of optical depth to the initial density on small scales , where non - linearities are important , and therefore the correct bias to use in equations ( 6 ) , ( 9 ) , and ( 10 ) , where linear theory is applied to large scales using the gaussianization approximation , could be substantially different .",
    "numerical simulations can be used to calculate a better value for the ly@xmath0 forest bias ( which will in general depend on redshift ) , but of course this will only be accurate if the simulations are modeling the structure of the ly@xmath0 forest correctly .",
    "the effects of peculiar velocities on the recovery of the mass power spectrum have independently been pointed out in a recent paper by hui ( 1998 ) , which appeared as this paper was being completed .",
    "in this section , an estimate is obtained of the statistical error in measuring the parameters of the correlation function , due to the random nature of the absorption lines that appear in the spectra .",
    "a simple model of absorption lines will be used to generate random spectra that reproduce the characteristics of the individual ly@xmath0 forest absorption lines without the large scale correlation .      as discussed in  2",
    ", two parameters describe the anisotropy of the correlation function : @xmath5 , reflecting the effect of the cosmological geometry , and @xmath81 , incorporating the peculiar velocity effects .",
    "we also parameterize the shape of the power spectrum to a fitting formula for cold dark matter models , @xmath82 ^ 2 }           { [ 1+\\alpha_2 q + ( \\alpha_3 q)^2+(\\alpha_4 q)^3 +        ( \\alpha_5 q)^4]^{\\frac{1}{2 } } } ,        \\label{pspec}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 .",
    "we have reexpressed the power spectrum in terms of @xmath84 .",
    "the free parameters of this model for the shape of the power spectrum are @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( given by @xmath87 ) .",
    "the formula is given by bardeen et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , but we modify the parameters to the fit for @xmath88 : @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 ( ma 1996 ) .",
    "in addition we include a smoothing parameter by multiplying the above formula by the factor @xmath94 , with @xmath95 at @xmath96 .",
    "this is motivated by the result of cwkh , who find that the ly@xmath0 forest has a power spectrum ( after gaussianization ) that can be well approximated by a smoothed version of the power spectrum of the mass .",
    "we fix @xmath97 ( rather than @xmath98 ) to the same value for all models , since the observations always yield separations in terms of velocity .    in figure [ pred1 ] , we display the computed @xmath99 along the line of sight ( @xmath100 ) , and at separations @xmath101 and @xmath102 , at mean redshift @xmath103 . because of the gaussianization",

    "a spectrum is generated by calculating the transmitted flux at discrete pixels from the list of randomly generated lines .",
    "we then make a transformation of the transmitted flux to a new variable @xmath44 , requiring that the probability distribution of @xmath44 is gaussian ( this is the gaussianization procedure ) .",
    "because the absorption lines are random , there should be no correlation at separations beyond the width of the individual components , so any correlation we measure at larger separations is due to noise .",

    "we consider first as an example the triplet of quasars of crotts & fang ( 1998 ) , which have a useful redshift range @xmath128 and separations @xmath101 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 .",
    "the error bars we have computed for @xmath58 are not necessarily gaussian , and certainly not independent , so we use a monte carlo technique .",
    "we introduce noise to the calculated correlation function of a model by adding the noise values of the correlation measured from spectra of randomly generated lines ( i.e. , we sum the curves in fig . 3 and 5 ) .",
    "we then fit the five parameters of the model , minimizing the @xmath131 of the correlation function in linear bins of @xmath132 , using the error bars found from the dispersion in the correlation obtained from the spectra of random lines .",
    "we repeat this procedure independently 25 times and fit each of the 25 simulated correlation functions separately",
    ". this should give the range of the fitted values we would expect to obtain from data with some fixed true parameter values .",
    "we do not use the correlation function at separations less than @xmath133 , approximately the scale of non - linearities . changing this restriction to @xmath134 results in a small improvement ( particularly , tighter correlation between @xmath135 and @xmath39 ) , but does not substantially change our conclusions .",
    "figure [ fitplot ] shows the results for the @xmath109 , @xmath108 model , fit to the triplet of quasars described above .",
    "= 4.7truein    to reduce the scatter , it is necessary to add more quasars .",
    "figure [ fitplot2 ] shows the improvement that can be expected by combining multiple pairs of quasars at different angular separations ( but still at the same redshift ) .",
    "six pairs with separations @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 , with useful redshift range @xmath142 , are combined .",
    "= 4.7truein    in figure [ fitplot3 ] , we use the same 6 angular separations but reduce the noise in the cross - correlation by a factor of two , and reduce the noise in the los correlation by a factor of six .",

    "the sets of quasars used are the 6 pairs of figure [ fitplot2 ] .",
    "= 4.7truein    finally , with fixed @xmath39 , we found that @xmath135 can be measured to @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) using the reduced noise ( 24 quasar pairs ) of figure [ fitplot3 ] .",
    "we have presented a method for analyzing the ly@xmath0 forest spectra along parallel lines of sight in order to extract the geometric parameter @xmath5 and the quantity determining the strength of peculiar velocity distortions @xmath147 .",
    "we have worked here in the context of the linear regime , where the correlation function is small and the peculiar velocities generally cause large - scale structures ( with positive or negative density fluctuations ) to be flattened along the line of sight . using the gaussianization technique of croft et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , one can measure the full redshift space correlation function and obtain @xmath39 and @xmath5 . using a model",
    "in which we distribute a realistic set of discrete lines randomly in space we have estimated the statistical errors expected for a measurement of the correlation function .",
    "we estimate that dozens of pairs of quasars are needed to reliably distinguish competing cosmological models .",
    "the parameter @xmath135 should probably be easier to measure going to smaller separations , in the non - linear regime .",
    "the amplitude of the correlation is then much larger , so many fewer pairs of quasars should be needed to measure the anisotropy of the correlation function to a fixed relative accuracy , required to constrain @xmath135 to interesting levels . for small separations , the effect of peculiar velocities should be opposite to that in the linear regime : the correlation function should be elongated along the line of sight .",
    "this is caused by the well - known `` fingers of god '' effect in galaxy redshift surveys ( where high density clusters appear as highly elongated filaments pointing toward us ) . in the ly@xmath0 forest ,",
    "the `` fingers of god '' effect is simply the contribution of the internal velocity dispersion ( either hydrodynamic or thermal ) of the absorbers to their width .",
    "the disadvantage of working in the non - linear regime is that the anisotropy of the correlation function can only be predicted with numerical simulations ; in addition , the 2-point joint probability function is no longer given by equation ( 9 ) , because the density field is no longer gaussian .",
    "therefore , we can only measure @xmath135 if we can be certain that numerical simulations are accurate enough .",
    "but a more important reason to measure the 2-point function in the non - linear regime is probably that it will provide a very powerful test of the results of numerical simulations , and the large - scale structure theories in which they are based . if the ly@xmath0",
    "forest arises from individual , high - density clouds , the fingers of god should be much more elongated and common than in the modern theories of gravitational instability from primordial fluctuations .",
    "essentially , the full redshift space 2-point function gives a more quantitative version of the measurement of transverse sizes of the absorbers from coincidences of lines ( crotts & fang 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "on the large scales , an alternative to finding a large number of pairs of bright quasars to measure the anisotropy of the linear correlation function to high accuracy could be to work with spectra of much fainter , but much more numerous sources .",
    "so far , observational studies of the ly@xmath0 forest have used bright quasars as sources because of the desired high resolution and signal - to - noise that is necessary to measure the properties of individual absorption lines .",
    "but the correlation function could in principle be obtained from spectra of much poorer quality , as long as a very large number of spectra are taken .",
    "recently , large numbers of galaxies are being identified at high redshift with the method of the lyman limit break technique ( steidel et al .",
    "spectra are now being taken routinely of galaxies in the redshift range @xmath148 to @xmath149 , which have a number density of @xmath150 one galaxy per square arc minute ( steidel et al .",
    "if the stellar continuum of the galaxies can be modeled , the ly@xmath0 forest spectra in these galaxies could provide a better way to measure the ly@xmath0 forest correlation on large scales ( in this case , gaussianization could not be used because the transmitted flux is measured only with very poor resolution , so numerical simulations would be necessary to predict the correlation function of the smoothed transmitted flux ) .",
    "these observations could also be used to study the cross - correlation of the ly@xmath0 forest with the lyman limit break galaxies .",
    "future work is needed along two paths : analysis of numerical simulations and observational data .",
    "cwkh showed that the gaussianization method works fairly well when applied to numerical simulations .",
    "direct application of the full method to recover the redshift space correlation function to numerical simulations should indicate the effect of non - linearities and give a more accurate estimate of the accuracy that can be achieved in the observational determinations .",
    "the effect of the finite size of the numerical simulations should now also be more easily understood , since the analytic method used in this paper predicts how the correlation should behave on the large scales .",
