    "spacetime singularity is unavoidable in general relativity@xcite , which means the breakdown of our standard theory of gravity in ultraviolet region . to establish the fundamental gravitational theory beyond general relativity is one of the most intriguing question of physics .",
    "one may expect that this difficulty can be resolved by considering the quantum effect of gravity . however , unfortunately , the perturbative quantization approach of general relativity losses the renormalizability unlike the other fundamental interactions .",
    "in other words , there appears infinite numbers of divergent feynman diagrams , and thus , the infinite counter terms are required to regularize the gravitational quantum effects .",
    "hence one way to quantize gravity is non - perturbative approach such as the loop quantum gravity@xcite or the dynamical triangulation@xcite .",
    "another way is to find a new renormalizable gravitational theory .",
    "string theory @xcite can be such a candidate , but it has not been completed .",
    "recently , hoava proposed a gravitational theory with lifshitz scaling@xcite , which is anisotropic scaling between space and time , i.e. , @xmath1 .",
    "this scaling defines a scaling dimension @xmath2=-z$ ] with @xmath3=-1 $ ] , which is restored to the ordinary mass dimension when @xmath4 .",
    "it is found that if we set @xmath5 to the number of the spatial dimension , the dimension of the gravitational constant becomes zero , which means the gravitational force acquires renormalizability at least at a power - counting level .",
    "this gravitational theory is called hoava - lifshitz ( hl ) theory whose action includes higher spatial curvature terms up to cubic order as counter terms of renormalization .",
    "although there is a need for further investigation to confirm whether hl theory is truly renormalizable or not@xcite , strong gravitational phenomena , such as cosmological singularity avoidance @xcite and the black hole solution@xcite have been studied by several authors .",
    "in particular , study regarding the spacetime structure is particularly intriguing frontier .",
    "since the spacetime in hl theory losses local lorentz symmetry due to lifshitz scaling , the causal structure is drastically changed .",
    "if there is lifshitz scaling with @xmath6 , the dispersion relation of the signal particle is modified as @xmath7 , and then the sound speed is given by @xmath8 . in consequence ,",
    "the sound speed almost diverges if the particle is in an extremely high energetic state .",
    "one may consider it is impossible to define the casual horizon due to such an instantaneously propagating particle .",
    "however it is not the case . in the context of the einstein - aether ( - ) theory @xcite which has some equivalence to the infrared limit of hl theory@xcite",
    ", there still exists a causal horizon for such an extreme energetic particle .",
    "although  - theory itself is a toy model as a lorentz violating gravitational theory , it is found that the hl theory is reduced to  - theory in infrared limit if the aether is restricted to be hypersurface orthogonal . in other words ,",
    "the aether @xmath9 is constrained to a gradient of some scalar field @xmath10 as @xmath11 .",
    "if we set @xmath10 to time variable @xmath12 , the hl action in adm formalism is restored .",
    "therefore @xmath10 is called a ",
    "khronon  . in this theory , the spacetime is expressed by a series of three dimensional spacelike hypersurface @xmath13 constant , denoted by @xmath14 . particles with infinite propagating sound speed travel along to @xmath14 .",
    "then , if there is a spacetime structure such that @xmath14 parallels to a timelike killing vector @xmath15 , namely @xmath16 , any particles can not escape from this surface at least in a spherically symmetric spacetime .",
    "therefore this surface is a static limit for such energetic particles and it is called universal horizon@xcite .",
    "the properties of the universal horizon have been so far investigated on the following subjects : a static and spherically symmetric exact solution in  - theory with the universal horizon@xcite , the existence of the universal horizon@xcite , a charged black hole solution @xcite , thermodynamical aspects@xcite , a ray trajectory in a black hole spacetime @xcite , and a formation via gravitational collapse@xcite .",
    "then , one might ask a question whether the universal horizon exist even if the lifshitz scaling terms such as higher spatial curvatures are present . in this paper",
    ", we shall consider the backreaction to the black hole solution in  - theory by the lifshitz scaling terms .",
    "in other words , we investigate the black hole solution and properties of the universal horizon with the lifshitz scaling terms , which is the ultraviolet modification of gravity . as a first step to clarify the effect of gravitational lifshitz scaling",
    ", we shall consider only the @xmath0 scaling terms .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  [ action_equation ] , the action we considered is shown .",
    "we include the @xmath0 lifshitz scaling terms such as the quadratic spatial curvature to the action of  - theory with hypersurface orthogonal aether and give the basic equations .",
    "the propagating degree of freedoms in this theory , i.e. , the graviton and the scalar - graviton are also discussed . after giving the set up of our static , spherically symmetric system in  iii , we classify numerical solutions depending on the coupling constants of the lifshitz scaling terms in  [ num_sol ] .",
    "we then discuss the properties of a black hole solution and a thunderbolt singularity in  v. ",
    "[ sum_paper ] is devoted to conclusion of this paper .",
    "in order to see the behavior of the black hole solution with the backreaction from lifshitz scaling for @xmath6 , we shall consider non - projectable hl gravity theory . in @xcite ,",
    "its most general action is given as @xmath17 with @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are a lapse function , 3-metric , and an extrinsic curvature , respectively , and the potentials are defined by @xmath22 @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) are the coupling constants .",
    "the potential terms include not only the higher - order terms of the spatial curvatures @xmath27 , @xmath28 but also the non - linear terms of the gradient of a lapse function @xmath29 . @xmath30 and @xmath31 consist of 8 and 26 independent terms , respectively @xcite .",
    "the ir limit of non - projectable hl gravity theory is equivalent to the  - theory with a hypersurface orthogonality condition@xcite , from which a spacetime is foliated by three dimensional spacelike hypersurface @xmath14 .",
    "then the aether field @xmath32 is described by a gradient of a khronon field @xmath10 as @xmath33 since the lapse function @xmath19 in the hl gravity theory is related to this khronon field @xmath10 in the  - theory as @xmath34 $ ] , the aether field corresponds to the gradient of a lapse function @xmath35 in the low energy ir limit .",
    "hence we will study the  - theory with additional lifshitz scaling terms in order to discuss black hole solutions in the non - projectable hl gravity .",
    "although the singular behavior on the killing horizon can be avoided by adopting painleve - gullstrand coordinate , it must be singular at the universal horizon where the aether becomes normal to the timelike killing vector . on the universal horizon ,",
    "the khronon field @xmath10 diverges , in other words , there is no continuous time coordinate beyond this horizon in the ( 3 + 1)-decomposition .",
    "we then reformulate the theory in covariant manner rather than the adm ( 3 + 1)-decomposition .",
    "it is of great use to avoid coordinate singularities .    in this paper , as a first step , we shall restrict the ultraviolet modification terms only to simple scalar terms with @xmath0 scaling such as @xmath36 instead of considering all possible terms .",
    "the reason why only scalar terms are included is that those terms give the @xmath37 dependence in the dispersion relation of the scalar - graviton .",
    "then one expects that the property of the horizon for the scalar - graviton which is generally singular in  - theory will be drastically altered .",

    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in our numerical result , it is found that @xmath177 is extremely small , or possibly vanishes .",
    "moreover , it is notable that the values of @xmath178 seem to be universal for @xmath179 , namely , all asymptotic behaviors in large @xmath126 region , which is denoted by @xmath180 , are the same , but differs from that of the  - black hole .",
    "without lorentz symmetry , the killing horizon is no longer the event horizon in the static and spherically symmetric spacetime due to the presence of the superluminal propagating modes .",
    "however , in the context of the  - theory or infrared limit of the non - projectable hl gravity , a black hole solution can be still constructed by considering the universal horizon which is a static limit for an instantaneously propagating particle . in this paper , we have studied the backreaction to the black hole solution in  - theory by the lifshitz scaling terms .",
    "we have analyzed the ultraviolet modification of the  - black holes including the simple scalar terms with @xmath0 lifshitz scaling , specifically , the quadratic term of spacial curvature associated with the hypersurface orthogonal aether field ( @xmath36 ) , the quartic term of the aether acceleration ( @xmath170 ) , and the product of the spacial curvature and the quadratic term of the aether acceleration ( @xmath181 ) .    only for the case with @xmath170 term ( @xmath168 and @xmath172 ) , we have succeeded in finding a black hole solution with regular universal horizon , which is referred as @xmath182 .",
    "in contrast to the  - case , the black hole solutions are obtained without tuning the boundary parameter of the aether field @xmath120 . in other words ,",
    "@xmath182 solutions exist in a finite range in the @xmath183 parameter plane ( see fig . [ sol_a4_region ] ) .",
    "if we select the parameter @xmath120 beyond this range , a singular shell appears before forming a universal horizon . while , considering @xmath181 and/or @xmath36 terms ( @xmath184 and/or @xmath185 ) , any black hole solution with regular universal horizon can not be constructed due to the divergence of the basic equations on the universal horizon ( see appendix.[horizon_regularity ] ) .",
    "however , including only @xmath36 term with negative @xmath121 , we have found the solution with a thunderbolt singularity ( @xmath186 ) , whose universal horizon turns is still singular but the singularity is not observed any outside observers . although this solution can not be regarded as a black hole , the cosmic censorship hypothesis is not violated . since the thunderbolt singularity had been discovered in the context of the quantum gravity in lower dimension , the emergence of this solution is not so strange since the @xmath0 lifshitz scaling terms are regarded as quantum gravitational corrections .",
    "we then have studied several properties of our solutions including spacetime structures with their carter - penrose diagrams . to investigate the physical meaning of @xmath120",
    ", we have shown the effective energy momentum tensor of the aether field @xmath187}_{\\mu \\nu}$ ] , i.e. , the effective energy density and pressure . from these results",
    ", the parameter @xmath120 seems closely related to the distribution of the spherical aether cloud .",
    "namely , large value of @xmath120 configures a dense aether cloud and eventually induces a collapse of the aether field , which results in a formation of a `` timelike '' singular shell ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "moreover , we may speculate that regularity on the ( infrared limit of ) scalar graviton horizon is recovered due to the localization of the aether field near the horizon , which does not appeared in  - case .",
    "finally , we have explored the thermodynamical aspect of the @xmath182 solution .",
    "since the maximum universal horizon radius is obtained by choosing an appropriate value of @xmath120 for a given mass @xmath126 , the parameter @xmath120 may be fixed so that the area of the black hole , which may be regarded as the black hole entropy , becomes maximum .",
    "this solution may provide the most preferable black hole because it can be thermodynamical stable .",
    "additionally , the smarr s formula and the black hole temperature are also examined .",
    "when we speculate the mass - temperature relation as ( [ mod_smarr_rel ] ) , it is found that the temperature does not obey the inverse @xmath126 law at least for small @xmath126 unlike  - case .",
    "it increases exponentially as @xmath126 approaches to @xmath189 , for which the horizon area vanishes .",
    "although there are several coupling constants in the action we consider ( [ full_action ] ) , we have manipulated only ultraviolet coupling constants , i.e. , @xmath125 , @xmath122 and @xmath121 from @xmath0 lifshitz scaling terms .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 are all fixed so that the  - black hole is restored in infrared limit .",
    "however , we shall emphasize that the existence of the other types of black hole solution should not be excluded in this theory with the different values of the coupling constants @xmath193-@xmath194 .",
    "for example , non - black hole solution in  - theory ( a static and spherically symmetric solution with killing horizon but without a universal horizon found in @xcite ) may turn to form a causal boundary due to the lifshitz scaling terms .    turning our attention to more energetic region",
    ", it is obvious that the @xmath195 lifshitz scaling terms which are required by power - counting renormalizability of gravity turn to be dominant rather than @xmath0 terms .",
    "namely , our analysis in this paper should correspond to the intermediate region between the energy scale described in  - theory and the such a ultimately high energy scale .",
    "if we consider more ultraviolet modification terms in action , we may obtain the additional intriguing spacetime such as a singularity - free solution which is discovered in the context the early universe in hl theory .",

    "<S> we study a static , spherically symmetric and asymptotic flat spacetime , assuming the hypersurface orthogonal einstein - aether theory with an ultraviolet modification motivated by the hoava - lifshitz theory , which is composed of the @xmath0 lifshitz scaling terms such as scalar combinations of a three - ricci curvature and the acceleration of the aether field . </S>",
    "<S> for the case with the quartic term of the acceleration of the aether field , we obtain a two - parameter family of black hole solutions , which possess a regular universal horizon . </S>",
    "<S> while , if three - ricci curvature squared term is joined in ultraviolet modification , we find a solution with a thunderbolt singularity such that the universal horizon turns to be a spacelike singularity . </S>"
