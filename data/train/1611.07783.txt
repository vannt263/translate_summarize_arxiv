    "cubic nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equations model a great variety of phenomena in many fields of nonlinear science , including nonlinear optics , water waves , plasma physics , superconductivity , bose - einstein condensates  ( becs ) , and even financial dynamics  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a class of unstable but physically meaningful solutions of the cubic nls equation represents rogue waves ( rws ) , which spontaneously emerge due to the modulational instability ( mi ) of continuous - wave ( cw ) states and then disappear @xcite .",
    "recently , some new rw structures generated by the self - focusing nls equation and some of its extensions were found , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "most of these works studied continuous models , except for a few works which addressed the single - component ablowitz - ladik ( al ) equation @xcite and discrete hirota equation , using the modified bilinear method  @xcite and the generalized discrete darboux transformation  @xcite .",
    "being a fundamentally important mathematical model , the al equation does not find many physical realizations , but it can be implemented , in principle , as a model of arrayed optical waveguides @xcite , and as a mean - field limit of generalized bose - hubbard model for becs trapped in a deep optical - lattice potential kuba .",

    "system ( [ nls ] ) is an integrable system , which represents a special two - field reduction of the four - field al equation introduced and solved by means of the inverse - scattering transform in ref .",

    "a new generalized @xmath11-fold dt technique , generating higher - order rws , was developed for some _ continuous _ nonlinear wave equations  @xcite , but it is still an issue how to apply a similar technique to _ discrete _ nonlinear equations .",
