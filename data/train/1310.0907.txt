    "the plutinos are a set of kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) who reside in the 2:3 neptune mean motion resonance ( nmmr ) at semimajor axis @xmath10au .",
    "their dynamical properties are valuable clues as to what happened during the formation of the outer solar system , thus have received the most interest in the study of the kuiper belt ( malhotra et al .",

    "a generic feature of plutinos is that a substantial number of them have perihelia inside the orbit of neptune , while they are phase protected from close encounters with neptune , e.g. , the distance between pluto and neptune is never less than 18au ( cohen & hubbard 1965 ) . at the time of writing , more than 200 plutinos have been discovered , and their eccentricities and inclinations at epoch 2012 september 30 are shown in fig . [ observed ] . to well identify these plutinos , we take into account the kbos with 39au@xmath1140au registered in the iau minor planet center , and their orbits are integrated numerically by considering the gravitational effects of four jovian planets .",
    "then an object is regarded as plutino if its resonant angle librates throughout the 10 myr evolution .",
    "the mechanism of resonant capture envisioned by malhotra ( 1995 ) was first proposed to explain the concentration of kbos in the 2:3 nmmr . as neptune migrated radially outwards due to the exchange of energy and angular momentum between the jovian planets and planetesimals , its mean motion resonances swept through the residual disk and a lot of small bodies",
    "were captured .",
    ", plutinos with high inclinations are most concerned in this paper .",
    ", width=340 ]    yet , the planet migration and capture theory is not able to reproduce all the observed features of plutinos .",
    "the most difficult challenge is their high inclinations @xmath12 up to about @xmath13 ( fig .",
    "[ observed ] ) , or probably even larger values .",
    "several extremely inclined kbos have been reported , such as the scattered disk objects ) with perihelia beyond 30au , and they also have moderate to large inclinations . ]",

    "2005 ) and 2004 xr190 with @xmath15 ( allen et al .",
    "2006 ; gomes 2011 ) ; the centaurs 2002 xu93 with @xmath16 ( elliot et al .",

    "2009 ) . from the la silla - quest kbo survey , an unusual member of this high - inclination population , 2010 wg9 with perihelion @xmath18au ,",
    "@xmath19au , and @xmath20 has been discovered ( schwamb et al . 2011 ) .",
    "as the high-@xmath1 objects spend only a tiny fraction of their time near the ecliptic plane , surveys for kbos have poor sensitivity to them . with this strong observational bias , we can not rule out a much wider inclination distribution of plutinos compared to that of observed ones .",
    "several studies have been done to explore the inclination dependence of the orbital dynamics of plutinos , and the long - term stability is confirmed for @xmath21 ( duncan et al .",
    "1995 ; morbidelli 1997 ; melita & brunini 2000 ; nesvorn & roig 2000 ; lykawka & mukai 2007 ; tiscareno & malhotra 2009 ) . the purpose of this paper is to extend previous works to a somewhat wider range of inclinations , up to @xmath22 according to currently observed plutinos .",
    "furthermore , potential plutinos with @xmath23 have also been taken into account , in order to obtain a complete view of plutinos on all prograde orbits .",
    "as we shall see , plutinos may be classified into two groups in terms of a critical inclination about @xmath24 based on their dynamical behaviors .    in the first resonance sweeping models ( malhotra 1993 , 1995 ; gomes 1997 ) ,",
    "the primordial planetesimal disk was naturally assumed to be in dynamically cold orbital conditions ( low values of inclination and eccentricity ) , because it represented the early solar system after the formation of the planets . in this way , it was possible to explain the origin of the eccentricities of pluto and the other few plutinos locked in the 2:3 nmmr known at that time .",
    "and for pluto s large inclination ( @xmath25 ) , malhotra ( 1998 ) proposed a hypothetical excitation process : an inclination increase by the sweeping @xmath26 secular resonance ( the frequency of a planetesimal s nodal precession coincides with that of neptune ) , followed by a trapping into the 2:3 nmmr , and later an extra inclination excitation due to the kozai mechanism ( the libration of the argument of perihelion of a planetesimal ) .",
    "gomes ( 2000 ) examined the similar scenario in more detail , showing that most of the inclination increase is produced by the effective @xmath26 secular resonance before the 2:3 nmmr arrives .",
    "however , in such a scenario the maximum @xmath1 can not achieve higher than @xmath27 , while the eccentricity @xmath28 undergoes large increase due to the @xmath29 secular resonance ( the frequency of a planetesimal s perihelion precession matches that of neptune ) , inconsistent with the current @xmath28-@xmath1 distribution of observed plutinos ( fig .",
    "[ observed ] ) .",
    "later , gomes ( 2003 ) suggested that the high - inclination plutinos are originated from eccentric neptune - crossing orbits around 25au by dynamical scatterings , and have their orbits circularized on the path to the 2:3 nmmr ; while the population with low @xmath1 is expected to have been formed in a more distant area from the sun .",
    "thus , the various formation environments such as the temperature and the pressure could result in different surface colors of the high- and low - inclination groupings ( trujillo & brown 2002 ) . but in a recent paper , sheppard ( 2012 ) reported that plutinos have no apparent inclination - color correlation from observations .    in the framework of the @xmath30 model , a planetesimal disk with its outer edge interior to the position of the 1:2 nmmr at the time of the planetary instability",
    "is considered as the source of the high - inclination kbos ( tsiganis et al .",
    "2005 ; levison et al .",
    "there was a time when uranus and neptune experienced a short but violent phase , the inclinations of disk particles would be stirred up dramatically .",
    "meanwhile , if the eccentricity of neptune exceeded 0.15 , the nmmrs interior to the 1:2 nmmr overlapped one another .",
    "thus the region from neptune s orbit to the 1:2 nmmr became a chaotic sea , throughout which the high - inclination population could swim outwards freely , and some of them were captured by the 2:3 nmmr in the following evolution .",
    "the @xmath28-@xmath1 distribution of survivors in the 2:3 nmmr resembles that of observed plutinos very well , regardless of a deficit of objects with @xmath31 .",
    "some other mechanisms have also been proposed to account for the inclination excitation of kbos .",
    "morbidelli & valsecchi ( 1997 ) , petit , morbidelli & valsecchi ( 1999 ) and lykawka & mukai ( 2008 ) showed that large planetesimals were likely scattered by one of the jovian planets , then they could have pumped up @xmath28 and @xmath1 of the vast majority of kbos .",
    "ida , larwood & burkert ( 2000 ) and kobayashi , ida & tanaka ( 2005 ) suggested that if an early encounter with a stellar of one solar mass and a perihelion distance on the order of 100au occurred in the past , most objects in the primordial kuiper belt could acquire high values of @xmath1 , which are limited by the inclination of the passing star relative to the midplane of planetesimal disk .",
    "chiang et al . (",
    "2007 ) argued that during the era of planetary system formation , a few neptune - mass oligarchs existed between 20au and 40au may have stimulated the kbos orbits before they were finally removed .",
    "following nagasawa & ida ( 2000 ) , li , zhou & sun ( 2008 ) pointed out that , the kbos can be excited to @xmath32 via the sweeping @xmath33 secular resonance ( the frequency of a planetesimal s perihelion precession is close to that of jupiter ) .    taken in total , many works focus on how to raise @xmath1 under possible perturbations , but there is also evidence indicating that the planetesimal disk has been dynamically heated prior to the onset of the planet migration .",
    "we know that , for objects locked in the 2:3 nmmr with @xmath34 , their @xmath1 can not be modified significantly during both the migration epoch ( gomes 2000 , 2003 ; li et al .",
    "2011 ) and the later gyr time evolution near 39.4au ( volk & malhotra 2011 ) .",
    "this suggests that plutinos should have already possessed their high @xmath1 before they were hijacked into the 2:3 nmmr , and approximately conserved @xmath1 values from that point forward .",
    "in addition , wiegert et al .",
    "( 2003 ) examined the capture of particles into the 2:3 nmmr by the effect of neptune s in situ accretion , and they showed that pluto should have arisen from an initial high - inclination ( @xmath35 ) orbit . in this paper",
    ", we present new insights on neptune s migration into a three - dimensional planetesimal disk , and attempt to get some deterministic results about the role of @xmath1 in the origin of high - inclination plutinos . since it is natural to restrict the maximum initial @xmath1 of primordial planetesimals to the possible @xmath1-range of stable plutinos , the study of a previously inclined population may provide novel constraints on the early history of the outer solar system .",
    "the present manuscript aimed at the dynamics of the high - inclination plutinos is planed as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe some particular features of the 2:3 nmmr for inclined orbits .",
    "and we also derive the minimum of the resonant amplitude as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "section 3 discusses the stability of high - inclination objects in the 2:3 nmmr for times up to the age of the solar system , and shows that the stable region covers the whole inclination space of @xmath36 .",
    "based on this argument , in section 4 we investigate in detail the evolution of test particles with initial @xmath1 as high as @xmath2 in the planet migration and resonance sweeping model .",
    "finally , the conclusions and discussion are given in section 5 .",
    "considering the restricted three - body model that consists of the sun , neptune and a plutino , we can write the disturbing function in the heliocentric coordinates ( murray & dermott 1999 ) @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the constant of gravitation , the mass and the position vector , respectively . the subscript @xmath41 refers to neptune and no subscript indicates plutino .",
    "we will assume in this section that neptune is on a circular and zero - inclination orbit around the sun .",
    "we regard a small body as a plutino if the critical argument of the 2:3 nmmr @xmath42 librates , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the mean longitude and the longitude of perihelion .",
    "since the change rate of @xmath45 is slow , we can average the disturbing function ( [ df ] ) over the fast variable @xmath46 to remove it .",
    "for the plutino at the location of nominal resonance with neptune , i.e. , @xmath47 , we have @xmath48 for fixed values of @xmath49 and the longitude of ascending node @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is deduced from equation ( [ angle ] ) . the integration interval of equation ( [ df2 ] )",
    "is adopted to be the time spent between successive conjunctions of the plutino and neptune , i.e. , 3 times the neptune s orbital period of @xmath52 .    in order to evaluate @xmath53 for the 2:3 nmmr",
    ", we follow the technique developed by gallardo ( 2006a , 2006b ) .",
    "first of all , since the resonant angle @xmath45 is invariant to changes in aries in the circular restricted three - body problem , aries is taken as the ascending node .",
    "then @xmath50 could be set to be 0 , and @xmath44 equals to the argument of perihelion @xmath54 .",
    "secondly , the slowly evolving @xmath45 is assumed to be constant during the above integration interval , which is much shorter than the resonant period , then @xmath55 could be calculated from equation ( [ df ] ) . finally , we obtain the averaged disturbing function @xmath53 , which depends only on a given set of fixed values of ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "( black curve ) and the argument of perihelion @xmath54 ( blue curve ) for a typical inclined plutino with @xmath57 .",
    "the red curve represents the secular behavior of @xmath45 , and the green curve corresponds to the temporal variation of the slc ( see text for the definition).,width=340 ]    next , we will determine the libration center of the 2:3 nmmr using @xmath53 for a series of @xmath45 between 0 and @xmath52 . here",
    "we refer to such libration center as the special libration center ( slc ) . to do this",
    "we introduce lagrange s planetary equations , which give the time derivative of the semimajor axis @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the mean motion .",
    "as @xmath60 is proportional to @xmath61 , the minimum of @xmath53 defines the slc for a specific set of ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "gallardo ( 2006b ) described the general behavior for the 2:3 exterior resonance : there are two slcs at @xmath63 and @xmath64 for low - inclination orbits ; but for high - inclination orbits , the position of the slc strongly depends on @xmath54 .",
    "it is important to note that the change of the slc has a direct influence towards the resonant amplitude .",
    "here we designate the mean value of @xmath45 during the evolution as the general libration center ( glc ) , and the resonant amplitude as the maximum deviation from the glc . by definition ,",
    "a particle inhabits the exact resonance if its resonant amplitude is equal to zero .",
    "however , this resonant configuration can never be achieved so long as the particle moves on an inclined orbit . using the direct numerical integration ,",
    "we illustrate in fig .",

    "[ e005i30 ] , the temporal variation of @xmath45 of p1 is a composition of the secular and short - period behaviors .",
    "so we performed an fft low pass filter to @xmath45 to extract the low - frequency term @xmath71 , as indicated by the red curve in fig .",
    "[ e005i30 ] .",
    "we find that the libration period of @xmath71 coincides very well with half the circulation period of @xmath54 .",
    "this can be understood by looking at the time derivative of the resonant angle @xmath72 which has two fundamental frequencies @xmath73 and @xmath74 . because @xmath75 is much smaller than @xmath76 for inclined plutinos ,",
    "the variation of @xmath54 is responsible for the secular behavior of @xmath45 , i.e. , the temporal evolution of @xmath71 . keeping in mind that the slc is also sensitively dependent on @xmath54",
    ", we calculate it for specific values of @xmath77 and @xmath54 from p1 s instantaneous orbit .",
    "the temporal behavior of the slc is plotted as the green curve in fig .",
    "[ e005i30 ] .",
    "the high - degree overlap between red and green curves demonstrates that the secular behavior @xmath71 could be essentially identical to the variation of the slc , which is not a constant anymore for high - inclination plutinos .",
    "the amplitude of the slc is about @xmath78 corresponding to a low frequency @xmath79 , and the oscillating of @xmath45 superposed on the slc with a high frequency @xmath80 has an amplitude about @xmath81 .",

    "high - inclination plutinos the amplitude of the slc predicts the resonant amplitude s lower limit , denoted by @xmath82 .",
    "given three representative eccentricities of @xmath66 , 0.15 and 0.3 ( covering the observational range ) , we estimated the values of @xmath82 for plutinos with @xmath36 ( see fig .",

    "along with the increase of @xmath28 , the variation of the slc becomes less and less pronounced .",
    "when @xmath28 exceeds 0.3 , the values of @xmath82 are always on the order of smaller than @xmath27 for all prograde plutinos .",
    "it is necessary to stress that , the exact 2:3 nmmr with zero - amplitude libration will never arise unless in the two - dimensional planar three - body model , where the slc is fixed at @xmath70 or @xmath64 .",
    "in addition , we would like to mention that low - inclination plutinos librating around @xmath63 will lose stability if the perturbations of any other jovian planet besides neptune are taken into account .    in the following of this paper",

    "we hereafter denote the libration center of the 2:3 nmmr by @xmath87 ( i.e. , the glc ) , and the resonant amplitude by @xmath88 .",
    "to update the possible upper-@xmath1 cutoff of plutinos , we must first analyze the dynamical stability of high - inclination candidates populating in the 2:3 nmmr .",

    "the initial angles are chosen such that all particles start from @xmath99 , @xmath67 ( the libration center of @xmath54 associated with the kozai mechanism ) and @xmath100 ( the longitude of ascending node of pluto ) .",
    "the massless particles are gravitationally affected by , but not affecting the other bodies . in this paper we employ the swift_rmvs3 symplectic integrator developed by levison & duncan ( 1994 ) .",
    "we use a time step of 0.5 year , which is about 1/24 of the shortest orbital period ( jupiter ) in our model .    according to morbidelli ( 1997 ) , the dynamical structure of the 2:3 nmmr at small inclination",
    "can be simply characterized by the resonant amplitude @xmath0 , which determines the regular , chaotic and transition regions .",
    "this stability criterion warrants an extension to highly inclined orbits .",

    "firstly , we consider the dependence of resonant capture on the migration speed . from equation ( [ eq : variation ] )",
    "we can estimate the rate of the change of neptune s semimajor axis @xmath166 as @xmath167 according to the adiabatic invariant theory , to permit planetesimals to be captured into the 2:3 nmmr , the value of @xmath168 should be smaller than @xmath169au / yr for initial eccentricities of @xmath170 ( melita & brunini 2000 ) .",
    "namely , from equation ( [ eq : timescale ] ) , the migration timescale @xmath158 is demanded to be at least on the order of @xmath104 yr . with this in mind , we choose an order of magnitude larger @xmath171 yr .",
    "this value is derived from the orbital evolution of jovian planets embedded in a self - gravitating planetesimal disk in our previous work ( li et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "secondly , we would like to rule out the @xmath101-dependence .",
    "in numerical simulations we put all test particles initially at @xmath172au , where exterior to the initial 2:3 nmmr centered at @xmath173au and interior to the initial 1:2 nmmr at @xmath174au . in this way test particles can avoid the dynamical stirring from the sweeping 1:2 nmmr ahead ; thereafter they would stay on approximately original orbits and await the forthcoming 2:3 nmmr . besides , the strong @xmath126 secular resonance initially at 29.9au ( li et al .",
    "2008 ) could also be avoided .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the planetesimal disk was truncated around 35au ( gomes et al .",
    "2004 ; li et al .",
    "2011 ) . as the 2:3 nmmr sweeps from about 30.4 to 35au",
    ", its migration speed varies slightly and is always slow enough to be adiabatic .",
    "consequently , the planetesimals throughout this region likely face the similar fate as the ones located at 33au .",
    "we think that our equal-@xmath101 simulations may provide important insights into the orbital evolution of inclined plutinos .",
    "thirdly , with regard to the @xmath28-dependence , the probability of resonant capture has been given by dermott el al .",
    "if a planetesimal encounters the 2:3 nmmr having @xmath28 smaller than a critical value @xmath175 ( for @xmath176au / yr ) , then the adiabatic resonant trapping is certain . in consideration of @xmath28 fluctuations created by solar and planetary perturbations ,",
    "the initial @xmath28 is taken to be 0.01 , ensuring test particles to approach the 2:3 nmmr with @xmath177 .",
    "on the basis of above arguments , we performed a series of runs in which the initial inclination @xmath5 is treated as the only adjustable parameter .",
    "for each value of @xmath5 between @xmath98 and @xmath2 ( @xmath178 ) in a run , 200 test particles with the same @xmath101 ( 33au ) and @xmath28 ( 0.01 ) are introduced .",

    "gomes ( 1997 ) indicated that the expression @xmath181 is almost constant after the planetesimal has been trapped into the @xmath182 mean motion resonance .",
    "this can be deduced explicitly from the disturbing function or the jacobi constant in the restricted three - body problem . thus if the planetesimal falls into the 2:3 nmmr from the nearly - circular and coplanar orbit , and",
    "is subsequently pushed outwards by this resonance during neptune s migration , its @xmath28 and @xmath1 would obey the relation @xmath183 where @xmath184 is the semimajor axis of neptune at the moment of resonant capture , and @xmath185 is the final value about 30au . by looking at equation ( [ eivalue ] ) ,",
    "if @xmath1 increases from @xmath70 to @xmath186 during the phase of resonance lock , neptune has to begin its journey interior to 10.7au .",

    "this seems to be compatible with the unbiased inclination distribution of the kuiper belt determined by brown ( 2001 ) .",
    "he found that there is a tendency to have fewer plutinos concentrated at increasing inclinations for @xmath199 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath188 merely reflects , regardless of other dynamical processes , the influence of @xmath1 on the capture and retainment of the sweeping 2:3 nmmr . while the intrinsic capture efficiency is also affected by the overlap of nmmrs when neptune s eccentricity was large ( levison et al .",
    "2008 ) , the scattering encounters with jovian planets or massive planetesimals , the competition of the 1:2 nmmr , etc . however , these factors are beyond the scope of our paper and will not be discussed here .",

    "this is very important since it could constrain any mechanism of the origin of high - inclination plutinos , providing the requisite pre - heating in @xmath1 .",
    "opposite to the variation of @xmath1 , @xmath28 suffers damping due to the kozai effect , but could hardly attain value below 0.1 .    from the evolution of population 2 ( @xmath200 ) , we find that @xmath188 increases from a minimum @xmath201 for @xmath202 , to @xmath203 for @xmath204 and @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast with the case of population 1 , the turnover in @xmath188 at larger @xmath5 is unexpected .",
    "one immediate conjecture is that , the variation of @xmath188 may have some potential link to min@xmath0 ( see table 1 ) , which decreases with increasing @xmath5 for captured plutinos from population 2 .",
    "naturally , with more inclined orbits , certain objects possessing relatively smaller @xmath0 could be appended to the 2:3 nmmr zone .",
    "similarly , this hypothesis can also be accounted for the variation of @xmath188 for population 1 , as min@xmath0 increases with @xmath5 .",
    "for the inclination up to @xmath186 , the same correlation between @xmath1 and min@xmath0 has already been predicted in wiegert et al .",

    "both @xmath101 and @xmath28 are driven up by the migrating 2:3 nmmr , we have @xmath211 .",
    "this implies that the direction of the change of @xmath1 is determined by the sign of @xmath212 according to equation ( [ doti ] ) . for a planetesimal having @xmath213 ( i.e. , @xmath8 )",
    ", @xmath212 is always negative , thus its @xmath1 must decrease , as in the case of population 2 . at this point",
    "we want to emphasize that , such decrease in @xmath1 from the very beginning of the 2:3 nmmr trapping is not the kozai effect , and it continues until the end of the migration .",
    "it is of great interest that , we observe in the simulations some captured plutinos moving on nearly - circular orbits with @xmath125 .",
    "as we discussed above , the kozai mechanism alone seems unable to bring plutinos to such a low-@xmath28 mode .",
    "a careful checking on the possible dynamical mechanisms shows that the major factor is the 7:11 inclination - type nmmr .",
    "a typical example has been shown in fig . [ 7to11mmr ] . at about 3 myr after the start of the integration , the planetesimal is captured into the 7:11 inclination - type nmmr , as diagnosed by the libration of the critical argument @xmath206 ( second panel from the top ) .",
    "this resonance can only involve the inclinations of trapped objects but not the eccentricities .",

    "the 7:11 inclination - type nmmr maintains up to around @xmath216 yr , and then the planetesimal diffuses out of this resonance near 38.5au . in the subsequent evolution",
    ", the planetesimal stays there until the following 2:3 nmmr picks it up around @xmath217 yr , and it finally reaches a plutino - type orbit near 39.4au . despite somewhat excitation by the migrating 2:3 nmmr , the planetesimal s mean eccentricity still undergoes low value episode below 0.1 and ends at roughly 0.055 .",
    "the above two - step capture process is very suggestive of the creation of low - eccentricity , high - inclination plutinos , and the number of such objects ( @xmath218 ) at different @xmath5 has been given in the last column of table 1 . as for the captured plutinos with @xmath125 generated in our model ,",
    "all of these objects have experienced the 7:11 nmmr dynamics . however , the resonant capture by the sweeping 7:11 inclination - type nmmr is possible only for highly inclined planetesimals , because the resonance s strength is proportional to @xmath219 according to the disturbing function ( murray & dermott 1999 ) .",
    "consequently , no trapping into this high - order resonance could occur for planetesimals having relatively small @xmath1 ( e.g. , the case of @xmath220 ) .",
    "in order to better define a threshold of the inclination for triggering this resonance , we have conducted additional runs with @xmath221 , under a much higher resolution of @xmath222 .",
    "we placed 1000 test particles at each @xmath223 , and evolved the system using the same numerical procedures .",
    "the outcome yields that when @xmath224 , the 7:11 inclination - type nmmr appears , and the particular plutinos with @xmath125 can be generated at the level of @xmath225 out of a sample of 1000 at different @xmath5 .",
    "this range of a few percent is consistent with the obtained values in table 1 , i.e. , @xmath226 , @xmath227 and @xmath228 for @xmath229 , @xmath186 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "we further note that for population 2 , none of captured plutinos has small final @xmath28 .",
    "although the first step of the resonant capture by the 7:11 inclination - type nmmr could take place , the duration of this event is too short .",
    "the planetesimals would be released from the 7:11 inclination - type nmmr not far away from their original locations , and then recaptured by the 2:3 nmmr , in which longer radial shift results in larger @xmath28 .      for most of captured plutinos coming from our simulations , their @xmath54 librate when they are close to the inner branch of the separatrices of the 2:3 nmmr .",
    "this phenomenon can be accounted for their high @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , wan & huang ( 2007 ) pointed out that , if an object is inside the 2:3 nmmr under the present orbital configuration of neptune , the minimum inclination required for the appearance of the kozai mechanism is just about @xmath98 . in our model",
    "the critical inclination should be even smaller as neptune starts closer to the sun .",
    "however , since the near - separatrix motion is chaotic , the occurrence of the kozai mechanism at the very early stage of the migration is transient and can only last over several kozai cycle periods .",
    "as the orbital migration of test particles locked in the 2:3 nmmr continues , a number of them find their way back to the kozai mechanism . recorded in table 1 ,",

    ", @xmath1 would undergo large increase phase on the timescale of million years , which is in conflict with the fact that a particle with @xmath8 locked in the outward - migrating 2:3 nmmr must have its @xmath1 decreased all the time according to equation ( [ doti ] ) .",
    "thus the coupling of the 2:3 nmmr and the kozai mechanism is unlikely to maintain for population 2 . unless for a few lucky captured plutinos with @xmath202 , once their @xmath1 decrease to below @xmath24 forced by the sweeping 2:3 nmmr , they have opportunities to encounter the kozai mechanism .",
    "here we would like to stress that , the above argument does not exclude a temporary libration of @xmath54 near the separatrix of the 2:3 nmmr ( e.g. , at the beginning of the resonance encounter mentioned previously ) , where the motion is chaotic .",
    "a comment on the validity of equation ( [ doti ] ) for the cessation of the kozai mechanism must be made here .",
    "as shown in gomes ( 1997 ) , an equivalent form of equation ( [ doti ] ) can be derived using the explicit disturbing function , which considers angels @xmath242 where @xmath243 and @xmath244 are integers .",
    "if an object is experiencing both the 2:3 nmmr and the kozai mechanism , the associated critical arguments can be expressed as ( wan & huang 2007 ) @xmath245 where @xmath246 are integers and @xmath247 , @xmath248 .",
    "it is quite obvious that @xmath249 , and therefore , equation ( [ doti ] ) does include the dynamics of the kozai mechanism inside the 2:3 nmmr .",
    "so the above result is valid for explaining the absence of kozai plutinos with @xmath8 .",
    "in recent years , a few kbos on extremely inclined orbits ( @xmath250 ) have been discovered .",
    "thus it is of great interest to build up a picture of the possible high - inclination population throughout the kuiper belt . in this paper , we present the results of the study of the dynamics of plutinos with @xmath1 up to @xmath2 .    by making use of a semi - analytical model based on the simplified disturbing function , we first investigated the particular features of the 2:3 nmmr for inclined orbits .",
    "we have defined the special libration center ( slc ) of the resonant angle @xmath45 at the minimum of the averaged disturbing function @xmath53 . unlike low - inclination plutinos , for high - inclination ones their slcs",
    "are no longer fixed but strongly dependent on @xmath54 ( gallardo 2006b ) .",
    "nevertheless , there is a general libration center ( glc ) @xmath105 at @xmath64 , which is achieved over the timescale several times longer than a single libration period . the maximum excursion of @xmath45 from @xmath105 measures the resonant amplitude @xmath0 .",
    "we have shown that high - inclination plutinos always possess substantial @xmath0 due to the variation of the slcs , thus they would never settle at the exact 2:3 nmmr ( i.e. , @xmath106 ) .",
    "the resonant amplitude s lower limit @xmath82 increases with @xmath1 , and achieves the value about @xmath251 when @xmath252 .    under the perturbations of four jovian planets , the orbits of thousands of test particle plutinos with high inclinations ( @xmath253 ) were integrated for times up to the age of the solar system .",
    "we find that the inclinations of stable orbits inside the 2:3 nmmr could be as high as @xmath2 . in the dynamical map on the initial ( @xmath254 ) plane",
    ", the stable regions are mainly delimited by the resonant amplitude @xmath0 less than about @xmath255 , and this critical value is always larger than the prescribed lower limits @xmath82 .",
    "we also notice some complex dynamical structures in the 2:3 nmmr . for the case of small @xmath28 , outside the narrow stable bands extending to @xmath92 near the resonance center at @xmath122au , the stable and unstable regions interlace with one another .",
    "this is caused by the appearance of the kozai mechanism , which generally has a destabilizing effect on the high - inclination plutinos with @xmath256 .",
    "while for the case of moderate to large @xmath28 , when @xmath257 , the instability occupies the resonance center due to the temporary state of the kozai mechanism , but a few resonant orbits with relatively large @xmath0 could still be stable over 4 gyr ; when @xmath135 or @xmath258 , a wide neighborhood of the resonance center is almost surrounded by stable orbits .",
    "the two limits @xmath134 and @xmath137 are only certain for a specific @xmath28 , and both shift to larger values with increasing @xmath28 . based on our results ( see fig .",
    "[ stability ] ) , their tentative values are suggested to be @xmath147 and @xmath148 for @xmath110 ; @xmath149 and @xmath150 for @xmath111 .",
    "these quantities represent boundaries that divide stable and unstable regions within the 2:3 nmmr .    with respect to the mechanism of the 2:3 nmmr sweeping and capture during neptune s migration",
    ", further simulations have been undertaken to investigate the possibility of the outward transportation of planetesimals on inclined orbits . in our model ,",
    "neptune started at 23au with a migration timescale @xmath171 yr , and all test particles were initially at 33au .",
    "the results show that the resonant capture and retainment is allowed for any initial inclination @xmath259 .",
    "and of surviving objects in the 2:3 nmmr at the end of the migration , we define captured plutinos as ones moving on resonant orbits with @xmath119 according to the above stability analysis .    as for captured plutinos obtained in our simulations",
    ", they may be classified into two groups : population 1 with @xmath194 and population 2 with @xmath200 .",
    "our principal findings to these two populations can be generalized as follows :    \\(1 ) population 1 has the inclination within the range of the observed values for plutinos",
    ". referred to our migration model , the capture efficiency @xmath188 of the sweeping 2:3 nmmr decays from @xmath260 for @xmath196 , to @xmath261 for @xmath198 . for captured plutinos with high @xmath5 here ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath1-excitation is less than @xmath7 during planetary migration , indicating the existence of a stirred - up transneptunian disk prior to resonance sweeping .",
    "most importantly , some captured plutinos are found to move on nearly - circular orbits with final @xmath125 .",
    "we find that all of these objects are first captured into the 7:11 inclination - type nmmr .",
    "as they migrate outwards locked in this resonance , their @xmath28 always remain at @xmath262 , oscillating but undergoing no net growth .",
    "when these planetesimals approach the location near @xmath263au , they are released from the 7:11 inclination - type nmmr in the low-@xmath28 mode , and then picked up by the following 2:3 nmmr . despite somewhat excitation in the subsequent evolution",
    ", their @xmath28 would end at @xmath264 .",
    "this mechanism for the creation of nearly - circular plutinos requires @xmath265 .    among the captured plutinos from population 1",
    ", we obtained a total of 10 objects with @xmath125 and @xmath266 .",
    "however , there are only 5 real plutinos resided in the same subgroup . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the intrinsic number of such low-@xmath28 and high-@xmath1 plutinos may differ significantly in an unbiased distribution ( i.e. , bias favors discovery of high-@xmath28 and low-@xmath1 objects ) .",
    "based on the model by gladman et al .",
    "( 2012 ) from the canada - france ecliptic plane survey ( cfeps ) , the population of plutinos with @xmath125 is estimated to be about 490 ( diameter @xmath267 km ) .",
    "since none of the characterized cfeps plutinos with @xmath125 has inclination smaller than @xmath98 , the intrinsic number of low-@xmath28 and high-@xmath1 ones would be on the order of several hundred and they should draw more attention . here , we just intend to propose a new mechanism that may generate the low-@xmath28 , high-@xmath1 plutinos , while the intrinsic fraction of plutinos in this particular group remains to be determined by performing more detailed modeling .",
    "\\(2 ) with regard to population 2 , contrary to what one might expect , the capture efficiency @xmath188 turns to increase with the inclination , from @xmath201 for @xmath202 to 31% for @xmath204 and @xmath2 .",
    "the considerable value of @xmath188 implies that a much wider @xmath1-distribution of plutinos is theoretically possible . another interesting point with the captured plutinos from population 2",
    "is that , all of them have their @xmath1 decreased by several degrees .",
    "we find that such @xmath1-damping is certain to occur for any planetesimal with @xmath8 caught into the outward sweeping 2:3 nmmr .",
    "an important production of this mechanism is to prohibit the trapping of population 2 into the coupled 2:3 nmmr and kozai mechanism , since an inclination increase induced by the latter would not be allowed .    in order to highlight the effects of the high - inclination on the push - out mechanism , we rule out the @xmath101-dependence in our model , namely setting initial semimajor axis @xmath268au for all test particles . in this way",
    "the influence of the strong 1:2 nmmr and @xmath126 secular resonance could be avoided . however , a discussion of different @xmath269 in the primordial disk is certainly due .",
    "since the migration of neptune is modeled with exponential behavior , the speed of the 2:3 nmmr sweeping will decay in the same way when moving from its initial location until reaching @xmath122au . as we know",
    ", in the standard framework of the resonant capture mechanism during planetary migration , the capture probability of objects into a nmmr depends on the sweeping rate of the resonance . the slower this rate , the higher the capture probability and at the same time the smaller the minimum eccentricity necessary for capture . to assess the role of @xmath269 in the capture and evolution of high - inclination plutinos , we have made two additional runs with @xmath269 of 31au and 35au . combining with the case of @xmath268au",
    "we find that the capture probability @xmath188 does undergo some degree of change since the 2:3 nmmr sweeps distinct @xmath269 at different rates . in spite of",
    "this fact , for each particular @xmath269 , the decreasing ( increasing ) trend of @xmath188 with the increasing @xmath5 for population 1 ( 2 ) is still the same as in table 1 ; and our other main results reported in section 4 are hardly affected .",
    "it can be expected that , even if a full disk at @xmath270au is considered on further examination , the remarkable influences of the initial high inclination obtained from a single @xmath269=33au are intrinsic .    in the model tested here for @xmath268au ,",
    "although we managed to avoid the dynamical influence of the important first - order 1:2 nmmr , the same can not be done about the second - order resonances , i.e. , the 3:5 nmmr initial at @xmath271au . at the end of our @xmath272 yr migration simulations , only two of all survived test particles are detected in the 3:5 nmmr .",
    "both of them are from the case of @xmath196 , while none of more inclined particles are captured .",
    "this suggests that the 3:5 nmmr has a considerably low capture probability for bodies with high inclinations , and plays little role in sweeping the 33au location .",
    "however , it is quite possible that other higher order nmmrs ( or even other types of resonances ) , in addition to the inclination - type 7:11 nmmr , may be important if the full disk is used in the modeling .    with regard to the effect of initial eccentricity @xmath273 on the adiabatic resonance capture into the 2:3 nmmr , we performed one extra run with @xmath274 for @xmath268au .",
    "as suspected , even the capture probability @xmath188 drops off for larger @xmath273 , the major conclusions about the @xmath5-dependence of plutinos that we have found can also be obtained .",
    "in the future work , we are giving a throughout analysis to the high - inclination twotinos in the 1:2 nmmr , where the resonance structure is much different .",
