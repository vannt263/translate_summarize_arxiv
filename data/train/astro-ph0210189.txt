    "the @xmath2cephei variable bwvul ( hr8007 , hd199140 ; b1v to b2iii ) is in kinematic terms the largest amplitude pulsator known in the galaxy .",
    "its fundamental radial pulsation mode ( stamford & watson 1981 , aerts 1995 ) is so strongly excited as to produce discontinuous  standstill \" features in the star s light curve and , immediately following this , a longer standstill in the radial velocity curve as well .",
    "these features result from highly nonlinear processes associated with upward propagating pulsation waves .",
    "these waves emerge into the photosphere as highly supersonic shocks . during the pulsation cycle ,",
    "the optical line profiles remain in absorption but undergo extreme variations in shape and velocity .",
    "equivalent width variations are also noticeable at certain phases . in the often - used convention that @xmath3 = 0 occurs at light maximum ( minimum radius ) ,",
    "the radial velocity standstill becomes centered at @xmath3 = 0.98 - 1.00 .",
    "line profiles exhibit double lobes at phases just before ( centered at @xmath3 @xmath4 0.90 ) , and during some cycles just after ( @xmath3 @xmath4 0.06 ) the velocity standstill phase ( e.g. , mathias et al . 1998 ) .",
    "adding to the complexity of description , the radial velocity curve is somewhat sensitive to the method of measurement , the spectral and temporal resolution of the observation , and especially to the momentary pulsational amplitude of the star , for the amplitude of the pulsations fluctuate by several percent from night to night ( crowe & gillet 1989 , aerts et al .",
    "1995 , mathias et al .",
    "1998 , garnier et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the equivalent widths of some metal lines vary with phases as a function of excitation potential ( furenlid et al .",
    "the finite signal - to - noise ratio and temporal sampling frequency of the _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ observations set practical limits on the otherwise considerable complementary uv information that they offer to optical spectra .    despite these observational limitations , important effects of the star s pulsation cycle",
    "are readily visible on the atmosphere .",
    "one of these is a variation of the effective surface gravity and especially the instantaneous  effective temperature \" of the star during the cycle .",
    "recently , stickland & lloyd ( 2002 ) have compared flux variations at a range of wavelengths from the far - uv to the near - uv to show that the effective temperature varies from 20,000k to 25,000k during the cycle .",
    "temperature variations this large may well cause observable modulations in the mass loss and x - ray luminosity ( cf . cohen",
    "2000 ) of the cycle .",
    "historically , controversy has surrounded the interpretations of the profile and strength variations caused by shock waves moving through the atmosphere of bwvul .",
    "one of these is the so - called  van hoof effect , \" named after its primary discoverer ( van hoof & struve 1953 ) .",
    "this effect is the purported phase lag between the velocity curves extracted from lines formed at different atmospheric depths .",
    "this is thought to be the result of the finite travel time required for a pulsational shock wave to move up from one region of line formation to another . in the most recent such report , mathias et al .",
    "( 1998 ) reported that double line profiles of various lines observed near @xmath3 @xmath4 0.9 and sometimes 0.1 can exhibit equal blue - red strengths at slightly different phases .",
    "a related issue is the cause of the line doubling itself .",
    "odgers ( 1955 ) and goldberg , walker , & odgers ( 1976 ) first attributed the velocity discontinuities to atmospheric absorptions just below and above the shock .",
    "these authors argued that as an upward - propagating pulsation wave breaks into a shock it accelerates the line forming regions of the atmosphere from the lower photosphere , thereby creating a density discontinuity with respect to the lower photosphere .",
    "the semi - ejected  shell \" coasts to some maximum height and returns ballistically to these lower strata .",
    "in contrast , young , furenlid , & snowden ( 1981 ; yfs ) suggested that turbulence and pressure effects are the chief causes of the profile doublings at these phases .",
    "in their picture the standstills are caused by line formation in both a lower stationary atmospheric region as well as an infalling zone rendered transparent by its lower density .",
    "all these studies have pointed to the extended displacements of the line formation region ( several percent of a stellar radius ) as well as its virtual free fall from maximum to minimum radius .    in the most recent kinematical description , mathias et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and garnier et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have summarized the present consensus that there are two shocks per cycle .",
    "the first ,  pulsation , \" shock is the result of the evolution of the upward - propagating wave which grows in amplitude from the envelope where it is excited . as it emerges into the atmosphere at @xmath5 , this shock has a moderately high mach ( 5 - 7 ) number , as referenced by the velocity  discontinuity \" just prior to the velocity standstill .",
    "a subsequent ,  infall , \" shock , occurring 0.8 cycles after the first , is due to the extreme compression of the upper atmospheric strata as they fall back and catch up to the slower moving layers of the lower photosphere . in this picture",
    "the line profiles exhibit double lobes during the main ( and often infall ) shock because of the velocity jump associated with it .",
    "mathias et al . also note that because the density of the atmosphere decreases monotonically outwards , the infalling region can not be described as a disconnected shell .",
    "in addition , mathias et al . suggested that shock progresses inward in terms of absolute ( eulerian ; radius from star center ) coordinates even as it moves outwards in mass .",
    "thus , their description reconciles the idea expressed by several previous authors that two outward - moving shocks per cycle propagate up through the atmosphere . in the past",
    "the infall shock , which forms at @xmath3 @xmath4 0.90 , has been mistaken for a reflection of a shock from the previous cycle off an interior density gradient discontinuity . in this study",
    "we adopt the view of mathias et al . that this shock is a natural consequence of infall , and that any earlier reflected shock is likely to be damped within the star , rendering it invisible at the surface .",
    "the elusiveness of even a qualitative interpretation of the shocks in bwvul has slowed the necessary development of self - consistent radiative hydrodynamical models .",
    "early on , stamford & watson ( 1978 ) assumed that a large - amplitude velocity piston at the base of the atmosphere developed into a thin , isothermal shock as it progressed through the line formation region . using this dynamical model atmosphere , they constructed line profiles of siiii @xmath04552 at several key phases in the cycle . profiles at phases we now call the infall shock exhibited line doubling ( albeit over only a brief interval ) . in subsequent work stamford & watson ( 1981 ) placed a large , adiabatic sinusoidal velocity variation at the base of a gray model atmosphere and demonstrated that an isothermal shock developed in the line formation region .",
    "although they did not compute line profiles in these simulations , stamford & watson stated that they anticipated that the shock would produce line doubling during the shock passage .",
    "the 1978 stamford & watson paper to date represents the only attempt to compute the line transfer for a spectral line in a moving model atmosphere appropriate to bwvul .",
    "recently , owocki & cranmer ( 2002 ) have developed hydrodynamic models that roughly simulate the velocity and light variations of the pulsating star .",
    "their models assume strong outgoing shocks in realistic atmospheres .",
    "the shocks begin in the envelope as a large - amplitude pulsation wave , break into a small - amplitude shock in the lower photosphere , and evolve into an isothermal , large - amplitude ( 60@xmath6 in density ) shock in the wind .",
    "owocki & cranmer s results show that the shock has the effect of flattening the atmospheric density gradient well out into the wind , thereby explaining the large range in phase over which the shock can be traced in the uv resonance lines .",
    "as these waves emerge into the wind , they can impact slower flows , causing reverse shocks and the formation of discrete absorption components ( dacs ) in the far blue wings , indeed as observed in the siiv and civ lines ( burger et al .",
    "1981 , blomme & hensberge 1985 , massa 1994 ) .",
    "the idea of a strong shock front moving through the atmosphere is of course not limited to @xmath2cephei variables .",
    "in fact , the concept of a vertically propagating  hot front \" was first used by merrill ( 1955 ) , referring to line doubling in both absorption and emission lines in long period variable stars .",
    "while this still represents the common interpretation of this spectroscopic phenomenon in the lpv stars ( e.g. , alvarez et al . 2000 ) , the idea of shocks heating the atmosphere have not taken root in most discussions of the dynamics of the bwvul atmosphere .",
    "this is perhaps because emission components have not been observed in bwvul s spectrum .",
    "in fact , the only evidence given for shock dissipation and heating appeared rather recently , in furenlid et al.s ( 1987 ) discussion of variable oii lines . the subject has been virtually ignored since , and we will revive this discussion in this paper .",
    "the present paper was motivated partially by our impression that an understanding of the shock wave properties has been hampered by uncertainties in spectroscopic measurements and interpretation .",
    "for example , yfs and crowe & gillet ( 1989 ) found widely different _ average _ equivalent widths for the important cii @xmath16578 - 82 lines .",
    "large \" values found by yfs during the distension phases formed the basis of their conclusion that line doubling and strengthening is caused by changes in atmospheric continuous opacity .",
    "this suggestion though oft - quoted has gone untested . we also realized in planning our program that the existence of a van hoof effect could be tested by comparing the responses of the red hei @xmath05875 ( triplet ) and @xmath06678 ( singlet ) lines , which probe slightly different column lengths through their @xmath7 difference , and also volume densities because of the triplet line s mild sensitivity to density through the partial metastability of its lower level .",
    "these lines have heretofore not been monitored in bwvul .",
    "other significant but so far unremarked lines in the red region are the siii @xmath06371 and siiii @xmath05737 features , which together provide a measure of variations in the atmosphere s ionization equilibrium .",
    "the echelle data we have obtained sample formation conditions of many lines at the same time and thus can provide accurate phasing information from this variable - amplitude pulsator .",
    "this simultaneity permits us to remove past ambiguities in correlating behaviors of various lines at different epochs . a second reason for undertaking this study is the availability of largely unanalyzed _ iue _ data from several cycles at nearly the same epoch .",
    "this dataset permits us to tie together the resonance lines and high - excitation optical lines formed deeper in the atmosphere at a large number of phase reference points in the pulsation cycle .",

    "note first that the siiii curve weakens ( rises ) more quickly than siiv strengths during the phase interval 0.70.9 .",
    "this is likely to be a consequence of si@xmath25 being the dominant ion in the atmosphere , and siiii responding ( decreasing in strength ) more readily to heating that accompanies the infall shock at @xmath3 @xmath4 0.9 .",

    "experimentation with extractions along the civ profile indicates that as one includes more and more blue wing ( wind absorption ) in the measurement , the onset and extension of the maximum - strength phase shifts to later and later phases .",
    "thus , this appearance of the shock as a long - lived feature in the wind is responsible for the positive phase shift of the  civ_blue \" and  niv_blue \" curves relative to the  civ_red \" plot in this figure .",
    "the combination of optical and uv resonance line results requires a picture which integrates the effects of the pulsation and infall - generated shocks .",
    "figures  [ fig_he2 ] , [ fig_alsi ] and [ fig_c4n5 ] record the differences in uv line responses with increasing ionization potential . massa ( 1994 ) has depicted the acceleration of civ , siiv , and siiii in grayscale _ iue _ 1979 spectra .",
    "these spectra show that the wind features start 0.1 cycles after the passage of the pulsation wave through the photosphere .",
    "the photospheric and wind components of civ are at times co - mingled , but otherwise there is no hint of a graduated response through the photosphere .",
    "rather , there seem to be separate responses from two discrete  photospheric \" and  wind \" regions .",
    "in particular , continuum fluxes and lines of high excitation , such as hei , heii , and siiii , show no perceptible phase differences in their velocity or line strength responses .",
    "even the line strength minima of the moderate excitation cii doublet ( @xmath19 = 14 ev ) seem to coincide with the appearance of the shocks just prior to and following the end of the velocity standstill .",
    "these lines collectively span a large range in excitation .",
    "lines arising from less excited levels than 14 ev , such as the resonance lines of aliii or moderate excitation lines of siiii ( stickland & lloyd 2002 ) , can not be measured precisely enough in _ iue _ spectra to search for phase lags with respect to the optical lines .",
    "in fact , we find that in order to see any obvious indication of a phase lag after the passage of the excited lines one must search in the far blue wings of the resonance lines . perhaps this should not be a surprise . according to the owocki & cranmer ( 2002 ) simulations , the uv absorption features form over length scales much longer than the effective depth of the static line formation region .",
    "thus , there is ample column length over which shock - induced features can develop .    if there are no phase delays among the excited optical lines , what is one to make in figure  [ fig_rvb ] of the apparent phase delay of 0.070.08 after the siii @xmath06371 curve ?",
    "we believe the key here is that si@xmath20 is a trace atmospheric ion , which is therefore sensitive to temperature and _ not _ that its mean line formation region is so high in the atmosphere that it takes the shock a finite time to reach it .",
    "consider as a more plausible circumstance that the formation regions of most optical lines largely overlap .",
    "the so - called  delayed \" weakenings of the siii feature may more easily represent the subsequent passage of a cooler medium .",

    "figure  [ fig_heprof ] illustrates that the cause of the equivalent width maximum of @xmath05875 at @xmath3 = 0.9 on each night is a strengthening of the blue wing . in these plots we exhibit this fact by multiplying the depth of @xmath06678 on the blue wing ( and also extreme red wing ) by a factor of 1.4 to 1.8 .",
    "figure  [ fig_heprof ] shows that blue wings of the @xmath06678 scaled by these factors indeed replicate the @xmath05876 absorptions at this phase .",
    "we see this phenomenon over a total range of 0.080.10 cycles centered on radial velocity maximum ( @xmath3@xmath40.91 ) on each of the three nights . in these various examples",
    "the limiting line - depth scaling factor appears to be about 2.0 .",
    "since this is also the @xmath7 ratio of the lines , it is likely that these extra absorptions are due to the medium at negative velocities being optically thin to hei line radiation .",
    "an alternative possibility , that the excess arises from metastability of @xmath05875 , is implausible because no such excess absorption is present in this line during the distension ( low - density ) phases at @xmath3 @xmath11 0.5 .",
    "if temperature variations cause the changes in the blue wings of the hei lines , there should be a similar response in the _ inner blue wing _ of the civ doublet members - the cores of the siiv lines are too broad to demonstrate this .",
    "figure  [ fig_c4 ] implies that the absorption - scaling argument is likely to be valid , that is , that an excess absorption at about 100 km  s@xmath8 of line center is caused by an optically thin column at these shifted wavelength .",

    "the reader will recall that young , furenlid , & snow ( 1981 ) first drew attention to cii variations during the cycle of bwvul and posited that the cii variations were the result of the lines growing anomalously strong outside the shock phases . to test this assertion ,",
    "we have synthesized the cii doublet with the hubeny _ synspec _ ( hubeny , lanz & jeffery 1994 ) line synthesis code using kurucz ( static ! ) model atmospheres . for an atmosphere having @xmath26k , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 kms@xmath8 , we found an equivalent width of 0.22 for @xmath06578 and a @xmath06578/@xmath06583 ratio of 1.14 .",

    "our modeling also shows that the strengths of these lines are quite insensitive to changes in temperature in the domain 2000025000k .",
    "the models do not confirm the speculation by ysf that changes in atmospheric density play a strong role in determining the line strength changes during the cycle .",
    "of course , the line strengths will increase appreciably with any microturbulence that might accompany the shocks , so this would not explain the decrease during these phases .",
    "the upshot of these calculations is that the decreases in cii strengths observed at shock phases can not be due to simple changes in atmospheric temperature or density .",
    "thus , our results suggest that the question to pose is not  why are the cii strengths large during the non - shock phases ? , \" but rather  _ why do the cii strengths decrease to smaller values than they should have during shock phases ? _ \" the question is critical to a discussion of the shocks in bw vul s atmosphere because the effects of temperature increases are obvious for other lines but lead to a contradiction for the response of the cii features . adding additional turbulence from a shock",

    ", width=317 ]      if enhancements of neither temperature nor turbulence can explain the line weakening , let us consider instead the effect of a flattening of the temperature gradient with atmospheric depth , particularly in the construct of an lte milne - eddington atmosphere . in this formulation the strengths of weak lines should simply be proportional to the gradient @xmath35 . to interpret the enhanced absorptions in the blue wings of the hei lines ( and possibly civ ) at @xmath3 = 0.9 , one should also consider the heating effects from infall of material above where a line is being formed . at this phase , upper strata are returning toward the surface at nearly free - fall velocities ( furenlid et al .",
    "strata just below them fall slightly more slowly , and so on , down to the fully - braked stationary layers .",
    "these combined decelerations produce compression over a broad range of layers .",
    "the result of this pile up is a conversion of differential flow velocity to local heating .",
    "indeed , this effect can be observed as the first maximum of the uvc and heii line strength curves at @xmath3 = 0.850.1 ( i.e. , at velocity maximum ) and by the _ disappearance _ of the cool - gas diagnostic , siii @xmath06371 , at the same times .",
    "heating will increase the number of atoms in excited states and thus should permit new optically thin absorption to appear in the excited hei lines .",
    "this absorption is formed in a still - falling column which is still high enough in the atmosphere to be optically thin to an external observer .",
    "most of the initial column density will be concentrated near the shock , so the lobe will appear at near - rest velocities .",
    "as this pile up proceeds , the threshold column density needed for visibility will recede ( moving upward , in eulerian coordinates ) , permitting the optically thin absorption in the profile to grow toward positive velocities until it runs into and merges with the optically thick red lobe .",
    "the process ceases when the deepest layers essentially at rest become optically thick to the observer . at this point , just after phase 0.0 , the entire profile becomes optically thick over a broad distribution of line velocities , both from the still - falling column and the strata at rest at the bottom .",
    "the standstill phase ends quickly as the material in the falling column is suddenly exhausted  the optical depth turns thin and to zero very quickly at wavelenths in the red lobe of the profile .    during the infall",
    "phase the velocity gradient can be expected to increase among the superficial , cooler layers , causing proportionally more heating there .",
    "thus , the weakening of the cii doublet ( first dip in fig .  [ fig_c2ew ] ) is consistent with a flattening of the gradient of the atmospheric temperature and line source functions .",
    "indeed , in the expectation of accompanying increased turbulence , it seems difficult to understand how the weakening could arise in any other way .",
    "the second dip of the cii curve features coinciding with the passage of the pulsation shock can be explained by a more fundamental characteristic : the shock has a tendency to be more nearly isothermal than in the preshock atmosphere .",
    "the above picture is sketched qualitatively in figure  [ fig_cartoon ] .",
    "this illustration depicts the evolution of the stellar radius ( top ) and the absorption profiles ( bottom ) during five phases ( @xmath3 ) , including one just prior to and one just following the primary shock passage interval .",

    "a broken line indicates where the atmosphere becomes optically thick across the line profile ( @xmath36 ) . whether absorption lines are formed in optically thick or thin layers is suggested by their proximity to this curve . in any case , while admitting the omission of critical details of transfer of photons across the profile as the line as it turns optically thick , it appears possible that we can understand the formation of the excess optically thin absorption in the blue wing of the hei lines as well as the weakening of the temperature - sensitive cii and siii lines .",
    "suffice it to say that in contrast to the infall shock the heating associated with the infall shock in our picture will extend over a broader range of strata in the atmosphere at any given moment than heating from the primary shock . if the uvc and heii and siii line curves are to be taken as diagnostics of atmospheric heating , the pulsation shock is more impulsive and liberates more heat per unit time than the infall shock .",
    "in contrast , according to the equivalent width curves of siii @xmath06371 , the heating from the infall shock not only lasts longer , but by differing amounts from cycle to cycle .",
    "this suggests that the details of this heating are driven by the strength of the earlier pulsation wave .",
    "also , as noted in @xmath15[hilo ] , the velocity jump criterion leads to the opposite inequality of apparent shock strengths , with the radial velocity jump to the standstill ( infall shock ) being typically larger than the jump at the end of the standstill ( primary shock ) .",
    "since the velocity and equivalent width variations measure different types of shock properties , this apparent disagreement of the inequalities need not be a contradiction to the model .",
    "in this paper we have emphasized the importance of shock heating accompanying the passage of both shocks through the formation regions of several lines having a large range of excitation potentials ( 041 ev ) .",
    "we have also pointed out by contrast that density variations are likely to play at most a minor role in the observed line strength changes .",
    "several studies have remarked in the past on some of the optical and uv signatures we have discussed in detail , but the variations in the past were attributed to kinematical , density , and/or finite propagation velocity effects  rarely heating . even the young et al .",
    "( 1987 ) study did not pursue the subject beyond noting that variations of temperature - sensitive lines .",
    "this general inattention to the subject was not made through an explicit error by any of these investigators .",
    "in fact , our own assessment of the importance of temperature effects could not have come about except through echelle observations over a broad wavelength range , particularly including the red hei lines .",
    "even so , the observation that the hei lines show strength variations due to atmospheric heating can not be the whole story .",
    "indeed , the realization that the cii doublet weakens during both shocks , and that the line strengths are insensitive to temperature variations , has all but forced the idea that the atmospheric temperature gradient is likely to be substantially flattened during shock passages .",
    "the heating of the atmosphere causes the column length of excited atoms to increase , but at the same time it causes the line source function gradient to decrease slowly outwards , thereby producing line weakening of the saturated lines especially , such as the cii doublet .    with this rough sketch in mind ,",
    "we believe the time is ripe for new investigations of bwvul to undertake a more quantitative analysis .",
    "this can begin with the abandonment of a static model atmosphere treatment , at least for the phase intervals in which shocks affect the atmosphere s thermal and density structure .",
    "another logical step is to construct  toy atmospheres \" in which radiative and/or hydrostatic equilibrium are abandoned to see what devices  work , \" and to give some insight into the construction of a new generation of hydrodynamic models of shocks . a line synthesis from such kinematical atmospheres , in the spirit of stamford &",
    "watson s early modeling , can point the way to a more correct treatment of line doubling / broadening and strenth variations .",

    "one needs to know just how much pile - up material above the photosphere is required to give each type of lines a blue lobe strength that is some chosen fraction ( say , one third ) of the strength of the red lobe . in principle , combining these column densities with the observed rate of pile up at a given level will permit a test of our hypothesis that the van hoof effect in this star s atmosphere is an artifact of the optical thinesses of the blue lobes of these lines .    in this paper the role of non - lte has not been discussed . however , transfer of photons through the line profile is ultimately essential to the testing of our ideas of how the excess blue wing can develop in the hei lines during the double - lobed infall - shock phase ( @xmath3 = 0.9 ) .",
    "the details of line transfer and amount of turbulence associated with the shocks are interrelated , and together they are critical to a description of these lines at these phases .",
    "another aspect of non - lte formation processes concerns the behavior of the hei lines during the low - density ( maximum radius ) phase .",
    "the equivalent widths of the triplet @xmath05875 line give no indication that metastability is important in the lower level ( 2@xmath37p ) of this transition , as would be expected for low ( supergiant - like ) atmospheric densities .",
    "this fact certainly means that the densities at this phase are not  too low , \" but what this means quantitatively needs to be demonstrated .",
    "an even more sensitive indicator of low densities is the hei @xmath010830 line . because of the importance of stimulated emission for infrared transitions , this feature is well known to exhibit a strong response to either  excess \" absorption or emission .",
    "the heating of the base and rapid - acceleration regions of the wind also remains to be evaluated .",
    "how hot these regions can become , and thus how much pulsational energy is dissipated in the atmosphere , can be addressed by far - uv ( _ fuse _ satellite ) observations of the ovi resonance doublet .",
    "finally , one wonders about the effects of shocks in the outer atmospheres of other @xmath2cep variables .",
    "campos & smith ( 1981 ) and smith ( 1983 ) examined high - resolution line profiles of several @xmath2cep stars and found signatures of velocity jumps they associated with shocks in either optical or uv lines of all five of the ones for which line profiles they examined . in an analysis of @xmath38eridani , smith ( 1983 ) argued that rapid changes during key phases in the velocity curve and optical siiii line profiles of this star suggest the presence of atmospheric shocks , though not necessarily discontinuities in a radial velocity curve .",
    "indeed , the equivalent width of the these lines grows probably due to the growth of a blue lobe .",
    "unfortunately , other nonradial pulsation modes are likely to confuse the investigation of shock signatures",
    ". a more promising candidate may be another large - amplitude variable , @xmath39scorpii .",
    "campos & smith ( 1980 ) have observed red - wing emission in the siiii triplet lines of this star near minimum velocity phase .",
    "could the heating associated with the pulsation shock in this star be occasionally so large as to produce emission ?",
    "this star s line profiles have apparently not yet been extensively monitored since , but it might be profitable to search for the cause of emission and to see how this relates to the larger - amplitude shock of bwvul for which no emissions are observed .",
    "we wish to express our thanks to the mcdonald telescope allocation committee for their granting of three nights of 2.1-meter telescope time .",
    "we are also grateful to dr .",
    "chris johns - krull for his reductions of the mcdonald data to echellogram format .",

    "<S> a comparison of hei @xmath05875 and @xmath06678 line profiles during the peak of the infall activity suggests that differences in the development of the blue wing at this time are due to heating and a short - lived formation of an optically thin layer above the region compressed by the infall . </S>",
    "<S> this discovery and the well - known decreases in equivalent widths of the cii doublet at the two shock phases leads us to suggest that shock heating flattens the atmospheric temperature gradient , whether it is the infall shock preferentially heating of the upper atmospheric layers from infall , or the pulsational wave shock , which takes on an isothermal character as it emerges into the more tenuous upper photosphere .    except for evidence of wind in the far blue wings of the uv resonance lines , we find no evidence for a shock delay arriving at different regions of line formation of the photosphere ( i.e. , a  van hoof effect ) . </S>",
    "<S> phase lags attributed by some former observers may be false indicators arising from varying degrees of desaturation of multiple lines , such as for the red hei lines . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , an apparent lag in the equivalent width curve of lines arising from less excited atomic levels could instead be caused by post - shock cooling , followed by a rebound shock , as suggested by subtle variations in the photospheric @xmath01640 and uv continuum flux curves .    </S>",
