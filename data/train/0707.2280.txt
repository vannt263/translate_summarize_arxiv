    "during the last decade , significant progress has been achieved in laser cooling of lanthanides ( rare - earth elements ) .",
    "laser - cooled lanthanides are effectively used in such fundamental fields as the study of cold collisions @xcite , bose - einstein condensation @xcite , ultra - precise atomic clocks @xcite and also open new perspectives for implementation in nano - technology @xcite and quantum information @xcite .",
    "in contrast to recently demonstrated method of buffer gas cooling and trapping of lanthanides in a magnetic dipole trap @xcite , laser - cooled atoms are easily manipulated by the help of light fields @xcite and can be studied in a nearly perturbation - free regime .",
    "compared to atoms from the alkali and the alkali - earth groups , spectra of lanthanides are significantly richer due to the presence of the 4f shell electrons .",
    "ytterbium with its closed 4f@xmath10 shell possesses the simplest level structure and has been successfully laser cooled at the wavelength of 398.9 nm ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in 2006",
    "cooling of atomic erbium was reported @xcite at the wavelength of 401 nm .",
    "both these strong cooling transitions are not completely closed and their upper levels also decay to the neighboring opposite - parity levels thus taking a part of population out from the cooling cycle ( optical leaks ) . in the case of erbium ( 4f@xmath116s@xmath12 ) ,",
    "evaluation of a leak rate is a complex task due to a rich level structure .",
    "still , it has been shown experimentally , that it is possible to cool and to trap up to @xmath13 erbium atoms in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) even without a repumper laser .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the possibility to cool atomic thulium which resides between er and yb in the periodic table .",
    "since there is only one unfilled electron in the 4f shell ( the ground state of tm has a configuration of @xmath14 ) , its electronic structure is more complex than that of yb , but still is one of the simplest among lanthanides .",
    "thulium has only one stable isotope @xmath0tm with a nuclear spin number of @xmath15 which results in a simple doublet hyperfine splitting of each electronic level .",
    "the monoisotopic structure should increase a mot loading rate , while the non - degenerate zeeman structure of the ground level enables sub - doppler cooling schemes .",
    "the ground state of @xmath0tm consists of two fine structure levels with total electronic momentum numbers of @xmath16 and @xmath17 which are separated by @xmath18hz ( the corresponding transition wavelength is @xmath19 m ) .",
    "the excited ground - state level with @xmath17 is metastable and one can expect its life time to be on the order of a few fractions of a second @xcite . due to",
    "the shielding by the outer closed 6s@xmath12 shell @xcite , it is expected that interrogation of these forbidden transitions even in dense laser - cooled atomic clouds will allow one to build precise optical atomic references possessing a high short - term stability .    in this paper",
    "we describe our experimental study of two candidates for cooling transitions from the ground state to the excited states @xmath2 at @xmath3 nm and @xmath4 at 420.4 nm ( section  ii ) .",
    "the hyperfine structure ( hfs ) of these levels are accurately determined from the experiment .",
    "simultaneously we have for the first time determined the hfs of two other excited levels which are within reach of our laser system . from the analysis of saturation absorption spectra",
    "we have experimentally determined lifetimes of the excited levels and compared them with existing data @xcite . with the relativistic hartree - fock code of cowan @xcite ,",
    "optical leak rates are quantitative evaluated .",
    "results of this analysis are presented in section  iii . in section",
    "iv we discuss realistic laser cooling schemes for thulium . in the last section",
    "we analyze the magnetic dipole transition at 1.14@xmath8 m with the help of the cowan code and also with the flexible atomic code ( fac ) of feng @xcite .",
    "to efficiently laser cool an atomic sample one has to choose a strong closed cycling transition which can be excited by a powerful laser source . in the case of thulium , we restrict our consideration to transitions from the ground state level @xmath20 to the excited levels of the opposite parity with @xmath21 . such a choice allows the use of cycling transitions between the hyperfine components of the lower and upper levels @xmath22 . in this case , electric dipole transitions from upper levels to other fine and hyperfine sublevels of the ground state will be forbidden by the selection rules .    among excited levels in tm",
    "one can select three candidates favorable for laser cooling @xcite : @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , which are schematically presented in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the green transition at @xmath29 nm can be excited by the second harmonic of a laser on gadolinium scandium gallium garnet activated by neodymium ( nd : gsgg ) @xcite . the transition is completely closed in the electric - dipole approximation which removes the problem of optical leaks .",
    "unfortunately , the low rate of @xmath30 prevents using this transition for efficient loading a mot from a thermal beam ( an atom with initial velocity of 200  m / s can be decelerated at a distance not shorter then 3  m ) .",
    "nevertheless it can be used after cooling an atomic sample at other strong transition .",
    "for example , such a blue and green mot sequence is implemented for cooling ytterbium to sub - mk temperatures @xcite .",
    "other transitions at 420.4 nm and 410.6 nm can be excited by the second harmonic of a titanium : sapphire ( ti : sa ) laser , the second harmonic of an infrared diode laser or directly by a nitride diode laser ( see e.g. @xcite ) . according to @xcite these transitions have rates of @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively which should be sufficient to decelerate hot atoms at a distance of a few tens of centimeters .",
    "the transitions are not completely closed .",
    "the upper levels are coupled to neighboring opposite - parity levels as shown in fig.[fig1 ] . to choose the best candidate for cooling transition it would be desirable to evaluate optical leak rates .",
    "the hyperfine structure of excited levels in thulium is measured by different methods and the following references summarize most of the available data @xcite . the level with the energy",
    "@xmath28 has been previously studied by the optogalvanic spectroscopy in the hollow cathode discharge @xcite and its hfs frequency has been determined .",
    "we use saturation absorption spectroscopy in counter - propagating beams of the same frequency to measure the hfs of the levels which can be excited from the ground state in the wavelength region 410420 nm .",
    "the experimental setup is presented in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "radiation of a ti : sa laser ( mbr-110 , coherent inc . ) is frequency doubled in a lithium triobate crystal ( lbo ) placed in an external cavity ( mbd-200 , coherent inc . ) .",
    "the laser system produces up to 150mw of radiation in the spectral region 400430 nm .",
    "the spectral line width of the ti : sa laser is specified as 100khz which is achieved by locking the laser to a stable high - finesse fabry - perot cavity .",
    "we tune the laser to the atomic transition with the help of a home - made wavemeter .",
    "the astigmatic blue laser beam is expanded to about @xmath33 ( at @xmath34 level ) and is split into saturation and probe beams .",
    "the beams are carefully aligned in the counter - propagating configuration with the angle between them less than @xmath35 .",
    "the probe beam is modulated by a wheel chopper at 850hz , and the signal from the probe beam is recorded using the lock - in technique by a computer .",
    "the beams have orthogonal linear polarizations ( lin@xmath36lin ) and are separated on a polarization beam splitter .",
    "intensities of the beams can be varied by absorptive neutral density filters .",
    "they are measured by a calibrated power meter at the cell entrance .",
    "the laser frequency detuning is controlled by a stable confocal interferometer with a free spectral range of 75mhz .",
    "frequency marks are recorded simultaneously with absorption spectra .",
    "thulium vapor is produced in a stainless steel oven of 20 mm in diameter .",
    "the central part can be heated by a coaxial cable to 1100k .",
    "current flowing through the central heating wire of the cable returns back through its outer shielding which significantly cancels out an induced magnetic field .",
    "external coils in helmholtz configuration allow compensation of the laboratory magnetic field to less then 1 g .",
    "the melting point of thulium is 1818k , but a vapor pressure of 10@xmath37 mbar can be reached already at about 1000k . to prevent heating of the whole cell , its central part is surrounded by water cooling coils .",
    "the cell is pumped out by 20l / s turbo - molecular pump .",
    "thulium chunks of a few hundred milligrams are placed in the central part of the oven . after heating to 1000k ,",
    "we observe the absorption of 50% in the center of the doppler - broadened line at 410.6 nm .",
    "the pipe can stably operate in this regime for days .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] presents saturation absorption spectra for the transitions at 410.6 nm and 420.4 nm . besides saturation absorption lines formed by atoms with zero velocity projection on the beam axis , we observe cross - over resonances of different signs .",
    "identification of hyperfine spectra is presented in the insets of fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the accurate result of @xmath38mhz for the hfs of the ground state @xmath39 measured by childs _",
    "@xcite is used to calibrate the the free spectral range of the fabry - perot cavity . here",
    "we will use negative frequencies for the hfs if the fermi energy is negative .    to determine the hyperfine structure frequency of the excited levels we fit the recorded spectra by a multi - peak lorentzian function and use the frequency ruler of the fabry - perot cavity .",
    "uncertainty of the measurement is the sum of the statistical uncertainty of 0.5mhz and the systematic contribution of 0.5mhz .",
    "the latter mainly results from the asymmetry of trasmission peaks of the fabry - perot cavity and is evaluated by measuring positions of the cross - over resonances .",
    "no dependence of the hfs frequencies on light intensity is observed .",
    "results of the measurement are presented in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that the hyperfine splitting of upper and lower levels of both candidates for cooling transitions are similar and differ for only a few tens of natural line widths .",
    "it can result in the situation , that a laser tuned to the red wing of the the cooling transition  1 ( fig.[fig3 ] ) will simultaneously transfer population from @xmath40 via the transition  3 . due to the relatively small detuning",
    ", the process will have a higher probability than the non - resonance population transfer to the @xmath40 level via @xmath41 one .",
    "laser cooling without repumping has been successfully demonstrated in erbium @xcite .",

    "we use the setup shown in fig.[fig2 ] to measure the natural line width of candidates for cooling transitions @xmath22 at 410.6 nm and 420.4 nm ( see insets in fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "being excited at these nearly closed cycling transitions , thulium behaves as a two - level system which allows us to neglect optical pumping and coherent effects @xcite .",
    "we performed a set of measurements varying saturation and probe power densities .",
    "the power of 1mw approximately corresponds to the on - axis power density of about 3mw / cm@xmath12 .",
    "results are presented in fig.[fig4 ] , where the measured line width @xmath53 is plotted against the excitation power @xmath54 .",
    "again , each recorded spectrum has been fitted by a multi - peak lorentzian function with independent fit parameters for each peak . in the case of a weak probe beam ,",
    "the line width @xmath53 is given by the following expression @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the natural line width and @xmath57 is an excitation power density .",
    "the saturation power density @xmath58 is defined as @xmath59 . in the general case",
    "the expression is more complex @xcite , but the relation @xmath60 remains valid .",
    "we fit the data presented in fig.[fig4 ] by the function ( [ eq1 ] ) , where @xmath56 and @xmath58 are taken as fit parameters .",
    "due to uncertainty in the power density measurement and inhomogeneous intensity profile we have to use the second fit parameter for @xmath58 .",
    "line widths extrapolated to zero intensity are @xmath61mhz for the transition @xmath22 at 410.6 nm and @xmath62mhz for the corresponding hyperfine transition at 420.4 nm .",
    "the inhomogeneous radial intensity distribution should modify the fit function in a complex way .",
    "but substitution of the fit function ( [ eq1 ] ) by a linear regression or by a function @xmath63 changes extrapolated values for less than 0.2mhz .",
    "we use this value as an uncertainty resulting from our unprecise knowledge of the fit function .",
    "derivation of true saturation intensity and @xmath56 from the second fit parameter is hindered by the complex radial intensity distribution in the laser beams .",
    "to evaluate the natural line widths of the transitions we correct the obtained results for systematic broadenings .",
    "the main contribution results from the laser line width which we evaluate as 0.2(2)mhz according to the manufacturers specification ( we doubled the line width of the ti : sa laser assuming that the main noise contribution results from slow long - term correlated acoustic vibrations @xcite ) . the next important broadening mechanism is the time - of - flight broadening which we evaluate as 0.1(1)mhz . the geometrical broadening resulting from the finite angle between the beams and pressure shift can be conservatively estimated as 10(10)khz and 50(50)khz respectively .",
    "the zeeman splitting of @xmath64-components in a residual magnetic field is small due to very similar magnetic @xmath65-factors of the lower and the upper levels .",
    "the splitting of @xmath66-components is about 1.5mhz / g . for magnetic fields lower than 1 g the zeeman splittings",
    "@xmath67 is relatively small ( @xmath68 ) and can be considered similar to inhomogeneous spectral line broadening .",
    "the following expression for the resulting line profile @xmath69 is valid @xmath70 which is similar to the case of voigt function , when the contribution of the doppler width is much less than of the lorentzian one .",
    "thus the zeeman broadening of the transitions can be evaluated as 0.1(2 )  mhz .",
    "taking all these contributions into account we finally get the natural line width of @xmath71mhz for the transition @xmath72 at 410.6 nm and 3.3(4)mhz for the transition @xmath73 at 420.4 nm . our results are in a good agreement with transition rates given in @xcite and are summarized in the next section in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "the candidates for cooling transitions at @xmath74 nm and @xmath75 nm are not perfectly closed .",
    "the excited levels @xmath76 and @xmath77 can decay via electric dipole transitions to 6 and 4 neighboring opposite - parity levels respectively as shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "a crucial parameter for a cooling transition is a branching ratio @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the decay rate to the ground state and @xmath80 ( @xmath81 for the 420.4 nm transition or @xmath82 for 410.6 nm one ) are decay rates via other dipole transitions . in the expression ( [ eq2 ] ) only the decay rate to the ground state can be taken from @xcite while all other values remain unknown .",
    "we evaluated the decay rates using the relativistic hartree - fock code of cowan @xcite .",
    "the excited states have mixed electronic configurations ( see @xcite ) , and we took into account a few leading configurations for each level . since it is difficult to achieve correct energies for all levels simultaneously , we performed two sets of calculations . in the fist",

    "we have analyzed the possibility to cool atomic thulium from the thermal beam at a temperature of 1100k using blue resonance light in a zeeman cooler . because of the relatively low transition rate and the significant rate of optical leaks",
    ", the transition at 420.4 nm looks unfavorable for laser cooling . indeed , to completely decelerate a thulium atom with the initial velocity of 200 m/s",
