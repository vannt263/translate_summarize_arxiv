    "quantum cryptography allows us to solve cryptographic tasks without resorting to unproven computational assumptions .",
    "one example is quantum key distribution ( qkd ) which is well - studied within quantum information @xcite . in qkd , the sender ( alice ) and the receiver ( bob ) trust each other , but want to shield their communication from the prying eyes of an eavesdropper . in many other cryptographic problems , however , alice and bob themselves do _ not _ trust each other , but nevertheless want to cooperate to solve a certain task .",
    "an important example of such a task is secure identification .",
    "here , alice wants to identify herself to bob ( possibly an atm machine ) without revealing her password .",
    "more generally , alice and bob wish to perform _ secure function evaluation _ as depicted in figure  [ fig : sfe ] .",
    "( e.g.  her password ) , and bob holds an input @xmath0 ( e.g.  the password an honest alice should possess ) , and they want to obtain the value of some function @xmath1 ( e.g.  the equality function ) . ]    in this scenario , security means that the legitimate users should not learn anything beyond this specification .",
    "that is , alice should not learn anything about @xmath0 and bob should not learn anything about @xmath2 , other than what they may be able to infer from the value of @xmath1 .",
    "classically , it is possible to solve this task if one is willing to make computational assumptions , such as that factoring of large integers is difficult . sadly ,",
    "these assumptions remain unproven .",
    "unfortunately , even quantum mechanics does not allow us to implement such interesting cryptographic primitives without further assumptions  .",
    "the noisy - storage model ( nsm ) allows us to obtain secure two - party protocols under the _ physical _ assumption that any cheating party does not posses a large reliable quantum storage .",
    "first introduced in  @xcite , the nsm has recently  @xcite been shown to encompass both the case where the adversary has a bounded amount of noise - free storage  @xcite ( also known as the bounded - storage model ) , as well as the case where the adversary has access to a potentially large amount of noisy storage .",
    "this last assumption is well justified given the state of present day technology , and the fact that merely transferring the state of a photonic qubit onto a different carrier ( such as an atomic ensemble ) is typically already noisy , even if the resulting quantum memory is perfect . in the protocols considered",
    ", the honest parties themselves do not require any quantum storage at all .",
    "we briefly review the nsm here for completeness . without loss of generality ,",
    "noisy quantum storage is described by a family of completely positive trace - preserving maps @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the time that the adversary uses his storage device .",
    "an input state @xmath5 on  @xmath6 stored at time  @xmath7 decoheres over time , resulting in a state @xmath8 of the memory at time  @xmath4 .",
    "we make the minimal assumption that the noise is markovian , meaning that the adversary does not gain any advantage by delaying the readout whenever he wants to retrieve encoded information : waiting longer only degrades the information further .",
    "the only assumption underlying the noisy - storage model consists in demanding that the adversary can only keep quantum information in this noisy storage device .",
    "in particular , he is otherwise completely unrestricted  for example , he can perform arbitrary ( instantaneous ) quantum computations using information from the storage device and additional ancillas . in particular , he is able to perform perfect , noise - free , quantum computation and communication .",
    "however , after his computation he needs to discard all quantum information except what is contained in the storage device , where he may prepare an arbitrary encoded state on  @xmath6 .",
    "this scenario is illustrated in figure  [ fig : noisystorage ] .",
    "how can we obtain security from such a physical assumption ?",
    "we consider protocols which force the adversary to store quantum information for extended periods to gain information : this is achieved by using certain time delays  @xmath9 at specific points in the protocol ( e.g. , before starting a round of communication ) .",
    "this forces the adversary to use his device for a time at least  @xmath9 if he wants to preserve quantum information .",
    "due to the markovian assumption , it suffices to analyze security for the channel @xmath10 .",
    "hence the security model can be summarized as follows :    * the adversary has unlimited classical storage , and ( quantum ) computational resources .",
    "he is able to perform any operations noise - free and has access to a noise - free quantum channel .",
    "* whenever the protocol requires the adversary to wait for a time @xmath9 , he has to measure / discard all his quantum information except what he can encode ( arbitrarily ) into @xmath6 .",
    "this information then undergoes noise described by  @xmath11 .",
    "we stress that in contrast to the adversary s potential resources allowed in this model , the technological demands on honest parties are minimal : in our protocol , honest parties merely need to prepare and measure bb84-encoded qubits   and do not require any quantum storage .    , the adversary must use his noisy - quantum storage described by the cptp map @xmath11 . before using his quantum storage",
    ", he performs any ( error - free ) `` encoding attack '' of his choosing , which consists of a measurement or an encoding into an error - correcting code .",
    "after time @xmath9 , he receives some additional information that he can use for decoding . ]      in this work we focus on how to put the protocols of  @xcite into practice .",
    "unfortunately , the theoretical analysis of  @xcite assumes perfect single - photon sources that are not available yet @xcite . here",
    ", we remove this assumption leading to a slightly modified protocol that can be implemented immediately using today s technology . at first glance",
    ", it may appear that the security analysis for a practical implementation differs little from the problems encountered in practical realizations of qkd .",
    "after all , the quantum communication part of the protocols in  @xcite consists of alice sending bb84 states to bob . yet , since now the legitimate users do not trust each other , the analysis differs from qkd in several fundamental aspects .",
    "intuitively , these differences arise because alice and bob do not cooperate to check on an outside eavesdropper .",
    "quite on the contrary , alice can never rely on anything that bob says . a second important aspect that differentiates the setting in  @xcite from qkd lies in the task the cryptographic protocols aim to solve .",
    "for instance , secure identification is particularly interesting at extremely short distances , for which alice would ideally use a small , low power , portable device .",
    "bob , on the other hand , may use more bulky detectors . at such short distances",
    ", we could furthermore use visible light for which much better detectors exist than those typically used in qkd at telecom wavelengths .",
    "it is an interesting experimental challenge to come up with suitable devices .",
    "small handheld setups have been proposed to perform qkd at short distance  @xcite , which we can also hope to use here .",
    "the qkd devices of  @xcite have been devised to distribute non - reusable authentication keys which could also be employed for identification . at such short distance ,",
    "this could also be achieved by for example loading keys onto a usb stick at a trusted loading station at a bank for instance .",
    "we emphasize that our work is in spirit very different in that we allow authentication keys to be reused over and over again , just as traditional passwords  @xcite .",
    "we first analyze a generic experimental setup in section  [ sec : abstractsource ] .",
    "more specifically , we present a source - independent characterization of such a setup and discuss all parameters that are necessary to evaluate security in the nsm .",
    "especially important is that in any real - world setting even the honest parties do not have access to perfect quantum operations , and the channel connecting alice and bob is usually noisy .",
    "the challenge we face is to enable the honest parties to execute the protocol successfully in the presence of errors , while ensuring that the protocol remains secure against any cheating party .",
    "we shall always assume a worst - case scenario where a cheating party is able to perform perfect quantum operations and does not experience channel noise , its only restriction is its noisy quantum storage .",
    "the primary source of errors at short distances lies in the low detector efficiencies of present day single - photon detectors . for telecom wavelengths",
    "these detector efficiencies @xmath12 lie at roughly @xmath13 , where at visible wavelengths one can use detectors of about @xmath14 efficiency .",
    "hence , a considerable part of the transmissions will be lost . in section  [ sec : wseerrors ] , we augment the protocol for weak string erasure presented in  @xcite to deal with such erasure errors . this protocol is the main ingredient to realize the primitive of oblivious transfer , which can be used to solve the problem of computing a function @xmath1 .",
    "the second source of errors lies in bit errors which result from noise on the channel itself or imperfections in alice and bob s measurement apparatus . at short distances",
    ", such errors will typically be quite small . in section  [ sec : otfromwsee ] , we show how to augment the protocol for oblivious transfer to deal with bit errors .",
    "it should be noted that we treat these errors in the classical communication part of the protocols , independently of erasure errors , and similar techniques may be used in other schemes based on weak string erasure in the future .    to obtain security",
    ", we have to make a reasonable estimation of the errors that the honest parties expect to occur .",
    "we state the necessary parameters in section  [ sec : abstractsource ] and provide concrete estimates for two experimental setups in section  [ sec : concretesource ] . in particular , we present explicit security parameters for a source of weak coherent pulses , and a parametric down conversion ( pdc ) source . throughout , we assume that the reader is familiar with commonly used entropic quantities also relevant for qkd , and quantum information .",
    "an introduction to all concepts relevant for security in the nsm is given in  @xcite .",
    "[ sec : parameters ]    before turning to the actual protocols , we need to investigate the parameters involved in an experimental setup . the quantum communication part of all the protocols in the nsm is a simple scheme for weak string erasure which we will describe in detail in the next section .",
    "in each round of this protocol , alice chooses one of the four possible bb84 states  @xcite at random and sends this state to bob .",
    "bob now measures randomly the state received either in the computational or in the hadamard basis .",
    "such a setup is characterized by a source held by alice , and a measurement apparatus held by bob as depicted in figure  [ fig : general ] .",
    "the source can as well include a measurement device , depending on the actual state preparation process ( e.g. when a pdc source acts as a triggered single - photon source ) .",
    "if alice is honest , we can trust the source entirely , which means that in principle we have full knowledge of its parameters .",
    "note , however , that in any practical setting the parameters of the source will undergo small fluctuations .",
    "for clarity of exposition , we do not take these fluctuations into account explicitly , but assume that all the parameters below are worst - case estimates of what we can reasonably expect from our source .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have access to a perfect single - photon source in a practical setting @xcite , but can only arrange the source to emit a certain number of photons with a certain probability . to approximate a single - photon source , we will later let alice perform some measurements herself to exclude multi - photon events in the case of a pdc source .",
    "the following table summarizes the two relevant probabilities we need to know in any implementation . when using decoy states , we will frequently add an index @xmath15 to all parameters to specify a particular source @xmath15 that is used .

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we now investigate the security of @xmath16-weak string erasure , when using a pdc source . for easy comparison",
    ", we will consider exactly the same plots as before , where however we sometimes choose a different value for the mean photon number which seemed more useful for this source .",
    "for simplicity , we will also consider a setting where we give all the information encoded in multi - photons to dishonest bob for free , _",
    "i.e. _ , we consider @xmath17 , which clearly overestimates his capabilities as we see in claim  [ lem : comparison ] .",
    "again , we first consider when security can be obtained in principle ( i.e. , when   and   are satisfied ) as a function of the mean photon number @xmath18 , the detection efficiency @xmath19 , the storage rate @xmath20 and the amount of storage noise , where our examples here focus on the depolarizing channel with parameter @xmath21 as defined in  .",
    "figure  [ fig : pdccond1numu ] thereby tells us again when security is possible at all , independently of the amount of storage noise . as before ,",
    "we then examine a particular example of storage noise and storage rates in figure  [ mm4 ] , that even for low storage noise , we can hope to achieve security for many source settings .     in the upper enclosed regions for a low storage noise of @xmath22 and storage rates @xmath23 ( dashed red line ) , @xmath24 ( dotted green line ) , @xmath25 ( dot dashed blue line ) , @xmath26 ( large dashed magenta line ) , @xmath27 ( solid black line ) .",

    "[ fig : pdcrateplot ]",
    "we have shown that security in the noisy - storage model  @xcite can in principle be obtained in a practical setting , and provided explicit security parameters for two possible experimental setups .",
    "our analysis shows that the protocols of  @xcite are well within reach of today s technology .",
    "we have been mostly focusing our attention on short - distance ( in the order of a few meters ) applications .",
    "for this range , it is an interesting experimental challenge to construct small handheld devices which can be used to implement these protocols . nonetheless , in the future it might be interesting to study the curve between the rate and the distance of secure wsee ( in a similar way as the key rate versus distance curve in qkd ) .",
    "such a curve will allow us to see if our protocols can be applied in a local area network ( lan ) or metropolitan area network ( man ) .",
    "note that for medium - distance ( say order 10 km ) applications , our protocol may still work .",
    "for instance , standard telecom fiber has a channel loss of about 0.2db / km at telecom wavelength ( i.e. 1550 nm ) so , 10 km translates to only 2db channel loss , which seems quite manageable !    many important theoretical ( see  @xcite ) as well as practical issues remain to be addressed . as in quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , we have assumed that all experimental components behave as we expect them to .",
    "hence , we have not considered any practical attacks such as exploiting detectors that are blind above a certain threshold  @xcite , which is outside the scope of this work .",
    "most importantly however , it is certaintly possible to improve the parameters obtained here . these improvements can come from theoretical advances  @xcite , as well as an exact optimization of all parameters for a particular experimental setup .",
    "furthermore , in the case of parametric down conversion , for example , we have not made use of the fact that bob can not gain full information from multi - photon emissions , which leads to an increase in rates .",
    "similarly , when using decoy states , one could make use of pulses emitted using a decoy setting in the protocol .",
    "this requires a careful analysis of weak string erasure for different photon sources analogous to the one presented in the appendix .",
    "nevertheless , we hope that this analysis paves the way for a practical implementation of protocols in the noisy - storage model .",

    "in the limit of large @xmath44 , we expect roughly @xmath94 single - photon rounds .",
    "however , since bob may choose to report single - photon rounds as missing , we have to analyze how many rounds still contribute to our security analysis . the analysis of  @xcite links the security to the rate at which bob has to send classical information through his noisy storage channel . in order to determine this rate , we first investigate the setting where he is not allowed to keep any quantum state .",
    "let @xmath95 denote the substring of @xmath96 that corresponds to single - photon emissions . in  @xcite the rate at which bob needs to send information through his noisy - storage channel depends on an uncertainty relation using post - measurement information .",

    "we are thus interested in the min - entropy @xmath98 where we use @xmath99 and @xmath100 to denote bob s classical information and the basis information corresponding to the single - photon rounds respectively and @xmath101 is the probability that bob guesses the string @xmath95 maximized over all choices of measurements anticipating his post - measurement information @xmath100  @xcite .",
