    "clusters of galaxies are widely believed to grow up with repetition of small - scale cluster merging .",
    "gravitational energy released in the merger process heats up intracluster plasma , and accelerates particles up to higher energy .",
    "actually , in many clusters , diffuse synchrotron radiation from high energy electrons is detected by radio observations ( e.g. , a2163 : feretti et al .",
    "in addition , a sign of the hard x - ray emission , that is thought to be inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of the cosmic microwave background by accelerated electrons , has been reported for some clusters ( e.g. , coma cluster : fusco - femiano et al .",
    "moreover , large temperature fluctuations are often found in clusters which are candidates of non - thermal hard x - ray emitters .",
    "recent x - ray studies have reported that very hot plasma , whose temperature exceeds @xmath1 kev , exists in some merging clusters , such as rx j1347.5 - 1145 ( ota et al , 2008 ) and a 3667 ( nakazawa et al , 2009 ) . as above , plasma heating and particle acceleration in clusters are inseparably connected phenomena .",
    "therefore , search for these phenomena is important to understand the history of cluster evolution , especially for the physical mechanisms of plasma heating and energy transportation .    in this paper",
    ", we report on a study of the large - scale temperature structure of the perseus cluster ( abell 426 ) .",
    "the perseus cluster is a nearby ( z = 0.0183 ) , massive , largely extended cluster , and is the most luminous cluster in the x - ray band . an x - ray bright active galaxy ngc 1275 , with a radio mini - halo ,",
    "is located at the cluster center , and non - thermal power - law emission from ngc 1275 was confirmed by past observations ( e.g. , sanders et al , 2005 ) .",
    "asca found a large fluctuation of temperature in this cluster , and indicated that a very hot region with the temperature exceeding @xmath2 kev exists in the outer region .",
    "information on cluster merging should remain in the low - density outer rather than the dense central region .",
    "therefore , it is very valuable to investigate the temperature structure and non - thermal emission in the outer region of the cluster carefully .",
    "determination of the temperature @xmath3 of hot regions with @xmath4 kev is difficult for detectors , whose energy band is limited below 10 kev ( e.g. asca and xmm - newton ) .",
    "therefore , we should observe clusters with a detector , that is sensitive above 10 kev , so as to determine the temperature by covering the spectral roll - off of thermal emission .",
    "therefore , we observed 30 offset regions from the perseus cluster center , with the hxd - pin / xis onboard suzaku .",
    "hxd - pin is a non - imaging detector of 64 pin diodes , covering the hard x - ray band of 10 - 60 kev , and able to perform observations with a low background level and a small field of view ( fov ) of 34@xmath534 ( fwhm ) .",
    "a narrow field of view has advantage of reducing the contribution of the bright central region to the observed spectra .",
    "the xis is a focal plane ccd detector with an x - ray telescope ( xrt ) , covering the soft x - ray band of 0.2 - 10 kev with an fov of 18@xmath518. combination of the xis and hxd - pin gives a broad band x - ray spectrum and thus we can determine the temperature structure of hot clusters . throughout this paper , we adopt a hubble constant of h@xmath6 = 50 h@xmath7 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 .",
    "all statistical errors are given at 90% confidence level .",
    "we observed the outer regions of the perseus cluster on september 2 - 4 , 2006 , with suzaku .",
    "four pointing observations of 30 offset regions from the cluster center were carried out .",
    "these observations make use of a narrow fov of the pin , by reducing the contribution of intense emission from the cluster center .",
    "additionally , we also analyzed the suzaku public data of observations of the perseus cluster center , on february 12 , 2006 , august 29  september 2 , 2006 , and february 56 , 2007 .",

    "error bars in the figure present the 90% confidence level , though systematic errors due to the nxb uncertainty of the hxd - pin are not shown here .",
    "distinct features of the temperature structure are a steep decline toward the center and a relatively flat profile in the outer region .",
    "xis results in the offset regions give a lower temperature than the pin analysis .",
    "this is possibly because the xis is sensitive to a lower temperature component , if two different temperature ( hot and cool ) components exists at different regions along the same line of sight .",
    "therefore , the results of the xis and the pin do not necessarily conflict with each other .",
    "most importantly , we found that the upper limit of the temperature of the offset region , where hot components seem to exist , is at most 14 kev ( @xmath18 19 kev within the systematic errors ) . considering that the xis spectra do not require the hot component",
    ", it seems that very hot gas as reported in rxj 1347.5 - 1145 ( ota et al .",
    "2008 ) or a 3667 ( nakazawa et al . 2009 ) does not exist in the perseus cluster . in this analysis",
    ", we could not study temperature fluctuations due to the low data statistics of the offset observations .",
    "but the average temperature in each offset region is not inconsistent with the results of asca ( furusho et al . 2001 ) .",
    "temperature structure with a negative gradient towards the center and a roughly flat external plateau is typical for cooling flow type clusters ( pointecouteau et al . 2005 ) . these clusters , showing a strong cooling core ,",
    "are thought to be gravitationally relaxed .",
    "actually , most colliding - type clusters do not show such a cooling core .",
    "therefore , we infer that the main body of the perseus cluster has been already relaxed , and has not recently experienced a violent cluster merger , which greatly influences the temperature structure of the cluster . on the other hand , rosat and",
    "other x - ray observatories found an excess of the surface brightness at 20 east from the cluster center ( ettori et al .",
    "moreover , asca found a temperature drop at the corresponding region ( furusho et al .",
    "therefore , it is implied that a small - scale substructure , such as a small galaxy cluster or group with cool gas , is currently colliding with the main body of the perseus cluster .",
    "we consider two reasons why extremely hot gas does not exist in the perseus cluster , even though some evidences of the cluster merger were found as described above .",
    "the first reason is that the present merging is in the latest phase , that is , extremely hot gas heated in the long past has already cooled down .",
    "the second reason is that heating condition is not satisfied in the current merging . in the case of rxj 1347.5 - 1145 ( ota et al .",
    "2008 ) , though it depends on various cluster parameters , extremely hot gas seems to take approximately 0.5 @xmath5 10@xmath19 yrs to cool down by radiation . on the other hand ,",
    "the cold substructure in the perseus cluster must have been created in recent 10@xmath19 yr , considering the diffusion time of the icm ( furusho et al . 2001 ) , and this is roughly comparable to the cooling time of extremely hot gas .",
    "accordingly , the picture that only the extremely hot gas cooled down without diffusion of the cold gas is not natural",
    ". therefore , the first reason , that a violent cluster merger occurred in the long past and extremely hot gas has already cooled down , is unlikely .",
    "hence , the second reason is preferred . according to kitayama et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and ota et al .",
    "( 2008 ) with help of takizawa ( 1999 ) , a high velocity ( @xmath20 4500 km s@xmath8 ) collision of two massive ( 5 @xmath5 10@xmath21 m@xmath22 ) clusters is needed to heat the icm up to 20 kev or higher for rxj 1347.5 - 1145 . in the case of the perseus cluster , the total mass , including the cold substructure , is 1.2 @xmath5 10@xmath23m@xmath22 , according to ettori et al .",
    "however , the mass of the subcluster is much less than the total mass , probably by one or two orders of magnitude .",
    "then , it may be difficult to heat up the icm to a high temperature , if the mass difference of two merging clusters is very large . actually , according to takizawa et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , two - cluster merging , with a mass ratio of 4 , could heat up the icm to at most @xmath0 13 kev .",
    "therefore , it is inferred that the current perseus cluster is already grown up enough , and not in a violent merger phase . though it is just speculation , a history of the cluster formation",
    "may be divided into two phases . in the early phase , clusters or groups with almost the same mass repeat violent mergers and",
    "grow up . in the latest phase , a grown - up large cluster cannibalizes small - scale galaxies clusters or groups .",
    "therefore , comparison between the spatial distribution of merging clusters and relaxed clusters is interesting to understand the evolution of the galaxy clusters and the large - scale structure of the universe .      in our analysis",
    ", we obtained the upper limit flux of the non - thermal emission as 4.4 @xmath5 10@xmath24 erg @xmath25 s @xmath8 ( 15 - 50 kev ) at the cluster offset region .",
    "so far , the perseus cluster has been often observed by x - ray satellites , such as asca , xmm - newton , chandra , swift / bat ( ajello et al . 2009 ) and so on .",
    "however the non - thermal emission from the cluster itself has not been discussed well , because the thermal emission from the cluster core is very bright and furthermore the agn emission from ngc 1275 must be considered . in this paper , we performed observations of cluster offset regions , by reducing the bright emission from the cluster center . in addition , we considered the contribution of the agn emission from ngc 1275 .",
    "therefore , this may be the first robust result of an upper limit of non - thermal emission from the perseus cluster .",
    "assuming the distance to the perseus cluster to be 75 mpc , the corresponding upper limit luminosity is 3.0 @xmath5 10@xmath26 erg s@xmath8 .",
    "this limit is tighter than those of other clusters observed with suzaku hxd - pin , such as a 3376 ( kawano et al .",
    "2009 ) and a3667 ( nakazawa et al . 2009 ) , owing to the proximity of the perseus cluster . considering no report of radio detection of the largely extended synchrotron emission like coma cluster , there is yet no evidence of particle acceleration in the perseus cluster .",
    "this result also supports that the perseus cluster is not in a violent cluster merger phase , as inferred from the icm temperature studies .",
