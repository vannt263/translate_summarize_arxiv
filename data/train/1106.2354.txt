    "on of the alfred gray s favorite tools was the solution to bjrling s problem : _ given a planar analytic curve , find a minimal surface in @xmath0 that contains it as a geodesic_. the weierstrass representation provides an explicit solution : if @xmath1 is a parameterization of the curve , the parameterization @xmath2 gives the solution , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 are extensions of @xmath5 , @xmath6 to functions of a complex variable @xmath7",
    ". we will call it the bjrling surface of the curve . when one takes , instead of the real part , the imaginary part of the expression , one gets another minimal surface , known as the conjugated surface of the first one .",
    "it is well know how alfred used this to produce many beautiful surfaces .",
    "but he could use it also as a theoretical tool : one day we asked alfred what order of contact could a minimal surface have at a self - intersection point ; without a second of thought he replied : `` any order of contact : take a planar curve with a self - contact of order @xmath8 and solve bjrling s problem '' .",
    "an instant theorem!.    formula ( [ eqn : bjor ] ) can be directly given to the computer .",
    "however , the fact that the integrand is in many cases multivaluated poses some problems when we try to get the global picture .",
    "take , for instance , the parabola @xmath9 .",
    "the formula gives the following parameterization of its bjrling surface @xmath10 which the reader can immediately give to his favorite graphics package  and get the wrong picture !",
    "( figure 1a , where the thick line shows the parabola ) .",
    "the problem has to do with the integrand that is multivalued and branches at the points @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "when we integrate from 0 to , say , @xmath13 along differents paths we can get different values , all with the same imaginary part .",
    "this produces a sharp edge , which is impossible in a minimal surface .",
    "the problem is more evident in the conjugate surface : we get a discontinuity which the computer fills with a planar face ( figure 1b ) .",
    "the problem can be easily solved by a simple sustitution @xmath14 which makes the function single valued and the surface becomes : @xmath15 which gives the correct picture ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the surface continues beyond the sharp edges which becomes lines of self - intersection and then takes a turn , giving a periodic pattern .",
    "the surface turns out to be the well - know catalan s surface that contains a cycloid perpendicular to the parabola which is another planar geodesic of the surface .",
    "figure 2b shows the correct conjugate surface .",
    "the above relation shows an interesting relation between the parabola and the cycloid : they have the same bjrling surface .",
    "recall that a plane cuts a minimal surface along a geodesic , if and only if , it is a plane of symmetry of the surface .",
    "now , the bjrling surface of a curve that has a line of symmetry has to planes of symmetry : the original one containing the curve and the plane perpendicular to it that contains the line of symmetry . in formula",
    "( ? ) the original curve is obtained by restricting to real values of @xmath7 and the orthogonal geodesic by restricting to purely imaginary values of @xmath7 .",
    "the two curves are in a sense , dual to each other . to be more precise : the duality is between objects consisting each of a curve and a point of intersection of the curve with a line of symmetry . we can call those pairs _ bjrling duals _ to each other . for example , the circle and the catenary are bjrling duals ( the common surface is the catenoid ) and so are the parabola and the cycloid with its line of symmetry that cuts t on one of the highest ( smooth ) points of the cycle .",
    "let us apply ( 1 ) to the ellipse with semi - axes @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xmath18 , and excentricity @xmath19 .",
    "we obtain @xmath20 and with it the computer produces figure 3 .",
    "one observes that this surface has various _ channels _ where one of the principal curvatures is close to zero and the other one is very big .",
    "again , this can not be a minimal surface !",
    "( one obtains a channel or an edge depending on the parity of the size of the grid used to plot the surface ) .",
    "the conjugate surface presents again a discontinuity which if filled by the computer with a flat face ( figure 3b )    alfred s depiction in @xcite of these surfaces , called by him _ elliptical catenoid _ and _ elliptical hellicoid _ , have the same problems .",
    "( those two loves of his , the computer and the bjrling problem , did not get togheter as smoothly as he thought ) . both maple ( which we use ) and mathematica give the same picture .",
    "maybe alfred was aware of the problem since in this case he used an elliptic function instead of applying directly the formula .",
    "the analysis must , however , be carried some steps further :    we use jacobi s elliptic functions ( for details , see @xcite , @xcite ) : jacobi s elliptic sine function @xmath21 , being the inverse function of the integral @xmath22 jacobi s elliptic cosine @xmath23 and jacobi s _ delta _ function @xmath24 like the trigonometric funtions ( which we obtain as the particular case @xmath25 ) they can be extended to complex functions , but the extensions are now meromorphic and doubly periodic instead of being holomorphic and periodic .",
    "the integrand is still a meromirphic function , but its residues are all @xmath29 @xcite , so the integral is a well - defined function of @xmath26 .",
    "this parameterization produces the correct picture of the elliptical catenoid .",
    "the ellipse has two lines of symmetry and , correspondly , two bjrling duals : one resembles a cycloid , the other one a catenary .",
    "figure 4 shows the correct pictures of the elliptical catenoid and the elliptical hellicoid :        99 a. gray , _ modern differential geometry of curves and surfaces _ , crc press , 2nd edition , 1998 .",
