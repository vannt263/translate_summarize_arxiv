    "various types of detectors require algorithms that handle number of datapoints in a plane and reconstruct the parameters of a circle , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "these algorithms need to be robust against noise hits and analyse big amount of data relatively fast .",
    "finally , the performance of the algorithm needs as independent as possible with the resolution of the detector .    in a recent paper @xcite we examined the use of the legendre transform for the determination of a circle s characteristics . in this paper",
    "we revisit this problem and describe in detail an alternative method , based on gaussian sums , proposed for the reconstruction of the circle s center @xmath0 and radius @xmath1 from a given set of datapoints .",
    "following the notation and train of though of @xcite , using @xmath2 datapoints ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , we can have a first estimation of the center @xmath6 and the radius , @xmath7 , of the circle ( see figure [ fig : circle_circle ] ) .     and radius @xmath7 . ]",
    "these estimates are given by :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10 the slopes of the lines connecting @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "having @xmath13 given datapoints / measurements , @xmath14 different centers and radii can be estimated . using the formulas described above the global sums",
    "are constructed    @xmath15    where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the circle s parameters for the @xmath19 triplet of datapoints that defines the circle .",
    "the standard deviations of the gaussians are set of a fraction of the geometrical scale of the problem . in the studies below @xmath20",
    "have been used .",
    "the reason of using gaussian functions in the definition of the global sums ( see above ) instead of using the basic @xmath21 test functions , is based on the fact that noise type datapoints will give values of the parameters far away from the right answer . these estimated parameters ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) will contribute very little to the global sums . on the contrary",
    ", the right values of the estimated parameters will give the maximum contribution .",
    "for each event the functions described above ( see figure [ fig : gaussians_sum_example ] ) are constructed and the value of the bin with the maximum number of entries is chosen .",
    "the value of these bins are the estimate of the @xmath22 and @xmath7 of the circle .",
    "the extraction of the circle parameters using the first method ( see section [ sec : model_description_first ] ) is straightforward : the bin with the maximum number of entries per event in each @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 gives the estimate of the center s coordinates and the radius of the circle .",
    "an example event can be seen in figure [ fig : gaussians_sum_example ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : one_circle ] the circle used to generate the datapoints is shown .",
    "the @xmath25 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 distributions for the circle parameters can be seen in figures [ fig : one_circle_r_gauss ] , [ fig : one_circle_x_gauss ] and [ fig : one_circle_y_gauss ] respectively . @xmath23 and @xmath24 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 peak at @xmath28 where the center of the circle is and @xmath25 peaks at @xmath29 indicating the actual radius of the circle .",
    "the algorithm is tested using simulated experiments , creating datapoints ( @xmath30 ) that belong to a circle .",
    "the robustness of the algorithms was tested by inserting gaussian uncertainties in both the @xmath31 and @xmath32 coordinates of the datapoints / measurements and random noise hits / outliers .",
    "a special scenario was considered , where one quadrant of the detector was deactivated ( results are summarized in table [ tab : results_no_quad ] ) .",
    "the center of the circle was chosen to be at @xmath33 with a radius of @xmath34 ( arbitrary units ) . using this circle ,",
    "@xmath13 datapoints ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) are randomly created .",
    "we smear both the @xmath37 and @xmath38 positions of the datapoints , independently on @xmath31 and @xmath32 , by @xmath39 , @xmath40 or @xmath41 of the circle s radius @xmath1 .",
    "apart from the uncertainty introduced in the position of the datapoints , noise hits in certain percentage of the datapoints that originate from the circle are included .",
    "the noise hits are randomly generated in the ranges @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "an event generated by this toy mc can be seen in figure [ fig : one_circle ] .",
    "the red and green datapoints ( @xmath44 ) are generated from the circle and the black datapoints are the noise hits ( @xmath45 noise level is used in this event ) .",
    "the positions of all the generated datapoints @xmath46 are smeared by @xmath40 of its radius @xmath1 .",
    "the results of the methods described in section [ sec : model_description ] are summarized in table [ tab : results ] .",
    "the algorithm proposed for the extraction of the circle s parameters work well under all test scenarios .",
    ".results of the algorithms described in section [ sec : sub_extracion ] .",
    "we use @xmath47 datapoints , generated in three quadrants of the circle , three different percentages of position uncertainty ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 of the radius @xmath1 ) and five additional noise hits .",
