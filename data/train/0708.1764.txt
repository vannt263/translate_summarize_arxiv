    "traditionally , brown dwarfs ( bds ) are defined as ( sub)stellar bodies with masses below the hydrogen burning mass limit ( hbl ) , @xmath0 for solar composition , and consequently they cool indefinitely after formation @xcite .",
    "several attempts have been made to explain the formation of bds by the same mechanisms as for stars , i.e. via fragmentation of a gas cloud and subsequent accretion @xcite .",
    "if a gas cloud in a star - forming region fragments there will be a certain number of gas clumps with masses below the hbl . unless the mass of the fragment is below the local jeans mass it will contract in essentially the same way as higher mass clumps and finally produce a single or multiple bd .",
    "this scenario predicts similar multiplicities and also a substellar initial mass function ( imf ) as a continuous extension of the stellar one ( e.g. the standard model with bds in @xcite ) .",
    "however , recent observations have shown that there is a lack of bd companions to low - mass stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a star - bd binary fraction among solar - type primaries of less than 1  for close companions , the _ brown dwarf desert_. this implies two populations of stellar and substellar objects , and that binaries are formed in each population separately ( except for pairing due to post - formation dynamical exchanges ) .",
    "observations e.g. by @xcite also show that most bd binaries have a primary - to - companion mass ratio of @xmath1 , in contrast to the mass ratio distribution of stellar binaries which has typically @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "there are indications , e.g. @xcite , that the bd desert may not be as dry for larger separations ( @xmath3  au ) as it is for smaller ones .",
    "since new surveys using adaptive optics or new instruments like the upcoming james webb space telescope might reveal more substellar companions to stars , the fraction of star - bd systems may increase .",
    "apart from the bd desert there are more hints for a separate population .",
    "for example , bds and vlmss have a relatively low binary fraction of about 15(@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . by comparison ,",
    "the stellar binary fraction is close to 100  for the very young taurus - auriga association ( ta , about 1  myr ; @xcite ) and about 4050  for other clusters and field stars @xcite .",
    "the bd and vlms binary fraction can be increased to a starlike binary fraction if there are a large fraction of @xmath4  au binaries , e.g. as deduced by @xcite .",
    "but such a semi - major axis distribution would again imply a discontinuity of its form between low - mass stars and vlmss / bds and is not supported by the radial - velocity survey of @xcite .",
    "we therefore do not consider the starlike formation as a major mechanism for bds .",
    "it has also been argued that the low binary fraction of bds can be understood as a continuous extension of a trend that can already be recognized from g dwarfs to m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "therefore , the binary fraction alone can not be taken as a strong evidence to introduce a separate population .",
    "the most striking evidence for two separate populations is the empirical fact that the distribution of the separations and therefore the binding energies of bd binaries differs significantly from that in the stellar regime @xcite .",
    "this is shown in figures [ sepdist ] and [ edist ] .",
    "the solid line is a gaussian fit to the central peak of the histogram while the dash - dotted one refers to ( @xcite , a compressed @xcite fit ) .",
    "bds and very low - mass stars ( vlms ) have a semi - major axis distribution limited to  au , whereas m , k , and g dwarfs have a very broad and similar distribution ( _ long - dashed and short - dashed curves _ ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there is also a dearth of bds below 1  au .",
    "recent findings , e.g. by @xcite and @xcite , suggest a low number of such very close bd / vlmss binaries .",
    "the semi - major axis distribution of bds / vlmss binaries based on the data from @xcite can be modelled with a log  @xmath5 gaussian centered at 4.6  au ( @xmath6 ) with a half - peak width of @xmath7 .",
    "it corresponds to an overall bd / vlms binary fraction of @xmath8 .",
    "if data from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite are taken as hints to incomplete data between about 0.02 and 1  au , the compressed @xcite gaussian from figure 4 in @xcite may provide an appropriate envelope .",
    "however , for an assumed bd mass of 0.07  and @xmath9 their period distribution corresponds to a semi - major axis distribution with @xmath10 and is therefore still inconsistent with that of m and g dwarfs .",
    "although @xcite have recently found five vlms binaries in ta with four of them having separations much larger than 15  au , the sudden change of the orbital properties remains .",
    "in particular , they found two binaries with projected separations slightly above 30  au and two others with separations between 80 and 90  au .",
    "possible implications of these discoveries are discussed in ",
    "[ ssec : diskfrag ] .",
    "however , the truncation near 15  au can not be derived from the stellar distribution through downsizing according to newton s laws @xcite .",
    "not even dynamical encounters in dense stellar environments can invoke such a truncation near 15  au @xcite .",
    "using @xmath11-body simulations @xcite tested the hypothesis that bds and stars form alike , and mix in pairs , and found that , despite of close dynamical encounters , the distribution of the semimajor axes of bd binaries remains starlike .",
    "that is , dynamical encounters even in dense clusters can not truncate the bd binary distribution near 15  au .",
    "they further found that star - bd binaries would be much more frequent than actually observed .",
    "thus , this classical hypothesis is rejected with high confidence .    with this contribution we study the implications of the observed change of binary properties on the underlying single - object initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "for this purpose , we analyzed the observational mass functions of ta ( luhman et al .",
    "2003a , 2004b ) , the ic  348 cluster @xcite , the trapezium cluster @xcite , and the pleiades cluster based on data by @xcite , @xcite , and the prosser and stauffer open cluster database .",
    "for all the systems we analyst , we refer to the mf as the imf , although strictly speaking this is not correct for the 130  myr old pleiades . in   [ sec : imf ] we shortly review the definition of the imf and the role of multiplicity on the shape of the individual body imf compared to the observed system imf ( ) . we show that the imf that can be derived from an observed  does not need to be continuous even if the  does not show any discontinuity . in ",
    "[ sec : method ] we describe the statistical method how to fit a model  by combining bd and star imfs as an approximation to the observed .",
    "  [ sec : results ] presents the results that indicate a discontinuity close to the hbl .",
    "also the bd to star ratio from the model is calculated there . in   [",
    "sec : discussion ] the results are discussed in the context of four alternative bd formation scenarios , i.e. embryo ejection , disk fragmentation , photoevaporation , and ejection by close stellar encounters .",
    "the imf is among the most important properties of a stellar population since it gives hints to the processes that form stars and bds .",
    "although we can only observe stellar populations at their given age there are data of several very young populations where the mass function is probably still very close to the initial one .",
    "in general , the mass distribution of stars and bds can be approximated by a power law or a combination of several power laws .",
    "@xcite estimated the relationship between the stellar mass and the relative number of stars of a given mass as a single power law , @xmath12 for @xmath13 and with @xmath14 and a normalization constant @xmath15 .",
    "the imf is often expressed on the logarithmic mass scale and then becomes @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the corresponding normalization constant for @xmath18 .",
    "an imf is said to be _ flat _ if @xmath19 is constant , i.e. @xmath20 .",
    "more recent work has shown there to be a flattening in the lower - mass regime of the observed mass function and , in the @xmath18 representation , even a turnover near the bd - star transition @xcite . here , all objects from bds to the most massive stars in a cluster are described by a _ continuous imf _ ,",
    "i.e. with a single population containing bds as well as stars . the universal or `` canonical '' imf has @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) , where @xmath27 is given by the mass of the host cluster @xcite .",
    "the generally accepted wisdom has been that the imf is continuous from above 0.01  to @xmath27 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "star cluster surveys are usually performed with wide - field telescopes with limited resolution that do not resolve most of the binaries .",
    "hence , they yield , as an approximation , system mfs in which unresolved binary systems are counted as one object . the fraction of unresolved multiples can be taken as the total binary fraction of a cluster , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the number of singles ( or resolved individual bodies ) and @xmath30 the number of ( unresolved ) binaries .",
    "unresolved binaries increase the number of individual bodies , @xmath31 , in a cluster such that @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the total number of systems .",
    "note that a `` system '' is either a single body or a binary or a higher order multiple . here",
    "we ignore higher order multiples , because they are rare @xcite .",
    "the binary fraction in dependence of the mass of the primary star , @xmath34 , is @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are , respectively ,",
    "the number of binaries with primary star mass @xmath34 and single stars of mass @xmath34 .      the effect of this _ binary error _ on the appearance of the imf can be described as follows .",
    "assume a stellar population with @xmath38 and with stellar masses with a minimum mass @xmath39 and a maximum mass limit of @xmath27 .",
    "the minimum mass of a binary is @xmath40 , while the mass - dependent binary fraction @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "a binary closely above @xmath40 can only consist of two stars near @xmath39 making such binaries rare .",
    "for higher system masses , where a system can be a multiple or a single star , there are more possible combinations of primary and companion mass , so that the binary fraction increases with the system mass and approaches an upper limit for the most massive objects .",
    "figure [ bincorr ] shows the general shape of a system imf for a flat ( logarithmic scale ) imf with @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the  is flat between @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( @xmath46 ) and rises above @xmath40 to a maximum at @xmath27 .",
    "systems with @xmath47 can only be singles and the  in this region is just the imf minus the mass function of objects that are bound to a multiple system . for masses",
    "@xmath48 , on the other hand , only binaries exist , and the  declines towards zero at @xmath49 , the highest mass possible for binaries .",
    "the sharp truncation of the imf at @xmath50 causes the sudden drop at @xmath51 , while the minor peak at @xmath52 corresponds to the maximum of the _ binary mass function _",
    "( , the imf of binary system masses ) . for a binary of this mass the primary and companion mass can be drawn from the whole imf , and thus the number of possible combinations becomes maximal .",
    "it should be noted that natural distributions with smoother boundaries probably do not show such a double peak .",
    "mathematically and in the case of random pairing , which is a reasonable approximation in the stellar regime @xcite , the binary mass function is just the integral of the product of the normalized imf , @xmath53 , of each component times the total number of binaries @xmath30 . given the masses of the binary components a and b , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the binary mass .",
    "thus ,  can now be written as @xmath56 where @xmath39 is the lower mass limit of all individual bodies in the population .",
    "the upper limit of the integral , @xmath57 , is the maximum mass of the primary component @xmath54 corresponding to a secondary component with @xmath58 .    the other extreme case of assigning the component masses is equal - mass pairing . in that case ,",
    "equation ( [ defbmf ] ) simplifies to the imf of one of the components and  is just the imf shifted by a factor of 2 in mass and corrected for binarity using equations ( [ ftot ] ) and ( [ defnbod ] ) : @xmath59 this case is more applicable for bd binaries since their mass ratio distribution peaks at a ratio @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "however , due to the low overall binary fraction of bds the effect of the mass ratio distribution is quite small .",
    "the  is just the sum of  and the imf of the remaining single objects , @xmath61 : @xmath62    thus , to obtain the true individual star imf , @xmath63 has to be extracted from the observed @xmath64 for which a model for @xmath65 is required .",
    "that is  has to be corrected for unresolved binaries in the cluster or population under study .",
    "this leads to a significant increase of the numbers of objects at the low - mass end because low - mass objects contribute to both low - mass singles and intermediate - mass binaries and thus more individual objects are required to reproduce the observed  @xcite . in the mass range @xmath39@xmath40 , systems can only be single because the system mass is the sum of the masses of the system members . increasing",
    "the system mass beyond @xmath40 causes the binary contribution to rise quickly and then to asymptotically approximate a maximum value .",
    "thus , the fraction of singles among m dwarfs is higher than for g dwarfs @xcite , as one would expect for a stellar population ( @xmath66 ) , i.e. essentially without bds .",
    "figure [ cartoon ] schematically shows the effects of correcting a flat continuous observed  for unresolved multiples whereby the binary fraction for bds is smaller than for stars , as is observed to be the case . for a binary fraction of 15  ( i.e. @xmath8 ) among bds there",
    "would thus be bds in total , while for stars with we would have .",
    "this exemplifies how the change in @xmath67 leads to a discontinuous .",
    ".[tabparspace]list of the variable parameters that span the parameter space of a two - population imf studied in this contribution .",
    "note that @xmath68 is not varied for ic  348 and the pleiades since it is not well - constrained by the data for these clusters . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "by correcting the observed mfs for unresolved multiple systems a discontinuity in the imf near the bd / vlms region emerges .",
    "we have also tried to model continuous single - body imfs , but we find this hypothesis of continuity to be inconsistent with the observed mfs given the observational data on the binary properties of stars and bds .",
    "we have shown that the _ empirically determined _ difference in the binary properties between bds / vlmss on the one hand side and stars on the other , and the _ empirical finding _ that stars and bds rarely pair , implies a discontinuity in the imf near the bd / vlmss mass .",
    "thus , the discontinuity in binary properties , which has already been interpreted to mean two separate populations @xcite , also implies a discontinuity in the imf .",
    "this relates the probably different formation mechanism more clearly to the observational evidence .",
    "we have performed a parameter survey allowing the imf parameters @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 to vary finding that the canonical stellar imf ( @xmath23 and @xmath25 ) can not be discarded even for ta , and that the bd / vlms discontinuity is required for all solutions .",
    "the discontinuity uncovered in this way , if measured at the classical bd - star border , is of a similar magnitude for the stellar clusters studied ( @xmath71 ) , supporting the concept of a universal imf , which is , by itself , rather notable .",
    "we recommend calling these populations _ bd - like _ and _ starlike _ with respect to their formation history .",
    "these populations have probably overlapping mass ranges since there is no physical reason for the upper mass limit of the bd - like population to match the lower mass limit of the starlike one .",
    "furthermore , the best - fit models suggest such an overlap between 0.07  and about 0.2  . according to this classification through the formation history ,",
    "bd - like objects would include vlmss , while starlike ones would include massive bds .",
    "the overlap region implies that bd - like pairs can consist of a vlms - bd pair , and that a starlike binary can consist of a stellar primary with a massive bd as a companion . as can be seen from table [ tabbinfrac ] ,",
    "the star - bd fractions are similar ( except for the dynamically unevolved ta ) and that the star - bd binary fraction , @xmath72 , is about 23 .",
    "this is somewhat higher than the value of @xmath73 bd companion fraction @xcite found for nearby stars but still far below the value expected for a single population model ( at least 7 - 15  in @xcite and @xmath74 in our calculations ) .",
    "simulations by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite predict a fraction of about 2  star - bd binaries ( actually one m dwarf with a bd companion out of 58 stars formed in three independent calculations ) . note that , in our model , @xmath72 is a prediction of the required overlap region and is sensitive to the overlapping range .",
    "as our model for the pleiades imf suggests , the overlapping range might be considerably smaller than that we have found for the other clusters .",
    "furthermore , we did not fit the lower mass border , @xmath75 , of the starlike population but simply assumed a value of 0.07  which is well in the bd mass regime ( and is the major source of star - bd binaries in our pleiades model ) .",
    "a slight increase of @xmath75 by only 0.01  would cause the pleiades star - bd binary fraction to drop to nearly zero .",
    "several authors doubt the existence of two separate populations .",
    "most recently , @xcite summarize that the observational community in general prefers the model of starlike formation for bds .",
    "they mention the detection of isolated proto(sub)stellar `` blobs '' in the ophiuchus b and d clouds , which may support the theory of starlike formation for bds .",
    "it remains unclear , though , how many of these blobs will actually form bds instead of dissolving from lack of gravitational binding energy .",
    "@xcite refer to a private communication with  .",
    "nordlund stating that the pure turbulence theory predicts about 20,000 transient cores for every actual pre - stellar core of about 0.1  .",
    "we recall that one of the main reasons for the existence of a separate population is the semi - major axis distribution of bd binaries ( fig .",
    "[ sepdist ] ) .",
    "but @xcite also mention a wide binary bd in ophiuchus with a separation of approximately 300  au .",
    "indeed , a small number of wide bd binaries are known .",
    "however , it can be doubted that the occasional discovery of a wide bd binary may expand the narrow semi - major axis distribution ( fig .",
    "[ sepdist ] ) to a starlike one .",
    "the striking evidence posed by the lack of bd companions to stars is a strong indication for two populations .",
    "it is usually ignored by the community , though .",
    "we note that even if there actually may be some bds that formed starlike they are most probably a minority .",
    "there is also the interpretation of the bd desert being a `` low-@xmath76 desert '' rather than an absolute mass - dependent drop in the companion mass function .",
    "@xcite find a low - mass companion desert of solar - type primary stars between approximately 0.01 and 0.06  .",
    "they find this interval to be dependent on the primary star mass and therefore predict m dwarfs to have bd companions , and that m dwarfs ought to have a companion desert between a few jupiter masses and the low - mass bd regime .",
    "however , this interpretation does not address the different orbital properties of bds and stars as well as the different @xmath76 distribution .",
    "can the existence of such a discontinuity , i.e. the formation of two separate populations , be understood theoretically ?",
    "although bds and stars appear to be distinct populations the formation of bds is likely to be connected to star formation .",
    "bate et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) show that bds significantly below 0.07  can not form in a classical way since the minimum mass they need for stellar - type formation would also lead to progressive accretion and growth to stellar mass unless they are in regions with very low mass infall rates .",
    "but such regions are very rare , because the prevailing densities and temperatures can not achieve the required jeans masses , as also stressed by @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "@xcite expected bds to be rare .",
    "only a small fraction of the bds , especially those at the high - mass end of the bd regime , may form this way if the surrounding gas has been consumed by star formation processes just after the proto - bd has reached the jeans mass . to explain the actually higher bd frequency ( per star ) in recent surveys",
    "the accretion process has to be terminated or impeded somehow @xcite .",
    "also the above - mentioned differences in the distribution of the semimajor axes between bds and stars can not be explained by a scaled - down star formation process , because that would imply a continuous variation and a much broader semi - major axis distribution for bds and vlmss that has not been observed @xcite .",
    "while binary stars show a very broad distribution of their semimajor axes peaking at about 30  au the semimajor axes of bds are distributed around about 5  au with a sharp truncation at 1015  au ( fig .",
    "[ sepdist ] ) .",
    "no smooth transition region between both regimes can be recognized @xcite . in a high angular resolution",
    "survey @xcite found that the orbital radius distribution of binaries with v - k @xmath77 6.5 appears to differ significantly from that of cooler ( and thus lower mass ) objects , suggesting a sudden change of the number of binaries wider than 10  au at about the m5 spectral type .",
    "this is in agreement with our finding of a possible bd - like population that extends beyond the hydrogen - burning mass limit into the vlms regime .    in a radial - velocity survey of chamaeleon i ,",
    "@xcite has found evidence for a rather low binary fraction below 0.1  au , while most companions found in that survey orbit their primaries within a few au .",
    "for this reason an extreme excess of close bd binaries that can not be resolved by imaging surveys appears to be unlikely . a larger binary fraction than about 15  would thus not be plausible .",
    "@xcite suggest an upper limit of @xmath78 for the bd binary fraction based on their own results ( @xmath79 , for separations below 6  au ) and the survey by close et al .",
    "( 2003 ; @xmath80 , for separations greater than 2.6  au ) by simple addition of the results .",
    "this is nearly consistent with a bd binary fraction of 15 , since the survey is neither magnitude- nor volume - limited .",
    "however , they admit that their value may be over - estimated since the objects with separations between 2.6 and 6  au are counted twice .",
    "we note further that even a total bd binary fraction of 25(@xmath81 ) , although outside the error limits of our best - fit models , would only lead to a minor change in the fitted imfs .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the lower binary fraction of bds is just the extension of a natural trend from g dwarfs to m dwarfs ( figs .",
    "[ fbin4 ] and [ fbuni ] ) .",
    "our contribution has shown that this trend can be understood by the simple fact that there are many fewer possibilities to form a binary near the lower mass end than for higher component masses .",
    "the observational data are in better agreement with a minimum mass , @xmath39 , near the hydrogen - burning mass limit and a low overall binary fraction of bd - like objects than with an `` all - in - one '' imf from the lowest mass bds to the upper stellar mass limit , as shown in figure [ fbuni ] .",
    "this observed trend thus appears as an additional enforcement of the two - populations model of bds and stars .    given that the conditions for a starlike formation of bds are very rare @xcite ,",
    "four alternative formation scenarios for bds apart from starlike formation can be identified , namely    1 .",
    "formation of wide star - bd binaries via fragmentation of a proto- or circumstellar disk and subsequent disruption by moderately close encounters .",
    "formation of bds as unfinished stellar embryos ejected from their birth system .",
    "removal of the accretion envelopes from low - mass protostars via photoevaporation .",
    "4 .   removal of the accretion envelopes due to extremely close stellar encounters @xcite .",
    "scenario 4 can be ruled out as the major bd formation mechanism because the probability of such close encounters , with required flyby distances typically below 10  au @xcite for efficient disruption of accretion envelopes ( less than a tenth of those proposed by thies et al .",
    "[ 2005 ] for triggered planet formation ) , is far too low for such a scenario being a significant contribution to bd formation .",
    "the photo evaporation model , as studied by @xcite , also can not be the major mechanism of bd formation @xcite .",
    "it predicts a variation of the imf with the population number and density of the host cluster .",
    "in dense starburst clusters ( young globular clusters ) with a larger number of o / b stars or even modest clusters such as the onc with a dozen o / b stars compared to ta , a larger fraction of low - mass stars would have halted in growth .",
    "this would result in a bias towards m dwarfs , since many of them would be failed k or g dwarfs .",
    "in contrast to this prediction , @xcite and @xcite show that the imfs of ta and onc are very similar in the mass range 0.11  , while globular clusters likewise have a low - mass mf similar to the standard form @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite introduced the formation of bds as ejected stellar embryos as the alternative scenario 2 . if a forming protostar in a newborn multiple system is ejected due to dynamical instability its accretion process is terminated and the object remains in a protostellar state with only a fraction of the mass compared to a fully developed star . since the final mass is physically independent of the hydrogen fusion mass limit one would not expect the mass range of ejected embryos to be truncated at the hbl and thus expect an _ overlap region _ between these populations .",
    "this fully agrees with the requirement of having to introduce such an overlap region in order to fit the observed  in   [ sec : method ] .",
    "this model gives some hints to understand the low bd binary fraction as well as the truncation of the semimajor axis distribution of bds .",
    "the decay of a young multiple system of three or more stellar embryos typically leads to the ejection of single objects but also to the ejection of a small fraction of close binaries . in order to survive the ejection , the semi - major axis of such",
    "a binary must be significantly smaller ( by a factor of about 3 ) than the typical orbital separation within the original multiple system .",
    "a similar explanation is that the orbital velocity of the bd binary components has to be higher than the typical ejection velocity in order to keep the interaction cross section of the binary with other system members small .",
    "indeed , the velocity dispersion of bds in the embryo - ejection model shown in @xcite is @xmath82 for the majority of the bds .",
    "this is in good agreement with the keplerian orbital velocity of each bd - binary member of about 1.5@xmath83 for an equal - mass binary of 0.050.08  and @xmath84 .",
    "the majority of bd binaries have smaller separations , and , consequently , higher orbital velocities and are bound tighter",
    ". this would set the low binding energy cut near @xmath85 in figure [ edist ] .",
    "there have been numerical simulations of star formation and dynamics , e.g. by @xcite and @xcite , in which binaries are produced via ejection that show remarkably similar properties to the actually observed ones .",
    "@xcite describe the formation of bds from decaying triple systems .",
    "their simulations predict a semi - major axis distribution between about 0.2 and 8  au ( see fig . 8 in their paper ) , peaking at 3  au .",
    "this is slightly shifted towards closer separations compared with the results by @xcite but still in agreement with the observational data .",
    "in contrast to this , @xcite doubt the frequent formation of close bd binaries via ejection , arguing that hydrogen - burning stars which formed via ejection were almost always single .",
    "in further qualitative support of the embryo ejection model , @xcite describe a deficit by a factor of 2 of bds near the highest density regions of ta relative to the bd abundance in the less dense regions that can possibly be explained by dynamical ejection and consequently larger velocity dispersion of stellar embryos , i.e. bds .",
    "a starlike fragmentation scenario would result in an opposite trend since the jeans mass is smaller for higher densities , thus allowing gas clumps of lower mass to form ( sub)stellar bodies .",
    "contrary to this , @xcite did not find any evidence for a different spatial distribution of bds and stars in ta .",
    "recently , @xcite have found that substellar objects in both the trapezium and ic  348 are distributed homogeneously within twice the cluster core radii while the stellar populations display a clustered distribution .",
    "they conclude that these distributions are best explained with a higher initial velocity dispersion of bds , in accordance with @xcite , supporting the embryo - ejection model .    however , the embryo - ejection model has a challenge to reproduce the high fraction of significant disks around bds that have been observed in young clusters .",
    "several studies , e.g. @xcite , reveal a considerable number of bds with an infrared excess that indicates the presence of warm circum(sub)stellar material .",
    "while these studies do not show the actual mass of these disks because a small amount of dust in these disks is sufficient to produce these excesses , @xcite found 25  of bds in ta having disks with radii @xmath86  au and significant masses ( larger than 0.4  @xmath87 ) .",
    "for the remaining 75  no disks were detectable . in simulations ,",
    "e.g. by @xcite , such large disks survive occasionally , but less frequently ( about 5 ) than suggested by the observations @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite point out that their results to not rule out the embryo - ejection scenario and admit that this mechanism may still be relevant for some bds .",
    "in general , the embryo - ejection model is in agreement with at least the existence of low - mass circumsubstellar disks up to about 10  au @xcite .",
    "@xcite also show that a thin low - mass disk can survive near - parabolic prograde coplanar encounters above about three hill radii with respect to the disk - hosting bd .",
    "this means that a disk with a radius up to about 5  au ( later viscously evolved to about 10  au , see @xcite ) can survive a flyby of an equal - mass embryo within about 15  au while larger disks or widely separated binaries would be disrupted .",
    "furthermore , @xcite suggest from their simulations that the binary fraction via ejection might by as small as about 5  ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the fragmentation of protobinary disks with subsequent disruption of a star - bd binary is another promising alternative scenario .",
    "a disk can fragment during the accretion process if it reaches a critical mass above which the disk becomes gravitationally unstable against small perturbations .",
    "fragmentation may be triggered by an external perturbation , i.e. infalling gas clumps or a passing neighbor star .",
    "the latter mechanism may also be capable of triggering fragmentation in relatively low - mass circumstellar disks resulting in rapid planet formation @xcite .",
    "thus , bd formation via disk fragmentation likely plays an important role in the early ages of the cluster where the frequency of massive disks is highest @xcite .",
    "following the argumentation of @xcite , disk fragmentation may explain the observed distribution of bd binary separations at least as well as the embryo - ejection model .",
    "in addition , it may explain the existence of wide star ",
    "bd binaries , since a fraction of the initial wide binaries can survive without being disrupted .",
    "because the likelihood of disrupting close encounters depends on the mass and density of the host cluster , one expects a higher fraction of those wide star - bd binaries in smaller and less dense clusters and associations like ta .",
    "however , further studies and observations are needed to test this hypothesis .",
    "@xcite show that bds can actually form as widely separated companions to low - mass stars with mass @xmath88 at a sufficiently large disk radius , @xmath89 , @xmath90 where the disk is cool enough to allow a substellar clump to undergo gravitational collapse . for a primary star below 0.2  this minimum radius therefore becomes less than 90  au which is in remarkable agreement with the two wider vlms binaries found by @xcite .",
    "such large distances to the primary star allow the formation of bd - bd binaries as well as the survival of circumsubstellar disks up to about 1030  au , depending on the total mass of the presubstellar core and the mass of the primary star .",
    "furthermore , this scenario explains the existence of wide star - bd binaries .",
    "in addition , such a wide star - bd binary can be disrupted by moderately close encounters of about 100200  au ( i.e. a distance similar to the star - bd orbital radius ) , the disruption of such systems appears to be likely in contrast to the disruption of accretion envelopes as required in the already rejected scenario 4 .",
    "both the embryo - ejection model and disk fragmentation with subsequent wide binary disruption explain the above - mentioned connection between stars and bds , since bds start to form like stars before their growth is terminated due to their separation from their host system or from lack of surrounding material in the outer parts of a circumstellar disk .",
    "it is obvious that the formation rate of these embryos is proportional to the total star formation rate .    for these reasons",
    "these formation mechanisms appear to be the most likely ones for bds and some vlmss and bd / vlms binaries .",
    "it can not be decided yet which scenario is the dominant mechanism .",
    "this may depend on the size and the density of the star - forming region .",
    "we expect , on the other hand , the classical starlike formation scenario to be of some importance only for the most massive bds .",
    "the possibility of two different _ alternative _ bd formation mechanisms ( disk fragmentation and embryo ejection ) may lead to another discontinuity in the intermediate mass bd imf since both scenarios correspond to different binary fractions as mentioned above .",
    "the currently available data , however , are far from being sufficient for a verification of this prediction .",
    "the different empirical binary properties of bds and stars strongly imply the existence of two separate but mutually related populations .",
    "we have shown that if the imf of bds and stars is analyzed under consideration of their binary properties then there is a discontinuity in the transition region between the substellar and stellar regime that is quite independent of the host cluster .",
    "the discontinuity in the imf near the hbl is a strong logical implication of the disjunct binary properties and suggests splitting up the imf into two components , the bd - like and the starlike regime .",
    "an alternative but equivalent description would be to view the stellar imf as a continuous distribution function ranging from about 0.07 to 150  @xcite , and a causally connected but disjoint distribution of ( probably mostly ) separated ultra  low - mass companions and ejected embryos with masses ranging from 0.01  to 0.10.2  . while the canonical stellar imf is consistent with the observed stellar mfs at least for the trapezium , ic  348 , and the pleiades , the sub - stellar imf of at least the trapezium and ta has a power law index that is consistent with the canonical value @xmath91 . within the error limits , our analysis does not reject the canonical power law indices for bds and stars for any cluster .",
    "the discontinuity is often masked in the observational data due to a mass overlap of both populations in the bd - vlms region as well as the higher apparent masses of unresolved binaries compared to single objects in the observed .",
    "the discontinuity in the number density near the hbl is a step of approximately a factor of 35 ( table [ tabbinfrac ] ) .",
    "this implies a general dependency between both populations and is , as far as we can tell , consistent with the scenario of disrupted wide binaries @xcite as well as with the truncated - star scenario ( e.g. as an ejected stellar embryo , @xcite ) , since the number of unready stars is directly correlated with the total amount of star formation in the host cluster .",
    "both embryo - ejection and wide binary disruption are also consistent with the properties of close binary bds .",
    "our results ( tab . [ tabalpha ] ) suggest that about one bd is produced per 46 formed stars .",
    "this suggests the necessity of a distinct description of bds and stars as well as the connection between these two populations through their formation process .",
