    "for instance , in order to fit the cluster lower ms , a lower age must be used , but this eliminates the hb in the model , as we just mentioned . on the other hand , to better fit the hb , a very low metallicity must be adopted , which jeopardizes the fits to the other locci and also is in clear conflict with the spectroscopic metallicity determination by @xcite .    in order to determine parameter uncertainties and to test our visual fit",

    "the annuli used for the rdp construction were the same as in the completeness analysis .",
    "building a meaningful rdp , however , requires some cautionary steps .",
    "one is finding out the cluster centre , which is determined by the following method : ( i ) we count stars along the x - axis ; ( ii ) the peak of this distribution is then assumed to be the x coordinate of the centre . the same procedure is then applied to the y - axis . for a spherical distribution this procedure clearly yields the centre of the distribution of stars , which may also be assumed to be approximately the centre of mass .",
    "adoption of alternative methods show that our centre determination is robust .",
    "another important issue is the effect of field boundaries .",
    "they cause areal completeness effects at the outer radial bins , which had to be taken into account in the density estimates . for that purpose",
    ", we applied a monte carlo integral to find out the fraction of the total area in each bin which was effectively sampled by the image .",
    "notice that in the proximity of the image boundary the error associated to the density estimate grows significantly due to the increased loss of areal sampling .",

    "the @xmath76 uncertainty range is also shown , as the grey region . in the inset we show the rdp that results from counting all stars with the same weight ( therefore not corrected for completeness ) .",
    "clearly , completeness corrections are crucial , especially in the central and denser regions , making the rdp much steeper than the uncorrected one .",
    "the completeness corrected rdp has no evidence for a core - like flattening .",

    "[ cmd ] we can visually identify some bs . the number of candidate bs stars , as selected from their cmd position , is 50% higher in the gc region than in the general field .",
    "as the gc region represents only 10% of the total image , the excess of bs candidates per unit area is a factor @xmath81 higher than the field .",
    "this inequivocaly shows that these stars have a high probability of being cluster members .",
    "bs are known to be strongly concentrated towards the centre in most gcs , adding support to their possible origin from mergers of cluster stars or coalescence of tightly bound binaries .",

    "this inversion in the pdmf slope is atypical , although it has been previously observed and is supported by dynamical n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "our findings concerning the pdmf of , which resides in a violent environment , can be explained in terms of disk and bulge shocking through its perigalacticon passages @xcite .",
    "the high resolution images available nowadays are allowing us to observe these phenomena more frequently and strongly suggest that dynamical effects over a gc life - time have a dominant contribution from the external environment .",
    "an interesting feature that is expected to result from the high degree of depletion of low mass stars is the presence of a tidal tail around . for this purpose ,",
    "a more sophisticated field decontamination technique must be adopted such as the statistical analysis of cmds @xcite . from the analysis of the rdp of it",
    "is not clear that we have reached the tidal radius of the gc ; thus , for the analysis of a possible tidal tail it is necessary to have images with a wider field .",
    "the tidal tail search could make the estimate of the mass loss due to tidal erosion possible .",
