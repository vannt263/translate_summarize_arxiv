    "despite recent advances in the field of star formation , the origin of open clusters remains a mystery .",
    "it is now generally accepted that all stars are born within groups .",
    "these groups are at first heavily embedded within molecular clouds , their members obscured optically by copious interstellar dust . by the time the stars are revealed , only about 10  percent are in open clusters @xcite .",
    "the remainder are in either t- or ob associations , both destined to disperse within a few myr .",
    "in contrast , the stars within open clusters are gravitationally bound to each other , and the group can survive intact for several gyr @xcite .",
    "how do molecular clouds spawn these relatively rare but stable configurations ?",
    "one intriguing aspect of the mystery is that open clusters are intermediate in their properties between t- and ob associations .",
    "the former are relatively sparse in projected stellar density , and contain up to about 100 members ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the latter , as exemplified by the nearby orion nebula cluster , begin with extraordinarily high density @xcite and contain well over a thousand members @xcite , far more than the eponymous o and b stars . a published compilation of galactic open clusters @xcite shows them to have from a few hundred to roughly a thousand stars , i.e. , just in the middle range .",
    "apparently , systems born with either too low or too high a population and density are fragile , while the relative minority falling in between can survive .",
    "there is already an extensive literature on young , bound clusters , both observational and theoretical ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "models for their origin , dating back at least to @xcite , have focused on the need for a high star formation efficiency in the parent cloud .",
    "a standard computational technique , using n - body simulations , is to create stars in a background potential well , remove that potential through various prescriptions , and then assess the result ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some researchers using this approach , implemented either analytically or numerically , have hypothesized that open clusters are the bound remnants of expanding ob  associations @xcite . in recent years , most theoretical ideas have been motivated by fluid dynamical simulations of turbulent , collapsing clouds @xcite . while much insight has been gained from these collective investigations , there has generally been too little contact of the theory with actual groups . a clear advance would be made if we could establish empirically the original state of one or more observed clusters .",
    "we would then be in a position to gauge how these particular systems were produced by star formation activity in their parent clouds .",
    "as a first step in this direction , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) undertook a quantitative study of the _ present - day _ structure of a well - studied , relatively nearby open cluster , the pleiades .",
    "we derived statistically , using a maximum likelihood analysis , such key properties as the stellar density distribution , mass function , overall binary fraction , and correlation between the component masses of these binaries .",
    "the point of that study was to provide the endpoint for any calculation of the system s previous evolution .",
    "we now take the second step .",
    "the age of the pleiades has been determined , from observations of lithium depletion , to be 125  myr @xcite . using the publicly available code starlab ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix b ) , we have run a suite of n - body calculations over just this time period , to find that initial state which evolved to the current cluster , as gauged by our previous investigation . in doing so",
    ", we also establish the detailed history of the group over that epoch , and even into the future .",
    "a key assumption here is that the pleiades divested itself of cloud gas relatively soon after its birth .",
    "there is currently no direct means to assess the duration of the initial , embedded phase , either in the pleiades or any other open cluster we may take a clue from t  associations , which are still surrounded ( but not completely obscured ) by molecular gas .",
    "no systems are observed with ages exceeding about 5  myr , a striking fact first noted by @xcite .",
    "presumably , older groups consisting of post - t  tauri stars have already driven away their clouds and are merged observationally into the field population . if a similar embedded period held for the pleiades , it indeed represents a small fraction of the total age .",
    "hence , we can establish , with some confidence , the cluster s structure just after cloud dispersal .",
    "a future study will investigate , using a combination of gaseous and stellar dynamics , how this early configuration itself arose .    in section  2 below",
    ", we describe in more detail our approach to the problem .",
    "we define the parameters characterizing both the initial configuration of the cluster and the evolved system .",
    "we then outline our strategy for finding the optimal initial state , i.e. , the one whose descendent matches most closely the current pleiades .",
    "our actual numerical results are presented in section  3 . here , we give the detailed properties of the inferred initial state .",
    "we also describe how the cluster changed up to the present , and how it will develop in the future .",
    "one of our key findings is that the cluster s evolution did _ not _ proceed in the classic manner associated with dynamical relaxation ( * ? ?",
    "* chapter  8) ; we explore the origin of this discrepancy .",
    "finally , section  4 discusses the implications of our findings on the earlier , embedded evolution of this , and other , open clusters .",
    "as in paper i , we model the pleiades as a perfectly spherical system , although the cluster is observed to be slightly elongated @xcite . this elongation seems to have been created by the tidal gravity of the galaxy @xcite , which would have exerted influence throughout the cluster s dynamical history .",
    "we assume that this modest tidal stretching had negligible effect on the internal evolution , and that relatively few stars were lost by tidal stripping over the pleiades age .",
    "thus we can safely ignore the associated galactic potential .",
    "similarly , we ignore mass loss through stellar evolution , which is negligible for our adopted mass function , over the 125 myr age of the pleiades . in sections 3.2 and 3.3 ,",
    "we present simulations that include both effects    returning to our standard runs , we further assume that the cluster was in virial equilibrium following expulsion of the gas . any significant departure from equilibrium would be erased on a dynamical time scale , about 10  myr for our input parameters and therefore much shorter than the evolutionary span of interest .",
    "two popular choices for spherical equilibria are @xcite models and polytropes .",
    "as will be explained in section 2.3 , king models do not include low enough density contrasts for a full exploration of initial states .",
    "we therefore used polytropes , which are more versatile in this regard . in polytropes , the stellar distribution function @xmath0 , i.e.",
    ", the number of stars per volume in configuration and velocity space , is given by @xmath1 here , @xmath2 is a normalization constant , while @xmath3 , the relative energy per unit mass , is @xmath4 in this last equation , @xmath5 denotes the stellar speed .",
    "thus , @xmath3 is the negative of the physical energy , and also has an offset in its zero point , as conventionally defined .",
    "this offset is embedded in the relative potential @xmath6 , which is related to the usual gravitational potential @xmath7 by @xmath8 the tidal radius @xmath9 marks the outer boundary reached by cluster stars . by construction ,",
    "the relative potential @xmath10 is positive inside the cluster and falls to zero at .",
    "the number of stars per unit volume is found by integrating the distribution function over velocity space .",
    "the manipulations here are standard ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 ) , so we give only the essential results .",
    "we let @xmath11 denote the stellar mass , assumed provisionally to be identical for all cluster members",
    ". then @xmath12 , the mass density of stars , is @xmath13 here , is the maximum speed for a star at radius @xmath14 .",
    "for such a star , . the total physical energy per unit mass , , is @xmath15 , so the star can just reach @xmath9 . using equation  ( 2 ) , equation",
    "( 4 ) becomes @xmath16 we define a new variable , so that @xmath17 to calculate the relative potential @xmath6 , we use poisson s equation . for our spherical system , this is @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the central values of @xmath21 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "we define a dimensionless potential as , and a dimensionless radius as , where the scale radius @xmath22 is @xmath23 since , the new potential obeys the lane - emden equation : @xmath24 with boundary conditions and .",
    "the nondimensional tidal radius is the point where @xmath25 falls to zero .",
    "is derived within each polytropic model .",
    "we stress that , despite the nomenclature , this ",
    "tidal \" radius bears no relation to the truncation created by the galactic potential . in section 3.3 ,",
    "we describe simulations that include the external field . ]    for any chosen polytropic index @xmath26 , equation  ( 10 ) can readily be solved numerically .",
    "our task is to translate this nondimensional solution into a physical model of the initial cluster . given @xmath26 , the basic quantities characterizing the cluster are : @xmath27 , the total number of stars ; @xmath28 , the virial radius ; and @xmath11 , the mean stellar mass . and @xmath28 ,",
    "the mean mass @xmath11 is not an independent parameter , but follows from our specified mass function and prescription for binaries ; see  2.1.2 below . ]",
    "the virial radius is defined by @xmath29 here , is the total cluster mass , while @xmath30 is the gravitational potential energy : @xmath31 in appendix a , we show how to obtain the dimensional quantities @xmath22 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 from our three input parameters and the solution @xmath32",
    ".    given the scale factors @xmath22 and @xmath19 , we know the dimensional mass density @xmath21 .",
    "we then populate space with stars according to a normalized distribution @xmath33 such that is the probability a star is located between @xmath14 and . this probability is simply @xmath34 the actual position vector of each star is then distributed isotropically within each radial shell .",
    "finally , we require an analogous distribution for stellar speeds . at a given radius , the speed must be consistent with the prescribed energy distribution .",
    "let @xmath35 be the probability that the speed lies between @xmath5 and @xmath36 _ given _ that its radius is @xmath14 .",
    "clearly , @xmath37 replacing @xmath38 by @xmath39 and @xmath40 by @xmath41 , we have , after using equation  ( 13 ) , @xmath42 we take from equation  ( 1 ) and use the definition of @xmath3 from equation  ( 2 ) , finding @xmath43^{n-3/2 } v^2 \\,\\,.\\ ] ] here , the relative potential is calculated at each @xmath14 from , where we recall that @xmath44 is the nondimensional radius .",
    "given the stellar speed , i.e. , the magnitude of the velocity vector , the direction of that vector is again distributed isotropically in space .",
    "thus far , we have described a cluster that is composed of members with identical mass . in actual practice ,",
    "we assign masses to the stars according to a realistic distribution .",
    "the parameters of this mass function for the initial cluster are among those we vary to obtain an optimal match between the evolved system and the present - day pleiades .",
    "in the course of evolution , some stars will be given enough energy , through three - body interactions , to escape the cluster .",
    "the most massive ones die out over 125  myr .",
    "it is therefore not obvious that the initial mass function is identical to that found today .",
    "we suppose that the distribution of stellar masses in the young pleiades was similar in form to the initial mass function for the field population . in recent years",
    ", large - scale surveys of low - luminosity objects , combined with spectroscopy , have established an accurate initial mass function down to the brown dwarf limit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the consensus is that the original power law of @xcite for masses above solar is joined at the lower end by a lognormal function .",
    "this basic form appears to hold in diverse environments , including young clusters @xcite .",
    "let @xmath45 be the probability that a star s mass ( in solar units ) is between @xmath11 and @xmath46 .",
    "we posit that this probability is @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and the joining mass @xmath51 are all constants .",
    "we set and ( although we also tested a higher mass limit ; see  3.2 below ) .",
    "the variable @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 here , @xmath54 is the centroid of the lognormal function , and @xmath55 its width . for input parameters",
    "@xmath50 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , the constants @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath51 are determined by the normalization condition @xmath56 and by requiring that @xmath57 and its first derivative be continuous at .",
    "analytic expressions may be found for the three constants , which we do not display here .",
    "most stars are not single objects , but have binary companions .",
    "indeed , the pleiades today is especially rich in binaries ( see  3.4 of paper  i ) .",
    "such pairing must have been present in the initial cluster .",
    "we therefore view the positions and velocities established in the previous subsection as pertaining to @xmath27 _ stellar systems _ , rather than individual stars .",
    "similarly , the symbol @xmath11 used , e.g. , in equation  ( 13 ) , actually denotes the _ average system mass _ , after accounting for binaries .",
    "we specify the global binary fraction as a parameter @xmath58 , which gives the probability that a system actually consists of two stars .",
    "conversely , a fraction of the systems are indeed single stars . their mass is distributed according to the probability @xmath57 .",
    "our analysis of the present pleiades in paper  i showed that the masses of the component stars within binaries are correlated .",
    "such a correlation must also have been present at early times .",
    "accordingly , we include the effect in our initial state . within the fraction @xmath58 of systems that are binaries",
    ", we first independently assign masses to each component , using the probability distribution @xmath57 . after identifying the primary mass @xmath59 and the secondary mass @xmath60 ,",
    "we then alter the latter to @xmath61 , where @xmath62 here , @xmath63 is an input parameter that measures the degree of mass correlation within binaries ( see also eq .",
    "( 42 ) of paper  i ) .",
    "if , the component masses are uncorrelated , while corresponds to perfect matching .",
    "we give our binaries randomly inclined orbital planes , and a period and eccentricity distribution characteristic of present , solar - type binaries both in the field @xcite and in the pleiades itself @xcite .",
    "if @xmath64 is the fraction of systems with periods between @xmath65 and @xmath66 , then @xmath67 is lognormal : @xmath68 where @xmath69 we set the centroid period to and the width to , where the period is measured in days .",
    "the eccentricity distribution has a thermal distribution : @xmath70 as motivated both by observations @xcite and theory @xcite .",
    "the initial cluster described thus far is homogenous , in the sense that any volume containing an appreciable number of systems has the same average system mass .",
    "however , there have long been claims of observed _ mass segregation _ in young clusters , i.e. , an increase of average stellar mass toward the center @xcite .",
    "the present - day pleiades also exhibits this phenomenon to a striking degree ( see  4.2 of paper  i ) .",
    "we want to see if this property developed on its own or was inherited from an earlier epoch .",
    "we accordingly include a quantitative prescription for mass segregation in our initial state .",
    "one system has a higher probability of being near the cluster center than another , in a time - averaged sense , if its relative energy @xmath3 is greater .",
    "mass segregation therefore manifests itself as a correlation between the system mass @xmath11 and @xmath3 .",
    "this fact was noted by @xcite , who used it to implement a specific procedure for mass segregation .",
    "here we have adopted a variant of their method that allows us to include the effect to a variable degree .",
    "we first assign @xmath3- and @xmath11-values to all member systems according to equation  ( 1 ) and our prescription for binary masses .",
    "we then place the systems in two lists - the first ordered by increasing @xmath11 , and the second by increasing @xmath3 .",
    "when we first construct these lists , the ranking of the system in the first is unrelated to its ranking in the second . this is the case of zero mass segregation .",
    "there would be perfect mass segregation if the two rankings were identical .",
    "let us quantify the intermediate case .",
    "for a star of given mass , we find its index in the mass - ordered list .",
    "to assign an energy to that star , we choose the second ( energy - ordered ) index from a gaussian distribution centered on the mass index .",
    "the width of this distribution , denoted @xmath71 , can be infinite ( no mass segregation ) or zero ( perfect segregation ) . more generally , we define a parameter @xmath72 , the degree of mass segregation , which varies between 0 and 1 . after some trial and error , we adopted the following prescription relating the width @xmath71 to @xmath72 : @xmath73 the logarithmic dependence on @xmath72 ensures that @xmath71 has the desired behavior in the extreme limits .",
    "the proportionality with @xmath27 ensures that our algorithm gives the same degree of biasing in clusters of any population .    in summary ,",
    "@xmath72 becomes another input parameter that we vary within the initial configuration .",
    "as we will see , having a non - zero @xmath72 is critical to obtaining a proper match between the evolved cluster and the pleiades today .",
    "mass segregation was therefore present at a relatively early epoch .",
    "since relatively massive stars preferentially reside near the center , our imposition of mass segregation alters the shape of the gravitational potential from that of a single - mass polytrope .",
    "relative to the total gravitational energy , the total kinetic energy has a value slightly below that for virial equilibrium .",
    "we rescaled all stellar velocities by a uniform factor to restore exact equilibrium .",
    "in practice , this factor was typically about 1.05",
    ".    for convenient reference , table  1 lists the full set of our input parameters for the starting state . anticipating the results detailed in  3 below",
    ", the last column gives the numerical value of each parameter in the optimal configuration .",
    "we also list the associated uncertainties .",
    "the meaning of these uncertainties and how they were assessed , will also be discussed presently .      after evolving a particular initial state for 125  myr",
    ", we compare the outcome with the actual pleiades . in making this comparison ,",
    "it is important to `` observe '' the simulated cluster under the same conditions as the real one .",
    "thus , we project the three - dimensional distribution of stars onto a two - dimensional plane , assumed to lie at the mean pleiades distance of 133  pc @xcite .",
    "the angular separation @xmath74 between each pair of stars is then determined .",
    "if @xmath75 denotes the telescope resolution , then any pair with is taken to be an unresolved point source .",
    "for the near - infrared catalog of the pleiades analyzed in paper  i @xcite , an appropriate value of @xmath75 is 10  arcsec .",
    "note that our unresolved sources include a small fraction ( less than 0.5  percent ) of triples and high - order systems , as well as a few unrelated pairs observed to be close in projection .",
    "we denote as @xmath76 the total number of point sources out to a radius from the cluster center of 12.3  pc , corresponding in angle to @xmath77 .",
    "this was the radius enclosing the catalog of sources used in paper  1 .",
    "for each simulated evolution , we compare the final @xmath76-value with the observed pleiades figure .    the vast majority of stars observed in the pleiades today are on the main sequence ( see fig .  1 of paper  1 ) .",
    "the number of post - main - sequence objects , while relatively small , is sensitive to the shape of the stellar mass function .",
    "hence , it is important that we reproduce , as closely as possible , the number inferred for the present - day cluster . at an age of 125  myr ,",
    "the main - sequence turnoff is about @xmath78 . if @xmath79 denotes the number of stars ( singles or primary stars in binaries ) whose mass exceeds @xmath78 , then this quantity , as calculated ,",
    "may also be compared directly with that in the pleiades .",
    "similarly , we compare @xmath80 , the total mass of all stars in the evolved cluster , with the pleiades mass obtained through the statistical analysis of paper  1 .",
    "one striking result of paper  1 was the prevalence of binaries .",
    "specifically , we found that the near - infrared fluxes of the catalogued point sources demanded that the fraction were unresolved binaries .",
    "( any resolved binaries were listed in the catalog as separate sources . ) for our assumed resolution limit @xmath75 , we could also assess @xmath81 computationally for each evolutionary run .",
    "again , this is the fraction of point sources representing two or more unresolved stars .",
    "note that @xmath81 is less than the _ initially _ imposed binary fraction @xmath58 , both because some pairs are wide enough to be resolved , and because others are torn apart in the course of evolution .",
    "the distribution of stellar masses is , of course , another property that should be compared with the actual pleiades .",
    "as just described , we set the form of the distribution within the initial configuration as a lognormal function with a power - law tail .",
    "the apportionment of masses within the evolved state could in principle differ , due to the escape of some stars from the cluster and the death of others with sufficiently high mass .",
    "our procedure is first to find , within the output state , the normalized distribution of single stars .",
    "included in this distribution are both isolated stars and the components of _ resolved _ binaries .",
    "we then peer within _ unresolved _ binaries and find the analogous distributions of primary mass @xmath59 and secondary mass @xmath60 . finally , we record the distribution of the binary mass ratio , .    in paper",
    "i , we statistically determined the stellar masses from the photometric data by assuming that the single - star distribution was a pure lognormal , with centroid @xmath54 and width @xmath55 . for consistency , we characterize the evolved cluster in our simulations in a similar fashion . now for a given single - star function and binary correlation parameter @xmath63 , the primary , secondary , and @xmath82-distributions are all uniquely determined .",
    "appendix  b outlines the mathematical derivation .",
    "the task is to vary @xmath63 , as well as @xmath54 and @xmath55 , for the presumed lognormal single - star distribution until this function , as well as the primary , secondary , and @xmath82-distributions , best fit those we find directly in the numerical output .",
    "we then compare @xmath63 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 to these same quantities derived in a similar way for the observed pleiades .",
    "we next consider the projected density profile .",
    "we divide the cluster into radial bins that match those used in the analysis of the pleiades .",
    "the resulting surface density of stellar systems is then fit to the empirical prescription of @xcite : @xmath83 here , @xmath84 is the projected radius , @xmath85 is a constant with the dimensions of a surface density , and @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the core and tidal radii , respectively .",
    "we determine the values of @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 which best match the data , i.e. , the same parameters determined for the real pleiades by an analogous fitting procedure .",
    "however , only @xmath86 is used in the final optimization routine ( see below ) .",
    "we also determine the king concentration parameter , both for each evolved simulation and in the real cluster . from equation  ( 25 )",
    ", the central surface density @xmath88 is @xmath89 this is also compared to the pleiades value .",
    "finally , we measure the degree of mass segregation . for the evolved cluster ,",
    "we compute the cumulative fraction of systems contained within a projected radius @xmath84 , both by number ( @xmath90 ) and mass ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "as in paper  i (  4.2 ) , the gini coefficient is computed as @xmath92 and then compared to that found in the pleiades .",
    "table  2 gives the full list of quantities evaluated for each evolved cluster .",
    "we also display the values found when the optimal initial state is used , as well as the corresponding figures in the actual pleiades .",
    "notice that @xmath54 and @xmath55 for the mass function do not match those in the initial state , as given in table  1 .",
    "this discrepancy arises partly from real changes of the stellar masses , but even more from our adoption of a simple lognormal when fitting the evolved cluster .",
    "the tabulated errors for the calculated quantities were obtained by running 25 simulations , all with identical input parameters . since we populated the cluster stochastically , according to probability distributions ( e.g. , @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( 17 ) ) , initial states differed from one another in detail .",
    "the errors represent the standard deviations for each quantity in the evolved cluster , due solely to differing realizations of the initial state .",
    "the tabulated errors for the observed pleiades are from the calculation of paper  i. in addition , @xmath76 and @xmath79 are assumed to be poisson - distributed , so that the errors are @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively .      as a first guess",
    ", we set all the input parameters equal to values appropriate for the pleiades today . in paper",
    "i , we characterized the present - day cluster as a king model , so we initially adopted this prescription .",
    "the analytic models of @xcite have the distribution function @xmath95 here @xmath20 , the central value of the relative potential , is again set by our basic input quantities .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath96 , like @xmath97 , characterizes the degree of central concentration . to @xmath97",
    "is shown in figure  ( 4 - 10 ) of @xcite .",
    "the independent variable in their plot , called @xmath98 , is precisely @xmath96 . ]",
    "running a king model for 125  myr , we found that it invariably became more centrally concentrated than the actual pleiades .",
    "we therefore tried successively lower @xmath96-values for the initial state .",
    "now equation  ( 28 ) shows that @xmath99 is proportional to @xmath3 in the limit of small @xmath96 .",
    "comparison with equation  ( 1 ) reveals that such a model is equivalent to a polytrope of .",
    "our search for low - concentration initial states therefore led us naturally to the polytropic models described in  2.1 . within the regime of polytropes with small @xmath26 , we varied other input parameters , such as @xmath28 , as necessary .    once our computed cluster began to resemble the pleiades , we changed to a more systematic gradient method for refining the initial state .",
    "let @xmath100 be the vector whose elements are the 9 input parameters listed in table  1",
    ". similarly , let @xmath101 represent the 11 evolved cluster properties of table  2 .",
    "this latter vector is , of course , a function of @xmath100 . to move @xmath101 toward the values characterizing today s pleiades , we need to evaluate , in some sense , the gradient of this function .",
    "a practical complication is one to which we alluded earlier . even among evolutionary runs assuming an identical input vector @xmath100 ,",
    "the resulting @xmath101 differs because of the stochastic sampling of the various assumed distribution functions . in computing the gradient",
    ", we need to take a step size @xmath102 large enough that the resulting change in @xmath101 exceeds that due to this realization variance .",
    "we found that the prescription sufficed for this purpose [ for a more rigorous justification]p02 .    for each @xmath100 , we first do 9 runs and average the result to obtain .",
    "we then decrease , in turn , each element @xmath103 to , and find the average output of two runs at each decreased @xmath103-value .",
    "similarly , we find the average result of two runs at each .",
    "we thus establish the matrix of derivatives @xmath104 , whose elements are @xmath105 the change in outputs for any subsequent input change @xmath106 may then be approximated by @xmath107 here , the vector @xmath108 is taken to be the difference between the current @xmath101-vector and that for the pleiades .",
    "we may evaluate the 9 elements @xmath109 by solving the 11 linear equations summarized in  ( 29 ) .",
    "since the system is overdetermined , we did a least - squares fit to find that set of @xmath109 which best satisfied the equations .",
    "as we took a step in @xmath100 , we evaluated how close the resulting @xmath101 was to @xmath110 , the aggregate properties of the observed pleiades .",
    "we did a @xmath111-test , where @xmath112 here , each @xmath113 is the average @xmath114 value , established by doing 9 runs with identical input values .",

    "almost all the stellar systems are binaries .",

    "we see how nearly equal - mass systems are strongly favored for our best - fit @xmath63 of 0.73 . in the simulations ,",

    "we can now describe , based on our suite of simulations , the evolution of the cluster from its initial state to the present epoch .",
    "the main trend is an overall expansion of the system .",
    "this tendency is clear in figure  5 , which shows the variation in time of the virial radius , @xmath28 .",
    "after an initial drop , lasting about two crossing times the radius steadily swells , increasing by about 40  percent to the present . from the definition of @xmath28 in equation  ( 11 ) , we infer that the gravitational potential energy @xmath30 is decreasing in absolute magnitude , i.e. , the cluster is gradually becoming less bound .",
    "note that we do not obtain @xmath28 by calculating @xmath30 directly , but through fitting the cluster at each time to a king model , and then finding the appropriate @xmath28 for the best - fit model parameters .",
    "figure  5 shows that @xmath86 , the projected core radius , displays similar behavior to @xmath28 .",
    "after the transient phase which again lasts about two crossing times , @xmath86 also swells , albeit more slowly .",
    "analogous early adjustments are evident in other global quantities ( see figs . 6 - 8) .",
    "this transient results from our implementation of mass segregation , which alters slightly the gravitational potential ( recall section 2.1.2 ) .",
    "although the initial cluster is in virial equilibrium , the stellar distribution function is no longer a steady - state solution to the collsionless boltzmann equation . within the first two crossing times",
    ", the distribution readjusts to become such a solution .",
    "the core radius bounces , before settling to a value that subsequently evolves more gradually .",
    "expansion of a cluster s outer halo is one manifestation of dynamical relaxation .",
    "however , application of equation  ( 4 - 9 ) of @xcite , with , reveals that the relaxation time is 250  myr , or about twice the pleiades age .",
    "in addition , the inner cores of relaxing systems shrink , giving energy to the halo .",
    "the secular expansion of @xmath86 further indicates that we are _ not _ witnessing the usual effects of dynamical relaxation .",
    "figure  6 provides yet another illustration of this point . here",
    ", we see that the king concentration parameter @xmath97 remains virtually constant , again following an initial adjustment .",
    "recall that , where @xmath87 is the projected tidal radius .",
    "thus , @xmath87 and @xmath86 swell at about the same pace .    the projected surface number density , @xmath134 , currently peaks strongly at ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the actually central value , however , previously declined from an even higher level .",
    "figure  7 shows this gradual decline , which is consistent with the previously noted rise in @xmath86 .",
    "thus , @xmath86 increases from 1.6 to 2.2  pc over the period from to . over the same interval",
    ", @xmath88 falls by a factor of 0.50 , which is close to @xmath135 .",
    "the number of systems in the core therefore remains virtually constant as the core itself expands .",
    "the volumetric number density similarly falls in the central region .    in paper",
    "i , we documented a strong degree of mass segregation in the current pleiades , quantifying this property through the gini coefficient .",
    "another result of the current study is that @xmath136 did _ not _ attain its current value through purely stellar dynamical evolution .",
    "as seen in the top curve of figure  8 , @xmath137 rose only slightly at first , and then remained nearly constant , even declining somewhat in the recent past .",
    "initial states in which the parameter @xmath72 was too low never attained the requisite degree of mass segregation .",
    "as an illustration , figure  8 shows also the result from a single simulation using @xmath138 initially .",
    "the gini coefficient does grow , but not by enough to match observations .",
    "we note , parenthetically , that @xmath137 exhibits oscillatory behavior over the a period that roughly matches the crossing time . these oscillations ( unlike the initial readjustment )",
    "were washed out in the averaging procedure that produced the top curve in the figure .",
    "finally , we remark that @xmath137 appears to saturate in time .",
    "we will return to this interesting phenomenon shortly .",
    "all the simulations we have described thus far ignored any effects of stellar evolution .",
    "we could afford this simplification because of the relatively small number of cluster members that would have evolved significantly over 125  myr .",
    "the code starlab does have the capability of tracking stellar evolution , including mass loss , through fitting formulae . as a check , we retained our usual maximum mass of @xmath139 and ran 25 simulations using the best - fit initial cluster parameters , but with stellar evolution included .",
    "the mass loss from relatively massive cluster members did not have a significant dynamical effect , and the endstate of the cluster was essentially identical .",
    "with reference to table  2 , the only parameter that changed appreciably was @xmath79 , which fell .    in more detail , the few stars above 7  @xmath140 usually evolved to white dwarfs of approximately solar mass . on average , about 10 white dwarfs formed ,",
    "of which 7 were the secondaries within binaries .",
    "even the few that were primaries were faint relative to their main - sequence companions , and thus would be difficult to detect .",
    "our findings are thus consistent with the observation of @xcite that white dwarfs are generally rarer in open clusters than might be expected statistically from the initial mass function .    finally , we relaxed the upper mass limit in the single - star mass function and allowed the maximum mass to be arbitrarily large , according to the power law in equation  ( 17 ) .",
    "choosing stars stochastically from this distribution yielded a few members with masses as high as @xmath141 . if we again allowed for stellar evolution and used our standard initial cluster parameters , the evolution _ did _ take a different turn .",
    "the very massive stars represented a significant fraction of the total cluster mass , and their death had a quantitative impact .",
    "as before , the cluster went through an initial adjustment , partially from the heavier stellar mass loss . the system",
    "then smoothly expanded , but at a faster pace . at 125  myr ,",
    "the projected core radius @xmath86 was 3.1  pc , or 1.5 times larger than that of the present - day pleiades .",
    "similarly , the central surface density @xmath88 was a factor 0.58 lower .",
    "had we begun with very massive stars in an initial state a factor of 1.5 _ smaller _ than our standard one , a closer match would have resulted .",
    "these results were instructive , if somewhat academic .",
    "in reality , stars more massive than about @xmath139 would have inflated hii regions so quickly as to ionize and disperse the parent molecular cloud forming the pleiades . in order to retain even a remnant ,",
    "gravitationally bound cluster , the initial membership must have been very large , about 10,000 stars in the simulations of @xcite .",
    "we stress that even this figure is a lower bound , as @xcite assumed a star formation efficiency in the parent cloud of 33  percent by mass .",
    "such an efficiency is plausible within individual dense cores @xcite , but significantly higher than observational and theoretical estimates in cluster - forming clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "suppose we nevertheless adopt this scenario as a limiting case , and assume provisionally that the pleiades progenitor contained at least 10,000 individual stars .",
    "such groups are rare .",
    "equation  ( 39 ) of @xcite gives the birthrate of ob associations based on their population of supernova progenitors .",
    "if we use our adopted initial mass function to estimate this population , then the birthrate of relevant ob associations is .",
    "this is a factor between 5 and 8 smaller than the total formation rate of open clusters @xcite .",
    "it is unlikely , therefore , that formation through dispersing ob associations dominates , and we continue to use an upper mass limit of about @xmath139 for the pleiades .      the same calculations that reconstruct the past history of the pleiades may also be used to predict its development far into the future .",
    "it is still believed , following the original proposal by @xcite , that most open clusters are eventually destroyed by the tidal gravitational field of passing interstellar clouds , now identified as giant molecular complexes . in this project , we do not attempt to model encounters with such external bodies .",
    "however , starlab can follow the effects of the _ galactic _ tidal field , both through imposition of the appropriate external potential and by adding a coriolis force to individual systems .",
    "we switched on the galactic field , in addition to stellar evolution , and followed the cluster from its initial state for a total of 1  gyr .",
    "while most open clusters do not survive this long , some do last up to several gyr @xcite .",
    "our simulation thus models at least a portion of the pleiades future evolution .    up to the present cluster age of 125  myr , adding the galactic tidal field and stellar mass loss made very little difference in the evolution .",
    "beyond this point , the cluster will continue the overall expansion that characterized it in the past .",
    "as seen in figure  9 , the central density @xmath142 keeps declining .",
    "the falloff is roughly exponential , with an e - folding time of 400  myr .",
    "this figure , along with figures 10 and 11 , show average results from the 4 runs we conducted . even after averaging ,",
    "the calculated @xmath142 displays increasing scatter for . by this time",
    ", the _ total _ population has also fallen to the point that numerical determination of @xmath142 ( through a fitted king model ) becomes problematic .",
    "the decline in the cluster population , which was modest until the present , accelerates as stars are tidally stripped by the galactic gravitational field .",
    "it is the lighter stars that populate the cluster s outer halo and that preferentially escape .",
    "consequently , the average mass of the remaining cluster members rises .",
    "figure  10 shows both these trends .",
    "displayed here is @xmath76 , the number of systems contained within the initial jacobi radius of 14.3  pc . by 1  gyr , the total membership has fallen to a few dozen systems . meanwhile ,",
    "the average system mass @xmath143 rises , almost doubling by the end . careful inspection of figure  10 shows that @xmath143 initially fell slightly to its present - day value .",
    "this falloff reflects the loss , through stellar evolution , of the most massive members , an effect which is eventually overwhelmed by the escape of the lightest systems .",
    "notice again the jitter in the @xmath143 curve at later times .    despite this qualitative change in the cluster s internal constitution ,",
    "the degree of mass segregation remains essentially constant until very late times .",
    "figure  11 displays the gini coefficient . in detail",
    ", @xmath137 exhibits oscillations qualitatively similar to what we saw in lower portion of figure  8",
    ". nevertheless , its average magnitude does not appreciable change until , when it begins a steep descent . the very large scatter during this late epoch",
    "again reflects the diminishing population .    what accounts for these trends ?",
    "during most of the evolution , some process is able to enforce mass segregation , despite the continual depletion of the lightest members .",
    "this process evidently loses its efficacy at late times , when the total population falls too low .",
    "earlier , we showed that dynamical relaxation did _ not _ establish the present - day level of mass segregation .",
    "although we are now spanning a period well in excess of the initial relaxation time ( 250  myr ) , we still do not see the classic behavior - monotonic shrinking of the core that feeds halo expansion . up to",
    ", the projected core radius @xmath86 continues the increase noted earlier . between 200 and 600  myr ,",
    "when 75  percent of cluster members escape , @xmath86 does decline slightly , from 2.2 to 1.2  pc .",
    "thereafter , the core swells once more .",
    "we believe that the system s overall expansion is due principally to the release of energy in three - body encounters , specifically , close passages of binaries and single stars . over the gyr time span",
    ", mass loss through stellar evolution and tidal stripping weakens the cluster s gravitational binding , rendering it increasingly responsive to such internal heating .",
    "we ascribe the maintenance of mass segregation , i.e. , the inward drift of more massive stars , to dynamical friction with the background population .",
    "we shall revisit these key processes , binary heating and dynamical friction , momentarily .",
    "figure  12 shows graphically how the cluster will appear far in the future .",
    "here we show positions of the member systems projected into the galactic plane , both at the present time and at .",
    "one sees at present a slight elongation along the direction toward the galactic center .",
    "this tidal stretching is well documented observationally @xcite .",
    "stars that leave tend to do so along that direction .",
    "but any appreciable excursion leads , because of the galaxy s differential rotation , to a change in angular speed . as a result",
    ", two tidal streams develop that are orthogonal to the galactocentric radius .",
    "these streams are present in both panels of figure  12 , but are especially noticeable in the diminished cluster shown at the right .",
    "since we suspected that binaries were important in the gross dynamics of the cluster , we recalculated the entire 1  gyr evolution after effectively removing all primordial binaries from the system .",
    "we began with the same , best - fit initial state as before , which had the usual distribution of single - star masses and initial binary fraction .",
    "however , we replaced every binary by a single star , located at the system s center of mass and comprising the total of the component masses .",
    "in addition , we turned off both stellar evolution and the galactic tidal field , in order to explore the evolution under the simplest conditions possible .",
    "note that our procedure for fusing binaries into single stars preserved the total cluster mass , number of stellar systems , and mass distribution of those systems .",
    "in other words , all two - body interactions between cluster members were the same as before .",
    "the important difference is that we eliminated the source or sink of energy associated with the internal motion of binaries .",
    "the results were both surprising and illuminating .",
    "the cluster still undergoes overall expansion .",
    "figure  13 shows that the central density again falls steadily .",
    "the nominal e - folding time is again 400  myr , but the actual decline is not well fit by an exponential .",
    "the root cause of the cluster expansion is that _ new _ binaries continually form and interact with other stars .",
    "this process occurs principally near the relatively dense cluster center , where the most massive stars reside , along with other , more representative members .",
    "the component masses in the new binaries are high , typically @xmath144 .",
    "prompt formation of binaries is a well - documented occurrence in systems initially containing only single stars @xcite , and the formation rate is greatly enhanced at higher stellar mass @xcite . in our simulations ,",
    "only 3 or 4 of these systems exist at any time .",
    "nevertheless , they are significant dynamically , because of the cluster s relatively low gravitational binding .    any such massive binary with a separation less than is hard , i.e. , has a gravitational potential energy exceeding the initial mean kinetic energy of all cluster members .",
    "thus , even the relatively wide binaries formed in these simulations , with initial separations of order @xmath145  au , are capable of heating the cluster dynamically .",
    "as has long been appreciated @xcite , the encounter of a hard binary with a third star usually results in a harder ( tightened ) binary .",
    "both this pair and the isolated star have more translational kinetic energy than before . the extra energy , which comes at the expense of the binary s tightening , is quickly transferred to other cluster members .",
    "the same dynamical heating operates , of course , in all stellar groups containing binaries .",
    "however , very populous systems , such as globular clusters , have such high gravitational binding that almost all newly formed binaries are soft . in this case , energy exchange via three - body encounters has a minor effect , and the classical picture of dynamical relaxation via two - body encounters applies . in relatively sparse systems like open clusters ,",
    "both primordial and dynamically formed binaries inject so much energy that they impulsively change the velocity distribution function and qualitatively influence the course of evolution .",
    "this stochastic resetting of the velocities , which was emphasized in the classic study of @xcite , is a conspicuous feature of the pleiades evolution , both past and future .",
    "while undertaken primarily to reconstruct the history of the pleiades , our study has shed light on a well - documented , but still poorly understood , feature of open clusters generally - mass segregation .",
    "we demonstrated that the currrent , rather high degree of segregation in the pleiades could not have been the result of dynamical relaxation from a pristine state with homogeneous mass distribution .",
    "first , the cluster has only been evolving for about half its initial relaxation time .",
    "second , a hypothetical cluster starting with no mass segregation can not reach the present level .",
    "quantitatively , the gini coefficient rises , but not enough ( recall figure  9 ) .",
    "two conclusions may be drawn .",
    "the ancient pleiades must have already had substantial mass segregation before it drove off the gas .",
    "some other process , unrelated to dynamical relaxation , must drive this effect , and continues to do so long into the future ( figure  11 ) .",
    "the most obvious candidate is dynamical friction . a relatively massive star moving through a lower - mass population , experiences a drag force , causing it sink toward the cluster center .",
    "the associated time scale for braking , @xmath146 , can be substantially smaller than the dynamical relaxation time @xmath147 @xcite . according to @xcite , the quantitative relation is @xmath148 for a heavy star of mass @xmath11 in a background of average mass @xmath143 .",
    "@xcite and other researchers have invoked dynamical friction to explain mass segregation , focusing on very populous clusters in which massive star infall leads to the runaway growth of a central black hole ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "our work reveals a further , curious aspect of the phenomenon .",
    "figures  9 and 11 suggest , and further calculations confirm , that @xmath137 saturates , regardless of its initial value . why does the degree of mass segregation level off ?",
    "a possible explanation is that , as the most massive stars sink to the center , the population there becomes increasingly homogeneous .",
    "since @xmath149 rises , so does @xmath146 .",
    "in other words , mass segregation through dynamical friction may be a self - limiting process .",
    "returning to the prehistory of the pleiades , another significant finding is the relatively large size of the initial state .",
    "the virial radius @xmath28 began at 4  pc , while the projected half - mass radius of the initial cluster was about 2  pc .",
    "for comparison , the observed half - light radii of embedded clusters , as seen in the near infrared , range from about 0.5 to 1.0  pc , with some outliers on either side @xcite .",
    "thus , the initial , gas - free pleiades had a radius 2 to 4 times larger than typical embedded systems .",
    "it may plausibly be argued that the pleiades is an especially populous open cluster , and therefore began as a larger configuration , far outside the typical range . with this caveat in mind",
    ", our result suggests that the system expanded during its earliest , embedded phase .",
    "this swelling , which was accompanied , or even preceded , by mass segregation , could have been due to the loss of ambient gas during the formation process .",
    "interestingly , observations of extra - galactic clusters appear to show a similar , early expansion phase ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we have stressed the importance of binary heating to explain the global evolution of the pleiades , both past and future .",
    "this is a three - body effect , not considered in classical studies of dynamical relaxation . as we indicated , binary heating is more effective in less populous systems , including open clusters . in the near future ,",
    "we hope to explore further this general issue of stellar dynamics , i.e. , the demarcation between systems that do and do not undergo classical , dynamical relaxation .",
    "this study will necessarily delve further into the role of binaries .",
    "we also intend to repeat our pleiades analysis with another , relatively nearby system of comparable age , to ensure that the pleiades results are representative for the entire class of open clusters .",

    "their ratio is @xmath156 where we have used equations  ( a7 ) and ( 9 ) to make the last transformation . solving this equation for @xmath153 and substituting into equation  ( a3 ) , we find @xmath157    this last relation gives us more information about the virial radius .",
    "we now see that the nondimensional version , , obeys @xmath158 thus , @xmath159 can be obtained at once from the nondimensional solution . since @xmath28 itself is an input , the dimensional scale radius , @xmath22 , can be obtained from @xmath160 similarly , the central density @xmath19 is @xmath161 while @xmath20 is found from @xmath162",
    "let @xmath163 be the normalized distribution of single star masses . in the text",
    ", we used the same functional notation when referring to the mass distribution for the _ initial _ cluster ( see eq .",
    "we are now concerned with the _ evolved _ cluster .",
    "our assumed functional form will be different , but we retain the notation for simplicity .",
    "we again let @xmath63 be the binary mass correlation parameter , as in equation  ( 20 ) of the text .",
    "here we show how to find , for a given @xmath63 , the distribution of primary and secondary masses , as well as the distribution of the secondary - to - primary mass ratio @xmath82 .",
    "our final expressions for the various distributions are rather cumbersome and not especially illuminating ; we therefore limit ourselves to outlining the derivation for a generic single - star function @xmath163 .",
    "we first let the primary and secondary masses have provisional masses @xmath164 and @xmath165 , respectively .",
    "assume that both components within binaries are drawn independently from the same distribution @xmath163 .",
    "then the two - dimensional mass function of the binaries is @xmath166 here , @xmath167 is the probability of finding a system with primary mass between @xmath164 and @xmath168 , and secondary mass between @xmath165 and @xmath169 .",
    "this function is normalized so that @xmath170 as explained in  2.2 of paper  i , the initial factor of 2 on the righthand side of equation  ( b1 ) accounts for the different integration limits of @xmath171 and @xmath163 ( for the latter , see eq .  ( 19 ) ) .    to implement binary mass correlation",
    ", we consider new primary and secondary masses , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , related to the previous ones by @xmath172 we are interested in the distribution function , which is @xmath173 after evaluating the jacobian , we find @xmath174 \\,\\,.\\ ] ]    let us first consider @xmath175 , the distribution of primary masses .",
    "this function is the integral of @xmath176 over all appropriate values of @xmath60 : @xmath177 the largest mass a secondary can have , given the primary mass , is @xmath59 itself : @xmath178 however , the smallest mass is _ not _ @xmath179 .",
    "this is indeed the smallest mass for @xmath165 .",
    "the correlation of primary and secondary masses implies that the minimum for @xmath60 is @xmath180 thus , the two integration limits in equation  ( b7 ) are themselves functions of @xmath59 .    the secondary mass function , @xmath181 , is similarly found by integrating over all possible primary masses : @xmath182 the smallest value a primary mass can be , for a given secondary , is @xmath60 : @xmath183 somewhat surprisingly",
    ", the largest value is not necessarily @xmath184 , again because of the imposed correlation . to find the correct maximum , we solve equation  ( b4 ) for @xmath164 : @xmath185 since @xmath63 lies between 0 and 1 , the exponent of @xmath165 is negative .",
    "thus , for a given @xmath60 , @xmath59 is greatest when @xmath165 is smallest .",
    "since the lowest value of @xmath165 is @xmath179 , we have @xmath186 however , for , this equation says that , which is impossible . in summary , @xmath187 is given by @xmath188    finally , we need @xmath189 , the distribution of the binary mass ratio . as a first step ,",
    "we find the two - dimensional mass function .",
    "proceeding as before , we have @xmath190 \\,\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the desired distribution is the integral of over suitable @xmath59-values : @xmath191 as the notation indicates , the limits of @xmath59 are subject to the restriction of a fixed @xmath82 .",
    "now @xmath82 itself is given in terms of and @xmath165 by @xmath192 solving the last equation for @xmath59 gives @xmath193 since the exponent of @xmath82 is negative , and since @xmath82 itself lies between 0 and 1 , we see that .",
    "thus , for any @xmath82-value , there is always some @xmath165 for which .",
    "we therefore set @xmath194 the smallest value of @xmath59 corresponds to .",
    "it follows that @xmath195    we may , in principle , perform the integrals in equations  ( b7 ) , ( b10 ) , and ( b19 ) for any specified single - star function @xmath57 . in practice , we choose a lognormal : @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the normalization constant , and the variable @xmath52 is given by equation  ( 18 ) in the text . with this form of @xmath57 , the integrations may all be done analytically , although we do not reproduce the rather lengthy results here .",
