    "in the autumn of 1924 , the french physicist louis de broglie submitted to the judgement of sorbonne university in paris one of the most famous phd thesis in the history of physics @xcite .",
    "his results , as he confessed several decades later , gathered the fruits of many solitary meditations on a conundrum of physics which had bothered him for a long time : the dual wave and particle nature of light .",
    "his dissertation brought together various notes mainly published in the comptes rendus de the acadmie des sciences some months before , between 1923 and 1924 , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "de broglie s supervisor was the renowned physicist paul langevin @xcite .",
    "langevin sent a copy of de broglie s manuscript to his good friend einstein .",
    "einstein remained favourably impressed by the work , both for the courageous and innovative ideas contained in it and for the simple mathematics with which these were advanced .",
    "einstein probably also appreciated the important use of special relativity in de broglie s reasoning .",
    "the development of de broglie s thought , even confining ourselves to the phd thesis , is rather complex , and not without contradictory points @xcite . in this introduction",
    "we only recall some of its fundamental aspects , referring to the literature for the necessary details ( see , e.g. : @xcite- @xcite ) .    at the beginning of the 1920 s de broglie",
    "suggests that the quanta of light could be completely comparable to other known material particles .",
    "for instance , they had to share with those the property of having a rest mass different from zero , although very small @xcite . moreover , if the photons had to be put on the same conceptual framework of the other particles , it was natural to imagine that particles different from the photons could share with the light the strange dual nature of wave and corpuscle",
    ".    then the fundamental hypothesis of the french physicist was to consider true for all the particles , not only for the quanta of light , the planck - einstein law :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is a frequency and @xmath4 is the planck constant .",
    "but what is the physical origin of the frequency in the planck - einstein formula",
    "? he will remember some years after , at the conference by him delivered on the occasion of his receiving the nobel prize @xcite :    .2 cm    when i started to ponder these difficulties two things struck me in the main .",
    "firstly the light - quantum theory can not be regarded as satisfactory since it defines the energy of a light corpuscle by the relation @xmath5 which contains a frequency @xmath3 . now a purely corpuscular theory does not contain any element permitting the definition of a frequency .",
    "this reason alone renders it necessary in the case of light to introduce simultaneously the corpuscle concept and the concept of periodicity .    on the other hand",
    "the determination of the stable motions of the electrons in the atom involves whole numbers , and so far the only phenomena in which whole numbers were involved in physics were those of interference and of eigenvibrations .",
    "that suggested the idea to me that electrons themselves could not be represented as simple corpuscles either , but that a periodicity had also to be assigned to them too .",
    ".2 cm    de broglie initially imagines that the source of the frequency is related with some periodic phenomenon inside the particle @xcite .",
    "consider a particle with velocity @xmath6 along the @xmath7 axis in an inertial frame @xmath8 .",
    "assuming valid the combination of the planck - einstein equation for the photons ( [ planckeinstein0 ] ) and the relativistic energy of the particle ,    @xmath9    he writes that in the rest frame @xmath10 of the particle there must be :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the frequency of the supposed inner vibration .",
    "however , de broglie is immediately forced to face a problem . because of the relativistic time dilation , an observer , for whom the particle is moving with velocity @xmath6 , ascribes to the inner vibration a lower frequency @xmath13 :    @xmath14    however , comparing ( [ planckeinstein0 ] ) with ( [ einsteine ] ) :    @xmath15    and considering the condition ( [ db2 ] )",
    ", we easily obtain the relativistic formula of transformation between frequencies    @xmath16    which is typically linked with a wave phenomenon : @xmath3 is the frequency of a wave in @xmath8 , while @xmath17 is now the frequency of such a wave in the frame @xmath10 .    in order to resolve this difficulty , de broglie assumes the existence of a fictitious wave associated with the particle @xcite , with frequency @xmath3 and phase velocity    @xmath18    that is    @xmath19    ( the wave is fictitious because , according to the french physicist , being its speed greater than the speed of light , it can not transport energy ) . in order to justify the assumption in equation ( [ vfase ] )",
    ", he shows that if the periodic inner phenomenon and the external wave with phase velocity ( [ vfase ] ) are in phase at a given time , they will be always in phase ; i.e. the particle moves within the wave maintaining its inner vibration in phase with the wave .",
    "de broglie called that law of the harmony of phases .",
    "his result , according to de broglie , suggests that any moving body could be accompanied by a wave , and it is impossible to disjoin the motion of the body from the wave propagation @xcite .",
    "therefore , he assumes that @xmath3 is the frequency of a plane wave which accompanies the particle , and that this frequency is the same which is in the planck - einstein equation .",
    "let us recall the relativistic momentum of the particle :    @xmath20    by comparing ( [ impulsor ] ) with ( [ planckeinstein0einsteine ] ) and assuming that this holds in any frame , we may write the momentum in terms of the wave frequency :    @xmath21    but from ( [ vevfase ] ) we know that @xmath22 , and remembering that for a monochromatic wave the wavelength is @xmath23 , from ( [ impulsofreq ] ) we have the formula that made de broglie famous :    @xmath24    equation ( [ db1 ] ) connects the module of the momentum @xmath25 of a particle with the wavelength @xmath26 of the associated plane wave through the planck constant @xmath4 .",
    "( for historical precision , we have to say that de broglie expressly writes ( [ db1 ] ) only in the last chapter of his ph.d .",
    "thesis , in the form @xmath27 . in all his preceding works ,",
    "the treatment of the bohr atom included , he always reasons in terms of frequency ) .    in his second memoir on the comptes",
    "rendus @xcite de broglie suggests an experimental verification of his ideas .",
    "the wave is conceived as a kind of field that guides the behavior of the particle .",
    "the new dynamics of particles , which he plans to develop , would be to the old classic dynamics as the wave optics is to the geometric optics . according to the author :",
    ".2 cm the new principle of dynamics would explain the diffraction of light atoms ( _ the photons _ ) , no matter how small their number .",
    "moreover , any body in certain cases would be subject to diffraction .",
    "a stream of electrons through an opening sufficiently small would show some phenomena of diffraction .",
    "it is in this direction that we must look for experimental confirmation of our ideas .",
    ".2 cm    de broglie s prediction on the wave nature of the electron , the reason for his nobel prize , will be confirmed a few years later in the experiments of davisson , germer @xcite and thomson @xcite on the diffraction of electrons by crystals @xcite .    today",
    "just a few introductory textbooks to quantum theory describe the original way of de broglie s thinking .",
    "some books contain simplified versions @xcite , @xcite ; most of them simply cite equation ( [ db1 ] ) as a postulate , and its application in the deduction of the energy quantization in bohr s atom model @xcite , @xcite .",
    "perhaps , from the present perspective , many of de broglie s initial suppositions appear strange ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "however , rejecting entirely the reasoning of the french physicist , and ignoring completely the history of his formula , means also missing the relativistic argument , which underlines from the beginning how quantum mechanics is related to special relativity ( without having to wait for the dirac equation , with his description of spin and prediction of antimatter ) .",
    "this is a pity , as the power to unify different descriptions of the phenomena is one of the more interesting sides of the physics .",
    "in the next section we report an alternative deduction of the de broglie relation obtained directly from lorentz transformations and planck - einstein equation . in section 3 ,",
    "following de broglie , ashby , miller @xcite and reed @xcite , we show how special relativity puts constraints on the possible formulas that may connect energy and momentum of a particle with the wavelength , the frequency and the wave amplitude .",
    "we demonstrate in general that equations like de broglie s and planck - einstein s are both the only relations allowed by special relativity , once we assume the existence of a dependency between the four - momentum of a particle and the wave four - vector of a plane wave and that the particle can not be separated by its wave .",
    "for particles without rest mass ( @xmath28 ) such as photons , deducing the de broglie relation from the planck - einstein equation is straightforward . in fact , following einstein @xcite , it is enough to consider the relativistic equation between momentum and energy :    @xmath29    putting @xmath5 in ( @xmath30 ) and recalling that @xmath31 , we quickly obtain ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "an elegant way to derive the de broglie relation , for any massive or massless particle , can be achieved using directly lorentz transformations @xcite .",
    "we put forward the following assumptions :    .3 cm    * postulate 1.a * : each particle is associated with a wave phenomenon .",
    ".2 cm    * postulate 2.a * : in every inertial frame the relation @xmath1 holds , where @xmath33 is the energy of the particle , @xmath34 is the frequency of the associated wave in that frame and @xmath35 is a relativistically invariant constant .",
    ".3 cm    we want to show that :    .3 cm * theorem a * : according to special relativity and the postulates 1.a-2.a , between the momentum and the wave vector there is necessarily the relation @xmath36 .",
    ".4 cm    let @xmath8 and @xmath37 be two inertial frames in relative motion . according to postulate 2.a",
    ", we assume that in both frames the planck - einstein relation applies to any particle :    @xmath38    we introduce , for the particle and the wave , the four - momentum @xmath39 and the wave four - vector @xmath40 , respectively :    @xmath41    where the wave vector @xmath42 has modulus @xmath43 .",
    "we assume , for simplicity , that the frames @xmath8 and @xmath37 have parallel axes to each other and that at time @xmath44 the origins @xmath45 and @xmath46 of the spatial coordinates coincide . moreover , we suppose @xmath37 to move with respect to @xmath8 with speed @xmath47 along the direction of the @xmath48 axis , and the direction of the wave propagation to be along such axis ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    , we choose our inertial frame @xmath8 with the @xmath48-axis coinciding with the direction of the wave vector , so that @xmath49 .",
    "the figure schematically shows some fronts of the plane wave .",
    "@xmath37 is the inertial frame travelling with velocity @xmath50 in comparison with @xmath8.,width=302 ]    the lorentz transformations for the four - momentum and the wave four - vector are    @xmath51    where    @xmath52    we have    @xmath53    by multiplying the second of ( @xmath54 ) for the planck constant @xmath55 :    @xmath56    subtracting side by side the two equations @xmath57 :    @xmath58    from which , because of ( @xmath59 ) assumed at the beginning , we get    @xmath60    if we exclude the trivial condition in which the relative velocity @xmath50 of the frames is zero ( in such case the factor @xmath61 is also zero and the two systems @xmath8 and @xmath37 coincide ) , equation ( @xmath62 ) is only satisfied with    @xmath63    equivalent to the de broglie equation for the @xmath64 component of the momentum .",
    "we point out as the just given demonstration , with postulate 2.a , holds for particles of any mass , while de broglie s demonstration , starting from the relation ( [ impulsor ] ) , only holds for particles with nonzero rest mass .",
    "equation ( [ tl5 ] ) can be easily generalized to the other components of momentum and wave vector .",
    "in fact , consider a general orientation of the wave vector @xmath65 with respect to the @xmath8 frame @xmath66 .",
    "we may use inertial frames @xmath67 and @xmath68 that travel with velocities along @xmath69 and @xmath70 with respects to @xmath8 . applying the correspondent relations of ( [ tleo ] ) for @xmath67 and @xmath68 with the pairs of components @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , @xmath74 we have at once :    @xmath75",
    "the presented deduction can be applied also to other pairs of four - vectors in order to show that , if a proportionality relation holds between two components of two four - vectors , then the proportionality must also hold for the other components .",
    "that is , given two generic four - vectors @xmath76 and @xmath77 , if it is @xmath78 , necessarily from lorentz transformations it has to be @xmath79 , and vice versa .",
    "let us consider , as an example , the four - momentum @xmath80 and the four - velocity @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "assuming a law of proportionality between @xmath84 and @xmath85 through an invariant @xmath86 with the dimension of a mass , @xmath87 , and arguing in a similar way as reported just above , we can show that @xmath88 , equivalent to the famous einstein formula @xmath89 , with @xmath90 .",
    "as already remarked by einstein in one of his fundamental works of 1905 , the energy of an electromagnetic radiation contained in a closed surface , and the frequency of the same radiation , change under lorentz transformations in the same way @xcite .    as pointed out by ashby and miller @xcite , the energy of a massless particle and the frequency of an electromagnetic wave change under transformations in a similar way .",
    "let s consider , in fact , once again ( @xmath54 ) . by placing in the first @xmath91 and in the second @xmath92 ,",
    "we have    @xmath93    we get from the previous relations and recalling the definitions ( @xmath94 ) of the factors @xmath95 and @xmath96 :    @xmath97    according to ashby and miller the simultaneous validity of ( @xmath98 ) gives strong constraints on the possible forms that a relation between the energy of a photon and the frequency of a wave may have .",
    "in fact , these authors assume , ab absurdo , @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is in general different from 1 and @xmath101 is an invariant constant .",
    "they show that the planck - einstein relation , which is obtained with @xmath102 , is the only kind of dependence between energy and frequency which is relativistically invariant .",
    "it would seem , from the developed reasoning in section 2 and from the ashby and miller result , that , at least for the photons , both planck - einstein and de broglie equations may follow from special relativity .",
    "then we wonder if a general constraint exists , which is valid for particles with any mass , for which the condition of relativistic invariance imposes the form of both planck - einstein and de broglie relations .    as a matter of fact , in a",
    "not well known work , reed ( 1991 ) has shown that , if we identify the velocity of a massive particle with the group velocity of a wave packet , between the four - momentum of the particle and the mean of the wave four - vector there is a relation of proportionality @xcite .",
    "so reed has deduced together two relations which are similar to de broglie s and planck - einstein s .",
    "however , his demonstration suffers from some defects .",
    "in particular , the fact that in quantum mechanics a wave packet is associated with a statistical ensemble of particles which have a dispersion of the values of the momentum ; while a particle with a well definite momentum does not correspond to a wave packet , but to a monochromatic wave function @xcite .    here , we intend to show that even between the determinate four - momentum of a particle and the wave four - vector of a monochromatic wave there must be a condition of direct proportionality .",
    "our initial hypotheses will be more general in comparison with reed s .",
    "moreover , differently from reed , we shall consider particles with and without inertial mass .",
    "we assume from experience that every particle is in relation with a wave @xcite .",
    "we make no assumptions about the specific nature of this wave , ( still a controversial issue after almost a century @xcite ) or on the type of differential equation it may have : the dalembert wave equation , or schrdinger s , or klein - gordon s , or dirac s , or more .",
    "we suppose only that a perturbation of an unclear kind , describable as a plane wave with definite wave number and frequency , is associated with a corpuscole and with the finite energy and the finite momentum of it .",
    "we recall that in classical mechanics a plane wave possesses infinite total momentum and infinite total energy , and then we can only define for it a flux and a density of momentum , or a flux and a density of energy @xcite , so our assumption , that we may call quantistic is in contrast with classical mechanics .",
    "we consider as previously , for sake of simplicity , a plane wave of angular frequency @xmath103 travelling with wave vector @xmath42 along the @xmath48 positive direction of an inertial frame @xmath8 .",
    "all our results will be generalizable for @xmath42 with generic direction with respect to @xmath8 following the way sets out at the end of section 2 .    in @xmath8 , @xmath104 and because of lorentz transformation ( @xmath105 ) of the wave four - vector , the @xmath106 and @xmath107 components of @xmath108 will be always zero also in any other inertial reference @xmath37",
    ". therefore we will look for the expressions of @xmath33 and @xmath109 only as functions of @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "in fact , since we assume that no force acts on our system , the energy and the momentum depend neither from the spatial coordinate @xmath112 nor from the time @xmath113 .",
    "let us denote with @xmath114 a generic amplitude of the wave ( without defining whether it is a scalar , a four - vector or other ) .",
    "we assume the following postulates :    .3 cm    * postulate 1.b * : each particle is associated with a wave and it is impossible to disjoin the motion of the particle from its wave .",
    ".2 cm    * postulate 2.b * : the finite energy and momentum of a free particle are associated with the characteristics of a monochromatic plane wave , amplitude , frequency and wave vector :    @xmath115    we intend to show :    .2 cm * theorem b * : the only functions ( [ inv1b ] ) allowed by special relativity and by postulates 1.b-2.b , are the relations of proportionality @xmath116 and @xmath117 , where @xmath101 is a relativistic invariant . .3",
    "cm    .2 cm    for the development of theorem b we need the following lemma :    .2 cm    * lemma * : in accordance with the adopted postulates , if in a frame @xmath10 the momentum of the particle is zero , @xmath118 , then in that same frame the wave vector must be zero as well , @xmath119 , and vice versa .",
    ".2 cm    according to our postulates , if the particle is somehow connected to its wave , the momentum has to flow in the direction of the wave propagation ( in conformity with what happens to waves in classical mechanics ) .",
    "in fact , consider an emitted particle by a source placed at the point @xmath114 and absorbed by a detector at the point @xmath120 : in such a situation there is a propagation and a transfer of momentum between the source and the detector .",
    "now imagine the ideal monochromatic wave as the limit case of a wave train with a broad but finite length , by letting its length to grow to infinity , and consequently increasing the distance between points @xmath114 and @xmath120 .",
    "if the momentum is linked with the particle , the particle with the wave , and the wave train must be emitted with the particle , then the detected momentum must propagate in the direction of propagation of the wave train , from @xmath114 to @xmath120 : if @xmath121 there is even @xmath122 , if @xmath123 we have @xmath124 , and vice versa :    @xmath125    we require that such a condition holds in every inertial system @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath10 be the frame in which the momentum of the particle is zero ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "lorentz transformations between the two inertial frames @xmath8 and @xmath10 for the components of the momentum and the wave vector are :    @xmath127    where now we have represented in explicit form the dependence of @xmath95 on the @xmath128 velocity of @xmath10 , coincident with the rest frame of the particle ( hence @xmath128 is also the velocity of the particle with respect to @xmath8 ) .",
    "the sign of @xmath129 only depends on the sign of @xmath128 ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "therefore the condition ( [ onetoone ] ) is satisfied if , and only if , in @xmath10 is @xmath131 .",
    "it is easy to understand from ( [ onetoone ] ) and lorentz transformations that , in general , there must be :    @xmath132    so , assuming that the momentum ( i.e. , the velocity of the particle ) is always in the direction of the wave propagation , it is equivalent to assuming the existence of a frame in which momentum and wave vector are both zero : the frame where the classical particle is at rest is also the frame where the wave is stationary , ( a special kind of stationary wave , with wavelength infinite ) .",
    ".2 cm    let us look for the velocity of the frame where the wave is stationary in function of @xmath103 and @xmath111 .",
    "putting @xmath131 into the inverse of the second transformation in ( [ tlqpqkbos0 ] ) ,    @xmath133    we get immediately :    @xmath134    remembering that the phase velocity is defined as @xmath135 , from ( [ tlkoinb ] ) we have    @xmath136    equation ( [ vxvp ] ) is exactly equivalent to ( [ vevfase ] ) , postulated by de broglie in order to obtain the harmony of phases between the periodic inner phenomenon and the external wave . from equation ( [ vxvp ] ) ,",
    "being the velocity of the particle @xmath137 , we see that the phase velocity of the associated wave has to be @xmath138 , ( where the sign of equality applies only to massless particles . ) .",
    ".6 cm coming back to theorem b , we consider the two invariants square moduli of the four - momentum and the wave four - vector :    @xmath139    where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are , respectively , the energy @xmath142 and the frequency in the frames where the momentum and the wave vector are zero .",
    "we study the four different possible cases :    .8 cm    _ case 1 : @xmath143 , @xmath144 . _",

    "then we can introduce the invariant @xmath101 :    @xmath149    where @xmath101 is for the initial hypotheses finite , positive and constant with respect to the space - time coordinates @xmath150 .    by confronting ( [ invcoo ] ) with ( [ rapeoo ] )",

    "in general :    @xmath153    however , if we require , according the postulate 2.b and the first of equations ( [ rapeoo ] ) , that in the limit @xmath154 the invariant @xmath101 is finite and different from zero , from ( [ invc000 ] ) it must necessarily be also @xmath155 ( we will analyze the case @xmath28 and @xmath156 below ) . this claim implies the existence of a dependence between @xmath141 and @xmath86 , @xmath157 .",
    "so , in this circumstance , @xmath101 can only depend on the mass , @xmath158 , and the invariant is constant for that particle .",

    "moreover , @xmath180 and @xmath184 can be replaced by another assumption :        the fact that the particle is at rest in frame where @xmath188 is a situation rather arbitrary , which de broglie justifies with his phase harmony theorem .",
    "but as we have shown in our work , it follows from relativity itself , when we make the quite natural and classical assumption that wave and momentum travel in same direction .",

    "<S> we show how special relativity sets tight constraints on the form of possible relations that may exist between the four - momentum of a particle and the wave four - vector . more specifically , we demonstrate that there is just one way , according to special relativity , to relate the finite energy and momentum of a corpuscle with the characteristics of a plane wave , frequency , wave vector and amplitude : that is by laws of direct proportionality like de broglie equation @xmath0 and planck - einstein equation @xmath1 . </S>"
