    "we have previously considered  @xcite a simple extension of the standard model ( sm ) with an enriched neutral fermion spectrum consisting a of massless neutrino and a dirac neutral heavy lepton ( nhl ) associated with each generation  @xcite . in @xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath3 colliders , these nhl s can be pair produced or produced singly in association with a massless neutrino  @xcite .",
    "the kinematic reach in nhl mass of the latter process exceeds that of the former so we consider only the single nhl production here .",
    "the model which we consider here includes two new weak isosinglet neutrino fields per generation . imposing total lepton number conservation and diagonalizing the mass matrix yields three massless neutrinos ( @xmath4 ) along with three dirac nhl s ( @xmath5 ) of mass @xmath6 .",
    "the weak interaction eigenstates ( @xmath7 ) are related to the six mass eigenstates via a @xmath8 mixing matrix @xmath9 : @xmath10 various combinations of the mixing matrix parameters arise .",
    "the mixing factor which typically governs flavour - conserving processes , @xmath11 , is given by @xmath12 [ c ] { } l= e , \\mu , \\tau\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the flavour - violating mixing factor @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 [ c ] { } l \\neq l^{'}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] further , the following inequality holds @xmath15 [ c ] { } l \\neq l^{'}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we choose from the above the parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 to characterize the model , while neglecting the flavour violating parameters , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the inequality above implies this could be reasonable and , also , we note that the parameter @xmath19 is the most tightly constrained by experiment . the existing constraints are  @xcite @xmath22 and  @xcite @xmath23 the best constraints on the mixings @xmath20 and @xmath21 arise from the inequality above and are not particularly strong .",
    "we consider below the production , in @xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath3 colliders , of a single nhl along with a massless neutrino , parametrized by the nhl mass , @xmath6 , and the mixings @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we discuss the nhl decay and , hence , the potential signatures for the process ; in particular we focus on the signature whereby the nhl can be fully reconstructed .",
    "we estimate the limits on @xmath6 and the mixings which can be reached for various machine parameters .",
    "we here consider only nhl s with mass greater than @xmath24 and @xmath25 , given the absence of experimental evidence for the production of nhl s as decay products of @xmath26 and @xmath27 bosons @xcite .",
    "the production of a single nhl , @xmath5 , in association with a massless neutrino , @xmath4 , proceeds via the two diagrams of figure [ fig1 ] . in the context of the model described in the last section , this process",
    "is determined by the following terms of the lagrangian .",
    "@xmath28    the resulting cross section for single nhl production , @xmath29 , is given below .",

    "also , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the coefficients of the t - channel @xmath26 exchange , the s- channel @xmath27 exchange , and the interference , namely , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , depend on the entries in the mixing matrix @xmath9 . in terms of the parameters",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , they are limited as follows .",
    "@xmath39    the single nhl production cross sections are displayed as a function of nhl mass @xmath6 in figures [ fig2],[fig3 ] for the various machine parameters of the snowmass study . in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , the lower energy machine results are given .",
    "these include @xmath0 @xmath1 colliders with @xmath40 , 1.0 , and 1.5 tev and a @xmath2 @xmath3 collider of @xmath40 tev .",
    "the proposed integrated luminosities for these machines are 50 , 200 , and 200 @xmath41 for the three @xmath42 @xmath43 collider options , respectively , and either 7 or 50 @xmath41 for the muon collider . in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , the results for the high energy options , a 5 tev @xmath0 @xmath1 collider and a 4 tev @xmath2 @xmath3 collider , are displayed .",
    "for each of these options the proposed integrated luminosity is 1000 @xmath41 .",
    "hence , one can expect tens of thousands of signal events for a large range of @xmath44 . in these figures , the mixing parameters used are those quoted in equation  [ eq : limits1 ] , namely , the present experimental limits , so these results should be considered upper limits .",
    "note , in the @xmath0 @xmath1 case the coefficient @xmath45 multiplies the t - channel and s - t channel interference terms , whereas in the @xmath2 @xmath3 collider case , these terms come in with the coefficient @xmath46 . note also that these results should be multiplied by a factor of two to include the conjugate process as well , @xmath47 .",
    "the t - channel @xmath26 exchange diagram of figure [ fig1 ] is by far the dominant one relative to the s - channel @xmath27 diagram .",
    "hence , the production cross section for the @xmath2 @xmath3 collider scales approximately from that of the @xmath0 @xmath1 collider as @xmath48 .",
    "because of this t - channel dominance any of our results can be easily scaled to smaller mixing parameters , to a good approximation.similarly , the overall @xmath6 dependent factor of this t - channel term , @xmath49 $ ] , provides the approximate scaling with @xmath6 .",
    "we must consider the possible decay modes of the nhl @xcite . for nhl mass large relative to the @xmath26 and @xmath27 masses , the nhl will decay into a light lepton ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) and a gauge boson ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) which subsequently also decays .",
    "if a higgs boson is kinematically accessible , the nhl can also decay into a massless neutrino along with the higgs boson .",
    "table [ tab : brs ] shows the branching ratios into these modes in the two cases that a @xmath52 is or is not kinematically accessible .    [ cols=\">,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the resulting signatures for the single nhl production are also shown in the table ; it should be understood that in each case one also has missing energy and momentum due to the undetected @xmath50 ( s ) as part of the signature .",
    "the distribution among the particular final state lepton flavours is dictated by the details of the mixing parameters in the matrix @xmath53 , whereas it is the combinations @xmath11 and @xmath54 which are constrained by experiment .",
    "hence the signatures for the nhl production should be understood to include all lepton flavours in an unspecified distribution .",
    "the subscripts @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath55 indicate the appropriate invariant mass of the observed particles . in the case of the nhl decay @xmath56 with the subsequent hadronic decay of the @xmath26",
    ", the nhl mass can be fully reconstructed .",
    "hence we focus on this signature .    in an earlier study  @xcite on single nhl production at a 500 @xmath57 @xmath42 @xmath43 collider ,",
    "only events in which the @xmath26 decayed leptonically were considered . in that case , the signature is a pair of energetic charged leptons with a small opening angle .",
    "backgrounds include single @xmath26 and @xmath26 pair production , with the @xmath26 s decaying leptonically .",
    "therein , a set of cuts which rejected the @xmath26 pair background at the level of about 99.4% was implemented .",
    "it was also argued that the single @xmath26 production was controllable . for an integrated luminosity of 20 @xmath41 , they expected sensitivity to nhl mass up to @xmath58 for a t - channel mixing factor of @xmath59 and for a 300 @xmath57 nhl , they estimated a sensitivity down to @xmath36 of @xmath60 .",
    "those results were encouraging .",
    "however , the use of the events in which the @xmath26 decays hadronically to boost the statistics and also to reconstruct the nhl mass will extend the possible discovery limits .",
    "the branching ratio for nhl decay to this mode ranges from @xmath61 to @xmath62 with an extra factor of @xmath62 for the branching ratio of the @xmath26 into its hadronic decay mode .",
    "backgrounds competing with this lepton , two - jet , missing momentum signal include single @xmath26 production followed by hadronic decay of the @xmath26 , @xmath26 pair production with one @xmath26 decaying hadronically and the other leptonically , and also the two photon process @xmath63 , where one of the leptons is undetected . here",
    "also , there has been a study comparing this signature and its backgrounds for the case of a 500 @xmath57 @xmath42 @xmath43 collider  @xcite , with @xmath64 .",
    "a set of cuts was determined which effectively lowers the background rate while maintaining most of the signal ; the distribution in @xmath65 invariant mass was then used to distinguish the @xmath66 peak about the nhl mass from the background .",
    "the cuts include demanding one and only one charged lepton , which eliminates much of the single @xmath26 production background as the accompanying charged lepton is likely to go along the beam pipe in that process .",
    "also , the @xmath67 invariant mass must reconstruct to the @xmath26 mass , within some resolution . because the nhl can be fully reconstructed , so can the missing @xmath50 momentum .",
    "the remaining cuts , which are fully described in  @xcite , include constraints involving the missing momemtum and the reconstructed nhl . in their example of @xmath68 and @xmath6 = 350 @xmath57 ,",
    "while the signal rate is reduced by the cuts by a factor of 0.85 , the single @xmath26 rate is reduced by a factor of @xmath69 and the @xmath26 pair rate by a factor @xmath70 .",
    "the two photon rate was reduced to unobservability on imposition of the cuts .",
    "they find , for @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) , sensitivity up to @xmath6 = 450 @xmath57.this particular result is based on about 175 events ( before b.r.s and cuts ) for an integrated luminosity of 20 @xmath41 . for @xmath6 of 350 @xmath57 , they estimate sensitivity to a mixing down to @xmath73 of about 0.005 ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "this result is based on just over 20 events for the same luminosity .",
    "we do not present a detailed comparison of the nhl signal and its backgrounds here .",
    "rather we make some estimates based on the results quoted above for the case of the 500 @xmath57 @xmath42 @xmath43 collider .",
    "the cross section for single nhl production asymptotically approaches a constant value with increasing @xmath75 . on the other hand , beyond threshold ,",
    "the @xmath26 pair production cross section falls as @xmath75 increases .",
    "the kinematic nature of these processes does not change with increasing @xmath75 so the cuts implemented in  @xcite will remain effective . hence the @xmath26 pair background will not be a problem for @xmath76 beyond 500 @xmath57 .",
    "similarly , the two photon process is under control .",
    "however , the single @xmath26 production ( @xmath77 ) cross section also rises asymptotically to a constant value as @xmath75 increases .",
    "hence , this process remains the limiting background for the higher energy colliders but the cuts should be effective in reducing this source of background .",
    "we assume , then , that the backgrounds can be controlled .",
    "this must be confirmed by detailed study and so we present only estimates of discovery limits .",
    "given that the detailed study of azuelos and djouadi  @xcite based their discovery limits on rates , before b.r.s and cuts , of the order of 100 events , we use this number of events to determine our discovery limits for the higher energy machines .",
    "if we assume the mixings take the values in eq .",
    "[ eq : limits1 ] , the reach in nhl mass approaches the kinematic limit for each of the high energy colliders .",
    "for some other representative values of nhl mass , we show in table [ tab : disclim ] , approximate limits in mixing @xmath36 , for the case @xmath78 , for the various machine energies and proposed integrated luminosities .",
    "these limits are based on the cross section ( multiplied by a factor of 2 to include the conjugate process ) given in eq .",
    "[ eq : xsecn ] . using the t - channel dominance and @xmath79",
    ", we can further simplify eq .",
    "[ eq : xsecn ] to obtain the following approximation for @xmath36 : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the number of events ( 100 ) and @xmath82 is the integrated luminosity . for a large interval of @xmath6 , also the logarithmic term of @xmath83 can be neglected .",
    "the results of table [ tab : disclim ] thus indicate that the higher energy colliders will be sensitive to mixings in the range @xmath84 down to @xmath85 over a large range of nhl masses , @xmath6 .",
    "llll @xmath76 ( @xmath86 ) & @xmath87 ( @xmath41 ) & @xmath6 ( @xmath86 ) & @xmath36 + 1.0 & 200 & 0.5 & @xmath88 + & & 0.75 & @xmath60 + & & 0.95 & @xmath89 + 1.5 & 200 & 0.5 & @xmath90 + & & 1.0 & @xmath91 + & & 1.25 & @xmath92 + & & 1.45 & @xmath93 + 4.0 & 1000 & 0.5 & @xmath94 + & & 1.0 & @xmath85 + & & 2.0 & @xmath95 + 5.0 & & 0.5 & @xmath96 + & & 1.0 & @xmath97 + & & 2.0 & @xmath98 +   +",
    "we have investigated the production in @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath99 @xmath100 colliders of a single nhl along with a massless neutrino , for collider energies ranging from 500 @xmath57 to 5 @xmath86 .",
    "the production rates depend on nhl mass , @xmath6 , and mixings . for the current limits on mixings ,",
    "each of the electron colliders is sensitive to values of @xmath6 approaching the kinematic limit .",
    "the 500 @xmath57 muon collider is less sensitive because the relevant mixing , @xmath101 , is tightly constrained . for values of @xmath6 below the kinematic limit ,",
    "the various colliders are sensitive to mixings in the range @xmath102 to @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the process of single nhl production in lepton colliders is very promising for the possible discovery of the nhl s .",
