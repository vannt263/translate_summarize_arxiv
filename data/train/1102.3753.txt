    "are not yet established in theoretical calculations .",
    "the sign problem makes the lattice monte carlo simulation difficult in the large baryon - chemical potential ( @xmath2 ) region  @xcite , the strong coupling expansion of lattice qcd  @xcite is not yet reliable to describe the real world , and the predictions in effective models are spread in the @xmath3 plane  @xcite .",
    "thus further experimental and theoretical developments are necessary to reveal the properties of cp .",
    "the search for cp in heavy ion collisions is ongoing in the beam energy scan programs at rhic  @xcite , and cp is one of the most important targets in the forthcoming fair facility .",
    "the most characteristic feature of cp is the divergence of the coherence length @xmath4 .",
    "the phase transition becomes the second order , and large fluctuations of the order parameters are expected in a volume of the size @xmath5 . on the basis of this idea , various signatures of cp have been suggested theoretically  @xcite .",
    "however , since the system size and the evolution time are limited , it is not an easy task to observe the divergence signature of @xmath4 in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "in addition , if the baryon chemical potential of cp ( @xmath6 ) is above 500 mev , cp may not be reachable in heavy - ion collisions . therefore , it is important to examine other candidate sites where hot and dense matter is formed and cp is reachable",
    ".    a gravitational collapse of a massive star may be one of the promising candidates for the cp hunting .",
    "it has been argued that the transition to quark matter might trigger the second collapse and bang in supernova explosions  @xcite .",
    "recent calculation suggests that the qcd phase transition may take place during the core - collapse of a star with @xmath7 when one uses the relativistic equation of state ( shen eos )  @xcite combined with the bag model eos at high @xmath8 or @xmath9 for a small bag constant , @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the qcd phase transition leads to the second shock , and is suggested to give successful supernova explosion even in a simulation with spherical symmetry .",
    "non - rotating massive stars with mass @xmath11 are expected to collapse without supernova explosions and to form a black hole ( bh )  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the bh formation processes are calculated by using the neutrino - radiation hydrodynamical simulations in general relativity . in the collapse and bounce stage of a 40@xmath12 star ,",
    "the core bounce launches the shock wave , but the shock wave stalls due to the collisions with falling matter ( accretion ) and goes down to the surface of the compact object .",
    "the proto - neutron star is born at center and gradually contracts .",
    "because of the accretion , the proto - neutron star mass increases rapidly and reaches the critical mass .",
    "the dynamical collapse occurs again at this point and the bh is formed at 1.3 s after the bounce in the case of the shen eos  @xcite .",
    "if we adopt a relativistic eos with hyperons ( ishizuka eos )  @xcite or the lattimer - swesty eos  @xcite , the second collapse becomes more rapid ( @xmath13 0.7 s after the bounce ) , while the average neutrino energies are lower with ishizuka eos  @xcite .",
    "the combination of the neutrino duration time and the neutrino energy may be used as a signal of the hyperon emergence or other new degrees of freedom during the bh formation  @xcite .    during the bh formation , hot @xmath14 and dense @xmath15 matter is created .",
    "the temperature and density in bh formation are significantly higher than those in the model explosion calculation of supernova , where the highest temperature and density are @xmath16  @xcite . in hotter and denser environment during bh formation compared with the supernova explosions",
    ", we have a larger possibility of creating a new form of matter , such as the dense quark matter .",
    "thermodynamical variables at a given time vary as a function of radius in a proto - neutron star and form a line in the @xmath3 plane .",
    "this thermodynamical line , referred to as the bh formation profile in the later discussions , evolves with time and may pass through cp and the vicinity .",
    "we call here this situation as the _",
    "cp sweep_.    in this letter , we examine the location of the qcd phase boundary and cp in two - flavor chiral effective models at finite isospin chemical potential @xmath17 , and discuss the possibility of the cp sweep during the bh formation from a gravitational collapse of a massive star .",
    "first , we compute the cp location in the @xmath3 plane in chiral effective models such as the nambu - jona lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite , the polyakov loop extended nambu - jona - lasino ( p - njl ) model  @xcite , p - njl model with eight - quark interaction  @xcite , and the polyakov loop extended quark - meson ( pqm ) model  @xcite .",
    "the bag model eos adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite is not suited to the present purpose , since it does not have cp . in the dynamical bh formation",
    ", we have abundant neutrinos , and approximate @xmath18 equilibrium including neutrinos are realized inside the neutrino sphere , @xmath19 , while neutrinos are out of equilibrium outside . in both cases ,",
    "it is necessary to take account of finite isospin chemical potential @xmath20 as another independent thermodynamical variable  @xcite , rather than imposing the neutrino - less @xmath18 equilibrium condition ( @xmath21 ) in order to examine the cp property during the bh formation . recently ,",
    "p - njl model with isospin chemical potential has been investigated with  @xcite and without  @xcite neutrino - less @xmath18 equilibrium conditions . at finite @xmath20",
    ", we naively expect that cp moves in the lower @xmath8 direction because of the larger @xmath22-quark chemical potential @xmath23 .",
    "since the matter passes through the high @xmath2 and low @xmath8 region , the reduction of the cp temperature @xmath24 is essential for the cp sweep during the bh formation .",
    "next , we compare the results of the cp location in the chiral effective models with the evolution of thermodynamical variables @xmath25 during the bh formation obtained in ref .  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that we compare the results of the cp location in chiral effective models and the thermodynamical condition @xmath26 calculated with the hadronic eos .",
    "this comparison is relevant , since the thermal trajectory should be the same even if we use the combined eos of quark and hadronic matter , as long as the hadronic eos is reproduced at low @xmath8 and @xmath2 in the combined eos .",

    "the density and temperature at the core bounce are @xmath166 at center .",
    "the baryon chemical potential and temperature do not reach the phase transition region in this case .",
    "they do not rise enough during the stage of the stalled shock wave for 200 ms after the core bounce .",
    "therefore , it is not likely to have the cp sweep in dense matter around the core bounce for successful explosions .",
    "the situation is similar in the numerical result of adiabatic collapse and bounce of the 15m@xmath165 star using ishizuka hyperonic eos as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "however , there are still possibilities to have the quark matter and the cp sweep in the late stage of core - collapse supernovae . in the thermal evolution of the proto - neutron star for @xmath13 20 sec after the birth in supernovae , the density and temperature increase further due to the contraction during the thermal evolution",
    "in fact , the condition may become closer to that of cp in the long term evolution after the bounce @xcite . in the massive proto - neutron star cases",
    "@xcite , hyperons and quarks appear in the late stage due to the extreme conditions , where they reach the phase boundaries .",
    "hence , the cp sweep may be realized in the evolution toward the black hole formation in the very massive proto - neutron stars , while the explosion goes on .",
    "it is also possible to have high density and temperature in the transition region to quark matter at the second bounce of the core collapse supernova when one adopts an eos having a low transition baryon chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "there are two comments in order .",
    "( a ) while we have compared the cp location and the bh formation profile in @xmath25 , the relation between the densities and chemical potentials is highly model dependent and the baryon densities in the quark and hadronic models considered here do not generally coincide ; for example , in njl and p - njl , the baryon densities on cp are found to be @xmath167 and @xmath168 at @xmath169 , respectively , while @xmath170 and @xmath171 in shen eos at the corresponding @xmath172 . in pqm with @xmath103 and 0.2 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 at @xmath175 , respectively , while @xmath176 and @xmath177 in shen eos on these points .",
    "thus the baryon densities in chiral effective and hadronic models have @xmath178 differences in density at cp , and the results shown in this article would be modified when we perform a consistent calculation using a hybrid supernova matter eos which smoothly connect quark and hadronic matter eoss .",
    "however , the trajectories span a wide region in @xmath179 which are in a range expected for the phase transition lines and cp , then we expect the cp sweep or at least the transition to quark matter even in a consistent calculation of the black hole formation .",
    "( b ) the symmetry energy in rmf models has a strong dependence in @xmath9 and may overestimate the effects at high densities . when one adopts a weak @xmath9 dependence of the symmetry energy at high densities , smaller isospin chemical potential results . in this case , the cross over transition during bh formation becomes less probable , since @xmath24 is kept to be high at small @xmath20 .",
    "in this letter , we have discussed the possibility of the qcd phase transition to quark matter and the critical point ( cp ) sweep during the dynamical black hole ( bh ) formation .",
    "we have compared the phase boundary and cp in chiral effective models with the bh formation profile , thermodynamical variables @xmath26 calculated in the neutrino - radiation hydrodynamics . for this comparison ,",
    "it is necessary to consider asymmetric matter at finite isospin chemical potential , @xmath180 .",
    "the isospin chemical potential is found to reduce the temperature of the critical point @xmath24 , then we have a larger possibility of the cp sweep or the cross over transition to quark matter .    in the chiral effective models considered here , with and without the vector interaction , the transition chemical potential at @xmath125",
    "is found to be in the range of @xmath181 in symmetric matter , and @xmath126 decreases at finite @xmath20 .",
    "we can compare these values with the highest baryon chemical potential realized during the bh formation , @xmath182 .",
    "then if the baryon chemical potential is larger than the qcd phase transition chemical potential , quark matter will be formed during the bh formation . in order to conclude , however , it is necessary to examine with the eos which includes both baryonic and quark degrees of freedom .",
    "the cp location is sensitive to the models and parameters .",
    "we have found that there are three types of possibilities of the transition to quark matter in the bh formation process .",
    "when the thermodynamical trajectory go below , above , or through cp in asymmetric matter , the qcd phase transition proceeds via the first order transition , the cross over transition , or the cp sweep .",
    "when cp is swept , the density fluctuation should grow , and we can expect various effects around cp such as the baryon density fluctuations , focusing of thermodynamical trajectories , disappearance of the sound mode , as discussed for the beam energy scan at rhic  @xcite .",
    "it is a big challenge to construct an eos which is applicable to the dynamical simulation of the core - collapse processes , contains both the hadronic and quark degrees freedom , and includes cp of qcd .",
    "there is an attempt to include both quark and baryon contributions based on the pqm  @xcite . in that work",
    ", the vacuum quark contribution is ignored and the qcd phase transition becomes the first order in the two - flavor chiral limit",
    ". it may be also necessary to consider the effects of inhomogeneous phases  @xcite , which may emerge around the first order phase boundary .",
