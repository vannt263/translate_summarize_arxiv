    "stellar evolution theory is crucial to yield a reliable clock for dating astrophysical objects .",
    "suitable color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and luminosity functions ( lfs ) are the most powerful tools to test theoretical models and , in turn , the _ running _ of the stellar clock . within this framework ,",
    "our group started a long  term project devoted to the quantitative analysis and testing of each individual evolutionary sequence in the cmds of galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) .",
    "in this paper we present the results of a detailed study of the red giant branch ( rgb ) , using cmds and lfs in the near  ir bands .",
    "since the contrast between the red giants and the unresolved background population in the ir bands is greater than in any optical region , they can be observed with the highest s / n ratio also in the innermost region of the cluster .",
    "moreover , when combined with optical observations , ir magnitudes provide useful observables such as for example the v ",
    "k color , which is an excellent indicator of the stellar effective temperature ( t@xmath3 ) .    the advantage of observing ggcs in the near ir is well known since many years .",
    "the first systematic ir survey of ggcs was carried out in their pioneering work by frogel , cohen & persson ( 1983 , hereafter fcp83 ) , which provided in particular the first quantitative description of the rgb location with varying the cluster metal abundance . however , due to intrinsic technical limits of the old single  channel detectors and aperture photometry , the fcp83 data  base includes only a few bright stars in the external regions of the clusters ( a total of @xmath4350 stars in 30 ggcs ) . a detailed comparison with the theoretical models based on suitable lfs was thus actually impossible because of the small number of observed stars .",
    "the advent of new ir arrays with pixel sizes and overall performances close to those of optical ccds has then opened new perspectives to the construction of large and complete samples of rgb stars with high photometric accuracy ( davidge & simons 1991 , 1994a , b ; minniti 1995 , minniti et al .",

    "in this section we discuss the basic assumptions and the corresponding uncertainties on the adopted metallicity scales , distance moduli and reddening for the clusters in our sample and their impact on the determination of the rgb parameters .",
    "the metallicity measurements most frequently used for ggcs refer to the classical scale proposed by zinn and collaborators in the 80 s ( zinn 1980 , zinn & west 1984 , zinn 1985 , hereafter z85 ) . even though new homogeneous observations of metallicity indicators have been obtained ( cf .",
    "e.g. carretta & gratton , 1997 ",
    "hereafter cg97  rutledge , hesser & stetson 1997 ) , the zinn s scale still represents the most complete data  set available in the literature .",
    "there are however reasons , discussed in the recent quoted papers , which suggest to slightly revise the zinn s scale according to the latest high  resolution spectral data .",
    "in particular , cg97 have recently presented high quality measurements of iron abundances using high dispersion spectra of @xmath28 and @xmath29 lines .",
    "they observed stars in a sample of 24 ggcs spanning the metallicity range @xmath30<-0.5 $ ] . by comparing their measurements with those published by z85",
    ", they noted that there are systematic differences ( up to @xmath31\\sim 0.2 $ ] ) with respect to the z85 scale , especially for intermediate metallicities ( [ fe / h]@xmath32 ) .",
    "cg97 derived a quadratic relation to transform the z85 data in their own scale ( cf .",
    "7 ) , which we will adopt in the following as reference . consequently ,",
    "since only 5 out of 10 ggcs considered in this paper have direct measurements in the gc97 list , for the other 5 the metallicity has been obtained by transforming the z85 estimate into the gc97 scale ( cf .",
    "a further consideration is important : in order to perform a correct parametrization of the rgb behavior as a function of metallicity , the simple knowledge of the quantity usually called _ iron abundance _ is not sufficient .",
    "in fact , it is known since many years ( renzini 1977 ) that the scaling of the rgb location in the cmd with metallicity is essentially due to the changing of the stellar opacity .",
    "the main source of the continuum opacity in the temperature range 30006000k , typical of the old rgb population of ggcs , are the @xmath33 ions .",
    "they form by capturing the electrons provided by metals with a low  ionization potential ( mainly mg , si , fe ) . for this reason , as noted among others by straniero & chieffi ( 1991 ) , and salaris & cassisi ( 1996 ) , the rgb location mainly depends on the [ mg+si+fe ] mixture abundance rather than on the [ fe ] abundance alone .",
    "therefore , a more reliable parameter to describe the actual metal content of the rgb stars is the so  called _ global _ metallicity , which takes into account not only the iron but also the the @xmath1element ( like mg and si ) abundance .",
    "there are many observational evidences ( cf . e.g. carney 1996 and references therein ) that @xmath1elements are enhanced with respect to iron in population ii stars .",
    "while there is a quite general consensus on the size of the mean overabundance ( [ @xmath1/fe]@xmath340.3 dex ) , the actual trend with metallicity is not firmly established ( cf .",
    "carney 1996 and origlia et al .",
    "1997 for references ) .    6.9truein    straniero & chieffi ( 1991 ) and salaris , chieffi & straniero ( 1993 ) demonstrated that , when computing the isochrones of population ii stars , the contribution of the @xmath1element enhancement can be taken into account by simply re  scaling standard models to the _ global _ metallicity [ m / h ] according to the following relation : @xmath35 = [ fe / h ] + log_{10 } ( 0.638 f_{\\alpha}+0.362)\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the enhanced factor of the @xmath1elements .",
    "following these prescriptions , in f99 we computed the _",
    "metallicity for a sample of 61 ggcs within the framework of a systematic study of the evolved sequences in the ( v , b ",
    "the values assumed here and listed in table 1 have been thus taken from table 2 in f99 .",
    "schematically , in f99 we assumed a constant @xmath37=0.28 $ ] for @xmath38<-1 $ ] and linearly decreasing to zero for @xmath39<0 $ ] .",
    "we also carefully discussed there the possible effect of different assumptions in the @xmath40enhancing relation .",
    "in particular , we showed that , adopting a constant enhancement over the entire range of metallicity ( @xmath41<0 $ ] ) ( carney 1996 ) rather than a linear decreasing trend for @xmath38>-1 $ ] , does not produce any significative difference in the description of the main rgb features in the ( v , b ",
    "v ) plane .      to convert the rgb fiducial lines into the absolute planes it is necessary to adopt a distance scale and to correct for reddening .    despite the huge observational efforts",
    ", the definition of the most suitable distance scale for ggcs is still very controversial and beyond the purposes of the present study ( see for discussion and references vandenberg et al . 1996 , chaboyer et al . 1996 , gratton et al .",
    "1997 , caloi et al .",
    "1997 , reid 1998 , pont et al .",
    "1998 , carretta et al .",
    "1999 ) .    in the following we",
    "adopt the distance scale discussed and eventually established in f99 . in that paper a new methodology to derive the actual level of the zahb and the distance moduli from the matching of v(zahb ) and the theoretical models computed by straniero , chieffi & limongi ( 1997 , hereafter scl97 ) has been presented .",
    "the theoretical relation adopted by f99 for the zahb is the following : @xmath42 ^ 2 + 0.3485 [ fe / h]+1.0005\\ ] ] which , in the range @xmath43<-0.4 $ ] , can also be described by the linear best  fit regression : @xmath44 + 1.5)+0.595\\ ] ]    among the many possible choices within the range of the so  called _ long _ and _ short _ distances scales ( see references above ) , this relation yields intermediate values for the ggc distance moduli .",
    "the reddening corrections have been computed using the latest compilation by harris ( 1996 ) . in table 1 ,",
    "the final metallicity ( cf .",
    "sect.4 ) , reddening ( harris 1996 ) and distance modulus ( from f99 , table 2 , column 7 ) adopted in this paper for the 10 ggcs in our sample are reported .",
    "the impact of different assumptions for the cluster distance scale and reddening will be discussed in sect .",
    "6.1.1 and 6.1.2 .",
    "though the uncertainty in the determination of the observable @xmath45 is @xmath46 mag ( see column 6 in table 1 ) for most of the clusters in our sample , according to f99 we conservatively estimate that the _ global _ uncertainty on the derived distance moduli listed in table 1 is of the order of @xmath47 mag .",
    "this estimate takes also into account the effect of the errors in the adopted metal abundances , reddening etc .. the distance modulus uncertainty turns to be the driving factor in the error budget of most of the rgb parameters derived in this paper , affecting both the determination of the absolute magnitude at which the rgb colors are measured and the absolute ( and then bolometric ) magnitude of the rgb bump and tip .",
    "thus our generous estimate of the distance modulus error yields also conservative estimates of rgb parameter uncertainties .",
    "it is more difficult to evaluate the reddening error for each individual cluster .",
    "however , by comparing the values quoted in different catalogs , we derive an average uncertainty of a few hundredths of magnitude , the largest values being those relative to the two most metal rich clusters in our sample ( namely ngc6553 and ngc6528 ) .",
    "since the main purpose of this paper is the detailed study of the rgb properties using suitable cmds , special care is devoted to properly define and measure : _",
    "i )  _ the parameters describing the rgb location in color and in magnitude and _ ii )  _ the parameters describing the rgb morphology , since they represent the most general and widely used descriptors of the rgb in any resolved stellar population .",
    "many different observables have been defined and used to locate the rgb in the classical v , b  v plane ( cf . f99 and reference therein ) , in the v , v ",
    "i plane ( da costa & armandroff 1990 ) and in the ir planes ( cf .",
    "e.g. fcp83 ) .",
    "fcp83 originally defined ( v  k)@xmath48 ( rgb ) and ( j  k)@xmath48 ( rgb ) as the colors of the mean rgb ridge line measured at m@xmath49=5.5 .",
    "afterwards , the rgb colors have been measured at different magnitude levels ( m@xmath50=5.0 and m@xmath50=4.0 , cf .",
    "cohen & sleeper 1995 , hereafter cs95 ) and the importance of such an approach is nicely illustrated by cs95 ( cf .",
    "e.g. their figure 3 ) . in the observational plane ,",
    "the color difference among mean ridge lines for clusters of different metallicity becomes progressively more and more pronounced ascending the rgb up to the tip , due to the the molecular blanketing effects .",
    "fcp83 also defined the m@xmath51 ( rgb ) as the rgb luminosity at constant color ( v  k)@xmath48=3.0 .",
    "this parameter samples different rgb regions depending from the cluster metallicity : while in metal  poor clusters m@xmath50 at ( v  k)@xmath48=3 marks the bright upper branch , in the metal  rich ones it intersects the intermediate rgb , slightly brighter than the hb level .    to properly map the overall behavior of the rgb as a function of the metallicity , in the following we measure the ( j  k)@xmath48 and ( v  k)@xmath48 colors at different magnitudes : m@xmath50=3 , 4 , 5 and 5.5 , and",

    "figure 13 by k95 ) .",
    "moreover , the sensitivity of the rgb slope to the metallicity is highly pronounced in the observational plane , since an enhancement of the molecular blanketing strongly affects the rgb colors , making extremely red the coolest and brightest stars .",
    "consequently , the rgb slope is a powerful metallicity indicator as shown for example by ortolani , barbuy & bica ( 1991 ) and k95 ( cf .",
    "their figure 15 ) .",
    "k95 presented jhk photometry of 4 high metallicity ggcs ( namely ngc5927 , ngc6712 , m71 and terzan 2 ) . using this sample and data previously published for other two clusters ( 47 tuc , frogel et al .",
    "1981 ; m69 , davidge & simons 1991 and fcp83 ) , they derived the rgb slopes in the k,(j  k ) plane by fitting the upper part of the rgb ( only the stars between 0.6 and 5.1 mag brighter than the zero age horizontal branch ( zahb ) level in k were considered ) .",
    "they proposed equations in the form j ",
    "k = b+a@xmath54k ( cf . their table 9 ) , and also correlated the rgb slope with the metallicity , finding the relation : @xmath38=-3.9 - 24.85 ~slope_{rgb}$ ] .",
    "this relation has been later refined by kf95 who found : @xmath38=-2.89 - 23.84 ~slope_{rgb}$ ] . in the present study",
    "we derive similar relations for the rgb slope in the k , j ",
    "k plane from our sample of ggcs .",
    "in order to perform a complete characterization of the rgb , in this section we calibrate the main rgb observables in the ir - cmds ( namely colors at fixed magnitudes , magnitudes at fixed colors , slope , bump and tip ) and discuss their dependence on metallicity . in doing this",
    "we use the distance moduli and reddening corrections listed in table 1 to locate the observed rgb fiducial ridge lines in the absolute m@xmath50,(j  k)@xmath48 and m@xmath50,(v  k)@xmath48 planes , as plotted in fig.3 .      the intrinsic ( j  k)@xmath48 and ( v  k)@xmath48 colors of the rgb measured at different absolute k magnitudes ( m@xmath50=3,4,5,5.5 , cf .",
    "sect.5.1 ) for the selected clusters are listed in table 2 and 3 , respectively . in fig.47 , we have plotted the rgb ( j  k)@xmath48 and ( v  k)@xmath48 colors as a function of the adopted cluster metallicity in the cg97 ( @xmath38_{cg97}$ ] ) and the _ global _ ( @xmath55 $ ] ) scales . the best fit relation to the data is also reported in each panel .",
    "as can be seen from figure 4 and 5 , the rgb ( j  k)@xmath48 color scales linearly with [ fe / h ] , independently of the selected rgb height - cut , and the slope increases progressively towards the rgb tip .    on the other hand , the rgb ( v  k)@xmath48 color significantly deviates from a linear dependence at high metallicity ( see the upper two panels in figs.6 and 7 ) .",
    "this behavior fully confirms the effect noted by cs95 , who found that the @xmath56[fe / h]/@xmath56(v  k)@xmath48 gradient decreases with increasing [ fe / h ] .    in order to estimate the possible impact on the inferred color  metallicity relations , by using different samples and different assumptions on the distance scale and reddening",

    "k color at a fixed k magnitude by @xmath340.010.02 mag to the red .",
    "thus , if we assume the same distance scale as cs95 , the discrepancy is reduced to @xmath1670.02 mag , that is well within the level of accuracy of both photometries .    in summary ,",
    "the observed discrepancy between our and cs95 ( j  k)@xmath48 colors can be mainly ascribed to differences in the assumed distance moduli , while the reddening and zero  point photometric calibrations are in reasonable agreement .",
    "moving to the ( m@xmath50,(v  k)@xmath48 ) plane , the discrepancy between our ( v  k)@xmath48 colors and those presented by cs95 ( cf .",
    "_ panels ( c ) and ( d ) _ in fig.8 ) are remarkably larger ( up to about 0.35 mag ) .",
    "two main factors can be invoked to explain such a discrepancy .",
    "different assumptions in the distance moduli produce a variation in the v ",
    "k color which is strongly dependent on the metallicity , due to the corresponding strong dependence of the rgb slope on the metallicity itself . since we assumed larger distance moduli than cs95",
    ", we expect to derive ( v  k)@xmath48 colors systematically bluer than cs95 , with progressively larger differences at larger metallicity , as indeed observed .",
    "different calibrations of the zero  point in the v magnitude also directly affect the ( v  k)@xmath48 color .",
    "cs95 used old v photometry for ngc6553 ( hartwick 1975 ) , ngc6528 ( van den berg & younger 1979 ) and ngc6171 ( sandage & katem 1964 ) .",
    "while the photometry of ngc6171 by sandage & katem ( 1964 ) is consistent with the one adopted here ( ferraro et al . 1991 ) , systematic differences are present in the case of ngc6553 and ngc6528 .",
    "fcp83 presented rgb parameters for 33 ggcs .",
    "7 out of 10 ggcs presented in this paper are in common with fcp83 ( 47tuc , m68 , m4 , m107 , m69 , m15 and ngc6553 ) .",
    "the residuals ( this paper ",
    "fcp83 ) for the ( j  k)@xmath168 and ( v  k)@xmath168 colors as a function of metallicity are plotted in fig.9 ( _ panel ( a ) _ and _ ( b ) _ , respectively ) . from inspecting this figure a possible trend of the ( j  k)@xmath48 and ( v  k)@xmath48 color residuals as a function of the metallicity",
    "is present ( cf .",
    "_ panels ( a ) _ and _ ( b ) _ ) , even though based on a poor statistics to draw any firm conclusions .",
    "our photometry tends to be bluer in the metal  poor domain and redder in the metal ",
    "rich one . while the adopted reddening corrections are almost identical , ( cf .",
    "_ panel ( c ) _ in fig.9 ) , it is interesting to note that , while the distance moduli adopted here are systematically ( 0.2 mag ) larger than those assumed by fcp83 , accounting for possible bluer colors at a fixed absolute magnitude , the two most metal rich clusters among those in common ( namely , ngc6553 and m69 ) seem to have distance moduli significantly smaller than those assumed by fcp83 ( cf . _ panel ( d ) _ in fig.9 ) .",
    "this fact naturally moves the colors at a fixed magnitude further to the red , and it is especially effective in the upper part of the rgb of metal ",
    "rich clusters , for which small variations in magnitude produce a large variation in color ( cf .",
    "fig.3 ) .    moreover ,",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the v photometry zero  point directly affects the ( v  k ) color and thus the different optical photometry adopted here with respect to fcp83 is expected to produce significant differences especially in the ( v  k ) color . in the case of m69 , for example ,",
    "ferraro et al . ( 1994a ) showed that the b , v photometry by hartwick & sandage ( 1968 ) and harris ( 1977 ) ( adopted by fcp83 ) has large ( up to @xmath169 mag ) systematic errors .",
    "following fcp83 , we measured , from fig .",
    "3 , the k magnitude m@xmath170 at a fixed ( v - k)@xmath171 color . in fig.10 we show the dependence of this parameter on metallicity ( @xmath38_{cg97}$ ] in _ panel ( a ) _ and @xmath55 $ ] in _ panel ( b ) _ , respectively ) .",
    "the best fit relation is also reported in each panel and plotted as a solid line .",
    "it is worth considering that our linear square fitting turns out to be significantly steeper ( 1.63 and 1.73 using @xmath38_{cg97}$ ] and @xmath55 $ ] , respectively ) than the fcp83 relation ( plotted as a _ dashed _ line in _ panel ( a ) _ of fig.10 ) .",
    "part of this discrepancy can be ascribed to the adopted metallicity scale . using the zinn scale as fcp83 did ,",
    "we would in fact obtain a shallower slope ( 1.43 ) than using cg97 metallicity scale , but still steeper than the fcp83 one ( @xmath172 ) .    in the same vein as for m@xmath170",
    ", we have defined a similar parameter in the m@xmath50,(j  k)@xmath48 plane , namely m@xmath173 , the absolute k magnitude at fixed ( j  k)@xmath174 color .",
    "this new parameter allows to characterize the rgb from a merely ir cmd and to constrain the photometric estimate of metallicity and reddening of obscured stellar clusters .",
    "the behavior of this new parameter as a function of metallicity ( @xmath38_{cg97}$ ] in _ panel ( a ) _ and @xmath55 $ ] in _ panel ( b ) _ , respectively ) is shown in fig.11 .",
    "the best fit solutions are also reported . as can be seen from the figures ,",
    "linear relations nicely match the data .",
    "the inferred absolute k magnitude m@xmath50 at fixed ( j  k)@xmath48=0.7 and ( v  k)@xmath48=3 rgb colors of the selected clusters are listed in columns 3 and 4 of table 4 , respectively .",
    "the uncertainties in the derived rgb k magnitude are essentially driven by the errors in the reddening .",
    "as expected , errors of a few hundredths of magnitude produce uncertainties of @xmath175 mag in the k magnitudes , depending on the rgb region intercepted ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "significative higher errors are only inferred for the two most metal - rich clusters ( ngc6553 and ngc6528 ) due to their very uncertain reddening estimates .",
    "6.9truein    6.9truein    6.9truein      to further describe the rgb properties in the ir cmd , we have also measured the so  called rgb slope ( @xmath176 ) , adopting the technique used by k95 and kf95 . even though linear fits are not the best tools to represent the upper rgb ( also in the ( k , j ",
    "k ) plane ) , they can be used as a first ",
    "order description of the overall rgb morphology .",
    "a basic step before measuring the slope is to isolate the rgb stars from field objects and members of different branches .",
    "this is not an easy task and we used the rgb samples here selected as described in sect.3 , where the agb and hb stars have been _ statistically _ removed from the cmd , before performing the linear fit to the data .",
    "the derived slopes for the 10 ggcs in our sample are listed in column 5 of table 4 .",
    "from the examination of these values it is evident how the rgb slope is a sensitive indicator of the cluster metal content : the average slope for the 5 most metal rich clusters in our sample ( with @xmath38_{cg97}>-1 $ ] ) turns out to be @xmath177 , while it is significantly flatter ( @xmath178 ) in the 4 most metal poor ones with @xmath38_{cg97}<-1.5 $ ] .",
    "this result fully confirms the kf95 suggestion that the rgb slope in the k , j ",
    "k plane is indeed one of the most robust ( reddening  independent ) indicator of the cluster metallicity .",
    "fig.12 shows a linear correlation of the rgb slope with the metallicity ( @xmath38_{cg97}$ ] in _ panel ( a ) _ and @xmath55 $ ] in _ panel ( b ) _ , respectively ) .",
    "the inferred relations ( also reported in fig.12 ) are fully compatible with those by k95 and kf95 .",
    "small differences can be ascribed both to the different metallicity scale adopted here ( cg97 rather than z85 used by k95 and kf95 ) , and to the fact that their relations have been derived only for metal rich clusters ( @xmath38>-1 $ ] ) , while those reported in fig.12 have been derived including also metal  poor ones .",
    "two ggcs are in common between our and the k95kf95 samples , namely 47tuc and m69 .",
    "these clusters allow us to perform a direct comparison .",
    "in the case of 47 tuc slightly different slopes have been measured : we get @xmath179 while k95 found 0.097 . in the case of m69",
    "the values are fully in agreement : we infer @xmath180 compared to 0.093 by k95 .",
    "however , we note that the quality ( both in terms of photometric accuracy and sample size ) of the ir cmds presented here for 47 tuc and for the other cluster is superior to the k95 data  base ( compare , for example , the diagrams in fig.1 with the last two panels of figure 11 in k95 ) .",
    "6.7truein      one of the most interesting features along the rgb is the so  called rgb bump ( iben 1968 ) .",
    "its name is due to the peaked distribution of the differential luminosity function along the rgb .",
    "the rgb evolution is characterized by a narrow burning hydrogen shell which is moving towards the outer region of the star .",
    "the shell is quite thin in mass and a temporary drop in luminosity is expected when it reaches the discontinuity in the hydrogen distribution profile generated by the inner penetration of the convective envelope .",
    "this interruption in the expansion of the stellar envelope has its signature in the differential lf star excess , the so  called bump .",
    "fusi pecci et al . ( 1990 ) and recently f99 showed how this feature can be safely identified in most of the current generation of optical cmds .",
    "as already noted by crocker & rood ( 1984 ) and fusi pecci et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , the main difficulty in detecting the rgb bump is having sufficiently large observational samples ( about 2000 rgb stars in the upper 3 mag ) .",
    "moreover , since in metal ",
    "poor clusters the rgb bump occurs at brighter luminosities , that is in a region which is intrinsically poorly populated ( towards the upper rgb ) , its identification is even more difficult .    following fusi pecci et al .",
    "( 1990 ) we used the integral and differential lfs to correctly locate the bump . in all but two clusters , namely m4 and m30 ,",
    "we succeeded in identifying the rgb bump with good accuracy .",
    "this is so far the largest near ir sample of population ii stars ever observed for which it is possible to measure the rgb bump .",
    "the observed k@xmath181 magnitude , the absolute magnitude m@xmath182 and the ( j  k)@xmath48 and ( v  k)@xmath48 colors of the rgb bump for the selected clusters are listed in table 5 . as can be seen , the size of the ir samples presented here allows a very accurate determination of this feature , similar to that one typically obtained from optical cmds ( cf .",
    "e.g. table 5 in f99 ) .",
    "in fig.13 the absolute k magnitude of the rgb bump as a function of the cluster metallicity in both scales ( @xmath38_{cg97 } $ ] and @xmath55 $ ] ) is plotted . the best fit relation to the data",
    "is also plotted as a solid line and the equation reported in each panel . as already noted in sect.4.3 ,",
    "the errors in the determinations of the absolute k magnitudes are mainly driven by the uncertainties in the distance moduli .    the dashed line in _ panel ( b ) _ of fig.13 represents the theoretical expectations based on the scl97 models , for an age of @xmath183 gyr ( straniero 1999 , private communication ) .",
    "as can be seen , the models show an excellent agreement with the observational data .",
    "this result fully confirms the finding of f99 ( from the location of the rgb bump in 47 ggcs in the visual band ) that the earlier discrepancy between theory and observations ( @xmath184mag ) ( cf .",
    "fusi pecci et al . 1990 ,",
    "ferraro 1992 ) has been completely removed using the latest theoretical models and the _ global _ metallicity ( @xmath55 $ ] ) .    6.4truein      a quite well defined relationship between the bolometric luminosity of the brightest rgb star in a ggc and its metallicity has been found by frogel , persson & cohen ( 1981 ) and fcp83 .",
    "this finding had a noteworthy impact both on testing the theoretical models and on the use of the brightest tgb stars as possible distance indicators .    in order to derive a similar relation using our sample of ggcs",
    ", we identified the _ candidate _ brightest giant in each cluster , paying particular care in the decontamination of possible field objects and ( especially in the case of metal ",
    "rich clusters ) of bright agb stars and the variables commonly associated to the agb , the so  called long period variables ( lpv ) .",
    "of course , the degree of reliability of the decontamination is hard to quantify due to the very small number of stars populating the brightest extreme of the giant branch , possibly affected by severe statistical fluctuations .",
    "table 6 reports the absolute k and bolometric magnitudes of the adopted brightest star ( the _ observed _ rgb tip ) for 9 of the 10 clusters considered in this paper ( m4 was excluded since the number of sampled giants is too low ) .",
    "fig.14 shows the absolute k magnitude of the tip as a function of the metallicity in the cg97 and _ global _ scales ( _ panel ( a ) and ( b ) _ ) , respectively .",
    "the following best fit relations have been derived : @xmath185_{cg97}-(6.97\\pm0.15)\\ ] ] @xmath186-(6.93\\pm0.14)\\ ] ] and they are plotted as solid lines in _ panel ( a ) _ and _ ( b ) _ of figure 14 , respectively .",
    "two points have been plotted for ngc6528 .",
    "this is a very metal  rich cluster and , like for instance 47 tuc , it is expected to have a number of bright variable agb stars , populating the upper part of the rgb .",
    "these stars have not been identified in this cluster yet , so a clear discrimination is not possible .",
    "for this reason we have plotted the brightest star in our sample as an empty circle , but since it could possibly be a lpv , we also consider as _ candidate _",
    "brightest rgb ( _ non variable _ ) star the reddest star among the brightest 5 stars in our photometry ( filled circle in fig.14 ) .",
    "the case of m69 is also worth of a brief discussion since the brightest not variable star in our photometry is star # 785 ( cf .",
    "figure 13 by ferraro et al .",
    "however , this star seems too blue in the ( k , v ",
    "k ) cmd to be a real rgb star ( cf . panel ( b ) of figure 13 in ferraro et al .",
    "for this reason in this cluster we also consider the second brightest star ( namely # 399 ) .",
    "both these stars have been reported in table 5 and in fig.14 .",
    "finally , the dashed line plotted in fig.14 represents the theoretical expectation based on scl97 models at @xmath183 gyr ( straniero 1999 , private communication ) .",
    "as can be seen the theoretical prediction nicely agrees with the observations and , though residual contamination and statistical fluctuations could still affect the sample , it seems quite rewarding the success of the theory in reproducing the data .",
    "it may also be interesting to note that such an agreement indirectly implies that the adopted distances and reddening should not be affected by large errors .",
