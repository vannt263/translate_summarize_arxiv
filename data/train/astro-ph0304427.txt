    "the measurement of distances to the `` nebulae '' early in the twentieth century revolutionized our understanding of the scale of the universe and provided the first evidence for universal expansion ( an overview of the history of cosmology can be found in longair ( this volume ) .",
    "distance measurements have played a profound role in unraveling the nature of the universe and the objects in it ever since . without knowing how far away objects are",
    ", we would not be able to learn very much about their sizes , energy sources , or masses . on a universal scale ,",
    "extragalactic distance measurements lie at the heart of our understanding of the size , age , composition , evolution , and future of the universe .",
    "the value of the hubble parameter today , , sets the scale of the universe in space and time , and measuring  depends heavily on accurate extragalactic distance measurements out to hundreds of mpc .",
    "accurate distance measurements are also needed to map the deviations from the smooth hubble expansion , or peculiar velocities , which presumably arise gravitationally due to the distribution of mass in the local universe .    during the last decade",
    "several important steps have been taken toward resolving the factor of @xmath0 uncertainty in the scale of the universe that overshadowed observational cosmology for 30 years .",
    "many of the improvements are the direct results of a better calibration and extension of the cepheid variable star distance scale .",
    "while significant systematic uncertainties remain , hubble constant measurements made using a wide variety of distance measurement techniques are now converging on values between 60 and 85 ; very few measurements lie outside this range , with the majority falling between 70 and 75 .",
    "several recent advances made the improved cepheid calibration possible .",
    "first , the _ hipparcos _ satellite made parallax distance measurements accurate to 10% to cepheid variable stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "_ hipparcos _ parallax measurements helped pin down the zeropoint brightness of the cepheid variable stars , but not enough cepheids could be observed to properly determine the slope of the period - luminosity ( pl ) relation .",
    "second , the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _  provided the spatial resolution and sensitivity to detect cepheids in galaxies as far away as 25 mpc , allowing for the first time a calibration of a number of secondary extragalactic distance indicators using cepheids .",
    "finally , the ogle microlensing experiment turned up thousands of cepheids in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) that were used to accurately determine the pl relation .",
    "the improved cepheid calibration of secondary distance indicators has largely yielded concordance on the scale of the universe , and the uncertainty in  is now arguably close to 10% .",
    "this summary is not intended to be an inclusive review of all the distance measurement techniques and their relative strengths and weaknesses .",
    "instead , we highlight some recent measurements and identify the most significant remaining systematic uncertainties .",
    "cepheids are emphasized , as they are currently used to calibrate most secondary distance indicators .",
    "we close by summarizing how planned future projects will improve our knowledge of the expansion rate and eventual fate of the universe .",
    "the hubble constant key project ( kp ) team set out to determine the hubble constant to 10% or better by reliably measuring cepheid distances to galaxies reaching distances of @xmath1  mpc ( mould et al .",

    "no adjustment to the pl relation was made to the baseline kp measurements for differences in metallicity between cepheids ( ferrarese et al .",

    "now that more accurate time delays have been measured for @xmath35 systems using radio , optical , and x - ray observations , the distribution of mass in the lensing galaxy is the largest remaining uncertainty in gravitational lens measurements of the hubble constant .",
    "the sz effect at submillimeter wavelengths , when combined with x - ray measurements of the hot gas in galaxy clusters , can be exploited to determine the angular diameter distance to the cluster ( carlstrom , holder , & reese 2002 ; reese et al .",
    "2002 ) . to date",
    ", there are 38 sz distance measurements extending to redshifts of @xmath52 .",
    "a fit to the 38 measurements yields @xmath53 , with an additional systematic uncertainty of order 30% ( carlstrom et al .",
    "the primary systematic uncertainties arise from cluster structure ( clumpiness and departures from isothermality ) or from point - source contamination .",
    "the sz hubble constant is also a function of the mass and dark energy density of the universe ; the value presented here assumes @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( reese et al .",
    "future sz surveys are expected to discover hundreds of new clusters , which should greatly improve our understanding of the density and expansion rate of the universe to @xmath56 ( carlstrom et al .",

    "is another way to sidestep the issues with empirical distance scale calibrations . both type ia and ii sne , along with sbfs ,",
    "can be primary distance indicators .",
    "we usually choose to calibrate sne and sbfs empirically using cepheids because of the acknowledged uncertainties in the many model parameters .",
    "the models are good enough , however , to provide some constraints on the distance scale and the quality of the cepheid calibration .",
    "recent models of type ia sne are now detailed enough to predict the absolute luminosity of the burst and therefore allow distances to be derived directly . the results reported by hflich & khokhlov ( 1996 ) , for example , show that ia sn models are consistent with a hubble constant of @xmath57 . while there are clearly many details in the explosion models that must be carefully checked against observations , it is reassuring that the predictions are in the right ball park .",
    "type ii sne have also been used as primary standard candles using a theoretically calibrated expanding - photosphere technique ( schmidt et al .",
    "1994 ; hamuy 2001 ) .",
    "schmidt et al . found @xmath40 , independent of the cepheid calibration .",
    "hamuy s ( 2001 ) updated measurement using the same technique yielded @xmath58 .",
    "sbfs are proportional to the second moment of the stellar luminosity function .",
    "standard stellar population models can be integrated to predict sbf magnitudes for populations with particular ages and metallicities , and then compared to observations ( blakeslee , vazdekis , & ajhar 2001 ; liu , charlot , & graham 2000 ; liu , graham , & charlot 2002 ) . in the @xmath3 band ,",
    "sbf comparisons with stellar population models would agree with observations better if the original kp cepheid zeropoint were fainter by @xmath59 mag ( blakeslee 2002 ) , which would make  10% larger .",
    "jensen et al . ( 2003 ) found that @xmath60-band sbfs were entirely self - consistent with both the vazdekis ( 1999 , 2001 ) and bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) models when the calibration of freedman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) was used without metallicity corrections .",
    "the hubble constant implied by the ir population models is 8% higher than that determined using the original kp cepheid calibration of ferrarese et al .",
    "( 2000a ) and 5% higher than that of freedman et al . ( 2001 ) with the metallicity correction .      as distance",
    "measurement techniques mature , two things generally happen : first , the number of measurements increases , reducing the statistical uncertainty , and second , the larger data sets make it possible to correct for secondary effects that modify the brightness of the standard candle .",
    "the result is a reduction in the statistical uncertainty to the point that systematic effects start to dominate .",
    "this is certainly true for cepheids and the secondary distance indicators calibrated using them . as shown in previous sections , systematic uncertainties in the cepheid distances dominate statistical uncertainties and the systematic differences between different secondary techniques .",
    "addressing systematic uncertainties is a difficult job that can not proceed until a sufficiently large number of measurements has been made to understand the intrinsic dispersion in the properties of a standard candle .",
    "some of the techniques discussed have not yet been applied to enough systems to conclusively say that small number statistics are not an issue , even though the formal statistical uncertainty of an individual measurement might be small .",
    "gravitational lens time delays have only been measured in five systems , for example .",
    "sz measurements are only now reaching large enough samples to start addressing the systematic uncertainties .",
    "fortunately , the sample sizes will increase significantly as surveys to find and measure more lensed quasars and sz clusters proceed .",
    "supernovae of all types are rare enough that finding enough nearby sne for calibration purposes has required using limited and often old , unreliable data .",
    "the probability distributions of systematic uncertainties is not always known , and is frequently not gaussian .",
    "for example , the range of  values permitted by the gravitational lens measurements is set by systematic uncertainties in the lens mass distribution .",
    "the extremes are rather rigidly limited by constraints on the possible fraction and distribution of dark matter in galaxies .",
    "the probability distribution is therefore rather close to a top hat , with `` sigma limits '' that are not at all gaussian ( e.g. , 2-@xmath61 ) .",
    "it is clearly not appropriate to add errors of this nature in quadrature .",
    "many researchers have maintained separate accounting of systematic and random uncertainties when possible ( cf .",
    ", ferrarese et al .",
    "even this approach requires the addition of different systematic uncertainties in quadrature , assuming that individual systematic uncertainties are independent and gaussian in nature . in many cases this",
    "is probably justified ; in others , simply reporting a range of possible values is more appropriate .",
    "the problem with reporting such ranges as a systematic uncertainty is that they are often viewed as being overly pessimistic by the casual reader who regards them as `` 1-@xmath43 '' uncertainties . given the difficulty in comparing very different systematic uncertainties , it is probably premature to judge the sz and gravitational lens results as being inconsistent with the cepheid - based distance indicators at the present time when the number of measurements is still rather few and the systematics have not been explored in great detail .",
    "the secondary distance indicators , mostly calibrated using cepheids , are all in good agreement when calibrated uniformly .",
    "these imply a hubble constant between 70 and 75 .",
    "many other techniques that do not rely on the calibration of the traditional distance ladder generally agree with this result at the 1-@xmath62 level ; further concordance between independent techniques will require a careful analysis of systematic uncertainties and new survey data that will become available in the next few years .",
    "improvements in the cepheid calibration will require a better zeropoint and larger samples covering a range of period and metallicity .",
    "near - ir photometry will help reduce uncertainties due to extinction .",
    "high - resolution imaging will help reduce blending and allow measurements of cepheids in more distant galaxies . improved photometry and excellent resolution",
    "will make the acs and wfpc3 on _ hst _  powerful cepheid - measuring instruments .",
    "_ sim _  and _ gaia _  are two astrometry satellite missions planned by nasa and esa that will help reduce systematic uncertainties in the extragalactic distance scale by providing accurate ( 1% ) parallax distances for a significant number of galactic cepheids .",
    "_ sim _  and _ gaia _  will allow us to calibrate the cepheid zeropoint , pl relation , and metallicity corrections without having to rely on the lmc sample or the distance to the lmc .",
    "we are optimistic that the debate over the `` long '' and `` short '' distance scales for the lmc will soon be behind us .",
    "while this will be a significant milestone , it will not help much to reduce the statistical uncertainty in the measured value of the hubble constant .",
    "it will , however , remove one persistent source of systematic error . to achieve a hubble constant good to 5%",
    "using a distance estimator tied to the lmc will require much more accurate geometrical measurements , and a reduction of the other systematic uncertainties as well .    with _ sim _  and _ gaia _ , the calibration of several variable star distance scales in addition to the cepheids will be solidified .",
    "these include rr lyrae variables , delta scuti stars , and shorter - period overtone pulsators .",
    "the increased sensitivity and spatial resolution of the next generation of large ground and space telescopes will allow us to detect these fainter variables in the distant galaxies in which only cepheids are currently detectable .",
    "other variable stars will allow us to resolve questions about bias that arise when only the very brightest members of the cepheid population are detected and used to determine the distance .",
    "the number of ways to bypass the cepheid rung of the distance ladder will increase dramatically when _ sim _  and _ gaia _  allow us to calibrate a number of secondary distance indicators directly from statistical parallax distance measurements to m31 , m32 , and m33 .",
    "techniques like sbf , tully - fisher , fp , gclf , pnlf , and so forth , have already been used to determine accurate relative distances between the local group members m31 , m32 , and m33 and more distant galaxies . by determining their distances directly from statistical parallax measurements ,",
    "the systematic uncertainties in the cepheid calibration and lmc distance will be avoided altogether .",
    "improvements in techniques that bypass the local distance ladder and secondary distance indicators are imminent .",
    "larger samples of well - measured gravitational lens time delays and sz clusters will help reduce statistical uncertainties and provide insight into the systematics .",
    "better mass models for gravitational lenses will not only lead to better determinations of , but also be valuable in constraining the quantity and distribution of dark matter in galaxies .",
    "the increasing number of sz measurements will lead to a better understanding of galaxy cluster structure and evolution .    the number of direct geometrical distance measurements to nearby galaxies will also increase .",
    "the masers detected in ngc  4258 must also exist in other galaxies . a larger sample of detached eclipsing binaries , both in the lmc and in other galaxies , will help overcome the systematic uncertainties and provide more consistent distances .",
    "these techniques , like sne in nearby galaxies , are limited by small - number statistics .",
    "an individual measurement may seem reliable , but until more are found , our confidence in them will be limited .    several new synoptic and survey facilities are currently being planned that will discover many thousands of sne .",
    "the _ snap _",
    "satellite will discover thousands of sne over its lifetime",
    ". it will be able to measure optical and near - ir brightnesses and collect spectra for sn classification .",
    "the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) and panstarrs survey telescopes , currently in the planning stages , will discover hundreds of thousands of ia sne every year .",
    "the synoptic telescopes will also reveal a multitude of faint variable stars in the galaxy . with this wealth of data ,",
    "systematic uncertainties can be addressed and the expansion rate of the universe determined as a function of redshift to @xmath63 .",
    "we will only be limited by our ability to follow up the sn discoveries to determine reliable distances .",
    "perhaps the best determination of  in the future will come from the combination of multiple joint constraints , just as the conclusions regarding the @xmath64 universe came from merging the type ia sn results with the measurements of @xmath65 from the cosmic microwave background experiments .",
