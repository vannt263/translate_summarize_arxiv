    "it has been hypothesized that , in many areas of the brain , having different brain functionality , repeatable precise spatiotemporal patterns of spikes play a crucial role in coding and storage of information .",
    "temporally structured replay of spatiotemporal patterns have been observed to occur during sleep , both in the cortex and hippocampus @xcite , and it has been hypothesized that this replay may subserve memory consolidation . the sequential reactivation of hippocampal place cells , corresponding to previously experienced behavioral trajectories , has been observed also in the awake state ( awake replay ) @xcite , namely during periods of relative immobility .",
    "awake replay may reflect trajectories through either the current environment or previously , spatially remote , visited environments .",
    "a possible interpretation is that spatiotemporal patterns , stored in the plastic synaptic connections of hippocampus , are retrieved when a cue activates the emergence of a stored pattern , allowing these patterns to be replayed and then consolidated in distributed circuits beyond the hippocampus @xcite .",
    "cross - correlogram analysis revealed that in prefrontal cortex the time scale of reactivation of firing patterns during post - behavioral sleep was compressed five- to eightfold relative to waking state @xcite , a similar compression effect may also be seen in primary visual cortex@xcite .",
    "internally generated spatiotemporal patterns have also been observed in the rat hippocampus during the delay period of a memory task , showing that the emergence of consistent pattern of activity may be a way to maintain important information during a delay in a task @xcite .    among repeating patterns of spikes a central role",
    "is played by phase - coded patterns @xcite , i.e. patterns with precise relative phases of the spikes of neurons participating to a collective oscillation , or precise phases of spikes relatively to the ongoing oscillation .",
    "first experimental evidence of the importance of spike phases in neural coding was observed in experiments on theta phase precession in rat s place cells @xcite , showing that spike phase is correlated with rat s position .",
    "recently , the functional role of oscillations in the hippocampal - entorinal cortex circuit for path - integration has been deeply investigated @xcite , showing that place cells and grid cells form a map in which precise phase relationship among units plays a central role .",
    "in particular it has been shown@xcite that both spatial tuning and phase - precession properties of place cells can arise when one has interference among oscillatory cells with precise phase relationship and velocity - modulated frequency .",
    "further evidence of phase coding comes from the experiments on spike - phase coding of natural stimuli in auditory and visual primary cortex @xcite , and from experiments on short - term memory of multiple objects in prefrontal cortices of monkeys @xcite .",
    "these experimental works support the hypothesis that collective oscillations may underlie a phase dependent neural coding and an associative memory behavior which is able to recognize the phase coded patterns .",
    "the importance of precise timing relationships among neurons , which may carry information to be stored , is supported also by the evidence that precise timing of few milliseconds is able to change the sign of synaptic plasticity .",
    "the dependence of synaptic modification on the precise timing and order of pre- and post - synaptic spiking has been demonstrated in a variety of neural circuits of different species .",
    "many experiments show that a synapse can be potentiated or depressed depending on the precise relative timing of the pre- and post - synaptic spikes .",
    "this timing dependence of magnitude and sign of plasticity , observed in several types of cortical @xcite and hippocampal @xcite neurons , is usually termed spike timing dependent plasticity ( stdp ) .",
    "the role of stdp has been investigated both in supervised learning framework @xcite , in unsupervised framework in which repeating patterns are detected by downstream neurons @xcite , cortical development @xcite , generation of sequences @xcite and polychronous activity @xcite , and in an associative memory framework with binary units @xcite . however",
    ", this is the first time that this learning rule has been used to make a if network to work as associative memory for phase - coded patterns of spike , each of which becomes a dynamic attractor of the network .",
    "notably , in a phase coded pattern not only the order of activation matters , but the precise spike timing intervals between units .",
    "we therefore present a possibility to build a circuit with stable phase relationships between the spikes of a population of if neurons , in a robust way with respect to noise and changes of frequency .",
    "the first important result of the paper is the measurement of the storage capacity of the model , i.e. the maximum number of distinct spatiotemporal patterns that can be stored and selectively retrieved , since it has never been computed in a spiking model for spatiotemporal patterns .",
    "several classic papers ( see @xcite and references therein ) have focused on storage capacity of binary model with static binary patterns @xcite , and much efforts have been done to use more biophysical models and patterns @xcite , but , up to our knowledge , without any calculation of the storage capacity of spatiotemporal patterns in if spiking models .",
    "notably , by introducing an order - parameter which measures the overlap between phase coded spike trains , we are able quantitatively measure of the overlap between the stored pattern and the replay activity , and to compute the storage capacity as a function of the model parameters . + another important result is the study of the different regimes observed by changing the excitability parameters of the network . in particular , we find that near the region of the parameter space where the network tends to become unresponsive and silent there is a regime in which the network responds selectively to cue presentation with a short transient replay of the phase - coded pattern . differently , in the region of higher excitability , the patterns are replayed persistently and selectively , and eventually with more then one spike per cycle .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec - model ] introduces the leaky - integrate - and - fire ( if ) neuronal model ; section [ sec - connections ] describes the stdp learning rule used to design the connections ; in section [ sec - dyn ] we study the emergence of collective dynamics and introduce an order parameter to measure the overlap between the collective dynamics and the stored phase coded patterns ; section [ sec - capacity ] reports on the storage capacity of the network , i.e. the maximum number of patterns that can be stored and selectively retrieved in the network ; the parameter space and the different working regions are also investigated in section [ sec - capacity ] ; in section [ sec - noise ] we study the robustness of the retrieval dynamics wrt noise and heterogeneity ; section [ sec - oscillators ] reports on the implication of this model in the framework of oscillatory interference model of path - integration ; summary and discussion are outlined in section [ sec - summary ] .",
    "we consider a recurrent neural network with @xmath0 possible connections @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of neural units .",
    "the connections @xmath1 are designed during the learning mode , when the connections change their efficacy according to a learning rule inspired to the stdp .",
    "after the learning stage , the connections values are frozen , and the collective dynamics is studied .",
    "this distinction in two stages , plastic connection in the learning mode and frozen connections in the dynamics mode , is a useful framework to simplify the analysis .",
    "it also finds some neurophysiological motivations in the effects of neuromodulators , such as dopamine and acetylcholine @xcite , which regulate excitability and plasticity .",
    "the single neuron model is a leaky integrate - and - fire ( if ) @xcite .",
    "this simple choice , with few parameters for each neuron , is suitable to study the emergence of collective dynamics and the diverse regimes of the dynamics , instead of focusing on the complexity of the neuronal internal structure .",
    "we use the spike response model ( srm ) formulation @xcite of the if model , which allows us to use an event - driven programming and makes the numerical simulations faster with respect to a differential equation formulation .    in this picture , the postsynaptic membrane potential is given by : @xmath3 where @xmath1 are the synaptic connections , @xmath4 describes the response kernel to incoming spikes on neuron @xmath5 , and the sum over @xmath6 runs over all presynaptic firing times following the last spike of neuron @xmath5 .",
    "namely , each presynaptic spike @xmath7 , with arrival time @xmath8 , is supposed to add to the membrane potential a postsynaptic potential of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10   \\theta(t-{\\hat t}_j ) \\label{tre}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the membrane time constant ( here 10 ms ) , @xmath12 is the synapse time constant ( here 5 ms ) , @xmath13 is the heaviside step function , and k is a multiplicative constant chosen so that the maximum value of the kernel is 1 .",
    "the sign of the synaptic connection @xmath1 sets the sign of the postsynaptic potential s change , so there s inhibition for negative @xmath1 and excitation for positive @xmath1 .",
    "when the membrane potential @xmath14 exceeds the spiking threshold @xmath15 , a spike is scheduled , and the membrane potential is reset to the resting value zero .",
    "we use the same threshold @xmath16 for all the units , except in sec [ sec - noise ] where different values @xmath15 are used and the robustness w.r.t .",
    "the heterogeneity is studied .",
    "clearly the spiking threshold @xmath16 of the neurons is related to the excitability of the network , an increase of the value of @xmath17 is also equivalent to a decrease of k , the size of the unitary postsynaptic potential , or , equivalently to a global decrease in the scaling factor of synaptic connections @xmath1 .",
    "+ numerical simulations of this dynamics are performed for a network with @xmath18 stored patterns , where connections @xmath1 are determined via a learning rule described in the next paragraph .",
    "we found that a few number of spikes , given a in proper time order , are able to selectively induce the emergence of a persistent collective spatiotemporal pattern , which replays one of the stored pattern ( see sec [ sec - dyn ] ) .",
    "in a learning model previously introduced in @xcite , the average change in the connection @xmath1 , occurring in the time interval @xmath19 $ ] due to periodic spike trains of period t , with @xmath20 , was formulated as follows : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a normalization factor , @xmath23 is the activity of the pre - synaptic neuron at time t , and @xmath24 the activity of the post - synaptic one .",
    "it means that the probability for unit @xmath5 to have a spike in the interval @xmath25 is proportional to @xmath26 in the limit @xmath27 .",
    "the learning window a(@xmath28 ) is the measure of the strength of synaptic change when a time delay @xmath29 occurs between pre and post - synaptic activity .",
    "to model the experimental results of stdp in hippocampal neurons , the learning window @xmath30 should be an asymmetric function of @xmath29 , mainly positive ( ltp ) for @xmath31 and mainly negative ( ltd ) for @xmath32 .",
    "+ equation ( [ lr ] ) holds for activity pattern @xmath33 which represents instantaneous firing rate , and is suitable to use in analog rate models @xcite and spin network models @xcite .",
    "differently , here , being interested in spiking neurons , the patterns to be stored are defined as precise periodic sequence of spikes , i.e. spike - phase coded patterns .",
    "namely , activity of the neuron @xmath7 is a spike train at times @xmath34 , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the set of spikes times of unit j in the pattern @xmath37 with period @xmath38 , and frequency @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , following eq.([lr ] ) , the change in the connections @xmath1 due to the learning of the pattern @xmath37 when the time duration of the learning process @xmath40 is longer then a single period @xmath38 , is simply given by @xmath41 the window @xmath30 , shown in fig .  1 ,",

    "this function satisfies the balance condition @xmath49 .",
    "notably , when @xmath30 is used in eq .",
    "[ lr2 ] to learn phase - coded patterns with uniformly distributed phases , then the property @xmath50 assures that in the connection matrix the summed excitation @xmath51 and the summed inhibition @xmath52 are equal in the thermodynamic limit , and therefore it assures a balance between excitation and inhibition .    writing eq .",
    "( [ lr]-[lr2 ] ) , implicitly we have assumed that , with periodic phase - coded spike trains used to induce plasticity , the effects of all separate spike pairs sum linearly , each weighted by the same stdp window reported in fig .",
    "timing - dependent learning curves as the one reported in fig .",
    "1 are indeed typically measured by giving an order of 100 pairs of spikes repeatly , with fixed phase relationship , and fixed frequency in a proper range .",
    "however , in different situations , for instance if the frequency is too low or to high @xcite , or in case of few spike pairs @xcite , the timing dependence of plasticity is not well described by the bidirectional window used here , and a more detailed model is needed to account for integration of spike pairs when arbitrary trains are used ( see @xcite and references therein ) .     used in the learning rule ( see eqs .",

( 6 ) ) are determined by fitting the experimental data reported in @xcite.,width=188 ]    the spikes patterns used in this work are periodic spatiotemporal sequences , made up of one spike per cycle and each of which has a phase @xmath53 randomly chosen from a uniform distribution in @xmath54 . in each pattern , information is coded in the precise time delay between spikes of unit @xmath5 and unit @xmath7 , which corresponds to a precise phase relationship among units @xmath5 and @xmath7 . a spatiotemporal pattern represented in this way is often called phase coded pattern .",
    "pattern s information is coded in the spiking phases which , in turn , shape the synaptic connectivity responsible of the emerging dynamics and the memory formation .",

    "when multiple patterns are stored in the same connectivity , with phases of one pattern uncorrelated with the others , bidirectional connections are possible , and the more the stored patterns , the less the ring - like is the connectivity . even in the cases",
    "when the connectivity is not ring - like the network is still able to retrieve each of the p stored patterns in a proper range of threshold values ( see storage capacity in sec [ sec - capacity ] ) .",

    "the results show that , within a well specified range of parameters , our if network is able to work as an associative memory for spike - phase patterns .    in order to check if the network is able to retrieve selectively each of the stored patterns , we give an initial signal , made up of @xmath60 spikes , taken from the stored pattern @xmath37 , and we check if this initial short cue is able to selectively trigger a collective sustained activity that is the replay of the same stored pattern @xmath37 , i.e. checking if the sustained activity has spikes aligned to the phases @xmath61 of pattern @xmath37 .",

    "importantly , the sensitivity of collective oscillation frequency on spiking threshold is not a sensitivity of the single unit but of the collective behavior , since , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec - noise ] , if we change the spiking threshold of few units the collective rhythm is still unique for the whole population .",

    "one of the more interesting discovery of place cells behavior is indeed the ` remapping ' of the place cell representation of space in response to a changes in sensory or cognitive inputs , i.e. place cells change their firing properties ( place cells can appear disappear or move to other unpredictable locations )",

    "if the place cell will fire at a specific ` place ' where its inputs become synchronized@xcite , by recalling a different phase - coded pattern among the ones stored in our circuit , it will change the phases of theta cells that are the inputs of the place cell , and it will change the specific place where the inputs become    finally we note that even thou our model is not a continuous attractor , it shares many similarity with such a class of models .",
    "our model is a circuit with many distinct attractors , one for each phase - relationship stored in the network , and the number of different attractor states is set by the maximal storage capacity studied here .",
    "furthermore each attractor is a phase - coded pattern , replayed with a collective resonant frequency that can be modulated by changing for example the spiking threshold of the units .    even thou during exploration the activity of place cells",
    "may be explained by the superposition of velocity - controlled oscillators inputs , the recurrent connections inside the place cells network may have anyway a relevant role .    during sleep , in absence of external input , the role of recurrent connections increases , probably due to an increase of excitability via neuromodulators or other mechanisms , and the spontaneous activity of the network show temporarily short replay of stored patterns , probably initiated simply by noise .",
    "so the pattern activated repeatly during experience , is stored in the connectivity , and then activated during sleep when the network is near a critic point and noise is able to initiate short replay sequences .",
    "replay of phase - coded patterns of neural activity during sleep has been observed in hippocampus and neocortex@xcite    notably in our model the time scale of reactivation is different from the time scale of storing , depends on the collective frequency which emerges from the connectivity , and may be accelerated or slowed down changing parameters such as spiking thresholds .",
    "therefore , our model might be also relevant for replay in prefrontal cortex ( pfc ) or other cortical areas in which replay is accelerated with respect to awake activity .    in the hippocampus , spikes representing adjacent place fields occur in rapid succession within a single theta cycle during behavior .",

    "however , reactivation in rat pfc is clearly compressed five to eight times relative to the waking state@xcite . indeed , while in hippocampus one may think that the coding sequence is the within - theta cycle , in prefrontal cortex it is clearly seen that the cross - correlation among cells during sleep replay is time compressed compared with the cross - correlation during waking state .",

    "this opens a possible way to govern the frequency of collective oscillation via neuromodulators , and to encode information ( such as velocity of the animal ) in the frequency of the oscillations , in addition to the information encoded in the phase relationships .",
    "notably , in a particular range of frequencies , the spiking threshold does not affect the frequency of oscillation but changes the number of spike per cycle during the retrieval dynamics .",
    "this means that information can be encoded via the number of spikes per cycle , independently from the information coded in the phase relationship among units , in agreement with the observations of independent rate and phase coding in hippocampus @xcite .",
    "important to note , the phase relationships and the frequency of the collective oscillation are both robust with respect to noise and to heterogeneity of the spiking threshold of the units . + a systematic study of the retrieval capacity of the network is proposed as a function of two parameters of the model : the frequency of the input pattern and the spiking threshold .",
    "the storage capacity , evaluated as @xmath178 , is always lower than the storage capacity of the hopfield model .",
    "however , the information content of a single pattern in our dynamical model with n units is higher than the information content of a pattern in the hopfield model with n - units .",
    "indeed , an hopfield pattern is a set of n binary values while our phase - coded pattern is a set of n real number @xmath179 $ ] .",
    "+ the role of stdp in the formation of sequences has been recently investigated in @xcite .",
    "these studies have shown how it s possible to form long and complex sequences , but they did not concern themselves on how it s possible to learn and store not only the order of activation in a sequence , but the precise relative times between spikes in a closed sequence , i.e. a phase - coded pattern . in our model not only the order of activation is preserved , but also the precise phase relationship among units . the tendency to synchronization of units is avoided in our model , without need to introduce delays or adaptation , due to the balance between excitation and inhibition that is in the connectivity of large networks when the phase coded pattern with random phases is learned using the rule in eqs .",
    "( 5 - 8 ) . in our rule",
    "all the connections , both positive and negative , scale with the time of presentation of patterns , keeping always a balance . indeed , since ( 1 ) the stored phase are uniformly distributed in @xmath54 and ( 2 ) the learning window has the property @xmath50 , then the connectivity matrix in eq .",
    "( 7 ) has the property that the summed excitation @xmath51 and the summed inhibition @xmath52 are equal in the thermodynamic limit ( indeed they are of order unity , while their difference is of order @xmath180 ) .",
    "the task of storing and recalling phase - coded memories has been also investigated in @xcite in the framework of probabilistic inference . while we study the effects of couplings given by eqn.(5 ) in a network of if neurons , the paper @xcite studies this problem from a normative theory of autoassociative memory , in which real variable @xmath181 of neuron @xmath5 represents the neuron @xmath5 spike timing with respect to a reference point of an ongoing field potential , and the interaction @xmath182 among units is mediated by the derivative of the synaptic plasticity rule used to store memories .",
    "the model proposed here is a mechanism which combines oscillatory and attractor dynamics , which may be useful in many models of path - integration , as pointed out in sec .",
    "( [ sec - oscillators ] ) .",
    "our learning model offers a if circuit able to keep robust phase - relationship among cells participating to a collective oscillation , with a modulated collective frequency , robust with respect to noise and heterogeneities .",
    "notably the frequency of the collective oscillation in our circuit is not sensible to the single value of the threshold of each unit , but to the average value of the threshold of all units , since all units participate to a single collective oscillating pattern which is an attractor of the dynamics .",
    "recently there is renewed interest in reverberatory activity@xcite and in cortical spontaneous activity@xcite whose spatiotemporal structure seems to reflect the underlying connectivity , which in turn may be the result of the past experience stored in the connectivity .",
    "+ similarity between spontaneous and evoked cortical activities has been shown to increase with age @xcite , and with repetitive presentation of the stimulus @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in our if model , in order to induce spontaneous patterns of activity reminiscent of those stored during learning stage , few spikes with the right phase relationship are sufficient .",
    "it means that , even in absence of sensory stimulus , a noise with the right phase relationships may induce a pattern of activity reminiscent of a stored pattern .",
    "therefore , by adapting the network connectivity to the phase - coded patterns observed during the learning mode , the network dynamics builds a representation of the environment and is able to replay the patterns of activity when stimulated by sense or by chance .",
    "this mechanism of learning phase - coded patterns of activity is then a way to adapt the internal connectivity such that the network dynamics have attractors which represent the patterns of activity seen during experience of environment .",
