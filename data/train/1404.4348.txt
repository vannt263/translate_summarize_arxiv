    "studying extrasolar planets is one of the major frontiers of astronomy today .",
    "the field has transformed from simple identification to comprehensive categorization and characterization of exoplanets and exoplanetary systems .",
    "analyses of data provided by nasa s _ _ kepler _ _ mission has revolutionized this field by compiling a statistically significant number of transiting planets and planetary candidates ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for example , _ kepler _ data allowed researchers to discover kepler 9b ( @xcite ) , the first multi - planetary system outside our solar system ; kepler 10b ( @xcite ) , one of the first confirmed rocky planets outside the solar system ; and kepler 16b ( @xcite ) , the first circumbinary planet .",
    "more recently the _ kepler _ team announced the discovery of potentially habitable worlds in the kepler 62 ( @xcite ) and kepler 69 ( @xcite ) systems , and the near - earth - sized planets kepler-186f",
    "( @xcite ) and kepler-452b ( @xcite ) in the habitable zones of their parent stars .",
    "deeper analyses are possible using the exquisite _ kepler _ data beyond merely detecting exoplanetary systems : researchers are now able to analyze large samples of planetary candidates to pin down occurrence rates such as @xmath5 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , find non - transiting planets via transit timing variations ( @xcite ) , perform phase - curve analyses ( @xcite ) , and may eventually even be able to detect exomoons ( @xcite ) and exotrojans ( @xcite ) .    for the close - in , and therefore hot , planets around bright , high - signal host stars in the _ kepler _ data set , we are able to analyze secondary eclipses ,",
    "i.e. , the modulated flux from the star - planet system when the light ( reflection and thermal emission ) of the planet disappears during its passage behind the parent star .",
    "differential measurements then help us to characterize physical parameters of the planet such as albedo and temperature .",

    "_ primary transit _",
    "the planet crosses the star . from a broadband transit - lightcurve , in this case , one can measure the planetary radius @xmath6 in units of the stellar radius @xmath7 .",
    "the depth of the transit is @xmath8 , which for a jupiter radius planet transiting a sun - like star , is of the order of @xmath9 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    if the geometry ( inclination , eccentricity ) is right the planet also disappears behind its host star in a so - called _",
    "secondary eclipse_. for a 2000 k hot jupiter - size planet , the typical flux deficit during secondary eclipse is @xmath10 ppm at @xmath11 in the near - infrared and even larger at longer wavelengths , but considerably smaller at optical wavelengths ( 400 - 900 nm ) at which _ kepler _ observes .",
    "however , for host stars that are bright enough ,",
    "outstanding sensitivity provides a direct measure of the planet s disk - averaged day side flux for some of its targets , particularly close - in gas giants  so called hot jupiters and hot neptunes.    observing secondary eclipses combined with planetary phase curves can help us to characterize the planet and its atmosphere .",
    "for example , the depth of the secondary eclipse can constrain the albedo of the planet , while the timing and width of the secondary eclipse can help determine its orbital parameters . comparing the amplitude of the reflected light in the phase curve with the depth of the secondary eclipse",
    "can constrain the day and night side temperatures , and therefore confirm the planetary nature of a candidate that is not self - luminous , and help to understand day to night side heat exchange . measuring exoplanet",
    "eclipses , phase curves and albedo values yield information about the composition of their atmosphere , and day to night side temperature ratios yield the efficiency of energy transport and presence of possible temperature inversions ( for details see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "several previous studies have focused on eclipses and phase curves in the _ kepler _ database , either on select samples of objects ( e.g. , @xcite 5 objects ; @xcite 76 objects ; @xcite 8 objects ) or for individual planets or candidates ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in the largest sample so far , @xcite modeled secondary eclipses and phase curves ( only via a simple sinusoidal flux term applied to the lightcurves ) of a uniform set of hot jupiter candidates from _ kepler _ to derive albedos and thermal emission properties , and compared the results with stellar and planetary parameters . while our study is similar in scope to this study , we worked with much more data ( 15 quarters  as available in august 2013  of data instead of 1 ) , a slightly bigger radius range ( 4 earth radii = 0.4 jupiter radii , instead of 0.5 jupiter radii as a lower limit ) , and a longer period range ( 10 days instead of 5 days ) .",
    "furthermore we applied a fully physical model with all different phase curve components .",
    "of the @xcite sample of 76 kois only 55 were successfully modeled with their methods .",
    "of these 55 systems many still remain unconfirmed planetary candidates or turned out to be false postives ( e.g. , kois 102 , 1419 , 1459 , 1541 , 1543 ; http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/ , august 2015 ) . for the confirmed planets there is significant overlap in our samples ( kois 1 , 2 , 10 , 13 , 17 , 18 , 20 , 97 , 127 , 128 , 196 , 202 , 203 , 204 ) , but several planets in our study ( kois 3 , 7 , 98 , 135 , 428 and 1658 ) were not covered by their analysis .    here we present initial results of a comprehensive and consistent study of secondary eclipses and phase curves using data from quarters 0 through 15 of _ kepler _ lightcurves ( see table [ tbl : used_quarters ] ) , that were available at the time of our analysis . in this paper",
    "we focus on the 20 confirmed ( august 2013 ) planets in the sample of 489 kepler objects of interest ( koi ) with @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "consistent measurements of exoplanet phase curves not only allows us to break many current degeneracies in modeling the thermal and chemical structure of separate exoplanet atmospheres , but also enables us to compare results across the whole set of analyzed systems in a comprehensive way .",
    "analyses like this will also help us prepare for future ground- and space - based facilities that increase the number of exoplanetary systems and the wavelength range of precision observations .",
    "for each of our targets , we used up to 16 quarters of the pre - search data conditioning simple aperture photometry ( pdcsap ) lightcurves from the _ kepler _ database available in the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) at the time of our analysis ( see table [ tbl : used_quarters ] ; prior to the release of q16 in aug 2013 ) ) .",
    "the pdcsap lightcurves are simple aperture photometry timeseries that have been cotrended in the _ kepler _ pipeline to remove systematics common to multiple targets , using a best - fit of so - called ` cotrending basis vectors ' ( cbvs ) .",
    "the cbvs are essentially the principal components of systematic artifacts for each science target and each operational quarter characterized by quantifying the features most common to hundreds of strategically - selected quiet targets sampled across the detector array ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "short - cadence data were used in place of long - cadence data when available and both data sets were combined weighted by their errors .",
    "we used pyke ( @xcite ) , a series of python - based pyraf recipes , for the individual and target - specific analysis and reduction of _ kepler _ timeseries data .",
    "our first step was to remove long - term variability using the ` kepflatten ` task to fit a quadratic polynomial to the baseline parts of the lightcurve for each quarter over time intervals of seven times the length of the published orbital period of each planet ( see table [ tbl : used_params ] ) using a sigma clipping of 2.5 .",
    "we thus minimize any contamination or over - correction of the actual planetary phasecurves by the polynomial flattening and excluded the occultations .",
    "we then concatenated these flattened curves using the ` kepstitch ` routine , which created one long timeseries , containing all used quarters of data ( see table [ tbl : used_quarters ] ) .",
    "finally , using the ` kepfold ` task , we folded the entire lightcurve by the published orbital periods of each planet to get the phase curve , that was used in the next steps of our data analysis .",

    "the depth of the secondary eclipse to be positive , along with the other fitted amplitudes , usually imparts a modeling bias towards higher positive values and more significant detections , especially if the signal is just above the noise level .",

    "a quick literature search for these targets from our sample showed that this effect can be explained by a shift of the reflection signal , due to the superrotation phenomenon @xcite . in order to also model this higher order effect for these few exceptional systems , we added a component to the model lightcurve for ( only ) these three targets .",
    "this shift in the phase curve caused by planetary clouds ( @xcite ) for kepler 7b , 12b and 43b was modeled in a similar fashion to the phase curve itself , where we added an additional free parameter @xmath78 to describe the phase shift :    @xmath79    using this model to modify @xmath33 ( updating equation 8 with equation 22 ) we found significant phase shifts @xmath78 for koi-20.01 , koi-97.01 and koi-135.01 ( see [ sec : koi20 ] , [ sec : koi97 ] , and [ sec : koi135 ] ) .      for some of the planets in our sample we did not detect a secondary eclipse and/or a phase curve . in these cases we were only able to give upper limits for the derived parameters ( see section [ sec : non_detect ] ) . in other cases",
