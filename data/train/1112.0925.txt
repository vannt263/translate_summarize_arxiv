    "is the easiness to realize the strong coupling of a discrete quantum system to a macroscopic number of external degrees of freedom , simply by contacting a single atom or molecule to metallic electrodes . while standard physical effects such as screening of the molecular charging energy  @xcite and renormalizations of the atomic energy levels from quantum tunneling  @xcite can occur , these electronic setups opens a window to realize even more subtle many - body physics .",
