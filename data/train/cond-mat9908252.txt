    "have been proposed ( see  @xcite and refs . therein ) .    however , until now the possibility to design an all - dielectric microstructure displaying total omnidirectional reflection has mainly been associated with 3d periodic materials . in spite of current success in the microstucturing of 3d photonic crystals  @xcite ,",
    "there is still a serious technological problem to fabricate a periodic structure of arbitrary wavelength - scale period .",
    "the investigations of low dimensional periodic media have been attracting considerable interest .",

    "the common feature of the band structure of 1d lattices is that the forbidden gaps are always closed up ( e. g. the crossed circles in figure  [ pbgk ] ) .",
