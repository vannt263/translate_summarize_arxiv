    "panda is an international collaboration .",
    "the acronym stands for antiproton anihilation darmstadt and the objective for this collaboration is to increase the understanding of the strong force .",
    "the facility , at which the research is conducted , is located at gsi ( gesellschaft fr schwerionen ) in darmstadt , germany .",
    "over 30  years ago , the gsi laboratory was founded ; the goal was to build a research facility for nuclear physics and related areas .",
    "the construction of a new heavy - ion accelerator soon attracted scientists from all over europe , and since the upgrade 15 years ago , gsi has evolved into an international research centre using beams of heavy - ions up to en energy of 2 agev .",
    "today there are plans for a major new research facility at gsi",
    ". the new facility will provide a range of particle beams from proton and antiproton beams to ion beams up to uranium .",
    "the extension will mainly consist of a new 100/200  tm double - ring synchrotron referred to as sis100/200 and storage rings for collecting and cooling the beam as well as for phase space optimization and experiments .",
    "research with antiprotons , hadron spectroscopy and hadronic matter will be conducted in the new facilities to gain a greater knowledge of the strong force . when colliding protons and antiprotons into each other , particles with gluonic degrees of freedom are produced .",
    "studies of these particles , such as precision measurements of the mass , width and decay branches of charmonium aim to seek answers to questions like `` where does the mass of a nucleon come from ? '' .",
    "charmonium will be studied carefully at gsi since the coupling constant of this meson is not too large and relativistic problems are considered to be manageable .",
    "another interesting property of charmonium is that the mass of the charm quark is large enough to motivate the use of perturbative qcd ( quantum chromo dynamics ) and still small enough to keep the non - perturbative corrections .",
    "the reaction chain in which the charmonium hybrid state @xmath5 is created , will eventually end with only photons and electrons as the final products , as shown below.@xcite    @xmath6    the reaction chain described above ends with seven gammas , one electron and one positron .",
    "the gammas can only be detected using an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) of nearly 4@xmath7 solid angle coverage .",
    "as charged particle detectors must be positioned closer to the target than the electromagnetic calorimeter , the radius for this detector grows considerably and thousands of scintillator crystals will be needed .",
    "the electrons and positrons can be detected using either an ecal or a charge sensitive detector .",
    "it is required that the ecal has a high resolution and a sufficiently fast response to detect all particles created in the decay chain .",
    "my role in the panda - project has been to perform measurements on chinese and russian crystals in germany to investigate their energy resolution and to determine if the crystals match the desired energy resolution of @xmath8 .",
    "this report treats both the physics behind the experiment and the connection to the research pursued at gsi in darmstadt .",
    "firstly , the reader will be guided through the theory and background to the experiments .",
    "the reader will be introduced to the panda experiment as well as the reason to , and function of , electromagnetic calorimeters .",
    "the preparations in giessen and the measurements in mainz will be presented in chapters [ giessen ] and [ mainz ] , as well as the experimental set - up , methods used and the obtained results . finally , a summary and outlook will be presented .",
    "the matter in nature is made up of two fundamental groups of building blocks .",
    "these non - excited elementary particles all have spin 1/2 and are called fermions .",
    "the fermions are either _ leptons _ or _ quarks_. in total , six leptons and",
    "six quarks have been found . according to their properties ,",
    "these have been classified in three generations , or flavours .",
    "the leptons are called @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the first three leptons carry the charge -e while the last three , called the neutrinos , have no charge .",
    "each lepton has the same flavour , or belongs to the same generation , as its corresponding neutrino .",
    "in addition to these leptons there exist six antiparticles .",
    "they are called @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the charged leptons interact via both the electromagnetic force and the weak force , while the neutral leptons interact weakly .",
    "the six quarks occur in flavours consisting of two particles , just like the leptons .",
    "the quarks are called up- , down- , strange- , charm- , top- and bottom quarks .",
    "each generation consists of a quark with charge @xmath21 and a quark with charge @xmath22.@xcite    a single quark has never been found , this phenomenon is called confinement . instead ,",
    "the quarks stick to each other in formations called _ hadrons_. hadrons consisting of two quarks are called _ mesons _ , hadrons consisting of three quarks are called _",
    "baryons_.    to ensure that the quarks obey the pauli principle , one must have a way to discern them quark from another .",
    "the quarks have therefore been allotted colour charges .",
    "they carry either red , blue or green colour , while the antiquarks carry anti - red , anti - blue or anti - green .",
    "the interaction binding the quarks into hadrons is called the strong interaction and the mediator of this force is the _",
    "gluon_. the gluons couple to the colour charge carried by the gluons in the same way as the electromagnetic force couples to the charge of particles .",
    "the gluons carry colour and anticolour simultaneously.@xcite      particles interact via something called _",
    "mediators_. a mediator is a particle that is exchanged in the interaction process . to depict the interactions in a pedagogical way , _",
    "feynman diagrams _ are often used .",
    "these are diagrams showing both time and space and each symbol in this diagram corresponds to a certain matrix element .",
    "there are certain rules connected to feynman diagrams .",
    "the time axis usually runs upwards , while the space axis runs from left to right .",
    "different kinds of lines characterize different particles in the interaction process .",
    "straight lines correspond to wave functions of fermions , while antiparticles are depicted having arrows pointing backwards in time .",
    "photons have wavy lines , heavy vector boson have dashed lines and gluons have corkscrew - lines .",
    "the particles interact at the point called the _",
    "vertex_. if more than three particles meet , the points are called _",
    "vetices_. at this point energy , momentum and electric charge must be conserved . here",
    ", particles not being present in the initial state often show up .",
    "these are called _ virtual particles _ and do not have to satisfy the energy conservation law since they live for a very short period of time .    for each vertex",
    "there is a transition amplitude that contains a factor @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 is a dimensionless strength parameter which is independent of the particle types involved in the process , though it depends on what interaction is taking place .",
    "the @xmath24 value for the strong interaction is 1 , while the values for the weak and electromagnetic forces are @xmath25 and 1/137 respectively.@xcite if there are three vertices in an interaction process , the probability for this interaction to take place is @xmath26.@xcite      quantum electrodynamics , or qed , is the quantized , relativistic theory of electrons and positrons in interaction with the electromagnetic field . the electromagnetic force acts on large distances and the mediator responsible for this interaction is the spin-1 boson called the photon .",
    "quantum chromodynamics , qcd , is the theory of the quark ( and gluon ) interaction and it focuses on the strong force .",
    "this force , acting between quarks , is much stronger than the electromagnetic force and it also acts on much smaller distances .",
    "the particles responsible for the interaction are in this case the eight massless spin-1 bosons called gluons .",
    "these interact with the quarks in the nuclei.@xcite      the four elementary interactions known are the strong force , the weak force , the electromagnetic force and gravitation .",
    "the electromagnetic force and the weak force have been combined into what is called the electroweak force and one is working on a theory on how to combine the remaining two . the _ standard model _",
    "is a name for the existing model of elementary particles and their interactions .",
    "it comprises both the theory of the electroweak interaction and quantum chromodynamics .",
    "the force mediators are the gluons , the photons , the vector bosons @xmath27 and @xmath28 and possibly the graviton which has not yet been discovered .",
    "since the gluons couple to colour and carry colour as well as anticolour , the gluons couple to themselves.@xcite      gluons attract other gluons because of the colour ( or anticolour ) they carry . instead of spreading out in space like the electric field lines between charges ,",
    "the gluons are `` trapped '' in something called a flux tube that links the quarks .",
    "the harder one tries to separate the quarks , the stronger the field in between them gets .",
    "it would simply take an infinite amount of energy to completely separate the quarks .",
    "the only known way to break the gluon flux tube is to take the energy stored in the field and create two new coloured quarks.@xcite    coloured objects are never seen in nature , this applies to both quarks and gluons and the phenomenon is called confinement .",
    "combinations e.g. of many gluons should on the other hand be possible to observe .",
    "these could consist of many gluons combining to colour neutral particles e.g. a blue / anti - red and a red / anti - blue gluon .",
    "three jet events in electron - positron annihilations are a strong indication for their existence . in such annihilation processes two new quarks that spread in opposite directions are ( thought to be ) created . as the quark and",
    "antiquark `` escape '' each other , new mesons and baryons are created as jets .",
    "therefore an odd number of jets must originate from gluons .",
    "gluons seem to be able to emit other gluons as well .",
    "_ exotic particles _ is a name for hadrons other than mesons and baryons , including particles with excited gluonic fields .",
    "the particles with exotic gluonic fields are either so - called _ glueballs _ or _",
    "the glueballs consist only of gluons , while the hybrids consist of excited gluons as well as quarks.@xcite      the glueball is thought to have a very small radius - in the range of @xmath29 m , a hadron has a diameter of approximately @xmath30m.@xcite since no free coloured objects exist , glueballs must be colour neutral objects .",
    "the glueball is predicted to consist of at least two gluons carrying for instance blue / anti - red and red / anti - blue colour .",
    "another option is three gluons combining to a so - called white object .",
    "the three gluons making up the glueball would then be for instance red / anti - blue , green / anti - red and blue / anti - green .",
    "there is nothing preventing more complex formations to exist either .",
    "glueballs may also consist of more than a two or three gluons as long as the resulting particle is colour neutral .",
    "the existence of glueballs has not yet been proven though several models predict them .",
    "calculations using qcd are not easy to perform ( but have been done ) and thus massive simulations using the most modern model , called lattice qcd , have to be conducted .",
    "using lattice qcd simulations , time - space is regarded as a grid , called a lattice . in these simulations quarks and antiquarks",
    "are connected by lines .",
    "the results from these simulations show that gluons actually do turn up.@xcite    glueballs with exotic quantum numbers ( quantum numbers that are forbidden for ordinary mesons and fermion - antifermion systems ) are called _",
    "oddballs_. since they can not mix with mesons they should be easier to identify than glueballs .",
    "the hybrids are made up of both quarks and excited gluons .",
    "an example of this mixing could possible be a quark carrying red colour , an anti - blue antiquark and a blue / anti - red gluon .",
    "this results in a `` white '' particle .",
    "when using lattice qcd to find indications of hybrids , one has found an interesting property of the meson .",
    "this property occurs if the lines linking the quarks and antiquarks in the simulation program are not stretched out enough .",
    "what happens is that a slack in the line between the particles arise and the configuration may start to spin like a jumping rope . in these situations",
    "one can think of an extra gluon being attached to the meson .",
    "this increases the energy and the hybrid will be more energetic than the original meson .",
    "the detection of the charmonium hybrids in the decay channel discussed in chapter [ intro ] is one of the prime objectives of panda .",
    "this hybrid consists of a charm quark , an anticharm quark and gluonic excitations .",
    "three very interesting things to study in the research area of hadron physics are : confinement , the creation of mass and the search for new forms of matter .",
    "the fact is that only about 2@xmath31 of the nucleon mass is made up of quark masses .",
    "the rest must be connected to the kinetic energy and the interaction energy of the quarks making up the nucleus .    to fully understand the three phenomena mentioned above , physicists need a greater understanding of the strong force .",
    "they plan to collide protons with antiprotons and thereby create new , short - lived particles .",
    "one possibility is to create charmonium , a meson consisting of a charm quark and an anticharm quark .",
    "scientists thereby hope to gain some understanding to the strong force and find evidence of the existence of glueballs and hybrids.@xcite      today , the facility at gsi consists of a linac ( linear accelerator ) , a heavy - ion synchrotron sis18 and an experimental storage / cooling ring ( esr ) .",
    "the new facility will have two separate synchrotron accelerator rings , both with a circumference of about 1100 m .",
    "the new facility will as well be complemented by three additional storage rings ; the cr ( collector ring ) , the nesr ( new experimental storage ring ) and the hesr ( high - energy storage ring ) .",
    "the new detectors needed at gsi have to be of top quality to identify the correct masses , nuclear charges , energies , momentum , angles etc .",
    "the detector for the proton - antiproton collisions must be designed to accept as many as @xmath32 annihilations per second and simultaneously allow for triggering on rare events with very low cross - section .    for complete information on e.g. spectroscopy measurements and the reconstruction of invariant masses from neutral and charged decay products , a nearly full coverage of the solid angle",
    "is required . for particle identification",
    "it is as well very important to have excellent energy and angular resolution , both in the case of charged particles and for photons.@xcite      the reason for studying charmonium , instead of any other meson , in the panda collaboration is that the charmonium states are very narrow and separated .",
    "the cross - sections for the prediction of these states are high , the relativistic effects are small and perturbative methods can be applied . by analogy",
    "one can say that the charmonium is `` the positronium of qcd '' @xcite . by",
    "that one means that both positronium ( the bound state of an electron and a positron ) and charmonium are systems consisting of a particle and its antiparticle , the difference is the force acting between them.@xcite    charmonium states often end up in an electron - positron final state .",
    "these states are sometimes accompanied by photons and to detect these photons , a new and powerful electromagnetic calorimeter is needed .",
    "an illustration of the proposed panda detector ( including an electromagnetic calorimeter ) labeled `` calo '' in yellow in figure [ fig : panda ] .",
    "ecals are used to detect and measure the energy and impact point of photons , electrons and positrons with energies above 100  mev .",
    "the detection principle is based on registering the total absorption of the electromagnetic shower @xcite , which comprises secondary particles created in bremsstrahlung and pair production processes inside the detector .",
    "calorimeters can be constructed as homogeneous devices or in a sampling mode , when only part of the shower energy is detected in active detectors and the major part just absorbed in high density material .",
    "the optimum resolution can be obtained for homogeneous calorimeters using liquid noble gases or high density and fast scintillation crystals .",
    "the ecal of panda is supposed to be built with scintillating crystals covering all showers .",
    "the close arrangement of crystals will detect the full energy of the cascade created by an incoming photon .",
    "the crystals produce visible wavelength photons when incoming photons excite the detector material .",
    "the produced light can then be converted into electrical signals using photo sensors such as photo multiplier tubes or avalanche photo diodes .",
    "the ecal detects both the energy and the momentum of the particle .",
    "the resolution of the momentum measurements decreases linearly with the momentum of the particle while the energy resolution increase as a function of @xmath33 .    to identify the detected particle , mass and charge are in most cases sufficient .",
    "the momentum is obtained by deflecting the particle in a magnetic field and reconstructing the track in a position sensitive detector volume consisting of straw tubes or gas detectors such as a tpc ( time projection chamber ) .",
    "the mass is usually obtained by additional measurements.@xcite      in general , the interaction of the incoming photons with the detector material depends strongly on the energy of the incoming photons . if the incoming photons have a high energy , this interaction process will generate secondary particles which themselves generate new particles .    a _ shower _ or a _ cascade _ will be formed in cases where the incoming photon energy is high .",
    "initially , a phenomenon called pair production will occur and when the energy has decreased , processes like the photoelectric effect and compton scattering will take over .",
    "the shower process spreads in all directions but prominently in the longitudinal one @xcite .",
    "the shower is generated by high - energy electrons or photons which lose energy due to _ bremsstrahlung _ when the particle interacts with the detector material and photons are emitted .",
    "translated into english `` bremsstrahlung '' becomes braking radiation .",
    "+ bremsstrahlung occurs as particles are accelerated and slowed down by the electric field from the nuclei in matter.@xcite    the amount of energy lost in bremsstrahlung depends on the mass and charge of the particle according to equation [ eq : brems ] @xcite .",
    "@xmath34    @xmath35 is the lost energy , e is the energy of the particle and @xmath36 is the distance traveled by the particle . at medium energies",
    "only electrons and positrons have such low mass that the cross - section becomes significantly large .",
    "_ pair production _ is the interaction process between incoming particles and matter that requires the highest energy @xcite . in this process",
    "the incoming photon converts into an electron - position pair .",
    "bremsstrahlung then occurs and the newly formed electron ( or positron ) will be deviated and a photon will be emitted .",
    "this shower , or cascade process , continues until the critical energy @xmath37 of the particles is reached . at this electron energy ,",
    "the cross - section of bremsstrahlung becomes similar to that of pure ionization .",
    "therefore , no further secondary photons are generated and the shower is stopped .",
    "the critical energy depends on the proton number ( atomic number ) z of the detector material.@xcite a material with a high z - value , such as lead tungstate , corresponds to a low critical energy .",
    "@xmath38    at energies below a few  mev , losses are dominated by the _",
    "photoelectric effect _ and _ compton scattering_. in the photoelectric effect , the photon is absorbed by the atom as a whole and an electron carrying the energy is emitted . in",
    "compton scattering the photon scatters off from an atomic electron .",
    "the photoelectric effect and compton scattering are both processes in which the photons lose energy by collisions with the atomic electrons .",
    "this in turn causes ionization of the atoms in the material .    concerning the performed experiments in mainz , pair production was the dominant interaction process for the incoming high energy photons , while the photoelectric effect and the compton scattering were dominant in the end of the shower processes .",
    "in connection to the showers , the radiation length should also be mentioned .",
    "the radiation length is physically described as the distance over which the energy of an incoming electron decreases by a factor of @xmath39 @xcite . for a photon , this distance can be said to correspond to the distance over which there is an approximate probability of 54% for a @xmath40-ray to perform pair production .",
    "the radiation length @xmath36 has an asymptotic value for each material at sufficiently high energies and is given by equation [ eq : radlen].@xcite    @xmath41    in [ eq : radlen ] , m represents the mass of an electron , c is the speed of light , @xmath42 is planck s constant divided by @xmath43 , z is the atomic number , @xmath24 is the coupling constant and @xmath44 is the density of atoms per @xmath45 in the material .",
    "the radiation length for @xmath46 crystals is approximately 0.9 cm @xcite .",
    "materials with a high z - value have a short radiation length .",
    "this is a desired property since it decreases the calorimeter depth and reduces the overall dimensions of the detector .",
    "this is particularly important if all components have to be installed inside a superconducting solenoid , such as in case of panda .",
    "di - electrons ( @xmath47 pairs ) and photons will be detected with an electromagnetic calorimeter made of @xmath46 crystals .",
    "the panda electromagnetic calorimeter will consist of four parts : the barrel , the backward endcap , the forward endcap and the forward spectrometer .",
    "the inner part of the barrel will have a diameter of 50 cm and it will contain more than 9000 crystals .",
    "both endcaps will consist of approximately 4 - 5000 crystals .",
    "the final geometry and granularity has not been fixed yet .",
    "simulations however suggest a minimum depth of 20 cm and a typical cross - section of 2 cm , similar to the moliere radius of the crystals .",
    "the moliere radius is quantity that describes the electromagnetic interaction properties .",
    "it is often used when describing the transversed dimensions of electromagnetic showers in a material @xcite .",
    "the forward spectrometer is located 7 meters downstream of the target .",
    "it will have an approximate area of 3 @xmath48.@xcite      the @xmath46 crystals have some very attractive features : they are fast scintillating crystals with a short decay time @xmath49 10ns , a short radiation length ( 0.9 cm ) and a moliere radius of 2.2 cm .",
    "the short decay time allows experiments at high count rates and a fast digitization even for developing low level trigger information @xcite .",
    "however , the luminescence yield correspond to only approximately 1% of nai(tl ) crystals .",
    "due to thermal quenching , the luminescence yield can be significantly increased by operating the crystals well below room temperature .",
    "the energy resolution of the crystals , @xmath50 , is proportional to @xmath51 where n is the number of detected photons . due to the possibilities to increase the light yield of the crystals ,",
    "a detailed research program has been started to significantly improve it .",
    "an envisaged high granularity enhances the detector resolving power with respect to position reconstruction and a minimized pile - up probability .",
    "the @xmath46 crystals are in addition very compact since their radiation length is short .",
    "this is a desired feature since a lot of money and space can be saved by building smaller detectors .",
    "the crystals used in the measurements in mainz were grown by the company sic at shanghai , china and the bogoroditsk techno - chemical plant , russia .",
    "the chinese crystals were tapered and had a length of 12 cm , foreseen as prototypes for the proposed photon ball at cosy , jlich , germany . as a rule of thumb",
    ", the crystals should have a length of 15 - 20 radiation lengths and the dimensions of these crystals may therefore indicate bad results .",
    "the light yield of the chinese crystals was approximately 10 photoelectrons / mev .",
    "the second array consisted of recently grown crystals from sic as well as bogoroditsk .",
    "both kinds had the same dimensions , @xmath52 and a significantly improved light yield .",
    "the russian samples were produced with improved growing technology and delivered a light yield nearly twice as much as the mass produced crystals delivered for the cms calorimeter at cern .",
    ".the table shows the approximate properties of the chinese and russian crystals used in the experiment in mainz .",
    "the correct dimensions of the chinese crystals can be seen in figure [ fig : chrystals ] . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      one as well may want to know how much better it is to use a large array of crystals compared to using only a small one .",
    "this effect can ( in some way ) be seen by comparing the energy resolutions obtained from the raw and summed energy spectra .",
    "these energy resolutions differ a lot .",
    "the two curves describing the resolution can be seen in [ fig : sigdivechsumunsum ] and [ fig : sigdiverusumunsum ] . in both figures",
    ", the energy resolution is obtained from the signal peak",
    ".     comes from the signal peak.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig : sigdivechsumunsum ]     comes from the signal peak.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig : sigdiverusumunsum ]    not summing over the energy contributions in the surrounding crystals obviously gives a worse energy resolution since @xmath53 and @xmath54 have clearly lower values .",
    "this is shown in the graphs .",
    "using three different methods of estimating the energy resolution of the lead tungstate crystals gave three quite different results .",
    "the largest energy resolution was obtained using the fwhm value of the peaks .",
    "this was expected since only parts of the peaks were used to estimate the energy resolution in the two other cases .",
    "the lowest energy resolution was obtained when using the sigma of the signal peak .",
    "the assumption to use only the right side of the energy peak to fit of a gaussian distribution led to an energy resolution between the two other extreme values .    the energy resolution obtained from the fwhm",
    "can be seen as a worst case scenario for the energy resolution since the tail of the peak influences and increases the fwhm value and hence worsens the resolution .",
    "the signal peak on the other hand , can be seen as the ideal case where no energy is lost and the energy resolution indicates what may be achieved with a perfect set - up and instrumentation of a high quality .",
    "the energy resolutions obtained for the russian crystals , taking into account the systematic uncertainties , @xmath55 came close to what was proposed in the conceptual design report report about the crystals to be used at gsi ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the chinese crystals , seem to have a worse energy resolution ( @xmath56 ) dominated by the constant term .    due to the difference in geometry ,",
    "a direct comparison is not possible .",
    "the statistical factors are very similar both for the chinese and russian crystals , which indicates similar luminescence properties .",
    "however , the coefficient before the @xmath57-term is approximately the same as for the russian crystals , especially if one considers the uncertainty in this value .",
    "the term @xmath54 represents light output of the crystals and photon statistics and it should be smaller for the russian crystals due to the higher light yield .",
    "the term @xmath53 describes the performed calibration , the set - up properties and time dependent parameters such as temperature or count rate changes or the various effects due to light collection or shower leakage . due to the tapered shape of the chinese crystals , a larger part of the shower escapes and",
    "thus the leakage is larger and the value of this term increases .    although the result came close to the desired energy resolution stated in the cdr , the energy resolution of the crystals was not as good as expected .",
    "previous measurements of @xmath46 crystals , conducted in 1997 in giessen , germany @xcite , resulted in an energy resolution of @xmath58 .",
    "this value was obtained for a @xmath4 array of crystals , but without any cooling of the crystals .",
    "improvements have been done since then , both in the light yield of the crystals and in cooling techniques . the light yield has improved by a factor of two and",
    "the cooling has improved the light yield with a factor of three .",
    "that should result in an energy resolution that is a factor @xmath59 lower than for the previous measurement .",
    "this seems not to be the case and it is therefore very important to repeat the measurements .",
    "the crystals should then not be individually wrapped and one must ensure an excellent optical contact between the crystals and the read - out devices . also a proper pmt set - up should be used in order to collect as many photons as possible . in addition one must verify , or optimize , the linear response of each detector by measuring the response to low energy gamma sources as a function of position along the axis of the crystal .",
    "the objective of this thesis was to determine the energy resolution of two sets of recently developed crystals .",
    "the crystals will be used to detect gammas ( and electrons ) in an electromagnetic calorimeter at the future upgrade of the gsi facility .",
    "the gammas used in the experiment ranged in energy between 64  mev and 715  mev .",
    "the crystals were irradiated by eight photon energies in this interval and the signals from the crystals were read out using pmts .",
    "the energy spectra obtained in the experiment showed eight peaks , one corresponding to each photon energy used .",
    "the peaks were all asymmetric with a tail to lower energies . due to the asymmetry ,",
    "the sigma of the peaks was obtained using three different methods .",
    "firstly , the fwhm of the peak was used .",
    "next , two different gaussian distributions were fitted to the peak in order to describe the asymmetry .",
    "one of them represented events where no energy escapes the detector while the other one represented the energy lost in the wrapping material and as well the energy leaking out of the detector .",
    "at last , a gaussian function was fitted to mainly the right side of the peak .",
    "the sigma from the fwhm turned out to give the largest energy resolution while the sigma from the signal function gave the lowest .",
    "the right side fit resulted in an energy resolution somewhere in between the other two values .",
    "the use of two sets of crystals with different shape and light yield resulted in two different sets of results of the energy resolution . using crystals with a length of approximately 17 radiation lengths and",
    "a higher light yield gave a lower energy resolution .",
    "the energy resolution from the right side fit for the russian crystals was estimated to be @xmath1 , this value comes very close to the value written in the conceptual design report , @xmath3 .",
    "the chinese crystals were found to have an energy resolution of @xmath2 .",
    "using the fwhm of the peaks gives a very bad resolution .",
    "using the signal peak gives a very low and desirable resolution but it is somehow unclear how one could obtain such a narrow and symmetric energy peak .",
    "the right side fit seems to be most appropriate since the energy value obtained using that method is between the two extremes .",
    "the result in this case is significantly improved compared to measurement using crystals of minor quality . in spite of a smaller volume",
    "the achieved resolutions are very close to values obtained for a @xmath4 matrix with identical read - out but operated at higher temperatures . nevertheless , the improvement of the light yield of a factor two compared to former crystals , which is valid for the russian as well as the chinese samples of 15 cm length , as well as the operation at -24  degrees  celsius should have led to an even better results .",
    "one should have expected an increase of the light yield by a factor @xmath59 , which should much further reduce the statistical factor @xmath54 in the parametrization of the relative energy resolution .",
    "the final energy resolution of the crystals was obtained using a method ignoring the low energy tail of the energy peaks . to really understand and explain the existence of this tail , simulations would be needed .",
    "it is clear that the dead material is partly responsible for it , but other explanations are needed as well .",
    "the simulations may also provide an opportunity to verify the use of more than one function to describe the shape of the energy peaks .",
    "possibly , they could also support the decision to use the two gaussian method and as well justify the assumption that the signal peak may be the ideal energy resolution to strive for .",
    "another important reason for conducting simulations would be to investigate exactly what size of the crystal array is needed to collect all the showers in the detector .",
    "simulations in these areas were begun but due to lack of time , no proper results were obtained .",
    "the only conclusion one could draw from those simulations was that an array larger than the @xmath0 array used in the experiments was needed .",
    "this was especially important for photon energies of high energy , when deposits in the surrounding crystals were larger .",
    "the thickness of the wrapping layer was as well varied in the simulations to investigate whether this influenced the amount of energy deposits .",
    "no conclusions could be drawn in this case since the z - value of the wrapping material was so much lower compared to that of the crystals .",
    "this means that the wrapping material is not capable of collecting very many photons and that they instead escape the detector .",
    "hence this factor did not noticeably affect the depositions .",
    "since the energy resolution obtained in the experiment was good , but not as good as expected due to the improvements made since the last time the experiments were performed , new experiments are required . in the new experiments it is important to minimize the amount of dead material in the detector and if possible ,",
    "exclude the individual wrapping of the crystals .",
    "it is also important to assure a good optical contact between the crystals and the read - out devices and to use a proper pmt set - up that is more stable than the one used in mainz .",
    "this will most likely increase the amount of detected photons and improve the energy resolution of the crystals .",
    "as the crystal manufacturing develops , crystals with a higher light yield than the one used in this experiment are expected in the near future .",
    "this will drastically impact the energy resolution .",
    "it has , at a late stage of this thesis , come to my knowledge that the asymmetry of the peaks could be better described with the so - called novosibirsk function , rather than with two gaussian distributions .",
    "this function looks like a gaussian distribution but has a low energy tail . applying it to the fit of the energy peaks may very well yield a better description of the energy resolution and it would therefore be best to repeat the fitting with this function .",
    "i would like to thank rainer novotny at the justus liebig university in giessen for giving me the opportunity to participate in the experiments in giessen and mainz and for answering my never - ending questions with such patience .",
    "he has also been very helpful with giving me comments and feedback on my report .",
    "finally , thank you ulrich for providing me the opportunities to conduct my master thesis in such an interesting way and for letting me present my results at the collaboration meeting at gsi .",

    "<S> the particle beam facility called gsi , located in darmstadt ( germany ) , will within a few years be upgraded with a new complex of accelerators . at the new storage ring hesr , the panda experiment aims to study antiproton induced reactions . </S>",
    "<S> the electromagnetic calorimeter will constitute a major part of the experimental set - up . </S>",
    "<S> the detector will be used to detect photons and is planned to consist of thousands of scintillating crystals .    in this thesis , </S>",
    "<S> the energy resolution of crystals and its dependence on the incoming energy has been investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the crystals used were first prototype crystals of a new generation , characterized by a higher light yield . </S>",
    "<S> two crystal types with different shape and light yield , manufactured by suppliers in china and russia , were used .    </S>",
    "<S> an experiments were performed on two arrays of @xmath0 crystals . </S>",
    "<S> photon beams of eight different energies , ranging from 64  mev to 715  mev , were directed into the center crystals . due to the development of electromagnetic showers the energy </S>",
    "<S> was deposited over all nine crystals . </S>",
    "<S> photo multiplier tubes were used to read out the response of the scintillators .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy peaks obtained in the experiment were not entirely symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> the general line shape of the experimental energy response was a gaussian with an asymmetric tail towards lower energies due to energy losses . from this line shape one </S>",
    "<S> can get a measure of the width , sigma , of the peak . in this thesis , </S>",
    "<S> the sigma value was obtained using three different methods :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> fwhm ( full width half maximum ) 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> two gaussian method 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> right side fit    all three methods result in different energy resolutions and the goal was to determine which method describes the course of events most accurately .    </S>",
    "<S> the fwhm method is used whenever one is dealing with non - gaussian distributions . the second method is a method in which the asymmetric energy peak is represented by two different gaussian distributions . </S>",
    "<S> this method reproduces more accurate the line shape of the energy peaks due to the energy losses caused by the wrapping material and the statistical fluctuations of the amount of energy escaping the limited detector volume . </S>",
    "<S> the right side fit is a method where only the right side of the peak is fitted with a gaussian function and the tail on the left side of it is completely ignored .    </S>",
    "<S> the real energy resolution does not depend on what method is used in describing it . </S>",
    "<S> it is however important to find a theory that well describes the energy resolution of the crystals used in the experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> calculations showed that using the two gaussian method delivered the lowest sigma value and also the lowest energy resolution . </S>",
    "<S> the fwhm method gave the largest sigma value and also the largest energy resolution . </S>",
    "<S> the right side fit gave an energy resolution with values between the two other methods , thus this method was chosen to describe the crystals . </S>",
    "<S> error bars were estimated from the other two approaches . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained energy resolution for the russian crystals , @xmath1 , was much better than the resolution for the chinese crystals , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it actually came close to what was described in the conceptual design report ( cdr ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the energy resolution mentioned in the cdr , @xmath3 , was obtained for a significantly larger @xmath4 crystal array containing most of the shower . </S>",
    "<S> this response function was determined at a moderate operating temperature of + 8 degrees  c , while the measurements for this thesis were performed at -25  degrees  c. the present result may be limited by a significantly thicker layer of dead material between the crystal elements . therefore the use of the signal peak method might be justified to estimate the overall light output of the crystal array . </S>",
    "<S> separating the expected contribution due to energy losses may very well be reasonable , due to the limited transversal dimensions of the crystal array .    </S>",
    "<S> some simulations were as well performed . </S>",
    "<S> these showed that the showers spread beyond the nine crystals used in the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> this was especially noticeable when incoming photons with a high energy were used . </S>"
