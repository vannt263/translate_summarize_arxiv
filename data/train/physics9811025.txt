    "one of the common goals in the forthcoming experiments is the search for new phenomena . in the forthcoming high energy physics experiments ( lhc , tev22 , nlc , ... )",
    "the main goal is the search for physics beyond the standard model ( supersymmetry , @xmath11- , @xmath12-bosons , ... ) and the higgs boson discovery as a final confirmation of the standard model . in estimation of the discovery potential of the future experiments ( to be specific in this paper we shall use as an example cms experiment at lhc  @xcite ) the background cross section is calculated and for the given integrated luminosity @xmath13",
    "the average number of background events is @xmath14 .",
    "suppose the existence of a new physics leads to the nonzero signal cross section @xmath15 with the same signature as for the background cross section that results in the prediction of the additional average number of signal events @xmath16 for the integrated luminosity @xmath13 .",
    "the total average number of the events is @xmath17 .",
    "so , as a result of new physics existence , we expect an excess of the average number of events . in real experiments",
    "the probability of the realization of @xmath18 events is described by poisson distribution  @xcite    @xmath19    here @xmath20 is the average number of events .",
    "remember that the poisson distribution @xmath21 gives  @xcite the probability of finding exactly @xmath18 events in the given interval of ( e.g. space and time ) when the events occur independently of one another and of @xmath22 at an average rate of @xmath20 per the given interval .",
    "for the poisson distribution the variance @xmath23 equals to @xmath20 .",
    "so , to estimate the probability of the new physics discovery we have to compare the poisson statistics with @xmath24 and @xmath25 . usually , high energy physicists use the following `` significances '' for testing the possibility to discover new physics in an experiment :    * `` significance '' @xmath26  @xcite , * `` significance '' @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "a conventional claim is that for @xmath28 we shall discover new physics ( here , of course , the systematical errors are ignored ) . for @xmath29",
    "the significances @xmath30 and @xmath31 coincide ( the search for higgs boson through the @xmath32 signature ) . for the case when @xmath33 ,  @xmath30 and @xmath31 differ .",
    "therefore , a natural question arises : what is the correct definition for the significance @xmath30 , @xmath31 or anything else ?",
    "it should be noted that there is a crucial difference between `` future '' experiment and the `` real '' experiment . in the `` real '' experiment",
    "the total number of events @xmath34 is a given number ( already has been measured ) and we compare it with @xmath0 when we test the validity of the standard physics .",
    "so , the number of possible signal events is determined as @xmath35 and it is compared with the average number of background events @xmath0 . the fluctuation of the background is @xmath36 , therefore , we come to the @xmath30 significance as the measure of the distinction from the standard physics . in the conditions of the `` future '' experiment when we want to search for new physics , we know only the average number of the background events and the average number of the signal events , so we have to compare the poisson distributions @xmath37 and @xmath38 to determine the probability to find new physics in the future experiment .    in this paper",
    "we estimate the probability to discover new physics in future experiments . we show that for @xmath39 the proper determination of the significance is @xmath40 .",
    "we suggest a method which takes into account systematic errors related to nonexact knowledge of the signal and background cross sections . we also propose a method for the estimation of exclusion limits on new physics in future experiments .",
    "some of presented results has been published in our early paper  @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following . in the next section",
    "we give a method for the determination of the probability to find new physics in the future experiment and calculate the probability to discover new physics for the given @xmath41 numbers of background and signal events under the assumption that there are no systematic errors . in section 3",
    "we estimate the influence of the systematics related to the nonexact knowledge of the signal and background cross sections on the probability to discover new physics in future experiments . in section 4",
    "we describe a method for the estimation of exclusion limits on new physics in future experiments . in section 5",
    "we estimate the probability of new physics discovery in future experiments .",
    "section 6 contains the concluding remarks .",
    "suppose that for some future experiment we know the average number of the background and signal event @xmath42 .",
    "as it has been mentioned in the introduction , the probability of realization of @xmath18 events in an experiment is given by the poisson distribution    @xmath43    where @xmath24 for the case of the absence of new physics and @xmath25 for the case when new physics exists .",
    "so , to determine the probability to discover new physics in future experiment , we have to compare the poisson distributions with @xmath24 ( standard physics ) and @xmath25 ( new physics ) .",
    "consider , at first , the case when @xmath44 , @xmath45 . in this case",
    "the poisson distributions approach the gaussian distributions    @xmath46    with @xmath47 and @xmath48 or @xmath49 . here",
    "@xmath18 is a real number .",
    "note that for the poisson distribution the mean equals to the variance .",
    "the gaussian distribution describes the probability density to realize @xmath18 events in the future experiment provided the average number of events @xmath20 is a given number . in fig.1",
    "we show two gaussian distributions @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath25 = 104 ( @xcite , table.13 , cut 6 ) .",
    "as is clear from fig.1 the common area for these two curves ( the first curve shows the `` standard physics '' events distribution and the second one gives the `` new physics '' events distribution ) is the probability that `` new physics '' can be described by the `` standard physics '' . in other words , suppose we know for sure that new physics takes place and the probability density of the events realization is described by curve ii ( @xmath52 . the probability @xmath53 that the `` standard physics '' ( curve i ( @xmath54 ) ) can imitate new physics ( i.e. the probability that we measure `` new physics '' but we think that it is described by the `` standard physics '' ) is described by common area of curve i and ii .",
    "numerically , we find that    @xmath55dx + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi } \\sigma_1 } \\int_{\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2}^{\\infty}exp[-\\frac{(x-\\sigma_1 ^ 2)^2}{2 \\sigma_1 ^ 2}]dx\\\\    & = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi } } [ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\sigma_1-\\sigma_2}exp[-\\frac{y^2}{2}]dy + \\int_{\\sigma_2-\\sigma_1}^{\\infty}exp[-\\frac{y^2}{2}]dy ] \\\\",
    "\\nonumber & = & 1 - erf(\\frac{\\sigma_2-\\sigma_1}{\\sqrt{2}}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the transformation of the distributions to standard normal distribution and the exploitation of the equality    @xmath58    allows one to find the point @xmath59 of the intersection of the curves i and ii .",
    "let us discuss the meaning of our definition ( 4 ) .",
    "for @xmath60 we have @xmath61 , i.e. the probability density of the standard physics realization is higher than the probability density of new physics realization",
    ". therefore for @xmath62 we do not have any indication in favour of new physics .",
    "the probability that the number of events is less than @xmath59 is @xmath63 . for @xmath64 @xmath65 that gives evidence in favour of new physics existence .",
    "however the probability of the background events with @xmath64 is different from zero and is equal to @xmath66 .",
    "so we have two types of the errors .",
    "for @xmath67 we do not have any evidence in favour of new physics ( even in this case the probabilty of new physics realization is different from zero ) .",
    "for @xmath68 we have evidence in favour of new physics .",
    "however for @xmath64 the fluctuations of the background can imitate new physics .",
    "so the probability that standard physics can imitate new physics has two components @xmath69 and @xmath70 and it is equal to @xmath71 . if @xmath53 equals to @xmath72 the new physics will never to be found in the experiment , if @xmath53 equals to @xmath73 the first measurement with probability one has to answer to the question about presence or absence of the new physics ( this case is impossible for two poisson distributions ) .",
    "note that the other estimator ( normalized @xmath53 ) @xmath74 has the same properties .",
    "it means that the area of intersection of the probability density functions of the pure background and the background plus signal is the measure of the future experiment undiscovery potential .    as follows from formula",
    "( 4 ) the role of the significance @xmath75 plays    @xmath76    note that in refs.@xcite the following criterion of the signal discovery has been used .",
    "the signal was assumed to be observable if @xmath77 upper confidence level for the background event rate is equal to @xmath77 lower confidence level for background plus signal @xmath78 .",
    "the corresponding significance is similar to our significance @xmath79 .",
    "the difference is that in our approach the probability density @xmath53 that new physics is described by standard physics is equal to @xmath80 .",
    "it means that for @xmath81 the probability @xmath53 is correspondingly @xmath82 in accordance with a general picture . as it has been mentioned in the introduction two definitions of the significance",
    "are mainly used in the literature : @xmath26  @xcite and @xmath27  @xcite . the significance @xmath79 is expressed in terms of the significances @xmath30 and @xmath31 as @xmath83 .    for @xmath29 ( the search for higgs boson through @xmath32 decay mode )",
    "we find that    @xmath84    it means that for @xmath85 ( according to a common convention the @xmath86 confidence level means a new physics discovery ) the real significance is @xmath87 , that corresponds to @xmath88 .    for the case @xmath89 , @xmath90 , where for @xmath91 the value of @xmath92 is @xmath93 . for not too high values of @xmath0 and @xmath94",
    ", we have to compare the poisson distributions directly . again for the poisson distribution @xmath95 with the area of definition for nonnegative integers we can define @xmath96 for real @xmath22 as    @xmath97 , < n > ) , & x > 0 .    \\cr   \\displaystyle \\tilde p(x , < n > ) = \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{ll }                 0 ,         & x \\le 0 , \\\\       p([x ] , < n > ) ,         & x > 0 .",
    "\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    it is evident that    @xmath98    so , the generalization of the previous determination of @xmath53 in our case is straightforward , namely , @xmath53 is nothing but the common area of the curves described by @xmath99 ( curve i ) and @xmath100 ( curve ii ) ( see , fig.2 ) .",
    "one can find that    @xmath101    @xmath102    @xmath103    @xmath104 ,    @xmath105.$ ]    numerical results are presented in tables 1 - 6 .",
    "as it follows from these tables for finite values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 the deviation from asymptotic formula ( 4 ) is essential .",
    "for instance , for @xmath106 , @xmath107   @xmath108 . for @xmath109   @xmath110 , whereas asymptotically for @xmath111 we find @xmath112 .",
    "similar situation takes place for @xmath33 .",
    "in the previous section we determined the statistical error @xmath53 ( the probability that `` new physics '' is described by `` standard physics '' ) . in this section",
    "we investigate the influence of the systematical errors related to a nonexact knowledge of the background and signal cross sections on the probability @xmath53 not to confuse a new physics with the old one .",
    "denote the born background and signal cross sections as @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "an account of one loop corrections leads to @xmath115 and @xmath116 , where typically @xmath117 and @xmath118 are o(0.5 ) .",
    "two loop corrections at present are not known .",
    "so , we can assume that the uncertainty related with nonexact knowledge of cross sections is around @xmath117 and @xmath118 correspondingly .",
    "in other words , we assume that the exact cross sections lie in the intervals @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "the average number of background and signal events lie in the intervals    @xmath121    and    @xmath122    where @xmath123 , @xmath124 .",
    "to determine the probability that the new physics is described by the old one , we again have to compare two poisson distributions with and without new physics but in distinction from section 2 we have to compare the poisson distributions in which the average numbers lie in some intervals .",
    "so , a priori the only thing we know is that the average numbers of background and signal events lie in the intervals ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) , but we do not know the exact values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . to determine the probability that the new physics is described by the old , consider the worst case when we think that new physics is described by the minimal number of average events    @xmath125    due to the fact that we do not know the exact value of the background cross section , consider the worst case when the average number of background events is equal to @xmath126 .",
    "so , we have to compare the poisson distributions with @xmath127    @xmath128 and @xmath129 . using the result of the previous section",
    ", we find that for case @xmath130 the effective significance is    @xmath131    for the limiting case @xmath132 , we reproduce formula ( 5 ) . for not too high values of @xmath133 and @xmath134 , we have to use the results of the previous section ( tables 1 - 6 ) .    as an example consider the case when @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 ( typical situation for sleptons search ) . in this case",
    "we find that + @xmath138    @xmath139    @xmath140    @xmath141 + the difference between cms adopted significance @xmath142 ( that corresponds to the probability @xmath143 ) and the significance @xmath144 taking into account systematics related to nonexact knowledge of background cross section is factor 3.6 the direct comparison of the poisson distributions with @xmath145 and @xmath146 ( @xmath147 gives @xmath148 .",
    "another example is with @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath135 .",
    "for such example we have @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 .",
    "so , we see that an account of the systematics related to nonexact knowledge of background cross sections is very essential and it decreases the lhc susy discovery potential .",
    "in this section we generalize the results of the previous sections to obtain exclusion limits on signal cross section ( new physics ) .",
    "suppose we know the background cross section @xmath156 and we want to obtain bound on signal cross section @xmath15 which depends on some parameters ( masses of new particles , coupling constants , ... ) and describes some new physics beyond standard model .",
    "again as in section 2 we have to compare two poisson distributions with and without new physics .",
    "the results of section 2 are trivially generalized for the case of the estimation of exclusion limits on signal cross section and , hence , on parameters ( masses , coupling constants , ... ) of new physics .",
    "consider at first the case when @xmath157 , @xmath158 and the poisson distributions approach the gaussian distributions . as it has been mentioned in section 2",
    "the common area of the gaussian curves with background events and with background plus signal events is the probability that `` new physics '' can be described by the `` standard physics '' .",
    "for instance , when we require the probability that `` new physics '' can be described by the `` standard physics '' is less or equal @xmath159 ( @xmath79 in formula ( 5 ) is larger than 1.64 ) it means that the formula    @xmath160    gives us @xmath161 exclusion limit on the average number of signal events @xmath1 . in general case when we require the probability that `` new physics '' can be described by the `` standard physics '' is more or less @xmath162 the formula    @xmath163    allows us to obtain @xmath164 exclusion limit on signal cross section . here",
    "@xmath165 is determined by the formula  ( 4 )  , @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 , i.e. we suppose that @xmath169 .",
    "it should be stressed that in fact the requirement that `` new physics '' with the probability more or equal to @xmath162 can be described by the `` standard physics '' is our definition of the exclusion limit at @xmath170 probability for signal cross section . from the formula ( 14 )",
    "we find that    @xmath171    for the case of not large values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 we have to compare the poisson distributions directly and the corresponding method has been formulated in section 2 . as an example in table 7 we give @xmath161 exclusion limits on the signal cross section for @xmath172 and for different values of background cross sections .",
    "formulae ( 14 ) , ( 15 ) do not take into account the influence of the systematical errors related to nonexact knowledge of the background cross sections on the exclusion limits for signal cross section . to take into account such systematics we have to use the results of section 3 .",
    "the corresponding generalization of the formulae ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) is straightforward , namely :    @xmath173    @xmath174    remember that @xmath117 describes theoretical uncertainty in the calculation of the background cross section . as an example , in table 8 we give @xmath161 exclusion limits on the signal cross section for @xmath175 and for different values of background cross sections .",
    "note that in refs.@xcite different and strictly speaking `` ad hoc '' methods to derive exclusion limits in future experiments has been suggested .",
    "as is seen from fig.3 the essential differences in values of the exclusion limits take place .",
    "let us compare these methods by the use of the equal probability test  @xcite .",
    "in order to estimate the various approaches of the exclusion limit determination we suppose that the new physics exists , i.e. the value @xmath1 equals to one of the exclusion limits from fig.3 and the value @xmath0 equals to the corresponding value of expected background .",
    "then we apply the equal probability test to find critical value @xmath176 for hypotheses testing in future measurements . here",
    "a zero hypothesis is the statement that new physics exists and an alternative hypothesis is the statement that new physics is absent . after calculation of the type i error @xmath69 ( the probability that the number of observed events will be equal to or less than the critical value @xmath176 ) and the type ii error @xmath70 ( the probability that in the case of absence of new physics the number of observed events will be greater than the critical value @xmath176 ) we can compare the methods . in table 9",
    "the comparison result is shown . as is seen from this table the `` typical experiment '' approach  @xcite gives too small values of exclusion limit .",
    "the difference in the 90%  cl definition is the main reason of the difference between our result and the exclusion limit from ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref  @xcite",
    "is used the criterion for determination exclusion limits : @xmath177 and @xmath178 , where the experiment will observe with probability at least @xmath179 at most a number of events such that the limit obtained at the @xmath180 confidence level excludes the corresponding signal .",
    "if we define @xmath162 as normalized @xmath53 ( @xmath181 ) we have the result close to ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. @xmath182 corresponds to @xmath183 .",
    "in section 2 we determined the probability @xmath53 that `` new physics '' can be described by the `` standard physics '' .",
    "but it is also very important to determine the probabilty of new physics discovery in future experiment . according to common definition @xcite the new physics discovery corresponds to the case when the probability that background can imitate signal is less than @xmath86 or in terms of the probabilty less than @xmath184 ( here of course we neglect any possible systematical errors ) .",
    "so we require that the probability of the background fluctuations for @xmath185 @xmath186 is less than @xmath187 , namely @xmath188 the probability @xmath189 that the number of signal events will be bigger than @xmath190 is equal to @xmath191    it should be stressed that @xmath187 is a given number and @xmath192 is a function of @xmath187 .",
    "usually physicists claim the discovery of phenomenon @xcite if the probability of the background fluctuation is less than @xmath193 that corresponds to @xmath194 .",
    "so from the equation ( 18 ) we find @xmath190 and estimate the probabilty @xmath189 that an experiment will satisfy the discovery criterion .    as an example",
    "consider the search for standard higgs boson with a mass @xmath195 at the cms detector .",
    "for total luminosity @xmath196 one can find @xcite that @xmath197 , @xmath198 .",
    "using the formulae ( 18 , 19 ) for @xmath199 ( @xmath86 discovery criterium ) we find that @xmath200 .",
    "it means that for total luminosity @xmath201 the cms experiment will discover at @xmath202 level standard higgs boson with a mass @xmath203 with a probabilty 96(73 ) percent .",
    "in this paper we determined the probability to discover the new physics in the future experiments when the average number of background @xmath0 and signal events @xmath1 is known .",
    "we have found that in this case for @xmath204 and @xmath205 the role of significance plays        for @xmath209 we have found that @xmath210 . for not too high values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , when the deviations from the gaussian distributions are essential ,",
    "our results are presented in tables 1 - 6 .",
    "we proposed a method for taking into account systematical errors related to the nonexact knowledge of background and signal events .",
    "an account of such kind of systematics is very essential in the search for supersymmetry and leads to an essential decrease in the probability to discover the new physics in the future experiments .",
