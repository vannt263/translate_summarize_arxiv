    "one of the most important principles that underlies much of modern physics is that of copernicus ; that our location in space and time is not special , such that the laws of physics do not change from one point in spacetime to another .",
    "all these laws contain within them a relationship to the fundamental constants ; electromagnetic interactions involve the fine structure constant @xmath19 , gravitational interactions depends on the gravitational constant @xmath23 and so on .",
    "it is therefore a natural question to ask whether these constants are constant with cosmic epoch .",
    "this question is not a new one , being proposed some 70 years ago by dirac @xcite and milne @xcite .",
    "since then however it has become of particular interest with the development of physical models that seek to unify the fundamental forces via extra dimensions , such as kaluza  klein , or superstring theories ( see e.g. @xcite , for a review of theoretical models ) .",
    "these extra dimensions would have only manifested themselves in the first instant of time following the big bang ( @xmath24 seconds , or energies of @xmath25 gev ) before compactifying to the planck scale during the cosmic expansion that followed .",
    "the constants of nature as we observe them in our 4 dimensional spacetime can be shown to depend on their integral properties over all existing dimensions @xcite , and as such variations in the scale factors of these now compactified extra dimensions over cosmic time could manifest themselves physically in our 4d universe as an evolution of the fundamental constants .    whilst the nature of the potential evolution of these extra dimensions is not well",
    "understand , with models existing for increasing , decreasing , or oscillating scale lengths ( see e.g. @xcite ) , a measurement showing any evolution of the constants would provide supporting evidence for the existence of compact dimensions .",
    "the current best terrestrial estimates on the evolution of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the proton to electron mass ratio , come from @xcite of @xmath26 yr@xmath27 and @xcite of @xmath28 yr@xmath27 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : finalresults ]    table  [ table : finalresults ] summarises our results for @xmath17 for both approaches - calculating the single joint model that maximises the evidence , and marginalising over all possible models .",
    "errors for the single fit are given as @xmath29 values , whilst the result for marginalising over the posterior is given as a 99@xmath10 confidence interval .",
    "our value of @xmath17 for j1148 + 5251 of @xmath30 is the result of a velocity offset with a 99@xmath10 confidence interval of @xmath31 km s@xmath27 .",
    "thus in order to account for the offset from zero we would require that either the interstellar medium has an intrinsic velocity dispersion much greater than expected , or the two species are positioned in such a way that their profiles are consistent , but their relative velocities are significantly offset . from fig . [ figure:1148profiles ] , we can see that the data obtained for the co  ( @xmath1 ) line only just extends beyond the width of the line .",
    "there is the possibility then that the baseline level for this emission line has an additional component that is not easily visible from the data .",
    "we therefore allowed the continuum component of the [ c  ii ] and co lines to vary independently for j1148 + 5251 to see how this affected the outcome of the fit .",
    "the result was that it did not ; the [ c  ii ] and co fitted continuum components of @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively , with @xmath34 as before .",
    "for the br1202@xmath40725 qso our value for @xmath17 of ( @xmath35 results from a velocity offset of @xmath36 , which is consistent with our estimates of the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the two species .    finally for the br1202@xmath40725",
    "smg the best fit model we found a velocity offset of @xmath37 km s@xmath27 , whilst the marginalised posterior had multiple peaks between a range of @xmath38 and @xmath39 km s@xmath27 .",
    "this is the result of attempting to fit a joint model to the two emission lines where the evidence strongly favours different profiles for each .",
    "we note that the range of the offset in velocity seen in the marginalised posterior is roughly consistent with the difference in the widths of their profiles when fitted independently ( @xmath40 300 km s@xmath27 )    if we want to reach a limit of @xmath41 using co and [ c  ii ] we will therefore need to sample large numbers of high @xmath42 objects in order to reduce the error associated with the random motions of the gas to @xmath40 0.3 km s@xmath27 and address other factors such as differing ( both gas and dust ) opacities . to go from even a modest estimate of this random motion of @xmath43 km s@xmath27",
    ", this would require @xmath40 1000 sources , assuming gaussian statistics .",
    "alternatively , spatially resolved imaging could be performed on a number of sources , thereby providing multiple , independent line - of - sight measurements for each source .",
    "we could also choose to use two species whose spatial distributions are believed to be more closely tied , but that are still detectable with high signal to noise at comparable look back times , for example @xcite use a combination of c  i and co  ( @xmath44 ) emission from a @xmath45 qso host galaxy to derive limits on @xmath17 of @xmath46 .",
    "finally if we compare our results to the proposed angular dipole distribution @xcite , j1148 + 251 lies in a region with @xmath47 with @xmath48 the angular separation with respect to the dipole , and so we would expect @xmath49 .",
    "given @xmath50 , if we take @xmath51 we find @xmath52 which is consistent with the value predicted by the dipole .",
    "br1202@xmath40725 however lies almost orthogonal to the dipole with @xmath53 and so does not produce any stringent tests on the claim .      out of the three systems investigated only the [ c  ii ] and co(j = 2@xmath541 ) transition lines from j1148",
    "+ 5251 were seen to be consistent with one another within the limits of the data , however we note that the co(j = 2@xmath541 ) emission line also had the lowest signal to noise of any of the data presented here . the co  ( j = @xmath3 ) and [ c  ii ] emission lines from the br1202@xmath40725 qso and smg however were both seen to have intrinsically different profiles , where in both cases the co  ( j = @xmath3 ) was approximately 30@xmath10 wider than the [ c  ii ] . as such",
    "we propose that for individual systems the differences in the redshifts @xmath9 of the co and [ c  ii ] emission lines can not be viewed as being solely due to the evolution of the fundamental constants , but must include a contribution owing to the intrinsically different spatial distributions of the two species of gas within the galaxy .",
    "we have presented a series of sensitive observations of molecular co and [ c  ii ] emission in 3 high redshift galaxies ; the qso host j1148 + 5251 at @xmath2 and the qso host br1202@xmath40725 at @xmath5 along with it s companion smg .",
    "we have used these to quantify the differences in the two emission line profiles for each system and thus put constraints on the quantity @xmath6 in two distinct ways ; calculating the bayesian evidence for a joint model using shapelets and determining the separation in redshift between those models , and by marginalising over all model parameters to calculate the posterior distribution associated with @xmath9 independent of any particular model choice .",
    "we found that the line profiles for the co  ( @xmath3 ) transition for the br1202@xmath40725 qso and smg were inconsistent with the [ c  ii ] , being approximately 30@xmath10 wider whereas the co  ( @xmath1 ) and [ c  ii ] emission lines for j1148 + 5251 were consistent within the limits of the data .",
    "this suggests that , in agreement with existing high resolution observations , whilst the co and [ c  ii ] might largely trace the same components of the host galaxy , there are still observable differences between their line profiles .",
    "as such a direct conversion from @xmath9 to the quantity @xmath17 in order to constrain the evolution of fundamental constants for an individual system using these two species of gas is problematic , with our results being fundamentally limited by this unknown factor that represents the relative distributions and velocities of the gas within the host galaxy .",
    "such issues are potentially eliminated either with large sample sizes to reduce the random error , or by observing different species that are more closely linked . in either case",
    ", the sensitivity of alma will allow large numbers of co and [ c  ii ] detections at high redshift to mitigate the issue , allowing us to reduce the uncertainty in the evolution of the fundamental constants at these distant look back times to the level of @xmath55 , on a par with methods used at lower redshifts ."
