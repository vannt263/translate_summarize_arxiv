    "in this paper we study constructions of contact forms on closed orientable manifolds . an intricate question of contact",
    "topology is whether any closed almost contact manifold admits a contact structure .",
    "it is solved positively only in dimensions three and five @xcite . however , even in low dimensions , this is usually very non - trivial to construct explicitly a contact form on a given almost contact manifold .",
    "there are some obvious classes of almost contact manifolds .",
    "first of all , the product of an almost complex manifold @xmath1 ( more generally , a stably almost complex manifold of even dimension ) with a contact manifold @xmath2 is almost contact .",
    "it is known that @xmath3 is contact if @xmath1 is an orientable surface and @xmath2 is contact ( see @xcite for the case of genus @xmath4 and @xcite for @xmath5 ) .",
    "our aim and the principal motivation was to understand the case of @xmath1 closed and of arbitrary dimension .",
    "there is a simple case when a contact form exists on @xmath6 let @xmath7 be an exact symplectic manifold ( i.e. , its symplectic form is exact , @xmath8 and @xmath9 be a contact form on @xmath10 then the product form @xmath11 is contact .",
    "where @xmath12 are projections , but to simplify the notation we omit projections .",
    "for the same reason wedge signs are omitted in exterior products of forms . ]",
    "exact symplectic manifolds are necessarily open , so this can not be applied directly to closed manifolds . however ,",
    "if @xmath1 is compatibly decomposed into the sum of exact symplectic pieces , then there is a formula @xcite which yields a contact form on @xmath13 to be a bit more precise , @xmath1 is assumed to be a sum of exact symplectic cobordisms which meet at their convex ends and agree on their common boundaries .",
    "thus @xmath1 is cut by a hypersurface and along it the symplectic forms of adjacent pieces yield a fold .",
    "we call such decomposition a strong symplectic fold of convex type ( see section [ prel ] for the precise definition and comments on the formula ) .",
    "theorem [ mainth ] says that the product of a manifold with strong symplectic fold of convex type with a contact manifold is contact and it is the base for further construction and applications .",
    "the proof has two main ingredients : the giroux - mohsen @xcite theorem which states that any contact form can be deformed to a contact form given by an open book decomposition , and the heat flow deformation of a confoliation to a contact form given by altschuler and wu @xcite .",
    "open books together with the geiges - stipsicz formula enable us to define a confoliation and the heat flow applied to it gives a contact form .",
    "then we extend this theorem in two ways .",
    "first , we allow some bundles over the exact symplectic pieces . in particular",
    ", we prove that there exists a contact form on the total space of any bundle over a strong symplectic fold with contact fiber if some rather natural conditions are satisfied .",
    "for instance , this holds for any bundle over @xmath14 if the structure group preserves the contact form of the fiber .",
    "secondly , we show that in @xmath1 one can allow also concave folds , i.e. , the fold is given by two concave ends of symplectic cobordisms ( see section [ conc ] ) .",
    "we give a number of examples and applications .",
    "they include products @xmath15 provided that @xmath2 is a contact manifold and @xmath16 is even and @xmath17 if @xmath1 is a strong symplectic fold of contact type and @xmath16 is odd .",
    "we show also examples of homogenous spaces which are contact but have no invariant contact forms .",
    "moreover , we show that some surgeries and blowing ups preserve contactness ( cf .",
    "proposition [ surgery ] and example [ blow ] ) .",
    "we describe also a generalization of the open book construction of contact forms ( see section [ genopen ] ) .    to give a sample of applications , consider the following fillability question .",
    "any contact form @xmath18 on @xmath2 yields the form @xmath19 on @xmath20 $ ] with symplectic exterior differential ( called symplectification of @xmath21 @xmath22 is called fillable , if there exists a symplectic form on a manifold @xmath23 with @xmath24 equal to @xmath25 on a collar of the boundary .",
    "there are obstructions to fillability , in particular in dimension 3 no overtwisted form is fillable .",
    "however , there is an interesting and natural weaker question whether the product form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the standard orientation form of @xmath28 , extends to a contact form on @xmath29 in proposition [ exttodisk ] we construct such extensions from @xmath30 to @xmath31 for some forms on @xmath32 if @xmath33 one can use as @xmath18 also some overtwisted forms .",
    "this shows that after multiplying with @xmath28 the obstruction to fillability disappears , at least for some classes of contact forms . this is a new proof of a result of etnyre and pancholi @xcite .",
    "see section [ furapp ] for details .",
    "the constructions of contact forms on bundles over strong symplectic can be localized .",
    "this leads to a class of decompositions into fibered pieces which are still sufficient to get contactness . in appendix",
    "a we give a preliminary version of this .",
    "we will study such notion together with its applications in a future paper .",
    "appendix b contains sample computations in low dimensions performed using mathematica .",
    "the authors would like to thank jonathan bowden , diarmuid crowley and andrs stipsicz for interesting comments and pointing out an incorrect statement in the previous version of this paper .",
    "we consider compact , smooth , orientable manifolds and we want to find constructions of smooth contact forms on a possibly large class of manifolds .",
    "geiges and stipsicz @xcite gave a formula which yields a contact form on products @xmath34 for some closed @xmath1 .",
    "let us describe their construction in a slightly more general setup .",
    "we start with the definition of a structure which is crucial for our main theorem .",
    "a strong symplectic fold structure of convex type on a compact manifold @xmath1 is a decomposition @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a hypersurface in @xmath37 together with exact symplectic forms @xmath38 on respectively @xmath39 such that the forms satisfy the following convexity conditions on a tubular neighborhood @xmath40 $ ] of @xmath41 and at @xmath42 :    1 .",

    "the closure of every component of @xmath50 containing a component of @xmath42 is an exact symplectic cobordism ( by ( [ ssf2 ] ) , it is necessarily convex at the @xmath51end ) , either convex or concave at the component of @xmath52    the hypersurface @xmath41 is called _ the fold locus . _",
    "the product @xmath53 $ ] endowed with the form @xmath54 is called the _ symplectization _ of a contact form @xmath18 on @xmath55 hence , in the above definition we assume that on both sides of @xmath41 we have symplectizations of @xmath56 if the liouville vector field of @xmath57 is transverse to @xmath49 then one can deform the symplectic forms to symplectizations .",
    "an obvious example is the double @xmath58 where @xmath23 is a compact manifold with boundary and @xmath23 admits an exact symplectic form satisfying convexity condition ( [ ssf2 ] ) at @xmath59 . note that a strong symplectic fold does not determine the orientation , since the orientations given by the symplectic forms on any two adjacent components of @xmath50 are opposite .    in our terminology",
    "we follow ana da silva @xcite .",
    "she shows that on any closed stably almost complex manifold there exists a symplectic fold , i.e. a 2-form which is symplectic everywhere except for a hypersurface , where the form has fold singularities .",
    "a symplectic fold is globally defined and smooth .",
    "it is symplectic outside a hypersurface and gives opposite orientations on any two adjacent parts .",
    "however , in general the symplectic forms are not exact and the behavior along the singular hypersurface differs from what we require for strong symplectic folds . for instance , symplectic folds do not need give contact forms on the singular hypersurface .",

    "they use @xcite where it is shown that any closed orientable 4-manifold admits a strong symplectic fold of convex type .",
    "we want to use the above formula when the circle is replaced by a general contact manifold @xmath10 for this purpose it is necessary to have a pair of contact forms on @xmath2 defining opposite orientations and connected by a path of forms with controlled disruption of contactness .",
