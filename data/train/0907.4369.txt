    "deep  surveys with  and  have provided a unique perspective on the cosmic evolution of accreting supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) and high - energy activity from normal galaxies ( e.g. , star - formation processes , evolving stellar binaries , and hot gas cooling ) over significant fractions of cosmic history ( see fig",
    ".  1 and brandt & hasinger 2005 for a review ) . due to limitations originating from point - source confusion for  at flux levels below @xmath0@xmath9  , the deepest views of the extragalactic  universe have come exclusively from deep  surveys with exposures .",
    "the deepest  surveys to date are the @xmath02  ms  deep field - north (; alexander  2003 ) and @xmath02  ms  deep field - south (; luo  2008 ) surveys ( hereafter , the  deep fields ; cdfs ) .",
    "these have been supplemented by additional deep surveys ( e.g. , the @xmath0250  ks extended  [ ; lehmer  2005 ] and the 0.20.8  ms extended groth strip [ ; laird  2009 ] ) , which cover larger solid angles than the cdfs and provide important information on rarer source populations .",
    "these deep  surveys have been chosen to lie at high galactic latitudes in regions of the sky that have relatively low galactic columns ( @xmath1010@xmath11  @xmath12 ) and few local sources in the field , as to gain a relatively unobscured and unbiased perspective of the distant ( @xmath13 ) universe . despite these growing resources , there has not yet been an equivalent survey targeting very high - density regions of the @xmath14 universe where the most massive smbhs and galaxies are thought to be undergoing very rapid growth ( e.g. , kauffmann  1996 ; de  lucia  2006 ) . in order to address this limitation and",
    "study the growth of smbhs and galaxies as a function of environment , we have carried out a deep @xmath0400  ks  survey ( pi :  d.  m.  alexander ) of the highest density region in the @xmath1 ssa22 protocluster .     plane .",
    "each survey has a range of flux limits across its solid angle ; we have generally shown the most sensitive flux limit .",
    "this plot has been adapted from fig .  1 of brandt & hasinger ( 2005 ) to show the part of parameter space most relevant for ssa22 ; see table  1 of brandt & hasinger ( 2005 ) for references and descriptions of many of the surveys plotted here .",
    "the gray curves show contours regions of the flux limit versus solid angle plane where @xmath0100 , 1000 , and 10,000 sources are expected to be detected ( based on the bauer  2004 number counts relation ) .",
    ", width=340 ]    the @xmath1 ssa22 protocluster was originally identified by steidel ( 1998 ) , who found a significant overdensity ( @xmath046 times higher surface density than the field ) within an @xmath0@xmath15  arcmin@xmath7 region ( @xmath0@xmath16 comoving mpc@xmath7 at @xmath17 ) through spectroscopic follow - up observations of @xmath18 candidate lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) .",
    "theoretical modelling indicates that the protocluster will evolve into a rich cluster with a total mass @xmath19@xmath20  at the present day ( e.g. , coma ; see steidel  1998 for details ) . since its discovery",
    ", the protocluster has also been found to contain a factor of @xmath06 overdensity of ly@xmath2 emitters ( laes ; steidel  2000 ; hayashino  2004 ; matsuda  2005 ) and many remarkable bright extended ly@xmath2-emitting blobs ( labs ; steidel  2000 ; matsuda  2004 ) , which are believed to be sites of massive galaxy formation powered by starburst / agn outflows ( e.g. , bower  2004 ; geach  2005 , 2009 ; wilman  2005 ) .",
    "therefore , ssa22 is an ideal field for studying how smbh growth depends on environment in the @xmath21  1 universe .",
    "in addition to the lbg and lae surveys , ssa22 has become a premier multiwavelength survey field .",
    "the region has been imaged from space by in a sparse mosaic of 12 acs pointings using the f814w filter and by over the entire field in four irac bands ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0@xmath22 m ) and at 24@xmath22 m by mips ( see fig .  2 )",
    ". additionally , the ground - based observations are extensive and include imaging at radio ( 1.4  ghz from the vla ; chapman 2004 ) , submm ( scuba 850@xmath22 m , aztec 1.1 mm , and laboca 870@xmath22 m ; chapman  2001 ; geach  2005 ; tamura  2009 ) , near - infrared ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 bands from ukirt and subaru ; lawrence  2007 ; uchimoto 2008 ) , and optical wavelengths ( e.g. , subaru @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and nb497 bands ; hayashino  2004 ) . a variety of spectroscopic campaigns have been conducted ( e.g. , at kitt peak , subaru , keck , and the vlt ; steidel  2003 ; matsuda  2005 ; garilli  2008 ; chapman  2009 , in - preparation ) and others are currently underway .      thus far",
    ", we have utilised the  and multiwavelength data presented here to conduct two scientific investigations including ( 1 ) lehmer ( 2009 ) , which finds that the growth of galaxies and smbhs in the @xmath1 protocluster environment is enhanced by a factor of over that found in @xmath8 field galaxies ( i.e. , in the cdfs ) , and ( 2 ) geach  ( 2009 ) , which uses the  data to study the host galaxies of labs and concludes that agn and star - formation activity provide more than enough uv emission to power the extended ly@xmath2 emission .",
    "additional follow - up investigations and scientific studies are planned and will be presented in subsequent papers .    in this paper , we present  point - source catalogs and data products derived from the @xmath0400  ks data set .",

    "the observational procedures and data processing were similar in spirit to those presented in lehmer  ( 2005 ) and luo ( 2008 ) ; however , we have made wider use of the  data analysis software package acis extract version  3.131 ( broos  2002 ) while producing our point - source catalogs ( see @xmath313 for further details ) .    throughout this paper , we assume the galactic column density along the line of sight to to be ( e.g. , stark et  al .",
