    "in recent years , gaussian filters have assumed a central role in image filtering and techniques for accurate measurement @xcite .",
    "the implementation of the gaussian filter in one or more dimensions has typically been done as a convolution with a gaussian kernel , that leads to a high computational cost in its practical application .",
    "computational efforts to reduce the gaussian convolution complexity are discussed in @xcite .",
    "more advantages may be gained by employing a _ spatially recursive filter _ , carefully constructed to mimic the gaussian convolution operator . + recursive filters ( rfs ) are an efficient way of achieving a long impulse response , without having to perform a long convolution . initially developed in the context of time",
    "series analysis @xcite , they are extensively used as computational kernels for numerical weather analysis , forecasts @xcite , digital image processing @xcite .",
    "recursive filters with higher order accuracy are very able to accurately approximate a gaussian convolution , but they require more operations .",
    "+ in this paper , we investigate how the rf mimics the gaussian convolution in the context of variational data assimilation analysis .",
    "variational data assimilation ( var - da ) is popularly used to combine observations with a model forecast in order to produce a _ best _ estimate of the current state of a system and enable accurate prediction of future states .",
    "here we deal with the three - dimensional data assimilation scheme ( 3d - var ) , where the estimate minimizes a weighted nonlinear least - squares measure of the error between the model forecast and the available observations .",
    "the numerical problem is to minimize a cost function by means of an iterative optimization algorithm .",
    "the most costly part of each step is the multiplication of some grid - space vector by a covariance matrix that defines the error on the forecast model and observations .",
    "more precisely , in 3d - var problem this operation may be interpreted as the convolution of a covariance function of background error with the given forcing terms .",
    "+ here we deal with numerical aspects of an oceanographic 3d - var scheme , in the real scenario of oceanvar .",
    "ocean data assimilation is a crucial task in operational oceanography and the computational kernel of oceanvar software is a linear system resolution by means of the conjugate gradient ( gc ) method , where the iteration matrix is relate to an errors covariance matrix , having a gaussian correlation structure .",
    "+ in @xcite , it is shown that a computational advantage can be gained by employing a first order rf that mimics the required gaussian convolution .",
    "instead , we use the 3rd - rf to compute numerically the gaussian convolution , as how far is only used in signal processing @xcite , but only recently used in the field of var - da problems .",
    "+ in this paper we highlight the main sources of error , introduced by these new numerical operators .",
    "we also investigate the real benefits , obtained by using 1-st and 3rd - rfs , through a careful error analysis .",
    "theoretical aspects are confirmed by some numerical experiments . finally , we report results in the case study of the oceanvar software . + the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we recall the three - dimensional variational data assimilation problem and we remark some properties on the conditioning for this problem .",
    "besides , we describe our case study : the oceanvar problem and its numerical solution with cg method . in section iii , we introduce the @xmath0-th order recursive filter and how it can be applied to approximate the discrete gaussian convolution . in section iv",
    ", we estimate the effective error , introduced at each iteration of the cg method , by using 1st - rf and 3rd - rf instead of the gaussian convolution . in section",
    "v , we report some experiments to confirm our theoretical study , while the section vi concludes the paper .",
    "the aim of a generic variational problem ( var problem ) is to find a best estimate @xmath1 , given a previous estimate @xmath2 and a measured value @xmath3 . with these notations ,",
    "the var problem is based on the following regularized constrained least - squared problem : @xmath4 where @xmath1 is defined in a grid domain @xmath5 .",
    "the objective function @xmath6 is defined as follows : @xmath7 where measured data are compared with the solution obtained from a nonlinear model given by @xmath8 .",
    "+ in ( [ ls pb ] ) , we can recognize a quadratic data - fidelity term , the first term and the general regularization term ( or penalty term ) , the second one .",
    "when @xmath9 and the regularization term can be write as : @xmath10 we deal with a three - dimensional variational data assimilation problem ( 3d - var da problem ) .",
    "the purpose is to find an optimal estimate for a vector of states @xmath11 ( called the analysis ) of a generic system @xmath12 , at each time @xmath13 given :    * a prior estimate vector @xmath14 ( called the background ) achieved by numerical solution of a forecasting model @xmath15 , with error @xmath16 ; * a vector @xmath17 of observations , related to the nonlinear model by @xmath18 that is an effective measurement error : @xmath19    at each time t , the errors @xmath20 in the background and the errors @xmath21 in the observations are assumed to be random with mean zero and covariance matrices @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "more precisely , the covariance @xmath24 of observational error is assumed to be diagonal , ( observational errors statistically independent ) .",
    "the covariance @xmath25 of background error is never assumed to be diagonal as justified in the follow .",
    "to minimize , with respect to @xmath11 and for each @xmath26 , the problem becomes : @xmath27 in explicit form , the functional cost of ( [ da pb ] ) problem can be written as : @xmath28 it is often numerically convenient to approximate the effects on @xmath29 of small increments of @xmath11 , using the linearization of @xmath30 . for small increments @xmath31 ,",
    "follows @xcite , it is : @xmath32 where the linear operator @xmath33 is the matrix obtained by the first order approximation of the jacobian of @xmath30 evaluated at @xmath14 . +",

    "this gives rise to the linear system : @xmath39 or equivalently : @xmath40 for each time @xmath41 , iterative methods , able to converge toward a practical solution , are needed to solve the linear system ( [ system1 ] ) .",
    "however this problem , so as formulated , is generally very ill conditioned . more precisely , by following @xcite , and assuming that @xmath42 [ lambda_m ] is a diagonal matrix , it can be proved that the conditioning of @xmath43 is strictly related to the conditioning of the matrix @xmath22 ( the covariance matrix ) . in general , the matrix @xmath22 is a block - diagonal matrix , where each block is related to a single state of vector @xmath11 and it is ill conditioned . +",
    "this assertion is exposed in @xcite starting from the expression of @xmath22 for one - state vectors as : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the background error variance and @xmath46 is a matrix that denotes the correlation structure of the background error . assuming that the correlation structure of matrix @xmath46 is homogeneous and depends only on the distance between states and not on positions , an expression of @xmath46 as a symmetric matrix with a circulant form is given ; i. e. as a toeplitz matrix . by means of a spectral analysis of its eigenvalues , the ill - conditioning of the matrix @xmath46 is checked . as in @xcite , it follows that @xmath22 is ill - conditioned and the matrix @xmath43 , of the linear system ( [ system1 ] ) , too . a well - known technique for improving the convergence of iterative methods for solving linear systems is to _ preconditioning _ the system and thus reduce the condition number of the problem .",

    "<S> computational kernel of the three - dimensional variational data assimilation ( 3d - var ) problem is a linear system , generally solved by means of an iterative method . </S>",
    "<S> the most costly part of each iterative step is a matrix - vector product with a very large covariance matrix having gaussian correlation structure . </S>",
    "<S> this operation may be interpreted as a gaussian convolution , that is a very expensive numerical kernel . </S>",
    "<S> recursive filters ( rfs ) are a well known way to approximate the gaussian convolution and are intensively applied in the meteorology , in the oceanography and in forecast models . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we deal with an oceanographic 3d - var data assimilation scheme , named oceanvar , where the linear system is solved by using the conjugate gradient ( gc ) method by replacing , at each step , the gaussian convolution with rfs . here </S>",
    "<S> we give theoretical issues on the discrete convolution approximation with a first order ( 1st - rf ) and a third order ( 3rd - rf ) recursive filters . </S>",
    "<S> numerical experiments confirm given error bounds and show the benefits , in terms of accuracy and performance , of the 3-rd rf . </S>"
