    "to uncover the nature of fluctuations near a bifurcation point has provided a clue to understanding of singularities observed in a rich variety of phenomena .",
    "the most typical example of such studies is the ginzburg - landau theory for equilibrium critical phenomena @xcite . according to this theory , the description of fluctuations in the system that undergoes a pitchfork bifurcation is a starting point for characterizing the ising universality class of the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic transition .",
    "the second example is a theory of collective synchronization in coupled oscillators @xcite . in this phenomenon ,",
    "the mechanism of the cooperative oscillation is explored by studying fluctuations near a hopf bifurcation .",
    "the third example is related to a theory of directed percolation , whose universality class is characterized by a transcritical bifurcation with a multiplicative noise @xcite . from a viewpoint of bifurcation theory , a pitchfork bifurcation , a hopf bifurcation , and a transcritical bifurcation are local co - dimension one bifurcations @xcite .",
    "now , the last one in this type of bifurcations is a saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "mathematically , a saddle - node bifurcation in a differential equation is defined as the appearance of a pair of saddle type fixed point and node type fixed point with respect to change in a system parameter .",
    "this bifurcation has been found in many models such as a mean field model of the spinodal transition @xcite , a model of driven colloidal particles @xcite , bio - chemical network models @xcite , a dynamical model associated with a @xmath0-core percolation problem @xcite , and a random - field ising model @xcite . theoretically , once it is found that a system undergoes a saddle - node bifurcation , its deterministic behavior near the bifurcation point is immediately derived , as seen in standard textbooks @xcite . as an example , a characteristic time scale exhibits divergent behavior proportional to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 represents the distance from the bifurcation point",
    "now , in a manner similar to the other local co - dimension one bifurcations , it is expected that fluctuations near a saddle - node bifurcation exhibits a singular behavior .",
    "thus far , the singular nature of the fluctuations has not been focused on except for some works @xcite , and its theoretical study is still immature compared with much progress in theories of fluctuations near the other bifurcations . however , as we already pointed out @xcite , a stochastic model under a saddle - node bifurcation is regarded as the simplest one of systems that exhibit the coexistence of discontinuous transition and critical fluctuation . such a coexistence has been observed in the dynamical heterogeneity in glassy systems @xcite .",
    "therefore , a theoretical method for describing fluctuations near a saddle - node bifurcation might be useful for studying wider systems including glassy systems ( see sec .",

    "then , the fluctuation intensity @xmath5 of relaxation trajectories exhibits a divergent behavior similar to those observed in the dynamical heterogeneity .",
    "the aim of this paper is to describe this divergent behavior theoretically .",
    "the main idea in our theoretical analysis is to express a single trajectory in terms of a singular part and the others .",

    ", we will be able to consider another theoretical framework for critical fluctuations along with the above - mentioned strategy . concretely , we start with a useful expression of trajectories as we did . in the thermodynamic limit , the equation for the time - correlation function obeys a mode - coupling equation @xcite , and recently we have derived a global expression of the solution near the mode - coupling transition @xcite , which is similar to ( [ phit_assume_model ] ) . from this result , we may express a fluctuating correlator in terms of a goldstone mode @xmath249 associated with the dilation symmetry that arises in the slowest time scale .",
    "thus , it is natural to describe critical fluctuations near the mode - coupling transition in terms of fluctuations of @xmath249 .",
    "the concrete calculation will be reported in future .",
    "the results in this paper also provide some physical insights into the dynamics associated with a mixed order transition even if the calculation has never been performed yet .",

    "a mode - coupling transition occurs at some temperature or density @xcite . in some super - cooled liquids ,",
    "the behavior associated with the transition has been observed approximately @xcite .",
    "the physical picture is well - understood : when the system is near the mode - coupling transition point , a particle can not move freely ; and only when the particle gets over surrounding particles , it can move .",
    "such an event is called an _ unlocking event _ @xcite or a _ bond breakage event _ @xcite .",
    "as the mode - coupling transition is approached , the frequency of unlocking events becomes smaller and the events become correlated more and more in a spatially heterogeneous manner , which is called the _",

    "@xcite as theoretical studies . )    from our point of view , we conjecture that an unlocking event near the mode - coupling transition might correspond to an exiting event from a marginal saddle in some local dynamics .",
    "then , the results of our paper suggest that the most important characterization of the dynamical heterogeneity is space - time fluctuations of exiting time from a saddle - point . at present , it seems difficult to derive such local dynamics theoretically , but it is tempting to connect the idea of cooperative arrangement regions to a marginal saddle in some local dynamics . since the distribution function of exiting time from cooperative arrangement regions exhibits an interesting behavior @xcite , the theoretical derivation of the observation may be a good starting point for the consideration .",
    "the final goal in this direction is to obtain a simple expression determining space - time fluctuations of the goldstone mode on the basis of a microscopic particle model .",
    "we will study it step by step toward this goal .",
    "related to the description of dynamical heterogeneity , we remark on a well - recognized conjecture that the mode - coupling transition described theoretically is nothing but a cross - over phenomenon in finite dimensional systems . in order to understand the nature of this cross - over",

    "when we apply our analysis to a finite dimensional system , in our viewpoint , the cross - over phenomenon is equivalent to the finite value of the expectation of the goldstone mode .",
    "thus , we have only to calculate an asymptotic tail of the effective potential for the goldstone mode in the limit @xmath74 . since the analysis of the super - cooled liquid is too difficult , we should begin with the study of a diffusively coupled model of local dynamics ( [ langevin ] ) with ( [ fformm ] ) .",

    "it would be possible to develop the mean - field analysis of the spatially extended system , but it seems difficult to treat spatial fluctuations accurately even for such a simple system . to develop a systematic theory beyond the mean field analysis is a challenging problem .",

    "such a reformulation is particularly important when we study more complicated systems . in this context",

    "we derive the path - integral expression ( [ path_integral1 ] ) with ( [ path_integral2 ] ) from the langevin equation ( [ langevin ] ) with ( [ gauss_noise_model ] ) .",
    "in particular , we carefully discuss the derivation of the so - called jacobian term .",
    "let @xmath459 be a sufficiently small time interval .",
    "we discretize ( [ langevin ] ) as @xmath460\\frac{{\\delta t}}{2}{\\nonumber\\\\}&&+\\xi_{n-1}{\\delta t}+o(({\\delta t})^2 ) , \\label{model : dis1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath461 . here",

    "we remark on a discretization method .",
    "one may notice that another discretized expression @xmath478 does not yield the jacobian term , because in this case the determinant of the jacobian matrix @xmath479 does not depend on @xmath3 .",

    "we here note that @xmath486 .",
    "this leads to @xmath487 in the limit @xmath488 .",
    "therefore , ( [ final2 ] ) is not useful in the limit @xmath489 . with regard to the discretization problem ,",
    "we remark that numerical simulations of the discretized form ( [ model : dis2 ] ) yield ( [ scaling_t3 ] ) and ( [ scaling_t4 ] ) , too . here",
    ", one may confirm that ( [ scaling_t3 ] ) and ( [ scaling_t4 ] ) can not be obtained without the jacobian term in ( [ path_integral2 ] ) within the analysis of the path integral expression .",
    "therefore , this example provides an evidence for the claim that the path integral expression in the limit @xmath475 always contains the last term in ( [ path_integral2 ] ) .",
    "we estimate the integral @xmath408 given in ( [ i : cont ] ) . before the estimation , we need to evaluate @xmath338 . we multiply by @xmath490 on both sides of ( [ eq:1 ] ) and integrate them over @xmath491 .",
    "we then consider the @xmath186-stationary state and extract the lowest order terms . by using ( [ rho - exp ] ) , we derive @xmath492 where the contribution from the fourth and fifth terms in the right hand side of ( [ eq:1 ] ) have been neglected , because they are estimated as higher order terms . from ( [ rho - exp ] ) , ( [ rho_1/2_green ] ) , and ( [ green ] ) , we obtain @xmath493",
    "since the most singular behavior arises around @xmath330 , we estimate @xmath494 in the limit @xmath261 by noting ( [ green_explititform ] ) .",
    "the first term in ( [ ave_rho_app_0 ] ) is estimated as @xmath495 , where @xmath19 is the length scale over which the integral is dominant . by using @xmath496 ( see ( [ def_m_pm ] ) ) , we estimate the first term of ( [ ave_rho_app_0 ] ) as @xmath497 similarly , the second term in ( [ ave_rho_app_0 ] ) is estimated as @xmath498 thus , we write @xmath499    from this result , the quantity @xmath408 in ( [ i : cont ] ) is estimated as follows .",
