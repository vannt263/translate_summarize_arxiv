    ". a recent discussion on the singularity of global strings can be found in @xcite . in what follows",
    "we shall always stay in proximity of the core of the vortex where the solution is well defined .",

    "this permits us to suppose that the smooth components @xmath44 do not depend explicetely on the string width parameter @xmath10 .",
    "this metric is reminiscent to the _ smooth cone metric _ which was introduced in @xcite , the difference being that here the functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 are determined by the matter via equations ( [ 10 ] ) , ( [ 11 ] ) and that the parameter @xmath10 is a physical parameter .",
    "we introduce coordinates @xmath45 , ( @xmath46 ) which are well defined at @xmath26 , @xmath47 then metric ( [ 12 ] ) becomes , @xmath48 where the components of @xmath49 and their determinant @xmath50 are given by the following expression , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the totally antisymmetric levi - civita symbol , @xmath53 stands for the induced geometrical quantities of the 2-dimensional surface @xmath54const .",

    "the closer we are to the central line @xmath26 the more the vortex @xmath0 resembles the straight vortex @xmath69 .",
    "it is plausible then to suppose that the correction function @xmath68 is analytic in the vortex interior @xmath70 and non null on the central line @xmath26 .",
    "in fact since @xmath71 we can take for instance @xmath72 .",
    "by using definition ( [ 20 ] ) the equation of the central line of a general vortex of arbitrary shape has been found in the minkowski spacetime @xcite .",
    "we shall follow this method to determine the equation of the central line of a vortex of arbitrary shape embedded in a space - time described by a class of metrics ( [ 14 ] ) . in order to do this",
    "we shall calculate the @xmath16 limit of the @xmath0-field equation ( [ 2 ] ) leaving the width parameter @xmath10 fixed .",
    "taking into account ( [ 8 ] ) our vortex solution becomes , @xmath73 on the other hand the dalembertian of @xmath0 for metric ( [ 14 ] ) can be expanded in the following way : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the determinant of the @xmath60 components .",
    "we insert solution ( [ 21 ] ) in expression ( [ 22 ] ) . taking the @xmath0-field equation ( [ 2 ] ) at the @xmath16",

    "it gives the relation between the mean curvature @xmath83 and the field of the global vortex .",
    "for completeness since we are in the presence of gravity we must also consider the einstein equations for @xmath16 . indeed on using ( [ 17 ] ) , ( [ 19 ] ) and on considering that the functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 in ( [ 6 ] ) are solutions of the straight vortex einstein equations ( [ 11 ] ) we obtain for @xmath26 : @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 where @xmath87 stands for geometrical quantities issued from the metric @xmath60 which in this case are just the induced quantities on the world sheet @xmath26 .",
    "let us note that equation ( [ 27 ] ) gives a relation between the geometry of the world sheet and the correction function of the field whereas the einstein equations ( [ 28])-([30 ] ) can be interpreted as constraint equations on the extrinsic curvature of the world sheet .    indeed constraint equations are also obtained for a curved global vortex embedded in the minkowski spacetime .",
    "we remark that the vortex we have considered has no twist since we have omitted cross terms in metric ( [ 14 ] ) . in this",
    "simple case equations ( [ 28])-([30 ] ) are just the gauss - codazzi integrability conditions for flat spacetime ( see for example @xcite ) : @xmath88 where equation ( [ 30 ] ) is identically verified .",
    "in the sections that follow we shall establish an equation of motion for a curved global string , that is for a vortex with width parameter @xmath10 going to @xmath89 .",
    "it is evident that the width parameter @xmath10 must play a leading role in this process .",
    "we shall now place ourselves in the vicinity of the boundary of the vortex core considering that the distance @xmath13 from the central line of the vortex is of the same order as @xmath10 . in consequence when we shall vary @xmath10 ,",
    "the distance @xmath12 shall vary in the same way so that : @xmath90 in this section we shall proceed in the manner of @xcite in classifying in powers of @xmath10 geometrical and matter quantities .",
    "it is very important to note that @xmath91 , @xmath10 or coordinates @xmath92 on the core boundary are now of the same order , whereas the polar angle @xmath93 remains arbitrary .",
    "let us first of all remark that the straight vortex solutions are of @xmath89-order in @xmath10 , @xmath94 since they only depend on the quotient @xmath95 .",
    "let us also point out that the straight vortex solutions @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 have no longer the @xmath16 asymptotic behavior ( [ 6 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) because although @xmath39 varies very little between @xmath89 and @xmath12 , the functions @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath31 can vary essentially in this interval .",
    "the metric components given by spacetime ( [ 14 ] ) are of @xmath89-order , @xmath99 the same holding for their inverse and the determinant , @xmath100 .",
    "we can calculate the non - null christoffel coefficients for @xmath101 , @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 @xmath105 we recall that @xmath87 and @xmath53 stand for quantities derived from @xmath60 and @xmath49 respectively .",
    "notice also , that @xmath106-terms are always of @xmath89-order in @xmath14 .",
    "we now proceed in calculating the ricci tensor for @xmath101 .",
    "since this involves the second derivatives of the metric we shall obtain terms up to the second order in @xmath14 , @xmath107 therefore for the capital indices we have , @xmath108,\\ ] ] and @xmath109,\\ ] ] where we have put , @xmath110 we do not give the explicit form of @xmath89-order terms in @xmath14 since they will not be needed in the following .",
    "the cross terms are of zero order in @xmath14 @xmath111 finally for the small case indices we have for @xmath13 : @xmath112 and @xmath113    we note that @xmath114 and @xmath115 are just the non - zero components of the ricci tensor for the straight vortex ( cf",
    "ii ) , multiplied by @xmath116 and @xmath117 respectively .",
    "this fact will be important for the next section .",
    "let us now proceed in the same way in order to classify matter .",
    "our vortex solution ( [ 20 ] ) is now written for @xmath13 : @xmath118 and so is of @xmath89-order in @xmath14 .",
    "the first and second derivatives of the straight vortex are respectively of first and second order in @xmath14 , @xmath119 whereas the derivatives of @xmath68 are of 0-order in @xmath14",

    "we consider the coupled system of the @xmath0-field and einstein equations ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) for @xmath13 .",
    "let us first examine the @xmath0-field equation : @xmath139 we focus our attention to the correction function @xmath68 . as we mentioned in sec .",
    "iii the correction function is supposed analytic for @xmath140 and so can be expanded around @xmath26 .",
    "this reflects the fact that unlike the straight vortex solution @xmath31 , the correction @xmath68 varies on a larger scale so can be evaluated on @xmath13 by its values on @xmath26 just like the metric components @xmath116 in ( [ 18 ] ) .",
    "we have , @xmath141 where @xmath142 .",
    "so the potential term is written , @xmath143.\\ ] ] introducing ( [ 75 ] ) in ( [ 74 ] ) and using ( [ 72 ] ) , the @xmath121 terms cancel out since they are issued from the straight vortex equations ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "this leaves the @xmath14 as leading terms in the @xmath0-field equation ( [ 74 ] ) which can now be written for @xmath13 , @xmath144_{|l = l_0}\\right]e^{i\\theta}\\psi\\nonumber\\\\ -&1/\\epsilon&\\left\\{\\phi^3\\re e\\left[(\\partial_z\\psi)_{|l=0}\\frac{z_0}{\\epsilon}\\right]\\right\\}\\psi e^{i\\theta}+0(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^0})=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on writing the correction function @xmath68 in form ( [ 26 ] ) we split up the above equation in its real and imaginary part .",
    "we then let @xmath17 and since @xmath145 we get inputing the mean curvature by formula ( [ 25 ] ) , @xmath146\\\\ & & + \\phi'(\\frac{l_0}{\\epsilon})\\frac{\\rho^a_0}{l_0}(k_a+2\\partial_a\\mu)_{|l=0 } + \\frac{\\epsilon\\phi(\\frac{l_0}{\\epsilon})}{l_0b}\\left[\\frac{\\rho_0 ^ 2}{l_0}(\\partial_1\\nu)_{|l=0}-\\frac{\\rho_0 ^ 1}{l_0}(\\partial_2\\nu)_{|l=0}\\right]=0\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath147 \\frac{\\rho_{0}^a}{l_0}(\\partial_a\\nu)_{|l=0}\\nonumber\\\\&&- \\frac{\\epsilon\\phi(\\frac{l_0}{\\epsilon})}{l_0b } \\left[\\frac{\\rho_0 ^ 2}{l_0}(k_1 + 2\\partial_1\\mu)_{|l=0}-\\frac{\\rho_0 ^ 1}{l_0}(k_2 + 2\\partial_2\\mu)_{|l=0}\\right]=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we now make use of the equation ( [ 27 ] ) for the central line of the vortex , and so equation ( [ 80 ] ) gives : @xmath148\\frac{\\rho_{0}^a}{l_0}(\\partial_a\\nu)_{|l=0}=0\\ ] ] which is valid for all @xmath149 depending on an arbitrary angle .",
    "hence @xmath150 inserting the above in ( [ 79 ] ) we find in the same way that @xmath151 so in the limiting case of a string where @xmath17 the general equations ( [ 27 ] ) reduce to the nambu - goto equations of motion , @xmath152    since we are in the presence of gravitation we must also examine the einstein equations for @xmath13 .",
    "first of all the cross - term einstein equations give us : @xmath153 hence from ( [ 67 ] ) when @xmath17 we get @xmath154 and on replacing @xmath68 from ( [ 26 ] ) it is easy to see that @xmath155 hence the correction functions @xmath80 and @xmath81 are constant when the width parameter @xmath10 goes to zero .    for the @xmath156 and @xmath157 einstein equations the @xmath121 terms cancel out from the straight string einstein equations ( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "this leaves us just as for the @xmath0-field equation with the @xmath14 as leading terms in the expansion of the einstein equations .",
    "furthermore in the limit when @xmath17 we have found in the previous paragraph that the correction function @xmath68 is constant and thus the energy - momentum components of order @xmath14 ( [ 61 ] ) and ( [ 65 ] ) drop out .",
    "hence in the limiting case , the einstein equations multiplied by @xmath10 simply give @xmath158 we have that ( [ 17 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) can be also written @xmath159 therefore on inserting the above in ( [ 51 ] ) and ( [ 56 ] ) the einstein equations give , @xmath160=0\\ ] ] @xmath161 where @xmath162 is a coefficient depending uniquely on the polar angle .",
    "now the nambu - goto equation of motion ( [ 84 ] ) , @xmath163 , annihilates equation ( [ 90 ] ) but not ( [ 89 ] ) .",
    "in fact in order for ( [ 89 ] ) to be verified either the global string must be totally geodesic @xmath164 , or the coefficient of the extrinsic curvature , the function @xmath138 given by ( [ 52 ] ) , must be null at @xmath13 .",
    "the function @xmath138 is given in terms of the straight vortex solution so it is totally determined . by means of a graphic numerical solution",
    "we can search the zeros , if any , of this function .",
    "in the following figure obtained by numerically solving the straight vortex equations ( [ 10 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) we see that the function @xmath138 is strictly negative except for the flat case which corresponds to the origin ( @xmath165 , @xmath166 ) .",
    "so in the presence of gravitation when the width parameter @xmath17 the global string is totally geodesic , that is @xmath164 .",
    "with a reasonably general form of the metric ( [ 14 ] ) describing a self - gravitating global vortex having an arbitrary shape , we have obtained results concerning the equations of motion of the central line of the global string .    in the first part of this work , we study a global vortex of width parameter @xmath11 .",
    "we find a general equation ( [ 27 ] ) between the mean curvature @xmath83 and the field of the global vortex for the world sheet of the central line , @xmath26 .",
    "constraint equations ( [ 28]-[30 ] ) for the extrinsic curvature of the world sheet are issued from the einstein equations .    in the second part",
    ", we consider the @xmath0-field and einstein equations at a distance from the centre of the vortex of order @xmath10 .",
    "we make the assumption that the higgs boson mass is large , i.e. @xmath17 . from the @xmath0-field equations , we deduce ( [ 79 ] ) and ( [ 80 ] ) .",
    "moreover by using ( [ 27 ] ) we obtain the nambu - goto equation of motion @xmath163 for the global string .",
    "however in the presence of gravitation the einstein equations give ( [ 89 ] ) and ( [ 90 ] ) which restrain the global string to be totally geodesic , i.e. @xmath164 . so the presence of gravitation does not permit the curving of the global string .    in @xcite using as a string model a thin tube of undetermined matter we have found a condition for which the self - gravitating string has the nambu - goto dynamics .",
    "however this condition corresponding here to @xmath167 can not be fulfilled in the presence of gravitation for the case of a global string .",
    "it has been shown , @xcite in minkowsky space - time that the equation of motion of a global string is the nambu - goto equation corrected by a term resulting from the radiative backreaction .",
    "for example in the review @xcite the authors write in the conformal gauge the following equation of motion ( cf .",
    "( 75 ) ) : @xmath168 with @xmath169 where @xmath170 is a fixed renormalisation scale and @xmath171 is the energy integral within the core of the global vortex .",
    "when the higgs mass is large we see that the radiative part becomes negligeable .",
    "equation ( [ * ] ) becomes the nambu - goto equation of motion , @xmath163 which is in accord with our result in the absence of gravitation .",
    "the authors would like to thank u. ben - yaacov for useful discussions in vortex dynamics during his visit in tours .",
    "we would also like to thank b. carter for bringing to our attention difficulties concerning global strings .",
