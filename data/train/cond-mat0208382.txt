    "a generalization of classical boltzmann thermodynamics as recently introduced by tsallis @xcite has offered a beautiful way of describing the statistics of a multitude of physical systems , which generally involve some sort of long - range interactions , ranging from astrophysics @xcite to low dimensional dissipative chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "systems described by this thermodynamics are often referred to as  non - extensive  . this same modification of classical thermodynamics also seems to offer a natural understanding of the subject of anomalous diffusion .",
    "anomalous diffusion can be thought of the propagation of particles which are restricted to move on a certain subspace of full two or three space , such as for example the propagation of water molecules in a sponge , or the flow of crude oil in porous soil . in this work",
    "we argue that the motion of living and interacting epithelial cells can be seen as a variant of anomalous diffusion on a network which changes over time .",
    "we support the idea by experimental evidence .",
    "our experimental findings moreover strongly support very recent work on movements of interacting hydra cells @xcite .",
    "a living epithelial cell e.g. in two - dimensional cell culture is not a static object but moves continuously , a process which is called cellular migration @xcite .",
    "cell migration is of vital importance in physiological processes such as wound healing or understanding cancerogenesis .",
    "for example , intact mammary gland tissue is stable during phases of milk secretion . in residual phases of female estrous cycle , however , it is subject to structural remodeling where cells become dynamic entities .",
    "they proliferate and migrate , eventually forming new functional secretory units @xcite .",
    "dysregulation of these events is believed to contribute to cancerogenesis @xcite . in - vitro experiments",
    "preserve important aspects of this epithelial biology @xcite , and migration of single cells has been studied in cell culture systems on molecular and mechanical levels @xcite .",
    "single cells are by no means passive movers and governed by chance , but influence and control their movements themselves . for these movements to occur morphological changes are necessary which are realized in the formation of distinct subcellular domains . in fig . 1a",
    "a single cell is shown during movement .",
    "after the formation of a so - called lamellipodium , ( a v - shaped protrusion ) this part of the cell attaches to the cell culture surface .",
    "the cell body is then pulled towards the front part (  leading edge  ) via the activation of mechanical intracellular linkages .",
    "eventually the  trailing  edge , a thin , elongated structure at the opposite side of the cell with respect to the lamellipodium , detaches from the surface which allows a net translocation of the cell . in this ",
    "polarized  fashion the cell apparently crawls on the surface of the cell culture substrate , continuously readjusting its direction . during movement cells loose tiny parts of their cytoplasm , marking at least parts of their trajectories .",
    "it is known that cells change their movement patterns when the activity of proteins involved in cell adhesion is regulated up or down ward .",
    "when these proteins for example are suppressed , cells loose their ability to migrate in a polarized fashion @xcite . as several recent works on velocity distributions of cells show , it seems very likely that cell movement depends strongly on the surrounding of individual cells .",
    "experimental results range from normal diffusion @xcite to exponential velocity distributions @xcite .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to show that an anomalous diffusion approach , already discussed in @xcite , might be general enough to explain the different experimental results on a common theoretical ground .",
    "to describe the dynamics of a single cell which has the ability to detect the presence of trajectories of other cells , we propose the following model .",
    "imagine each cells paints its trail onto the surface .",
    "the paint slowly fades , and can not be seen after a certain time .",
    "another cell which detects the line of paint tries to follow it as good as possible . from time to time",
    "the cell will be distracted from strict path following by random (  thermal  ) events . at the same time this cell also marks its trajectory with paint .",
    "as many cells move across the same surface there will evolve a network of paths . since paint fades and new trajectories are added to the network",
    ", the network will undergo slow dynamical changes .",
    "any cell equipped with a trail following mode will try to restrict its movements onto the network of trails of former cells .",
    "the situation here is much alike diffusion in porous media where particle trajectories are restricted onto certain pathways , and can not propagate through full two- or three - dimensional space . in the case of cell migration an individual cell tries to follow the dynamical  web  of trajectories other cells have taken before .",
    "modeling cell migration as a stochastic diffusion process of this kind clearly involves non - linearities in the associated fokker - planck like equations @xmath0(x , t ) p(x , t)\\right ) + \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}\\left(d\\left[p\\right](x , t ) p(x , t ) \\right ) \\quad .",
    "\\label{fp}\\ ] ] to incorporate the idea that cells follow the gradient of metabolites emitted by other cells along their trajectories , a non - linear flow - term of the form @xmath1 = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x } p$ ] would be reasonable .",
    "however , we neglect the flow - term in the following , since a posteriori we find almost no experimental evidence for it . to incorporate the anomalous diffusion idea",
    ", we decide the functional dependence of the diffusion parameter to be @xmath2p = p^{\\nu}$ ] . with this choice equation ( [ fp ] ) can be solved by following the entropy approach by tsallis @xcite . here",
    "the the classical entropy definition @xmath3 is modified to @xmath4 by maximizing @xmath5 while keeping energy fixed it can be shown that the resulting @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath7 also solves eq .",
    "( [ fp ] ) without the flow - term @xcite . here",
    "@xmath8 is the generalized @xmath9 partition function .",
    "the relation of the tsallis entropy factor @xmath9 , and @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ fp ] ) is given by @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "note that this distribution is a power law , and only in the limit @xmath12 the classical gaussian @xmath13 is recovered .",
    "it is relatively straight forward to derive the corresponding velocity distributions of the associated particles @xmath14^{\\frac{1}{1-q } } \\label{sfp}\\ ] ] which has been derived for the first time in @xcite , and which reduces to the usual maxwell - boltzmann result @xmath15 in the limit @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath16 can be seen as an inverse mobility factor , meaning that large values of @xmath16 are associated with small average cell velocities .",
    "if cell migration is in fact describable as anomalous diffusion governed by a fokker - planck equation like eq .",
    "( [ fp ] ) with the special choice of @xmath17 $ ] , the cell velocity distribution function should follow the form of eq .",
    "( [ sfp ] ) .    to further characterize the nature of the diffusion process we will also look at normalized temporal autocorrelation functions @xmath18 , and at two - point correlation functions @xmath19 ^ 2 \\rangle_t$ ] , of an underlying process @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes the average over time @xmath22 . for ( fractional )",
    "brownian motion , the correlator scales as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is sometimes called the hurst exponent .",
    "for @xmath25 the classical diffusion result is obtained ( brownian motion ) , @xmath26 indicates correlated diffusion , which we expect in our case .",
    "to record the trajectory of an individual mouse mammary gland epithelial cell over long time periods of up to 72 hours , epithelial cells @xcite were seeded sparsely onto a 2d plastic culture dish .",
    "the dish was then placed into a mini - chamber mounted on an inverted phase contrast video - microscope .",
    "this provided incubator conditions and periodic image acquisition in 90 seconds intervals was performed @xcite .",
    "about 900 to 1000 ( video ) frames were taken per measurement . for our purposes",
    "we only take the first 25 hours of the recording since after that cell density becomes high , and motion of individual cells restricted , see video ( http://is2.kph.tuwien.ac.at/thurner/cellmove ) . as seen in the videos ,",
    "cells move within limited regions for many timesteps , crossing and following its own and other cell s trajectories .    from the video sequences the motion of individual cells",
    "was extracted semi - automatically by a commercial motion tracking routine @xcite .",
    "cell nuclei were tracked based on a convolution kernel of a 100 square pixel field ( about half the size of the cell nucleus at the given resolution ) .",
    "these extracted cell trajectories , see lines in fig .",
    "1b and c , were recorded as the @xmath27 and @xmath28 positions in two dimensions ( the subscript indicating discrete time ) .    due to the limited data length",
    "it is more useful to study velocity distributions rather than spatial distributions directly .",
    "we work in polar coordinates and transform the trajectories @xmath29 to a velocity ( length - increment @xmath30 ) process @xmath31 and a direction process @xmath32 @xmath33 $ ] .    as a control for the plausibility of our model we genetically modified cells from the same cell line in two virus experiments @xcite .",
    "the basic idea here is to alter the cell s motion program such that its interaction with other cells and hence its ability to follow other cell trajectories becomes effectively reduced . in the case of non - interacting cells",
    "one should expect the model loose its validity , i.e. that cell movement would approach classical diffusion , i.e. @xmath12 . in the first experiment , we infected cells with a virus carrying the coding sequence of enhanced green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) . since viral infection has been reported to significantly influence morphology and molecular homeostasis of mammary epithelial cells @xcite , we expected alterations on cellular migration patterns as well",
    ". this condition will be referred to as  infected  in the following . in a second experiment we inserted the coding sequence of gene tpa - inducible sequence 7 ( tis7 ) instead of gfp into the cells .",
    "tis7 , a co - repressor of gene transcription and functionally associated with loss of epithelial characteristics like cell - to - cell adhesion was chosen to additionally test for eventual alterations in cell mobility @xcite .",
    "this experimental condition will be called ",
    "tis7  in the remainder of the paper and contains consequences of the viral infection itself and the effects of over - expressed tis7 .",
    "for a first demonstration of correlated motion to be present , we compute @xmath34 for the individual @xmath27 and @xmath28 components of cell trajectories . we find a hurst exponent of about @xmath35 for all the experimental conditions ( normal , infected , and tis7 ) , indicating correlated motion , see tab . 1 .",
    "we find the direction process @xmath36 practically equally distributed over the interval @xmath37 $ ] . by looking at normalized autocorrelations @xmath38 of @xmath36 , significant ( 99% significance level ) coefficients",
    "are found which decay as a power law .",
    "the situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ ac]a for all three experimental conditions .",
    "power decay exponents were fit by a least square routine in the region indicated by the straight lines ; the corresponding values are collected in tab .",
    "1 . errors ( standard mean errors over 5 independently moving cells ) in the fit - regions are somewhat larger than symbol - size and were omitted for clarity of the plot .",
    "normal cells show lower correlations , which decay slightly faster than those of the manipulated cells .",
    "the normalized autocorrelations for the velocity process @xmath39 are given in fig .",
    "correlation coefficients are statistically significant and in the same order of magnitude as the direction series. again , the tails of the correlations follow a power law ; for the corresponding exponents , see tab . 1 . here",
    "normal cells have higher correlations than infected ones . infected and tis7 cells show a slower decay than normals .",
    "errors here are about twice symbol size .    in fig .",
    "[ vdist ] we show the velocity distribution ( histogram ) of the normal cells in a log - log plot .",
    "the solid line is a three parameter fit to eq .",
    "[ sfp ] ; fit - parameters for @xmath9 and @xmath16 for all conditions are listed in tab . 1 . at the low limit of @xmath40",
    "the distribution approaches a constant , while the right tail clearly decays in a power law fashion @xmath41 .",
    "we find infected and tis7 cells to move faster on average , as seen in the mobility factor or directly in @xmath42 , see tab . 1 .",
    "we provide clear evidence that cell migration of interacting cells is a correlated diffusion process .",
    "this finding is supported by several facts found in our experimental data .",
    "correlated motion is shown by the presence of a hurst exponent significantly larger than 0.5 and by non - vanishing autocorrelation functions in the velocity and direction processes .",
    "this finding is in nice agreement with a recent and similar experiment @xcite , where an @xmath24 of @xmath43 was found .",
    "the direction autocorrelation functions are found to decay in a power like manner , with exponents consistently smaller than 1 , opening the possibility for super - diffusion .",
    "this obviously excludes naive autoregressive or moving average models ( arma ) to be realistic candidates for interacting cell migration since these models have exponential decays of autocorrelation functions .",
    "this finding means that the direction of cells is a  long memory  process . for velocity autocorrelation functions",
    "the power decay is smaller but still present for the normal cells .",
    "the value of the correlation coefficient at @xmath44 is about the same size as for the @xmath36 process .",
    "the virus effect is seen in the following way .",
    "the most obvious difference of normal and manipulated cells is seen in their mobility , which is drastically enhanced for manipulated cells .",
    "this is expected because we believe that there is less effective adhesion proteins present in the infected and especially in the tis7 cells .",
    "very similar results have been reported in @xcite , however , with a different experimental strategy : there cells propagated in different aggregates of cell types with different adhesion properties to hydra cells .    infected and",
    "tis7 cells show larger correlations in the direction process , meaning that directions are changed less frequently than normal cells do .",
    "this is expected since these cells detect trails less well and lose their ability to follow other cells . once moving they keep their direction more strictly than normal cells . for the velocity process",
    "we observe the opposite effect : normal cells have larger autocorrelations , i.e. normal cells change their velocities less frequently than infected and tis7 ones .",
    "we attribute this effect to a more controlled movement of normal cells when following a path , or equally , a stronger influence of random effects on infected or tis7 cells with damaged movement control .",
    "we now turn to the main result of this paper .",
    "the velocity distribution follows the general form of the anomalous diffusion model .",
    "maybe most importantly this model allows to naturally understand the presence of the power tail to the right of the distribution .",
    "the power can be related ( via @xmath9 ) to the @xmath10 exponent in eq .",
    "( [ fp ] ) . for normal cells",
    "we find @xmath45 which goes down to @xmath46 for the infected , and to @xmath47 for the tis7 cells . in the tsallis thermodynamics framework",
    "this means , that infected cells approach the classical thermodynamic regime , while normal cells with their complex motion control system are governed by non - extensive statistics . in this framework",
    "it is clear that for non - interacting cells ordinary diffusion and gaussian or exponential velocity distributions were observed in @xcite , being extreme cases of the present model .",
    "if we accept that in our experiments infection diminishes the degree of interaction between cells and their trajectories , we see that the @xmath9 value should serve as a sensible quantifier of the degree of interaction . again , in @xcite very similar behavior of 2d moving patterns of hydra cells were found .",
    "they reported @xmath48 , or a power decay in the velocity distributions of about @xmath49 and suggest a different way of explaining the movement patterns based on granular flow models .",
    "furthermore , these and our findings clearly exclude a levy flight interpretation of cell movements , and led by the observation of trail - following tendencies of cells we believe that cell migration is governed by a realization of anomalous diffusion .    in conclusion , we think that the presented method provides a useful tool to qualitatively understand different movement patterns of realistic cell migration , and to quantify the degree of interaction by the value of the tsallis @xmath9 .",
    "since epithelial cell migration plays such an important role in situations like wound healing of skin epidermis or cancer metastasis we speculate that the above way of quantification could even be a practical pathological characterization of cells , regarding diverse biological dignities and pharmacological responses , in addition to molecular and mechanical parameters .",
    "finally , we note that the basic idea behind the presented model could also be applicable to other fields , like electrical flow through networks of biological neurons .",
    "there the effective network topology is also subject to constant changes due to synaptic plasticity ( hebb or other type of learning ) .",
    "electrical current will flow on excitable media restricted to a given network and by doing so , will re - shape it by changing synaptic weights . here",
    "we would predict power law distributions of electrical current changes , in analogy to the @xmath40 distributions presented here .",
