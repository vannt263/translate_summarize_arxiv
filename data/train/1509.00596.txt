    "the idea of studying noncommutative spaces goes back to the fathers of quantum mechanics .",
    "it was erwin schrdinger @xcite the first one who considered the possibility that geometry looses its meaning in quantum mechanics , but it was werner heisenberg @xcite who suggested the idea of coordinate uncertainty relations to solve the problem of short distance singularities in quantum field theory .",
    "the first one who formalized this some years later was hartland snyder @xcite .",
    "this idea has been widely studied in the last decades and there are several motivations for that .",
    "one of them is that there are strong reasons that suggest that at very small distances ( of the order of planck length ) , the concept of localization does nt make sense anymore , i.e. the concept of point is meaningless .",
    "some other motivations for studying noncommutative spaces have come up in other places like string theory @xcite and constructive field theories @xcite , among others .",
    "the simplest idea of a noncommutative space ( or space - time ) is to consider a noncommutative @xmath1 product @xcite ( usually called star product ) for which the commutator of the coordinate functions is a non - zero constant @xmath2_{\\star } = x^i\\star x^j - x^j\\star x^i= i \\theta^{ij}. \\label{introeq}\\ ] ] the most common star products in the literature are the grnewold - moyal @xcite and the wick - voros @xcite .",
    "as we will see later , the wick - voros product is associated to the normal ordering while the moyal product is associated to the symmetric ordering of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "these two are not the only star products that give rise to the commutator ( [ introeq ] ) .",
    "there is a generalization of these two products which is a one - parameter family of star products , called s - ordered products , which range from anti - normal to normal ordering , passing through the symmetric ordering .",
    "the s - ordered products havent been studied as much as the moyal and wick - voros products and this is the reason we will consider them in this work . more precisely , we will consider the @xmath3 field theory with s - ordered products and we will compute the two - point and four - point green s functions up to one loop in detail . for a general review of field theory on noncommutative spaces",
    "see @xcite .",
    "as we will see , the s - ordered products do not exhaust the star products that give rise to the commutator ( [ introeq ] ) .",
    "the whole family of star products is very wide , however , the relevant star products to be considered in the context of field theory are the translation invariant star products ( which include the s - ordered products ) .",
    "these products have been studied in @xcite , and it has been shown that the whole family of translation invariant star products can be characterized by a simple expression @xcite . in this work",
    "we realized that most of the computations that can be done for the s - ordered product can be easily generalized to the general translation invariant star products .    in chapter [ chap1 ]",
    ", we briefly introduce the well known moyal and wick - voros products in the context of weyl and weighted weyl maps , and we explain how can these two products be generalized to the s - ordered product . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider the products in a two dimensional space , whose generalization to higher dimensions is straightforward . in chapter [ chap - s - ord ] we look at classical and quantum field theory with s - ordered products .",
    "we consider a @xmath4-dimensional space - time where only the two spacial coordinates are non - commutative .",
    "we compute the vertex and the propagator of the @xmath3 theory and with this we find the two - point and four - point green s functions up to one loop order and show all the corresponding diagrams . in chapter [ chap - transinv ]",
    "we introduce the general translation invariant star products .",
    "we find that all the diagrams and their symmetry factors are the same as for the s - ordered products , and compute explicit expressions of the two - point and four - point green s functions .",
    "we also find that the ultraviolet / infrared mixing @xcite is present in any noncommutative translation invariant star product , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "finally , in chapter [ chaptransinv ] we will introduce the concept of twist .",
    "we show that any translation invariant star product can be written in terms of a twist and show that the star commutator is invariant under the twisted poincar transformations .",
    "in this chapter we will introduce the moyal and wick - voros products , as well as the more general s - ordered product on which we will focus in this and the next chapter .",
    "we will first introduce the integral form of the products , and then give the differential form , which is the one we will use for noncommutative field theory . for the moment only the two spacial coordinates are relevant because we consider that the time coordinate commutes with the two spacial coordinates .",
    "time wo nt be relevant until next chapter where we will do field theory",

    "the moyal product is among the family of products that satisfy this property , but before defining it , we need to introduce the weyl map which associates an operator to a function and is defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the symplectic fourier transform of @xmath16 . so the map can be explicitly written as @xmath17 the weyl map is invertible , and its inverse is given by the map @xmath18 which is called the wigner map . indeed , @xmath19 this allows to define the moyal product as",
    "@xmath20 in order to find an integral expression of the moyal product , note that applying equation ( [ 1 ] ) on the left hand side of the definition , we find @xmath21 while the right hand side is @xmath22 where we have used the property @xmath23 which is easily found using the baker - campbell - hausdorff formula .",
    "now , using the linear transformations @xmath24 the product @xmath25 takes the form @xmath26    comparing this with equation we can see that the integral form of the moyal product is @xmath27      there is a more general version of the weyl map , called the weighted weyl map , which is defined as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an invertible function , called the weighted function .",
    "this map is invertible , and its inverse is viven by @xmath30    in the previous section we saw how to define the moyal product from the weyl map .",
    "the wick - voros product is defined in the same way as the moyal one , but using the following weighted weyl map @xmath31 which can be written as    @xmath32    where    @xmath33",
    "so , the wick - voros product can be defined as @xmath34 from which the integral form can be shown to be @xmath35      the two operators @xmath5 and @xmath6 can always be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are two operators which satisfy the commutation relation @xmath39=\\theta$ ] and can be seen as the creation and annihilation operators . using the notation @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the weyl map and equations and can be written in terms of @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 as @xmath46    @xmath47    and @xmath48    if we write the operators in terms of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the weyl map @xmath49 gives operators in the symmetric ordering , which means that a monomial @xmath50 is transformed by @xmath49 into the operator @xmath51 for example the monomial @xmath52 is sent to @xmath53 . on the other hand ,",
    "the weighted weyl map @xmath54 corresponding to the wick - voros product , gives always operators in the normal ordering ( annihilators to the right and creators to the left ) .",
    "a third way of ordering the operators is the antinormal ordering ( creators to the right and annihilators to the left ) .",
    "these are particular cases of a more general ordering which is defined as @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "in particular , for @xmath58 , the monomial @xmath52 is sent to the antinormal , symmetric and normal ordered operators respectively @xmath59    there is a one parameter family of weighted weyl maps that give rise to s - ordered operators , and is given by @xmath60 with @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "note that this map reduces to the weyl map for @xmath61 , and to the weighted weyl map corresponding to the wick - voros product for @xmath62 .",
    "this map can be explicitly written as @xmath63 or equivalently @xmath64 where @xmath65 is another kind of symplectic fourier transform , like .",
    "this map is invertible , and its inverse is given by @xmath66 to prove this we need the following properties ( see appendix [ sec : appb ] ) @xmath67 and @xmath68 we can now check equation @xmath69 but using properties and this is @xmath70    given that the map @xmath71 is invertible , we can define the s - ordered star product as @xmath72 it has been shown @xcite that this product can be written as a series expansion as follows @xmath73 this is what we call the differential expression of the s - ordered product .",
    "it is important to mention that the range of the differential expression @xcite is smaller than the range of the integral expression . from now on we assume that the functions under consideration are in the range of the differential expression .",
    "in this chapter we study the noncommutative @xmath3 field theory obtained from the commutative one by replacing the ordinary product with the s - ordered star product .",
    "in particular we consider the following action @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the free klein - gordon action given by @xmath76 and @xmath77 is the interacting action given by @xmath78    now , as we said , we consider the noncommutative action by replacing the ordinary product by the star product .",
    "so the free action becomes @xmath79 while the interacting action becomes @xmath80 we will compute the two and four point green s functions of this theory , but before going to the quantum level , let us look at some properties of the theory at the classical level .      in this section",
    "we will describe some properties of the theory at the classical level that will be useful for the next section , where we will compute the propagator and the vertex of the theory at quantum level .",
    "we start by looking at the following property @xmath81 which is called the trace property .",
    "to check this we will use the differential form of the star product , which written in terms of @xmath82 and @xmath83 is @xmath84 so we can write the star product as @xmath85 }   e^{-i ( p+q)\\cdot x}.   \\label{9 }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] integrating over @xmath86 we get @xmath87 so the star product commutes inside the integral , which is what we wanted to prove .",
    "the other property we will need is the explicit expression of the star product inside the integral . for this",
    "we use again the differential form of the s - ordered product @xmath88 }   g(x)\\ ] ] @xmath89 \\right)^n}{n ! } g(x)\\ ] ] @xmath90 @xmath91",
    "so , doing integration by parts and neglecting the boundary terms we have @xmath92 but noting that @xmath93 we get @xmath94 finally , using @xmath95 , we get the following expression for the integral of the s - ordered star product @xmath96 we can use this results to find the equation of motion .",
    "first we need to make a small variation @xmath97 so that the variation of the action is @xmath98 where we used the trace property .",
    "integrating by parts and neglecting the boundary terms this is @xmath99 using equation we have @xmath100 but this must vanish for any variation of the field @xmath101 , so the equation of motion is @xmath102    note that the only case for which this equation is equal to the klein - gordon equation is for @xmath61 , however , both equations have the same solutions due to the invertibility of the operator @xmath103 .",
    "moreover , the on shell condition is the same , to see this let us take the fourier transform of equation @xmath104 where we use the notation @xmath105 for @xmath106 and @xmath107 for @xmath108 .",
    "from now on , the boldface characters will stand for vectors in the two - dimensional space , while normal characters will stand for vectors in the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional space - time .",
    "the on shell condition is then given by @xmath109 which is equivalent to the usual condition @xmath110 which means that , at the classical level , the noncommutative free field theory given by the action with the s - ordered star product , is the same as the commutative one .",
    "we want to compute the green s functions of the theory , but for that we need the propagator and the vertex which we proceed to compute in this section .",
    "to compute the propagator , which we call @xmath111 , we start from its definition @xmath112 writing it in terms of the fourier transform , the left hand side becomes @xmath113 while the right hand side is @xmath114 from which follows that @xmath115 so the propagator is @xmath116      in order to find the pour - point green s function at tree level , we need to compute the vertex in momentum space .",
    "for that we need to compute an explicit expression for the star product of exponentials . using equation",

    "note that the vertex is not invariant under an arbitrary permutation of the momenta , however , it is invariant under cyclic permutations of the form @xmath126 ( see appendix [ sec : app ] ) .",
    "it is important to compare with the moyal case .",
    "first note that defining @xmath127 the vertex can be written as @xmath128 }   \\label{33}\\ ] ] where we used the property @xmath129 .",
    "the moyal vertex is given by the same expression with @xmath61 @xmath130    using conservation of momentum @xmath131 it is easy to show that @xmath132 , which is invariant under any permutation .",
    "so the moyal part determines the symmetries of the vertex , the non - moyal part is invariant under any permutation .",
    "we have the vertex and the propagator , therefore we can compute the two - point and four - point green s functions . at zeroth order",
    "we have the same diagrams as in conventional quantum field theory ( qft ) except that the propagators are the ones we found in noncommutative quantum field theory ( ncqft ) . at first order things",
    "get a bit different because we already have a vertex ( which as we saw , is not invariant under a generic permutation ) , so we need to keep track of the order in which the lines enter the vertex .",
    "this is why we will have to consider some diagrams that are equivalent in ordinary qft , but are not equivalent in ncqft @xcite . in order to see this , and to compute the symmetry factors of the diagrams , we need to recall how green s functions in momentum space are computed from the generating function ( see @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath133 where @xmath134   v_{\\star_s}.\\ ] ] the computation of the green s functions is done in the same way as in qft , but as we said we have to keep track of the order of the lines in each vertex due to the factor @xmath135)$ ] which comes inside @xmath136 .",
    "here we are interested in the connected component of the green s function @xmath137 , which is the relevant part if we want to compute scattering amplitudes .      in order to see how all this works",
    ", we will do the computation of the two - point correlation function @xmath138 in detail . from equation",
    "we can see that @xmath139 ( where @xmath140 ) at leading order is @xmath141 where the second subindex refers to the order of expansion .",
    "so , as usual it is just the propagator , as we expected because there is no vertex . at one loop order , things get a bit more complicated than in the commutative case because of the vertex .",
    "in qft we would just have the diagram shown in figure [ fig1a ]    0.5     0.5     with a symmetry factor @xmath142 .",
    "the usual way to compute this symmetry factor is by thinking of the vertex as made by four points , and then count the number of ways to attach the four lines to the vertex , as it is shown in figure [ fig2a ]    0.3     0.3     0.3     . in ncqft",
    "we do the same but we just count the number of ways of attaching the lines in such a way that the vertex does nt change . due to the invariance under cyclic permutations , just the order of the lines is relevant , so we can think of the four points as being on a ring , like in figures [ fig2b ] and [ fig2c ] .",
    "saying that the vertex is invariant under cyclic permutations is like saying that rotating the ring does nt change anything .",
    "let us use this to compute @xmath138 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath143 it is easy to see that there are just two inequivalent vertices , shown in figures [ fig2b ] and [ fig2c ] , and their corresponding diagrams are shown in figures [ fig1a ] and [ fig1b ] respectively .",
    "the symmetry factor of [ fig2b ] is @xmath144 because there are four ways of attaching the first external line , two ways of attaching the second external line ( to the right or to the left of the first one ) and the internal loop joins the two remaining points . on the other hand , the symmetry factor of [ fig2c ] is @xmath145 because there are four ways for the first external line , the second one must be in the opposite point and the internal loop joins the two remaining points .",
    "of course the sum of the two symmetry factors is @xmath142 which is the symmetry factor in qft .",
    "the integral corresponding to a given diagram is found in the same way as in ordinary qft ( as can be seen from equation ) , i.e. the feynman rules are the same except that the symmetry factors are computed in the way we explained , and the vertex and propagator are given by equations and .",

    "we have as usual the diagram shown in figure [ fig3a ] ,    0.3     0.3     0.3     0.3     0.3     0.3     but in ncqft the six diagrams shown in figure [ fig3 ] are not equivalent , so we have to consider them separately .",
    "each of these diagrams has a symmetry factor of @xmath145 because there are four ways to attach the first external line to the vertex , and then the other three are completely determined .",

    "the ultraviolet / infrared mixing is a phenomenon that appears in ncqft but it is not present in ordinary quantum field theory . to understand it ,",
    "let us look at equations and .",
    "the integral in equation corresponds to diagram [ fig1a ] , and it diverges for big @xmath184 , like in qft , so it has ultraviolet divergence . on the other hand",
    ", the integral in equation corresponds to diagram [ fig1b ] , but note that the integrand has an oscillating factor that softens the ultraviolet divergence but at the same time it is responsible for an infrared divergence .",
    "the same phenomenon is observed for the diagrams of the four - point green s function .",
    "this is what is usually called ultraviolet / infrared mixing .",
    "note that it is the moyal part of the vertex what produces this mixing , that s why it is a common characteristic of the s - ordered product for any value of the parameter @xmath185 . in the next chapter",
    "we will see that this is actually common for all the translation invariant star products .",
    "in the first two chapters we studied the s - ordered star product which are a special case of the translation invariant star product . in this chapter we will introduce the general translation invariant star products and we will do some field theory with these products .      in this section",
    "all vectors are in the two dimensional space as in the first chapter , so we will omit the boldface notation , we will come back to space - time in the next section .",
    "consider the generalization of the s - ordered product given by @xmath186 where @xmath187 is a distribution .",
    "note that this includes the commutative products . indeed ,",
    "if we impose the condition @xmath188 we get the commutativity condition @xmath189 .",
    "in particular , the ordinary product is of this form with @xmath190 .",
    "now , we want a translation invariant product , so we have to impose the condition @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the translation by any vector @xmath193 .",
    "the left hand side is given by @xmath194 while the right hand side is @xmath195 so the product is translation invariant if these two expressions are equal for any vector @xmath196 , which means @xmath197 where @xmath198 is a generic ( possibly complex ) function .",
    "so the general translation invariant star product is given by @xmath199 in particular , it is not difficult to see that the ordinary product is given by @xmath200 and the s - ordered product is given by @xmath201 and clearly the moyal product ( @xmath61 ) is given by @xmath202 , so we will call this the moyal part of @xmath198 .",
    "there are three constraints that the function @xmath198 has to satisfy .",
    "the first one is the associativity condition @xmath203 a straightforward computation gives @xmath204 and on the other hand @xmath205 so the associativity condition says @xmath206    the second constraint is the condition that the constant function @xmath207 be the identity of the algebra of functions with product , i.e. @xmath208 and    @xmath209    which means @xmath210    finally , the third constraint is the condition that the algebra of functions with the star product be a @xmath211-algebra .",
    "that is , there must be a map which satisfies the following conditions : @xmath212 where @xmath213 , and the bar denotes complex conjugation . in this case the involution @xmath211 is given by complex conjugation and just the last condition imposes a constraint on @xmath198 .",
    "the left hand side of the equation is @xmath214 and the right hand side is @xmath215 so @xmath198 has to satisfy @xmath216 this is a reasonable condition if we want to represent the functions as operators once we study the field theory of noncommutative spaces corresponding to these star products .",
    "so we have the following constraints on @xmath198 @xmath217 it has been shown that the most general function that satisfies these conditions is of the form @xcite @xmath218 where @xmath219 with @xmath220 an arbitrary real constant , and @xmath221 with @xmath222 an arbitrary real and even function such that @xmath223 , and @xmath224 a real odd function without linear term , i.e. @xmath225 note that the @xmath226 function corresponding to the s - product is given by @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "let us look at the commutativity condition @xmath229 .",
    "the product is commutative if @xmath230 equals @xmath231 which means @xmath232 but note that , from [ 37 ] we have @xmath233 and @xmath234 therefore , just @xmath44 contributes to the non - commutativity of the product . but note also that @xmath235 , so it is just the moyal part of @xmath198 what contributes to the non - commutativity of the product .",
    "heuristically , any noncommutative tisp is the moyal product  plus \" some ( non - local ) commutative product , while any commutative tisp is of the form @xmath236 .",
    "this also implies that any noncommutative tisp satisfies the commutator @xmath237_{\\star } = i \\theta^{ij}$ ] .",
    "let us now discuss the noncommutative field theory with a general translation invariant star product .",
    "note that we are back to the @xmath4-dimensional space - time .",
    "we consider again the action @xmath238 to compute the equation of motion we first need the following property @xmath239 and then we proceed as in section [ classfieldt ] . using this property and equation ( which is also valid for the general translation invariant product ) , we have @xmath240 for any variation of the field @xmath101 .",
    "so the equation of motion is @xmath241 or equivalently @xmath242 which again reduces to the same ordinary equation of motion due to the invertibility of the exponential factor .",
    "so , as for the s - ordered product , we find that at the classical level , the noncommutative free field theory given by the action , is the same as the commutative one .",
    "we now proceed to the computation of the propagator and the vertex . te propagator",
    "can be easily found from equation to be @xmath243 the vertex can be computed using equations and @xmath244 which can be written as @xmath245 so the vertex is given by @xmath246 where @xmath247 is again the ordinary vertex given in equation . note that the vertex can be written , using equation , as @xmath248 @xmath249 but using conservation of momentum in the vertex @xmath250 and recalling that @xmath251 we have @xmath252 and @xmath253 , so the vertex can be written as @xmath254      it is important to note that the factor @xmath255 in the vertex is invariant under any permutation , so the symmetries of the vertices depend just on the moyal part @xmath256 .",
    "this means that if we want to do noncommutative quantum field theory with a translation invariant star product with non - zero moyal part , then we know that all the diagrams and symmetry factors at any order , are the same for any of these products .",
    "so the diagrams of the two - point and four - point green s functions are the ones we found in sections [ 2pointgf ] and [ 4pointgf ] .",
    "note that it is possible to do quantum field theory with a translation invariant product without moyal part .",
    "but we saw that just the moyal part contributes to the non - commutativity of the product .",
    "this means that a translation invariant product without moyal part would give rise to a commutative ( possibly non - local ) quantum field theory , in which case we would have the same diagrams as in conventional qft .",
    "but here we are interested in the noncommutative products , which give rise to the commutator .",
    "so we will only consider the star products with non - zero moyal part ( i.e noncommutative ) and we will call them nctisp .",
    "we now proceed to the computation of the two - point and four - point green s functions .",
    "let us begin by the two - point green s function @xmath257 . at leading order",
    "it is , as usual , given by the propagator @xmath258 at first order , there are two diagrams [ fig1a ] and [ fig1b ] .",
    "the moyal part is the same we found in sections [ 2pointgf ] and [ 4pointgf ] .",
    "the non - moyal part of the vertex is given by @xmath259 the integral corresponding to diagram [ fig1a ] is then given by @xmath260 and the one corresponding to diagram [ fig1b ] is @xmath261 the connected two - point green s function at one loop order is finally given by @xmath262 note that if we substitute the @xmath226 function corresponding to the s - ordered function ( @xmath227 and @xmath228 ) , we get back the expression .",
    "let us compute the four - point green s function .",
    "at first order , the non - moyal part of the vertex is given by @xmath263 , so we have @xmath264 where @xmath155 is the same we had in section [ 4pointgf ] , and @xmath265 is the complex conjugate of @xmath226 .",
    "so , now we move to second order .",
    "the non - moyal part of the diagrams of the form [ fig5 ] is @xmath266 @xmath267 and again , as with the s - ordered product , the last two factors of this expression cancel with the exponentials of the two propagators of the internal lines .",
    "so for diagrams of the form [ fig5 ] we have @xmath268 where @xmath172 is the same we had in section [ 4pointgf ] . in a similar way ,",
    "it is easy to see that for the diagrams of the form [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] we have    @xmath269    and @xmath270    so we can finally write the connected four - point green s function up to one loop order @xmath271 as we said in the last section of chapter [ chap - s - ord ] , the ultraviolet / infrared mixing is present in the green s functions of all the s - ordered products .",
    "we noted that this was due to the fact that it is the moyal part the responsible of the mixing . from the results of this chapter",
    "it is clear that the mixing is present for any translation invariant star product , and it is again the moyal part the only one that contributes to the mixing .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the moyal part is the only responsible of the noncommutativity of any translation invariant star product .",
    "in the last two chapters we considered the noncommutative @xmath4-dimensional space - time with two noncommutative spacial coordinates and one time coordinate which commutes with the two spacial coordinates .",
    "more precisely , considered the noncommutative space - time with the following commutation relations @xmath272_{\\star}=i",
    "\\theta^{\\mu \\nu } \\label{53}\\ ] ] with @xmath273 , and @xmath274 where the @xmath1 refers either to the s - ordered product ( studied in chapter [ chap - s - ord ] ) or more generally to any translation invariant star product ( studied in chapter [ chap - transinv ] ) .",
    "the @xmath275 is a parameter of the noncommutativity of space .",
    "the commutator is invariant under coordinate translations , but it is not invariant under lorentz transformations @xcite , which means that @xmath275 is not invariant under lorentz transformations .",
    "this is not good for a fundamental theory because the noncommutativity should be an intrinsic property of space and not a frame dependent property .",
    "we will see that this is not as bad as it may seem , because the poincar invariance of the @xmath275 parameter is satisfied at a deformed level , as we will explain in this chapter .      in this section",
    "we derive the differential form of a general translation invariant star product , which will be useful later . recall that a general translation invariant star product was given by @xmath276 or equivalently @xmath277 we assume that the @xmath198 function can be expanded as @xmath278 for @xmath279 , where we use the notation @xmath280 and the sum goes from zero to infinity . with this notation ,",
    "equation becomes @xmath281 but we can easily see that the @xmath282 and @xmath283 in the expansion of the @xmath198 function can be substituted by partial derivatives acting on the exponential . more precisely , the expression can be written as @xmath284 where @xmath285 acts on the exponential to the right and @xmath286 acts on the exponential to the left . performing the integrals ,",
    "we can write this as a series expansion @xmath287 which we write as @xmath288 is is important to note that the differential expression may be valid on a smaller range ( depending on the @xmath198 function ) than the integral expression , so from now on we assume that the functions are in the range of the differential expression of the star product .",
    "we start by recalling that the poincar algebra is characterized by the lorenz generators @xmath289 and the translations generators @xmath290 , whose representation on the algebra of functions on minkowski space - time are given by @xmath291 and satisfy the following commutation relations @xmath292&=",

    "the infinitesimal form of this condition is the leibniz rule @xmath335 we know that quantum field theory , besides being translation invariant , is also lorentz invariant .",
    "the generators of the poincar algebra are derivations of the pointwise product , that is @xmath336 however , for the star products only the first of these two equations is satisfied while the second one is not . in noncommutative quantum field theory",
    "the translation invariance is preserved but the lorentz invariance is broken @xcite .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that the noncommutative parameter @xmath337 is not invariant under lorentz transformations .",
    "as we said , this is not satisfying for a fundamental theory , but we will see that with the help of the twist there is a way to achieve the poincar invariance of the noncommutative parameter @xmath337 at a deformed level . to see this , first note that the leibniz rule , i.e. the action of the poincar generators @xmath295 on the ordinary product of functions , can be written in terms of the product and coproduct as follows @xmath338 so the action on the star product of functions is given by @xmath339 where we used the fact that the product between @xmath340 and @xmath341 is the ordinary product . comparing the last two equations we can easily see that it is possible to have a deformed version of the leibniz rule if we define the twisted coproduct as @xmath342 so the twisted action of the poincar generators on the star product of functions is given by @xmath343 the twisted universal enveloping algebra @xmath344 is then defined to be the algebra generated by @xmath290 and @xmath289 modulo the commutation relations with coproduct given by equation and counit and antipode as in the undeformed case .",

    "this is motivated by the fact that there are two point of views : on one hand , one can think that the physical quantities should just depend on the noncommutative structure of space ( i.e. the commutator @xmath12_{\\star } = i \\theta^{ij}$ ] ) not in the specific product used for the computations . on the other hand one may think that the space is the ordinary one , but the action is different and contains an infinite number of derivatives , in which case one would expect different physical results , as it has already been argued in @xcite .",
    "we can also mention another point of view : when one considers  noncommutative spaces \" , given that the notion of points is lost and strictly speaking one does not have a space anymore , the new playground ( or new  space \" ) is the noncommutative algebra defined by the star product , in which case the physical quantities may depend on the particular product .",
