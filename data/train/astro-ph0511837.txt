    "since its discovery in 1930 by tombaugh @xcite , there have been surprisingly few published searches for satellites of pluto .",
    "the first search was made at lowell observatory in february - march 1930 , immediately following pluto s discovery @xcite .",
    "it failed to discover charon or any other satellite .",
    "kuiper and humason , working independently , conducted satellite searches in january 1950 @xcite . using photographic plates from the two searches ,",
    "kuiper established magnitude limits of plutonian satellites of @xmath13 between 032  from pluto and @xmath14 for the region from 2  from pluto to the edge of the stability zone .",
    "curiously , despite the fact that the v magnitude of charon in 1950 was about 17.5 @xcite and that it was near its maximum northern elongation of 08 from pluto at the time of kuiper s observations @xcite , no satellites were detected , although the presence of unresolved charon in kuiper s data may have resulted in his anomolously large measurement of pluto s diameter @xcite .",
    "the first 50 years of pluto - charon observations are reviewd by @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite searched for satellites of pluto out to the edge of pluto s solar - tidal stability region using the michigan - dartmouth - mit observatory at kitt peak , arizona and the 2.1 m struve telescope at mcdonald observatory in texas . using a non - standard filter passband consisting of two separate transmission peaks at 5000  ( fwhm = 350 ) and",
    "6575  ( fwhm = 225 ) , they placed 90%-confidence limits on satellites brighter than @xmath15 from 610  from pluto and @xmath16 for angular separations greater than 10  from pluto .",
    "these 90%-confidence limiting magnitudes were improved by @xcite to @xmath17 between 12  from pluto and @xmath18 between 210  from pluto through analysis of archival images from the _ hubble space telescope_. no satellites ( other than charon ) were detected in either of these searches .",
    "@xcite have also reported results from a plutonian satellite search using the hale 5-m telescope in june of 1999 .",
    "they searched pluto s entire hill sphere and placed a 50%-confidence detection limit of @xmath19 on additional satellites appearing more than @xmath204  from pluto , the point at which scattered light significantly degrades the sensitivity of their search . for potential undiscovered satellites with a solar  color , this limit translates into @xmath21 .",
    "previous satellite searches have used both the hill radius , @xmath22 , and the stability radius , @xmath23 , to define the outer edge of the search region . both of these radii derive from analytic solutions to the restricted three - body problem ( i.e. , a massless particle moving in the gravitational influence of the sun with mass , @xmath24 , and a planet with mass , @xmath25 ) . for a satellite to be gravitationally bound to a planet , it must have sufficiently low energy , so that its zero - velocity surface is closed .",
    "the largest , closed zero - velocity surface is the hill sphere , whose radius is given by :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the semi - major axis of the planet s orbit and @xmath28 is the planet s orbital eccentricity @xcite .",
    "somewhat less well - known is the solar - tidal stability radius given by szebehely s stability criterion : @xmath23=1/3 @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "satellite orbits with semi - major axis , @xmath29 , less than @xmath23 will be stable over long timespans , whereas for orbits with @xmath30 , instability can develop .",
    "( at distances greater than @xmath22 , the satellite is no longer bound gravitationally to the planet . )",
    "analytical arguments by @xcite showed that satellites on initially - circular orbits will become unstable if @xmath31 for prograde orbits or @xmath32 for retrograde orbits .",
    "numerical simulations also show that the orbits of satellites with @xmath33 for prograde orbits or @xmath34 for retrograde orbits become unstable on timescales of @xmath35 years @xcite .",
    "thus , szebehely s radius , @xmath23 , provides a better approximation to the size of the satellite orbital stability zone than the hill radius , @xmath22 , and , following @xcite , we adopt @xmath23 when referring to the region of stable orbits in the discussion below . for pluto ,",
    "@xmath36 astronomical units ( au ) , @xmath37 , and the combined mass of the pluto - charon system , @xmath25 , is @xmath38 kg @xcite , yielding a stability radius of @xmath39  km .",
    "pluto s first discovered moon , charon @xcite , orbits with a semi - major axis , @xmath40 , of @xmath41 km @xcite , within the inner 1% of pluto s orbital stability region @xcite .",
    "dynamical interactions with charon cause satellite orbits between 0.47  @xmath40 and @xmath202.0  @xmath40 to become unstable @xcite .",
    "thus , satellites may be found orbiting pluto out to a distance of 0.47  @xmath40 and orbiting the pluto - charon barycenter between @xmath202.0  @xmath40 and the stability radius , @xmath23 , although satellites on orbits closer to pluto than charon would be difficult to explain unless they post - date charon s outward orbital migration .",
    "the relatively large size of this region , the relatively bright limits reached by previous searches ( except for @xcite , which was not published when we submitted our proposal ) , and the upcoming launch of the _ new horizons _",
    "pluto mission in january 2006 motivated our search for additional satellites of pluto .",
    "we conducted a search for additional satellites of pluto using the f606w filter ( `` broad v '' ) in the wide field channel ( wfc ) of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ (",
    "_ hst  _ ) during two separate visits on ut 2005 may 15 and ut 2005 may 18 ( guest observer program 10427 ) .",
    "observational details can be found in table  [ obs_table ] .",
    "the acs / wfc has a field of view of @xmath42 with a plate scale of 0049 pixel@xmath43 .",
    "this is well - matched to the angular size of pluto s stability region ( 185  in angular diameter , as seen from earth in may 2005 ) , allowing the entire stability region to be imaged in a single _",
    "hst  _ pointing .",
    "a total of five images were obtained per _",
    "hst  _ visit : one short ( 0.5 sec ) exposure with pluto and charon unsaturated and four long ( 475 sec ) exposures .",
    "pluto s apparent motion , seen from _ hst",
    "_ and averaged over the visibility period , is 42 h@xmath43 .",
    "this caused stars to appear as streaks @xmath2011 pixels long , while unresolved objects moving with pluto appeared as point sources in all four long images .",
    "a sample long exposure from this dataset can be seen in fig .",
    "[ wfc_image ] .    with the detection of two additional satellites of pluto in the acs / wfc observations @xcite",
    ", we obtained two additional _",
    "hst  _ visits to the pluto system on 2006 february 15 and 2006 march 2 from the director s discretionary time ( go / dd program 10774 ) .",
    "these observations were designed to confirm the existance of the two satellites @xcite and were obtained using the acs high resolution channel ( hrc ) .",
    "the observations in february 2006 consisted of four 475-second integrations taken with the f606w filter with additional 1-second integrations ( to allow for accurate image registration with pluto and charon unsaturated ) at each position in a four point dither pattern .",
    "the final drizzle - combined image from the february 15 , 2006 observations , with labels indicating the positions of s/2005  p  1 and s/2005  p  2 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ hrc_image ] .",
    "the observations in march 2006 were also designed to measure the   colors of the satellites , and therefore alternated between 145-second integrations using the f606w filter and 475-second integrations using the f435w ( johnson b ) filter .",
    "as such , the march 2 observations are less sensitive to faint satellites and were not used in the subsequent analysis .",
    "some observational details about the acs / hrc observations are also presented in table  [ obs_table ] .",
    "to estimate the sensitivity of our satellite search using the may 2005 acs / wfc data , we generated synthetic point - spread functions ( psfs ) at 400 locations in the plane of the sky using the tiny tim v6.3 software package @xcite , with the assumption that the sources have the same spectral distribution as the sun .",
    "these psfs were randomly - spaced in separation and position angle from pluto and were scaled to uniformly span the range in wfc stmag magnitudes of 25.529.5 . to ensure proper sub - pixel alignment of the synthetic psfs in the geometrically - distorted acs images ( i.e. flt images )",
    "the psfs were subsampled by a factor of five , resampled at the proper pixel locations , rebinned to normal size , and then convolved with the ccd charge diffusion kernel generated by the tiny tim program .",
    "independent poisson noise was applied to the synthetic psfs before they were added , at the appropriate locations , to each of the four deep ( 475-second ) exposures in the two acs / wfc visits .",
    "the four images were then `` drizzled '' together using the `` multidrizzle '' procedure supplied with the pyraf software package @xcite . in the drizzle procedure , the individual images are corrected for the geometric distortion of the acs instrument , rotated so that north is up and east to the left , sky background subtracted , co - registered relative to pluto , and combined using a median filter .",
    "in addition , pixels that have anomalously low sensitivity , that have high dark counts , or are saturated are excluded .",
    "the median combination removes artifacts , such as cosmic ray events or star trails , that do not appear in same position on the plane of the sky in at least two of the images .",
    "we then visually searched the final drizzle - combined image for objects ( real or synthetic ) with a psf - like appearance .    adding synthetic psfs to the data before conducting the actual satellite search results in a more accurate estimate of the limiting magnitude of the search ( since the conditions during the satellite search and the limiting magnitude estimation are identical ) .",
    "however , there is a small chance that one of the synthetic psfs will be coincident with a real source , thus preventing the detection of the real source .",
    "given the size of the acs / wfc images and the relatively compact nature of the acs / wfc psf ( @xmath44 of the total flux from a point source is contained within a circle of radius 3 pixels for the acs / wfc using the f606w filter @xcite ) , only 0.06% of the pixels in the acs / wfc images change by more than 0.1 times the standard deviation in the sky background when the synthetic psfs are added .",
    "thus , we feel the benefit of obtaining a more accurate estimate of the limiting magnitude vastly outweighs the small risk of masking a real object with a synthetic psf",
    ".    visual identification of point sources is generally more reliable than identification by automated detection algorithms .",
    "however , it can also be more subjective and prone to operator error / fatigue . to minimize the possibility that a _ bona fide _ satellite of pluto would be missed on account of operator error or some systematic error introduced via the drizzle analysis procedure ,",
    "the data were searched a second time using an independent technique : the four deep exposures were manually co - registered , displayed to the screen , and then cycled rapidly between images at roughly 15 frames per second . as a result",
    ", stars would appear as trails moving through the displayed region and cosmic ray events and bad pixels would appear and disappear .",
    "objects co - moving with pluto ( whether real satellites or synthetic psfs ) would appear in the same location in each of the four frames .",
    "although this technique proved to be somewhat less sensitive than the drizzle combination technique , it yielded consistent results .",
    "the field of view of the acs / hrc is @xmath45 , compared to @xmath46 with the acs / wfc . with the smaller field of view , there is an increased risk that a synthetic psf added to the data will be coincident with a real source in the data , thus preventing the detection of the real source . to avoid this possibility",
    ", data from the february 2006 acs / hrc observations were first searched for satellites using the drizzle technique without the addition of synthetic psfs .",
    "the data were then analyzed a second time , this time with synthetic psfs added to provide an estimate of the sensitivity .",
    "a total of 200 psfs , uniformly spaced between magnitudes 24.5 and 28.5 , were added at random locations in each of two annuli centered on pluto : one extending from 13  and the other from 35 . since placing so many synthetic psfs in such a small area would result in a high probability of overlapping psfs , the acs / hrc data was analyzed 10 separate times , with only 20 randomly - selected psfs in each annulus for each analysis run .",
    "after the synthetic psfs were added , the acs / hrc images were drizzle - combined and the resulting image was visually inspected for point sources in a manner similar to the acs / wfc images .",
    "finally , to estimate the limiting magnitude within 1  of pluto , we placed 12 synthetic psfs in a ring at an angular distance of 05 from pluto , using the techniques described above .",
    "the magnitude of the individual psfs in the ring pattern was then varied until at least one of the psfs could no longer be easily identified .",
    "although this technique is not as statistically rigorous , it provides a reasonable estimate of the limiting magnitude in this region .",
    "scattered light from pluto prevents us from assigning meaningful upper limits within @xmath2003 of pluto .",
    "as mentioned above , two satellites of pluto , provisionally designated s/2005  p  1 and s/2005  p  2 ( hereafter p1 and p2 ) , were discovered during the analysis of the may 2005 acs / wfc images @xcite . during the discovery epoch ,",
    "p1 had an apparent magnitude of @xmath47 and p2 had an apparent magnitude of @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "analysis of the discovery observations and archival _",
    "hst  _ observations yielded provisional orbits with semi - major axes of @xmath49  km for p1 and @xmath50  km for p2 @xcite .",
    "the orbits of p1 and p2 are circular ( or nearly so ) and co - planar with pluto s other large moon , charon , implying these moons share a giant impact origin @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the observation that p1 and p2 are essentially neutral in color with  values of @xmath51 for p 1 and @xmath52 for p2 @xcite .",
    "no other satellites were detected , out to the edge of pluto s stability region .",
    "the efficiency of detecting the synthetic point sources planted in the acs images is used to estimate the sensitivity of our search . the detection efficiency , as a function of psf magnitude ( in the f606w passband ) ,",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ detection_fig ] . defining the limiting magnitude to be the level at which the detection efficiency drops to 90% ,",
    "we find that the limiting magnitude , in the acs / wfc f606w passband and using the stmag magnitude system @xcite , of our search is @xmath53 .",
    "if we adopt a less stringent definition of limiting magnitude as the magnitude where the detection efficiency drops below 50% @xcite , then the limiting magnitude of our search is @xmath54 .",
    "both pluto and charon are severely over - exposed in the 475-second integrations .",
    "scattered light from these objects significantly degrades the sensitivity of the acs / wfc satellite search within 5  ( @xmath5  km ) of pluto . since the plate scale of the acs high resolution channel ( hrc ) is roughly twice that of the acs / wfc ( the acs / hrc platescale is @xmath200025/pixel versus @xmath200049/pixel for the acs / wfc ) , it is less severely affected by scattered light from pluto and charon , and so the february 2006 acs / hrc observations were used to search for potential satellites within 5  pluto . between 13  ( a projected distance of @xmath7@xmath4  km ) the 90%-confidence limiting magnitude is @xmath55 ( @xmath56 for 50%-confidence ) , while between 35  ( @xmath4@xmath5  km ) from pluto the 90%-confidence limiting magnitude is @xmath57 ( @xmath58 for 50%-confidence ) .",
    "between 031   ( @xmath10@xmath7  km ) from pluto the 90%-confidence limiting magnitude is @xmath59 .          where @xmath61 is the magnitude in the f606w passband using the stmag system and @xmath62 is the object s color in the johnson system .",
    "the coefficients @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 as well as the magnitude system zero point , @xmath66 are given by @xcite .",
    "objects in the outer solar system exhibit a wide range of  colors , e.g. @xmath67 for p1 and p2 @xcite and @xmath68 for 5145 pholus @xcite . since all three of pluto s known satellites",
    "exhibit roughly neutral colors ( charon has a  of 0.71 @xcite compared with the solar  color of 0.67 @xcite ) it is reasonable to assume that any as yet undetected satellites of pluto would have @xmath69 . substituting the appropriate values into eq .",
    "[ johnsonveqn ] , we find @xmath70 for the acs / wfc and @xmath71 for the acs / hrc . if , instead , the undetected satellites have extremely red  colors ( i.e. similar to 5145 pholus ) , then @xmath72 would be @xmath73 mag fainter .",
    "the limiting magnitudes of the satellite search , converted into johnson v magnitudes are given in table  [ sat_table ] .",
    "where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the distances from pluto to the sun and pluto to the earth , respectively , in units of au ; @xmath77 is the geometric visual albedo ; @xmath78 is the v magnitude of the sun at a distance of 1  au @xcite ; @xmath79 is the phase law ( in mag deg@xmath43 ) ; and @xmath80 is the phase angle of the object ( i.e. the sun - object - observer angle ) .",
    "we assume the phase law for potential satellites identical to that for charon , i.e. @xmath81 mag deg@xmath43 @xcite .",
    "thus , assuming a very dark albedo of @xmath11 , comparable with cometary nuclei @xcite , we can rule out , at the 90%-level of confidence , the existence of additional satellites in the pluto system larger than 49.4  km in diameter over the span of separations from pluto of 13 , 36.1  km over the span of 35 , and 28.6  km in diameter at separations of more than 5  from pluto .",
    "if , instead , we assume that potential satellites are as reflective as charon , i.e. having @xmath12 @xcite , then we can rule out satellites in these three regions larger than 16.0 , 11.7 , and 9.3  km in diameter , respectively . within 1of pluto ,",
    "the limiting diameters are 115  km for an albedo of @xmath11 and 37  km for an albedo of @xmath12 .",
    "our limiting diameters in this region are comparable to the limits obtained by @xcite using dynamical arguments and an assumed orbital eccentricity of charon of @xmath82 , which is reasonable given the uncertainty of 7x10@xmath83 in the recently published finding of zero eccentricity in the orbit of charon @xcite .",
    "these results are summarized in table  [ sat_table ] , and the limiting diameter for plutonian satellites for the four regions , as a function of satellite albedo , is shown in fig .",
    "[ radius_vs_albedo_fig ] .",
    "the above discussion has assumed a zero - amplitude light curve for potential satellites . while charon exhibits a relatively small light curve amplitude ( defined as the difference between maximum and minimum magnitude and not the absolute deviation from the mean ) of only 0.08 mag in v @xcite , other kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) exhibit much larger light curve effects @xcite .",
    "an extreme example is the kbo 2001  qg@xmath84 , which exhibits a light curve with an amplitude of 1.14 mag in r @xcite . if an object with a similarly extreme light curve exists within the pluto system and was at the minimum of its light curve during both of the acs / wfc ( if the object is located more than 5  from pluto ) or acs / hrc visits ( if the object is within 5  of pluto ) , it could have escaped detection , though its peak brightness would be nearly 3 times greater than the upper limits quoted above . in this pathological case , the length of the satellite in two dimensions could be as large as the limiting diameters quoted above , while the length in the third dimension could be up to a factor of 3 greater .",
    "the effective diameter of such a cigar - shaped satellite would be approximately 44% greater than the above size limits .    the 90%-confidence limit of @xmath6 at separations greater than 1  from pluto places an upper limit of roughly 49  km on the diameter of undetected satellites in this region .",
    "assuming bulk properties ( albedo , light curve , phase effect , density , etc ) similar to pluto s smallest known moon , p2 , potential undetected satellites in this region must be less than 40% the size of p2 with a mass of 2.5% that of p2",
    ". such a small satellite would be unable to strongly perturb the orbits of either p1 or p2 , and therefore the proposed circular , or near - circular , orbits of p1 and p2 @xcite do not necessarily preclude the existence of other very small satellites in the pluto system .",
    "finally , we note that both p1 and p2 appear to be in , or near , mean - motion resonance with charon , and therefore , we suggest that satellites below the detection limit of our search , may occupy the other mean - motion resonances .",
    "we suggest further observations with greater sensitivity to investigate this possibility .",
