    "the physics of hadronic @xmath0 decays has been an important testing ground for qcd since long .",
    "the precise data from the lep collaborations have allowed us to obtain invaluable information on fundamental and effective parameters of the theory . with the completion of the final analysis by the aleph collaboration @xcite it is timely to exploit these data also for a more precise extraction of qcd condensate parameters .    in a previous letter @xcite",
    "we had used earlier aleph data @xcite in a functional method to extract within rather general assumptions the qcd condensate of dimension @xmath3 related to the @xmath1 current . here",
    "we report the results of a reanalysis using the more precise final data from aleph .",
    "moreover , we found that the higher quality of the experimental data allows us also to obtain information on the condensates of higher dimension .",
    "in particular , we find that the data imply a strong correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xmath1 condensates .",
    "we extract the condensates from a comparison of the time - like experimental data with the asymptotic space - like results from theory .",
    "the assumptions of our approach are quite general .",
    "the essential property of the exact correlator in the space - like region on which our approach relies is that its fall - off with the 4-momentum squared @xmath5 is determined by at most two lowest - dimension terms in the operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "when we aim at a determination of the @xmath3 condensate , we assume a fall - off like @xmath6 within an error band that scales like @xmath7 . in the analysis where we want to determine the @xmath3 and @xmath4 condensates",
    ", we correspondingly assume a fall - off like a sum of @xmath6 and @xmath7 terms within an error band described by a @xmath8 term .",
    "these assumptions are more general than those of other approaches since they do not refer to the positive axis in the @xmath5-plane .",
    "furthermore our assumptions are quite independent of perturbation theory or indeed of qcd itself .",
    "similarly to the weinberg sum rules , they only depend on the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking . of course , as qcd is well established , we like to discuss our results in the language of qcd and the ope . for this reason",
    "we also include the @xmath9 correction to the @xmath10 term .",
    "if it was available , we could have included the perturbative correction to the @xmath7 term as well .",
    "however , as we will see , the inclusion of higher - order terms does not qualitatively affect our results .",
    "one should , however , keep in mind that it is not possible ( not even in principle ) to reconstruct the correlator in the space - like region from error afflicted time - like data , as this constitutes an analytic continuation from a finite domain .",
    "one has to stabilize this `` ill - posed problem '' by suitable additional assumptions .",
    "for example , the application of finite energy sum rules ( fesr ) for an extraction of qcd condensates could be justified if the result of qcd and the operator product expansion in the space - like region is simply a series in powers of @xmath11 times condensates ( vacuum expectation values of operators ) and if there are no truly non - perturbative terms . in this case",
    ", each moment would pick out a single operator .",
    "however , this is unfortunately not the case since logarithms arising within perturbation theory do not fall in this class of functions .",
    "the higher and lower dimensional condensates contribute to a given moment starting with the inclusion of corrections of order @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "it is also known that the perturbation series starts to diverge at some , not very high , order . as higher orders of the relevant wilson coefficients",
    "are not known , one can only hope that the extraction of the condensates is stable when correction terms are included .",
    "there is the additional problem of the contribution of the truly non - perturbative terms ( non - ope ) to the integral on the circle in the complex plane , even if this uncertainty , which is expected to be most prominent near the physical cut , can be reduced by choosing suitable linear combinations of moments .",
    "we should expect that there is a price to be paid for the generality of assumptions of our approach .",
    "however , even if it turns out that the errors in the values of the extracted parameters are relatively large , we can hope that our results lend additional confidence to the numerical results obtained with the help of fesr .",
    "we consider the polarization operator of hadronic vector and axial - vector charged currents , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 the conservation of the vector current implies @xmath16 .",
    "the connection to experimental observables is most easily expressed with the help of the spectral functions which are related to the absorptive part of the correlators . keeping the normalization as defined in most of the experimental publications , the functions @xmath17",
    "can be extracted from the decay spectrum of hadronic @xmath18-decays .",
    "we restrict the present study to the @xmath1 component which is related to the branching ratios of @xmath0 decays , @xmath19 through @xmath20 here , @xmath21",

    "the spin-0 axial vector contribution @xmath26 is dominated by the one - pion state , @xmath27 , with the @xmath28-decay constant @xmath29 gev @xcite .",
    "we use the final experimental data from the aleph collaboration @xcite because they have the smallest experimental errors .",

    "renormalon ambiguities are thus avoided .",
    "we will neglect in our analysis perturbative contributions proportional to the light quark masses .",
    "non - perturbative terms can be calculated for large @xmath33 by making use of the operator product expansion of qcd @xmath34 where @xmath35 are vacuum matrix elements of local operators of dimension @xmath36 . for the correlator with spin @xmath37 and in the chiral limit",

    "starting from the second order , coefficients in perturbation theory depend on the regularisation scheme implying that the values of the condensates are scheme - dependent quantities .",
    "the nlo corrections for @xmath40 were computed first in @xcite and the coefficient @xmath47 was found equal to @xmath48 .",

    "@xcite which allows , in principle , to extract the condensates from a comparison of the data with the asymptotic space - like qcd results under rather general assumptions .",

[ specfun - a0 ] ) , so that @xmath71 can be taken directly from the aleph data .",

    "the experimental precision of the data is described by a covariance matrix @xmath77 .    on the other hand",

    "this model amplitude is a continuous function of real type , but does not necessarily conform to the analyticity property i ) .",
    "since perturbative qcd is expected to be reliable for large energies , we expect that there is also useful information about the imaginary part of the amplitude provided that @xmath79 is large , i.e.  we can also use qcd predictions for @xmath80 . to implement this idea ,",
    "we rewrite the dispersion relation ( [ disprel ] ) in the following way : @xmath81 then we can calculate the left - hand side of this equation in qcd , @xmath82 whereas the right - hand side can be determined from experimental data .",
    "thus we shall test the hypothesis whether the left - hand side of ( [ disprel1 ] ) can be described by qcd while the right - hand side describes the experimental data .    in order to do that , we need an _ a - priori _ estimate of the accuracy of the qcd predictions .",
    "this can be described by a continuous , strictly positive function @xmath83 for @xmath84 which should encode errors due to the truncation of the perturbative series and the operator product expansion .",

    "if the perturbative part dominates , as is the case for the individual vector or axial vector correlators , the last known term of the perturbation series could be used as a sensible estimate of the error corridor , possibly combined with the first omitted term in the series over condensates . in the present work ,",
    "we focus on obtaining information on the correlation of the condensates @xmath91 and @xmath92 ; therefore we will use in a similar way an estimate of @xmath93 to define an error corridor which , in this case , scales with @xmath8 .",
