    "when illuminated with the probe light , each atom can be considered as an independent scatterer , and the intensity at the detector can be obtained by summing the field contributions from the individual atoms and squaring the total field .",
    "we assume that the spatial wavefunction of all atoms is the harmonic oscillator ground state in a lattice site of depth @xmath47 , and that it does not change during the measurement . the resulting intensity at the detector is given by @xmath157 where @xmath158 , and @xmath159 .",

    "2 was taken at @xmath172 with @xmath173 atoms .",
    "this value of @xmath20 is above the optimal value , so the ratio of @xmath174 in fig .",
    "2 gives @xmath175 , which is less than the expected optimal value of @xmath88 from fig .",
    "as mentioned above , we assume that the spatial wavefunction of the atoms remains unchanged for the duration of the exposure .",
    "for this assumption to be valid , the lamb - dicke parameter @xmath176 needs to be @xmath177 . in the 20@xmath75 lattice , @xmath178 , meaning that approximately one out of every 4 photons scattered will excite an atom to the second band of the lattice .",
    "an atom in the second band has larger position uncertainty and hence a smaller debye - waller factor , which reduces its contribution to the bragg scattering signal .",
    "the total number of photons scattered per atom is given by @xmath179 , where the duration of the probe is @xmath180s .",
    "for @xmath181 and @xmath182 , @xmath183 , thus justifying the assumption that the atoms remain in the lowest band during the pulse .",
    "for the bragg scattering measurements performed after time - of - flight , the momentum transferred from the probe to the atoms plays a more significant role , since the atoms are not trapped and will recoil after every photon scatter . despite this , we still see a good agreement between the observed decay of the bragg scattering signal and the decay expected for a heisenberg limited wavepacket , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "we have also performed non - spin - sensitive bragg scattering measurements from the 010 planes of the lattice and observe the same agreement , justifying that momentum transfer from the probe to the atoms can be neglected for the exposure times used .",
    "a low optical density of the sample is important so that the probe is unattenuated through the atom cloud , and multiple scattering events of the bragg scattered photons are limited  @xcite .",
    "the optical density can be approximated as @xmath184 where @xmath185 . with @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath186 atoms we have @xmath187 . at this value",
    "we do not expect significant corrections to the spin structure factor measurement due to the attenuation of the probe .",
    "we have not included any corrections in our measurement due to finite optical density effects .",
    "we collect bragg scattered light in the @xmath44 direction over a full angular width of 110  mrad , given by a 2.5 cm diameter collection lens located 23 cm away from the atoms . in the @xmath188 direction , light is collected by a 2.5 cm diameter lens placed 8 cm away from the atoms , corresponding to a full angular width of 318  mrad .",
    "the scattered light in each of the directions is focused to a few pixels on the cameras , so no additional angular information is obtained . for @xmath186 , @xmath181 , @xmath189 and a @xmath55 pulse ,",
    "the detector in the @xmath44 direction collects approximately 1300 photons , whereas the detector in the @xmath188 direction collects approximately @xmath190 photons .",
    "the noise floor from readout , dark current and background light per shot has a variance equivalent to approximately 250 photons in the @xmath44 direction and 1000 photons in the @xmath188 direction .",
    "the signals we detect are small enough that an uncorrelated sample may , in a single shot , produce a scattering signal as large as the ones produced by samples with afm correlations . to obtain a reliable measurement of @xmath88 we average at least 40 _ in - situ _ shots to obtain @xmath53 and at least 40 time - of - flight shots to obtain @xmath54 .",
    "we estimate the expected variance on @xmath88 by considering a randomly ordered sample in which @xmath191 is equal to + 1 or -1 with equal probability .",
    "@xmath88 can be written as @xmath192 which is equivalent to the square of the distance travelled on an unbiased random walk with step size @xmath193 .",
    "the mean and standard deviation can then be readily calculated : @xmath194 and @xmath195 , where @xmath196 denotes the variance of the random variable @xmath88 . with a standard deviation that is larger than the mean value",
    ", a considerable number of shots needs to be taken in order to obtain an acceptable error in the mean .",
    "the standard error of the mean for 40 shots will be @xmath197 , consistent with what we obtain in the experiment ( see fig .",

    "the local value of @xmath77 is always less than 4 in our calculations , so dqmc results in a lattice are sufficient for the comparison with theory .    in nlces , an extensive property of the lattice model per site in the thermodynamic limit is expressed in terms of contributions from finite clusters that can be embedded in the lattice .",
    "nlces use the same basis as high - temperature expansions , however , properties of clusters are calculated via exact diagonalisation , as opposed to a perturbative expansion in powers of the inverse temperature  @xcite .",
    "the site - based nlce for the hubbard model  @xcite is implemented here for a three - dimensional lattice and carried out to the eighth order for all thermodynamic quantities , except for @xmath91 , where due to the reduced symmetry , only seven orders were obtained . within its region of convergence ( @xmath202 for any @xmath3 and @xmath6 ) , nlce results do not contain any systematic or statistical errors .",
