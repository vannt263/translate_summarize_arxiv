    "intense theoretical investigations have been motivated to clarify the quantum numbers and to understand the under - structures of the pentaquark state @xmath8 since its observation @xcite .",
    "the extremely narrow width below @xmath9 puts forward a serious challenge to all theoretical models , in the conventional uncorrelated quark models the expected width is supposed to be of the order of several hundred @xmath10 , since the strong decay @xmath11 is okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) super - allowed .",
    "the zero of the third component of isospin @xmath12 and the absence of isospin partners suggest that the baryon @xmath8 is an isosinglet , while the spin and parity have not been experimentally determined yet and no consensus has ever been reached on the theoretical side . determining the parity of the pentaquark state @xmath8 is of great importance in establishing its basic quantum numbers and in understanding the low energy qcd especially when multiquarks are involved .",
    "the experiments of photo- or electro - production and proton - proton collision can be used to determine the fundamental quantum numbers of the pentaquark state @xmath8 , such as spin and parity @xcite .",
    "the magnetic moment of the @xmath8 @xmath13 is an important ingredient in studying the cross sections of the photo - production , and may be extracted from the experiments eventually in the future .",
    "in fact , the magnetic moments of the pentaquark states are fundamental parameters as their masses , which have copious information about the underlying quark structures , can be used to distinguish the preferred quark configurations from various theoretical models and deepen our understanding of the underlying dynamics .",
    "there have been several works on the magnetic moment @xmath13 @xcite , in this article , we take the point of view that the quantum numbers of the pentaquark state @xmath14 are @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and study its magnetic moment @xmath13 with the qcd sum rules approach @xcite .",
    "the article is arranged as follows : we derive the qcd sum rules in the external electromagnetic field for the magnetic moment @xmath13 in section ii ; in section iii , numerical results ; section iv is reserved for conclusion .",
    "in the following , we write down the two - point correlation function @xmath18 in the presence of a weak external electromagnetic field @xmath19 @xcite , @xmath20 where the @xmath21 is the correlation function without the external field @xmath19 and the @xmath22 is the linear response term . in this article , we take the ( scalar)diquark-(pseudoscalar)diquark - antiquark type interpolating current @xmath23 for the pentaquark state @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath24 here the @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 @xmath28 are color indexes .",
    "there have been several works on the magnetic moment of the @xmath8 using the diquark - triquark type current @xmath29 and diquark - diquark - antiquark type current @xmath30 within the framework of the qcd sum rules approach @xcite , @xmath31 \\left[u_c^t(x ) c \\gamma_5 d_e(x)\\right]c\\bar{s}^t_e(x ) - ( u\\leftrightarrow d)\\right\\ } , \\nonumber\\\\ \\eta_2(x)&=&{1\\over\\sqrt{2}}\\epsilon^{abc}\\left\\{\\left[u_a^t(x ) c d_b(x)\\right ] \\left[u_c^t(x ) c   d_e(x ) \\right ] c\\bar{s}^t_e(x ) - ( u\\leftrightarrow d)\\right\\ } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there exist a great number of possible quark configurations satisfy the fermi statistics and the color singlet condition for the under - structures of the pentaquark state @xmath8 , if we release stringent dynamical constraints .",
    "different quark configurations can be implemented by different interpolating currents , which are always lead to substantially different magnetic moments .",
    "although the three interpolating baryon currents @xmath32 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 can all give satisfactory masses about @xmath33 for the @xmath8 , the resulting magnetic moments are substantially different .",
    "without additionally powerful constraints ( such as the magnetic moment ) , we can not select the preferred quark configurations from various theoretical quark models .    the fierz re - ordering of the interpolating current @xmath23 can lead to the following sub - structures , @xmath34 a naive result of the fierz re - ordering may be the appearance of the reducible contributions with the sub - structure of @xmath35 ( i.e. @xmath36 ) clusters in the two - point correlation function @xmath21 @xcite , however , in our calculations with the interpolating current @xmath23 in eq.(2 ) , no such factorable @xmath35 terms appear , so there are no reducible @xmath36 contributions to the correlation function @xmath21 .",
    "the re - ordering in dirac spin space is always accompanied with color re - arrangement , which involves the underlying dynamics .",
    "the appearance of the @xmath36 component in the fierz re - ordering maybe manifest the possibility ( not the probability ) of the evolution from the @xmath8 to the @xmath37 final state without net quark - antiquark pairs creation ( maybe the quark - antiquark pairs created and annihilated subsequently ) , which is significantly in contrast to the conventional baryons , however , we have no knowledge about the detailed process of the evolution .",
    "if there are really some @xmath36 components in the interpolating current @xmath23 , they should be factorized out , the remainder can not have the correct quantum numbers to interpolate the @xmath8 . for detailed discussions about this subject",
    ", one can see ref.@xcite .",
    "the interpolating current @xmath23 in eq.(2 ) can couple to the pentaquark states with both negative and positive parity , and picks out only the state with the lowest mass without knowledge about its parity , for example , we use the ioffe current @xmath38 to interpolate the proton and pick out only the lowest energy state @xcite , which happen to have positive parity , while the possible negative parity states are included in the high resonances and continuum states .",
    "it is not necessary to include both the negative and positive states in the phenomenological spectral density .",
    "as the electromagnetic vertex of the pentaquark states with either negative or positive parity is the same , we can extract the absolute value of the magnetic moment of the lowest pentaquark state .",
    "the linear response term @xmath39 in the weak external electromagnetic field @xmath19 has three different dirac tensor structures , @xmath40 the first structure has an odd number of @xmath41-matrix and conserves chirality , the second and third have even number of @xmath41-matrixes and violate chirality . in the original qcd sum rules analysis of the nucleon magnetic moments",
    "@xcite , the interval of dimensions ( of the condensates ) for the odd structure is larger than the interval of dimensions for the even structures , one may expect a better accuracy of the results obtained from the sum rules at the odd structure . in this article , the spin of the pentaquark state @xmath8 is supposed to be @xmath42 , just like the nucleon , we can choose the first dirac tensor structure @xmath43 .",
    "the phenomenological spectral density can be written as @xmath44 where the first term corresponds to the magnetic moment @xmath13 , and is of double - pole .",
    "the second term comes from the electromagnetic transitions between the pentaquark state @xmath8 and the excited states , and is of single - pole . here",
    "we introduce the quantity @xmath45 to parameterize the electromagnetic transitions between the ground pentaquark state and the high resonances , it may have complex dependence on the energy @xmath1 and high resonance masses .",
    "however , we have no knowledge about the high resonances , even the existence of the ground pentaquark state @xmath8 is not firmly established , which is in contrast to the conventional baryons , in those channels we can use the experimental data as guides in constructing the phenomenological spectral densities . in practical manipulations , we can take the @xmath45 as an unknown constant , and fitted to reproduce reliable values for the form factors @xmath46 .",
    "the higher resonances and continuum states in eq.(7 ) are neglected for simplicity . from the electromagnetic form factors @xmath47 and @xmath48 , we can obtain the magnetic moment @xmath13 , @xmath49 after performing the operator product expansion in the deep euclidean space - time region , we can express the correlation functions at the level of quark - gluon degrees of freedom into the following form through dispersion relation , @xmath50}{s+p^2}+\\cdots\\ , ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51}{\\pi}&= & \\frac{s^4}{2^{12}5!4!\\pi^8}-\\frac { m_s\\chi \\langle\\bar{s}s \\rangle s^3}{2^{7}5!4!\\pi^6 } + \\frac{s^2}{2^{13 } 4!\\pi^6 } \\langle \\frac{\\alpha_s gg}{\\pi}\\rangle .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the presence of the external electromagnetic field @xmath52 induces three new vacuum condensates i.e. the vacuum susceptibilities @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the qcd vacuum @xcite .",
    "the values with different theoretical approaches are different from each other , for a short review , one can see ref.@xcite .",
    "here we shall adopt the values @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 @xcite . from eqs.(9 - 10 ) , we can see that due to the special structure of the diquark - diquark - antiquark type interpolating current @xmath23 ( also the @xmath30 @xcite ) , the @xmath59 and @xmath60 quarks which constitute the diquarks have no contributions to the magnetic moment though they have electromagnetic interactions with the external field , the net contributions to the magnetic moment come from the @xmath1 quark only , which is different significantly from the results obtained in refs.@xcite with the diquark - triquark type interpolating current @xmath29 .",
    "although the diquark - diquark - antiquark type and diquark - triquark type configurations implemented by the interpolating currents @xmath23 ( or @xmath29 ) and @xmath30 respectively can give satisfactory masses for the pentaquark state @xmath8 , the resulting magnetic moments are substantially different , once the magnetic moment can be extracted from the electro- or photo - production experiments , we can select the preferred configuration .",
    "finally we obtain the sum rules for the form factors @xmath47 and @xmath61 , @xmath62}{\\pi}e^{-\\frac{s}{m^2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the definition @xmath63 has been used , the @xmath64 is the strange quark mass and @xmath65 is the threshold parameter used to subtract the contributions from the higher resonances and continuum states .",
    "the borel transform can not eliminate the contaminations from the single - pole terms , we introduce the parameter @xmath66 which proportional to the @xmath45 in eq.(7 ) to the subtract the contaminations .",
    "we have no knowledge about the electromagnetic transitions between the pentaquark state @xmath8 and the excited states ( or high resonances ) , the @xmath66 can be taken as a free parameter , we choose the suitable values for @xmath66 to eliminate the contaminations from the single - pole terms to obtain the reliable sum rules .",
    "the contributions from the single - pole terms may as large as or larger than the double - pole term , in practical calculations , the @xmath66 can be fitted to give stable sum rules with respect to variations of the borel parameter @xmath67 in a suitable interval .",
    "taking the @xmath66 as an unknown constant has smeared the complex energy @xmath1 and high resonances masses dependence , which will certainly impair the prediction power . as there really exists a platform with the variations of the borel parameter @xmath67",
    ", the predictions still make sense .",
    "furthermore , from the correlation function @xmath21 in eq.(1 ) , we can obtain the sum rules for the coupling constant @xmath68 @xcite , @xmath69 where @xmath70",
    "the input parameters are taken as @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 . here",
    "we use the standard values @xcite , small variations of those condensates will not lead to large changes about the numerical values .",
    "the threshold parameter @xmath79 is chosen to vary between @xmath80 to avoid possible contaminations from higher resonances and continuum states . in the region",
    "@xmath81 , the sum rules for @xmath46 are almost independent of the borel parameter @xmath67 , which are shown in fig.1 for @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 .     with the borel parameter @xmath67 .",
    "]    for @xmath87 , we obtain the values @xmath88 where the @xmath89 is the nucleon magneton .",
    "although the numerical values for the magnetic moment @xmath90 vary with theoretical approaches ( i.e. @xmath91 or @xmath92 ) , they are small in general ; our numerical results are consistent with most of the existing values of theoretical estimations @xcite . for a short review of the existing calculations of the magnetic moments of the @xmath8 , one can consult ref.@xcite .",
    "the main contributions to the magnetic moments @xmath13 come from the perturbative term in eq.(10 ) , about @xmath93 , the contributions from terms of the quark condensates and gluons condensates have opposite sign , and the resulting net contributions are about @xmath94 , the high dimensional condensates are neglected as they are suppressed by large denominators . for the conventional ground state mesons and baryons , due to the resonance dominates over the qcd continuum contributions , the good convergence of the operator product expansion , and the useful experimental guidance on the threshold parameter @xmath65 , we can obtain the fiducial borel mass region",
    ". however , in the qcd sum rules for the pentaquark states , the spectral density @xmath95 with @xmath96 larger than the corresponding ones in the sum rules for the conventional baryons , larger @xmath96 means stronger dependence on the continuum or the threshold parameter @xmath65 @xcite . in eq.(12 ) , due to the large continuum contributions , the threshold parameter @xmath65 has to be fixed ad hoc or intuitively . in this article ,",
    "the threshold parameter @xmath65 are taken to be @xmath97 , the mass @xmath98 and the width @xmath99 , the contributions from the lowest pentaquark state can be successfully included in .",
    "although the uncertainties of the condensates , the neglect of the higher dimension condensates , the lack of perturbative qcd corrections , etc , will result in errors , we have stable sum rules , which are shown in fig.1 , the predictions still make sense , or qualitative at least .    in ref.@xcite",
    ", the authors take the diquark - diquark - antiquark current @xmath30 which is linear superposition of both s - type and p - type baryon currents ( @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) to calculate the magnetic moment @xmath13 in two approaches ( i.e. the qcd sum rules in the external field and the light - cone qcd sum rules ) , and obtain @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively . as",
    "the values obtained from the qcd sum rules in the external field are more stable than the corresponding ones from the light - cone qcd sum rules , @xmath104 is more reliable . for the diquark - diquark - antiquark type interpolating currents @xmath23 and @xmath30 , only the electromagnetic interactions of the @xmath1 quark with the external field have contributions to magnetic moment with the tensor structure @xmath105 , the resulting magnetic moments are substantially different . for the diquark - triquark type interpolating currents @xmath29",
    ", the electromagnetic interactions of all the @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath1 quarks with the external field have contributions to the magnetic moment , and @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "the interpolating currents @xmath23 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 with different quark configurations can all give satisfactory masses for the @xmath8 , without additional powerful dynamical constraints , we can not pick out the preferred configurations from various theoretical models ( constituent quark models or cluster quark models ) .",
    "the magnetic moment plays an important role in understanding the under - structures of the pentaquark state .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the magnetic moment of the pentaquark @xmath8 as ( scalar)diquark-(pseudoscalar)diquark - antiquark state with the qcd sum rules approach in the weak external electromagnetic field .",
    "the numerical results are consistent with most of the existing values of theoretical estimations , @xmath107 .",
    "the magnetic moments of the baryons are fundamental parameters as their masses , which have copious information about the underlying quark structures , different substructures can lead to very different results .",
    "the small magnetic moment @xmath13 may be extracted from the electro- or photo - production experiments eventually in the future , which may be used to distinguish the preferred quark configurations and qcd sum rules from various theoretical models , obtain more insight into the relevant degrees of freedom and deepen our understanding about the underlying dynamics that determines the properties of the exotic pentaquark states .",
