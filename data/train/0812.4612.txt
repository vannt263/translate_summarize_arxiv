    "entanglement is a uniquely quantum mechanical phenomenon in which quantum systems exhibit correlations not possible for classical systems . as such",
    ", entanglement is a vital resource for many aspect of quantum information processing including quantum computation , quantum metrology , and quantum communication @xcite . but despite its fundamental and practical importance and much work in the subject , there are many aspects of entanglement , especially multi - partite entanglement , that are in need of further study @xcite .",
    "a major challenge facing experimental implementations of quantum computation , sensing , and communication is decoherence , unwanted interactions between the system and environment .",
    "decoherence may be especially detrimental to highly non - classical , and hence most potentially useful , entangled states @xcite .",
    "a manifestation of this is entanglement suddent death ( esd ) in which entanglement is completely lost in a finite time @xcite despite the fact that the coherence loss of the system is asymptotic .",
    "this aspect of entanglement has been well explored in the case of bi - partite systems and there are a number of studies looking at esd in multi - partite systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , there have been several initial experimental studies of this phenomenon @xcite .",
    "however , even when analyzing a multi - partite system , previous works demonstrate esd only for bi - partite entanglement , either via concurrence or negativity rather than using measures for purely multi - partite entanglement .",
    "it is important to note that the characterization and quantification of true multi - partite entanglement is still very much an unsettled area for pure states and even more so for mixed states .    in this paper",
    "i explore the loss of detectable entanglement in a three qubit system by invoking entanglement witnesses , observables that can detect the presence of entanglement .",
    "entanglement may be present in a system but still not be practically useful @xcite . for entanglement to be useful",
    "its presence should be efficiently detectable experimentally .",
    "multi - partite entanglement can be detected inefficiently via quantum state tomography or a violation of bell inequalities .",
    "it can be detected efficiently by utilizing properly constructed entanglement witnesses @xcite .",
    "i compare the entanglement detection abilites of tri - partite entanglement witnesses to esd of tri- and bi - partite entanglement in a given system . in this exploration",
    "i find a state which has no concurrence and no tri - partite entanglement as measured by the tri - partite negativity but is entangled as measured by the negativity .",
    "i then apply these results to a three qubit quantum error correction ( qec ) code and explore how esd affects the working of this code .",
    "three qubit pure states can assume a ` standard ' form with respect to local unitary operations @xcite , @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "these states can be separated into four broad categories : separable ( in all three qubits ) , biseparable , and there exist two types of locally inequivalent tri - partite entanglement ( ghz and w - type ) @xcite .",
    "similar classification schemes exist for mixed states .",
    "reference @xcite defines four classes of three qubit mixed states each of which includes the preceeding classes as special cases .",
    "they are separable ( s ) states , bi - separable ( b ) states , w states , and ghz states , which encompasses the complete set of three qubit states .",
    "note that additional subtlety exists in characterizing the entanglement within each of these classes @xcite .    to determine in which class a given state belongs one can use entanglement witnesses , observables which give a positive or zero expectation value for all states of a given class and negative expectation values for at least one state in a higher ( i.e. more inclusive ) class .",
    "specifically , i will make use of entanglement wintesses @xcite to identify whether a state is in the ghz@xmath4w class ( i.  e.   a state in the ghz class but not in the w class ) , in which case it certainly has ghz type tri - partite entanglement , the w@xmath4b class , in which case the state certainly has true tri - partite entanglement either of the ghz - type or w - type , or the b class in which case it is not certain that the state has any tri - partite entanglement . while the witnesses we explore may not be of the sort that can be implemented efficiently for experimentally determining the presence of tri - partite entanglement , they are among the most sensitive , or finest , known witnesses . thus , if these witnesses do not detect the presence of entanglement neither will any of the effeciently implementable witnesses",
    "i will compare the detection ability of the witnesses to the evolution of the concurrence @xcite , @xmath5 , for measuring the bi - partite entanglement between qubits @xmath6 and @xmath7 after partial trace over one qubit .",
    "the concurrence of a two qubit state with density matrix @xmath8 is defined as the maximum of zero and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and the @xmath11 are the eigenvalues of @xmath12 in decreasing order , where @xmath13 is the @xmath14 pauli matrix of qubit @xmath15 .",
    "other entanglement measures that i will look at are the negativity , @xmath16 , for which i will use the sum of the absolute values of the negative eigenvalues of the partial transpose of the density matrix @xcite with respect to one qubit , and the tri - partite negativity , @xmath17 , a tri - partite entanglement measure for mixed states which is simply the third root of the product of the negativities with respect to each of three qubits @xcite .",
    "if the negativity is the same when taking the partial transpose with respect to any of the three qubits , @xmath18 .",
    "we look at a three qubit system , with no interaction between the qubits , placed in a dephasing environment fully described by the kraus operators @xmath19 where the dephasing parameter @xmath20 can also be written in a time - dependent fashion @xmath21 . when all three qubits undergo dephasing we have eight kraus operators each of the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",

    "for @xmath34 the entanglement witness @xmath35 gives @xmath36 which decays exponentially with time .",
    "in other words , the state can always be detected by a w - state witness and does not exhibit tri - partite esd @xcite .",

    "@xcite . due to the fragility of certain quantum states",

    "the goal is to determine whether esd is a reliable signature to the success or failure of the code .    to encode the state @xmath91 into the phase flip code one simply uses the unencoded qubit as the control of two controlled - not gates each gate implemented between itself and an additional qubit in state @xmath92",

    "we use the follwing w - state witness to detect all types of tri - partite entangement @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a hadamard on all three qubits .",
    "detection of a possible error is done via syndrome measurement .    when only one of the three physical qubits undergoes dephasing there are parameters of the intial state @xmath98 and the dephasing parameter , @xmath20 , which lead to finite time non - detection of entanglement in the error state @xmath99 by the entanglement witness @xmath100",
    ". however , there is no esd of @xmath16 or @xmath17 ( though @xmath101 ) .",
    "the three qubit qec code always corrects the error .",

    "when all three qubits are placed in a dephasing environment ( where , for simplicity we have assumed that the dephasing parameter @xmath20 is the same for all three qubits and thus ensure that @xmath18 ) the density matrix after the dephasing , @xmath102 , exhibits tri - partite esd , as shown in fig .",
    "moreover , the qec code will not , in general , completely protect the encoded quantum information .",
    "we can measure the effectiveness of the qec code by looking at the purity , @xmath103 of the final single qubit state , @xmath104 after error correction and decoding or by looking at the fidelity of @xmath104 to the initial state .",
    "for the case at hand these two measures exhibit almost the exact same behavior .",
    "we can then ask whether the parameters for which this indicator is minimized ( maximized ) are those which exhibit ( do not exhibit ) esd .",
    "we note that in general @xmath104 , and thus the purity , @xmath105 , will depend on whether or not the syndrome measurement detects an error or not . the purity of the final decoded state for both cases is shown in fig .",
    "[ qec ] .",
    "when @xmath106 the qec code perfectly corrects even complete dephasing on all three qubits depite the onset of tri - partite esd . as @xmath107 moves away from this point the purity decreases as a function of @xmath20 , due to the inability of the qec to correct the dephasing .",
    "not surprisingly , some regions of low purity correspond to regions that exhibit esd . however , even error regions in which the entanglement is detected by the entanglement witness can exhibit purity below @xmath108 .",
    "this suggests that , for the particular qec code studied here , any correlation between esd and the success of the code is not fundamental .",

    "in addition , i have found a state in which there is no concurrence nor tri - partite negativity but entanglement as measured by the negativity still exists .",
    "based on these exploration i considered whether esd affects the workings of the three - qubit qec phase flip code and concluded that there is no fundamental relationship between esd and the failure of the code .    as the number of system qubits grow studies of entanglement become more complex as the number of different types of entanglement continually increase .",
