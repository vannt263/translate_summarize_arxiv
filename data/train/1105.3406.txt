    "@xmath0-betti numbers originated from topology , but have later unveiled an interesting connection to operator algebras . indeed ,",
    "while the original definition of @xmath0-betti numbers for groups involved a geometric construction @xcite , it was later shown by lck ( see also @xcite ) that they can also be described in terms of certain @xmath1 modules  thus using only homological algebra and modules over von neumann algebras .",
    "this has led to several generalizations of @xmath0-betti numbers : they have been defined for discrete measured groupoids @xcite , quantum groups @xcite and general subalgebras of finite von neumann algebras @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xmath0-betti numbers were introduced in the setting of equivalence relations in @xcite following the original geometric approach , but as shown in @xcite these can also be expressed in terms of homological algebra .",
    "there are two properties which attract attention in all these situations .",
    "firstly , in each case the definition involves certain operator algebras canonically associated with the situation at hand .",
    "secondly , for groups , quantum groups and groupoids it is well known that the @xmath0-betti numbers vanish in the presence of amenability . in view of this , it is natural to seek a common operator algebraic reason for this to happen . in doing so",
    ", one firstly observes that the actual reason for the vanishing of @xmath0-betti numbers for amenable groups and quantum groups is a certain dimension - flatness property of an inclusion @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a strongly dense @xmath4-subalgebra of a finite von neumann algebra @xmath5 .",
    "secondly , the key to the proof of this dimension - flatness result is a flner condition for the notion of amenability in question . in the present paper",
    "we introduce a flner type condition for a general weakly dense @xmath6-subalgebra @xmath3 in a tracial von neumann algebra @xmath7 and show how this leads to dimension - flatness of the inclusion @xmath2 and subsequently to the vanishing of the operator algebraic @xmath0-betti numbers @xmath8 .",
    "this approach unifies the above mentioned vanishing results and furthermore provides a large class of new examples of algebras with vanishing @xmath0-betti numbers ( see section [ example - section ] ) .",
    "more precisely , we prove the following :    if @xmath9 satisfies the flner condition then for any left @xmath3-module @xmath10 and any @xmath11 we have @xmath12 and the connes - shlyakhtenko @xmath0-betti numbers of @xmath3 vanish in positive degrees .",
    "secondly , we link our flner condition to the classical operator algebraic notion of amenability by proving ( a slightly more general version of ) the following :    if @xmath2 satisfies the flner condition @xmath5 is injective .",
    "the flner condition consists of two requirements : an almost invariance property and a trace approximation property .",
    "the almost invariance property requires that the left action of @xmath3 on @xmath13 admits almost invariant subspaces , the almost invariance being measured by a dimension function .",
    "the naive approach would be to use the usual dimension over @xmath14 and require these subspaces to be finite - dimensional ; however , it turns out that the dimension theory over a von neumann subalgebra @xmath15 can be efficiently applied in order to allow for almost invariant subspaces which are finitely generated projective @xmath16-modules ( thus usually having infinite dimension over @xmath14 ) . for this reason , parts of the paper deals with results related to dimension theory for modules over von neumann algebras ;",
    "the reader not familiar with these notions may , without loosing the essential ideas , think of the case @xmath17 , which reduces most arguments to finite dimensional linear algebra .",
    "+ _ structure : _ the paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "we recapitulate lck s dimension theory for modules over von neumann algebras and prove a few results concerning a relative dimension function in this context . in the third section",
    "we introduce the operator - algebraic flner condition and draw some easy consequences , preparing for the proof of the main theorem which is given in the fourth section .",
    "the fifth section is devoted to the discussion concerning the relationship between the flner condition for an algebra and injectivity of its enveloping von neumann algebra . in the sixth section",
    "we discuss examples and show how the flner condition implies vanishing of @xmath0-betti numbers in a variety of different instances .",
    "+ _ assumptions : _ throughout the paper , all generic von neumann algebras are assumed to have separable predual .",
    "our main focus will be on finite von neumann algebras , for which separability of the predual is equivalent to separability of the von neumann algebra itself for the strong , weak and ultra - weak topology .",
    "these topologies are furthermore all metrizable on bounded subsets of @xmath5 . in order to be consistent with the general hilbert @xmath18-module terminology ( see below ) inner products on hilbert spaces are assumed to be linear in the second variable and conjugate linear in the first .",
    "algebraic tensor products are denoted `` @xmath19 '' , tensor products of hilbert spaces by `` @xmath20 '' and tensor products of von neumann algebras by @xmath21  .",
    "our main setup will consist of an inclusion @xmath22 of finite von neumann algebras with a fixed normal tracial state @xmath23 on @xmath5 .",
    "the von neumann algebra @xmath16 should be thought of as a `` coefficient algebra '' and will in many applications be equal to @xmath24 .",
    "we denote by @xmath25 the gns - space @xmath26 , by @xmath27 the modular conjugation arising from @xmath23 and by @xmath28 the @xmath23-preserving conditional expectation .",

    "in this section we recapitulate parts of the von neumann dimension theory for modules over a finite von neumann algebra and introduce a relative version of this notion of dimension . the relative dimension function will play a prominent role in the definition of the flner condition given in section [ foelner - section ] .",
