    "utilization of quantum mechanical tunneling through classically localized states in annealing of glasses has opened up a new paradigm for solving hard optimization problems through adiabatic reduction of quantum fluctuations .",
    "this will be introduced and reviewed here .",
    "consider the example of a ferromagnet consisting of @xmath0 tiny interacting magnetic elements ; the spins .",
    "for a macroscopic sample @xmath0 is very large ; of the order of avogadro number .",
    "assume that each spin can be in any of the two simple states : up or down . also , the pairwise interactions between the spins are such that the energy of interaction ( potential energy or pe ) between any pair of spins is negative ( smaller ) if both the spins in the pair are in the same state and is positive ( higher ) if their states differ . as such ,",
    "the collective energy of the @xmath0-spin system ( given by the hamiltonian @xmath1 ) is minimum when all the spins are aligned in the same direction ; all up or all down , giving the full order .",
    "we call these two minimum energy configurations the ground states . the rest of the @xmath2 configurations",
    "are called excited states .",
    "the plot of the interaction energy of the whole system with respect to the configurations is called the potential energy - configuration landscape , or simply , the potential energy landscape ( pel ) . for a ferromagnet",
    ", this landscape has a smooth double - valley structure ( two mirror - symmetric valleys with the two degenerate ground states , all up and all down , at their respective bottoms ) . at zero - temperature",
    "the equilibrium state is the state of minimum potential energy , and the system stably resides at the bottom of any of the two valleys . at finite temperature ,",
    "the thermal fluctuations allow the system to visit higher energy configurations with some finite probability ( given by the boltzmann factor ) and thus the system spends time in other part of the pel also .",
    "the probability that a system is found in a particular macroscopic state depends not only on the energy of the state ( as at zero temperature ) , but also on its entropy .",
    "the thermodynamic equilibrium state corresponds to the minimum of a thermodynamic potential called free energy @xmath3 given by the difference between the energy of the state and the product of its entropy and the temperature . at zero - temperature",
    ", the minima of the free energy coincides with the minimum for energy and one gets the highest order ( magnetization ) .",
    "as the temperature is increased , the contribution of entropy gets magnified and the minimum of the free energy is shifted more and more towards the states with lower and lower order or magnetization , until at ( and beyond ) some transition temperature @xmath4 , the order disappears completely . for antiferromagnetic systems ,",
    "the spin - spin pair interactions are such that it is lower if the spins in the pair are in opposite states , and higher if their states are same . for antiferromagnets",
    "one can still define a sub - lattice order or magnetization and the pel still has the double - well structure like in a ferromagnet for short range interactions .",
    "the free energy and the order - disorder transition also shows identical behavior as observed for a ferromagnet .    in spin glasses , where different spin - spin interactions are randomly ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic and frozen in time ( quenched disorder ) , the pel becomes extremely rugged ; various local and global minima trapped between potential energy barriers appears in the pel .",
    "the ruggedness and the degeneracies in the minima comes from the effect of frustration or competing interactions between the spins ; none of the spin states on a cluster or a placket is able to satisfy all the interactions in the cluster .",
    "the locally optimal state for the spins in the cluster is therefore degenerate and frustrated .",
    "similar situations occur for multivariate optimization problems like the traveling salesman problem ( tsp ) . here",
    "a salesman has to visit @xmath0 cities placed randomly on a plane ( country ) . of the @xmath5 distinct tours passing through each city once , only few corresponds to the minimum ( ground state ) travel distance or travel cost .",
    "the rests corresponds to the higher costs ( excited states ) .",
    "the cost function , when plotted against different tour configurations , gives a similar rugged landscape , equivalent to the pel of a spin glass ( henceforth we will use pel to mean cost - configuration landscapes also ) .    obviously , an exhaustive search for the global minimum of a rugged pel requires an exponentially large ( or higher ) number ( in @xmath0 ) of searches ( @xmath2 or @xmath6 order of searches for an @xmath0-spin spin glass and an @xmath0-city tsp respectively ) .",
    "the computational effort or time for such searches are therefore generally not bounded by any polynomial in the problem size @xmath0 .",
    "alternatively , a gradual energy or cost dissipative dynamics ( annealing ) , with boltzmann like thermal fluctuations or some noise factor ( in order to get out of the the local minima ) in the pel may help reaching deep enough minima more easily .",
    "this simulated thermal annealing scheme is considered to be a very successful technique now .",
    "however , such a technique often fails if the barrier heights between the minima diverges ( or become very high ) , as in case of a spin glass , due to frequent trapping of the system in such local minima ( glassy behavior ) . in case",
    "such barriers are very narrow , quantum - mechanical fluctuations ( fluctuations in a quantum observable due to its non - commutativity with the hamiltonian of the system ) can help tunneling through them , thereby leading to successful quantum annealing ( see . fig .",
    "[ qa - sa ] ) .",
    "we introduce here these ideas in details through successive steps .",
    "\\a ) the physics of classical spin glasses has already contributed enormously to our knowledge of the landscape structure of the energy or the thermodynamic potentials and that of the unusually slow ( glassy ) dynamics of many - body systems in the presence of frustration and disorder .",
    "mapping of computationally hard problems , like the traveling salesman problem etc , to classical spin glass models also helped understanding their complexity .",
    "\\b ) the ground ( and some low - lying ) state structures of frustrated random systems in the presence of quantum fluctuations have also been studied in the context of quantum spin glasses .",
    "it has been shown that because of the possibility of tunneling through the barriers in the potential energy landscape , quantum fluctuations can help the dynamics to be ` more ergodic ' than the dynamics induced by the classical fluctuations and thus help exploring the landscape much better .",
    "ergodicity here means the loss of the memory of the initial state in course of evolution ( weak ergodicity ) and the convergence to a stationary distribution irrespective of the the initial state ( strong ergodicity ) .",
    "the nature of these quantum phase transitions in such systems have also been extensively studied .",
    "these studies ( sec .",
    "iid ) endow one with the knowledge of the phase diagram and the location of the quantum critical point or the phase boundary , which is crucial for choosing the proper quantum kinetic terms and the annealing path ( sec . iiia and sec .",
    "iiib ) .",
    "\\c ) the most natural connection between the paradigm of classical spin glasses and hard optimization problems comes through a widely used and well established optimization technique , namely , simulated annealing algorithm as discussed earlier .",
    "the possibility of quantum tunneling through classically impenetrable barriers , as indicated from the studies of quantum spin glasses , naturally suggests an elegant and often more effective alternative to simulated annealing .    in quantum annealing , one has a classical hamiltonian ( or a multivariate cost function viewed as the same ) to be optimized , to which , one adds a ( non - commuting ) quantum kinetic term and reduce it from a very high initial value to zero eventually .",
    "this reduction , when done completely adiabatically , assures reaching of the ground state of the classical glass at the end , assuming that there is no crossing of energy levels with the ground state in the course of evolution , and provided that the starting state was the ground state of the initial hamiltonian . to start with",
    ", the tunneling field is much higher than the interaction term , so the ground state ( a uniform superposition of all classical configurations ) is trivially realizable .",
    "simulations clearly demonstrate that quantum annealing can occasionally help reaching the ground state of a complex glassy system much faster than could be done using thermal annealing ( discussed later in sec .",
    "an experiment comparing the classical and quantum annealing for a spin glass also shows that the relaxations in course of quantum annealing are often much faster than those during the corresponding classical annealing , as discussed in sec .",
    "what makes quantum annealing fundamentally different from the classical annealing , is the non - local nature ( sec .",
    "iii ) and its higher tunneling ability ( secs .",
    "iid & iiic ) .",
    "quantum annealing thus permits a realization of analog quantum computation , which is an independent and powerful complement to digital quantum computation , where discrete unitary transformations are implemented through quantum logic gates .",
    "the occurrence of multivariate optimization problems is ubiquitous in our life , wherever one has to choose the best bargain from a host of available options that depend on many independent factors . in many cases",
    ", such a task can be cast as a problem of minimizing a given cost or energy function @xmath7 with respect to @xmath0 variables @xmath8 ( sometimes subject to some constraints ) .",
    "the task is to find a set of values for these variables ( a configuration ) for which the function @xmath9 has the minimum value ( cf . fig .",
    "[ qa - sa ] ) . in many important optimization problems ,",
    "the set of feasible configurations from which an optimum is to be chosen is a finite set ( for finite @xmath0 ) .",
    "in such a case , we say that the problem is combinatorial in nature . if the variables @xmath10 are discrete and each takes up a finite number of values , then the problem is clearly a combinatorial one .",
    "moreover , certain problems with continuous variables ( like linear programming problem ) can also be reduced to combinatorial problems ( papadimitriou et al 1998 ) . here",
    "we focus on this type of optimization problem , and assume that we have to minimize @xmath9 with respect to the discrete set of the variables @xmath10 .",
    "an optimization problem is said to belong to the class p ( p for polynomial ) , if it can be solved in polynomial time ( i.e. , the evaluation time goes like some polynomial in @xmath0 ) using polynomially ( in @xmath0 , again ) bound resources ( computer space , processors etc ) .",
    "existence of such a polynomial bound on the evaluation time is somehow interpreted as the `` easiness '' of the problem . however , many important optimization problems seem to fall outside this class , like , the famous traveling salesman problem ( see sec .",
    "iic.2 ) .    there is another important class of problems which can be solved in polynomial time by non - deterministic machines .",
    "this class is the famous np ( non - deterministic polynomial ) class ( garey and johnson 1979 ) .",
    "p is included completely in the np class , since a deterministic turing machine is just a special case of non - deterministic turing machines . unlike a deterministic machine , which takes a specific step deterministically at each instant ( and hence follows a single computational path ) ,",
    "a non - deterministic machine has a host of different ` allowed ' steps at its disposal at every instant . at each instant",
    "it explores all the ` allowed ' steps and if any of them leads to the goal , the job is considered to be done .",
    "thus it explores in parallel many paths ( whose number goes roughly exponentially with time ) and checks if any one of them reaches the goal .    among the np problems ,",
    "there are certain problems ( known as np - complete problems ) which are such that any np problem can be `` reduced '' to them using a polynomial algorithm .",
    "the famous 3-sat problem ( see sec .",
    "iiia.3 ) is a representative of the class .",
    "this roughly means that if one has a routine to solve an np - complete problem of size @xmath0 then using that routine one can solve any np problem at the cost of an extra overhead in time that goes only polynomially with @xmath0 . the problems in this class are considered to be hard , since so far no one can simulate a general nondeterministic machine by a deterministic turing machine ( or any sequential computer with polynomially bound resources ) without an exponential growth of execution time . in fact it is largely believed ( though not proved yet ) that it is impossible to do so ( i.e. , p@xmath11np ) in principle .",
    "however , assuming this to be true , one can show that there are indeed problems in np class that are neither np - complete nor p ( garey and johnson 1979 ) .",
    "there are some excellent deterministic algorithms for solving certain optimization problems exactly ( papadimitriou and steiglitz 1998 , hartmann and rieger , 2002 ) .",
    "these algorithms are , however , quite small in number and are strictly problem specific . for np or harder problems",
    ", only approximate results can be found using these algorithms in polynomial time .",
    "these approximate algorithms too are also strictly problem specific in the sense that if one can solve a certain np - complete problem up to a certain approximation using some polynomial algorithm , then that does not ensure that one can solve all other np problems using it up to the said approximation in polynomial time .",
    "exact algorithms being scarce , one has to go for heuristics algorithms , which are algorithms based on certain intuitive moves , without any guarantee on either the accuracy or the run time for the worst case instance",
    ". however , these algorithms are generally easy to formulate and are quite effective in solving most instances of a the intended problems .",
    "a general approach towards formulating such approximate heuristics may be based on stochastic ( randomized ) iterative improvements .",
    "the most preliminary one in this family is the local minimization algorithm . in this algorithm one",
    "starts with a random configuration @xmath12 and makes some local changes in the configuration following some prescription ( stochastic or deterministic ) to generate a new configuration @xmath13 and calculates the corresponding change in the cost .",
    "if the cost is lowered by the change , then the new configuration @xmath13 is adopted .",
    "otherwise the old configuration is retained .",
    "then in the next step a new local change is attempted again , and so on .",
    "this reduces the cost steadily until a configuration is reached which minimizes the cost locally .",
    "this means that no further lowering of cost is possible by changing this configuration using any of the prescribed local moves .",
    "the algorithm essentially stops there .",
    "but generally in most optimization problems ( such as in spin glasses ) , there occur many local minima in the cost - configuration landscape and they are mostly far above the global minimum ( see fig .",
    "[ qa - sa ] ) .",
    "it is likely that the algorithm therefore gets stuck in one of them and ends up with a poor approximation .",
    "one can then start afresh with some new initial configuration and end up with another local minimum . after repeating this for several times , each time with a new initial configuration",
    ", one may choose the best result from them .",
    "but much better idea would be to get somehow out of shallow local minima .",
    "one can introduce some fluctuations or noise in the process so that the movement is not always towards lower energy configurations , but there is also a finite probability to go to higher energy configurations ( the higher the final energy , the lower the probability to move to that ) , and consequently there appear chances to get out of the shallow local minima .",
    "initially , strong fluctuations are adopted ( i.e. , the probability to go to higher energy configurations is relatively high ) and slowly fluctuations are reduced until finally they are tuned off completely . in the mean time the system gets a fair opportunity to explore the landscape more exhaustively and settle into a reasonably deep cost or energy minimum .",
    "kirkpartick et al ( 1983 ) suggested an elegant way : a fluctuation is implemented by introducing an `` artificial '' temperature @xmath14 into the problem such that the transition probability from a configuration @xmath15 to a configuration @xmath16 is given by @xmath17}\\}}$ ] , where @xmath18 , with @xmath19 denoting the cost or energy of the configuration @xmath20 .",
    "a corresponding monte carlo dynamics is defined , say , based on detailed balance , and the thermal relaxation of the system is simulated . in course of simulation ,",
    "the noise factor @xmath14 is reduced slowly from a very high initial value to zero following some annealing schedule . at the end of the simulation one",
    "is expected to end up with a configuration whose cost is a reasonable approximation of the globally minimum one .",
    "if the temperature is decreased slow enough , say , @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the cooling time and @xmath0 the system size , then the global minimum is attained with certainty in the limit @xmath23 ( geman and geman 1984 ) . even within a finite time and with a faster cooling rate",
    ", one can achieve a reasonably good approximation ( a crystal with only few defects ) in practice .",
    "this simulated annealing method is now being used extensively by engineers for devising real - life optimization algorithms .",
    "we will refer to this as the classical annealing ( ca ) , to distinguish it from quantum annealing ( qa ) which employs quantum fluctuations .",
    "it is important to note that though in this type of stochastic algorithms the system has many different steps with their respective probabilities at its disposal , it finally takes up a single one , say by tossing coins , and thus finally follow a single ( stochastically selected ) path . hence it is not equivalent to a non - deterministic machine , where all the allowed paths are checked in parallel at every time - step .",
    "as has been mentioned already , many combinatorial optimization problems can be cast into the problem of finding the ground state of some classical ( spin glass like ) hamiltonian @xmath24 .",
    "one can therefore analyze the problem by using statistical mechanics so as to to apply physical techniques like simulated annealing .",
    "if one naively takes the number of variables @xmath0 as the size , then the entropy and the energy are often found to scale differently with @xmath0 and the application of standard thermodynamic arguments become difficult .",
    "one needs to scale temperature and some other quantities properly with @xmath0 so that one can talk in terms of the concepts like free energy minimization etc .",
    "moreover , the constraints present in the problems are often very difficult to take into account .",
    "as has been mentioned already , the difficulty faced by a physically motivated optimization heuristic ( one that follows physical relaxation dynamics , classical or quantum , to search for the solution ) , in finding the solution of a hard optimization problem , is similar to that faced by a glassy system in reaching its ground state . in fact , finding the ground states of the spin glasses is an important class of combinatorial optimization problem , which includes an np - complete problem ( barahona 1982 ) , and many other apparently different ones ( like the traveling salesman problem ) can be recast in this form .",
    "hence here we discuss very briefly the nature of the spin glass phase and the difficulty in reaching its ground state .",
    "the interaction energy of a typically random and frustrated ising spin glass ( binder and young 1986 , nishimori 2001 , dotsenko 2001 ) may be represented by a hamiltonian of the form    @xmath25    where @xmath26 denote the ising spins and @xmath27 the interactions between them .",
    "these @xmath27s here are quenched variables which vary randomly both in sign and magnitude following some distribution @xmath28 .",
    "the typical distributions are ( zero mean ) gaussian distribution of positive and negative @xmath27 values @xmath29 and binary distribution @xmath30 with probability @xmath31 of having a @xmath32 bond , and @xmath33 of having a @xmath34 bond .",
    "two well studied models are the sk model ( introduced by sherrington and kirkpatrick 1975 ) and the ea model ( introduced by edward and anderson 1975 ) . in the sk model",
    "the interactions are infinite - ranged and for the sake of extensively ( for rules of equilibrium thermodynamics to be applicable , energy should be proportional to the volume or its equivalent that defines the system - size ) one has to scale @xmath35 , while in the ea model , the interactions are between the nearest neighbors only . for both of them , however , @xmath28 is gaussian ; @xmath36 for normalization in the sk model .",
    "the freezing ( below @xmath4 ) is characterized by some non - zero value of the thermal average of the magnetization at each site ( local ordering ) . however , since the interactions are random and competing , the spatial average of single - site magnetization ( below @xmath37 ) is zero . above @xmath37 , both the spatial and the temporal averages of the single - site magnetization of course vanishes .",
    "a relevant order parameter for this freezing is therefore @xmath38 ( overhead bar denoting the average over disorders ( the distribution of @xmath27 ) and @xmath39 denotes the thermal average ) . here",
    "@xmath40 for @xmath41 , while @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "as will be seen in the following , the existence of a unique order parameter @xmath44 will indicate ergodicity .    in the spin glass phase ( @xmath45 )",
    ", the whole free energy landscape gets divided ( cf .",
    "[ qa - sa ] ) into many valleys ( local minima of free energy ) separated by very high free energy barriers .",
    "thus the system , once trapped in a valley , remains there for a very long time .",
    "the spins of such a confined system are allowed to explore only a very restricted ( and correlated ) part of the configuration space and thus makes them `` freeze '' to have a magnetization that characterizes the state ( valley ) locally .",
    "so far , two competing pictures continue to represent the physics of the spin glasses .",
    "the mean - field picture of replica symmetry - breaking is valid for infinite - ranged spin glass systems like the sk spin glass . in this picture , below the glass transition temperature @xmath4 , the barriers separating the valleys in the free energy landscape actually diverge ( in the limit @xmath46 ) , giving rise to a diverging timescale for the confinement of the system in any such valley once the system gets there somehow .",
    "this means there is a loss of ergodicity in the thermal dynamics of the system at @xmath47 .",
    "thus one needs a distribution @xmath48 of order parameters , instead of a single order parameter to characterize the whole landscape , as emerges naturally from the replica symmetry - breaking ansatz of parisi ( 1980 ) . to be a bit more quantitative ,",
    "let us imagine that two identical replicas ( having exactly the same set @xmath27s ) of a spin glass sample are allowed to relax thermally below @xmath37 , starting from two different random ( paramagnetic ) initial states .",
    "then these two replicas ( labeled by @xmath49 and @xmath50 , say ) will settle in two different valleys , each being characterized by a local value of the order parameter and the corresponding overlap parameters @xmath51 having a sample - specific distribution @xmath52 @xmath53    here the subscript @xmath54 denotes a particular sample with a given realization of quenched random interactions ( @xmath27s ) between the spins , and finally averaging @xmath55 over disorder distribution @xmath56 in ( 2 ) or ( 3 ) one gets @xmath48 .",
    "physically , @xmath48 gives the probability distribution for the two pure states to have an overlap @xmath44 , assuming that the probability of reaching any pure state @xmath49 starting from a random ( high temperature ) state is proportional to the thermodynamic weight @xmath57 of the state @xmath49 .",
    "the other picture is due to the droplet model of short - range spin glass ( bray and moore 1984 , fisher and huse 1986 ) , where there is no divergence in the typical free energy barrier height and the relevant timescale is taken to be that of crossing the free energy barrier of formation of a typical droplet of same ( all up or all down ) spins .",
    "based on certain scaling ansatz , this picture leads to a logarithmically decaying ( with time ) self - correlation function for the spins below the freezing temperature @xmath58    the issue of the validity of the mean - field picture ( of the replica symmetry - breaking ) in the context of the real - life spin glasses , where the interactions are essentially short - range , is far from settled ( see e.g. , moore et al 1998 , marinari et al 1998 , krzakala et al 2001 and gaviro et al 2006 ) .",
    "however , the effective hamiltonian ( cost function ) for many other optimization problems may contain long - range interactions and may even show the replica symmetry - breaking behavior shown in the graph partitioning problem ( fu and anderson 1986 ) .",
    "of course , no result of qa for such system ( for which replica symmetry - breaking is shown explicitly ) has been reported yet .",
    "the successes of qa reported so far are mostly for short - range systems .",
    "thus , the scope of quantum annealing in those long - range systems still stands out as an interesting open question .      in the traveling salesman problem ( tsp )",
    ", there are @xmath0 cities placed randomly in a country having a definite metric to calculate the inter - city distances .",
    "a salesman has to make a tour to cover every city and finally come back to the starting point .",
    "the problem is to find a tour of minimum length .",
    "an instance of the problem is given by a set @xmath59 @xmath60 , where @xmath61 indicates the distance between the @xmath62-th and the @xmath63-th city , or equivalently , the cost for going from the former to the later .",
    "we mainly focus on the results of symmetric case , where @xmath64 .",
    "the problem can be cast into the form where one minimizes an ising hamiltonian under some constraints , as shown below .",
    "a tour can be represented by an @xmath65 matrix @xmath66 with elements either @xmath67 or @xmath68 . in a given tour , if the city @xmath63 is visited immediately after visiting city @xmath62 , then @xmath69 , or else @xmath70 .",
    "generally an additional constraint is imposed that one city has to be visited once and only once in a tour .",
    "any valid tour with the above restriction may be represented by a @xmath66 matrix whose each row and each column has one and only one element equal to @xmath68 and rest all are @xmath67s . for symmetric",
    "a metric , a tour and its reverse tour have the same length , and it is more convenient to work with an undirected tour matrix @xmath71 , where @xmath72 , the transpose of @xmath66 , represents the reverse of the tour given by @xmath66 . clearly , @xmath73 must be a symmetric matrix having two and only two distinct entries equal to @xmath68 in every row and every column , no two rows being identical , and so is not any two columns . in terms of @xmath74s , the length of a tour",
    "can be represented by @xmath75 one can rewrite the above hamiltonian in terms of ising spins @xmath76s as @xmath77 where @xmath78 are the ising spins .",
    "the hamiltonian is similar to that of a non - interacting ising spins on an @xmath65 lattice , with random fields @xmath61 on the lattice points @xmath79 .",
    "the frustration is introduced by the global constraints on the spin configurations in order to conform with the structure of the matrix @xmath73 discussed above .",
    "the problem is to find the ground state of the hamiltonian subject to these constraints .",
    "there are @xmath80 ising spins , which can assume @xmath81 configurations in absence of any constraint , but the constraint here reduces the number of valid configurations to that of the number of distinct tours , which is @xmath82 .",
    "mainly two distinct classes of tsp are studied : one with an euclidean @xmath61 in finite dimension ( where @xmath61 are strongly correlated through triangle inequalities , which means , for any three cities @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , the sum of any two of the side @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 must be greater than the remaining one ) , and the other with random @xmath61 in infinite dimension .    in the first case ,",
    "@xmath0 cities are uniformly distributed within a hypercube in a @xmath89-dimensional euclidean space . finding a good approximation for large @xmath0 is easier for this case , since the problem is finite - ranged . here a @xmath89-dimensional neighborhood is defined for each city , and the problem can be solved by dividing the whole hypercube into a number of smaller pieces and then searching for the least path within each smaller part and joining them back . the correction to the true least path will be due to the unoptimized connections across the boundaries of the subdivisions . for a suitably made division ( not too small ) , this correction will be of the order of the surface - to - volume ratio of each division , and thus will tend to zero in the @xmath90 limit .",
    "this method , known as `` divide and conquer '' , forms a reasonable strategy for solving approximately such finite - range optimization problems ( including finite - range spin glasses ) in general . in the second case ,",
    "@xmath61s are assigned completely randomly , with no geometric ( e.g. , euclidean ) correlation between them .",
    "the problem in this case becomes more like a long - range spin glass .",
    "a self avoiding walk representation of the problem was made using an @xmath91-component vector field , and the replica analysis was done ( mezard et al 1987 ) for finite temperature , assuming replica symmetry ansatz to hold . moreover , true breaking of ergodicity may occur only in infinite systems , not in any finite instance of the problem .",
    "the results , when extrapolated to zero - temperature , do not disagree much with the numerical results ( mezard et al 1987 ) . the stability of a replica symmetric solution has not yet been proved for low temperature region . however , numerical results of thermal annealing for instances of size @xmath92 to @xmath93 yielded many near optimal tours , and the corresponding overlap analysis shows a sharply peaked distribution , whose width decreases steadily with increase in @xmath0 .",
    "this indicates the existence of a replica symmetric phase for the system ( mezard et al 1987 ) .",
    "an analytical bound on the average ( normalized by @xmath94 ) value of optimal path - length per city ( @xmath95 ) calculated for tsp on 2-dimensional euclidean plane has been found to be @xmath96 ( bearwood et al 1959 ) .",
    "careful scaling analysis of the numerical results obtained so far indicates the lower bound to be close to @xmath97 ( percus and martin 1996 , chakraborti and chakrabarti 2000 ) .",
    "simulated ( thermal ) annealing of a euclidean tsp on a square having length @xmath94 ( so as to render the average nearest neighbor distance independent of @xmath0 ) has been reported ( kirkpatrick et al 1983 ) . in this choice of length unit ,",
    "the optimal tour length per step ( @xmath95 ) becomes independent of @xmath0 for large @xmath0 .",
    "thermal annealing rendered @xmath98 for @xmath0 up to @xmath99 cities .",
    "this is much better than what is obtained by the so called `` greedy heuristics '' , ( where being at some city in a step , one moves to the nearest city not in the tour in the next step ) for which @xmath100 on average .",
    "later we will see that ( sec .",
    "iiia ) that quantum annealing can do even better than thermal annealing in context of random tsp .    to summarize , when cast in some energy minimization problem , the combinatorial optimization problems may exhibit glassy behavior during thermal annealing .",
    "even replica symmetry - breaking behavior may be observed ( like in case of graph partitioning problem , see fu and anderson 1986 ) , since the underlying hamiltonian need not be short - range , and the constraints can bring frustrations into the problem .",
    "one can intuitively conclude that thermal annealing or other heuristics would not be able to solve such problems easily to a good approximation within reasonable time .",
    "moreover , practically nothing can be said about the time required to solve the worst case instance exactly .",
    "specifically , in some cases , where good solutions are thermodynamically very insignificant in number and there is no monotonic gradient towards them , the entropy might make a classical search exponentially difficult , though the landscape might still remain completely ergodic . later",
    "we will see quantum searches can bring about spectacular improvements in some such cases ( see sec .",
    "iiib and fig .",

    "however , slow withdrawal ( see eq . [ adia - cond ] for the characteristic slowness ) of the tunneling field in these quantum spin glasses can help annealing the system close to the ground state of the classical spin glass eventually , as has been described in the next section .",
    "in the previous sections we have seen how thermal fluctuations can be utilized to devise fast heuristics to find an approximate ground state of a glassy system , or equivalently , a near - optimal solution to combinatorial problem , whose cost - configuration landscape has glassy behavior due to the occurrence of many local minima .",
    "there are two aspects of an optimization problem which might render thermal annealing to be a very ineffective one .",
    "first , in a glassy landscape , there may exist very high cost / energy barriers around local minima which does not correspond to a reasonably low cost ( see fig .",
    "[ qa - sa ] ) . in the case of infinite - range problems",
    ", these barriers might be proportional to the system - size @xmath0 , and thus diverge in thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus there might occur many unsatisfactory local minima , any of which can trap the system for very long time ( which actually diverges in thermodynamic limit for infinite - range systems ) in course of annealing .",
    "the second problem is the entropy itself .",
    "the number of configurations grow very fast with the number of variables ( roughly exponentially ; @xmath132 ising spin can be in @xmath133 configurations ) and a classical system can only assume one configuration at a time and unless there is a gradient that broadly guides the system towards the global minimum form any point in the configuration space , the search has to involve visiting any substantial fraction of the configurations .",
    "thus a pel without a guiding gradient poses a problem which is clearly of an exponential or higher order in complexity ( depending how the size of the configuration space scales with the system - size @xmath0 ) , and the ca algorithms can do no better than a random search algorithm .",
    "this is the case for golf - course type potential - energy landscape ( where there is a sharp potential minimum on completely flat pel ) ( see sec .",
    "iiib , fig .",
    "[ qan ] ) .",
    "one can imagine that quantum mechanics might have some solutions to both these problems , at least , to some extent .",
    "this is because quantum mechanics can introduce classically unlikely tunneling paths even through very high barriers if they are narrow enough ( ray et al 1989 ; see also apolloni et al 1989 , 1990 ) .",
    "this can solve the ergodicity problem to some extent , as discussed earlier . even in places where ergodicity breaking does not take place in true sense ,",
    "once the energy landscape contains high enough barriers ( specially for infinite - ranged quenched interactions ) , quantum tunneling may provide much faster relaxation to the ground state ( santoro et al 2002 , martonk et al 2002 ; see also santoro and tosatti 2007 , somma et al 2007 ) .",
    "in addition , a quantum mechanical wave function can delocalize over the whole configuration space ( i.e. , over the potential energy landscape ) if the kinetic energy term is high enough .",
    "thus it can actually  see \" the whole landscape simultaneously at some stage of annealing .",
    "these two aspects can be expected to improve the search process when employed properly .",
    "in fact such improvements can indeed be achieved in certain situations , though quantum mechanics is not a panacea for all such diseases as ergodicity breaking , spin glass behavior etc , and certainly has its own inherent limitations .",
    "what intrigues one is the fact that the limitations due to quantum nature of an algorithm are inherently different from those faced by its classical counterpart , and thus it is not yet clear in general which wins when . here",
    "we discuss some results regarding the quantum heuristics and some of their general aspects understood so far . for more detailed reviews of the subject",
    "we refer to the articles in das and chakrabarti ( 2005 ) and santoro and tosatti ( 2006 ) .",
    "some basic aspects of qa can be understood from the simple case of qa in the context of a double - well potential ( stella 2005 , battaglia et al 2005 ) .",
    "typically a particle in a double - well consisting of a shallower but wider well and a deeper but narrower well is annealed ( it is likely that the deeper well , i.e. , the target state , is narrower , otherwise the searching becomes easier even classically ) .",
    "the kinetic energy ( inverse mass ) is tuned from a very high value to zero linearly within a time @xmath134 . for a very high value of initial kinetic energy , the wave function , which is the ground state , is delocalized more or less over the whole double - well . as kinetic energy",
    "is reduced but still quite high , the ground state corresponds to a more pronounced peak on the shallower minimum , since it is wider .",
    "this is because at this stage , to obtain the minimal ( ground state ) energy , it is more effective to minimize the kinetic energy by localization over a wider space , rather than minimizing the potential energy by localizing in the deeper well .",
    "however , as kinetic energy is tuned down further , the potential energy term becomes dominating , and the ground state has a taller peak around the deeper minimum .",
    "the evolving wave function can roughly follow this ground state structure all the way and finally settle to the deeper minimum if the annealing time @xmath134 is greater than some @xmath135 .",
    "when @xmath47 it fails to tunnel from its early state localized in the shallower well to the deeper well as the kinetic energy is decreased .",
    "this result is qualitatively the same for both real - time and quantum monte carlo annealing , excepting for the fact that the @xmath135 s are different in the two cases .",
    "the realization of qa consists of employing adjustable quantum fluctuations into the problem instead of a thermal one ( kadowaki and nishimori 1998 , amara et al 1993 , finnila et al 1994 ) . in order to do that",
    ", one needs to introduce an artificial quantum kinetic term @xmath136 , which does not commute with the classical hamiltonian @xmath137 representing the cost function .",
    "the coefficient @xmath106 is the parameter which controls the quantum fluctuations .",
    "the total hamiltonian is thus given by @xmath138 the ground state of @xmath139 is a superposition of the eigenstates of @xmath140 . for a classical ising hamiltonian of the form ( [ spg - ham ] ) , the corresponding total quantum hamiltonian might have the form ( [ sk - q ] ) , where @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "initially @xmath106 is kept very high so that the @xmath143 dominates and the ground state is trivially a uniform superposition of all the classical configurations .",
    "one starts with that uniform superposition as the initial state , and slowly decreases @xmath106 following some annealing schedule , eventually to zero .",
    "if the process of decreasing is slow enough , the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics ( sarandy et al 2004 ) assures that the system will always remain at the instantaneous ground state of the evolving hamiltonian @xmath139.when @xmath106 is finally brought to zero , @xmath139 will coincide with the original classical hamiltonian @xmath144 and the system will be found in the ground state of it , as desired .",
    "the special class of qa algorithms , where strictly quasi - stationary or adiabatic evolutions are employed are also known as quantum adiabatic evolution algorithms ( farhi et al 2001 ) .",
    "two important questions are how to choose an appropriate @xmath143 and how slow the evolution needs to be in order to assure adiabaticity . according to the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics , for a non - degenerate spectrum with a gap between the ground state and first excited state ,",
    "the adiabatic evolution is assured if the evolution time @xmath134 satisfies the following condition- @xmath145 where @xmath146,\\ ] ] @xmath147 ;     \\quad s = t/\\tau;\\quad 0\\le s \\le 1 , \\label{adia - factors}\\ ] ] @xmath148 and @xmath149 being respectively the instantaneous ground state and the first excited state of the total hamiltonian @xmath139 , and @xmath150 the instantaneous gap between the ground state and the first excited state energies ( see sarandy et al 2004 ) .",
    "one may wonder that while entering the ordered phase ( @xmath151 ) from the para phase ( @xmath152 ) in course of annealing , the gap @xmath153 may vanish at the phase boundary ( @xmath154 ) in the @xmath46 limit .",
    "in fact , in such a case , qa can not help anyway in finding the ground state of an infinite system .",
    "however , for any finite sample , this gap is very unlikely to vanish for a random system , and qa may still work out nicely .",
    "however , it is impossible to follow , even for a finite @xmath0 , the evolution of a full wave function in a classical computer using polynomial resources in general , since it requires tracking the amplitudes of all the basis vectors ( all possible classical configurations ) , whose number grows exponentially with system - size @xmath0 . such an adiabatic evolution may be realized within polynomial resources only if one can employ a quantum mechanical system itself to mimic the dynamics .",
    "however , one may employ quantum monte carlo methods to simulate some dynamics ( not the real - time quantum dynamics ) to sample the ground state ( or a mixed state at low enough temperature ) for a given set of parameter values of the hamiltonian .",
    "annealing is done by reducing the strength @xmath106 of the quantum kinetic term in the hamiltonian from a very high value to zero following some annealing schedule in course of simulation . in case of such monte carlo annealing algorithm , there is no general bound on success time @xmath134 like the one provided by the adiabatic theorem for true schrdinger evolution annealing . here",
    "we will separately discuss the results of real - time qa and monte carlo qa .",
    "apart from these quasi - stationary quantum annealing strategies , where the system always stays close to some stationary state ( or low - temperature equilibrium state ) , there may be cases where quantum scatterings ( with tunable amplitudes ) are employed to anneal the system ( das et al 2005 ) .      in quantum monte",
    "carlo annealing , one may employ either a finite ( but low ) temperature algorithm , or a zero - temperature algorithm .",
    "most of the monte carlo qa ( das and chakrabarti 2005 , santoro and tosatti 2006 ) are done using a finite temperature monte carlo , namely , the path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) , since its implementation is somewhat simpler than that of other zero - temperature monte carlo methods . among the other zero - temperature monte carlo methods used for annealing are the zero - temperature transfer - matrix monte carlo ( the chapter by das and chakrabarti in das and chakrabarti , 2005 ) and the green s function monte carlo ( santoro and tosatti 2006 ) . however , these algorithms suffer severely from different drawbacks , which renders them much slower than pimc algorithms in practice .",
    "the green s function monte carlo effectively simulates the real - time evolution of the wave function during annealing . but to perform sensibly , it often requires a guidance that depends on a priori knowledge of the wave function . without this guidance it may fail miserably ( santoro and tosatti 2006 ) .",
    "but such a priori knowledge is very unlikely to be available in the case of random optimization problems , and hence so far the scope for this algorithm seems to be very restricted .",
    "the zero - temperature transfer - matrix monte carlo method , on the other hand , samples the ground state of the instantaneous hamiltonian ( specified by the given value of the parameters at that instant ) using a projective method , where the hamiltonian matrix itself ( a suitable linear transformation of the hamiltonian that converts into a positive matrix , in practice ) is viewed as the transfer - matrix of a finite - temperature classical system of one higher dimension ( das and chakrabarti 2005 ) .",
    "but the sparsity of the hamiltonian matrix for systems with local kinetic terms leaves the classical system highly constrained and thus very difficult to simulate efficiently for large system sizes .",
    "the pimc has so far been mostly used for qa .",
    "the basic idea of path - integral monte carlo rests on suzuki - trotter formalism ( see appendix 1 ) , which maps the partition function of a @xmath89-dimensional quantum hamiltonian @xmath155 to that of an effective classical hamiltonian @xmath156 in ( @xmath121)-dimension . quantum annealing of a hamiltonian @xmath139 using pimc consists of mapping @xmath139 to its equivalent classical one and simulate it at some fixed low temperature so that thermal fluctuations are low .",
    "the quantum fluctuations are reduced from some very high initial value to zero finally through reduction of @xmath106 in course of simulation .",
    "clearly , the simulation dynamics is not the true schrdinger evolution of the system , and also it can not simultaneously see the whole configuration space as does a delocalized wave function .",
    "it feels the landscape locally and makes moves just like a classical system .",
    "the first attempt of quantum annealing using pimc was done by kadowaki and nishimori ( 1998 ) for solving tsp and an extensive use of the technique to explore multitude of problems has been made by the group of santoro and tosatti ( 2006 ) . here we will discuss some pimc quantum annealing results briefly for few different systems .",

    "but in the case of the random 3-sat problem ( k - sat problem with k= 3 ) using linear schedule for decreasing @xmath106 , pimc - qa gives much worse results than ca ( battaglia et al 2004 ) . both ca and pimc - qa are worse than ad - hoc local search heuristics like walksat . in the case of application of pimc - qa in image restoration ,",
    "on the other hand , the performance is exactly the same as that of ca ( inoue 2005 ) . even for a particle in a simple double - well potential",
    ", it seems that with naive monte carlo moves , pimc - qa can produce results which are much worse than that one could obtain from real - time schrdinger evolution of the system .",
    "there is in fact no general prescription to choose the right moves that will do the job , unless one has a precise idea about the pel of the problem .",
    "the choice of the kinetic term to be introduced into the problem is somewhat arbitrary but the performance of the algorithm depends on crucially on that .",
    "it has been found that a relativistic kinetic term can do a better job than a non - relativistic one in the case of a particle in a double - well potential ( battaglia et al 2005 ) .",
    "pimc - qa also suffers from difficulty in calculating the suzuki - trotter equivalent of the quantum hamiltonian with arbitrary kinetic term designed to satisfy the constraints of the problem ( martonak et al , 2004 ) .",
    "the constraints may be taken care of while making monte carlo moves , but that may not always produce expected results . finally , presence of finite temperature in the problem does not allow one to focus exclusively on the role of the quantum fluctuations in the problem .",
    "above all , like any other monte carlo method , pimc - qa is going to do worse if the number of reasonably good approximate solutions are only few , and there is no overall gradient in the landscape to guide towards them .",
    "qa algorithms enjoy an extra flexibility which a thermal annealing algorithm can not .",
    "a qa algorithm can have a host of choices for its kinetic term .",
    "a good choice can bring about a lot of betterments .",
    "this point is illustrated nicely by morita and nishimori ( see morita and nishimori 2007a ) for qa of random field ising model , by introducing a ferro - magnetic transverse field interaction , in addition to the conventional single - spin - flip transverse field term ( as present in the hamiltonian ( [ sk - q ] ) ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the random - field ising model with the standard single - spin - flip transverse term is given by    @xmath196    where @xmath197 @xmath198 being the on site random field assuming values @xmath191 or @xmath199 with equal probabilities and @xmath200 denotes sum over the nearest neighbor on a 2-dimensional square lattice , and @xmath201 the result of qa in such a system in not satisfactory when @xmath54 is much larger than @xmath198 ( sarjala et al 2006 ) .",
    "if a ferromagnetic transverse term of the form @xmath202 is added to the hamiltonian ( [ rfim ] ) , the result of qa is seen to improve considerably ( morita and nishimori 2007a ) .",
    "this happens ( as indicated by exact diagonalization results on small system ) because the ferromagnetic transverse field term effectively increases the gap between the ground state and the first excited state and thus decreases the characteristic timescale for the system .",
    "this is an example of how one can utilize the flexibility in choosing the kinetic term in qa to formulate faster algorithms .",
    "this also indicates how the knowledge of the phase diagram of the system , the position of the quantum critical point in particular ( where the gap tends to vanish ) , helps in choosing additional kinetic terms and thus allows for the annealing paths that can avoid , to some extent , the regions of very low gap .",
    "qa is basically the analog version of quantum computation . like the conventional analog quantum computation ,",
    "the hardware realization of adiabatic quantum annealing is rather problem specific . but",
    "once realized , it follows the real - time schrdinger evolution , whose exact simulation is always intractable ( run time grows exponentially with the system size ) for classical computers and often also even for digital quantum computers ( see nielsen and chuang 2000 ) .",
    "the annealing behavior with the real - time schrdinger evolution is hence an important issue and may show features distinctly different from any monte carlo annealing discussed so far .",
    "the first analog algorithm in this line was due to farhi and gutmann ( 1998 ) for solving grover s search problem .",
    "grover ( 1997 ) showed that quantum mechanical search can reduce an @xmath203 classical search time to @xmath204 time in finding out a marked item form an unstructured data - base . in the analog version ,",
    "the problem was to use quantum evolution to find a given marked state among @xmath0 orthonormal states .",
    "the algorithm was formulated in the following way .",
    "there were @xmath0 mutually orthogonal normalized states , the @xmath62-th state being denoted by @xmath205 . among all of them , only one , say , the @xmath206-th one , has energy @xmath207 and the rest all have zero energy .",
    "thus the state @xmath208 is `` marked '' energetically and the system can distinguish it thus . now the question is how fast the system can evolve under a certain hamiltonian ( our oracle ) so that starting from an equal superposition of the @xmath0 states one reaches @xmath208 .",
    "it was shown ( farhi and gutmann 1998 ) that by evolving the system under a time - independent hamiltonian of the form @xmath209 where @xmath210 no improvement over grover s @xmath211 speedup is possible .",
    "later the problem was recast in the form of a spatial search ( childs and goldstone 2004 ) , where there is a @xmath89-dimensional lattice and the basis state @xmath205 is localized at the @xmath62-th lattice site .",
    "similarly , as before , the on - site potential energy @xmath212 is zero everywhere except at @xmath208 , where it is 1 .",
    "the objective is to reach the marked state starting from the equal superposition of all the @xmath205s .",
    "the kinetic term is formulated through the laplacian of the lattice , which effectively introduces uniform hopping to all nearest neighbors from any given lattice site and is kept constant .",
    "the model is in essence an anderson model ( santoro and tosatti , 2006 ) with only a single - site disorder of strength @xmath213 .",
    "grover s speed up can be achieved for @xmath214 with such a hamiltonian and no further betterment is possible .",
    "the algorithms succeeds only near the critical value of the kinetic term ( i.e. , at the quantum phase transition point ) .",
    "an adiabatic quantum evolution algorithm for grover search was formulated in terms of an orthonormal complete set of @xmath215-bit ising - like basis vectors , where the potential energy of a given basis vector ( among the @xmath216 ones ) is 1 , and for rest of all , it is 0 .",
    "the kinetic term is just the sum of all single bit - flip terms ( as the transverse - field term in eq .",
    "( [ sk - q ] ) ) .",
    "it connects each basis vector to all those that can be reached from it by a single bit flip .",
    "the kinetic term is reduced from a high value to zero following a linear schedule . a detailed analysis in light of the adiabatic theorem showed that one can not even retrieve grover s speedup sticking to the global adiabatic condition with fixed evolution rate as given by eq .",
    "( [ adia - cond ] ) .",
    "this is so because the minimum value of the gap goes as @xmath217 ( farhi et al 2000 ) , and the spin - flip kinetic term being local , the numerator @xmath218 of the adiabatic factor ( see eq .",
    "( [ adia - cond ] ) ) is at best @xmath219 however , the grover s speedup can be recovered if the condition of adiabaticity is maintained locally at every instant of the evolution and the rate is accelerated accordingly whenever possible ( roland and cerf , 2001 ) .",
    "adiabatic qa following real - time schrdinger evolution for satisfiability problems also gives strikingly different result ( for smaller system - size , though ) compared to that obtained using pimc - qa .",
    "adiabatic qa of an np - complete problem , namely , the exact cover problem ( as described below ) is studied for small systems , where a quadratic system - size dependence was observed ( farhi et al 2001 ) . in this problem also , the basis vectors are the complete set of @xmath216 orthonormal @xmath215-bit basis vectors , denoted by @xmath220 , each @xmath221 is either 0 or 1 .",
    "the problem consists of a cost function @xmath137 which is the sum of many 3-bit clause functions @xmath222 , each acting on arbitrarily chosen bits @xmath223 and @xmath224 .",
    "the clause function is such that @xmath225 if the clause @xmath226 is satisfied by the states @xmath227 , @xmath228 and @xmath229 of the three bits , or else @xmath230 .",
    "the cost hamiltonian is given by @xmath231 .",
    "thus if a basis state @xmath232 dissatisfies @xmath31 clauses , then @xmath233 .",
    "the question is whether there exists a basis vector that satisfies all the clauses for a given @xmath144 .",
    "there may be many basis vectors satisfying a clause .",
    "all of them will be the ground state of @xmath234 with zero eigenvalue .",
    "if the ground state has a non - zero ( must be a positive integer then ) eigenvalue , then it represents the basis with lowest number of violated clauses , the number being given by the eigenvalue itself .",
    "the total hamiltonian is given by @xmath235 where @xmath143 is again the sum of all the single bit - flip operators .",
    "the initial state at @xmath236 is taken to be the ground state of @xmath143 , which is an equal superposition of all basis vectors .",
    "the system is then evolved according to the time - dependent schrdinger equation up to @xmath237 .",
    "the value of @xmath134 required to achieve a pre - assigned success probability are noted for different system sizes .",
    "the result showed a smooth quadratic system size dependence for @xmath238 ( farhi et al 2001 ) .",
    "the result is quite encouraging ( since it seems to give a polynomial time solution for an np - complete problem for small system size ) , but does not really assure a quadratic behavior in the asymptotic ( @xmath239 ) limit .    a quadratic relaxation behavior ( @xmath240 , @xmath241 ) was also reported in ( suzuki and okada 2005a , 2005b ) for real - time adiabatic qa ( employing exact method for small systems and dmrg technique for larger systems ) of a one - dimensional tight - bonding model with random site energies and also for a random field ising model on 2-d square lattice . in the first case , the kinetic term was due to hopping between nearest neighbors , while in the second case it was simply the sum of single - spin flip operators as given in eq .",
    "( [ sk - q ] ) . wave function",
    "annealing results using similar dmrg technique for spin glass on ladder has been reported by rodriguez - laguna ( 2007 ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated that for finite - ranged systems , where the interaction energy can be written as a sum of interaction energies involving few variables , quantum adiabatic annealing and thermal annealing may not differ much in efficiency .",
    "however , for problems with spiky ( very high but narrow ) barriers in the pel ( which must include infinite - range terms in the hamiltonian , since in finite - range systems , barrier heights can grow at best linearly with barrier width ) , quantum annealing does much better than ca ( farhi and goldstone 2002 ) as has been argued by ray et al ( ray et al 1989 ) .",
    "quantum adiabatic evolution has been employed earlier to study the sk spin glass in a transverse field ; stationary characteristics over a range of the transverse field are calculated by varying the transverse field adiabatically ( lancaster and ritort 1997 ) .    as pointed out earlier in the case of pimc - qa",
    ", the kinetic term plays a crucial role in adiabatic qa also .",
    "this is mainly because the gap @xmath242 between the ground state and first excited state depends on the form of @xmath143 . for certain choice of @xmath143",
    ", it might become very small for some @xmath106 .",
    "one then can switch on some additional kinetic term ( adjusted by another parameter @xmath243 ) to increase the dimensionality of the phase diagram and avoid the small gap zone by taking a suitable by - pass .",
    "in fact such a strategy can convert a failure into success ( farhi et al 2002 ) .",
    "so far it has been argued that the advantage of quantum annealing derives mainly from the fact that quantum tunneling can penetrate through very high but narrow barriers , which are very hard to jump over thermally . in this way the cost - configuration landscapes more accessible to local moves .",
    "this is a key feature that works even in the case of quantum monte carlo methods like pimc - qa , where one finally samples only a very small section of the configuration space .",
    "however , another remarkable advantage that quantum mechanics provides is the ability to `` sense '' the whole configuration space simultaneously through a delocalized wave function .",
    "this sensing is largely handicapped by presence of random disorder in the system , because the wave function tends to localize in many places , often being unable to to pick up the deepest well very distinctly . but this feature may be utilized in searching a golf - course - like pel , namely a flat landscape with very deep and narrow wells occurring very rarely . if there is only one deep well , the problem is just the spatial version of the grover s problem . as we have seen , if the depth @xmath244 of the well is @xmath213 ( independent of @xmath0 ) , then no more than @xmath204 speed - up can be achieved .",
    "this can be interpreted as the inability of an exceedingly large system to sense a given small wound .",
    "so one might want to make the depth of the well large enough so that it can not be scaled away as the system - size is increased .",
    "we first consider the case where the well - depth goes as @xmath245 , where @xmath246 is some constant .",
    "for a well depth of such order for a spatial search at infinite dimension ( kinetic term is infinite - ranged ) one gets a stunning result : the evolution time that guarantees any given probability of success becomes independent of @xmath0 ( das 2007 ; see fig .",
    "[ qan ] ) .",
    "however , if @xmath244 scales like @xmath247 , with @xmath248 , then the speed - up is lost again - a consequence of quantum - mechanical non - adiabaticity .",
    "we formulate the problem in the following way . as in the case of a spatial search",
    "discussed above , we denote the state localized at the @xmath62-th cite by @xmath205 . all the cites except @xmath208 has zero on - site potential energy , while @xmath208 have an on - site potential well of depth @xmath249 . the system is embedded in infinite dimensions and thus there is a uniform tunneling term @xmath106 between any two sites . to do quantum annealing",

    "the total hamiltonian is given by @xmath251    the time - dependent eigen problem can be solved for the above hamiltonian . it can be shown exactly that if @xmath252 , then in the @xmath46 limit , the adiabatic factor @xmath253 which means that the run time becomes independent of @xmath0 , and the ground state has @xmath213 overlap with the target state @xmath208 .",
    "we also confirm it numerically by evaluating @xmath254 , which is the minimal @xmath134 required for obtaining a success probability @xmath255 for different @xmath0 through many decades . here",

    "the results are worse , as shown in fig .",

    "the adiabatic theorem of quantum annealing assures convergence of a quantum algorithm when one starts with the initial ( trivial ) ground state of the hamiltonian and evolves slowly enough so that the system is always in the ground state of the instantaneous hamiltonian .",
    "however , the benefit of tunneling may be extended even in cases where one does not precisely know the eigenstate of the initial hamiltonian ( say for a given unknown pel ) and hence is unable to start with it .",
    "one might rather start with a wave - packet ( a superposition of many eigenstates of the hamiltonian ) that explores the potential energy landscape .",
    "quantum tunneling will still allow it to move more easily through the pel than a classical particle if the landscape has many high but narrow barriers .",
    "a semi - classical treatment of such a non - stationary annealing has been discussed in the context of a kinetically constrained system ( kcs ) ( das et al 2005 ) .",
    "we demonstrate here the effectiveness of quantum annealing in the context of a certain generalized kinetically constrained systems ( kcs ) ( fredrickson and andersen et al 1984 ) .",
    "kcss are simple model systems having trivial ground state structures and static properties , but a complex relaxation behavior due to some explicit constraints introduced in the dynamics of the system .",
    "these systems are very important in understanding how much of the slow and complex relaxation behavior of a glass can be attributed to its constrained dynamics alone , leaving aside any complexity of its energy landscape structure . in kcss",
    "one can view the constraints to be represented by infinitely high energy barriers appearing dynamically .",
    "we discuss quantum annealing in the context of a kcs , which can be represented by a generalized version of the east model ( jackle and eisinger 1991 ) ; a one dimensional kcs .",
    "we also compare the results with that of thermal annealing done in the same system .",
    "the original east model is basically a one - dimensional chain of non - interacting classical ising ( ` up - down ' ) spins in a longitudinal field @xmath259 , say , in downward direction .",
    "the ground state of such a system is , trivially , all spins down .",
    "a kinetic constraint is introduced in the model by putting the restriction that the @xmath62-th spin can not flip if the @xmath260-th spin is down .",
    "such a kinetic constraint essentially changes the topology of the configuration space , since the shortest path between any two configurations differing by one or more forbidden flips is increased in a complicated manner owing to the blockage of the ` straight ' path consisting of direct flips of the dissimilar spins .",
    "further , the constraint becomes more limiting as more spins turn down , as happens in the late approach to equilibrium . as a result",
    ", the relaxation processes have to follow more complex and lengthier paths , giving rise to exponentially large timescale ( @xmath261 ; jackle and eisinger 1991 ) .    in the das model ( das et al 2005 )",
    "there is a chain of asymmetric double - wells ( each with infinite boundary walls ) , each having a particle localized within them .",
    "the asymmetry is due to an energy difference of @xmath262 between the two wells of a double well . the particle in one of the two ( asymmetric ) wells can change its location to the other well stochastically , either due to the thermal fluctuations or the quantum fluctuations present in the system .",
    "the generalized kinetic constraint is introduced by assuming that if the particle in the ( @xmath263)-th double - well resides in the lower one of the two wells , then there appears a barrier of height @xmath244 and width @xmath264 between the two wells of the @xmath62-th double - well . in such a situation",
    "the particle in the @xmath62-th double - well has to cross the barrier in order to change its location from one well to the other . on the other hand ,",
    "if the particle of the @xmath260-th is in its upper well , there is no such barrier to cross for the particle to go from one well to the other . following the approximate mapping done in case of a symmetric double - well ( chakrabarti et al 1996 )",

    "this kinetic constraint is the same in both cases irrespective of whether the dynamics is classical or quantum .",
    "when the dynamics of the particle is due to quantum fluctuations , the tunneling probabilities come from the following semi - classical picture of scattering of a particle in a double - well with infinitely remote outer boundaries . if a particle is put in one of the wells of such a double - well with some kinetic energy ( actually the expectation value ) @xmath106 , then it will eventually be scattered by the separator ( a barrier or step ) between the two wells .",

    "instead of annealing , one can quench a systems by reducing the transverse field from @xmath304 to @xmath305 and follow the relaxation dynamics after that . here",
    "@xmath306 denotes the quantum critical point for the system .",
    "this can help to prepare a state of the system with substantial order in a very short time .",
    "recently , quantum quenching dynamics in different systems , in particular for sudden quenching across a quantum critical point , have been studied extensively ( sengupta et al 2005 , calabrese and cardy 2006 , das et al 2006 ) .",
    "the ( exact ) results for the after - quench dynamics , following a sudden quench of an infinite - range ising model in transverse field ( das et al 2006 , see appendix 2 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ semi - classical ] .",
    "the results indicate that for a purely quantum system ( small @xmath307 ) , one might reach a non - stationary oscillatory state with a substantial value for the long - time average ( over the largest timescale ) of the order @xmath308 if the quenching is done from @xmath309 to @xmath310 thus one gets a state ( though non - stationary ) which has considerable order , in just one step quenching . however , if the quenching is carried out with a high but finite rate , one ends up reaching an excited state with topological defects ( see kibble 1976 , zurek 1985 , sengupta et al 2008 ) .",
    "unlike the gate - based quantum computers ( see , e.g. , ekert and jozsa 1996 , nielsen and chuang 2000 , galindo and martin - delgado 2002 ) , the annealing of a physical system towards the optimal state ( encoded in the ground state of the final hamiltonian ) in the classical limit naturally achieves analog quantum computation . as discussed here , the utilization of the quantum mechanical tunneling through the classically localized states in annealing of glasses has opened up this new paradigm for analog quantum computation of hard optimization problems through adiabatic reduction of the quantum fluctuations .",
    "we reviewed here the recent success in annealing , or optimizing the cost functions of complex systems , utilizing quantum fluctuations rather than the thermal fluctuations ( see santoro and tosatti 2006 for a more technical review ) .",
    "as mentioned already , following the early indication in ray et al ( 1989 ) and the pioneering demonstrations , theoretically by amara et al ( 1993 ) , finnila et al ( 1994 ) , kadowaki and nishimori ( 1998 ) , farhi et al ( 2001 ) and santoro et al ( 2002 ) , and experimentally by brooke et al ( 1999 ) , the quantum annealing technique has now emerged as a successful technique for optimization of complex cost functions .",
    "the literature , exploring its success and also its limitations , is also considerably developed at present .",
    "these are introduced here through discussions of the mapping of such hard problems to classical spin glass problems , discussions on quantum spin glasses , and consequent annealing .",
    "the physics of classical spin glasses ( see sec .",
    "ii ) offers us the knowledge of the of the energy or the thermodynamic potentials and their landscape structures .",
    "mapping of computationally hard problems like the tsp etc problems to their corresponding classical spin glass models also helped understanding their complexity ( sec .",
    "the timescale for tunneling through an energy barrier quantum mechanically , involves not only the height of the barrier , but also its width ; the narrower the barrier , the faster the tunneling ( for constant height ) .",
    "thermal fluctuations , on the other hand , see only the barrier height for crossing it .",
    "this reduction of tunneling time with the barrier width helps relaxing a quantum system much faster in some cases .",
    "this leads to the quantum annealin , a framework for constructing general heuristics to find approximate solutions of hard optimization problems . while simulated annealing employs the strategy of slow cooling , physical or in simulations , to find the ground state of glassy systems , quantum annealing employs quantum fluctuations ( see sec .",
    "iii ) . as mentioned before , this effectively reduces planck s constant to zero to reach the classically optimized ( minimum cost ) state .",
    "this reduction , when done completely adiabatically , guarantees that the system will be found in the ground state of the classical glass at the end ( provided there is no crossing of energy levels with the ground state in the course of evolution , and one has started initially with the ground state of the hamiltonian ) .",
    "this has already been realized experimentally ( see sec .",
    "iiid ) , where faster relaxation towards the ground state is achieved by reducing the external field ( inducing changes in the tunneling field ) , rather than by reducing the temperature . in this way analog quantum computation is realized through a novel route .",
    "recently an equivalence between the adiabatic qa and standard gate - based quantum computation has also been establised ( aharonov et al 2007 , mizel et al 2007 ) .",
    "we are grateful to a. chakrabarti , p. ray , d. sen , k. sengupta and r. b. stinchcombe for their collaborations at different stages of this work .",
    "we acknowledge g. aeppli , a. dutta , h. nishimori , g. santoro , p. sen and e. tosatti for useful discussions .",

    "the hamiltonian represents a system of spins in a ( @xmath89 + 1)-dimensional lattice , because of the appearance of one extra label @xmath126 for each spin variable .",
    "thus corresponding to each single quantum spin variable @xmath10 in the original hamiltonian we have an array of @xmath122 number of classical replica spins @xmath329 .",
    "this new ( time - like ) dimension along which these classical spins are spaced is known as trotter dimension .",
    "let us consider a system of spin-@xmath330 objects governed by the hamiltonian @xmath331 it can easily be rewritten as @xmath332 where @xmath333 , @xmath334 and a constant @xmath335 from @xmath155 in ( [ q - qnch - ham-2 ] ) .",
    "the above hamiltonian can again be cast into the simplified form @xmath336 where @xmath337 , giving the mean field ( exact in this long - range limit ) equation @xmath338 at @xmath301 and @xmath339 , @xmath340 denote unit vectors along @xmath112 and @xmath113 directions respectively .",
    "this gives @xmath341 for @xmath342 and @xmath343 for @xmath344 since the model is infinite - ranged one , the mean field approximation becomes exact and one can readily express @xmath345 in terms of its polar components as @xmath346 , @xmath307 being the total angular momentum .",
    "one can immediately utilize the classical equation of motion @xmath347 considering the above equation for the @xmath112 and @xmath113 components , we get @xmath348 here we have @xmath349 .",
    "if the system is now quenched from above its quantum critical point @xmath350 finally to a @xmath351 then one can write ( see das et al 2006 ) , equating the energies of the states with and without any order respectively , @xmath352 using this , one gets from eq .",
