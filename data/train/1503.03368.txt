    "afterglow theory predicts that synchrotron flux at frequencies larger than @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath6 is the cooling frequency and @xmath7 is the typical synchrotron frequency ) is determined mostly by the kinetic energy of the blast wave ( @xmath8 ) and the fraction of energy in shock - accelerated electrons ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "importantly , this flux does not depend on the grb environment and it depends very weakly on the fraction of energy in the magnetic field , @xmath3 and the power law index of the electrons energy distribution , @xmath10 ( @xcite or , more recently , @xcite ) . for @xmath10 ranging from 2.1 to 2.5 the predicted flux changes by a factor of order unity . assuming a typical @xmath11 one can derive an estimate of the kinetic energy of the blast - wave from afterglow observations at frequencies above @xmath6 . comparing this energy with the energy radiated at the prompt phase ( @xmath12 ) , yields an estimate of the prompt efficiency : @xmath13 .",
    "this method has been often applied to pre - swift x - ray observations at @xmath14day to estimate the kinetic energy of grbs .",
    "it suggested that the efficiency of the prompt phase of grbs should be : @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the x - ray plateaus in many of the swift grbs , led to an increase in the severity of the efficiency problem .",
    "the x - ray flux at the beginning of the plateau phase ( around 500 sec ) is lower by @xmath16 as compared with the same flux estimated by extrapolating backwards in time the observations at @xmath17day and therefore leads to an estimate of the kinetic energy lower by the same factor and to efficiencies of up to 0.9 @xcite .",
    "such high efficiencies pose an immense theoretical difficulty for prompt emission models .",
    "this efficiency includes two distinct processes , the conversion efficiency of bulk to internal energy , i.e. the efficiency of the energy dissipation process , and the conversion efficiency from internal energy to radiation .",
    "therefore , a high overall efficiency implies high efficiencies for both processes , which is not at all trivial .",
    "a crucial point in this analysis is the assumption that at around @xmath18day the x - ray band is above the cooling frequency and that the flux at this frequency is not affected by ssc losses , as was pointed out by @xcite .",
    "we examine here whether the x - ray flux is indeed a good proxy for the kinetic energy .",
    "to do so , we need to pin down the location of @xmath6 at late times , assess the role of ssc cooling , and re - derive the efficiency in case the basic assumptions ( i.e. , negligible compton cooling and @xmath19 at the time of observation ) are not valid . as the position of @xmath6 and the compton parameter , depend on @xmath3 and @xmath20",
    "this will require us to self - consistently determine these parameters . to do this , we collect lat , x - ray and optical data ( when available ) for a sample of lat grbs .",
    "we assume that lat photons are produced by external shocks ( via synchrotron or ssc ) and find ( both analytically and numerically ) self - consistent solutions for the given set of observations .",
    "we have collected a sample of grbs detected both by fermi - lat and by swift - xrt .",
    "since we are interested in cases in which both the lat and the xrt emissions are most likely afterglow radiation from external shocks , we included in our sample only those bursts for which the lat emission lasted longer than the prompt phase .",
    "we also consider optical observations , when available .",
    "the final sample includes nine grbs : 080916c , 090323 , 090328 , 090510 , 090926a , 100414a , 110625a , 110731a and 130427a .",
    "our basic assumption is that lat photons are produced by synchrotron emission from the forward shock . in this case",
    "we can calculate the kinetic energy of the blast wave both from x - ray and lat data by inverting the equation @xmath21 .",
    "we find that the kinetic energies inferred from the lat flux are on average @xmath22 times larger than those derived from x - rays . in turn , the efficiency derived from lat is much smaller ( 0.15 on average as opposed to 0.87 obtained from x - rays )",
    ".    there could be two solutions to the apparent discrepancy between the energies derived from lat and x - rays .",
    "first , the x - ray flux could be suppressed due to ic losses .",
    "if compton losses are important , than a factor @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is the compton parameter ) should be added to the equation for the flux above the cooling frequency : @xmath25 , and therefore @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the compton parameter for x - ray radiating electrons and @xmath28 is that of electrons radiating at the lat band ) . since lat photons are typically above the klein - nishina ( kn ) frequency , ic scattering of these photons is highly suppressed , and as a result @xmath29 .",
    "however , x - ray emitting electrons are not in the kn regime therefore their ssc losses can explain the discrepancy in flux .",
    "we refer to this possibility as  ssc - suppression \" .",
    "a second possibility is that the x - ray band is actually below the cooling frequency . in this spectral regime",
    "the flux depends strongly also on @xmath3 and on the external density .",
    "we refer to this possibility as  slow cooling \" scenario . in both cases",
    "the x - ray flux is no longer a good proxy for the energy .",
    "if one of the two scenarios can account for the data , then the kinetic energy estimated by the lat flux is a better estimate of the kinetic energies .",
    "we turn now to a general numerical solution , assuming only that both the x - ray and lat photons are produced by the same external shock .",
    "we relax the simplifying assumptions made above . ] , such as the assumption that the cooling frequency is below the lat band at the time of lat observations or even that the lat and x - ray fluxes are dominated by synchrotron and not ssc . for each burst , we run over all possible values of @xmath30 and change @xmath10 in the range : 2.1 to 2.8 . for each set of values we use @xcite to calculate the compton parameter @xmath31 , including possible corrections due to kn effects , and estimate the synchrotron sed ( using @xcite with the addition of the effect of ssc suppression ) and the ic sed ( using @xcite ) .",
    "we then calculate the fluxes at : @xmath32 ( the latter is the time of optical observations , in case such observations are available ) at @xmath0mev , kev , ev respectively .",
    "we compare these fluxes with the observed values , and in case the difference is within the reported uncertainty of the observations and the accuracy of the model ( which we estimate to be up to @xmath33 ) , we accept the solution .",
    "we find a good agreement between the numerical calculations and the simplified analysis outlined above .",
    "a typical example of allowed parameters space for grb 110731a in an ism environment can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:110731a ] .",
    "three types of solutions can be seen in this figure . the lower branch ( lower densities , below the dot - dashed line ) branch consists of solutions where x - rays are synchrotron radiation from slow cooling electrons , whereas the lat flux is produced by synchrotron fast cooling electrons .",
    "this is the slow cooling case in  [ efficiency ] .",
    "the intermediate branch ( between the dot - dashed and the dashed line ) , consists of solutions where both x - rays and lat are dominated by fast cooling synchrotron , but the x - ray emitting electrons are suppressed by ssc .",
    "this corresponds to the ssc suppressed case discussed in  [ efficiency ] .",
    "the uppermost branch of solutions ( above the dashed line ) , consists of cases where the x - rays are still produced by synchrotron from ssc - suppressed fast cooling electrons , but the lat photons are dominated by the ssc component instead of synchrotron . in this case",
    "the spectral slope of @xmath34 in lat is rising ( @xmath35 ) and is therefore in contradiction with lat observations , ruling out this possibility both allowed solutions suggest that the prompt efficiency is moderate : @xmath36 , corresponding to isotropic equivalent kinetic energies satisfying : @xmath37erg .",
    "in addition , the allowed parameter space results in upper limits on the magnetization : @xmath38 .    typical seds of the `` slow cooling '' and `` ssc suppressed '' solutions , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:110731a ] can be seen in fig .",

    "the lower branch ( below the dot - dashed line ) corresponds to the  slow cooling \" solutions .",
    "solutions above this line correspond to  ssc suppressed \" solutions .",
    "the uppermost branch ( in the upper left corner , above the dashed line ) corresponds to situations in which x - rays are synchrotron from ssc - suppressed fast cooling electrons and the lat is dominated by ssc photons .",
    "however these solutions are ruled out by more detailed modeling of the spectrum . for reasonable values of @xmath39",

    "we have examined a sample of grbs with both lat and x - ray afterglow data .",
    "our basic assumption is that lat photons ( or at least the late tail of these photons ) are produced by synchrotron emission from the forward shock .",
    "we find that the x - ray flux is not a good proxy for the kinetic energy of the blast wave , either because the x - ray emitting electrons are slow cooling or because the x - ray flux is suppressed by ssc losses .",
    "the lat flux , is not prone to these problems and is therefore a better proxy of the energy .",
    "the derived prompt efficiencies using lat photons are considerably lower as compared with efficiency estimates using the x - rays ( 15@xmath5 as opposed to 87@xmath5 and higher ) .",
    "these afterglow models require small values of @xmath3 : @xmath2 .",
    "such low values would arise if either there is no extra amplification of the external magnetic field beyond shock compression ( see @xcite ) or if strong magnetic fields are created by micro - turbulence near the shock , but then these fields decay rapidly with the distance from the shock front @xcite and the bulk of the afterglow emission is produced in a low magnetic field region .",
