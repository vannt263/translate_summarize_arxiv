    "explicit cp violation can be introduced in quantum chromodynamics by the inclusion of the so - called theta term in the action . in euclidean space",
    "this amounts to @xmath7 a remarkable feature of such a term in the presence of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry is the dashen phenomenon @xcite : this explicit breaking of cp can become spontaneous due to vacuum doubling at the point @xmath3 .",
    "this value falls outside the physically relevant range @xmath8 to which @xmath0 is constrained by the neutron dipole moment @xcite and current algebra @xcite . nonetheless , the dashen phenomenon is a constraint on self - consistent models of the non - perturbative qcd vacuum .",
    "the statement of the problem related to the dashen phenomenon as well as the question about periodic dependence of observables in @xmath0 acquire full sense only if the values of @xmath5 are not restricted to integers . in this paper",
    "we use the domain model @xcite of the qcd vacuum to show how specific properties of quark field configurations summed up in the partition function can lead to the periodic dependence on @xmath0 and to the dashen phenomenon for any rational values of @xmath5 .",
    "the approaches which originally demonstrated the dashen phenomenon in the context of qcd are those of anomalous ward identities @xcite and effective chiral lagrangians @xcite in the limit of large number of colours @xmath6 , which we shall describe below in more detail .",
    "subsequent discussions of the dashen phenomenon include @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon for @xmath9 is intimately related to both the mechanism of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the non - appearance of an axial @xmath1 pseudoscalar goldstone boson as shown by the original works revealing it in qcd . in @xcite",
    "the key tool is the generalisation to the axial @xmath1 channel of ward identities in which the true vacuum of the theory is unknown , but for which divergences of current - current expectation values in this vacuum can be related to hadron spectroscopy via vacuum symmetry properties .",
    "for example , the light pion mass as input into the flavour @xmath10 ward identity ( which gives the gell - mann  oakes  renner relation ) leads to a non - zero chiral condensate as the output . in the axial @xmath1 channel ( where the anomaly figures ) and @xmath11 the phenomenological input is now the absence of a light meson , with the output that topological charge @xmath5 must be fractional .",
    "with @xmath12 the corresponding output starting with the same phenomenological input is @xmath2-periodicity in @xmath0 and the property of vacuum doubling and spontaneous cp breaking at @xmath3 . in the large @xmath6 approach the same data is turned around .",
    "an effective lagrangian for mesons is written down for @xmath13 which assumes chiral symmetry breaking and the anomaly .",
    "the output for @xmath11 includes the famous relation between the topological susceptibility and various meson masses . for @xmath12",
    "again the dashen phenomenon emerges .",
    "however these approaches do not unveil the actual mechanism of non - perturbative vacuum properties such as confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the domain model @xcite is a bottom up approach to these features : a particular vacuum structure is introduced into the formalism explicitly , here based on a statistical ensemble of domain - like gluon fields , and out of this both vacuum and mesonic properties are derived . in previous works both confinement @xcite and chiral symmetry realisation @xcite have been studied for this vacuum _",
    "ansatz_. the anomaly contribution to the free energy suppresses continuous axial @xmath1 degeneracy in the ground state , leaving only a discrete residual axial symmetry . this discrete symmetry and flavour @xmath14 chiral symmetry in turn",
    "are spontaneously broken with a quark condensate arising due to the asymmetry of the spectrum of dirac operator in the domain background .",
    "an estimate of pseudoscalar and vector meson masses has been computed showing the typical pattern of spontaneous breakdown of @xmath14 chiral symmetry with the correct splitting between @xmath15 and @xmath16 mesons @xcite . in this paper",
    "we test the model against the above predictions of spontaneous cp breaking and generally explore its features for non - zero @xmath0 parameter .",
    "the dashen phenomenon is studied by directly computing the @xmath0-dependendence of the free energy density and chiral condensate within the domain model .",
    "the results of this paper are that indeed the vacuum doubling at @xmath3 occurs in the domain model for any rational values of the topological charge @xmath5 and any number of flavours .",
    "thus the domain model provides an explicit example of simultaneous realisation of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking where the dashen phenomenon is manifest . within the model ,",
    "the topological charge is not restricted to any _ ad hoc _ value , and in the general case there are critical values in addition to @xmath3 , which disappear when @xmath5 is set to @xmath17 ( which is the value of @xmath5 emerging in @xcite for the case of @xmath18 degenerate quark flavours ) . in particular , in @xcite the domain model parameters were fixed from the string tension giving @xmath19 . for this topological charge , the critical values @xmath20 appear for which the vacuum doubling occur .",
    "as with @xcite , vacuum degeneracy for discrete @xmath0 and @xmath2-periodicity of observables such as the condensate arises as output rather than being assumed . unlike @xcite , these results emerge without the absence of a massless @xmath1 boson being input .",
    "we first briefly review the domain model for @xmath11 and thereafter examine the realisation of chiral symmetry for @xmath12 . in the appendices we review and compare our results with the approaches of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for motivation and a detailed description of the domain model we refer the reader to @xcite . the essential definition of the model is given in terms of the following partition function for @xmath21 domains of radius @xmath22 @xmath23 \\delta_{\\rm fp}[\\breve{\\cal b}^{(i)},q^{(i ) } ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times e^ { - s_{v_i}^{\\rm qcd } \\left[q^{(i)}+{\\cal b}^{(i ) } , \\psi^{(i)},\\bar\\psi^{(i ) } \\right ] } \\label{partf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the functional spaces of integration @xmath24 and @xmath25 are specified by the boundary conditions @xmath26 @xmath27 here @xmath28 with the generators @xmath29 of @xmath30 in the adjoint representation and @xmath31 is a random chiral angle associated with the chiral symmetry violating boundary condition eq.([quarkbc ] ) in the presence of one species of quark .",
    "the generalisation to @xmath18 flavours is given in the next section .",
    "the thermodynamic limit assumes @xmath32 but with the density @xmath33 taken fixed and finite .",
    "the partition function is formulated in a background field gauge with respect to the domain mean field , which is approximated inside and on the boundaries of the domains by a covariantly constant ( anti-)self - dual gluon field with the field - strength tensor of the form @xmath34 with @xmath35 . here",
    "@xmath36 are the positions of the centres of domains in euclidean space .    in order to reflect continuity of colorless quark currents at the positions of pure gauge singularities in the picture of quark and gluon configurations , which is approximated by the domain model , the chiral angle @xmath31 is taken to be the same for all domains in the representation eq .",

    "this is a refinement of the formulation presented in @xcite .",
    "the measure of integration over parameters characterising domains is @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the spherical angles of the chromomagnetic field , @xmath39 is the angle between chromoelectric and chromomagnetic fields and @xmath40 is an angle parametrising the colour orientation .",
    "this partition function describes a statistical system of domain - like structures of density @xmath41 , where the volume of a domain is @xmath42 .",
    "each domain is characterised by a set of internal parameters and with internal dynamics represented by fluctuation gluon @xmath43 and quark @xmath44 fields .",
    "it respects the symmetries of the qcd lagrangian , since the statistical ensemble is invariant under space - time , colour gauge and particularly chiral symmetries .",
    "thus the model involves two free parameters : the mean field strength @xmath45 and the mean domain radius @xmath22 .",
    "these dimensionful parameters break the scale invariance present originally in the qcd lagrangian . in principle",
    ", they should be related to the trace anomaly of the energy - momentum tensor @xcite and , eventually , to the fundamental scale @xmath46 .",
    "knowledge of the full quantum effective action of qcd would be required for establishing a relation of this kind . within this framework the gluon condensate to lowest order in fluctuations is @xmath47 and the topological charge per domain is @xmath48 .",
    "an area law is obtained for static quarks .",

    "the solution to this problem reveals an asymmetric spectrum , exhibiting the broken chiral symmetry through the bag - like boundary condition , and thus none of the eigenmodes is chiral .",
    "however at the centre of domains all modes are chiral and the sign of their chirality depends on whether the underlying gauge field is self - dual or anti - self - dual . in @xcite",
    "we computed the distribution of values of the local chirality parameter of @xcite in a chirally symmetric ensemble revealing qualitatively similar behaviour to the double - peak structure seen on the lattice @xcite , which is taken to be indicative of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry .",
    "the @xmath31-dependent part of the free energy density was computed in @xcite using zeta function regularisation , with an imaginary part arising @xmath59 where @xmath5 is the absolute value of topological charge in a domain , and overall sign @xmath60 corresponds to an ( anti-)self - dual domain .",
    "the charge is not integer here in general but the anomalous term is nonetheless @xmath61 periodic in @xmath31 .",

    "the anomaly defines those chiral angles which minimise the free energy so that the full @xmath66 group is no longer reflected in the vacuum degeneracy .",

    "for @xmath4 quark flavours the fermion boundary condition in eq.([quarkbc ] ) , explicitly breaks all chiral symmetries , flavour singlet and non - singlet ( see also @xcite ) . thus integrating over all @xmath31 does not suffice to provide for the full chiral invariance of the ensemble of quark configurations contributing to the partition function .",

    "an effective lagrangian for @xmath209 with chiral and axial @xmath1 symmetry broken is @xmath212 where the first term is a kinetic term , the second a mass , and the third term is designed to only yield a term quadratic in the singlet field and is consistent with large @xmath6 counting rules .",

    "the aim is now to minimise the effective potential to find the vacuum configurations .",
    "this is aided by considering a diagonal @xmath209 parametrised as @xmath197 where the @xmath142 are complicated functions of the meson fields @xmath211 .",

    "the last term incorporates only information about the overall phase of @xmath209 ; the corresponding expansion to second order in @xmath211 will reflect the mass of the singlet @xmath1 state . that this is taken to be large compared to the other @xmath81 is now input at this point .",
    "one now minimises with respect to the angles @xmath142 ( `` dashen s theorem '' ) giving @xmath222 evidently then one has again @xmath223 identical to eq.([dashentheorem ] ) . on the other hand , taking the first @xmath81 mesons to be light , the only way to minimise the potential for a heavy @xmath1 boson is to constrain the term with factor @xmath224 to be exactly zero , namely @xmath225 which is identical to the condition from anomalous ward identities - no surprise since the effective lagrangian is engineered to satisfy these identities .",
    "implementing these conditions leads to the identical dependence on @xmath0 discussed in the previous section , which now appears in the potential at its minima @xmath226 since the quark condensates reside in the @xmath216 an identical dependence on @xmath0 as that found using anomalous ward identities emerges .",
    "the dependence involves @xmath227 now because of the way the @xmath218field transforms under chiral transformations in terms of the @xmath0 parameter : @xmath228 and there is no relative factor of two between the sum of the phases of @xmath209 and @xmath0 .",
