    "it is now widely believed that the universe experienced an extremely rapid expanding phase , the inflation , in the early stage of its history , which is assumed to be driven by the vacuum energy of a scalar field , called inflaton .",
    "in addition that the inflaton gives an inflationary expanding era , it can also provide the source of primordial density fluctuations , whose nature can be utilized to differentiate inflationary models .",
    "specifically , the spectral index @xmath0 , describing the scale dependence of the primordial power spectrum , and the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath11 , characterizing the amplitude of the gravity waves , are usually discussed , which can be measured / constrained by cosmological observations such as cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , large scale structure and so on .",
    "in particular , in the near future , several experiments are expected to measure / constrain the tensor - to - scalar ratio with high sensitivity , which may enable us to grasp invaluable hints to understand the inflationary model realized in the nature .",
    "however , on the other hand , there exist inflation models which predict too small tensor - to - scalar ratio to be detected , at least , in near future experiments .",
    "furthermore , primordial density fluctuations are not necessarily generated from the inflaton , but they can be produced by a light scalar field other than the inflaton , such as in the curvaton model @xcite , modulated reheating scenario @xcite and so on . in particular , models of these kind have been attracting attention since they can predict large values of @xmath12 , a measure of bispectrum which characterizes non - gaussian nature of density fluctuations , current observations of cmb and large scale structure give the constraints on @xmath12 for the local type as @xmath13 from wmap9 @xcite and @xmath14 from nrao vla sky survey @xcite . ] . in these models ,",
    "the tensor - to - scalar ratio is generally very small , and thus one may not be able to detect any gravity wave signal if such a model is the correct one for generating density fluctuations .",
    "in such a case , we may need to pursue another quantity which is not related to the gravity waves .",
    "as such a quantity , the spectral index @xmath0 is widely discussed .",
    "however , there are many inflationary models which can predict almost the same value of @xmath0 , thus we need something more .    in light of these considerations , it would be desirable to have more observables , in particular , which are irrelevant to the tensor mode . needless to say , such a quantity would also be helpful even if we can have information from the gravity waves as well , and give complementary information .",
    "as such an observable , we consider the running of the spectral index , @xmath1 and even a higher order running or  the running of the running \" @xmath2 .",
    "the former quantity , @xmath1 , has already been explored by many authors .",
    "however , the latter one , @xmath2 , has not been investigated much in the literature , on which we especially focus in this paper . in general , higher order runnings are expected to be very small compared to the spectral index @xmath15 , thus it seems very difficult to actually measure such a quantity .",
    "however , as we will show in this paper , future experiments of 21 cm fluctuation can give precise measurements of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which would be very useful to differentiate inflationary models .",
    "in fact , the issue of probing the primordial power spectrum with 21 cm experiments was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we further extend the discussion including the running of the running @xmath2 and study its expected constraints from future observations of 21 cm fluctuations in combination with cmb .",
    "in addition to observational constraints , we also study the runnings @xmath1 and @xmath2 as well as @xmath0 in some explicit models and discuss its testability and in what cases the information from @xmath1 and @xmath2 will be useful to differentiate inflationary models .",
    "this paper is organized into four sections as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we give a formalism to discuss the power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations , paying particular attention to its scale dependence such as @xmath16 and @xmath2 .",
    "we also give the predictions for these variables in some explicit models and discuss in what models / cases the information of the runnings are useful . in section  [ sec : obs ] , we describe our method to derive expected constraints from future observations of 21 cm fluctuations and cmb and present out results .",
    "the final section is devoted to summary of this paper .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the purpose of this paper is to investigate what kind of information can be obtained by considering the scale dependence of primordial curvature perturbations including  higher order \" ones . before going to study expected constraints , here in this section , we give a formalism and formulas to discuss primordial curvature perturbations and its scale dependence .",
    "we also study some explicit inflationary models . since primordial curvature perturbation can also be generated from a light scalar field other than the inflaton such as in the curvaton , modulated reheating scenarios and so on , we give the formulas for such cases as well .",
    "but first we start with a case of the standard inflation model .      for the standard inflation case",
    ", the primordial curvature power spectrum is given , in terms of the @xmath17 formalism , by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the power spectrum for fluctuations of the inflaton field @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "for the standard inflation case , @xmath21 with a dot representing derivative with respect to time .",
    "the subscript ",
    "@xmath22 \" indicates that the quantity is evaluated at the time of horizon exit @xmath23 and @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the euler - mascheroni constant .",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 are slow - roll parameters which are defined as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the potential for the inflaton and a subscript @xmath20 represents a derivative with respect to the inflaton field . for later use , here",
    "we also define higher order slow - roll parameters : @xmath30 where we have put the superscripts @xmath31 and @xmath32 to remind that @xmath33 and @xmath34 are second and third order slow - roll quantities , respectively .",
    "we expand the power spectrum in terms of the logarithm of the wave number up to the 3rd order as @xmath35 \\notag \\\\ \\notag \\\\ & = &    { \\cal p}_{\\zeta } ( k_{\\rm ref } )    \\left ( \\frac{k}{k_{\\rm ref } }   \\right)^ {   n_s -1 + \\frac12 \\alpha_s   \\ln ( k /k_{\\rm ref } )   + \\frac16 \\beta_s   \\ln^2 ( k /k_{\\rm ref } )    } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath36 @xmath1 is usually called  running \" of @xmath0 .",
    "thus in this sense , @xmath2 may be called as  the running of the running . \"    by using the slow - roll parameters , @xmath16 and @xmath2 are written as @xmath37      when the primordial curvature perturbation originates to fluctuations of a light scalar field @xmath38 other than the inflaton , such as in the case of the curvaton and modulated reheating models , the expressions for the spectral index and its runnings are different from those in the standard inflation case . here we assume that the energy density of such a light scalar field is subdominant during inflation , and hence it does not affect the inflationary dynamics . to make our discussion general , we consider the case where the inflaton and a light scalar field can be both responsible for density perturbations .",
    "cases with the standard inflation or a light scalar field being purely responsible for density perturbations are given as limiting cases .    denoting a light field as @xmath38 and assuming that the inflaton and the @xmath38 field are uncorrelated , the total curvature perturbation can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively represent the contribution from the inflaton and @xmath38 fields .",
    "the inflaton part @xmath42 is actually the one given in eq .  .",
    "for the contribution from a light scalar field , @xmath41 is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the power spectrum for fluctuations of a light scalar field @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "here the slow - roll parameter @xmath45 for @xmath38 field is defined similarly to those for the inflaton case as @xmath46 where we assume that the scalar potential is given by the sum of those for @xmath20 and @xmath38 as @xmath47 . for later use , here",
    "we also define other higher order slow - roll parameters as @xmath48 where a subscript @xmath38 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath38 field .    the spectral index @xmath0 and its runnings @xmath49 and @xmath2 in this case are given as follows : @xmath50 \\notag   \\\\    & & + \\xi_\\sigma \\left [   -2 \\epsilon + 2 \\eta_\\sigma    + \\left ( - \\frac{22}{3 } + 8c \\right )   \\epsilon^2 + \\frac23 \\eta_{\\sigma}^2     + \\left ( \\frac83 - 4c \\right ) \\epsilon \\eta   +   \\left ( \\frac23 - 4c \\right ) \\epsilon \\eta_{\\sigma }      \\right .",

    "now we discuss some explicit models and their predictions for the spectral index @xmath0 and the runnings @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "to provide an example of in what cases the information from the runnings is useful , here we consider models with small tensor - to - scalar ratio , in other words , the information from the ( scalar - mode ) power spectrum only available .",
    "we will argue below that , in some cases ,  running of the running \" can be very useful to discriminate inflationary models . for descriptive purpose ,",
    "we consider three models and discuss their predictions on @xmath54 and @xmath2 .    model i : :    * : curvaton with quartic chaotic inflation model *    +    in this model , we assume that the curvaton field is totally    responsible for the cosmic density perturbations . however , even in the    curvaton model , the inflationary expansion is driven by the inflaton    field and we need to specify the inflation model , or the inflaton    potential , to compute the power spectrum . for the inflation model , we    adopt the chaotic inflation model with a quartic potential :    @xmath55 where @xmath56    is a coupling parameter .",
    "in fact , the quartic chaotic inflation is    already excluded by current cosmological observations @xcite when the    inflaton is completely responsible for density perturbations . however ,    when the curvaton generates primordial density fluctuations , it is    still viable , and even more worth mentioning , such an inflation model    is preferable for this case @xcite since it can give the    spectral index of @xmath57 , which is close to the    central value from observational constraints .",
    "we should also note here    that , although the curvaton model has been attracting attention    because it can generate large non - gaussianity , but it is not    necessarily large : the curvaton can also predict small values of    @xmath12 in some parameter range .",
    "thus ,    non - gaussianity may not give useful information in such a case even    for this type of model .",
    "+    for the curvaton sector , we assume that its mass is very small so that    we can set @xmath58 in the calculation of    @xmath0 and so on .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned above , the    curvaton is assumed to be totally responsible for the primordial power    spectrum , and hence we also set @xmath59 .",
    "to realize this situation , fluctuations from the inflaton    should satisfy @xmath60 ,    which means that the inflation scale is low and the tensor - to - scalar    ratio becomes very small .    +    in fig .",
