    "in recent years , attempts have been made  @xcite to draw a distinction between the thermodynamic limit as a ` mathematical tool ' of limited physical relevance , and the physical behavior of large , finite systems , the real - world objects of study . in this note",
    "we discuss why this distinction is spurious , and show through several examples that this ` tool ' is useful precisely _ for _ determining the behavior of large , finite systems .",
    "we will also discuss why this attempted distinction has caused confusion in the case of spin glasses , and how resolving it introduces some important new physics .",
    "for ease of discussion , we confine ourselves throughout to ising spin systems .",
    "one of the incongruities of the ` thermodynamic limit vs.  finite volume ' debate is that true thermodynamic states are in fact measures of the _ local _ properties of a macroscopic system , while discussions of finite - volume properties  at least in the context of infinite - range spin glasses  focus entirely on _ global _ quantities .",
    "of course , traditional thermodynamics ( as opposed to statistical mechanics ) is entirely a study of global properties of macroscopic systems .",
    "quantities like energy or magnetization are collective properties of _ all _ of the individual spins in a given finite- or infinite - volume configuration .",
    "other global measures can not be discussed in terms of individual spin configurations but rather are meaningful only in the context of a gibbs distribution ( also known as gibbs state or thermodynamic state  we will use these terms interchangably throughout ) .",
    "entropy is the obvious example of such a variable .",
    "all of these together  energy , entropy , magnetization , and the various free energies associated with them  convey only coarse information about a system ( though still extremely valuable ) .",
    "what they convey little information about is the actual spatial structure of a state , or of the relationships among different states .",
    "even a quantity like the staggered magnetization , which gives some information about spatial structure , does not shed significant light on local properties .",
    "but for real systems one often does want information about local properties . in order to analyze local spatial and temporal structures one generally needs to employ _ local thermodynamic variables _  for example , @xmath0point correlation functions .",
    "in fact , these functions taken altogether convey _ all _ of the information that can be known about that state in equilibrium  a gibbs state is a specification of all possible @xmath1-point ( spatial ) correlation functions , for every positive integer @xmath1 .",
    "alternatively , one can define a thermodynamic state either as a convergent sequence ( or subsequence ) of finite - volume states as volume tends to infinity , or else intrinsically through the dlr equations  @xcite .",
    "but we will avoid a technical discussion here in the interest of keeping the discussion focused on physical objects .",
    "we henceforth assume familiarity with concepts such as thermodynamic mixed state and thermodynamic pure state , which have been used extensively throughout much of the spin glass literature , and refer the reader who wishes to learn more to section 4 of  @xcite .",
    "are there any _ global _ quantities that say something about the spatial structure of a state ?",
    "the answer is yes , and one in particular has proven to be very useful in comparing different pure state structures in the infinite - range sherrington - kirkpatrick  ( sk ) model  @xcite of a spin glass .",
    "the sk hamiltonian ( in volume @xmath2 ) is @xmath3 where the couplings @xmath4 are independent , identically distributed random variables chosen , e.g. , from a gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance one ; the @xmath5 scaling ensures a sensible thermodynamic limit for free energy per spin and other thermodynamic quantities .    in a series of papers , parisi and collaborators  @xcite proposed , and worked out the consequences of , an extraordinary _ ansatz _ for the nature of the low - temperature phase of the sk model .",
    "following the mathematical procedures underlying the solution , it came to be known as _ replica symmetry breaking _ ( rsb ) .",
    "the starting point of the parisi solution was that the low - temperature spin glass phase comprised not just a single spin - reversed pair of states , but rather `` infinitely many pure thermodynamic states ''  @xcite , not related by any simple symmetry transformations .",
    "but how were they related ? to answer this question , parisi introduced a _ global _",
    "quantity  exactly of the sort we were just asking about  to quantify such relationships .",
    "the actual notion of pure ` state ' in the sk model is problematic , as discussed , e.g. , in  @xcite .",
    "we ll ignore that problem for now , though , and assume that somehow two sk pure states @xmath6 and @xmath7 have been defined .",
    "then their overlap @xmath8 is defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a thermal average in pure state @xmath6 , and dependence on @xmath11 and @xmath12 has been suppressed .",
    "so @xmath8 is a quantity measuring the similarity between states @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we noted above that quantities referring to individual pure states are problematic in the sk model , since there is no known procedure for constructing such states in a well - defined way .",
    "however , what is really of interest is the _ distribution _ of overlaps , which _ can _ be sensibly defined by using the finite-@xmath2 gibbs state .",
    "the overlap distribution is constructed by choosing , at fixed @xmath2 and @xmath12 , two of the many pure states present in the gibbs state .",
    "the probability that their overlap lies between @xmath13 and @xmath14 is then given by the quantity @xmath15 , where @xmath16 as before , we suppress the dependence on @xmath12 and @xmath2 for ease of notation .",
    "the average @xmath17 of @xmath18 over the disorder distribution is commonly referred to as the _ parisi overlap distribution _ , and serves as an order parameter for the sk model .    because there is no spatial structure in the infinite - range model ,",
    "the overlap function does seem to capture the essential relations among the different states .",
    "however , it might already be noticed that such a global quantity would miss important information in short - range models  assuming that such models also have many pure states . there is no information in @xmath18 about local correlations .",
    "this is acceptable , even desirable , in an infinite - range model such as sk which has no geometric structure , measure of distance , or notion of locality or neighbor .",
    "but all of these are well - defined objects in short - range models , and carry a great deal of information about any state , pair of states , or collection of many states .",
    "this is one of the sources of the difficulties one encounters ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) when attempting to apply conclusions to short - range spin glasses that were derived for the sk model .",
    "to illustrate some of these ideas in a simple context , consider the uniform nearest - neighbor ising ferromagnet on @xmath19 , with hamiltonian @xmath20    it is natural in models such as this to take periodic or free boundary conditions when considering the finite - volume gibbs state . in any fixed @xmath21 ,",
    "consider for @xmath22 a sequence of volumes @xmath23 ( for specificity , @xmath24 cubes centered at the origin ) tending to infinity with , for example , periodic b.c.s .",
    "the gibbs state  which , as emphasized in the preceding section , describes behavior of the local spin variables  converges in the infinite - volume limit to the symmetric mixture of a pure plus state with @xmath25 ( which , because of translation symmetry , is independent of @xmath26 ) and a pure minus state with @xmath27 . in a similar way",
    ", one could choose to study instead a global variable , say the magnetization per spin @xmath28 .",
    "it is easy to show that this variable has a distribution that converges in the limit to a symmetric mixture of @xmath29-functions at @xmath30 . in this case descriptions of the system in terms of both local and global variables",
    "are interesting , and more to the point , they agree .",
    "but even in the simple case of the uniform , nearest - neighbor ising ferromagnet this need not always be true . consider ` dobrushin boundary conditions '  @xcite . these are b.c.s in which the boundary spins above the ` equator ' ( a plane or hyperplane parallel to two opposing faces of @xmath23 and cutting it essentially in half by passing just above the origin ) are chosen to be plus and the boundary spins at and below the equator are minus .",
    "boundary conditions such as these are useful for studying interface structure in spin models .    now",
    "( below the roughening temperature ) translation - invariance is lost ( in one direction ) , and the local and global variables disagree .",
    "the gibbs state is one where @xmath31 for @xmath32 ( taking @xmath33 to be the equator ) and @xmath34 when @xmath35 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath36 will depend on the value of @xmath37 ( though it remains independent of the coordinates in all transverse directions ) .",
    "moreover for @xmath38 there is additional dimension - dependence of the behavior of the local variables ( related to the roughening transition ) which we will not discuss here .",
    "the magnetization global variable is no longer even interesting .",
    "its distribution converges to a @xmath29-function at 0 at all temperatures in all dimensions .",
    "it therefore conveys very little information about the nature of the state .",
    "one could instead choose a more appropriate global variable that better matches the boundary conditions , e.g. , an order parameter such as @xmath39 where @xmath40 if @xmath26 is above the equator and @xmath41 if below .",
    "one might also consider a sort of ` quasi - global ' variable , that looks at block magnetizations in blocks that are large compared to the unit lattice spacing but small compared to entire system size @xmath42 .",
    "one could then examine the ` spatial ' distribution of the block magnetization as the location of the block varies through the system . above @xmath43",
    "this is simply a @xmath29-function at zero , but below @xmath43 one gets a symmetric mixture of @xmath29-functions at @xmath44 for all @xmath45 .",
    "this is still not as sensitive as the actual gibbs state , which can distinguish between the rough and nonrough interfaces ( e.g. , below @xmath43 in @xmath46 compared to @xmath47 in @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the 3d roughening temperature ) by having a different expression for the limiting gibbs state in the two cases .",
    "in the case of spin glass models , we have found  @xcite a much sharper disparity between finite- and infinite - range models than is the case for any homogeneous statistical mechanical model of which we are aware .",
    "consider first the edwards - anderson ( ea ) nearest - nieghbor model  @xcite on @xmath19 .",
    "its hamiltonian in zero external field is given by @xmath50 where the nearest - neighbor couplings @xmath51 are defined in exactly the same way as the @xmath4 in the sk  hamiltonian  ( [ eq : sk ] ) .",
    "in this model thermodynamic pure , mixed , and ground states are standard , well - defined ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) objects , constructed according to well - established prescriptions of statistical mechanics  @xcite .",
    "local thermodynamic variables therefore convey in principle all of the essential information about any state .",
    "global variables such as parisi overlap functions can be defined for the ea model as well , but are now very prescription - dependent : for the same system , very different overlap functions can be obtained through use of different boundary conditions , or by changing the order of taking the thermodynamic limit and breaking the replica symmetry .",
    "because of this , they may not convey reliable information about the number of states or the relationships among them . for a detailed review of these issues and problems ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "turning to the sk model , we find that a unique situation arises .",
    "pure states are in principle defined for a fixed realization of _ all _ of the couplings ; but in the sk model the _ physical _ couplings @xmath52 scale to zero as @xmath53 . as a result , there does not now exist any known way of constructing thermodynamic pure states in an sk spin glass .",
    "it has been proposed  @xcite that one way of defining such objects is through the use of a modified ` clustering ' property : if @xmath54 denotes a putative pure state in the sk model , then one can demand it satisfy : @xmath55 for any fixed pair @xmath56 , in analogy with the clustering property obeyed by ` ordinary ' pure states in conventional statistical mechanics . at this time",
    "though , there exists no known operational way to construct such an @xmath6 as appears in  ( [ eq : modclustering ] ) . but even if such a construction were available , the definition of pure states through  ( [ eq : modclustering ] ) leads to bizarre conclusions in the sk model  ( see  @xcite ) .    are these problems simply a consequence of infinite - range interactions ?",
    "no , because they are absent in the curie - weiss model of the uniform ferromagnet .",
    "though physical couplings scale to zero there also , they `` reinforce '' each other , being nonrandom , so one may still talk about positive and negative magnetization states  in analogy with what one sees in finite - range models  in the @xmath53 limit ( of course , one can no longer talk of interface states ) .",
    "so the unique behavior of the sk model arises ( at the least ) from the combination of _ two _ properties : coupling magnitudes scaling to zero as @xmath53 , and quenched disorder in their signs .",
    "( some success has been achieved in defining states in mean - field hopfield models  see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein  where the correct order parameters are known _ a priori_. )    although individual pure states have not so far been ( and perhaps can not even in principle be ) constructed for the sk model , we have nevertheless proposed methods , based on chaotic size dependence  @xcite , that can detect the _ presence _ of multiple pure states .",
    "one can then examine the nature of objects that are analogous to states and that are defined through local variables , using the usual prescriptions of statistical mechanics .",
    "however , an analysis  @xcite of the properties of these state - like objects shows that they behave in completely unsatisfactory  in fact , absurd  ways .",
    "for example , using the traditional definition of a ground state  or equivalently , the modified clustering property of  ( [ eq : modclustering ] )  one can prove that ( for almost every fixed coupling realization  @xmath11 ) _ every _ infinite - volume spin configuration is a ground state .",
    "that is , as @xmath2 increases , any fixed finite set of correlation functions cycles through all of its possible sign configurations infinitely many times . of course , this can not happen in short - range spin glasses in any dimension , nor in any other statistical mechanical model based on any sort of physical system .",
    "the upshot is that global variables ( like overlap distributions for the whole system ) capture interesting phenomena in the sk model , while local variables are not so interesting there ; in fact , their use can even be dangerous in drawing conclusions about realistic spin glass models",
    ". this may be because the sk model itself is _ a priori _ a global ( or at least nonlocal ) model , and does not lend itself even in principle to any sort of local analysis .",
    "a large body of evidence compiled by the authors  @xcite shows that local variables and states in the ea model do not behave anything like those in the sk model .",
    "the same conclusion applies to global variables in the ea model constructed in close analogy with those from the sk model  that is , in a way intended to convey information about states .",
    "this will be further discussed in  @xcite .",
    "consequently , we expect that attempts to derive conclusions about the ea model in terms of local properties ( i.e. , pure state behavior ) from the global behavior of the sk model will not work .",
    "in this section we consider an interesting speculative question motivated by a comment of a.  bovier  @xcite that the usual description of gibbs measures for short - range models is inadequate for mean field spin glasses .",
    "we have presented a large body of evidence that any quantity , describing spin glass properties and that is derived from or based on properties of pure states , can not connect the behavior of short - range and infinite - range spin glasses . but can one construct a new type of global variable that is meaningful for both short - range and infinite - range spin glass models , and allows a direct comparison of their properties ?",
    "one obvious candidate is a ` global ' overlap function not related to pure states ; that is , rather than computing @xmath57 in a ` window '  @xcite far from @xmath58 , one would compute it in the entire volume @xmath23 . as discussed in  @xcite",
    ", the resulting quantity may be unrelated to pure state structure .",
    "an analogous situation is the ferromagnet _ above _ the roughening temperature ( but below @xmath43 ) . even though there are no domain wall states , employing dobrushin boundary conditions  ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : nnifs ] ) will generate spin configurations that on very large scales ( say , of order @xmath42 ) look almost indistinguishable from those belonging to domain wall states .",
    "but it s unclear whether doing this generates any useful or nonobvious information .",
    "similarly ( see  @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) there is reason to doubt whether a global overlap distribution would be any more useful . in the sk model",
    "boundary conditions are not an issue ; but in short - range models , overlaps are potentially very sensitive to them .",
    "one consequence  @xcite of this sensitivity is that spin overlap functions are unreliable indicators of pure state multiplicity : they can possess a trivial structure ( cf .  fig .",
    "1(d ) in the companion paper in this volume  @xcite ) in systems with infinitely many pure states , and a more complicated structure  @xcite in systems with only a single pure state . in particular , spin overlap functions computed in systems with",
    "quenched disorder can easily display complicated and nonphysical behavior that simply reflects the ` mismatch ' between the boundary condition choice and the local coupling variables .",
    "consequently , nontrivial spin overlaps invariably generated by a change in boundary conditions ( e.g. , by switching from periodic to antiperiodic in spin glasses ) may carry no more significance than that , say , in the 2d ising ferromagnet ( for @xmath38 ) generated by dobrushin boundary conditions .",
    "these considerations make it difficult to believe that a spin overlap variable  even when confined to a window  is likely to uncover generally useful information in short - range spin glasses .",
    "nevertheless , one can conceive and construct different , and possibly more useful , global quantities that can provide useful statistical mechanical information . of greater interest",
    ", they _ can _ be used in principle to compare and contrast physically meaningful behaviors of short - range and infinite - range spin glasses .",
    "we propose here that one such set of quantities are those related to _ interfaces _ between spin configurations drawn at random from finite - volume gibbs distributions at fixed @xmath42 and @xmath12 .    the interface between two such configurations @xmath59 and",
    "@xmath60 is simply the set of all couplings that are satisfied in one of the two configurations but not the other .",
    "an interface separates regions where the spins in the two configurations agree from those where they disagree .",
    "we propose that the global variables of interest are those  in particular , density and energy  characterizing the physical properties of these interfaces .",
    "the use of interfaces as a probe of spin glass structure is not new .",
    "our purpose here is to argue , based on the overall approach described in this note , that their properties provide a significantly more natural and useful set of global spin glass variables than the spin overlap function .",
    "the interface density in particular has of course been studied in earlier papers  @xcite , and its potential significance has been particularly emphasized in  @xcite . the quantity studied is usually the edge overlap @xmath61 between @xmath59 and @xmath60 : @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the number of bonds inside @xmath23 .",
    "in the sk model , the edge overlap is defined similarly , except that the sum runs over every pair of spins .    in the sk model",
    ", there is a trivial relationship between the edge and spin overlaps .",
    "consider two spin configurations @xmath64 and @xmath65 in an @xmath2-spin system ; their spin overlap is defined in the usual way as @xmath66 it is easy to see that @xmath67 in short - range models , including spin glasses , however , there is no simple relationship between the two .",
    "for example , the uniform spin configuration and that with a single domain wall running along the equator ( generated , e.g. , using dobrushin boundary conditions on the ferromagnet at zero temperature in dimensions greater than or equal to two ) have an edge overlap of one and a spin overlap of zero .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the edge overlap is only one interesting quantity providing information ( in this case , density ) about the interface .",
    "we will argue that by itself it does not provide sufficient information to distinguish among various interesting pictures of the spin glass phase .",
    "other quantities , in particular the energy scaling of the interface , are also required for a useful description to emerge .",
    "we can now list several reasons why the density , energy , and possibly other variables associated with interfaces between states constitute a useful set of global spin glass variables .",
    "\\0 ) ( preliminary technical point . ) _ the quantities being studied can be clearly defined .",
    "_ this is accomplished through the metastate ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : meta ] ) and its natural extensions .",
    "as discussed elsewhere , a probability measure on low - energy interfaces can be generated and studied through the periodic boundary condition uniform perturbation metastate  @xcite , while one on higher - energy interfaces can be constructed via a modification of that used in constructing the _ excitation metastate _ in  @xcite .",
    "\\1 ) _ the quantities proposed are truly global ; i.e. , there is no need to use a ` window ' .",
    "_ the reason for this is presented in the next point .",
    "\\2 ) _ the edge overlap , computed in the entire volume , can provide unambiguous information about pure state multiplicity .",
    "_ this is in contrast to the spin overlap function . a rigorous formulation and proof of this statement ( in the case of zero temperature )",
    "was provided in  @xcite .",
    "( the results can be extended to nonzero temperatures by `` pruning '' from the interfaces small thermally induced droplets  @xcite . )",
    "informally stated , the theorem presented in that paper stated that if edge overlaps were space - filling ( that is , their density did not tend to zero with @xmath42 ) , then there must be multiple pure state pairs ( e.g. , in the appropriate periodic b.c .",
    "metastate ) . otherwise , there is only a single pair .",
    "it needs to be noted here that this result is restricted to boundary conditions chosen _ independently _ of the couplings ( which is always the case in numerical simulations and theoretical computations ) .",
    "it is conceivable that appropriately chosen coupling-_dependent _ boundary conditions can generate ` interface states ' , separated by domain walls of vanishing density , as occur below the roughening temperature in ising ferromagnets ; but no procedure for constructing such boundary conditions has yet been found .",
    "\\3 ) _ interface structure also provides information on thermodynamically relevant non - pure state structure , in particular , the distribution and energies of excitations . _",
    "this is a potentially important use of the procedures of krzakala - martin  @xcite and palassini - young  @xcite , and is described in more detail in  @xcite .",
    "\\4 ) _ the scaling of the edge overlap with energy allows one to distinguish between different scenarios of the low - temperature phase at zero temperature .",
    "_ at zero temperature , the spin overlap function in any volume is identical in the scaling - droplet  @xcite , chaotic pairs  @xcite , and rsb scenarios  @xcite ( see the companion paper  @xcite for a detailed description of these three pictures ) , but the interface density and energy , when used together , can distinguish among all of these pictures ( as well as the ` km / py ' scenario of krzakala - martin  @xcite and palassini - young  @xcite ) .",
    "this is summarized in fig .  1 .",
    "[ fig : table ]    \\5 ) _ the interface properties discussed here provide a means of comparing behavior of sk- and short - range spin glasses . _",
    "that is , use of interface properties allows comparison without requiring recourse to pure state notions , which as discussed above are poorly defined in the sk model .",
    "so , while they provide much ( although not all  see below ) useful information about pure state structure in short - range models , they are also well - defined in sk models and allow for direct comparison of the two .",
    "it should always be kept in mind , however , that ultimately the interface variables we have been discussing discard a significant amount of important information on local correlations ; this is to be expected from any global variable .",
    "these variables should therefore be viewed as providing _",
    "additional _ useful information to the usual local ( i.e. , thermodynamic ) variables ; it is dangerous to view them as a replacement for those variables .",
    "consequently , even while providing the arguments in this section , we emphasize that interface  or any other global  variables can play at best a secondary role in describing the statistical mechanics of finite - range models , where well - defined state - based quantities already exist .",
    "it is only in the sk model , where such quantities are mostly absent , that global quantities play a more primary  perhaps the only  role .    throughout much of this section we referred to useful properties of a thermodynamic object",
    "we have called the metastate .",
    "we conclude by defining this object , which in turn enables us to return to the observation made at the beginning of this note .",
    "we are interested in the thermodynamic behavior of large , finite systems , containing on the order of @xmath68 interacting degrees of freedom .",
    "corresponding infinite volume limits serve two purposes . mathematically",
    ", they enable precise definitions of quantities corresponding to physical variables ; physically , they allow one to approximate large finite systems ( usually when surface effects can be ignored compared to bulk phenomena ) .",
    "they allow a deep conceptual understanding of important physical phenomena ; probably the best - known example is understanding phase transitions in terms of singularities or discontinuities of thermodynamic functions .",
    "it is of course a fact that such phenomena correspond to true mathematical singularities only in strictly infinite systems , while common sense dictates that phase transitions in physical systems are quite real , and involve behavior as singular or discontinuous as can be found anywhere in the physical world .",
    "that is precisely why infinite volume limits are properly regarded as convenient and useful mathematical descriptions of large finite systems .",
    "when dealing with the usual sort of _ global _ variable such as energy , we see no serious issues arising in disordered systems , nor do we expect that there is any conceptual divergence from homogeneous systems .",
    "thus , for example , the calculation of the sk free energy per spin in the parisi solution relies completely on taking the @xmath53 limit ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "any difficulties involved are really of a technical , rather than a conceptual , nature , and they have finally been rigorously resolved  @xcite .",
    "it is when dealing with _",
    "variables that serious problems arise , and here the behavior of models with quenched disorder seems to diverge dramatically from that of homogeneous ones . in almost all well - known homogeneous models , such as uniform ferromagnets",
    ", there is simple convergence , as volume goes to infinity , to a single gibbs state at high temperature ; or to several , related via well - understood symmetry transformations , at low temperature .",
    "there the nature of the finite - volume approximation to the infinite - volume limit is conceptually clear and no difficulties arise .",
    "but what if  as has often been conjectured for finite - range spin glasses  there are many pure states and they are not simply related to each other by symmetry transformations ?",
    "mathematically , this means that if one looks at a local variable , such as a single - spin or two - spin correlation function , there exist many possible ( subsequence ) limits . when this happens , it is not even immediately clear how to obtain a well - defined infinite - volume limit .",
    "this is largely a consequence of _ chaotic size dependence _ , first demonstrated in  @xcite as an unavoidable signature of many states .",
    "briefly put , local variables , such as correlations , will vary chaotically and unpredictably as volume size changes ( with , say , periodic boundary conditions on each volume ) .",
    "in fact , this chaotic size dependence was proposed by us as a test of the presence of many pure state pairs .",
    "consequently , convergence of _ states _ to a thermodynamic limit is no longer as simple as just taking a sequence of volumes of arithmetically , say , or geometrically increasing lengths  a process that works fine for homogeneous systems .",
    "it turns out that such limits _ can _ be defined , but it takes a little work  @xcite .",
    "however , the existence of limiting thermodynamic _ states _ turns out not to be the essential problem .",
    "as noted , such states do exist and are well - defined ; but they turn out not to contain the information needed to fully understand the system _ in large finite volumes_. so now there does , at first glance , seem to be a conflict between the thermodynamic limit and behavior in large finite volumes .",
    "but such a conclusion is premature  with more work , not only can the two be reconciled again , but an entirely new set of concepts and insights arises .",
    "so we turn to the question : is it even possible in such systems to describe the nature of large finite volume systems via a single infinite volume object , and if so , how ?",
    "the answer to the first question is yes  @xcite , and to the second is : by an infinite volume object that captures the nature of the behavior of the finite systems as volume increases  i.e. , by the _ metastate _  @xcite describing the empirical distribution of local variables as volume increases without bound .",
    "such behavior in @xmath42 is analogous to chaotic behavior in time @xmath69 along the orbit of a chaotic dynamical system . in each case",
    "the behavior is deterministic but effectively unpredictable .",
    "consequently , it can be modelled via random sampling from some distribution @xmath70 on the space of states . in the case of dynamical systems , one can in principle reconstruct @xmath70 by keeping a record of the proportion of time the particle spends in each coarse - grained region of state space .",
    "similarly , one can prove @xcite that for inhomogeneous systems like spin glasses , a similar distribution exists : even in the presence of chaotic size dependence , the _ fraction _ of volumes in which a given thermodynamic state @xmath71 appears , converges ( at least along a sparse sequence of volumes ) . by saying that a thermodynamic state @xmath71 ( which is an infinite - volume quantity ) ` appears ' within a finite volume @xmath23 , we mean the following : within a window deep inside the volume , correlation functions computed using the finite - volume gibbs state @xmath72 are the same as those computed using @xmath71 ( with negligibly small deviations ) .",
    "hence , the metastate allows one to reconstruct the behavior of large finite volumes from an infinite - volume object , which contains far more information than any mixed thermodynamic state , such as those often used as a starting point in rsb analyses .",
    "because technical details have been provided in several other places  @xcite , we do not repeat them here .",
    "we do however refer the reader to  @xcite where we examine more closely the nature of the low - temperature spin glass phase , from the point of view of metastates ."

    "<S> we further propose a set of ` global variables ' that are definable and sensible for both short - range and infinite - range spin glasses , and allow a meaningful basis for comparison of their low - temperature properties .    </S>",
