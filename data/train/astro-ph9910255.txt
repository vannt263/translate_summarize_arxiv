    "deglitching is performed for each individual ramp and then the mean signal per position is derived by averaging the linear fit on each ramp ( see gabriel et al .",
    "1997 for details ) .",

    "the calibration is performed by deriving the mean value of the two fcs measurements .",
    "the contribution of the long term drift is thus lower than 5@xmath15 .",
    "flat fielding is achieved using the high redundancy in the measurements .",
    "glitches inducing long term drifts are also corrected .",
    "the flux is finally projected on a 10``x10 '' coordinate grid using our own projection procedure .",
    "+ the final calibration is achieved using the footprint measured on saturn .",
    "it is presented in fig . 1 of puget et al .",
    "brightnesses derived using this footprint are in very good agreement with dirbe .",
    "the footprint measured on saturn has been compared to the one derived from the diffraction model , including the tripode ( klaas et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the model takes into account the bandpass filter and is computed for a @xmath16i@xmath17=constant spectrum .",
    "thus , comparison between the model and saturn footprints allows to test the wavelength dependence of the footprint . the solid angle supported by the two",
    "footprint differs only by 25@xmath15 .",
    "comparison of the two footprints power spectra , ws@xmath18 ( saturn ) and wm@xmath18 ( model ) , is shown on fig .",

    "the saturn fwhm footprint is quite larger than the model one .",
    "the difference between these power spectra will be considered in sect .",
    "[ pest ] . +",
    "the marano1 observations consist of four 19x19 rasters .",
    "each raster was performed in the spacecraft ( y , z ) coordinate system which is parallel to the edges of the detector array . the field area covered by each raster",
    "is about 30x30. the exposure time is 16s per pixel .",
    "rasters were performed with one pixel overlap in each y and z direction .",
    "therefore , for the maximum redundancy region , the effective exposure time is 256 sec per sky position ( 16 sec per pixel , 4 rasters and redundancy of 4 ) .",
    "displacements between the four raster centers correspond to 2 pixels .",
    "this mode of observation , which does not provide proper sampling of the point - spread - function , was chosen deliberately because it allows a very clean determination of the instrumental noise . + the final map is made of 16 coadded independent maps .",
    "the extraction of extra - galactic sources and determination of their fluxes are made on this final coadded map . to compute the instrumental noise ,",
    "we have measured the flux of the detected sources on the 16 independent maps .",
    "we then compute for each source the standard deviation with respect to the flux measured on the coadded map .",
    "the average of all the standard deviations gives the instrumental noise .",
    "we obtain 1.74  mjy rms in a 89.4@xmath1989.4  pixel .",
    "the signal in the map is around 3  mjy / sr .",
    "this leads to a very high signal to noise ratio in the map of about 300 .",
    "+ using the four maps of the marano1 field presented in fig . 2 of puget et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we can make an estimate of the instrumental noise power spectrum , making the difference between the independent maps .",
    "we know that this power spectrum contains low spatial frequency noise , due to small distorsions in the flat field and slow response changes during the observations . with such map differences ,",
    "we obtain instrumental noise power spectra for pairs of maps which are all more than 10 times smaller than the measured total flux power spectum ( which is presented in fig .",
    "the instrumental noise power spectrum is rather flat in the range k=[0.1 , 0.5 ] arcmin@xmath20 ( about 30 jy@xmath21/sr at k@xmath220.2 arcmin@xmath20 and 10 jy@xmath21/sr at k@xmath220.4 arcmin@xmath20 ) and is in very good agreement with the one deduced from the noise ( assumed to be white ) computed on the extra - galactic sources ( 1.74  mjy rms in a 89.4@xmath1989.4  pixel ) .",
    "the measured instrumental noise power spectrum is subtracted to the measured power spectrum before the analysis .",
    "in the marano1 field , 24 extra - galactic sources are detected with fluxes ranging from 100 to 850 mjy ( puget et al . 1999 ) .",
    "sources have been extracted up to the confusion limit ( 3@xmath23=67.2 mjy ) and source fluxes been computed using the saturn footprint measurement for which a significant fraction of the integral is in the wing ( and which is in good agreement with the footprint model ) .",
    "the source subtraction from the marano1 map is very straightforward .",
    "we subtract at each source position the footprint , sampled at 10 arcsec and normalised to unit integral , multiplied by the source flux .",
    "the map obtained after the source subtraction is given fig .  2 together with the original map .",
    "the standard deviation in the source subtracted map is around 0.14 mjy / sr , which is very close to the one of the original map which is about 0.15 mjy / sr . for the mean brightness",
    ", the difference between the two maps is less than 1@xmath15 .",
    "these numbers clearly show that the background fluctuations are not dominated by strong sources detected above the confusion limit . as for the original map",

    "+    background fluctuations ( fig .",
    "2b ) are made of two components : the galactic cirrus one and the extra - galactic one ( the instrumental noise is negligible and is not correlated ) .",
    "we are going now to discuss the relative contribution of these two components .",
    "our separation of the extra - galactic and galactic fluctuations is based on a power spectrum decomposition .",
    "this method allows us to discriminate the two components using the statistical properties of their spatial behaviour .",
    "+ we know from previous works that the cirrus far - infrared emission power spectrum has a steep slope in @xmath24 ( gautier et al .",

    "no characteristic scale has been identified in the diffuse interstellar medium ( falgarone 1998 ) .",
    "+ for the extra - galactic fluctuations , little is known .",
    "the power spectrum of galaxy clustering has been mainly studied from optical surveys .",
    "the main result is that the power spectrum can be represented by a simple power law with an index equal to -1.3 at spatial frequency larger than @xmath220.1 degree@xmath20 ( groth & peebles 1977 ; maddox et al .",
    "1990 ; peacock 1991 ; kashlinsky 1992 ) . for small spatial frequency ,",
    "if we assume the standard inflationary model ( @xmath25=1 and the harrison - zeldovich power spectrum on large scales ) , the galaxy power spectrum is proportional to k. at far - ir wavelengths , nothing is known about the galaxy clustering .",
    "a spatial and redshift distribution similar to the optical surveys ( as the `` automatic plate measuring '' survey ) will give a negative slope around -1.3 whereas a poissonian distribution will give a flat power spectrum .",
    "+ in summary , we know that the cirrus emission power spectrum is steep and does not present any characteristic scale .",
    "the extra - galactic component is unknown but certainly much flatter .",
    "we thus conclude that the steep spectrum observed in our data at k@xmath260.15 arcmin@xmath20 ( fig .",
    "3 ) can only be due to the cirrus emission .",
    "the break in the power spectrum at k@xmath22 0.2 arcmin@xmath20 is very unlikely to be due to the cirrus emission itself which is known not to exhibit any prefered scale .",
    "thus , the power spectrum is a powerful tool for a first order separation between the galactic and extra - galactic background component .",
    "we now give and discuss the quantative separation of the two components .",
    "the cirrus emission has a filamentary structure which , as discussed above , exhibits a spatial power spectrum which has been first determined at 100  @xmath0 m from iras data by gautier et al . (",

    "this normalisation does not necessarily apply to our very low cirrus emission field . for this reason , the normalisation",
    "is directly determined using the measured power spectrum ( fig .",
    "3 ) . using the low frequency data points and assuming a @xmath24 dependance",
    ", we find a power spectum of : @xmath29 with k in arcmin@xmath20 .",
    "the main uncertainty comes from the footprint used for deriving @xmath30 .",
    "the normalisation of the power spectrum derived from the low frequency data points agrees reasonably well with wright ( 1998 ) dirbe results at high galactic latitude .",

    "we clearly see an excess between k=0.25 and 0.6 arcmin@xmath20 which is more than a factor 10 at k=0.4 arcmin@xmath20 . any reasonable power law spectrum for the cirrus component multiplied by the footprint leads , as can be easily seen in fig . 3 , to a very steep spectrum at spatial frequency k@xmath340.2 arcmin@xmath20 .",
    "this is very different from the observed spectrum .",
    "the excess is quite independent of the footprint used .",
    "moreover , it is more than 10 times larger than the measured instrumental noise power spectrum",
    ". therefore , as no other major source of fluctuations is expected at this wavelength , the large excess observed between k=0.25 and 0.6 arcmin@xmath20 is interpreted as due to unresolved extra - galactic sources .",
    "the anisotropies of the background are thus dominated , at angular scales close to the angular resolution , by the structure of the cfirb .",
    "this is the first detection of the fluctuations of the cfirb .",
    "+ cfirb fluctuations are clearly detected between k=0.25 and 0.6 arcmin@xmath20 .",
    "this interval has not enough dynamic range to constrain the slope of the cfirb fluctuation power spectrum : our present study does not allow to clearly constrain the clustering of galaxies .",
    "however , the power spectrum mean level can be determined . + power spectra with simple power law with index smaller than -1 are not compatible with our measured power spectrum . for indexes in the range [ -1,0 ] ,",
    "the different power laws give equivalent results .",
    "for example , on fig . 4 is shown the total power spectrum obtained by summing up the cirrus confusion noise and a constant cfirb fluctuation power spectrum , p@xmath35  =  7400 jy@xmath21/sr .",
    "this white noise power spectrum level is in very good agreement with the one predicted by guiderdoni et al .",
    "this gives cfirb rms fluctuations around 0.07 mjy / sr ( for a range of spatial frequency up to 5 arcmin@xmath20 ) .",
    "these fluctuations are at the @xmath229 percent level , which is very close to the predictions of haiman & knox ( 1999 ) .",
    "we have shown in the marano1 region ( 30@xmath1930 ) that the extra - galactic background fluctuations are well above the instrumental noise and the cirrus confusion noise .",
    "the observed power spectrum shows a flattening at high spatial frequencies which is due to extra - galactic unresolved sources . a preliminary study on the firback n1 field ( 2 square degrees )",

    "the statistical analysis of the background fluctuations using the full firback fields , covering different high galactic latitude regions , will allow to constrain models of galaxy evolution and will be a very useful tool for cosmological studies until large passively cooled telescopes in space become available which will allow number counts down to a few mjy .",
    "the next step consists of removing the cirrus contribution using gas tracers ( the h@xmath36 and the 21 cm emission lines ) to isolate the extra - galactic fluctuation brightness and thus constrain the clustering of galaxies .",
