    "the theory of classical thermodynamics has been well supported by the methods of equilibrium statistical physics , which in turn is based on the boltzmann probability distribution for the states of a system in phase space . for systems that are slightly away from equilibrium ( where the perturbation to the system can be assumed to be linearly",
    "coupled to the applied weak force field ) , the linear response theory characterizes the response of the system in terms of equilibrium correlation functions . however , there are only very few exact results that remain valid even when the system is driven arbitrarily out of equilibrium .",
    "the fluctuation theorems have been one of them .",
    "first introduced for thermostatted systems following dissipative but deterministic dynamics by evans and searles @xcite , it has produced several closely related equalities @xcite , some theorems holding in general for all systems while the others being satisfied for special cases ( for example , in the limit of a large observation time ) . in a nutshell , these theorems have the following general form : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is some observable that is to be measured and is in general a path function , @xmath2 is the probability density of this observable along a process ( usually parametrized by an externally controlled time - dependent protocol @xmath3 ) and @xmath4 is the probability density whose functional form is related to @xmath5 through a conjugate transformation which is not necessarily time - reversal .",
    "its argument @xmath6 is the value assumed by the observable along the transformed trajectory in phase space .",
    "some observables that have been shown to follow the fluctuation theorems are entropy , work and heat @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that the theorems are closely related to the second law , in the sense that the averaged observable @xmath7 always abides by the inequalities dictated by the second law .",
    "for instance , the total entropy of the system plus environment can be shown to give rise to the inequality @xcite @xmath8 what this inequality says is that , even though some individual realizations of the experiment may observe a decrease in the total entropy , its _ average _ value must never decrease with time .",
    "an issue that has recently attracted much interest is the use of feedback - controlled protocol to enhance the efficiency of such a process @xcite . instead of using a predetermined protocol",
    ", we can perform intermediate measurements on some observable and modify our protocol accordingly .",
    "we are in general not interested in the measuring device involved in the experiment ( which definitely belongs to the `` universe '' in which second law must be obeyed ) .",
    "it is obvious that the form of the second law , now dealing with only a part of the universe under consideration , needs to be modified .",
    "as expected , the correction term involves the properties of the ignored subpart , in the form of the mutual information gained through measurements and gives rise to the following inequality : @xmath9 here , the mutual information is defined as @xcite @xmath10 where the presence of measurement errors is assumed . in the arguments of the conditional probability @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the outcome when a measurement is performed , while @xmath13 is the actual value of the observable .",
    "the averaging has been done over all possible phase space trajectories _ as well as _ over all possible protocol functions , which results due to the different feedback rules corresponding to different outcomes .",
    "since @xmath14 is a relative entropy and consequently always non - negative @xcite , the above inequality provides us with the privilege of extracting work from or obtaining a decrease in entropy of the system , provided we can formulate a nice feedback algorithm . note that eq .",
    "( [ law2_mod ] ) only says that the lower bound for the dissipated work ( or entropy ) _ can _ be decreased by an amount proportional to the average mutual information .",
    "however , it does not provide any clue to what a good feedback algorithm should be . in this sense , it is reasonable to look for a quantity that actually provides a quantitative measure of how efficient an employed feedback procedure is .",

    "the efficacy parameter has been measured experimentally @xcite and equations ( [ ejea ] ) and ( [ ejeb ] ) have been verified . using the jensen s inequality , we have the dissipated work bounded from below through the relation @xmath28\\ra \\ge -\\ln\\gamma\\ ] ] although this inequality looks similar to the one stated before , it may seem to be a trivial statement because it is a simple consequence of the definition of @xmath26 . however , the fact that this definition lends a very clear physical meaning to the efficacy parameter and that this meaning can be exploited to experimentally measure @xmath26 ( without using the definition eq .",

    "we thus find that the physical meaning of efficacy parameter can be very generally stated as follows : _ it is the total probability to observe the measured outcomes conjugate to those along the forward protocol , for the intermediate measurements along the process with the corresponding conjugate dynamics .",

    "thus , the efficacy parameter is a far more suitable experimentally measurable quantity that can characterize not only the performance of the system , but can also act as a useful lower bound for the averaged observables .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that out of the two known forms of the modified fluctuation theorems in presence of feedback , one of the forms is heavily dependent on the way feedback is applied along the conjugate process , and thereby leads to arbitrary number of lower bounds for work done on the system or for the relevant entropy changes ( total entropy , nonadiabatic and adiabatic entropies ) taking place .",
    "on the other hand , the second form , namely the fluctuation theorem expressed in terms of the efficacy parameter , provides a bound for work and entropy changes that carries a clear and consistent physical meaning , irrespective of the manner of application of feedback along the conjugate process .",
    "this consistency is robust even when the conjugate process is not the time - reversed process .",
    "this study would hopefully help in simpler experimental verification of the extended fluctuation theorems .",

    "<S> the fluctuation theorems have remained one of the cornerstones in the study of systems that are driven far out of equilibrium , and they provide strong constraints on the fraction of trajectories that behave atypically in light of the second law . </S>",
    "<S> they have mainly been derived for a predetermined external drive applied to the system . </S>",
    "<S> however , to improve the efficiency of a process , one needs to incorporate protocols that are modified by receiving feedbacks about the recent state of the system , during its evolution . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case , the forms of the conventional fluctuation theorems get modified , the correction term involving terms that depend on the way the reverse / conjugate process is defined , namely , the rules of using feedback in order to generate the exact time - reversed / conjugate protocols . </S>",
    "<S> we show in this paper that this can be done in a large number of ways , and in each case we would get a different expression for the correction terms . </S>",
    "<S> this would in turn lead to several lower bounds on the mean work that must be performed on the system , or on the entropy changes . here </S>",
    "<S> we analyze a form of the extended fluctuation theorems that involves the efficacy parameter , and find that this form gives rise to a lower bound for the mean work that retains a consistent physical meaning regardless of the design of feedback along the conjugate process , as opposed to the case of the previously mentioned form of the modified fluctuation theorems .    </S>",
