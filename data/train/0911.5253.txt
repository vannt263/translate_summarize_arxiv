    "four - positions theory studies the geometry of four proper euclidean displacements , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  5 ,   89 ) .",
    "often , it is considered as a discretization of differential properties of order three of a smooth one - parameter motion . in this article",
    "we take a different point of view and regard the four displacements as an elementary cell in a quadrilateral net of positions , that is , the discretization of a two- or more - parameter motion .",
    "motivated by applications in the rising field of discrete differential geometry @xcite we intend to study quadrilateral nets of positions such that the relative displacement between neighbouring positions is a pure rotation .",
    "the present text shall provide foundations for this project .",
    "thus , the questions we are interested in are induced from discrete differential geometry .",
    "nonetheless , our contributions seem to be of a certain interest in their own right .",
    "denote the four displacements by @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and the relative displacements of consecutive positions by @xmath4 ( indices modulo four ) .",
    "we require that every relative displacement @xmath5 is a _ pure rotation . _ in this case we call the quadruple @xmath6 a _ rotation quadrangle .",
    "_ rotation quadrangles with additional properties ( the displacements @xmath7 and @xmath8 are also rotations ) have been studied in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  5 ,    9 ) .",
    "our contribution is more general and we provide answers to questions not asked in @xcite .    in section  [ sec : construction - rotation - quadrilaterals ] we address the problem of constructing rotation quadrilaterals .",
    "kinematic mapping turns out to be a versatile tools for this task .",
    "subsequently , we study points @xmath9 whose homologous images @xmath10 lie on a circle ( section  [ sec : homologous - points ] ; figure  [ fig : homologous - points - planes - lines ] , left ) , oriented planes @xmath11 whose homologous images @xmath12 are tangent to a cone of revolution ( section  [ sec : homologous - planes ] ; figure  [ fig : homologous - points - planes - lines ] , center ) , and oriented lines @xmath13 whose homologous images @xmath14 form a skew quadrilateral on a hyperboloid of revolution ( section  [ sec : homologous - lines ] ; figure  [ fig : homologous - points - planes - lines ] , right ) .",
    "one position in a rotation quadrilateral , say @xmath0 , can be chosen arbitrarily without affecting the quadrilateral s geometry .",
    "the remaining positions can be constructed inductively by suitable rotations but the final position @xmath3 must be such that both @xmath15 and @xmath16 are rotations .",
    "this is certainly possible , albeit a little tedious , in euclidean three space .",
    "the quadric model of euclidean displacements , obtained by study s kinematic mapping @xcite seems to be a more appropriate setting for this task .",
    "it transforms two positions corresponding in a relative rotation to conjugate points on the study quadric @xmath17 .",
    "more precisely , the composition of all rotations about a fixed axis with a fixed displacement is a straight line in the study quadric .",
    "thus , a rotation quadrilateral corresponds , via study s kinematic mapping , to a skew quadrilateral @xmath18 in the study quadric .",
    "we require here and in the following that @xmath18 spans a three - space which is not completely contained in the study quadric @xmath17 .",
    "this genericity assumption is not fulfilled in the special configuration studied in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  5 ,    9 ) .    the quadrilateral @xmath18 is uniquely determined by three suitable chosen vertices @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and the connecting line of @xmath21 and the missing vertex @xmath22 .",
    "alternatively , @xmath18 is determined by two opposite vertices , say @xmath19 and @xmath21 , and two opposite edges . in any case",
    "the input data defines a three - space whose intersection with the study quadric is a hyperboloid @xmath23 containing @xmath18 .",
    "the completion of the missing data is easy . denoting the relative revolute axes in the moving space by @xmath24 the translation of these considerations into the language of kinematics",
    "reads :    [ th : rotation - quadrangle-1 ] a rotation quadrangle is uniquely determined by    1 .",
    "a fixed displacement @xmath25 , three revolute axis @xmath24 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and two rotation angles @xmath28 and  @xmath29 ( indices modulo four ) or 2 .   by two displacement @xmath25 , @xmath30 and two relative revolute axes @xmath24 , @xmath27 ( indices modulo four ) .",
    "computing the actual rotation angles and line coordinates of the revolute axes from the quadrilateral @xmath18 is straightforward .",
    "the necessary formulas are , for example , found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* satz  13 ) .",
    "beware that @xcite uses conventions for the study parameters that slightly differ from modern authors , for example @xcite or @xcite .",
    "therefore minor adaptions to the formulas may be necessary .",
    "now we turn to the study of the locus of points in the moving space whose homologous images lie on a circle ( figure  [ fig : homologous - points - planes - lines ] , left ) . as usual",
    "we consider straight lines as special circles of infinite radius . if the four relative displacements are general screws , the sought locus is known to be an algebraic curve of degree six @xcite . in case of rotation quadrilaterals this is still true but the curve is highly reducible :    [ th : homologous - points ] the locus of points in the moving space whose homologous images lie on a circle consists of the four relative revolute axis @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and their two transversals @xmath35 and  @xmath36 .    by the general result of @xcite",
    "the sought locus can consist of six lines at most .",
    "we show that all points on the six lines mentioned in the theorem have indeed homologous images on circles . for points",
    "@xmath37 this is trivially true since we have @xmath38 . since any transversal carries four points of this type , lemma  [ lem : coplanar - points ] below , implies the same property for all points on @xmath35 and  @xmath36 .",
    "( at least the first part of this lemma is well - known .",
    "an old reference is @xcite . )",
    "[ lem : coplanar - points ] consider a straight line @xmath13 in the moving space and four affine displacements .",
    "if @xmath13 contains four points whose homologous images are co - planar than this is the case for all points of @xmath13 .",
    "if , in addition , the homologous images of three points lie on circle , this is the case for all points of  @xmath13 .",
    "we can parametrize the homologous images of @xmath13 as @xmath39 such that points of the same parameter value @xmath40 are homologous .",
    "the co - planarity condition reads @xmath41 ( we omit the argument @xmath40 for sake of readability ) . since it is at most of degree three in @xmath40 , it vanishes identically if four zeros exist .",
    "this proves the first assertion of the lemma .",
    "four homologous points @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 lie on a circle ( or a straight line ) , if three independent bisector planes @xmath46 of @xmath47 and @xmath48 have a line , possibly at infinity , in common .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath49 corresponding points are assumed to be coplanar .",
    "therefore there exist scalars @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , not all of them zero , such that @xmath53 hence , the circularity condition becomes @xmath54 it is at most quadratic in @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , existence of three zeros implies its vanishing and the second assertion of the lemma is proved .",
    "the set of circles through quadruples of homologous points originating from a relative revolute axis @xmath24 is not very interesting in the context of this article . of more relevance",
    "is the set of circles generated by points of the transversal lines @xmath35 and  @xmath36 .",
    "[ th : hyperboloid ] the circles through homologous images of points of a transversal line ( @xmath35 or @xmath36 ) lie on a hyperboloid of revolution .    ]",
    "we consider only points on the transversal @xmath35 .",
    "any two of its successive homologous images @xmath55 , @xmath56 intersect in a point @xmath57 , the intersection point of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "therefore the lines @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 are the edges of a skew quadrilateral and lie on a pencil of hyperboloids .",
    "the intersection points with circles through homologous points form congruent ranges of points on the lines @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and the intersection points @xmath57 correspond in this relation .",
    "consider now a circle @xmath64 such that every intersections point @xmath65 with @xmath55 lies outside the segment @xmath66 $ ] for @xmath67 . setting @xmath68 ( figure  [ fig : trajectory - circles ] ) we see that @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "this implies @xmath71 . in other words ,",
    "both pairs of opposite edges in the skew quadrilateral @xmath72 have the same sum of lengths .",
    "this is a well - known criterion for the existence of a hyperboloid of revolution through @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and  @xmath63 .",
    "in this section we study the locus of planes @xmath11 in the moving space such that its homologous images @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 are tangent contact to a cone of revolution ( figure  [ fig : homologous - points - planes - lines ] , center ) .",
    "actually we will not discuss this in full generality but restrict ourselves to the case of _ oriented _ planes in _ oriented _ contact with a cone of revolution .",
    "this means the cone axis is the intersection line of the _ unique _ bisector planes of @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "having in mind applications in discrete differential geometry ( a kinematic generation of conical nets , see @xcite ) this additional assumption is justified .",
    "since the offset surface of a cone of revolution is again a cone of revolution , every plane parallel to a solution plane @xmath11 is a solution plane as well .",
    "we infer that the sought locus of planes consists of _ pencils of parallel planes_. this can also be confirmed by direct computation .",
    "denote by @xmath79 the plane coordinate vector of @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath80 is the homogeneous transformation matrix describing @xmath25 , the coordinate vectors @xmath81 of the homologous planes are found from @xmath82 the condition that they have a point in common reads @xmath83 and is of degree four in @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 . assuming that holds",
    ", the condition on the conical position can be stated in terms of the oriented normal vectors @xmath88 which are obtained from @xmath81 by dropping the first ( homogenizing ) coordinate .",
    "the planes are tangent to a cone of revolution if the four points with coordinate vectors @xmath88 lie on a circle ( note that these vectors have the same length ) .",
    "this condition results in a homogeneous cubic equation @xmath89 which is nothing but the circle - cone condition known from four - position synthesis of spherical four - bar linkages ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a closer inspection shows that there exists a homogeneous polynomial @xmath90 of degree four such that becomes @xmath91 hence , solution planes are characterized by the simultaneous vanishing of @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "since these equations are independent of @xmath84 , the value of the homogenizing coordinate can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "this is the algebraic manifestation of our observation that the solution consists of pencils of parallel planes .    since the two homogeneous equations @xmath92 and @xmath93 are of respective degrees four and three there exist at most twelve pencils of parallel planes whose homologous images are tangent to a cone of revolution .",
    "but not all of them are valid : the circle - cone equation @xmath93 also identifies vectors @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 that span a two - dimensional sub - space . the corresponding planes @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 are all parallel to a fixed direction but do not qualify as solution planes and have to be singled out . the complete description of all solution planes is given in    [ th : homologous - planes ] the locus of planes in the moving space whose homologous images are tangent to a cone of revolution consists of six pencils of parallel planes :    1 .",
    "the planes orthogonal to one of the four revolute axes @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and 2 .",
    "the planes orthogonal to one of the two transversals @xmath35 or @xmath36 of these axes .",
    "we already know that there exist at most twelve parallel pencils of solution planes , obtained by solving the quartic equation @xmath98 and the cubic equation @xmath89 . by lemma  [ lem : spherical - coplanar ] below",
    "( which actually has been proved in a more general context in @xcite ) , six of these pencils of planes are spurious and have to be subtracted from the totality of all solution planes .",
    "thus , we only have to show that the planes enumerated in the theorem are really solutions .",
    "this is obvious in case of a plane @xmath11 orthogonal to axis @xmath24 since @xmath77 and @xmath78 are identical . in case of a plane orthogonal to @xmath35 or @xmath36 it is an elementary consequence of theorem  [ th : hyperboloid ] .",
    "[ lem : spherical - coplanar ] consider four spherical displacements @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 . then there exist in general six lines ( possibly complex or coinciding ) through the origin of the moving coordinate frame , whose homologous lines are co - planar",
    ".    the co - planarity condition applied to a vector @xmath103 reads @xmath104 we compute classes of proportional solution vectors by solving the two cubic equations @xmath105 it has nine solutions .",
    "but the three fixed directions ( one real , two conjugate imaginary ) of the relative rotation @xmath106 are spurious so that only six valid solutions remain .",
    "finally , we also investigate the locus of lines @xmath13 in the moving frame whose homologous images @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 form a skew quadrilateral on a hyperboloid of revolution ( figure  [ fig : homologous - points - planes - lines ] , right ) . as usual , we restrict ourselves to generic configurations .",
    "moreover , we make an additional assumption on the line s orientation : setting @xmath111 ( indices modulo four ) we require that , when walking around the edges of the skew quadrilateral @xmath112 we follow the line s orientation only on every second edge ( figure  [ fig : homologous - points - planes - lines ] , right ) .",
    "the manifold of lines in euclidean three - space depends on four parameters .",
    "the mentioned condition on the four homologous images @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 of a line @xmath13 imposes , however , five conditions : four intersection conditions for the skew quadrilateral and one further condition for the hyperboloid of revolution .",
    "therefore , we expect no solution for a general screw quadrangle . on the other hand we already know ( theorem  [ th : hyperboloid ] ) that for rotation quadrangles the homologous images of two transversals @xmath35 and @xmath36 form the required configuration",
    ". we will show that these are the only solutions .    considering the skew quadrilateral condition only , it is obvious that either    * @xmath113 and @xmath114 intersect @xmath58 , possibly at a point at infinity , or * @xmath113 and @xmath114 are orthogonal to @xmath58 .",
    "only the first condition is compatible with our requirement on the orientation of the homologous lines .",
    "therefore , it is necessary that @xmath13 intersects all lines @xmath24 ( indices modulo four ) .",
    "hence @xmath115 or @xmath116 .",
    "combining this result with theorem  [ th : hyperboloid ] we arrive at    [ th : homologous - lines ] the two transversals @xmath35 and @xmath36 of the four relative revolute axes @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are the only lines whose homologous images form a skew quadrilateral ( with proper orientation ) on a hyperboloid of revolution .",
    "we investigated geometric structures related to four displacements @xmath25 ( @xmath67 ) such that the relative displacements @xmath4 are pure rotations .",
    "in particular , we completely characterized the points , planes and lines whose homologous images lie on a circle , are tangent to a cone of revolution or form a skew quadrilateral on a hyperboloid of revolution ( with proper orientation ) . in a next step",
