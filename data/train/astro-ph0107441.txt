    "low et al .  ( 1989 ) found that the majority of quasars in a small ir - selected sample were significantly redder than optically selected objects .",
    "sprayberry & foltz ( 1992 ) argue that the larger dust extinction and very weak emission features in low ionization broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars means that they are underrepresented in the known quasar population . using a much larger sample , webster et al .",

    "1997 ) and very weak or absent broad emission lines . further evidence of red quasars comes from x - ray surveys .",
    "dust reddened quasars are faint or invisible in soft x - rays because of the high columns of associated absorbing gas ( risaliti et al .",

    "determining the fraction of very red quasars in the total population , regardless of the cause of their redness , is essential for a precise determination of the quasar luminosity function , and bears directly on the evolution of quasars and the nature of the quasar - galaxy connection . also important is whether the red quasar population may harbor a significant number of optically faint , gravitationally lensed objects , where extinction in an intervening dusty lens reddens the quasar light and cancels the magnification bias which accompanies dust - free lensing ( bartelmann & loeb 1999 ) .",
    "a sizable population of red lensed quasars would have significant ramifications for any conclusions based on the statistics of gravitational lensing .",
    "the 2-micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; kleinmann et al .",

    "1997 ) , obtaining a sample dominated by extragalactic sources .",
    "particularly interesting for the red quasar question is the subset of first/2mass matches that are too faint in the optical to appear in extant optical catalogs such as the apm ( mcmahon & irwin 1992 ) .",
    "we are in the early stages of a program using imaging and spectroscopy to investigate the nature of these objects .",
    "we report here the discovery of two extremely red quasars from our sample , first  j013435.7@xmath0093102 ( also known as pks  0132@xmath0097 ) and first  j073820.1 + 275045 ( hereafter j0134@xmath00931 and j0738 + 2750 , respectively ) .",

    "both appear to be intrinsically red .",
    "one object , j0134 - 0931 , is extremely bright in the ir , which we argue below is due to gravitational lensing .",
    "the gravitationally lensed nature of j0134 - 0931 has been independently discovered by winn et al.(2001a ) , who investigate its radio properties in detail .",
    "we discuss whether the redness of these two quasars arises in the host galaxy or an intervening galaxy along the line of sight , and compare their properties to other very red quasars in the literature , in particular mg  0414 + 0534 ( hewitt et al .",
    "1992 ) and pks  1830@xmath0211 ( jauncey et al.1991 ; courbin et al .",

    "the intrinsically red interpretation leads us to speculate that many , perhaps even most , quasars may undergo a red phase early in their lives when the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) first turns on . if , on the other hand , the lensed quasars are reddened by dusty lensing galaxies , then there must exist numerous undiscovered , optically faint , gravitationally lensed quasars with small ( @xmath12 ) image separations .",

    "images of j0134 - 0931 were obtained with nirc in @xmath19 and @xmath20 in 2000 september , totaling 270s of integration each .",
    "conditions were photometric , the seeing at @xmath31 was 037 , and the instrument rotator problem ( which compromised the nirc observation of j0738 + 2750 ) had been fixed .",
    "the data were reduced using the dimsum package in iraf up to the point of sky subtraction , after which the dithered exposures were subsampled with a spline interpolation by a factor of 3.14 , then shifted and combined .",
    "the @xmath20 image ( figure  4 ) clearly resolves two components , the brighter component ( a ) being extended along one axis in both @xmath19 and @xmath20 bands .",

    "the apparent extremely large luminosity of j0134 - 0931 initially led us to suspect that gravitational lensing was at work . adopting h@xmath32 = 70  and @xmath33",
    ", the redshift of j0134 - 0931 implies that @xmath34 even before dereddening . in the absence of lensing",
    ", it would be one of the most luminous objects in the universe .",
    "the morphological similarity of the nirc k-band image and the vla 3.6 cm map virtually confirms that gravitational lensing is at work .",
    "early in our analysis of j0134 - 0931 , we became aware of the independent work of winn et al .",
    "( 2001a ) showing that j0134 - 0931 is a 5-component radio source , which they also interpreted as due to lensing . to explore the lensing nature of this object further and to compare the infrared and radio morphologies , we deconvolved our nirc @xmath20-band image of j0134 - 0931 using a variety of techniques .",
    "all produced qualitatively similar results ; here we discuss those from the maximum entropy task mem in iraf .",
    "the deconvolved image is shown in figure  5 as greyscale , smoothed to reduce the pixelation , and has an effective resolution of @xmath35 ( 2 pixels ) .",
    "the deconvolution breaks component a into two peaks , a and b ( marked by crosses in figure  5 ) , perhaps with some associated extended structure at lower surface brightness .",
    "component d is consistent with a point source in our @xmath20 image .",
    "a fainter and much less certain source , e , lies to the northeast , plus a hint of excess flux remaining between components a and d.    we next used the difmap package ( shepherd 1997 ) to map and fit models to the archival vla data .",
    "a check of the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) shows that j0134 - 0931 is a gigahertz - peaked spectrum ( gps ) radio source , and therefore we expect the dominant emission regions to have a small size compared to the vla beam ( odea , baum & stanghellini 1991 ) , so we fit models consisting only of point sources to the data .",
    "initially we used four point sources : three to account for the resolved brighter component , plus a fourth for component d. a fifth source , c , just to the se of the brightest component ( a ) was required to reduce the otherwise large residuals and to produce a reasonable fit to the high s / n data .",
    "these five sources account for 96% of the flux and there is no evidence for further discrete components in the residual map , to a limit of @xmath36mjy ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the resulting model is shown in figure  5 , convolved with a @xmath35 restoring beam to match approximately the resolution of the deconvolved nirc image ; the position of c is indicated by a black dot .",
    "the four components a , b , c , and e have fluxes of 346 , 84 , 79 , and 20 mjy respectively , while d is 65 mjy .",
    "these ratios are roughly 100 : 24 : 23 : 19 : 5.8 ( a through e ) .",
    "the radio positions and flux ratios are consistent with the more detailed , higher resolution results of winn et al .",
    "( 2001a ) .",
    "the radio and ir images in figure  5 have been placed on the same scale and registered using component d. there is good positional agreement for components a and b ; the nirc data suggest an object consistent with e , and at still lower significance there is a hint of another component roughly midway between a and d. better signal - to - noise and resolution are needed to test the reality of these fainter components .",
    "fitting psfs at the locations of the five radio components in the original @xmath20 image with daophot / iraf greatly reduces the residuals over the single psf a - component case , and significantly improves the fit over those with just two or even three components .",
    "the relative fluxes a : b : c : d : e are , roughly , 100 : 90 : 10 : 25 : 5 . using the cplucy deconvolution task iraf , we arrive at very similar flux ratios for the 5 component case , 100 : 90 : 14 : 26 : 6 . given the limited spatial resolution and depth of the @xmath20 data , the results of fitting five components is evidence only for a qualitative consistency between the radio and infrared images .",
    "the overall similarity of the @xmath20-band and 3.6 cm images leads us to conclude that j0134 - 0931 is gravitationally lensed , but the exact nature of the lensing is unclear .",
    "one possibility is a quadruple image , the 4 components being a , b , d , and e , though the latter is not unambiguously detected in the nirc images .",
    "component c , clearly detected in the radio and perhaps marginally needed to account for the 2@xmath38 flux , is difficult to interpret , but is perhaps structure in the quasar radio source and aligned optical emission .",
    "the observed mismatch between the radio and infrared images can be ascribed to insufficient resolution and signal - to - noise of the @xmath24-band data , real optical / radio morphology differences among the components , or even variability of the radio source .",
    "one obvious discrepancy between the radio and infrared is the relative brightness of a and b ; though comparable at 2@xmath38 , there is a factor of 4 difference at 3.6 cm . in support of the @xmath20 result ,",
    "similar analysis with cplucy and daophot of the somewhat lower resolution ( 05 ) nirc @xmath19-band image finds that b is at least 80% as bright as a. at the same time , the flux ratio of the sum of the close components ( a , b , c , e ) to component d is remarkably similar at 3.6 cm ( 8.1 ) and @xmath31 ( 8.0 ) especially given the brightness differences seen among the four closest components . in the @xmath19-band image",

    "( 2001a ) .",
    "the foreground galactic extinctions ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) are small in both cases ( table  1 ) .",
    "these colors are approximate given the uncertainties of the spectrophotometric calibration , but the extremely red observed spectral energy distributions of these objects are beyond question . a critical issue is whether the redness of these unusual objects is due to environmental effects local to the quasar or to intervening extinction somewhere along our line of sight .    the strong absorption features in the spectrum of j0738 + 2750 at the same redshift as the emission lines argue strongly that in this particular case , the reddening arises locally to the quasar .",
    "the intervening absorption features are not particularly strong ; many quasars with similar intervening systems are not noticeably reddened ( white et al .",
    "the strong polarization ( figure  1 ) , indicative of large amounts of local scattering , is also strong evidence that reddening by dust is responsible for the atypical spectral energy distribution of this object .",
    "sprayberry & foltz ( 1992 ) have found that bal quasars are intrinsically redder than non - bal quasars , so even the modest  bal ( figure  1 ) is consistent with local reddening in j0738 + 2750 .",
    "determining the origin of the redness of j0134 - 0931 is more difficult .",
    "there are no prominent absorption lines in the optical spectrum and the gravitational lens interpretation raises the real possibility of intervening reddening and extinction .",

    "2000 ) .",

    "figure  6 compares j0738 + 2750 with the result of reddening the composite spectrum by @xmath45 , assuming the reddening occurs in the quasar frame .",
    "the 2mass photometry points were not used to constrain the fit because of the uncertainty of the scaling between the slit spectroscopy flux calibration and the ir aperture photometry , which we estimate to be 10 - 30% . given the uncertainties of applying the smc reddening in this environment , the fit is reasonably good over the range covered by the keck spectrum , and fits the 2mass points within the overall scaling uncertainty .",
    "there is a continuum slope mismatch at longer wavelengths , perhaps because of a real difference between the intrinsic unreddened continuum of j0738 + 2750 and the quasar composite .",
    "the observed turndown is a general characteristic of a reddened power law spectral energy distribution ( francis , whiting , & webster 2000 ) . adjusting the redshift of the extinction to the intervening absorber system at 1.424 leads to a slight improvement in the fit over the region covered by the lris spectrum , but the fit is the ir is significantly worse .",
    "there is evidence for excess light in j0738 + 2750 compared to the reddened quasar spectrum at short wavelengths ( @xmath46 ) , which is probably scattered quasar light , though a contribution from young stars in the host galaxy can not be ruled out .",
    "based on the high polarization and the overall consistency of the reddening fits , we conclude that j0738 + 2750 is reddened by dust local to the quasar .",

    "this is not compelling , given that the same is true for j0738 + 2750 where the polarization points conclusively to dust in the quasar environment . lacking additional evidence , such as polarization measurements or absorption features in the spectrum ,",
    "we conclude that our present data are consistent with dust reddening of j0134 - 0931 , but the redshift of the dust is unconstrained by the modeling .",
    "the existing circumstantial evidence is equally ambiguous as to the location of the reddening of j0134 - 0931 .",
    "gps sources like j0134 - 0931 frequently occur in systems obscured by large amounts of gas and dust ( odea et al .",

    "a significant amount of dust associated with the interaction could account for the extreme red energy distribution of j0134 - 0931 .",
    "if j0134 - 0931 is a merger or interacting system with large amounts of dust , then the difficulty in consistently interpreting its ir and radio morphology ( see also winn et al .",

    "our results are somewhat less certain in the case of j0134 - 0931 .",
    "the lack of strong absorption features in its spectrum suggests that if the lens is dusty , then it must be at a low enough redshift to place telltale absorption features far enough into the blue that they are undetected in our spectrum . with the presently available information",

    "( 1997 ) have shown that a similar color dichotomy exists for the known lensed quasars .",
    "optically - discovered lensed quasars have broad band colors consistent with the general quasar population , typically @xmath55 , while radio - discovered lensed quasars span a much wider and redder color range , @xmath56 having @xmath57 , including one of the reddest extragalactic objects known , mg  0414 + 0534 with @xmath58 ( lawrence et al .",

    "( 1998 ) , francis et al.(2000 ) , and whiting et al .",
    "( 2001 ) argue that many of the red quasars in the sample of webster et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have intrinsically red spectra due to optical / near - infrared synchrotron emission from the radio jets in these relatively bright , flat - spectrum radio sources , but francis et al .",
    "( 2000 ) conclude that dust is necessary to account for a significant fraction of red quasars , amounting to @xmath62 of the total population .",
    "the 3crr sample of 173 quasars and galaxies ( laing , riley & longair 1983 ) contains a number of quasars which have colors significantly redder than the general population .",
    "as 3crr is selected at low radio frequencies , the beamed emission from the radio jet which can produce strong optical synchrotron emission is much reduced compared to the sample of webster et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and thus these quasar spectra are unlikely to have significant red optical synchrotron components .",
    "the fraction of quasars significantly reddened by dust in 3crr has been estimated by simpson et al .",
    "( 1999 ) as @xmath63% , larger than the fraction deduced by francis et al.(2000 ) , but with small number statistics producing the large error bars .",
    "most optical surveys for quasars rely on some form of blue color selection criterion , so it is not surprising that red quasars suffering large extinction should be missing from optically - selected samples .",
    "it is conceivable , however , that the radio - quiet quasar population simply has , for some reason , no red objects ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "j0738 + 2750 , although not radio - quiet , is radio - intermediate ( if the optical emission is dereddened ) , suggesting that this is probably not the case .",
    "evidence that such objects may be relatively common comes from identifications of chandra hard x - ray sources ( barger et al .",
    "2000 ) which find significant numbers of lightly - reddened quasars , and one example of a `` quasar-2 '' , in which the broad line region is completely hidden by dust ( norman et al .",
    "similarly , using an objective prism survey and rosat data , risaliti et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have identified quasars with anomalously low soft x - ray fluxes , indicating a significant absorbing column , and find that these quasars are significantly redder in the optical than the general population .",
    "all of these results suggest that there is a substantial population of radio - quieter red quasars , and that the intrinsic color distributions of radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars may well be similar .",
    "the different color distributions of optical- and radio - selected lensed quasars documented by malhotra et al .",
    "( 1997 ) can be explained largely as a natural consequence of the above discussion  red quasars are missing from the optically - selected samples to begin with .",
    "two other factors enhance the numbers of red , radio - selected lensed quasars , explaining why malhotra et al .",
    "( 1997 ) find that the colors of radio - loud lensed quasars are even redder than those of the general radio - loud unlensed population .",
    "first , a very dusty lensing galaxy can significantly redden the quasar light .",
    "this appears to be the explanation for the very red quasar pks1830 - 211 .",
    "the high differential reddening ( courbin et al .  1998 ) between the components of pks  1830 - 211 and the strong differential molecular absorption at an intervening redshift ( frye , welch , & broadhurst 1997 ; menten et al .",
    "1999 ) is near - conclusive evidence that the responsible dust is in the lensing galaxy and that the color differences are not intrinsic to the source or due to microlensing effects ( courbin et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the second factor contributing to the high numbers of red radio - selected lensed objects is that lensing can magnify the host galaxy contributions , invariably redder than the quasar light .",
    "host galaxy starlight probably explains the very red colors of mg  1131 + 0456 and b  1938 + 666 ( kochanek et al .",
    "but hubble space telescope nicmos images and near - infrared spectra show that host galaxy contributions are negligible for the extremely red lensed quasar mg  0414 + 0534 ( lawrence et al .",
    "1995a ) , which has colors comparable to j0134 - 0931 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "although lawrence et al .  ( 1995a ) conclude from multicomponent spectral modeling that a dusty lens is responsible for the red color of mg  0414 + 0534 , the circumstantial evidence argues that the redness arises from dust local to the quasar .",
    "first , it is a gps source .",
    "there are also very strong low - ionization absorption features of  and  at the host redshift ( lawrence et al.1995b ) , much like the case of j0738 + 2750 discussed above , as well as 21 cm hi absorption with a column consistent with the observed reddening ( moore , carilli , & menten 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , the lensing galaxy seems to be a typical elliptical with a low dust content ( tonry & kochanek 1999 ) .",
    "the size of the quasar population which is reddened by dust local to the source can be estimated from the statistics of radio - discovered gravitationally lensed quasars .",
    "there are now roughly 18 to 20 gravitationally lensed quasars from various radio searches , including the jodrell bank - vla astrometric survey ( jvas , patnaik & narasimha 1993 ) , the cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class , phillips et al.2001 ) and winn et al .",
    "( 2000 ; 2001b , c ) . among these",
    "are the three extremely red objects pks  1830 - 211 ( courbin et al .",
    "1998 ) , mg0414 + 0534 ( hewitt et al .",
    "1992 ) and j0134 - 0931 ( winn et al .  2001a and",
    "this work ) . assuming that both j0134 - 0931 and mg0414 + 0534 are reddened by dust local to the quasar ,",
    "then @xmath62 of the radio - selected objects are intrinsically red quasars .",
    "if , however , j0134 - 0931 and mg0414 + 0534 are , along with pks  1830 - 211 , reddened by their lensing galaxies , the implication is that a potentially large number of gravitationally lensed quasars exists . as only @xmath65 of quasars are radio - loud , such a population will be @xmath66 times as large as the radio - loud lensed quasars . as",
    "dusty lenses are likely to be lower mass , late - type galaxies , the image separations will be small and extinction in the lensing galaxy can more than counteract any amplification of the quasar light ( bartelmann & loeb 1998 ) .",
    "such radio - quiet lensed objects are extremely difficult to discover at any wavelength .",
    "two possible explanations for the existence of intrinsically dust - reddened quasars are youth and orientation .",
    "both the gps and bal phenomena have been conjectured to occur early in the lives of quasars ( odea et al .",
    "1996 ; becker et al .",
    "the reddest quasars , exemplified by j0134 - 0931 and mg  0414 + 0534 , both gps sources , and j0738 + 2750 , with a bal feature , may thus be early evolutionary phases in the lives of quasars , when the agn is first activated or is refueled . furthermore , baker & hunstead ( 1997 ) , in a sample of quasars selected from the molongolo radio source catalogue found that the compact steep spectrum ( css ) quasars in their sample typically had redder than average optical spectra and higher balmer decrements . like gps sources , css sources",
    "are thought to be young , with source evolution proceeding from the gps through the css to the fully - developed frii stage ( de vries et al .",
    "1998 ) .    alternatively , within the context of `` unified schemes '' ( antonucci 1993 )",
    ", red quasars may represent objects whose quasar light is just grazing the dusty torus which hides the quasar nucleus of narrow - line agn .",
    "there are well - studied examples from the 3crr sample which suggest that youth and orientation are each partly responsible for the red quasar population : 3c190 is a css radio source in a spectacular merging host galaxy and so possibly a young quasar ( stockton & ridgway 2001 ) , whereas 3c22 and 3c68.1 have all the hallmarks of evolved radio sources at an angle to the line of sight roughly corresponding to the hypothesised torus opening angle of @xmath67deg .",
    "if j0134 - 0931 and mg0414 + 0534 are intrinsically red , then the statistics of lensed and unlensed radio - selected red quasars imply that @xmath68% of radio - loud quasars are significantly reddened by dust in the host galaxy .",
    "the case of j0738 + 2750 proves that there are at least some dust reddened quasars with radio luminosities less than the very high values typical of 3crr and jvas / class sources .",
    "if such intrinsically red objects exist in similar proportion to the radio - loud red quasars , then a substantial population of red , radio - quiet objects awaits discovery .",
    "the relative numbers of red quasars and their redshift distribution can set limits on the relative lengths of the red phase and its possible relation to the bal and gps phases",
    ".    if j0134 - 0931 and mg0414 + 0534 are reddened by dust in their lensing galaxies , however , then no large population of intrinsically red quasars exists .",
    "these objects , along with pks  1830 - 211 , have been discovered because they are @xmath69  jy radio sources .",
    "if they are red because of intervening material along the line of sight , then a substantial population of radio - quiet , red , gravitationally lensed systems remains undiscovered , perhaps in numbers 5 - 10 times as great as the radio - loud objects .",
    "their actual numbers are critical to the interpretation of the statistics of lensed quasars , bearing on fundamental issues of cosmology and the masses and evolution of intervening galaxies .",
    "quasar surveys utilizing 2mass and other ir catalogs will eventually build the statistics of the red quasar population , allowing these issues to be addressed definitively .",
    "it will be necessary to carry out much of the exploratory spectroscopy at infrared wavelengths to accurately gauge the numbers of the most extreme objects .",
