    "the heavy - fermion compounds ce@xmath15in@xmath3 ( @xmath16 : hocoga@xmath3-type tetragonal structure ) have been attracting much interest for a rich variety of physical properties originating from the interplay of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity .",
    "cerhin@xmath3 shows an antiferromagnetic ( af ) order below @xmath17 @xcite , whose structure is suggested to be a helical with an incommensurate ( ic ) propagation vector @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "it is found that applying pressure @xmath18 suppresses the ic - af state , and then induces the superconducting ( sc ) state above @xmath19 @xcite . in cecoin@xmath3",
    ", on the other hand , the sc state is observed below @xmath20 at ambient pressure@xcite . the sc and af states",
    "are revealed to be effectively controlled by magnetic field @xmath0 : applying @xmath0 generates the non - fermi - liquid state above sc critical field @xmath21 @xcite and the unconventional sc phase with the ic - af modulation just below @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "these features are considered to occur due to the af correlations enhanced in the vicinity of the af quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "the relationship between the af and sc phases has first been investigated in cerh@xmath1co@xmath2in@xmath3 by thermodynamic and transport measurements @xcite .",
    "it is found that @xmath22 of the ic - af order is weakly reduced by increasing @xmath23 , and then approaches zero at the qcp : @xmath24 . at the same time",
    ", the sc phase develops above @xmath25 .",
    "the proposed @xmath26 phase diagram is similar to the @xmath27 phase diagram for pure cerhin@xmath3 .",
    "recent neutron scattering experiments revealed that a commensurate ( c ) af order with a modulation of @xmath10 appears in the intermediate @xmath23 range @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have observed that the @xmath28 modulation changes into @xmath11 at @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that the nature of the af correlation varies by doping co , and it may significantly affects the evolution of the sc order . to elucidate magnetic instability involved in small and rich co concentrations",
    ", we have investigated the magnetic - field dependence of the af structure for cerh@xmath1co@xmath2in@xmath3 by performing the elastic neutron scattering experiments .",
    "single crystals of cerh@xmath1co@xmath2in@xmath3 were grown by the in - flux technique , and they were cut into rod shape ( @xmath30 ) along the @xmath4 $ ] axis . in accordance with the previous investigations @xcite ,",
    "the rh / co concentrations @xmath23 in the samples were checked by means of the electron probe microanalysis ( epma ) measurements , and we adopt the @xmath23 values estimated from the epma measurements in this study . the elastic neutron scattering ( ens ) experiments for @xmath31 and 0.7 were performed on the triple - axis spectrometers issp - gptas ( 4 g ) and issp - ponta ( 5 g ) located at the research reactor jrr-3 m of jaea , tokai .",
    "we selected a neutron momentum @xmath32 by pyrolytic - graphite ( pg ) monochromator and analyzer , and used a combination of 40-40-40-80 collimator and two pg filters .",
    "the samples were cooled down to 1.6 k in a pumped @xmath33he cryostat with a superconducting magnet .",

    "was observed at zero field @xcite . both position and intensity of these bragg peaks",
    "are unchanged under @xmath0 smaller than @xmath40 . at 2 t",
    ", the ic - af bragg peak suddenly moves toward a commensurate position , accompanying a slight reduction of the peak intensity ( inset of fig .",
    "this indicates an occurrence of a c - af phase with a propagation vector of @xmath41 above 2 t , separated from the @xmath28-af phase via a first - order transition .",
    "since the same transition is also observed in pure cerhin@xmath3 @xcite , the magnetic properties are considered to be unchanged for the small amount of co doping .    for @xmath14 ,",
    "the application of @xmath0 induces commensurate af state which are different from that observed for @xmath9 .",

    "these bragg - peak positions do not change in this transition .",
    "we suggest that this transition is also of the first order , although in the present experimental accuracy the hysteretic behavior is not detected in the @xmath0 variations of the bragg - peak intensities . the total intensity of the these af bragg peaks is roughly conserved in the present @xmath0 range .",

    ", scaledwidth=60.0% ]    displayed in fig .",
    "2 are the @xmath50 phase diagrams for @xmath31 and 0.7 obtained from the temperature and field scans for the af bragg - peak intensities . for @xmath31 , the onset of the bragg peaks for the @xmath28-af order @xmath45 slightly increases from @xmath51 at @xmath6 with increasing @xmath0 . at 1.6 k",
    ", on the other hand , the c @xmath52-af phase appears above @xmath53 .",
    "the boundary between these af phases estimated from the onset of the @xmath52-af order @xmath54 is extended to high @xmath0 and @xmath55 region , and shows a tendency to be parallel with the @xmath56 line .",
    "this @xmath50 phase diagram is quite similar to that for pure cerhin@xmath3 @xcite . in cerhin@xmath3",
    ", an another phase boundary is found at the inside of the @xmath28-af phase , which can be detected by ens as a slight variation of the af bragg - peak intensity .",
    "however , in the present measurement we can not verify the presence of such boundary for very weak signal from the sample .    for @xmath57 , the onsets of the bragg - peaks for the @xmath44- and @xmath12-af states ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) are nearly constant at @xmath58 and @xmath59 below @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "they show weak enhancements with further increasing @xmath0 . above @xmath61 , @xmath47",
    "is slightly reduced , and @xmath62 can not be determined due to the reduction of the @xmath44-af bragg peak intensities . finally , for @xmath63 the @xmath44-af state completely vanishes and @xmath47 becomes again independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0 range of @xmath47 being enhanced seems to match with that for the @xmath0-induced variation of the af structure at 1.6 k. to obtain precise information on the phase boundaries , we plan to perform the magnetization and specific heat measurements under @xmath0 .",
    "we have observed that four different af structures corresponding to the wave vectors of @xmath28 , @xmath44 , @xmath12 , @xmath52 appear by changing @xmath23 and @xmath0 in cerh@xmath1co@xmath2in@xmath3 .",
    "the evolutions of such various modulations along the @xmath64 axis are expected to be basically attributed to the two - dimensional characteristics of these compounds . at the same time",
    ", it is remarkable that the af structure with the modulation of @xmath28 are favored in the small @xmath23 concentrations , while those with @xmath12 and its neighbor are stabilized as @xmath23 approaches @xmath65 .",
    "similar feature is also seen in the @xmath0 variations of the af structures : under @xmath0 the @xmath52-af phase occurs in the small @xmath23 range , while @xmath12-af phase develops at @xmath66 . in most of heavy - fermion systems showing quantum critical behavior , it is considered that enhancement of quantum fluctuation near qcp is ascribed to the suppression of the af order . since the qcp is expected to exist at @xmath65 in cerh@xmath1co@xmath2in@xmath3 , the change in the afm order seen in the present experiment close to @xmath65 of 0.7 should be accompanied with fluctuations at the same @xmath67 .",
    "recent de haas van alphen experiments for cerh@xmath1co@xmath2in@xmath3 revealed a dramatic change in the topology of the fermi surface at a much smaller @xmath23 than @xmath65 @xcite , which is expected to be connected with the variations of the af structure presently observed .",
    "our ens experiments under @xmath0 ( @xmath68 $ ] ) for cerh@xmath1co@xmath2in@xmath3 revealed that the @xmath0 variations of the af structure largely depend on @xmath23 : the application of @xmath0 changes the ic @xmath28 structure into the c @xmath52 one at @xmath31 , while it does the @xmath12 and @xmath44 modulations into the single @xmath12 one at @xmath57 .",
    "this suggests that the different types of the af correlations from those in pure cerhin@xmath3 are enhanced at around @xmath65 , presumably in connection with the variations of the fermi - surface properties with changing @xmath23",
