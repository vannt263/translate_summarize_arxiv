    "kev even maximal mixing is allowed .",
    "however , no detailed treatment of the sn bound exists for @xmath13 , where matter and resonance effects are important  @xcite . on the other hand , this is precisely the mass range where sterile neutrinos could play an interesting warm dark matter role in cosmology  @xcite . while sterile neutrinos can be produced in the early universe by different mechanisms @xcite ,",
    "the production by oscillations and collisions once more depends on the active - sterile mixing angle , so one naturally wonders about the sn bound on @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , we study the role of feedback of sterile neutrino emission on the emission rate itself .",
    "when matter effects are important , the mixing angle is resonantly enhanced in some range of neutrino energies  @xcite . at first the emission of @xmath5",
    "is more efficient than @xmath3 because in the neutrino sector the mixing angle is suppressed for all energies . as a consequence , the active flavor , being trapped in the sn core , builds up a @xmath14 excess .",
    "the opposite could happen for larger mixing angles , when most antineutrinos @xmath5 are trapped rather than freely escape and the emission of @xmath3 is more efficient than that of @xmath5 . to be specific we use @xmath2 as the active flavor because there is no initial @xmath2-@xmath4 asymmetry in a sn core and @xmath15 is so large that charged @xmath16 leptons never play any role .",
    "our main point is that the depletion of @xmath2 or @xmath4 relative to the other always goes in the direction of quenching the initial emission rate , implying that in the 1100  kev - mass range the @xmath7 bounds are indeed suppressed .",

    "it has been argued  @xcite that there exists a stationary state with @xmath80 , which can be achieved rapidly and thus validates the  vacuum limit \" and restrictive bounds on @xmath7 .    however , the state with @xmath80 can not be stationary , because the population of @xmath2 at this moment is larger than that of @xmath4 , implying that more neutrinos than antineutrinos are ready to be emitted and thus the condition @xmath80 breaks down .",
    "furthermore , it is even possible that the emission rate of @xmath3 exceeds that of @xmath5 , since the effective mixing angle @xmath72 can be so large that most of @xmath5 are trapped in the core . therefore one may obtain a negative asymmetry @xmath81 , driving the system towards the `` medium limit .

    "it deserves mention that the weak - damping limit is violated for smaller masses @xmath96 , however , the effective neutrino mixing angle in this case is highly suppressed by matter effects and thus the energy - loss rate is negligibly small .",
    "we shall always assume the weak - damping limit in the mass range of our interest .      in the weak - damping limit , @xmath86 is averaged over many cycles of oscillations and then can be parametrized by the neutrino occupation numbers @xmath97 and @xmath98 with the neutrino energy @xmath99 and similar for antineutrinos  @xcite .",
    "note that we consider a homogenous and isotropic ensemble of active neutrinos and antineutrinos , which are trapped in the sn core and stay in thermal equilibrium with ambient matter , so the momentum direction is irrelevant . assuming that sterile neutrinos freely escape",
    ", we obtain the evolution equation of the @xmath2 density @xmath100 where @xmath101 denotes the target particle , and @xmath102 the transition probability for @xmath103 via the neutral - current interaction . in a similar way",

    "since kev - mass sterile neutrinos are a promising candidate for warm dark matter , we have revisited the supernova bound on the sterile neutrino masses and mixing angles by studying the case of @xmath2-@xmath3 mixing in the sn core and requiring no excessive energy losses induced by sterile neutrinos .",

    "the build - up of this asymmetry feeds back on the emission rates , leading to a stationary state where the neutrino and antineutrino emissions become equal . for proper mixing angles ,",
    "such a stationary state can be achieved within the neutrino diffusion timescale @xmath160 . as a consequence , the energy - loss rate will be significantly reduced , and thus the bounds are relaxed .    as for the @xmath19-@xmath3-mixing case ,",

    "however , the charged - current interactions of @xmath19 and @xmath194 should be taken into account , and the change of @xmath19-@xmath194 asymmetry will be redistributed between muon neutrinos and charged muons .",
    "the @xmath9-@xmath3 mixing in sn cores is more involved because of the large trapped electron number and high @xmath9 degeneracy . besides energy loss , deleptonization by sterile neutrino emission is an effect to be taken into account",
