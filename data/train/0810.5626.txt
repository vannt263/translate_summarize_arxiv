    "for example , improving the physical failure probability may lead to better threshold failure probability by allowing some of the underlying operations to be weighted against one another . similarly improving the threshold failure probability , may require choosing a more efficient quantum error correcting code which may have fundamentally shorter logical time .",
    "the 1-d tim ground state energy can be efficiently computed using classical computing resources by taking advantage of the linear geometry of the spin configuration and significantly reducing the effective state space to a polynomial in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a 2-d tim with ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ising couplings can be difficult to solve due to spin frustration .",
    "many reductions to this problem still yield an exponential number of states with near degenerate energy @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the problem size scales exponentially with the size of the lattice .",
    "in contrast , the implementation of the quantum phase estimation circuit in figure  [ fig : onecontrolqubit ] is largely independent of the geometry of the @xmath0 spin states and the values of @xmath170 and @xmath171 , which suggests that it can be used for implementing efficiently higher - dimensional tim problems .",
    "consider , for example , the calculation of the ground state energy for the 2-d villain s model @xcite using the phase estimation circuit .",
    "villain s model is a 2-d square lattice ising model with @xmath172 spin sites in which the rows have all ferromagnetic coupling and the columns alternate between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic .",
    "each of the @xmath172 sites in villain s model are represented by @xmath172 qubits in a @xmath173 grid .",
    "the only change to the circuit for the phase estimation algorithm is the application of @xmath174 ising interaction , which must be decomposed into two successive steps .",
    "first the rows of spin states are treated as the 1-d tim problem in parallel , followed by the columns .",
    "since the @xmath174 operations within each step are done in parallel , we still require @xmath175 additional qubits for the cat - states .",
    "given that the remaining operations , including the quantum fourier transform implementation , remain the same , the increase in the number of time steps to implement an @xmath172-spin 2-d tim problem , compared to the 1-d tim problem , is by less than a factor of two .",
    "similarly , the increase in the resource requirements between a 1-d and a 3-d tim problem will be by less than a factor of three .",
    "since the qla architecture was initially evaluated in the context of shor s quantum factoring algorithm @xcite , it would be interesting to consider how the resource requirements for implementing the tim problem compare to those for implementing the factoring algorithm . in this section",
    ", we compare the implementation of the two applications on the qla architecture and highlight some important differences between each application .",
    "even though both applications employ the phase estimation algorithm , there are several important differences .",
    "first , the precision requirements are different . for shor s quantum factoring algorithm ,",
    "the precision @xmath22 must scale linearly with the size @xmath0 of the @xmath0-bit number being factored @xcite , where @xmath176 for modern cryptosystems . for quantum simulations , the desired precision is independent of the system size n , and the required m is small compared to factoring .",
    "the second difference lies in the implementation cost of the repeated powers of the controlled-@xmath40 gates for each application . in shor",
    "s algorithm , the gate is defined as @xmath177 .",
    "higher order powers of the unitary can be generated efficiently via modular exponentiation @xcite .",
    "the result is that the implementation of @xmath41 requires @xmath178 times the number of gates used for @xmath40 . for generic quantum simulation problems ,",
    "the implementation cost of @xmath41 equals @xmath179 times @xmath40 , because of the trotter parameter @xmath67 .",
    "the implementation of the control unitary gates for quantum simulation is not as efficient as that for the modular exponentiation unitary gates .",
    "the third difference lies in the preparation of the initial @xmath0-qubit state @xmath37 .",
    "the preparation of @xmath37 for the tim problem by adiabatic evolution is comparable in resource requirements to the phase estimation circuit . for shor s quantum factoring algorithm @xmath180 in the computational basis and is easily prepared",
    ".     corresponds to decimal precision of @xmath181 digits , respectively .",
    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    finally , factoring integers large enough to be relevant for modern cryptanalysis requires several orders of magnitude more logical qubits than the scale of quantum simulation problems considered in this paper . at minimum ,",
    "the factoring of an @xmath0-bit number requires @xmath182 qubits , using the same one - control qubit circuit given in figure [ fig : onecontrolqubit ] @xcite .",
    "as shown later in this section , however , choosing to use only the minimum number of qubits required for factoring leads to very high error correction overhead .",
    "a more reasonable implementation of the factoring algorithm requires @xmath183 number of logical qubits , which corresponds to millions of logical qubits for factoring a @xmath111-bit number .",
    "quantum simulation problems require significantly less computational space and the problems considered in this paper require less than @xmath184 logical qubits .",
    "we examine how these differences affect the relative size of the qla architecture required to implement each application . in particular , figure [ fig : testplot ] shows the performance of qla - based quantum computers in kq space with fixed physical resources .",
    "each horizontal line corresponds to the kq limit for a qla - based architecture modeled for factoring a @xmath111-bit number ( top - most horizontal dashed line ) , a @xmath185-bit number , a @xmath186-bit number , and an @xmath187-bit number , respectively .",
    "the physical resources for each qla - n quantum computer ( where @xmath188 bits ) are determined by how many logical qubits at level @xmath113 error correction are required to implement the quantum carry look - ahead adder ( qcla ) factoring circuit @xcite , which requires @xmath183 logical qubits and @xmath189 logical cycles .",
    "the plateaus in each qla-@xmath0 line of figure [ fig : testplot ] represent using all of the qubits at a specific level of encoding , with the top - most right - hand plateau representing level @xmath115 .",
    "where the lines are sloped , the model is that only a certain number of the lower level encoded qubits can be used . once this reaches the number of qubits that can be encoded at the next level , the quantum computer is switched from encoding level @xmath190 to @xmath191 by using all the available level @xmath190 qubits .",
    "figure [ fig : testplot ] shows that a qla-@xmath0 quantum computer is capable of executing an application using level @xmath190 encoded qubits if the application instance is mapped _ underneath _ the line representing the computer at level @xmath190 .",
    "factoring a @xmath111-bit number , for example , falls directly on the level @xmath113 portion of the qla-@xmath111 line ( see the square markers ) .",
    "anything above that line can not be implemented with the qla-@xmath111 computer .",
    "similarly , factoring a @xmath186-bit number maps under the qla-@xmath186 line , but can be accomplished using level @xmath115 qubits .",
    "the tim problem is mapped onto figure [ fig : testplot ] for @xmath192 , @xmath160 , @xmath193 and several binary precision instances : @xmath194 .",
    "as expected , factoring requires many more logical qubits , however , both applications require similar levels of error correction .",
    "a decimal precision of up to @xmath195 digits of accuracy ( @xmath196 ) can be reached by using a quantum computer capable of factoring an @xmath187-bit number at level @xmath113 error correction , however higher precision quickly requires level @xmath134 error correction .",
    "the resources for implementing quantum factoring with one - control - qubit were calculated following the circuit in figure [ fig : onecontrolqubit ] , where the unitary gates are replaced with the unitary gates corresponding to modular exponentiation , as discussed in reference @xcite .",
    "the results are shown with the diamond - shaped markers in figure [ fig : testplot ] .",
    "while this particular implementation is the least expensive factoring network in terms of logical qubits , the high precision requirement of @xmath197 makes this network very expensive in terms of time steps .",
    "in fact , the number of time steps required pushes the reliability requirements into level @xmath195 error correction for factoring even modestly - sized numbers .",
    "in this paper , the tim quantum simulation circuit was decomposed into fault - tolerant operations and we estimated the circuit s resource requirements and number of logical cycles @xmath105 as a function of the desired precision @xmath22 in the estimate of the ground state energy .",
    "our resource estimates were based on the qla architecture and underlying technology parameters of trapped ions allowing us to estimate both @xmath105 , as a function of the level of the error correction level , and the total length of the computation in real - time .",
    "our results indicate that even for small precision requirements @xmath105 is large enough to require error correction .",
    "the growth of @xmath105 is due to its linear dependence on the the trotter parameter @xmath67 , which scales exponentially with the maximum desired precision @xmath22 . in order for @xmath105 to scale polynomially with the precision ,",
    "new quantum simulation algorithms are required or systems must be chosen where the phase estimation algorithm can be implemented without the trotter formula . the linear dependence of the number of time steps on @xmath67 is due to the fact that @xmath198 and the @xmath174 do not commute .",
    "however , there are some physical systems , whose hamiltonians are composed of commuting terms , such as the nontransversal classical ising model , which has a solution to the partition function in two dimensions but is np - complete for higher dimensions@xcite . in those cases ,",
    "trotterization is unnecessary . in future work , we intend to generalize the calculations of the resource requirements to other physical systems and consider different ways to implement the phase estimation algorithm that limit its dependence on the trotter formula ."
