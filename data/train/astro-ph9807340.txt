    "rotation curves have been derived by optical and hi - line observations in order to study the mass distribution in the disk and halo of spiral galaxies ( rubin et al 1980 , 1982 ; @xcite ; kent 1986 , 1987 ; @xcite ) and of the galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "current optical observations for spiral galaxies have been devoted mainly to the study of massive halo and disk region , and , therefore , the spectra were often over - exposed in the central regions due to the bright stellar bulge light , not necessarily providing accurate data for the nuclear rotation curve .",
    "hi observations are useful for investigating the halo and total mass for its extended distribution , while they are also not necessarily useful to study the central few kpc region because of its deficiency .",
    "recently , we have shown that the co line emission will be useful to derive nuclear rotation curves because of the high central concentration of co gas and negligible extinction , as well as for the available high angular resolution ( sofue 1996 , 1997 ; sofue et al 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "we have found that the co rotation curves show steep nuclear rise within the central a few hundred pc , indicating a mass concentration around the nucleus . since the co gas usually coexists with hii regions , -line spectroscopy will be also useful to derive nuclear rotation curves , if the bulge light can be adequately subtracted and extinction is small enough .",
    "in fact , rubin et al ( 1997 ) have obtained extensive  spectroscopy for virgo spirals , and have shown a steep rise of the central rotation curves for many galaxies , indicating a mass concentration .    in order to derive detailed nuclear rotation curves for more number of galaxies and to examine",
    "if the steep nuclear rise of rotation is universal in spiral galaxies , we have performed optical spectroscopy of 22 spiral galaxies of sb and sc types using a 188-cm reflector .",
    "observed galaxies are listed in table 1 with their parameters .",
    "the ccd spectroscopic observations were made using the cassegrain spectrometer equipped on the 188-cm reflector at the okayama astrophysical observatory .",
    "the observations were carried out on 1997 february 28  march 6 , and october 2  8 .",
    "the original slit length was 5@xmath0 and was put across the nuclei and slit position angles were set along the major axes of galaxies .",
    "the photometrics ccd chip had @xmath1 pixels .",
    "the spatial resolution was @xmath2  pixel@xmath3 , and we have bin - ed every 2 pixels in order to increase the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath4  bin@xmath3 ) .",
    "the spectral dispersion was 0.767(velocity spacing of 34.9 ) per pixel .",
    "the slit width in the wavelength direction was 0.30 mm in order to get the best combination of effective spectral resolution , and signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "considering the slit width , the effective spectral resolution was 1.92a , which corresponds to a velocity resolution of 87.1 .",
    "this velocity resolution enabled us to determine the radial velocity at an error of about 9  ( @xmath5 times the resolution ) , if the signal - to - noise ratio is sufficiently high ( e.g. , @xmath65 rms noise ) .",
    "the exposure time was 1000 seconds per one spectrum , and we took three spectra for each galaxy , and finally combined them into one spectrum .",
    "therefore , the total exposure time for the final one frame was 3000 seconds .",
    "we have subtracted the stellar bulge continuum emission by applying two methods : ( 1)the background - filtering technique ( @xcite ) , ( 2 ) and a median - average subtraction in the wavelength direction , in the second method , we first obtained median value in the @xmath7 ( wavelength ) direction at each position ( pixel ) on the slit ( distance along the major axis ) .",
    "the median value in the @xmath7 direction gives an averaged value of the ccd counts of the stellar continuum emission , because the @xmath7 pixel number including line emissions is much less than that from the continuum part .",
    "both the methods , ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , gave almost the same results , while the latter was found to be better , when the emission lines are wide and strong , particularly in the central regions .",
    "threfore , we adopt the results from the median - average subtraction method .",
    "we have , then , subtracted the atmospheric lines , which showed no variation in intensity and wavelength along the slit .",
    "the upper two panels of figure 1 show the obtained position - velocity diagrams in the  and [ nii ] lines in a contour form , where the abscissa is the relative position in seconds of arc along the major axis .",
    "the velocity is heliocentric , referred to the  6562.8   and [ nii ] 6583.4  lines the contours are drawn in logarithm of base 2 , with the lowest contour level set at 3 counts .",
    "that is , each of the contours correspond to intensity levels of 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 48 , ... detector counts , respectively .",
    "the vertically - drawn dotted line indicates the position of the galaxy center , which is defined as being the intensity - peak in the light of bulge - continuum : we obtained a continuum - intensity distribution , i.e. , intensity ( counts ) as a function of position ( arcsec ) , at each wavelength .",
    "we thus determined the spatial position corresponding to the continuum - peak at this wavelength . repeating this procedure at",
    "all wavelength eventually yielded an ensemble of data , all of which may be the candidates of the central position of the galaxy .",
    "constructing a histogram based on these data , we could reasonably establish the position of the galaxy - center as the most frequent value .",
    "the length of the horizontal short bar crossing this center - line shows the actual ( physical ) scale on the galaxy corresponding to 2kpc ( i.e. , extension of @xmath8 kpc from the galaxy center ) , which was evaluated by using the redshift - based distance ( @xmath9 ) given in table 1 .    except for a few cases ,",
    "the pv diagrams are characterized by two components : a bright nuclear component with a large velocity gradient and/or dispersion , indicating a rapidly rotating nuclear disk , and a flat component showing a nearly - constant rotation in the disk and outer region .",
    "the lowest panels of figure 1 show the spectral profiles of the  and [ nii ] lines at individual positions on the major axis , drawn in the form of three - dimensional plot .",
    "the abscissa is the wavelength ( radial velocity ) and the ordinate is the distance along the major axis . for the purpose of background - smoothing , that helps to clarify the emission feature of present interest , any value ( irrespective of positive or negative ) below the threshold level of 3 counts was intentionally set to zero .",
    "these plots can be used to compare the line profiles of the and [ nii ] lines , whose shapes show complicated variations near to the nucleus .    in the disk regions ,",
    "the -to-[nii ] line intensity ratio ( hnr ) is usually equal to about three , which is typical for hii regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the two lines show almost the same profiles .",
    "the  line profile of the nuclear component often shows a double - horn feature , representing an unresolved rotating disk .",
    "however , the nuclear  emission is sometimes superposed by a broad stellar absorption lines , likely due to the balmer wing of a - type stars , such as in the case of ngc 3521 , in which no emission feature is recognized any more , being merged by a broad , strong absorption .",
    "some galaxies like ngc 5033 shows superposition of a broad seyfert emission feature on the  line .",
    "thus , the  pv diagrams and line profiles very close to the nucleus are often deformed from the pure emission features , which may cause pseudo kinematical properties . on the other hand",
    ", the [ nii ] line is not affected by such a stellar absorption feature or by the seyfert broad emission , though the signal - to - noise ratio is poorer than the  line by a factor of a few .",
    "considering that the reconstruction processes of the  p - v diagram contains uncertainty , it may be more safe to use [ nii ] line in the very central regions where the lines have enough signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "first , we derive velocity curves using the centroid of wavelengths of h-@xmath10 6563 and [ n",
    "ii ] 6583 emission lines at each spatial position . fig .",
    "2 shows the results , where the closed circles indicate data for h - alpha 6563 , and open circles for [ n ii ] 6583 line .",
    "the vertical dotted - line and the horizontal bar have the same meaning as in the case of contour diagrams in figure 1 .",
    "we define radial velocitis as follows : in a one - dimensional spectrum @xmath11 at each spatial position @xmath12 , with @xmath13 being the intensity , @xmath14 wavelength or pixel number in the direction of dispersion , the position of emission peak @xmath15 , which is defined as that satisfying the following conditions simultaneously , was detected automatically by using a small program .",
    "( i ) @xmath16 and @xmath17 and @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "( ii ) @xmath20 is above the ( assumed ) threshold level of 5 counts .",
    "such determined peak position can be directly converted to the ( peak ) radial velocity .",
    "however , the resulting plots were unsatisfactory because of the finite size of pixels ; i.e. , something like discontinuously assembled line - segments , rather than a continuous curve .",
    "we decided , therefore , to use the centroid - wavelength instead of the peak - wavelength : once the peak wavelength position , @xmath15 , is established , it is easy to find the two wavelength positions corresponding to the half - maximum intensity @xmath21 by an appropriate interpolation .",
    "let these two values be @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( the inequality of @xmath24 holds ) , respectively .",
    "then , the centroid wavelength of the emission line is defined as the mean of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath25 ] .",
    "the rotation curve constructed by using the radial velocity corresponding to such mean - wavelength at half - maximum turned out to be more continuous and natural to eyes , which may thus be more preferable to the peak - velocity curve .",
    "we next derive rotation curves from the pv diagrams by applying the envelope - tracing method ( sofue 1996 ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the interstellar gas ( @xmath26 ) and the velocity resolution of observations ( @xmath27 ) are corrected for as the following : the correction for the finite velocity resolution @xmath28 ( full width of half maximum ) is given by @xmath29 ^ 2 ) .",
    "\\eqno(1)\\ ] ] here , @xmath30 is the velocity difference between the maximum - intensity velocity near the profile edge , and the half - maximum velocity ( half width of the intensity slope at the velocity edge ) .",
    "equation ( 1 ) implies that , if the original velocity profile of the source is sharp enough , the observed profile becomes the telescope velocity profile , so that the correction is equal to the velocity resolution ( @xmath31 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the velocity profile of the source is extended largely ( @xmath32 ) , the correction becomes negligible ( @xmath33 ) and the half - maximum velocity gives the rotation velocity .",
    "the terminal velocity @xmath34 is defined by a velocity at which the intensity becomes equal to @xmath35 on the pv diagrams .",
    "then , the rotation velocity is estimated by @xmath36/{\\rm sin}~i.\\eqno(3)\\ ] ] for the  and [ nii ] lines in the present observations , we take @xmath37 and @xmath38 . the error in estimating",
    "the rotation velocity is @xmath39  for regions with sufficient signal - to - noise ratio , e.g. , in the central regions and the disks .",
    "the obtained rotation curves for the  and [ nii ] data are shown in figures 3 with the abscissa in kpc .",
    "the inserted horizontal bar indicates the angular scale of 30@xmath40 on the sky .",
    "the distances to the galaxies have been adopted from table 1 , column 9 ( calculated by @xmath41 ) , except for galaxies with redshifts smaller than 200 , for which tully - fisher distances have been adopted from column 10 of table 1 .",
    "figure 4 plots all the obtained rotation curves in the same panel .",

    "ngc 5907 * : this is an almost perfect edge - on sc galaxy . the nuclear component is not visible because of the extinction by the foreground disk . the disk component shows a rigidly rotating pv feature at @xmath68 , beyond which the rotation is flat .",
    "this rigid - body - like behavior occurs , because we are looking at a ring in the disk , where the optical depth along the lines of sight becomes nearly equal to unity .",

    "the disk part is clearly traced in the  line , reaching a maximum at @xmath59 , beyond which the rotation is flat .",
    "the -to-[nii ] line intensity ratio ( hnr ) is equal to about three for normal hii regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this applies to the disk regions of the galaxies observed in this paper , where both the lines have shown almost identcal profiles with a constant line ratio .",
    "however , the  line profiles in the nuclear regions of some galaxies ( e.g. , ngc 3521 ) were found to be superposed by a broad stellar absorption line due to the balmer wing most likely by a type stars . in fig . 5",
    ", we compare the  and [ nii ] lines of ngc 3521 in a grey scale , in order to demonstrate how the  balmer wing affects the pv diagram of the nuclear region . in principle",
    ", this will happen to any galaxies , if their nuclear region contains a considerable number of a type stars such as due to starbursts .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we have useed the [ nii ] line for the central regions in place of  line .",
    "the forbidden [ nii ] line has some advantages for discussing the kinematics of the nuclear regions : it is not affected by the stellar absorption feature , and no particular correction for the difference in wavelength is necessary when used in place of , since both the lines suffer from an almost equal amount of interstellar extinction .",
    "the origin of the [ nii ] line emission is still unclear , either if it comes from diffuse regions around normal hii regions , or from a circum - nuclear ionized gas . in either case , however , its pv behavior will indicates the rotation of the nuclear gas disk , in so far as the [ nii]-emitting gas is gravitationally bound to the galaxy . in fact , this will be the case , because the sound velocity of [ nii]-emitting gas is of the order of @xmath70 , or the temperature @xmath71 k , the gas can not escape from the galactic center .",
    "some of the galaxies observed in this paper have been discussed in our recent paper on the co - line rotation curves ( sofue 1996 , 1997 ) . in most cases , the /[nii ] rotation curves",
    "are consistent with the co - line rotation curves .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the fact that the molecular clouds ( co ) and hii regions ( -emitting regions ) are tightly associated with each other , if optical extinction and absorption are not significant .",
    "however , in such galaxies like ngc 3521 , whose  line is strongly affected by the stellar balmar absorption wing , the  results are not necessarily coincident with the co results .",
    "in such galaxies , [ nii ] rotation curves are more consistent with the co data , which is indeed found to be the case for ngc 3521 ( sofue 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , [ nii ] line would be a better tracer of kinematics than -line for the central regions of galaxies .",
    "the present results are consistent with the recent study of rotation curves of virgo galaxies by rubin et al ( 1996 ) , who have shown that many galaxies have steeply rising rotation in the center , indicating rapidly rotating nuclear gas disks",
    ". however , the nuclear rotation curves derived from our ccd data are not necessarily consistent with the earlier  observations using photographic plates ( rubin et al 1982 ; mathewson et al 1992 ; persic et al 1996 ) , which usually showed a rigid - body increase of rotation velocity within a few kpc region .",
    "this is because of the difference in the dynamic range of observations , particularly in the central regions , where the bright bulge continuum affect the pv diagrams significantly : the earlier photographic data were often saturated in the central bulge regions , and also their interest was more in the outer flat part of rotation curves , but not in the inner details .",
    "[ [ steep - nuclear - rise - of - rotation - and - implication - on - the - inner - dynamics ] ] steep nuclear rise of rotation and implication on the inner dynamics ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    in our earlier paper ( sofue 1996 , 1997 ) we have shown that the steeply rising rotation curves are common to almost all spiral galaxies of types sb and sc , including sbb and sbc , for which high resolution co data are available .",
    "such steeply - rising co rotation in the central region has been also suggested for many southern galaxies ( bajaja et al 1995 ) .",
    "it has been also found in many virgo spirals by the recent  spectroscopy ( rubin et al 1997 ) .",
    "this applies also in the present study , and our ccd  observations confirm these results .",
    "this fact indicates that the mass distribution in the central a few hundred parsecs is more steeply increasing toward the nucleus than expected for an exponential - law surface - mass distribution .    by definition ,",
    "a rotation curve is the trace of terminal velocities in the position  velocity diagram along the major axis .",
    "the assumption of axisymmetry and circular rotation has been extensively adopted in deriving the mass of galaxies , including hypothetical dark halos .",
    "the thus derived mass and potential have been used widely to discuss the dynamics of galactic disks , such as the resonance and density waves . in many studies ,",
    "however , the rotation curve for the central a few kpc has been assumed to be rigid - body like .",
    "_ resonance _ : if we adopt such steeply rising rotation curves in place of the widely assumed rigid rotation , dynamical as well as magnetohydrodynamical analyses of the central a few kpc region would be significantly affected . since the epicyclic frequency , @xmath72 , gets minimum in a rigidly rotating disk ,",
    "no resonance with the orbital rotation occurs , where @xmath73 is the rotation frequency .",
    "the resonance will occur at a radius , where the rotation curve turns from rigid to flat , and the interestellar gas tends to be accumulated to make a ring of this turn - over radius . on the other hand , if the rotation curve is not rigid but rather flat or even declining , as often found in sharply peaking rotation curves , this resonance ring occurs at a much smaller radius .",
    "hence , often quoted inner rings of radii a few hundre pc to a kpc may not occur in such galaxies having sharply rising rotation curves .",
    "in fact , many galaxies appear to have not necesarily a ring structure within the central 1 kpc region : we can trace the outer spiral patterns continuously toward the very nuclear region .",
    "_ dynamo _ : if we adopt the steeply - rising rotation curves , some results on the galactic magnetic fields ( e.g. , sofue et al 1986 ) based on the dynamo theory would be significantly changed for the central regions .",
    "the dynamo action depends on the shearing motion of gas from a radius to another . if the rotation is rigid , the shearing motion is minimized , so that the dynamo does not work , resulting in a weak or no magnetic fields in the inner a few kpc region .",
    "if the rotation is flat or declining , the shearing motion is more significant and the dynamo action will be more effective , resulting in a strong magnetic fields within the inner kpc region .      if a galaxy contains a bar , it is not straightforward to derive the mass distribution using the rotation curves .",
    "since dense molecular gas clouds and hii regions are associated with shock - compressed gas lanes along the bar , where the orbital velocity of gas is lowest , their staying probability is highest along the shocked gas lane . on the other hand ,",
    "the probability is lowest when the gas clouds orbit in the inter - bar regions , where the velocity is highest and nearly parallel to the bar .",
    "therefore , the observed gas clouds and hii regions are most likely observed to exist in the shocked gas lane , which is rotating nearly at the pattern speed of the bar .",
    "this means that the apparent rotation velocities may be underestimated compared to the circular velocity , if the galaxy has a bar .",
    "therefore , the presently discussed galaxies would have still steeper nuclear rise of rotation , if they have bars .",
    "analysis of rotation curves taking into account the effect of a bar is , however , beyond the scope of the present study : the data are still too crude to discuss the bar , for which we need to determine such a large number of parameters like the mass of the bar , its three axes lengths , orientation of the bar axes with respect to the line of sight , and the shocked gas motion .",
    "therefore , we stress that the present analysis of rotation curves on the assumption of an axi - symmetry can give only a first - order approximation of the mass distribution possibly still under - estimated .",
    "_ dwarf and small - mass galaxies _ : we have seen that a large number of galaxies have steeply rising rotation curve in the central a few kpc region .",
    "these steep rises are seen both in h@xmath74 and in nii , as long as h@xmath74 is not absorbed significantly , as well as in co. however , there are some exceptions which show rather slowly rising rotation curves in co , such as in the case of m33 ( sofue 1997 ) . in the present sample ,",
    "ngc 1003 , ngc 2403 and ngc 4605 have such rotation curves in  in the centeral regions . as for ngc 2403 , the co rotation curve also shows a gentle slope in the central 5 kpc region .",
    "therefore , not every galaxy shows the nuclear steep rise .    from figures 3 and 4 ,",
    "one can see that galaxies with gentle rises have smaller disk rotation velocity than those with steep nuclear rises .",
    "in fact , the maximum rotation velcity of ngc 2403 is about 130 km / s , and that of ngc 4605 is about 100 km / s , although it appears to be slightly rising at the observed outermost point . on the other hand ,",
    "galaxies with steep nuclear rise are likely to have the maximum rotation velocity of @xmath75 km / s or larger .",
    "also remarkable is that the galaxies with gentle rise do not have prominent bulges , and are classified as sc or later .",
    "therefore , the slope of nuclear rotation curves are probably correlated with the galaxies type and mass to some degree .",
    "these facts may indicate that less massive galaxies like dwarfs , which have neither prominent bulge nor massive core , are likely to show slowly - rising rotation in the nuclear regions , whereas bright galaxies with disk rotation velocity of @xmath76  or larger have steeply rising rotation curves , representing their massive bulge and cores .",
    "_ edge - on galaxies _ : the central regions of edge - on galaxies are obscured by the foreground dust in the disk : the observed rotation curves manifest the rotation of a ring region at which the optical depth through the line of sight becomes about unity . in these cases , the central steep rise of rotation",
    "may not be observed , but the derived curves show an apparently rigid rotation .",
    "examples are seen for ngc 3495 and ngc 5907 .",
    "ngc 4565 is also an edge - on galaxy , while showing a central rise and peak , which may be significantly underestimated .",
    "in fact , co - line observations , which does not suffer from interstellar absorption , shows a steep rise for these edge - on galaxies ( sofue 1997 ) .",
