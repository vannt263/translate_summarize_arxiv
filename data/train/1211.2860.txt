    "a variety of observations and simulations have shown that the density structures of the interstellar medium ( ism ) are scale - free , hierarchical , and fractal ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the supersonic , compressible turbulence is likely responsible for the complex and hierarchical density structures observed in the ism .",
    "the density fluctuation due to the supersonic turbulence plays a crucial role in models of star formation rates and initial mass functions @xcite .",
    "hence , the statistical properties of density structures in the turbulent ism have been extensively studied in hydrodynamic ( hd ) and magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations .",
    "it is now well known that the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) densities and column densities of the turbulent ism are close to lognormal @xcite .",
    "the standard deviation of density ( @xmath8 ) increases with sonic mach number , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this trend is expressed by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the density ( @xmath11 ) normalized by the mean density ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath7 is a constant of proportionality , known as the turbulence forcing parameter .",
    "values of @xmath7 ranging from @xmath13 0.3 to @xmath13 1.0 have been suggested in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "@xcite have found that for the same @xmath2 , compressive ( dilatational ) forcing leads to much larger density variance compared to solenoidal ( rotational ) forcing .",
    "they showed that @xmath7 depends on the type of the turbulence forcing varying from @xmath14 for solenoidal forcing to @xmath15 for compressive forcing .",
    "the density power spectrum is also a useful tool to characterize the turbulent ism .",
    "the power spectra of turbulent clouds are power laws in form @xcite . @xcite",
    "have investigated the dependency of the power - law slope of the density power spectrum on @xmath2 and found that the density spectrum becomes gradually shallower as @xmath2 increases in hd turbulent media . @xcite and @xcite confirmed the flattening of the density spectra with @xmath2 in mhd cases .",
    "@xcite showed that compressive forcing leads to significantly steeper density spectra than solenoidal forcing .",
    "we note that the spectral slope of the 3d density power spectrum is the same as that of the projected column density power spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the 3d density is not an observationally accessible quantity , but instead the column density , i.e. , the integral of the density along a line of sight , is observable .",
    "there is a great deal of observational data , which traces the ism column density , from surveys .",
    "some examples are the galfa @xcite and gaskap @xcite surveys and columbia - cfa @xcite and thrumms molecular gas surveys .",
    "the best way to infer the variance of the 3d density field from observations is obviously to compare the observational data with a large number of turbulence simulations .",
    "however , instead of performing expensive simulations , a simpler approach to derive the 3d density variance would be of great interest .",
    "@xcite generated random density distributions with various density variances and spectral slopes and compared the resulting synthesized extinction maps with the observed extinction data .",
    "@xcite developed an interesting technique for calculating the variance of a 3d density field using only information contained in the two dimensional projection .",
    "the technique has been applied to the taurus molecular cloud @xcite .",

    "the ratio of @xmath29 to @xmath24 becomes smaller for a shallower @xmath27 .",

    "however , @xmath27 and @xmath24 are not independent in the real turbulent media , but rather depend on @xmath2 .",
    "if we ignore magnetic fields , the statistical properties are uniquely determined by @xmath2 and @xmath7 .",
    "we therefore need to specify the dependencies of @xmath27 and @xmath24 on @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite combined the results of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and obtained a simple relation between @xmath2 and @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath61 , which may be applicable to solenoidal forcing .",
    "the power spectra of the compressively driven turbulence are considerably steeper than those of the solenoidal forcing .",
    "the spectral slopes at @xmath62 2.3 and 5.6 for compressive forcing are provided by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , and are @xmath63 0.6 larger than the values for the solenoidal case .",
    "we therefore assume that @xmath64 for the compressive mode .",
    "there are two transverse ( solenoidal ) and one longitudinal ( compressive ) wave mode in the 3d space .",
    "therefore , the solenoidal and compressive forcing would be mixed with a ratio of 2:1 if no preferential forcing mode were provided @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum of this natural mixing mode might be obtained by adding two power spectra for solenoidal and compressive forcing with a ratio of 2:1 .",
    "the resulting power spectrum is also represented by a power - law with a spectral slope , which is at most @xmath65 larger than the slope of the solenoidal case .",
    "we therefore assume the same spectral slope as the solenoidal forcing case for the natural mixing case .",
    "the density variance in logarithmic scale is obtained from the variance in linear scale using the property of a lognormal distribution , i.e. , @xmath66 .",
    "the forcing parameter @xmath7 is 1/3 , 0.5 , and 1 for solenoidal , natural mixing , and compressive modes , respectively @xcite .    using @xmath27 and @xmath24 as functions of @xmath2 , and equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) , we calculate @xmath29 for solenoidal , natural mixing , and compressive modes as functions of @xmath2 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig4 ] , wherein the upper three black - curves show @xmath29 as functions of @xmath2 for three different forcing types .",
    "we fitted the obtained curves with equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",

    "the best - fit curves are shown as dashed lines .    applying the expression relating @xmath27 and @xmath20 derived with the 128@xmath22 dataset",
    ", we also generated the lognormal density fields with a higher resolution of 512@xmath22 for @xmath67 0.5 , 1 , 2.5 , 5 , 10 , and 20 .",
    "for every combination of parameters ( @xmath7 , @xmath2 ) , we produced 30 realizations and calculated the ensemble average of @xmath29 and its statistical dispersion .",
    "circles and error bars in figure [ fig4 ] represent the ensemble averages and the dispersions , respectively , which closely follow the curves calculated with the 128@xmath22 dataset .",
    "we therefore conclude that the expressions obtained with a rather lower resolution of 128@xmath22 are also applicable to the higher resolution of 512@xmath22 .",
    "the error bars obtained with the 512@xmath22 resolution indicate the ranges of variation between realizations .    in figure [ fig4 ] , we over - plotted the data points obtained from the hd simulations with solenoidal ( blue squares ) and compressive forcing ( red squares ) modes of @xcite , who provide the standard deviations of linear column density ( @xmath68 ) and logarithmic column density ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the filled squares show the @xmath29 values that they directly measured with the logarithmic column density and the open squares represent the values @xmath69^{1/2}$ ] calculated with the standard deviations of the column density @xmath68 assuming that the column density pdf is a perfect lognormal distribution .",
    "the values estimated with the two different methods show a significant discrepancy , especially for compressive mode , indicating that the column density pdf is not a perfect lognormal ( see also @xcite for the discrepancies ) . indeed , the pdfs for compressive forcing show large departures from a perfect lognormal function @xcite . even with this departure from the perfect lognormal function , the present results are consistent with their results within the variation ranges denoted by error bars in the figure .    in the above analyses ,",
    "we have assumed hd cases .",
    "@xcite fitted the mhd simulation results for solenoidal forcing with equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) and obtained a best - fit @xmath4 of 0.11 , which is different from our result of @xmath70 .",
    "the difference might be attributable to the magnetic field effects .",
    "first , the density variance in magnetized gas is significantly lower than that in the hd counterparts @xcite .",
    "the effect could be mimicked by reducing @xmath7 below the value of the hd case , while assuming the same relationship between @xmath27 and @xmath2 for the hd case .",
    "we found that the @xmath21 relationship derived with @xmath71 is very close to the result of @xcite .",
    "second , the spectral slope of the strongly magnetized media appears to be shallower than those of unmagnetized or weakly magnetized media .",
    "@xcite found that the mhd model with approximate equipartition of kinetic and magnetic energies yields a shallower density power spectrum than the super - alfvnic model .",
    "the results of @xcite also provide some indications that the power - law slopes of the supersonic , sub - alfvnic models are slightly smaller than those of super - alfvnic models .",
    "their spectral slopes for the cases of a strong magnetic field are lower than the values expected from @xmath61 by amounts of @xmath72 .",
    "indeed , we could reproduce the best - fit curve of @xcite with a spectral slope of @xmath73 and @xmath57 . in a real situation",
    ", both effects may play roles together . therefore",
    ", we lowered both @xmath27 and @xmath7 and found that the results with @xmath59 and @xmath58 match the result of @xcite , as shown by the lowest black curve in figure [ fig4 ] . in the figure ,",
    "the black and blue dashed lines denote the best - fit results to equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) with @xmath58 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "@xcite presented @xmath27 as a function of @xmath2 for mhd simulations with different magnetic field strengths and found that the magnetic field effect on @xmath27 is more important at lower @xmath2 than at higher @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , we may need further investigations on the magnetic field effects .",
    "another aspect worth noting is that we can constrain the condition for equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) to hold , by varying the equation between @xmath27 and @xmath74 .",
    "for instance , in figure [ fig4 ] , we plotted the @xmath75 relationship by assuming a constant spectral slope of @xmath76 ( upper red curve ) for @xmath56 .",
    "it is obvious that the resulting curve can not be expressed by equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "as we assume @xmath27 increases with @xmath2 , we obtain more rapidly increasing curves than the red curve . on the other hand ,",
    "if we assume @xmath27 decreases more rapidly than @xmath61 with increasing @xmath2 , the resulting curve shows a much slower increase with increasing @xmath2 , as indicated by the lower red curve obtained for @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the necessary condition for equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) is that the spectral slope should moderately decrease as @xmath2 increases .",
    "we investigated the dependency of the column density variance on the 3d density variance and the power - law slope of the density power spectrum by using the fbm structures . adopting the spectral slopes and 3d density variances that are appropriate in the hd regime",
    ", we obtained the same relationship between the column density variance and the mach number as suggested by @xcite , but with a different scaling parameter @xmath4 .",
    "however , when the magnetic field effects were included , the parameter @xmath4 agreed with the mhd result of @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields prevent the turbulent gas from reaching very low densities as well as very high densities @xcite , and consequently have important implications for the models of the star formation rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the approach adopted in this letter is similar to that of @xcite in the point that they also use random density fields to derive the 3d density variance .",
    "the fbm structures also have been used to investigate the density structure of molecular clouds @xcite and the stellar initial mass function @xcite . note that @xcite neglected the dispersion in fourier amplitudes in generating gaussian random fields .",
    "we compared the cases of fixed fourier amplitudes with the results presented here , and found that the fixed amplitudes give rise to slightly stiffer spectral slopes than the present results .",
    "the present results can be applied directly to the observations to infer the 3d density variance from the observed column density variance and spectral slope .",
    "we can vary @xmath24 in equations ( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) to find the best - fit value that matches the observed @xmath29 . in applying the results ,",
    "we need to consider the effects of instrument noise and telescope smoothing",
    ". however , the inclusion of noise and smoothing may not severely affect the applicability of the results , as in @xcite .    the density fluctuation of the ism plays a crucial role in understanding the propagation of radiation .",
    "the intensity pdf of the dust - scattered starlight in far - ultraviolet was found to be lognormal , which might be caused by the density structure of interstellar dust @xcite .",
    "escape of the ionizing radiation field through the clumpy ism has been argued to be the origin of ubiquitous diffuse ionized gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this has not , however , been clearly confirmed using realistic ism density structures ( c.f .",

    "the present study provides a practical method to generate the realistic density structures for the radiative transfer problems ."
