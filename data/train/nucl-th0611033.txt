    "one of the main challenges in hadron physics is to understand within quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) the structure of the nucleon and its excited states . through their couplings with the meson - baryon continuum",
    ", these excited states may be identified with the nucleon resonances ( @xmath2 ) in various meson - baryon reactions .",
    "ideally , one would like to study the @xmath2 structure by analyzing the meson - baryon reaction data completely within qcd .",
    "this however is far from our reach . as a compromise",
    ", one can analyze meson - baryon reaction data by developing reaction models within which both the internal structure of hadrons and the reaction mechanisms are modeled using theoretical guidances deduced from our current understanding of qcd .",
    "of course , the separation between the reaction mechanisms and the internal structure of hadrons is by no means well defined theoretically .",
    "thus the model dependence of the interpretations of the extracted @xmath2 parameters is unavoidable .",
    "this is not very satisfactory , but seems to be the only option we have at the present time . with this understanding ,",
    "many models have been developed in recent years to analyze the very extensive electromagnetic meson production data which have been obtained by intense experimental efforts at jefferson laboratory ( jlab ) , mit - bates , legs , mainz , graal , bonn , and spring-8 . for a comprehensive review of the present experimental and theoretical status",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    "we focus on recent measurements of pion electroproduction at energies near the @xmath0 resonance , and in particular the data at @xmath3  2.00  ( gev / c)@xmath4 obtained at jlab  @xcite , mit - bates  @xcite and mainz  @xcite .",
    "one possible approach to analyze these data is to apply the dynamical model developed by sato and lee ( sl ) in refs .",
    "the sl model , as well as the unitary isobar model maid  @xcite , and the dubna - mainz - taipei ( dmt ) model  @xcite have been used extensively to extract the @xmath1 form factors from the data .",
    "the sl model gives reasonably good descriptions of the very extensive data accumulated since 2001 , using parameters obtained by analyzing the pion photoproduction data from legs  @xcite and mainz  @xcite , and the pion electroproduction data at @xmath5 ( gev / c)@xmath4 from jlab  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we would like to re - visit this model and to include the recent data  @xcite in a comprehensive analysis to extract more precisely the @xmath6 form factors .",
    "furthermore , we explore the theoretical interpretations of the extracted @xmath6 form factors in terms of two relativistic quark model calculations  @xcite and a recent lattice qcd calculation  @xcite .    in section",
    "ii , we recall the essential ingredients of the sl model and present a refinement of the model from improvement of fits to the @xmath7 scattering data .",
    "section iii is devoted to defining explicitly the @xmath1 transition form factors which are the focus of this work .",
    "the extraction of @xmath8 form factors from electroproduction data is discussed in section iv .",
    "we then discuss possible theoretical interpretations of the extracted @xmath8 form factors in section v. in section vi , we give a summary and discuss possible future developments .",
    "the essential feature of the sl model is to have a consistent description of both the @xmath7 scattering and the electromagnetic pion production reactions .",
    "this is achieved by applying a unitary transformation method  @xcite to derive an effective hamiltonian from the interaction lagrangians with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and photon fields .",
    "the details of the model can be seen in ref .",

    "( [ eq : rgpi ] ) is the mathematical consequence of the hamiltonian formulation of the reactions .",
    "it differs from the covariant forms , mainly used in tree - diagram models and extensively discussed in the literature on possible off - shell effects  @xcite .",
    "the investigations on which covariant form of the @xmath10 propagator is more consistent with the general principles of quantum field theory are continuing  @xcite .    by using eqs.([eq : nr - tpingn ] ) and ( [ eq : nr - tpinpin ] ) , one can write eq.([eq : f - dgn ] ) as @xmath27 where @xmath28 with @xmath29\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : f - dpin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we will discuss the dynamical content of the dressed vertices eqs.([eq : f - dgn - a])-([eq : f - dpin ] ) in section iii .    within the considered model",
    "the non - resonant @xmath7 potential @xmath19 contains four mechanisms : the direct and crossed nucleon terms , @xmath12 exchange , and crossed @xmath10 term .",
    "apart from the standard @xmath30 coupling constant , the model is determined by three coupling constants @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the @xmath12-exchange , @xmath33 for the @xmath34 vertex .",
    "each interaction vertex is regularized with a dipole form factor @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the pion momentum associated with the vertex .",
    "the model thus has additional three parameters : @xmath37 for the @xmath30 vertex , @xmath38 for the @xmath39 vertex and @xmath40 for both @xmath41 and @xmath42 vertices of the @xmath12-exchange term .",
    "these six parameters are adjusted along with the bare mass @xmath43 of the @xmath10 to fit the empirical @xmath7 scattering phase shifts .",
    "we note that this model has considerably fewer parameters than the other @xmath7 models used in the study of pion electroproduction calculations . for example",
    ", the @xmath7 model  @xcite used in the dubna - mainz - taipei ( dmt ) model of pion electroproduction has 16 parameters .",
    "thus we do not attempt to fit the data at energies above @xmath44 mev ( invariant mass @xmath45 mev ) . at higher energies",
    ", we expect that the coupling with the @xmath46 channel as well as the tails of higher mass @xmath2 , such as the @xmath47 and @xmath48 resonances , must be included in a realistic description of the @xmath49 scattering data .",
    "an extension of the sl model to higher energies has been developed recently in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the original sl model ( model l in ref .",
    "@xcite ) provides a quite good description of the @xmath7 scattering phase - shifts up to @xmath50 mev except in the @xmath51 partial wave .",
    "this can be seen from comparing the data with the solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : pshift ] .",
    "this discrepancy raised some questions concerning the stability of the results with respect to the @xmath7 fit . in this work , we find that the fit to @xmath51 phase shifts can be considerably improved while retaining a similar quality of fit in the remaining partial waves .",
    "this is done by weighting the data in @xmath51 slightly more heavily in the fit .",
    "the resulting fits are the dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : pshift ] . the fitted parameters for the new @xmath7 model ( sl2 ) and the original sl model in ref .",
    "@xcite are compared in table  [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "the remaining discrepancy in the @xmath52 channel at energies above @xmath53 mev perhaps can be resolved if we add additional mechanisms or use a different form factor parameterization .",
    "we have explored these possibilities and found that the model sl2 is the best we can have within the sl model .",
    "it should be noted here that due to the lack of energy independent solutions at lower energies in the @xmath51 and @xmath54 partial waves , we have instead used the said  @xcite energy dependent solutions and assigned those points with @xmath55 errors in the fits .",
    "a more correct procedure is to fit the original @xmath7 observables .",
    "this however is not pursued in this work .",
    ".parameters of the two considered models .",
    "the notations are explained in the text .",
    "[ tab : parameters ] [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]",
    "within the dynamical model of refs .  @xcite we have performed a comprehensive analysis of recent pion electroproduction data to extract more precisely the @xmath1 form factors .",
    "it is found that the predictions from the original sl model are not changed much by improving its fit to the @xmath7 phase shifts in @xmath51 channel .",
    "the fits to the very extensive @xmath56 electroproduction data near the @xmath10 position can be improved when the simple parameterization eqs.([eq : par-1])-([eq : par-2 ] ) is abandoned and the strengths of the bare form factors @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are adjusted at each @xmath60 where the data are available .    in using our results , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lqcd ] and table  [ tab:1 ] , to test hadron structure calculations , it is important to note that the differences between the dressed and bare @xmath8 form factors are from the meson loops illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cloud ] .",
    "we emphasize here that the parameters associated with these loops are the same as that in the non - resonant amplitude @xmath61 and @xmath62 which are important components in describing both the @xmath7 scattering phase shifts and pion electroproduction data .",
    "thus the meson cloud effect identified in this analysis is well constrained by the _ reaction _ data directly .",
    "such a direct connection with reaction data is very difficult to achieve in the current hadron model calculations , in particular the lattice qcd .    as an exploratory step ,",
    "we have considered two relativistic constituent quark model calculations of @xmath1 form factors .",
    "the predictions from both models differ significantly from the extracted dressed values , in particular in the low @xmath60 region . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : bff ] , their results for @xmath57 and @xmath58 qualitatively reproduce our bare values both in shapes and magnitudes .",
    "this seems to suggest that the hadron calculations without meson degrees of freedom could make contact with the _ reaction _ data through the bare from factors extracted from a dynamical analysis such as the one given in this work .",
    "the origin of the differences in the coulomb form factor @xmath59 seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : bff ] is not clear",
    ". it will be interesting to explore whether the parameters within both models can be refined to remove these discrepancies and also improve their results for the bare @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "it is still difficult to interpret the extracted form factors in terms the current lqcd calculations .",
    "the discrepancies shown in fig .  [ fig : lqcd ] indicate the need of a better understanding of the chiral extrapolation used in obtaining those results as well as a significant improvement in lqcd calculations .    to end this paper , we mention that the non - resonant amplitude @xmath61 , which is crucial in evaluating the meson cloud effects on the @xmath8 form factors , can be more sensitively determined in the energy region away from the @xmath10 position . while the sl model considered in this work can account for the data in the region of @xmath63  mev very well in most cases  @xcite , a more extensive analysis of the data away from the @xmath10 position must be performed in the near future when polarization data will also become more extensive .",
