    "the inverse problem consisting of mapping given noisy time - series to compatible reaction networks is of importance when the possible biological mechanisms underlying the time - series are of interest  @xcite .",
    "reaction networks compatible with given noisy time - series may be induced from the deterministic kinetic ordinary - differential equations ( odes ) which are compatible with the time - series  @xcite . however , in order to match suitable deterministic kinetic equations with given stochastic time - series , it is important to determine the type of the deterministic stable invariant sets which are ` hidden ' in the time - series .",
    "this may be a challenging task , especially when cycles ( oscillations ) are observed in the time - series .",
    "the observed cycles can be classified as mixed ( also known at the stochastic level as _ noisy deterministic cycles _ ) , which are present in both the deterministic and stochastic models , or as purely stochastic ( also known as _ quasi - cycles _ , or noise - induced oscillations ) , present only in the stochastic model .",
    "noisy deterministic cycles may arise directly from the autonomous kinetic odes , or via the time - periodic terms present in the nonautonomous kinetic odes .",
    "quasi - cycles may arise from the intrinsic or extrinsic noise , and have been shown to exist near deterministic stable foci , and even near deterministic stable nodes  @xcite . for two - species reaction systems",
    ", quasi - cycles can be further classified into those that are unconditionally noise - dependent ( but dependent on the reaction rate coefficients ) , and those that are conditionally noise - dependent  @xcite .",
    "thus , a cycle detected in a noisy time - series may at the deterministic level generally correspond to a stable limit cycle , a stable focus , or a stable node .    in order to detect and classify cycles in noisy time - series , several statistical methods",
    "have been suggested  @xcite .",
    "for example , in  @xcite , analysis of the covariance as a function of the time - delay , spectral analysis ( the fourier transform of the covariance function ) , and analysis of the shape of the stationary probability mass function , have been suggested , first two of which rely on how long the stochastic state spends near the suspected cycle , which can be a limitation if stochastic switching is present .",
    "let us note that reaction networks of the lotka - volterra type are used as test models in  @xcite , and that conditionally noise - dependent quasi - cycles , which can arise near a stable node , and which can induce oscillations in only a subset of species  @xcite , have not been discussed .",
    "in addition to the aforementioned statistical methods developed for analysing noisy time - series , analytical methods for locally studying the underlying stochastic processes near the deterministic critical points and limit cycles , for a fixed reaction network , have also been developed  @xcite .",
    "statistical and analytical methods for studying cycles in stochastic reaction kinetics have been often focused on deterministically monostable systems which undergo a local bifurcation near a critical point , known as the supercritical hopf bifurcation .",
    "we suspect this is partially due to the simplicity of the bifurcation , and partially due to the fact that it is difficult to find two - species reaction systems , which are more amenable to mathematical analysis , undergoing more complicated bifurcations and displaying bistability involving stable limit cycles .",
    "nevertheless , more complicated bifurcations and structures in the phase space of the kinetic odes arising in biology can be found ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , and it is , thus , of importance to test the available methods on simpler test models that display some of the complexities found in the applications .    in this paper , we construct two reaction systems that are two - dimensional ( i.e. they only include two chemical species ) and induce cubic kinetic equations , first of which undergoes a global bifurcation known as a convex supercritical homoclinic bifurcation , and which displays bistability involving a critical point and a limit cycle ( which we call mixed bistability ) .",
    "the second system undergoes a local bifurcation known as a multiple limit cycle bifurcation , and displays bistability involving two limit cycles ( which we call bicyclicity ) . aside from finding an application as test models for statistical inference and analysis in biology , to our knowledge ,",
