    "in a universe described by a @xmath4+cold dark matter cosmology ( @xmath4cdm , @xcite ) , the predicted number of dark matter subhalos far exceeds the observed number of dwarf galaxies orbiting milky way - like galaxies . in the time since",
    "this discrepancy was dubbed ` the missing satellites problem ' @xcite , more than a dozen previously unseen ultra - faint ( l @xmath5 50,000 l@xmath1 ) local group dwarfs have been discovered , primarily in sdss ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and pandas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it is not yet clear whether the observed number , spatial distribution , and masses of these discoveries are consistent with cdm - based expectations @xcite .",
    "a common approach to cosmological interpretation of the mw s dwarf population is to predict the number ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and spatial distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) expected in surveys , such as the dark energy survey ( des , @xcite ) and the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst , @xcite ) .",
    "such predictions are typically either i ) based on an n - body simulation+semi - analytic galaxy formation model @xcite , or ii ) a completeness correction of the known number of mw dwarfs , using a physically motivated spatial distribution @xcite .",
    "all past predictions for ultra - faint dwarf galaxies in des and lsst have been subject to one or more limitations : i ) the use of only one average model or a single simulation to predict the spatial distribution of ultra - faint dwarfs , ii ) the use of isolated ( rather than paired mw / m31 ) galaxy simulations , iii ) the inclusion of  hyperfaint \" ( l @xmath5 10@xmath6 l@xmath1 ) dwarfs such as segue 1 in the same predictions as more luminous dwarfs , or iv ) the application of rigid magnitude limits for des and lsst .    in this paper , we take steps to overcome these limitations using the exploring the local volume in simulations ( elvis , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suite of n - body simulations , plus physically motivated toy models for populating subhalos with galaxies .",
    "we predict a spatial distribution of mw dwarf galaxies and correct the mw dwarf galaxy count for completeness . in section  [ sims ]",
    "we summarize our toy models . in section  [ sec : spatial ] we discuss the predicted spatial distributions of dwarfs , and in section  [ sec : results ] we present our predicted numbers .",
    "we summarize our expectations for des and lsst in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "owing to observational bias , the underlying spatial distribution of the mw s dwarf galaxy population is unknown . to statistically correct the observed number of mw dwarfs , we use spatial distributions of dark matter subhalos in the elvis simulations .",
    "elvis includes a dozen dark matter - only , cosmological zoom - in simulations of mw and andromeda pairs ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we consider the galaxy in each simulated pair with the lower virial mass to be the mw analog .",
    "the particle mass in the high - resolution regions of the fiducial simulations is @xmath7 .",
    "the simulation suite includes isolated simulations of each of the mw and andromeda analogs at the same resolution , with three simulated at a higher mass resolution of @xmath8 .",
    "the fiducial subhalo catalogs are complete to @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    to generate statistical descriptions for the spatial distribution of mw dwarfs , we implement three physically motivated toy models for which subhalos of the elvis mw analogs host dwarf galaxies - most massive in the past , earliest forming , and earliest infall .",
    "the first two models have been implemented in a number of past studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for all models we exclude any subhalos with @xmath11 , as their deeper potential wells are likely to host the more luminous `` classical '' dwarfs :    @xmath12 * massive in the past * ( @xmath13 ) : subhalos with deeper potential wells are more likely to retain and cool the gas fuel necessary for star formation .",
    "@xmath14 is the historical peak of a subhalo s circular velocity curve and provides a measure of potential well depth .",
    "we tested threshold values for @xmath14 of 12 @xmath15 and higher , and found an average of @xmath16 subhalos per mw - massed primary for @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath13 .",
    "although the typical number of subhalos in the higher threshold model is a better match to the predicted number of ultra - faint dwarfs , the spatial distribution of the higher threshold model is similar .",
    "we therefore implement the @xmath19 12 km s@xmath20 cut to improve statistics .",
    "@xmath12 * formed before reionization * ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) : another hypothesis is that the ultra - faint dwarf galaxies are  fossils \" that produced the bulk of their stars prior to reionization @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by photometric and spectroscopic studies of ultra - faint dwarfs , which show that these galaxies formed their stars within @xmath23 gyr of each other at early times @xcite .",
    "we follow the @xcite definition of reionization fossils as galaxies residing in halos with @xmath24 , and which had a resolved progenitor in the elvis paired simulations at @xmath25 .",
    "these thresholds result in @xmath26 subhalos per mw analog .",
    "@xmath12 * earliest infall * ( @xmath27 , i.e. @xmath28 gyr ago , and @xmath29 ) : an alternative model to explain the truncated star formation histories of ultra - faint dwarfs is that early infall into the mw s halo resulted in massive gas stripping ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "many of the mw s ultra - faint dwarfs show spatial or kinematic hints of tidal disturbance @xcite , which might be expected among dwarfs that have been orbiting within the mw s potential for the longest time , and with ( on average ) relatively smaller orbital pericenters . because subhalos typically reach @xmath14 just before infall onto a larger halo @xcite",
    ", we adopt the redshift of peak circular velocity as our estimate of the infall time .",
    "to avoid overestimating the poisson contribution to our uncertainties , for this model we exclude the four elvis pairs with resulting subhalo counts less than the number of @xmath0l@xmath1 dwarfs expected from an area - only correction ( @xmath30 ; zeus & hera , sonny & cher , hall & oates , thelma & louise ) .",
    "this model yields @xmath31 subhalos per mw analog .",
    "figure [ radial_profiles ] compares the cumulative radial profile of each toy model applied to : the 12 mw analogs from the paired fiducial simulations , the corresponding 12 isolated fiducial simulations , the 3 high - res isolated simulations , and the 3 corresponding fiducial isolated simulations .",
    "these comparisons demonstrate that the radial distributions of subhalos in the paired and isolated simulations are indistinguishable , and the high - res and fiducial - res simulations are statistically the same when comparing the same three simulated halos .",
    "the range of radial profiles from the 12 paired mw analogs are also shown , with the earliest infall model showing a large halo - to - halo variation .",
    "we will further discuss these radial distributions in  [ sec : spatial ] .",
    "a mild caveat for the elvis - based radial distributions is that baryonic physics can decrease the survivability of subhalos with small orbital pericenters .",
    "for example , tidal shocking of satellites by the mw s disk can accelerate mass loss @xcite .",
    "supernova feedback may yield cored density profiles in the most luminous dwarf satellites , making them more vulnerable to destruction @xcite .",
    "the former issue is more relevant to the ultra - faint dwarfs than the latter @xcite .",
    "however , both effects should drive the true surviving subhalo population to be less concentrated than the elvis toy models .",
    "thus our predictions may be lower limits to the expected satellites counts in future surveys .",
    "a complete census of dwarfs out to the mw s virial radius should provide the statistics needed to use the observed radial distribution of dwarfs to discriminate between some toy models for how dwarfs populate subhalos ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "figure  [ radial_profiles ] shows that the earliest infall subhalos are significantly more centrally concentrated than the most massive and earliest forming subhalos , which have very similar spatial distributions to that of all subhalos resolved in elvis .",
    "figure [ radial_profiles2 ] compares the radial distributions of each toy model to einasto , isothermal , and nfw radial profiles .",
    "all three toy models have profiles between einasto and nfw , with the early infall model best described by an nfw profile and the most massive and earliest forming models best described by an isothermal .",
    "while the mean differences in these toy model radial distributions cause the mean differences in the number of dwarfs we predict for each model , the halo - to - halo differences within each toy model ( figure [ radial_profiles ] ) contribute to the statistical uncertainty in each of our model predictions ( see  [ sec : results ] ) .    the lack of mw dwarf discoveries since the sdss data release 6 ( dr6 , 9100 deg@xmath32 , 12 dwarfs ) , has recently re - invigorated the discussion of the population s azimuthal anisotropy . inspired by this observational result , we explored @xmath4cdm expectations by generating 100 mock survey pointings for each of five survey areas ( @xmath33 ) in both the paired elvis mw analogs and a set of azimuthally uniform subhalo distributions (  poisson \" expectations ) .",
    "the survey - to - survey variation in subhalo counts ( for the median of all simulations ) is marginally consistent with poisson expectations on survey scales larger than @xmath34 10,000 deg@xmath32 . on smaller survey scales , however , poisson fluctuations are a lower - limit to the expected survey - to - survey variations .",
    "most elvis simulations ( @xmath34 9 of the 12 ) show survey - to - survey variations of up to twice those of poisson expectations , although usually only @xmath3425 - 50% more variation , underscoring the importance of accounting for azimuthal variations when making predictions ( see  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "we note that the lack of dwarfs in sdss dr8 is actually consistent with poisson expectations when only considering the 2900 deg@xmath32 of new imaging area at @xmath35 deg .",
    "there is a significant observational bias against finding dwarfs within 25 degrees of the mw s disk @xcite .    to look specifically for evidence of a systematic alignment of subhalos along the mw - m31 axis , we generated smoothed spatial maps of the resolved subhalo distributions ( stacked , medians , and individual ) , rotated to place the simulated m31 analog at the same galactic coordinates as m31 . although the stacked map showed a suggestive trend , we did not find a statistically significant global trend in the alignment of the subhalo distribution relative to m31 . examining",
    "the individual maps showed that only three paired simulations displayed an overdensity of subhalos in the direction of the m31 analog ( burr & hamilton , scylla & charybdis , and kek & kauket ) .",
    "we make our predictions using a method similar to @xcite .",
    "our approach has two steps : i ) completeness correcting the observed mw dwarfs to the total number of expected within 300 kpc within a randomly placed mock - sdss footprint , then ii ) scaling that result to a randomly placed mock des ( 5000 deg@xmath32 ) or lsst ( 20,000 deg@xmath32 ) survey with some magnitude limit . for each toy model and each fiducial survey magnitude limit",
    ", we simulate 100 mock - sdss + random survey pointings in each mw analog in the 12 paired elvis simulations .",
    "we adopt the 12,000 deg@xmath32 above @xmath36 25 deg for the sdss survey area because it is the portion of the sdss dr8 footprint with uniform detection limits @xcite and it includes all 14 dwarfs discovered in sdss .",
    "our correction only includes these 14 dwarfs , because we assume that dwarfs similar to those previously known would have already been detected at @xmath36 25 deg @xcite .",
    "this includes 10 l @xmath0 l@xmath1 dwarfs ( hercules , botes i , leo iv and v , pisces ii , canes venatici i and ii , uma i and ii , coma berenices ) and four  hyperfaint \" l @xmath2 l@xmath1 dwarfs ( botes ii , willman 1 , and segue 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the boundary at l @xmath37 l@xmath1 loosely corresponds to those objects that can only be discovered by main sequence turnoff stars and fainter ( too few red giant branch stars ) .    for each dwarf ,",
    "the corrected number within the sdss footprint is 1/(fraction of toy model subhalos within the maximum detection distance ) .",
    "we calculate each dwarf s maximum detection distance , @xmath38 , using the @xmath39 sdss detection efficiency function given by @xcite .",
    "this fraction is normalized to unity for @xmath38=300 kpc .",
    "only cvn i has @xmath40 kpc , resulting in no completeness correction .",
    "the values of @xmath38 for cvn ii , psc ii , and leo v are smaller than their observed distances , so we adopt @xmath41 as their @xmath38 s and perform an additional efficiency correction based on an estimated integrated detection efficiency within @xmath41 from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath42 = 1.0 , 0.5 , and 0.85 respectively ) .",
    "objects like the other 11 sdss dwarfs were detected with 100% efficiency with the @xcite algorithm , unlike the @xcite algorithm  the primary source of the difference between our and the @xcite results .    to scale the corrected numbers within the sdss footprint to the expected numbers in each mock des or lsst survey",
    ", we account for both survey area and point - source detection limit . rather than scaling directly by relative survey area , we scale by the ratio of the number of subhalos within @xmath43 of a mock survey area to the number within @xmath43 of a mock sdss .",
    "this captures the azimuthal anisotropy in the elvis simulations , allowing us to directly incorporate the effect into our uncertainties .",
    "we naively assume that completeness distances scale like the flux depth of each survey ( @xmath44 = @xmath45 @xmath46 10@xmath47 ) , given @xmath48 mag . in light of the challenges separating resolved stars from unresolved galaxies at faint apparent magnitudes , we consider @xmath49 for both des and lsst .",
    "we apply a slightly different method to the hyperfaint dwarfs , because the numbers of subhalos within their @xmath38 ( @xmath50 ) are too small to provide robust mock survey results . in some toy models ,",
    "several mw analogs have no subhalos within the @xmath51 of seg 1 ( @xmath52 kpc ) .",
    "we therefore used azimuthally - averaged radial distributions to predict an average number for each simulation and used the mock survey approach to estimate the 10/90 percent confidence intervals .",
    "we ignored any random mock survey pointing without a segue 1-like subhalo .",
    "the resulting predictions do not properly capture halo - to - halo and spatial anisotropy uncertainties , but they provide reasonable limits on the uncertainty in the predicted numbers .",
    "the top and bottom panels of figure  [ survey_summary ] show the predicted numbers of l @xmath0 l@xmath1 and l @xmath2 l@xmath1 dwarfs as a function of @xmath53-magnitude depth .",
    "we adopted the median and 10/90 percent confidence intervals from the 1200 mock surveys as our estimated number and uncertainty .",
    "the uncertainty on each number reflects both halo - to - halo and survey - to - survey ( radial and azimuthal ) variations .",
    "using our approach of correcting the known population of sdss dwarfs , we find that the use of paired versus isolated simulations does not yield systematically different predictions for the mw s dwarf population .",
    "although there is statistically significant super - poisson azimuthal anisotropy in the toy model subhalo distributions , this anisotropy appears neither extreme nor systematically aligned with m31 .",
    "we predict vastly different numbers of regular ( l @xmath0 l@xmath1 ) versus hyperfaint ( l @xmath2 l@xmath1 ) dwarfs ( see tables  [ tab : table1 ] and  [ tab : table2 ] ) . spanning all toy models , at 90% confidence , and assuming @xmath3= 25.8 mag : 3  13 regular vs. 999 hyperfaints",
    "should be discovered in des and 18  53 regular vs. 53307 hyperfaints should be discovered in lsst . over the entire sky and within 300 kpc ,",
    "we predict @xmath54 regular and @xmath55 hyperfaint dwarfs with 90% confidence ( see table  [ tab : table2 ] ) . owing to the severely limited numbers of subhalos within @xmath51 for the hyperfaint dwarfs , those predicted numbers are less robust and",
    "should be interpreted lightly in future observational studies .",
    "we emphasize that these numbers assume no future bias against discovering dwarfs at low galactic latitude .",
    "any interpretation of future observational studies must also cautiously account for this bias .",
    "the predicted number of l @xmath0 l@xmath1 dwarfs is strikingly lower than previous predictions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) due to our use of updated detection limits , the decreased rate of sdss dwarfs discovered per sky area , our toy models , and a 300 kpc distance limit .",
    "the lower limit on the predicted number of l @xmath0 l@xmath1 is similar to a simple area correction , because a mock - sdss can include an overdensity of subhalos and because the radial distribution of the early infall model of some mw analogs is very centrally concentrated .",
    "the discovery of only a few dwarfs in des imaging ( for a shallow survey limit of @xmath56 ) could be consistent with our lower limits .",
    "the predicted total numbers of dwarfs are not significantly different between the most massive in the past or the pre - reionization models , but the earliest infall model systematically predicts lower total numbers of dwarfs by a factor of @xmath342 .",
    "the discoveries of small numbers of dwarfs in future surveys would provide support for an early infall , or other centrally concentrated , model .",
    "however , such hypotheses may be more sensitively tested by the observed radial distribution of dwarfs ( e.g. section  [ sec : spatial ] , figure  [ radial_profiles ] ) .",
    "table  [ tab : table1 ] summarizes our des and lsst predictions for two effective survey depths , @xmath57 = 23.8 and 25.8 mag . both of these are shallower than the expected surveys 5@xmath58 point source detection limits",
    "the shallower limit is a pessimistic estimate of the effective survey depth possible for studies of low - surface brightness objects if color - based methods to separate stars from unresolved galaxies are not successful , while the deeper limit may be achievable with color - based , probabilistic star - galaxy separation @xcite .    within their footprints , and at high galactic latitudes , des and lsst",
    "should easily recover the full population of mw dwarfs similar to those known with l @xmath0 l@xmath1 .",
    "for lsst , @xmath59 corresponds to the expected single - visit imaging depth ( @xmath60 mag brighter than the @xmath61 point - source detection threshold ) and will be sufficient to discover l @xmath0 l@xmath1 dwarfs .",
    "increased imaging depths will primarily yield the detection of increasing numbers of hyperfaint dwarfs .",
