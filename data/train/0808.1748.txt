    "the collective behavior of spins in highly correlated quantum magnets typically establish order globally , over a large portion of the system by breaking a symmetry of the system .",

    "detailed understanding of this phenomenon requires quantitative analysis of the competing roles of superexchange , phonon , crystal field and jahn - teller effects .",
    "however , the orbital - only degrees of freedom in these systems have been shown to be approximately described by a quantum compass model with anisotropic pseudo - spin interaction terms given by superexchange contributions and an effective magnetic field determined by the crystal field splitting @xcite .",
