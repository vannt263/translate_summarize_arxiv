    "the @xmath30 lower limit on distance indicates an absolute magnitude of @xmath31 mag , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "these are consistent with the @xcite models for a 0.16  wd with a thick hydrogen envelope .",
    "however , these models predict a surface temperature of 9600 k and @xmath34 , an order of magnitude lower in surface gravity than the best - fit model shown in figure [ fig : spec ] .",
    "clearly , there is no single model that matches all of the properties of the primary star in lp 400 - 22 .",
    "a 0.19 @xmath5 wd model can match the the best - fit temperature and surface gravity measurements , but it underpredicts the absolute magnitude , radius , and distance .",
    "such a discrepancy between the model and parallax distance measurement for an average mass ( 0.6 ) da wd could indicate the existence of spectroscopically invisible helium .",
    "increased pressure broadening of hydrogen lines due to the presence of helium can imitate a higher surface gravity .",
    "gd 362 is perhaps the best example of such a system , where the initial model atmosphere analysis showed that the optical spectrum can be explained by a massive ( 1.2 ) da wd @xcite .",
    "however , follow - up high resolution observations @xcite and a parallax measurement @xcite showed that gd 362 indeed has a helium dominated atmosphere and that it is not a massive wd .",
    "since he becomes transparent below about 11,000 k , it is possible to hide significant amounts of he in the atmosphere of lp 400 - 22 . to investigate this possibility and to check whether a mixed h / he atmosphere solution would give results consistent with the parallax measurement , we computed model atmospheres with he / h ratios ranging from 0 to 100 .",
    "figure [ fig : linecomp ] shows the balmer line profiles of lp 400 - 22 compared to mixed atmosphere models with @xmath35 k , @xmath36 ( see the above discussion ) , and he / h = 0 , 1 , 10 , and 20 .",
    "none of these models provide a reasonable fit to the observed spectrum of lp 400 - 22 .",
    "this is because the addition of helium to a @xmath37 atmosphere does not have the same effect as that of a @xmath38 or 9 atmosphere .",
    "in addition , the spectral energy distribution analysis of @xcite using ultraviolet and optical photometry is in excellent agreement with the balmer line analysis using pure h models .",
    "hence , a temperature as low as 9600 k can be ruled out from both spectroscopy and photometry .",
    "figure [ fig : pressure ] shows the temperature , pressure , and balmer line profiles of mixed h / he atmosphere models with he / h = 20 and @xmath39 and 9 .",
    "the pressure for the @xmath37 model is two orders of magnitude smaller than it is for the @xmath40 model .",
    "the results are similar for models with different he / h ratios , e.g. he / h = 50 , 100 .",
    "hence , the effect of helium on the atmospheric structure and the balmer line profiles is negligible for low surface gravity models appropriate for elm wds , including lp 400 - 22 .",
    "figures [ fig : linecomp ] and [ fig : pressure ] demonstrate that the addition of he in our spectral models for lp 400 - 22 does not resolve the discrepancy between the observed properties and the evolutionary models .",
    "an alternative explanation for the discrepancy in the spectroscopic distance estimate is an unresolved da + dc wd system , where the dc wd companion is bright enough to contribute to the spectral continuum but not to the balmer line profiles .",
    "we tested this scenario by fitting the observed spectrum as a composite da + dc system .",
    "we fixed the @xmath11 of the dc component to @xmath41 or 7.7 ( 0.4 or 0.5 @xmath5 ) and allowed the other three parameters , temperature and surface gravity of the da component and the temperature of the dc component , to vary .",
    "our fitting algorithm achieves a good fit to the observed spectrum only if the dc component is cool enough ( @xmath42 k ) that it essentially does not contribute any light to the system .",
    "we do not find any plausible solutions involving a composite da + dc spectrum .",
    "@xcite and @xcite predict that @xmath43 wds suffer from diffusion - induced hydrogen shell flashes that lead to thin hydrogen envelopes .",
    "the surface gravity and temperature measurements for lp 400 - 22 place it right in the transition region between the objects with and without hydrogen shell flashes ( see fig .",
    "@xcite argue that the lower mass limit for shell flashes is 0.17 @xmath5 . below this mass limit , wds have a thick hydrogen surface layer that provides energy through stable hydrogen burning .",
    "this extra energy source slows down the evolution of the lowest mass wds , keeping them luminous for longer than expected .",
    "based on the @xcite models , the temperature and surface gravity measurements for lp 400 - 22 imply a @xmath44 wd with a thin h envelope of @xmath45 . on the other hand , its luminosity and colors do not match any of the @xcite cooling tracks ; lp 400 - 22 may be a pre - wd .",
    "the mass estimate for lp 400 - 22 ranges from 0.16 @xmath5 to 0.19 @xmath5 .",
    "the observed parallax implies that lp 400 - 22 is significantly more luminous than initially predicted from the models .",
    "however , given the uncertainties in models and specifically the transition from hydrogen shell flashes to stably burning envelopes for @xmath46  wds , it is perhaps not surprising to find discrepancies between the model expectations and the observed properties . regardless of these issues ,",
    "the observed surface gravity of the primary star in lp 400 - 22 shows that it is clearly a wd , and its brightness suggests that it is likely to have a thick envelope with stable hydrogen burning .",
    "we note that the elm wd in the eclipsing double wd binary nltt 11748 @xcite looks like a cooler version of the primary star in lp 400 - 22 .",
    "nltt 11748 has essentially the same surface gravity as lp 400 - 22 , but the primary wd has @xmath47 k. nltt 11748 was also observed as part of the usno parallax program , and the distance measurement agrees with model expectations for that star ( h. c. harris 2013 , private communication ) .",
    "hence , the difference between the nltt 11748 and lp 400 - 22 elm wds may be a slight difference in mass and a significant difference in the thickness of the surface hydrogen layer .",
    "the lack of a signature of a millisecond pulsar companion in the radio and x - ray observations demonstrate that lp 400 - 22 is a double wd binary system containing an elm wd and an invisible higher mass ( @xmath48 ) wd companion at an inclination larger than 33@xmath49 .",

    "for the three trajectories shown in figure [ fig : allorbits ] , the closest pericenter passage occurs 2 - 9 myr ago at distances of 0.9 - 3.9 kpc .",
    "hence , a galactic center origin is effectively ruled out for lp 400 - 22 .",
    "the main problem is that the @xmath52 component of the velocity , @xmath53 ( @xmath54 )  for the @xmath30 ( @xmath55 ) lower limit on distance , is too large for a trajectory originating in the galactic center .",
    "we note that the use of a different galactic potential , i.e. that of @xcite , does not change any of our conclusions .",
    "lp 400 - 22 is an unbound runaway binary wd system .",
    "there are other binary runaway systems known ; roughly 5% to 26% of runaway o - type stars are binary systems @xcite . however , lp 400 - 22 is unique , since it is the only runaway binary wd system currently known and it has an extremely large space velocity compared to typical runaway stars .",
    "unlike the neutron star companions to ob stars , a neutron star companion to lp 400 - 22 should be detected as a recycled millisecond pulsar through radial velocity , radio , and x - ray observations .",
    "our observations indicate that lp 400 - 22 binary has a circular orbit with no evidence of a neutron star companion .",

    "the observed space velocity of lp 400 - 22 and the non - detection of a neutron star companion indicate that the supernova ejection mechanism can not explain the origin of the lp 400 - 22 binary .",
    "hypervelocity binary systems may form due to the tidal disruption of a hierarchical triple star by the central black hole or the interaction of a binary star with a binary black hole at the galactic center .",
