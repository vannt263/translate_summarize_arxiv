    "beginning in the 1970 s significant advances in the understanding of nuclear multifragmentation were made possible with the advent of high statistics inclusive experiments .",
    "typically , only one intermediate mass fragment ( @xmath0 ) was detected per event .  from these inclusive studies",
    "came the first evidence that intermediate mass fragments ( imfs ) were associated with a simultaneous multi - body breakup of a system which had undergone expansion .",
    "a study of the fragment mass yield distribution obtained in an inclusive gas jet experiment conducted at fermilab contained the first indication that nuclear multifragmentation might be related to critical phenomena normally observed in macroscopic systems @xcite .",
    "the purdue group was the first to make the suggestion that the observed power law in the fragment yield distribution might result from a system whose excitation energy was comparable to its total binding energy @xcite .",
    "the exponent of the power law was @xmath1 , within the range expected for a system near its critical point .",
    "the presence of the power law and the value of the exponent , coupled with the strong similarity of the nuclear and van der waals potentials , led the purdue group to suggest that multifragmentation of nuclei might be analogous to a fluid undergoing a continuous phase transition from a liquid to a gas .",
    "furthermore , the fisher droplet model ( fmd ) @xcite-@xcite , used to describe condensation in a fluid system near its critical point , after modification for nuclear physics effects , was capable of describing the isotopic yields of 50 fragments with one set of parameters @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the system was determined to be about 5 mev @xcite , a reasonable value considering that the average binding energy per nucleon in a nucleus is approximately 8 mev .   the success of this approach reinforced the notion that multifragmentation was both a thermal process and that it was related to critical phenomena .    with the advent of exclusive experiments capable of detecting all of the charged reaction products , the possibility of studying multifragmentation on an event - by - event basis became a reality .",
    "high statistics exclusive experiments in which the fragmenting system is characterized according to its nucleon number and excitation energy permit both the correlation of dynamical and statistical information and the study of fluctuations in experimental observables .",
    "fluctuations are central to all critical phenomena , and indeed , such fluctuations are apparent in exclusive multifragmentation data .  in this paper , the focus will be on the statistical signals of multifragmentation data observed in the eos experiment @xcite-@xcite .",
    "comparisons will be made with two other systems , one of which exhibits critical behavior and one of which does not .",
    "much of the pioneering work in understanding the statistical aspects of multifragmentation has been performed by campi @xcite-@xcite and mekjian @xcite-@xcite .",
    "both efforts have compared multifragmentation data to model systems in order to gain some insight into the nuclear breakup process .  in this paper , many of the ideas suggested by these authors are followed and applied to both the eos data and the model systems in order to demonstrate which of the many suggested signals are useful for the identification of critical behavior .",
    "a major goal of this paper is to present a comprehensive review of several methods proposed for detecting signals of critical phenomena in multifragmentation .",
    "it is tempting to compare the experimental data to dynamical models that attempt to describe nuclear multifragmentation .",
    "however , the task of modeling multifragmentation from the initial collision phase of the reaction to freeze - out has proven to be a daunting task .",
    "models that adequately describe the initial stage of the reaction @xcite-@xcite do not satisfactorily describe the fragment formation stage , in either statistical or dynamical aspects .   likewise , the most successful models in describing the statistical properties of nuclear multifragmentation @xcite-@xcite , assume thermodynamic equilibrium , yet fail to adequately match the dynamical features of the data .",
    "molecular dynamical approaches , which have enjoyed considerable success in describing critical behavior in classical systems @xcite-@xcite , have not been conclusive in describing nuclear multifragmentation and at times have yielded contradictory results @xcite , @xcite .",
    "later studies suggested flaws in the application of molecular dynamical models to nuclear multifragmentation , therefore calling into question the conclusions drawn from the earlier studies @xcite .",
    "the most striking of the early theoretical efforts came from campi s analysis of a few hundred completely reconstructed emulsion multifragmentation events @xcite and the comparison of these data to clusters generated from a percolation calculation @xcite , @xcite .  in this series of papers it was shown that the fragment distributions from multifragmentation bore a striking similarity to the cluster distributions from percolation lattices .",
    "this analysis provided strong evidence that multifragmentation was a statistical process which appeared to be related to critical phenomena .  in this analysis",
    "another estimate of the exponent @xmath2 was made which agreed with the first measurements from the purdue group and several later analyses of various fragment distributions .    in the early 1990",
    "s the aladin group from gsi performed several multifragmentation experiments @xcite-@xcite",
    ".  of particular importance was the `` rise and fall '' of multifragmentation .  in one analysis the aladin group plotted the `` rise and fall '' curve of the production of imfs versus",
    "an observable related to the excitation energy of the reaction for several multifragmenting systems .  with the appropriate scaling",
    "the data collapsed to a single curve suggesting that the multifragmenting systems retained no memory of the reaction entrance channel .",
    "this is expected for an equilibrated system .",
    "the results of some statistical analyses of multifragmentation data could be interpreted to suggest that multifragmentation is a sequential decay @xcite in contrast to the phase transition picture .",
    "the same sort of statistical analysis has also been applied to explicitly simultaneous models @xcite and produced results that were similar to those of multifragmentation data .",
    "thus those signals could be interpreted as evidence for either sequential or simultaneous multifragmentation @xcite .",
    "this last effort puts into focus the main question in this work : what type of analysis of the statistical aspects of a cluster distribution can provide the most insight into the nature of the mechanism which created the clusters ?  specifically , can those systems which contain critical behavior be distinguished from those which do not ?  it will be argued that this question has two answers .",
    "analysis of the _ insensitive _ features of the cluster distribution can not make the above mentioned distinction @xcite .",
    "however , an analysis of the _ sensitive _ features of the cluster distribution will be shown to provide deeper insight into the cluster production mechanism .",
    "this type of analysis has been previously reported for clusters resulting from nuclear multifragmentation @xcite-@xcite .",
    "note that the more generic term _",
    "cluster _ will be used to refer to any composite of constituents , whether these be molecules of a fluid , nuclear fragments or percolation clusters .",
    "the method employed to address the above question is as follows .",
    "the same analysis is performed on the cluster distributions produced by three different systems .  in one case ,",
    "clusters are generated by randomly partitioning an integer .",
    "such one - dimensional partitioning does not posses critical behavior indicative of a continuous phase transition .  in the second case ,",
    "three - dimensional bond building percolation is used to produce clusters .",
    "percolation is well - known mathematical construct that possesses a continuous phase transition , _ i.e. _ a critical point .",
    "finally , the cluster distributions resulting from the multifragmentation of gold nuclei are analyzed .",
    "although it is not known , a priori , whether the nuclear multifragmentation bears any relation to critical phenomena , it will be seen that the analysis presented in this work yields suggestive results .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .  in section ii a description of each system is presented .  in section iii the fisher droplet model is reviewed .  in section iv - a the insensitive signatures of the cluster distributions for all systems are examined .  in section iv - b",
    "the sensitive signatures are examined .",
    "sections v and vi present possible corrections to the analysis of the multifragmentation data .",
    "finally , section vii discusses the conclusions reached upon the completion of the analyses in sections iv and v. throughout this paper the term _ continuous phase transition _ will be used instead of _ second order phase transition _ , the latter from the outdated ehrenfest theory of phase transitions @xcite .",
    "approximately 40,000 fully reconstructed events ( @xmath4 ) were collected with the eos experimental apparatus discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .  in the collision of the projectile gold nucleus ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) and the target carbon nucleus ,",
    "so - called prompt nucleons are knocked out of the gold nucleus by quasi - elastic and inelastic collisions between projectile and target nucleons @xcite .",
    "immdeiately following the collision , he gold projectile remnant is in an excited state with fewer than 197 nucleons .",
    "the excited remnant cools and expands , evolving to the neighborhood of the critical point in the temperature - density plane @xcite , where clusters condense from a high temperature low density vapor of nucleons .",
    "the charge and mass of the projectile remnant , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , were determined for each event by subtracting the charge and mass of the prompt particles from the charge and mass of the gold nucleus @xcite .",
    "prompt particles have @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 and are removed from the cluster distributions analyzed in this work .",
    "only clusters created from the excited gold projectile are considered in the ensuing analysis .  for events with",
    "the lowest charged particle multiplicities , @xmath12 , the remnant had @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 mev@xmath16nucleon , while for events with the highest multiplicities the remnant had @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 mev@xmath16nucleon @xcite .",
    "clusters of a given charge , @xmath20 , were counted on an event by event basis to determine the cluster charge distribution , @xmath21 .  in this analysis , although the mass number of the clusters is of interest , a cluster s charge will be used as an index .",
    "mass numbers for clusters of charge one and two were measured in the eos time projection chamber .  clusters with @xmath22 were assigned a mass number , @xmath23 , by multiplying the cluster charge by the mass to charge ratio of the excited gold projectile remnant ; for low @xmath12 events @xmath24 and for high @xmath12 events @xmath25 .",
    "this procedure provided an estimate of a cluster s mass number prior to any secondary decay effects .",
    "it is assumed that on average @xmath26 .  finally , it is the normalized cluster distribution , @xmath27 , that is used in the analysis presented in this paper .",
    "bond building percolation calculations were performed on three dimensional simple cubic lattices of 216 sites .",
    "cluster distributions for @xmath28 lattice realizations were generated in the standard fashion by forming bonds between sites .",
    "bonds were either active ( on ) or inactive ( off ) according to the following algorithm .    the control parameter ( _ e.g. _ temperature in thermodynamic systems ) for percolation is the lattice probability , @xmath29 .",
    "a single value of @xmath29 was chosen for the entire lattice .",
    "all probabilities were between 0 and 1 .  next",
    ", a bond probability , @xmath30 , was randomly chosen from a uniform distribution on ( 0,1 ) for the @xmath31 bond .",
    "if @xmath30 was less than @xmath29 , then the @xmath31 bond was active and two sites were joined into a cluster .",
    "this process was performed for each bond in the lattice .    at low values of @xmath29",
    ", few bonds were formed resulting in a high multiplicity , @xmath12 , of small clusters , a distribution analogous to the gaseous phase of a fluid .  at high values of @xmath29 ,",
    "many bonds were formed resulting in a low multiplicity of mostly large clusters , analogous to the liquid phase of a fluid .  in an infinite lattice",
    "the phase transition occurs at a unique value of the lattice probability , @xmath32 , when the probability of forming a percolating cluster changes from zero to unity .    to examine the behavior of the average cluster distribution ,",
    "the number of clusters of size @xmath23 per lattice site was calculated by histogramming the @xmath28 lattice realizations into 100 bins from @xmath33 to @xmath10 .",
    "the use of @xmath12 as a control parameter and the ensuing effects on signatures of continuous phase transition were investigated by calculating the average number of clusters of size @xmath23 with the @xmath28 lattice realizations histogrammed in units of @xmath12 .",
    "random partitions were generated from 79 total system constituents , chosen to approximate the number of charges in the gold multifragmentation system .",
    "the algorithm is as follows .",
    "first a random choice of @xmath12 was made from a uniform distribution on ( 1,79 ) .",
    "next the maximum size of a cluster , @xmath34 , for an event with @xmath12 was determined ; this depended on the constraints of the system size , @xmath35 and the choice of @xmath12 .",
    "the size of the first cluster , @xmath36 , was then randomly chosen from a uniform distribution on @xmath37 .",
    "there were then @xmath38 clusters to be generated from @xmath39 constituents .",
    "the maximum size of a cluster for an @xmath38 event from a @xmath40 constituent system was determined : @xmath41 .",
    "the size of the second cluster , @xmath42 , was then randomly chosen form a uniform distribution on @xmath43 .",
    "this process was repeated until all constituents belonged to a cluster .",
    "@xmath28 partitions were generated in this manner .",
    "this particular weighting results in a power law cluster distribution @xcite .",
    "the focus of most studies of phase transitions is on standard thermodynamical variables such as a system s temperature , density , compressibility , etc .",
    "these quantities are difficult or impossible to measure directly in present nuclear multifragmentation experiments .",
    "thus a theory which addresses quantities accessible to mf experiments is needed .  to that end fisher s gas - to - liquid phase transition model , based on mayer s condensation theory ,",
    "is followed @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "fisher begins his model , called the fisher droplet model ( fdm ) hereafter , by writing the free energy for the formation of clusters of size @xmath23 as : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the boltzmann constant and the @xmath46-term is the bulk formation energy , or volume term and : @xmath47 ,       \\label{volume_term}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the chemical potential and @xmath49 is the chemical potential along the coexistence curve .",
    "the @xmath50-term is related to the surface free energy of cluster formation .",

    "all formulations of @xmath55 are such that @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) corresponds to the _ liquid _ ( _ gas _ ) region .",
    "this form of the surface free energy is applicable on only one side of the critical point , the single phase side .",
    "a more general form suggested by efforts from percolation theory @xcite-@xcite that can be applied on both sides of the critical point and leads to a power law which describes the behavior of the order parameter is : @xmath61 ,       \\label{surface_term_leath}\\ ] ] where the scaling variable , @xmath62 , is @xmath63 the physical interpretation of the parameters @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 is an open question .    finally @xmath67 is another critical exponent depending principally on the dimensionality of the system and has its origins in considerations of a three dimensional random walk of a surface closing in on itself .  for three dimensions @xmath68 @xcite .  in eq .",
    "( [ free_energy ] ) , @xmath69 is a normalization constant which will be shown to depend solely on the value of @xmath67 @xcite .    from the free energy of cluster formation the average cluster distribution normalized to the size of the system is : @xmath70 at the critical point , @xmath71 , both @xmath50 and @xmath46 are unity and the cluster distribution is given by a pure power law : @xmath72 if the first moment of the normalized cluster distribution is considered at the critical point then @xcite : @xmath73 when the sum runs over all clusters .  from eq .",
    "( [ normalization ] ) it is obvious that the value of the overall cluster distribution normalization constant , @xmath69 , is dependent on @xmath67 via a riemann @xmath74-function : @xmath75 the above is true only if the scaling assumptions in the fdm apply to all clusters .  for finite size systems even at the critical point",
    "this is only approximately true .",
    "however , it will be seen that eq .",
    "( [ zeta_function ] ) holds reasonably well at the critical point for systems with a continuous phase transition over some range in cluster size .    in the fdm",
    "it is assumed that all clusters of size @xmath23 can be treated as an ideal gas , so that the total pressure of the entire cluster distribution can be determined by summing all of the partial pressures : @xmath76 is is clear from eq .",
    "( [ pressure_a ] ) that the pressure of the system is related to the zeroth moment of the cluster distribution .",
    "the density is then : @xmath77 the density is given by the first moment of the cluster distribution .",
    "it is now a simple matter to derive the power law which describes the divergence of the isothermal compressibility , @xmath78 .  by definition :",
    "@xmath79 noting that @xmath80 , eq .",
    "( [ compressibility_a ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath81 which leads to : @xmath82 the sum in the second term illustrates the relation of the second moment of the cluster distribution , @xmath83 , to the isothermal compressibility .",
    "the sums in eq .",
    "( [ pressure_a ] ) , ( [ density ] ) and ( [ compressibility_c ] ) run over all clusters in the gas and exclude the bulk liquid drop .  in percolation and multifragmentation",
    "the largest cluster on the liquid side of the critical point will be considered as the liquid drop and will thus be excluded from the sum .  on the gas side of the critical point",

    "the scaling relation between the exponents @xmath88 , @xmath52 and @xmath67 is : @xmath89    the absolute normalization constants of the @xmath83 power law depend on the scaling function , @xmath90 , the exponent @xmath52 and the overall normalization of the cluster distribution , @xmath69 , which in turn depends on the exponent @xmath67 : @xmath91 the second moment is related to the isothermal compressibility by the temperature and density of the system .",
    "the derivation of the @xmath88-power law demonstrates one way to arrive at the scaling relations between the critical exponents .",
    "in addition it illustrates the existence of only two independent exponents and shows the relation of the moments of the cluster distribution to familiar thermodynamic quantities .",
    "fisher s framework here illustrated and tempered by percolation theory will be used in the analysis of the cluster distributions of the three systems discussed above .",
    "it will be seen that in the case of systems which exhibit a continuous phase transition , the framework of fisher is well followed , while for systems with no such phase transition , the framework fails , as it should .",
    "in this section the insensitive features of the cluster distribution for each system are examined .",
    "it will be demonstrated that on this level of analysis each system exhibits behaviors that are consistent with systems which undergo a continuous phase transition .",
    "the conclusion is inescapable that this sort of analysis can yield necessary , but not sufficient , signals and no further insight to the mechanism behind multifragmentation .",
    "a deeper analysis will be necessary to distinguish those systems which undergo such a phase transition from those which do not .",
    "one of the most striking characteristics of systems undergoing continuous phase transitions is the occurrence of fluctuations that exist on all length scales in a small range of the control parameter .  in fluid systems",
    "this was observed as critical opalescence , first noted by andrews in the latter half of the @xmath92 century @xcite .",
    "fluctuations in cluster size and the density of the system arise because of the disappearance of the latent heat at the critical point .",
    "this is illustrated in the fdm when the isothermal compressibility diverges at the critical point and small changes in pressure gives rise to great changes in the density .  in the fdm",
    "as the volume and surface contribution to the free energy of cluster formation vanishes the power law dominates and clusters of all length scales are observed @xcite .    in a cluster distribution",
    "the most readily observed fluctuations are those in the size of the largest cluster .  for each system",
    "the root mean square ( rms ) fluctuations in the size of the largest cluster normalized to the size of the system , @xmath93 , have been calculated as a function of the system s control parameter .",
    "this measure of the fluctuations in the cluster distribution was first studied by campi for gold multifragmentation and percolation @xcite .",
    "those results are replicated here for those two systems .",
    "figure 1a shows @xmath94 , as a function of @xmath29 for percolation .  as expected for a system known to exhibit a continuous phase transition , the rms fluctuations peak over a narrow range in the control parameter .",
    "the location of this peak provides a first estimate of the critical point ; @xmath95 .",
    "see table i.    [ h ]    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the scaling function for percolation ( @xmath29 and @xmath12 ) determined here is _ the _ scaling function for percolation in three dimensions , _",
    "i.e. _ it is universal for three dimensional percolation independent of size .",
    "the scaling functions for @xmath29 and @xmath12 determined above agree well with the scaled cluster distributions of different size lattices , see figure 23 , and can be used to predict the behavior of the second moment for any size lattice @xcite .  in the same spirit ,",
    "the scaling function determined here for gold multifragmentation is the scaling function for charged nuclear matter which describes the cluster distributions produced in the multifragmentation of any nucleus , not just the excited gold remnant discussed in this work .  with the knowledge of the form of the scaling function various other quantities",
    "can be determined as illustrated in section iii and shown below .",

    "the previous works the procedure for determining critical exponent values and the location of the critical point from the cluster distribution was based on a method of matching exponent values on both sides of the critical point @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the idea was to find the region on either side of the critical point where the power law behavior predicted by the scaling function holds .  as is seen in figure 24",
    "there is some intermediate @xmath55 region where the second moment data are described by a power law , a region where the @xmath98 behavior is dominated by the @xmath88-power law and all other effects are small in comparison .  in earlier percolation studies @xcite general guidelines based on the correlation length and size of the fluctuations",
    "were used to find the boundaries in @xmath55 of the regions to be fit .  in nuclear multifragmentation analyses",
    "@xcite it was impossible to use such guidelines .",
    "instead a method was developed that searched for regions best fit by power laws and determined the location of the critical point and exponent values simultaneously .",
    "the values of the critical exponents and the normalizations associated with power laws were obtained from the best fit power laws in those regions .  as with the previous analyses presented in this paper , this method of exponent matching does not select a particular value of a critical exponent or the critical point .",

    "a choice of the critical point , @xmath32 or @xmath105 was made .  from this choice plots such as those shown in figure 24",
    "were made .",

    "the effect of the coulomb energy may evidence itself in the degree of collapse of the data .",
    "the fact that , to a large extent , the data do collapse without any explicit adjustment to the theory ( _ i.e. _ formalation of the scaling variable , @xmath195 ) may then be an indication that the coulomb energy is not a major perturbation .",
    "hence , it is perhaps justifiable to adhere to the coulomb - free theory when scaling @xmath196 .",
    "the focus in the present paper has been on cluster distributions and the types of analyses which can shed light on their creation mechanism .",
    "in particular , attempts were made to identify procedures that can distinguish those distributions which are related to critical behavior from those which are not .  while this question is easily answered for systems containing large numbers of constituents , it is much more difficult to address the case of interest here , namely systems with at most only a few hundred particles .  in such systems ,",
    "finite size effects play a large role .",
    "therefore , two different computational models , bond building percolation and a random partitions , have been used .",
    "it is well known that in the macroscopic limit , the former system possesses a continuous phase transition characterized by a unique scaling function and set of critical exponents while the latter system does not .",
    "in addition , data arising from the multifragmentation of gold nuclei has been studied using the same procedures .  for this system , it is not known , a priori , whether a critical point is present .",
    "many cluster properties have been proposed as being suitable measures of critical behavior .  among these are the fluctuations in the size of largest fragment ( figure 1 ) , peaking in the quantity @xmath197 ( figure 3 ) , peaking behavior in @xmath98 ( figure 5 ) , campi plots ( figure 6 ) and simple power law behavior in the cluster mass distribution for a particular value of the appropriate control parameter .",
    "it was seen that none of these measures , taken alone or together , was sufficient to distinguish a system possessing critical behavior from one which does not .    the first procedure which produced different results for critical and noncritical systems was the single parameter power law fit to the cluster mass distribution ( figures 12 through 15 ) .",
    "for the percolation systems and for the multifragmentation data , it was shown that the one parameter power law fit describes the data well only over a very limited range of the control parameter .",
    "the value of the control parameter where the power law fit is best is very close to where the abovementioned peaks occur .",
    "however , for the random partitions , this was not the case .",
    "if a system possesses a critical point , it is also expected to possess a scaling function that describes its behavior away from the critical point .",
    "phase transition theory specifies how the argument of this function depends on cluster mass and distance from the critical point .",
    "if such a function exists , the theory permits the determination of the critical exponent @xmath52 .",
    "this determination was done for the percolation system yielding satisfactory agreement with its known value .",
    "the same procedure was applied to the random breakup model and to the multifragmentation data .",
    "it was clear from this analysis that percolation and multifragmentation were very similar in many features , while the random system was distinctly different .",
    "see figures 17 and 18 .",
    "again , if a system possesses a critical point , it is expected to possess a scaling function that describes its behavior away from the critical point .",
    "therefore , when the data is properly scaled , it should collapse onto a single curve .",
    "figure 19 shows the amount of data collapse for the systems discussed here .",
    "the quality of the data collapse ( figures 19 - 21 ) reinforces the notion that the random breakup system is different from the others .",
    "although the precise form of the scaling function is not dictated by phase transition theory , both the percolation system and multifragmentation data were satisfactorily described by a sum of two gaussians .",
    "the random breakup model was not .",
    "the issue of finite size scaling was discussed .  unlike the other systems examined here , which had a fixed number of constituents , the nuclear multifragmentation data originated from systems whose size varied monotonically with observed charged particle multiplicity .",
    "see figure 27a .",
    "phase transition theory makes a prediction , eq .",
    "( [ fss ] ) , as to how the value of the control parameter at the critical point changes as a function of system size .",
    "applying eq .",
    "( [ fss ] ) produced an improvement in the quality of the data collapse for the scaling function and yielded a better prediction for the behavior of @xmath98 .",
    "see figure 28 .",
    "critical exponent values have been determined in an unbiased manner for each system .  for both sets of analyses on the percolation clusters , the standard percolation exponents were recovered to within error bars .  for the random partitioning , exponents could be extracted , but none that fulfilled well known scaling laws .",
    "the exponent values determined from the gold multifragmentation cluster distributions fulfill the scaling laws , to within error bars , and fall near the three dimensional ising universality class .",

    "such effects become significant above @xmath198 mev / nucleon .",

    "the exponent @xmath52 is determined by the multiplicities at which individual light fragment yields attain their peak values .   as shown in figure 17d , the lightest fragments peak at large multiplicities , corresponding to excitation energies for which secondary decay are important in the smm .",
    "an smm calculation @xcite indicates that the value of @xmath52 from the smm s fragment distribution was increased by about @xmath199% due to this effect .  however , it is unclear from that calculation that the effects of secondary decay are as great in the experimental data as they are in the smm .",
    "the smm calculation over predicts the yield of light fragments which could indicate that the smm estimates of secondary decay are too severe .",
    "corrections to the model independent quantities determined in this paper based on the smm calculations are premature .",
    "see appendix c for discussions of another set of model based interpretations .",
    "although the multifragmentation data possess many of the gross and detailed characteristics that the percolation system does , it is not at all obvious why this should be the case .",
    "after all , real nuclei obey quantum mechanics , have varying binding energies per particle , and , most significantly , are charged .  on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that near a critical point the details of the interaction become unimportant and only the dimensionality of the system and the dimension of the order parameter are important .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the attractive nuclear force bears a similarity to a van der waals force .  however , the coulomb force is a long range force and imposes a natural limit to the size of stable nuclei .",
    "thus , it is not clear to what extent a finite charged system can exhibit critical behavior when the macroscopic system can not exist .",
    "the exact role of the coulomb force in physical systems undergoing a change of phase is currently of great interest @xcite , @xcite and is , at this point , an open question .",
    "the philosophy of this paper has been to make use of phase transition theory as it applies to uncharged systems .",
    "what results for the analysis of the gold multifragmentation data bears great similarity to the results of the same procedures applied to a system known to possess a critical point .",
    "it is tempting then to conclude that multifragmentation is related to critical behavior occurring in a finite nuclear system .",

    "increasing the upper limit of the summation in the @xmath74-function causes no significant changes in the analysis presented in this work .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite , gulminelli and chomaz ( gc ) report on calculations made using a lattice gas model .",
    "their results can be divided into two different categories : ( 1 ) an analysis of the thermodynamic quantities of the system ; ( 2 ) an analysis of the statistical properties of the droplet or cluster distribution .",
    "in their paper gc performed canonical calculations on a three dimensional lattice of @xmath206 sites ( @xmath207 or @xmath208 ) with periodic boundary conditions at a given temperature , @xmath163 , and density , @xmath209 .",
    "the density was varied by changing the number of particles in the system , @xmath159 , with @xmath210 .  for a choice of @xmath163 ,",
    "@xmath209 was varied and the system s chemical potential , @xmath48 , was determined .  at some values of @xmath163 the @xmath211",
    "vs. @xmath212 ( @xmath211 vs. @xmath159 ) isotherm exhibited a back bend .",
    "as @xmath163 increased the back bend disappeared .",
    "this was taken as evidence that a first order phase transition ( back bending @xmath211 vs. @xmath159 ) had culminated in a continuous phase transition ( flat @xmath211 vs. @xmath159 ) .",
    "the critical point , ( @xmath196 , @xmath213 ) , was thus defined .  via a maxwell construction",
    ", gc also determined the boundary of the coexistence zone .",
    "the theoretical ideas behind the procedure followed by gc are sound ( with the exception of the questionable definition of volume in a system with periodic boundary conditions ) , however the execution is flawed .",
    "the error in execution lies in the method by which @xmath209 was varied .",
    "gc varied @xmath209 by holding @xmath206 , the volume of the system , fixed and varying @xmath159 , the number of constituents or `` size '' of the system .",
    "therefore , at each value of @xmath209 gc have a system of different size .",
    "it is well known that the effective @xmath196 of a system varies with its system s size @xcite-@xcite .",
    "thus each time gc varied @xmath159 to vary @xmath209 they were dealing with a system with a different @xmath196 .  with this understanding",
    "it is clear that a plot of @xmath48 versus @xmath159 as shown by gc in their figure .",
    "1a , which serves as the basis for their determination of the critical point , is difficult to interpret .",
    "@xmath196 can not be deduced in the manner followed by gc .",
    "similarly , it is impossible to determine @xmath213 for a system of @xmath214 using information from a system of @xmath215 without accounting for the finite size scaling of the critical point .",
    "this makes the thermodynamically extracted values of the critical point suspect and calls into question the validity of the coexistence line shown by gc in the lower part of their figure 3 .    via an analysis of the droplet distributions gc",
    "determined the value of the critical exponent @xmath216 based on the peak in the production of different size droplets .",
    "the value of @xmath196 was determined coupling the @xmath217 results with a two parameter power law fit the droplet distribution at various temperatures , @xmath218 , at @xmath196 @xmath219 .",
    "the use of two parameter fits is generally an improper method to determine @xmath67 @xcite-@xcite .  in this analysis gc",
    "determine @xmath196 on a system - by - system basis , avoiding the error of grouping systems of different size together .",
    "gc also extracted the exponent @xmath52 and then used the above results to collapse the droplet data onto a single curve illustrating the scaling function that modifies the power law away from the critical point .",
    "while the data collapses onto a single curve , the value of the curve at @xmath196 is problematic .  from gc",
    "s work the value of the scaling function at @xmath196 is @xmath220 which contradicts the @xmath67 values extracted by gc according to the riemann @xmath74-function relation between @xmath67 and @xmath221 @xcite ; _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath222 gives @xmath223 , while gc s @xmath220 gives @xmath224 .",
    "finally gc combine the results of their analyses and assert that the krtesz line of @xmath67 power laws continues into the coexistence region of the lattice gas and that this behavior is observed due to the finite size of the system and is not observed in systems of much greater size",
    ".  however , due to the problems in gc s method of varying @xmath209 to find the coexistence curve , such a claim is premature .  instead",
    ", their estimates of @xmath196 from the droplet analysis , which are shown as a string of points in their figure 3 , may reflect the finite size scaling of the critical point and not the krtesz line extending into the coexistence zone .",
    "that each different size system appears to be at @xmath213 as well as @xmath196 , illustrated by the data collapse , may be explained by the relation @xmath225 .  for a 3d ising system @xmath226 .",
    "thus , systems of finite size near their critical density are nearly on the coexistence curve and show the sort of data collapse illustrated in gc s figure 2 @xcite .",
