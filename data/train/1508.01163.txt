    "molecular and turbulent motions are traditionally thought to exist at very different scales , separated by three or more orders of magnitude @xcite . as a result ,",
    "turbulence at the molecular scale has not been the focus of significant study @xcite , in large part due to the prohibitive molecular system sizes required .",
    "however , as will be shown in this work , through careful choice of viscosity and geometry a turbulent molecular simulation is possible with current computing resources .",
    "the traditional simulation tool for turbulent flow is continuum computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) @xcite .",
    "cfd models the flow of fluids away from hydrodynamic equilibrium , using the navier - stokes equation .",
    "the navier - stokes equation is based on newton s law , with additional assumptions , namely : a newtonian framework in an inertial reference frame , thermodynamic equilibrium ( or quasi - equilibrium ) , fluid isotropy , stress tensor symmetry and sometimes incompressibility @xcite . only with the advent of computers",
    "have general numerical solutions of the navier - stokes equations been possible . with these numerical solutions , complex and apparently random behavior",
    "is the norm , a phenomenon known in fluid mechanics as turbulence .",
    "turbulence is a feature of almost every case of engineering interest .",
    "greater understanding of this phenomenon would facilitate improvements in predictive capabilities and advances in engineering design .",
    "non - equilibrium molecular dynamics ( nemd ) @xcite is an alternative approach to fluid modeling which requires only newton s laws and a form of inter - molecular potential . as a more fundamental model , molecular dynamics ( md ) captures a much greater range of phenomena with no additional assumptions .",
    "examples include : arbitrarily strong shock waves @xcite , bubble nucleation , phases change and co - existence @xcite , moving three - phase contact lines @xcite exact energy conservation @xcite , visco - elasticity or memory effects @xcite and detailed solid - liquid interface @xcite .",
    "the price for this generality is in computational overhead , limiting accessible systems to the microscale . despite this",
    ", many complex fluid dynamical phenomena have been reproduced at the molecular scale , with excellent agreement to the continuum .",
    "these include poiseuille and couette flow @xcite , vortex shedding on a cylinder @xcite or plate @xcite , taylor - couette rolls @xcite , the rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite , two dimensional fluid mixing @xcite as well as turbulence like vortices due to shock waves @xcite .",
    "the fundamental nature of md means it is uniquely placed to provide insight into the mechanisms of turbulent transport .",
    "figure [ cascade_schematic ] shows a schematic of the spectral energy cascade , believed to be a central feature of turbulent flow @xcite .",
    "large scales eddying motions break down into smaller scales until at some minimum length scale the coherent motions dissipate to heat as a consequence of viscosity .",
    "energy is conserved in an md simulation and the viscous heating is simply the change of coherent velocity to non - coherent molecular fluctuations .",
    "molecular simulation requires no grid and the minimum flow scale is dictated by the underlying configuration of the molecules themselves . as a result , molecular modeling of turbulence",
    "has the potential to provide a complete picture of the energy cascade and link thermodynamic concepts such as pressure and temperature along with viscosity to hydrodynamic fluctuations .",
    "the range of application of various fluid modeling methodologies are included on figure [ cascade_schematic ] .",
    "reynolds averaged navier stokes ( rans ) is the most commonly used industrial solution to fluid problems and models only the largest scales .",
    "molecular simulation can be viewed as a refinement to direct numerical simulation ( dns ) , where sub - dissipative scales are modelled with no filtering of thermodynamic ` noise ' .",
    "this is analogous to large eddy simulation ( les ) which filters the smaller turbulent motions of a dns , replacing them with a closure model to approximate the details . from this viewpoint , viscosity and pressure in a continuum solution",
    "are simply a closure model to replace the filtered molecular detail .",
    "there is therefore a clear benefit of md to industrial fluid mechanics , especially in the rapidly developing field of nano and micro fluidics . as with dns simulation ,",
    "md can be used to refine and improve the underlying models which are essential to industrial cfd simulation .    in this work ,",
    "we aim to explore the minimum scale at which turbulence breaks down into viscous heat .",
    "we reduce the system size until it contains only the simplest turbulent flow  known as the minimal flow - unit in the literature @xcite .",
    "the smallest turbulent flow - unit is found in planar couette flow , where a viscous fluid is driven by two infinite plates sliding in opposite directions .",
    "this simulated case is an example of wall - bounded turbulent shear flow and , due to the low reynolds number , only models flow in the near - wall region .",
    "the flow is not fully turbulent and as a result , the observed flow structures are well organized and a repeating cycle of streak ` busting ' and reformation is observed . in a recent summary",
    ", @xcite concludes that available evidence strongly suggests minimal flow units are representative of dynamics in real large scale turbulent flow . experimental evidence also shows that the details of near - wall bursting are identical for a range of reynolds numbers @xcite .",
    "the minimal channel therefore possess the main attributes of turbulent flow , namely that it is non - laminar , three dimensional , stochastic @xcite and shows significant and irregular variations in both space and time @xcite .",
    "more importantly , due to its minimal size , it is computationally tractable using molecular dynamics .",
    "the first part of the work introduces the modeling methodologies of computational fluid dynamics and molecular dynamics .",
    "a parameter study is then presented to determine the optimal density and temperature to enable a computationally feasible turbulence simulation .",
    "analysis of the flow is performed by identifying identical time evolving turbulent structures in both the molecular and continuum systems . the streak breakdown and vortex regeneration of the minimum channel flow",
    "are demonstrated in the molecular system .",
    "the phase space evolution is compared for the two systems showing the molecular system is behaving in a similar manner to the continuum and that the dynamics are non - laminar .",
    "this is then followed by a range of standard turbulence statistical analysis .",
    "the existence of turbulence at the molecular scale is demonstrated through the agreement between the molecular and continuum solutions .",
    "next , a revised law of the wall is presented including the molecular stacking region which is unique to molecular simulation .",
    "the evolution of various forms of energy is plotted and the interchange between hydrodynamic and thermodynamic energies is discussed .",
    "the impact of different grid - resolutions on the kinetic energy spectrum is explored .",
    "joint probability density functions and lagrangian statistics are employed to gain insight into the sub - grid motions of the molecules .",

    "the energy in the streamwise @xmath120 component , @xmath121 , increases with a finer grid at the expense of the thermal energy , @xmath122 , as flow energy is split between thermal and streaming .",

    "for example in the @xmath19 spectra of figure [ fft ] , the roll structures give a large peak and a range of successive harmonics are clearly observed in the cfd solution .",

    "further low wavelegth peaks in the cfd spectra suggests that further harmonics would also become apparent in the md spectra if even greater averaging was employed .",
    "a range of flow length scales are clearly present in the md minimal channel , as apparent in the energy spectra of fig [ fft ] , while the equivalent size of laminar channel does not display any hierarchy of scales .",
    "one could question where the kolmogorov microscale , @xmath123 , would be located on the spectrum of figure [ fft ] .",
    "although the derivation of a kolmogorov lengthscale assumes a much higher reynolds number , consideration of the minimum eddy length scale at which coherent motion is dissipated to heat is a central concept in cfd modeling . both for ensuring a dns simulation is well resolved and identifying the minimum scale of turbulent eddy .",
    "although the minimum scale does not become apparent in the grid resolution study of figure [ fft ] , molecular dynamics may provide insight into the minimum scale of turbulent eddy . if we assume that the kolmogorov scale is below the observed noise floor and impossible to identify , we consider instead the minimum physical size this eddy could have in the molecular paradigm .",
    "it is possible to view molecular liquids as a series of potential wells , created by the cage like configurational structure of a molecular fluid @xcite .",
    "these molecular cages would typically see three dimensions motion of the molecule trapped within .",
    "this provides an absolute minimum scale for a rotational vortex in a molecular simulation , displayed schematically on figure [ cascade_schematic ] .",
    "although these motions are likely different from the large scale vortical motions observed in the minimal channel , the interplay between inertial and the smallest scales of motions is of great interest .",
