    "the hanle effect is a magnetic field diagnostic that is still relatively unknown among stellar astronomers .",
    "the effect refers to the modification ( either an increase or decrease , as well as a change in position angle ) of resonance line scattering polarization in the presence of a magnetic field , which begins to have an influence at fairly modest ( even small ) field strengths of just a few gauss up to around 300  gauss .",
    "experiments to describe the polarization from resonance line scattering date back primarily to the early 1900 s ( e.g. , see mitchell & zemansky 1934 ) . the influence of a magnetic field on the line polarization was explained first by a young physicist named hanle for his dissertation ( hanle 1924 ) .",
    "he described the effect of the magnetic field in semi - classical terms as arising from the precession of an atomic damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "quantum mechanically , the effect is understood in terms of an interference effect that occurs when the degeneracy of the magnetic sublevels in the excited level is partially lifted , and has applications to many topics in atomic physics ( e.g. , see the review by moruzzi & strumia 1991 ) .",
    "astrophysically , the hanle effect has been applied almost exclusively in the solar context , especially to measuring magnetic fields in the solar chromosphere and corona , and particularly in prominences and filaments ( e.g. , lin , penn , & kuhn 1998 ) . a detailed description of the physics of the hanle effect and polarized radiation transport with application to solar studies appears in stenflo ( 1994 ) .",
    "i began investigating the hanle effect as a means for measuring circumstellar magnetic fields , especially in hot stars , as part of my graduate thesis ( 1996 ) .",
    "this early work appears in ignace , nordsieck , & cassinelli ( 1997 ) , ignace , cassinelli , & nordsieck ( 1999 ) , and ignace ( 2001 ) .",
    "development of the hanle diagnostic continues , and here i wish to summarize its status , as well as observational prospects .",
    "first , i want to begin with a consideration of the more familiar zeeman effect to use as a springboard for discussing the hanle effect .",
    "the strength of the zeeman effect and associated circularly polarized emission depends on the zeeman splitting @xmath2 , as given by    @xmath3    with @xmath4 in microns , @xmath5 in gauss , and @xmath6 the effective lnde factor to generalize the expression . a line in the visible band and a modest magnetic field of around 100  g yields a zeeman splitting of a mere 75 m s@xmath7 .",
    "this is considerably smaller than the thermal broadening typical of stellar envelopes , and much smaller than the velocity broadening in the winds , and this presents a serious difficulty : the circular polarizations of the two zeeman split components are incoherent and oppositely signed , so that their broadening - induced overlap leads to severe polarimetric _",
    "cancellation_. what survives is a much weaker antisymmetric signal .    following stenflo ( 1994 ) , and considering the fields to be `` weak '' ( such that the zeeman splitting is much less than the thermal broadening ) , the first order effect is the longitudinal zeeman effect with stokes @xmath8 given by    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the intensity profile shape in the absence of a magnetic field and @xmath11 , for @xmath12 the magnetic field unit vector and @xmath13 a unit vector directed toward the observer",
    "this expression indicates that the circular polarization will depend on the amount of the zeeman shift , the orientation of the observer with respect to the vector magnetic field , and a gradient of the line profile function .",
    "in the case of a stellar wind , standard expressions for sobolev theory are adopted to describe the line profile formation ( e.g. , mihalas 1978 ) .",
    "an important concept in this theory is the `` isovelocity zone '' .",
    "all of the wind emission that appears at a given frequency in the line profile arises from a zone of fixed doppler shift with respect to the observer .",
    "for example in a radially expanding wind , emission that appears at line center must arise from a surface coincident with the plane of the sky and passing through the center of the star , since the flow in that region has no velocity component along the line - of - sight .",
    "the flux of circular polarization arising from the longitudinal zeeman effect at a point in an isovelocity zone will depend on the line - of - sight gradient of the line source function and the line optical depth ( see ignace & gayley 2003 ) .",
    "the total polarized flux at a given line frequency then requires an integration over the entire isovelocity zone .",
    "figure  1 shows an example for mildly thick recombination lines .",
    "the abscissa for each plot is the wavelength shift @xmath14 from line center as normalized by the maximum shift for the terminal speed flow @xmath15 . at left",
    "is the continuum normalized flux , the three lines being for different optical depths . at right",
    "is the stokes-@xmath8 polarization with @xmath16 .",
    "the percent polarizations are _ extremely _ small , at less than 0.01% !",
    "these low values result primarily from the fact that the gradient factor introduces a scaling that is inversely proportional to the line broadening , which in this case is @xmath17 .",
    "in contrast , the hanle effect is a different method for measuring magnetic fields that is especially well - suited for the circumstellar case .",
    "it should be stressed again that the hanle effect is a _ modification _ of the linear polarization that arises from resonance line scattering .",
    "semi - classically , line scattering can be split into two parts : an isotropic scattering component and a dipole scattering component , like free electrons ( e.g. , hamiton 1947 ; chandrasekhar 1961 ) . the fraction of the scattering that is dipole - like is referred to as the `` polarizability '' , @xmath18 ; the isotropic scattering contribution is given fractionally as @xmath19 .",
    "one can think of resonance scattering in terms of a damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "suppose that a beam of polarized intensity ( 100% ) impinges on a sample of scatterers .",
    "the oscillators are excited and oscillate parallel to the sense of the beam polarization , scattering light anisotropically ( with peak intensity perpendicular to the direction of oscillation and zero intensity along that direction ) .",
    "the introduction of a magnetic field induces a precession of the oscillators .",
    "there are two important points here .",
    "( a )  the atomic oscillators no longer `` bob '' in a fixed direction .",
    "instead , they begin to oscillate in directions perpendicular to the polarization of the incident light .",
    "consequently , one can think of the hanle effect as redistributing energy between orthogonal axes of atomic oscillation .",
    "( b )  the oscillators are damped , emitting their absorbed radiation at a rate given by the einstein @xmath20-value for the transition of interest .",
    "magnetic precession occurs at a rate given by the larmor frequency , @xmath21 .",
    "hence there will be a hanle effect only if these two rates are similar .",
    "i define the `` hanle ratio '' as    @xmath22    typical strong lines are sensitive to the hanle effect for field strengths in the 1 - 300  g range ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "note also that different lines will have different hanle sensitivities . finally , if the hanle ratio is small , the scattering is essentially non - magnetic ( i.e.",
    ", little precession occurs over the lifetime of the level ) , but if the ratio is large , the hanle effect is said to be `` saturated '' . saturated means that the precession is so rapid that little damping of the oscillators occurs after one full rotation , so that to increase the field will not alter the hanle effect .",
    "diagnostically , one loses sensitivity to the field strength , but the scattering polarization still depends on the vector orientation of the magnetic field .",
    "of course , if the field becomes very large indeed , the scattering physics shifts from the hanle effect to the zeeman effect .",
    "there are two main differences that distinguish the use of the hanle effect in studies of the sun versus hot stars .",
    "the first is the fact that the sun is a resolved source , and stars are not .",
    "cassinelli , nordsieck , & ignace ( 2001 ) have also pointed out that in the hot star wind case , the lines are strongly nlte and relatively simple to treat , and the scattering is of a `` flat '' stellar continuum , whereas neither of these is the case for most applications of the hanle effect in the sun .",
    "so to compute polarized profiles of _ wind emission lines _ , standard sobolev theory is once again adopted . for resonance scattering lines ,",
    "sobolev theory yields p  cygni line profiles that are commonly observed from stellar winds ( see lamers & cassinelli 1999 ) .",
    "the single scattering approximation is simply a physically motivated convenience whereby the line emission from optically thick portions of the wind is assumed to be completely unpolarized , and the emission from optically thin portions is assumed to be described by the source functions given in ignace ( 2001 ) . the multiple scattering in thick regions is expected to be depolarized , whereas multiple scattering does not occur in thin regions .",
    "this approach is closely related to the `` last scattering approximation '' that is sometimes employed for static media .      a realistic model for a magnetized wind",
    "is required to produce synthetic polarized line profiles .",
    "wcfields is an axisymmetric semi - analytic model for just such a wind that is based on `` wind compression '' ( wc ) theory . in wc",
    "theory ( bjorkman & cassinelli 1993 ; ignace , cassinelli , & bjorkman 1996 ) , the wind flow from a rotating star is described kinematically .",
    "ignoring pressure gradient terms , and assuming radial wind - driving forces , one can derive an expression for the streamline flow .",
    "the general properties of wc theory have been confirmed with hydrodynamic simulations by owocki , cranmer , & blondin ( 1994 ) , although the effects appear to be inhibited when non - radial accelerations that arise in the line - driving of hot star winds are included ( owocki , cranmer , & gayley 1996 ) .",
    "however , retaining the basic elements of wc  theory , ignace , cassinelli , & bjorkman ( 1998 ) extended the method to allow for `` weak '' magnetic fields .",
    "the key assumptions are that the magnetic field is frozen - in and dominated by the hydrodynamic flow . consequently , the known flow geometry determines the magnetic field topology . referring to ignace et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) for the derivation , the expression that determines the vector magnetic field throughout the flow is    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the surface field strength , @xmath25 is the `` compression factor '' that describes how neighboring streamlines evolve throughout the wind flow , @xmath26 is the vector velocity in the co - rotating frame , and @xmath27 is the radial velocity .",
    "all of the velocity components and the compression factor are knowns .",
    "the scalar strength of the field is given by    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the equatorial rotation speed of the star .",
    "the zero subscript indicates a value at the base of the wind .",
    "the latitude of a streamline varies with radius as flow migrates toward the equator from both the upper and lower hemispheres .",
    "the field is taken to be radial at the wind base , but obtains a toroidal configuration at large radius , with @xmath30 , like the magnetic field that is dragged out in the solar wind .",
    "for the slow rotations that will be considered here , the factor @xmath25 varies little from pole to equator and so is ignored .",
    "additionally , @xmath31 is generally smaller than either @xmath32 or @xmath33 , and is also ignored .",
    "the resulting model is a spherically symmetric wind with a complex radial and toroidal magnetic field morphology .",
    "using wcfields theory for slowly rotating stars , polarized emission profiles from p  cygni lines have been computed and are shown in figure  3 .",
    "the rotation was chosen to be 8% of the terminal speed .",
    "since most o  star winds have terminal speeds of around 2000 km s@xmath7 , the equatorial rotation speed would be around 150 km s@xmath7 , which is not atypical of observed @xmath34 values ( penny 1996 ) .",
    "especially important is the fact that the wind is assumed to be spherically symmetric . in wcfields theory , this model would have a mild equator - to - pole density contrast of 1.25 asymptotically .",
    "the wind is taken to be explicitly spherical to isolate the influence of the hanle effect , since an unresolved spherically symmetric distribution of scatterers would otherwise yield no net polarization .",
    "the different profiles are for different surface field strengths as indicated .",
    "the upper frames are for the stokes @xmath0 profile , and the lower for stokes  @xmath1 .",
    "the left panels are for the wrong field topology and the right is for the correct one .",
    "the wrong case assumes a surface magnetic field that is initially outward radial  a monopole , which violates the condition @xmath35@xmath36 over a closed surface .",
    "the panels at right are for a surface field that is initially a split monopole , with field lines outward radial in the upper hemisphere and inward radial in the lower hemisphere . in every case",
    "the star is viewed as edge - on .",
    "the two cases are shown to illustrate how the hanle effect can be used to glean information about the magnetic field .",
    "what is immediately striking is that the surface monopole case yields a net @xmath1-profile , whereas the surface split monopole case does not .",
    "so the @xmath1-profile is a sensitive probe of the field symmetry ( such as top - bottom and left - right ) .",
    "the @xmath0-profile also depends on the field symmetry , but simplistically , the @xmath0-profile shows stronger polarizations for larger surface fields , and can thus be considered a gauge of the surface field strength . note that the surface fields rise up to 1500  g in these examples .",
    "such large values are beyond the hanle effect and firmly in the zeeman regime ( stenflo 1998 ) .",
    "however , in these models , the inner wind is quite optically thick in the line opacity , and only the outer wind is thin ( e.g. , some portions of the wind start to become thin around @xmath37 ) .",
    "it is only these thin portions that contribute to the hanle effect in the single scattering approximation , and at these radii the field is considerably reduced relative to the surface value .    in summary , significant linear polarizations in the line of a few tenths of a percent",
    "can result from the hanle effect , and the influence of the line optical depth is to ensure that for typical p  cygni lines , the hanle effect will probe circumstellar magnetic fields at intermediate radii of a few @xmath38 in the wind , even if the wind is spherical . for cases",
    "when the wind is distorted from spherical , as one would expect from a magnetized flow , polarizations from more than one line , each having a different hanle sensivitity , will generally be needed to disentangle the effects of the magnetic field from that of the non - spherical geometry .",

    "the far ultraviolet spectropolarimeter ( fusp ) is a sounding rocket payload that is expected to launch in autumn 2003 .",
    "the goal of the mission will be to make spectropolarimetric measurements in the wavelength range of 10501500    for several different targets ( see tab .  1 ) . with a 50  cm primary",
    ", the instrument will have a spectral resolution of 0.65   , corresponding to @xmath47 at a wavelength of 1170   .",
    "this in turn corresponds to a velocity resolution of about 170  km  s@xmath7 , which is sufficient to resolve wind - broadened lines with typical full widths of a few thousand km  s@xmath7 .",
    "targeting the star @xmath40  ori , which was observed in the fuv with copernicus , it is anticipated that fusp will produce the first detection of the hanle effect in a star other than the sun .",
    "this contribution has focussed on the hanle effect in resonance scattering lines common to hot star winds .",
    "the study of the effect and the development of radiative transport techniques is ongoing , especially in terms of relaxing the single scattering approximation for the line polarization .",
    "the description presented here ignores the influence of nuclear spin for the polarizability @xmath18 of a particular transition , but nuclear spin can have a significant effect on its value ( e.g. , nordsieck 2001 ) .",
    "we have also ignored the influence of fluorescent alignment , which affects the populations of the magnetic sublevels .",
    "fluorescent alignment is also subject to magnetic `` re - alignment '' effects , which are related to the hanle effect and operate at much weaker field strengths ( see nordsieck 2001 ) .",
