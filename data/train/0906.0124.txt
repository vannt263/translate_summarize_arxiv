    "this allows us to infer how the dark matter is concentrated around galaxies and galaxy clusters , as well as providing a testing ground for dark energy and modified gravity theories @xcite .    in this paper",

    "we suggest that topological defects in the cosmic shear can be used as a probe of the gravitational potential generated by the lensing mass fluctuations on large scales .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows . in  2 , the basic formalism of weak gravitational lensing and the criteria to identify topological defects in shear fields",

    "4 we turn to the case of a random mass distribution whose gravitational potential is a gaussian variable that describes the stochastic geometry of a surface .",
    "this assumption ( valid on large angular scales ) allows us to express the defect density in terms of the two point correlation function of the gravitational potential .",
    "the latter is estimated for the standard cold dark matter model for large - scale structure in the universe and compared to the results of simulations .",
    "corrections for weakly non - gaussian fields can be calculated using perturbation theory as discussed in  5 where ideas for further work are briefly sketched .",
    "in this section , we review the basic formalism of gravitational lensing that relates the deformation of the shapes of background galaxy images to the projected mass density responsible for lensing .      consider a source whose true angular position on the sky makes an angle @xmath2 with an arbitrary optic axis . as a result of the lensing , an observer sees the light ray as coming from an image at an angle @xmath3 ( from the optic axis ) that differs from @xmath2 by the ( reduced ) deflection angle @xmath4 .",
    "these angular displacements can also be viewed as two dimensional vectors @xmath5 on a locally flat sky ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these vectors are related by : @xmath6 .    in this notation , the image distortion caused by gravitational lensing",
    "is locally described by @xmath7 , the jacobian matrix of the transformation between @xmath8 and @xmath9 which reads @xmath10 where we used the relation @xmath11 @xmath12 between the deflection angle and the gradient of the projected ( two - dimensional ) newtonian potential @xmath13 .",
    "the latter satisfies the poisson equation @xmath14 where the convergence , @xmath15 , is given by the weighted projection of the mass density fluctuation field , see ref .",

    "the local orientation of the shear can be visualized by means of a line field , that is to say a vector @xmath34 with both ends identified @xmath35 .",

    "topological defects are analogous to localized regions of quantized magnetic flux with charge proportional to the winding number @xmath36 , and @xmath37 plays the role of the electromagnetic gauge field .",
    "the ( shear ) field lines corresponding to topological defects of different indexes are reproduced schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : defects ] .",
    "the symmetry of the shear field requires that the defect index @xmath36 must be a half - integer .",

    "global rotations by a constant angle at every point in the flat sky , @xmath44 , do not change the index of a topological defect since the definition in eq .",

    "[ fig : defects ] has the same @xmath45 index as a sink which is obtained from the vortex by a @xmath46 rotation .",
    "this invariance distinguishes the topological classification adopted in this work from the more common e - b modes classification adopted in previous studies of the cmb polarization field and of gravitational lensing .",
    "for example a 45 degree rotation of each shear around an @xmath45 defect does not change its topological charge , but it changes an e mode to a b mode .",
    "in this study , we concentrate on global topological features of the shear field whose positions on the sky are related ( non - locally ) to the large scale mass fluctuations responsible for the lensing .",
    "in this section , we derive the connection that exists between the topological defects in the shear field and the projected gravitational potential @xmath13 generated by the mass fluctuations .",
    "it is convenient to view @xmath47 as the height function of a non - intersecting two dimensional surface . in the weak lensing regime ,",
    "the derivatives of the potential @xmath12 are small ; the differential geometry of the surface is then approximated by the properties of the hessian @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "we show that the shear direction corresponds to the principal direction of maximal curvature on the surface , provided that @xmath48 .",
    "on such a two dimensional surface , we can step away from any given point in an infinite number of directions so that for each direction a curvature is defined .",
    "as the direction is smoothly varied , two perpendicular directions of _ principal curvatures _ can be found for which the curvature is maximal and minimal .",
    "the two principal curvatures , henceforth denoted by @xmath49 , are the eigenvalues of the hessian matrix @xmath20 : @xmath50 the eigenvectors give the local directions of the principal axes .",
    "since the magnitude of the shear field @xmath19 is positive , @xmath51 corresponds to the principal direction of maximal curvature .",
    "the hessian matrix @xmath20 determines the deformation matrix @xmath7 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) . upon comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq:5bis ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) and the discussion following it , we can conclude that the direction of maximal curvature is the shear direction along which a reference circular source is stretched most by the lensing potential ( eg . it points along the major axis of the ellipse in fig .",

    "the two principal curvatures are equal when @xmath52 is equal to zero .",
    "this defines the umbilical points of the surface : points where the principal directions are undefined and the surface is locally spherical or flat @xcite .",

    "( [ eq:3 ] ) must vanish , because its local direction is undetermined .",
    "_ this ensures that the two principal curvatures are equal . as a result ,",
    "topological defects of the shear field can be identified as the umbilical points of the induced surface .",
    "_ indeed the umbilical points can be classified according to the index of the principal direction vector field , which is either @xmath53 or @xmath54 at an umbilical point .",
    "as we shall see this corresponds to topological defects of index @xmath55 in the shear field .",
    "the local angle @xmath56 by which the coordinate axis needs to be rotated to overlap with the principal axes ( given by the eigenvectors of the hessian of the height function @xmath12 ) is @xmath57    a comparison of eq .",

    "thus the principal direction of maximal curvature on the surface tracks the shear field .    in the next sections",
    "we will show how this mathematical mapping leads to connections between the defect locations and the distribution of mass that generates the gravitational potential .",
    "in addition the identification between topological defects and umbilical points of a random surface will allow us to relate the density of defects to statistical quantities such as the two - point correlation function of the projected gravitational field .",
    "in practice , one would attempt to identify defects either in direct experimental measurements of shear using galaxy images , or ray tracing computer simulations that provide the shear field on a discrete grid . in both cases , it is necessary to consider how to interpret the notion of a defect ( introduced via eq .",

    "we have carried out such a measurement using the net change in the angle @xmath4 around closed loops at each pixel vertex , using techniques similar to those of @xcite .",

    "we have also checked this for a non - singular logarithmic potential .    hence , the separation of the two nearby defects is a measure of the ellipticity of the haloes .",
    "this is potentially useful since large - scale structure studies have shown that the mass distribution in the universe can be well approximated ( especially for statistical purposes ) as a network of elliptical halos of varying mass and concentration @xcite . thus our approach facilitates the interpretation of observed shear fields , as we discuss further below .",
