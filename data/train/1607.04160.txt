    "we reveal that non - stationary spin - polarized currents can flow in the both leads and their direction and polarization depend on the value of applied bias .",
    "moreover , non - stationary spin - polarized currents simultaneously change their polarization and sign with the applied bias voltage variations .",
    "we consider non - stationary processes in the system of single - level impurity placed between two non - magnetic electronic reservoirs ( tunneling junction ) with coulomb correlations of localized electrons .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system    @xmath1    is written as a sum of the single - level anderson impurity hamiltonian    @xmath2    non - magnetic electronic reservoirs hamiltonian    @xmath3    and the tunneling part    @xmath4    here index @xmath5 labels continuous spectrum states in the leads , @xmath6 is the tunneling transfer amplitude between continuous spectrum states and localized state with the energy @xmath7 which is considered to be independent on the momentum and spin .",
