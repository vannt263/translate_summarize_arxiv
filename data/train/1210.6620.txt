    "in november 2008 , two teams announced what were described as the first directly imaged extrasolar planets around the nearby young stars hr 8799 and fomalhaut @xcite .",
    "numerous studies recovered the three hr 8799 planets in archival data @xcite ; recent ones identify a fourth planet ( hr 8799e , marois et al . 2010 ; currie et al .",
    "2011a ) with a similar spectrum @xcite .",
    "detailed dynamical and atmospheric modeling confirms that hr 8799 bcde are bona fide planets , not brown dwarfs ( @xmath4 @xmath5 9 @xmath3 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , refereed follow - up studies have yet to confirm fomalhaut b , casting serious doubt on its status . as noted by @xcite , fomalhaut b",
    "s spectrum looks little like that expected for a substellar object , as it is detected in the optical but not in the infrared .",
    "deeper ir data do not recover fomalhaut b @xcite .",
    "@xcite describe fomalhaut b s emission as being dominated by scattered dust emission surrounding a planet , with a thermal component at 0.8 @xmath0 and accretion - driven variability at 0.6 @xmath0 .",
    "however , @xcite argue , based on their detection limits , that essentially none of the optical emission originates from a planet , the 0.6 @xmath0 variability instead identifies a semi - transient dust cloud and thus fomalhaut b is not a directly imaged planet . while fomalhaut b seems to be a natural explanation for the well - confined debris ring @xcite , shepherding planets unassociated with fomalhaut b may provide an alternate explanation @xcite .    these doubts about fomalhaut b s status call for new data to further constrain its ir emission and a reanalysis of the hst data from which fomalhaut b was originally identified .",
    "thus , in this letter , we present new subaru / ircs j band imaging of fomalhaut and a rereduction of @xcite s hst / acs data .",
    "we use these data to constrain the near - ir emission from any planet corresponding to fomalhaut b and revisit key results of @xcite : 1 ) fomalhaut b s existence , 2 ) its spectrum , 3 ) 0.6 @xmath0 variability , and 4 ) its orbit .",
    "* subaru / ircs data *  we imaged fomalhaut on 2009 aug 16 in the mauna kea @xmath6 band filter behind the 08 coronographic spot with the infrared camera and spectrograph ( ircs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the ao-188 adaptive optics system ( full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) = 006 ; 20.53 mas pixel@xmath7 ) in observing blocks bracketing hr 8799 observations @xcite in _ angular differential imaging _ ( adi ) mode @xcite . between the two observing blocks",
    ", we rotated the instrument by @xmath8 70@xmath9 to keep the region covering fomalhaut b visible on the detector ( @xmath10pa @xmath8 94@xmath9 ) .",
    "basic image processing follows steps listed in @xcite .",
    "* hst / acs data and basic processing *  we downloaded hst / acs data for fomalhaut taken in the f435w , f606w , and f814w filters taken in 2004 and 2006 ( program ids 10390 and 10598 ) from the mast archive and processed with the opus pipeline . the distortion - corrected acs data are pocketed by cosmic - ray hits .",
    "we flag most of these cosmic rays in individual subimages by identifying 10-@xmath11 outliers in concentric annuli roughly centered on the star in a median - filtered image with a moving - box length of 10 pixels we register images by subtracting the first image in the sequence by a 180@xmath9 rotation of itself , identifying the centroid position that minimizes the residuals , and then cross - correlating this image with the others to derive relative offsets .",
    "we reform the subimages together into datacubes , mean - combining them with @xmath12-@xmath11 outlier clipping to mitigate other cosmic - rays and hot pixels , iteratively choosing the exact settings to maximize the signal - to - noise of background objects ( derived at the end of our image processing : next subject heading ) .",
    "* psf subtraction *  we explored a range of methods to subtract the stellar point - spread function ( psf ) , including reference psf subtraction , roll subtraction / adi - based psf subtraction , loci , and adaptive loci or a - loci ( * ? ? ? * t. currie , 2012 in prep . ) . for the subaru data , we obtain the best sensitivity using loci ( a - loci yielded no improvement ) .",
    "for the f435w and f814w data , the small number of images or random noise sources reduce ( a)loci s effectiveness .",
    "we obtain the smallest subtraction residuals by performing roll subtraction separately for each integration time and averaging the results .    for the f606w data ,",
    "a - loci provides the best results .",
    "the @xcite version filters images by their degree of speckle correlation and determines the combination of algorithm parameters that maximize the snr of point sources . here , we add two components .",
    "first , we add a  moving pixel mask \" , where the algorithm is prevented from using , in the psf construction , pixels lying within the annular region we want to subtract ( the subtraction zone , see marois et al .",
    "2010b ; soummer et al .",
    "second , we also include frames from the reference star vega in our a - loci psf construction .",
    "as shown in figure [ f606wim ] , we easily recover fomalhaut b in all f606w data sets . with the noise defined in concentric annuli , the signal - to - noise ratios ( snr ) are snr = 16 for the 30 2006 data ( top - left panel ) , 9 for the 18 2004 data ( top - right panel ) , and @xmath8 8 for the 2006 18 data ( not shown ) ; the corresponding a - loci parameters are @xmath10 = [ 1,1,1 ] , @xmath13 = [ 125 , 150 , 125 ] , @xmath14 = [ 1,1,1 ] , @xmath15 = [ 10,5,5 ] , and @xmath16 = [ 0.9,0.5,0.7 ] . defining the significance of our detection within a 510 pixel annulus surrounding fomalhaut b , we get snr @xmath8 10.2 , 14.1 , and 16.4 for the 2006 18 data , 30 data , and the combined data ( bottom panel ) and snr @xmath8 12.7 for the 2004 data .",
    "these estimates are about a factor of 2 higher than the best snr estimates from @xcite ( snr @xmath8 8 ; p. kalas , pvt . comm . ) .",
    "the images include a background star ( @xmath17 ( 2006 ) = 142 , 203@xmath18 ) and two background galaxies ( @xmath17 ( 2006 ) = 108 , 135@xmath18 ; @xmath17 ( 2006 ) = 187 , 234@xmath18 ) .",
    "we do not conclusively identify any other candidate companions at 5-@xmath11 , including at the location of @xcite s candidate nor within the debris ring .",
    "we also recover the f814w detection reported by @xcite and report a new f435w detection of fomalhaut b ( snr @xmath8 6 ) ( figure [ otherwvlh ] ) .",
    "however , we do not detect fomalhaut b in the subaru / j band data ( figure [ otherwvlh ] ) .    to measure fomalhaut b s brightness in the hst data and to quantify subaru upper limits , we use aperture photometry and determine / correct for throughput losses as in @xcite .",
    "fomalhaut b is nearly unattenuated in a - loci reductions , a fact confirmed by comparing the f606w brightness of fomalhaut b with photometry using reference psf subtraction .",
    "for the 2006 f606w data , we derive a brightness of @xmath19 = 24.97 @xmath20 0.09 . in the 2004 f606w data , we derive @xmath19 = 24.92 @xmath20 0.10 .",
    "fomalhaut b has not measurably varied in brightness between the two epochs , a result that appears insensitive to our choice of reduction method .",
    "photometry at f435w and f814w imply that fomalhaut b is near zero color ( @xmath21 = 25.22 @xmath20 0.18 , @xmath22 = 24.91 @xmath20 0.20 ) .",
    "our 5-@xmath11 subaru / j band limits are @xmath19 @xmath23 22.22 .",
    "we determine fomalhaut b s position from the highest snr data at each epoch ( f606w ) , fitting a gaussian profile ( fwhm = 2.7 pixels ) .",
    "the astrometric uncertainties consider the intrinsic snr , our precision in deriving absolute astrometric calibration , and differences in positions derived from the full range of psf subtraction methods ( reference psf subtraction , loci , a - loci ) .",
    "fomalhaut b s position changes in the 2006 ( 2004 ) data by @xmath11[e , n ] @xmath8 [ 10 , 10 ] mas ( [ 15 , 5 ] mas ) depending on exactly how we do the psf subtraction .",
    "the snr for fomalhaut b and background objects is insensitive ( @xmath10snr @xmath2 510% ) to centroid offsets @xmath2 13 mas ( 0.5 pixels ) from the position that minimizes the subtraction residuals ( see  2 , paragraph 3 ) .",
    "our analyses yield a 2006 position of [ e , n ] = [ -8.615 , 9.352 ] @xmath20 [ 0.016 , 0.016 ] and 2004 position of [ -8.598 , 9.209 ] @xmath20 [ 0.020 , 0.014 ] .",
    "@xcite s astrometry shows good agreement with ours in the 2004 @xmath24 coordinate but otherwise differs by @xmath8 0.51 pixels .",
    "their astrometry also implies a larger space motion of @xmath25 018 vs. our @xmath25 014 .        to interpret the infrared non - detections , we use the planet atmosphere models in @xcite for 110 @xmath3 companions and @xcite for 0.51 @xmath3 companions .",
    "our comparisons help to determine whether any planet masses are consistent with the combined upper limits and with the range of masses needed for fomalhaut to sculpt the debris ring . here , we consider an age range of 100500 myr , encompassing age estimates from individual indicators in @xcite , where the best - estimated age is @xmath8 450 myr .",
    "figure [ seds ] compares several classes of models to the optical detections and the ir upper limits .",
    "the optical sed matches the spectrum of light from fomalhaut ( blue - green line ) scattered by small dust .",
    "optical photospheric predictions for the planet models are more than 5 magnitudes fainter than the 0.40.6 @xmath0 emission .",
    "although the optical detections lie well above model predictions for gas giant planets , @xcite s the 5-@xmath11 irac upper limit restricts fomalhaut b s mass to less than 2 @xmath3 for even the oldest ages .",
    "the @xmath6-band data also restrict fomalhaut b s mass to be @xmath2 2 @xmath3 for younger ages , though useful limits at 400500 myr are entirely due to the irac data .",
    "however , the ground - based / spitzer ir limits are still bright enough to be consistent with fomalhaut b being a gas giant planet that sculpts the debris ring .",
    "the 5-@xmath11 irac upper limits are comparable to the predicted brightness of a 400 myr - old , 1 @xmath3 planet from both the @xcite and @xcite models .",
    "the @xcite upper limits are still @xmath8 3 ( 30 ) times brighter than a 0.5 @xmath3 planet at ( 120 ) 500 myr , which is massive enough to sculpt the debris ring : in fact , this low mass is favored by detailed dynamical simulations @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , a dust cloud producing fomalhaut b s optical emission ( @xmath26 = 24.95 ) at 119 au requires a minimum cross - sectional area of @xmath27 @xmath25 1.3@xmath2810@xmath29/@xmath30 @xmath25 1.3@xmath2810@xmath29 @xmath31 . for spherically distributed dust",

    "the timescale for orbital shear to broaden a dust cloud of initial radius @xmath32 into a region of radius @xmath34 with orbital period @xmath36 is @xmath37 @xmath25 ( @xmath34/@xmath32)p @xcite .    from this keplerian shear alone , an unbound dust cloud at the separation of fomalhaut b",
    "would then smooth out into a resolvable ( @xmath34 @xmath23 0.26 au ) clump in 56,000 yr and a circumstellar ring in @xmath25 25 myr ( @xmath25 1/18th of fomalhaut s age ) .",
    "other dust grain removal mechanisms ( radiation pressure , poynting - robertson drag ) operate on similar / shorter timescales . *",

    "next , we compare fomalhaut b s motion with the debris ring geometry , calculating the minimum distance between the companion and the disk midpoint ( in angular separation ) .",
    "we explored a range of psf subtraction methods for f606w 2004 - 2006 data sets to identify the combination that yields a high snr image of the disk with minimal levels of self - subtraction .",
    "based on these criteria , we use the a psf subtracted image of the 2006 f606w data obtained under the 30 spot with vega as the reference star .    to model the disk and compute the planet - disk separation",
    ", we explored two methods to assess the robustness of our results . *",
    "method 1 *  we first select a wide annulus enclosing the disk emission , mask pixels with intensities roughly less than the 1-@xmath11 noise floor ( 0.005 cts / s ) and determine a least - squares ellipse fit to the data .",
    "we perform these steps for the raw image and a 10-pixel gaussian smoothed image , average the results , and report the differences in the results as the fit uncertainties .",
    "* method 2 *  we divided the disk into 0.5@xmath9 annular sections and fit the disk center at each section four different ways :    * * 1 * a high - order polynomial fit to the surface brightness ( sb ) as a function of distance , taking the maximum value as the disk spine . * * 2 * a gaussian fit to the sb with the maximum of the gaussian as the disk spine . * * 3 * the peak pixel value * * 4 * the mean distance from all points @xmath23 90% the value of the peak pixel as identifying the disk spine .",
    "we then averaged the separately - determined disk radii , calculated x , y positions of the disk spine and uncertainties , and derived a least - squares ellipse fit . as with method 1 , we performed these steps on the raw image ( 5-pixel binning ) and a gaussian smoothed image ( 3-pixel binning ) .",
    "figure [ seds ] ( right panel ) depicts our ellipse fitting from method 1 .",
    "compared to @xcite , we obtain similar values for the disk properties . from method 1 ,",
    "we obtain 137.6 @xmath20 0.5 au , 61.6 @xmath20 0.1 au , and 156.7 @xmath20 0.2@xmath9 for the disk major axis , minor axis , and position angle . from method 2 ,",
    "we obtain 140.9 @xmath20 1.7 au , 58.0 @xmath20 0.3 au , and 156.6 @xmath20 0.2@xmath9 . from method 1",
    ", fomalhaut b appears to move closer to the disk by 0026 ( 1715 to 1689 ) , whereas method 2 yields an even smaller deviation of 0002 ( 1712 to 1710 ) .",
    "this change is less than or equal to our quadrature - added astrometric errors for either the coordinate ( @xmath41 = [ 0.026 , 0.021 ] ) and is not statistically significant .",
    "thus , acs astrometry is consistent with fomalhaut b being in a ring - nested orbit and near apsidal alignment .",
    "however , uncertainties in the astrometry and disk fitting and the small number of data points do not yet rule out a ring - crossing orbit . @xmath25 24.8 @xmath20 0.2 ) .",
    "fomalhaut b s",
    "position is significantly less discrepant compared to the disk ( @xmath25 01015 @xmath20 01 ) if we adopt the acs ellipse parameters . any uncorrected image distortion , clearly flagged as a problem by @xcite , will bias image registration by yielding erroneous determinations for where the diffraction spikes intersect ( e.g. the stellar centroid ) .",
    "stis astrometry of fomalhaut b obtained at multiple epochs will better clarify its orbit ( kalas et al .",
    "2012 , in prep . ) .",
    "@xcite argue that scattered starlight in a circumplanetary ring system contributes significantly to the f606w emission and planet thermal radiation dominates the f814w emission .",
    "they find the 0.6 @xmath0 emission variable by 0.70.8 mag , explainable by accretion - driven @xmath42 emission , not dust emission .",
    "in contrast ,",
    "@xcite argue that planet thermal emission can not measurably contribute to the 0.60.8 @xmath0 emission else fomalhaut b ( if a planet ) should have been detected at 4.5 @xmath0 .",
    "based on the ir nondetections , the large implied space velocity from the acs data , the f606w variability , and the difficulty in a circumplanetary ring scattering enough starlight , @xcite instead argue that fomalhaut b is a ( semi-)transient dust cloud physically unassociated with any planet .",
    "we recover @xcite s detections at f606w and f814w and add a f435w detection , confirming that fomalhaut b is a real object orbiting the primary .",
    "we can not confirm that fomalhaut b s f606w emission is variable at a level larger than our combined photometric errors ( @xmath25 0.15 mag ) , let alone by 0.70.8 mags , and thus do not find any evidence for accretion - driven emission _ nor _ for a _ semi - transient _ dust cloud .",
    "based on the irac and ( to a lesser extent ) @xmath6-band upper limits , we agree that fomalhaut b s optical emission contains no measurable contribution from a planetary photosphere .",
    "thus , in the strictest sense of the word , fomalhaut b is not yet a _ directly imaged _ planet .",
    "however , a 0.5 @xmath3 planet  favored by @xcite s simulations  is too faint to be detectable in _ any _ existing ir data set . * _ thus , the ir non - detections provide no compelling evidence against fomalhaut b being the planet sculpting fomalhaut s debris ring_*. fomalhaut b",
    "s acs positions appear to be consistent with those expected for a ring - nested orbit . moreover , fomalhaut b s implied space motion is significantly slower and much more consistent with that expected for an apsidally aligned object .",
    "our astrometry then weakens the other argument in @xcite s against fomalhaut b being a planet sculpting the debris ring .",
    "finally , fomalhaut b is unlikely to be an unbound dust cloud since such a cloud would shear out into a resolvable clump on very short timescales and eventually into a circumstellar ring ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , a dust cloud gravitationally bound to a planet _ can _ in principle explain the optical sed and persist for much longer timescales .",
    "though dust confined to an optically - thick circumplanetary ring @xcite may not scatter enough starlight @xcite , a spherical cloud of circumplanetary dust originating from ongoing planetesimal collisions @xcite is still plausible .",
    "fomalhaut b is a rare , possibly unique object in the primary s circumstellar environment .",
    "although the emission identifying it originates from dust , not a planet atmosphere , it just happens to be where a massive planet should be in order to sculpt the debris ring . if a planet , it is ( as yet ) an indirect detection , but this is a feature shared by the protoplanet lkca 15 b @xcite and radial - velocity / transit / microlensing - detected planets",
    "thus , fomalhaut b is very plausibly ( even likely )  a planet identified from direct imaging \" even if images of it , strictly speaking , do not show thermal emission from a directly imaged planet .",
