    "the _ random assignment setting _ captures the scenario in which @xmath0 agents express preferences over @xmath0 objects and the outcome is a probabilistic assignment . for the the setting , two interesting efficiency notions are ex post efficiency and sd ( stochastic dominance)-efficiency  @xcite .",

    "consider the social choice setting in which there is a set of agents @xmath1 , a set of alternatives @xmath2 and a preference profile @xmath3 such that each @xmath4 is a complete and transitive relation over @xmath5 .",
    "we write  @xmath6 to denote that agent  @xmath7 values alternative  @xmath8 at least as much as alternative  @xmath9 and use  @xmath10 for the strict part of  @xmath4 , i.e. ,  @xmath11 iff  @xmath6 but not  @xmath12 .",
    "finally , @xmath13 denotes  @xmath7 s indifference relation , i.e. , @xmath14 iff both  @xmath6 and  @xmath12 .",
    "the alternatives in @xmath5 could be any discrete structures : voting outcomes , house allocation , many - to - many two - sided matching , or coalition structures .",

    "a utility profile is _ consistent _ with the preference profile @xmath19 , if for each @xmath16 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 if @xmath22 . two alternatives @xmath20 are _ pareto indifferent _ if @xmath23 for all @xmath16 . for any alternative @xmath24 , we will denote by @xmath25 the set @xmath26 .",
    "we will also consider randomized outcomes that are lotteries over @xmath5 .",

    "lottery @xmath42 swdominates @xmath30 if for any utility profile for which @xmath30 maximizes welfare , @xmath42 maximises welfare , and there exists at least one utility profile for which @xmath42 maximised welfare but @xmath30 does not",
