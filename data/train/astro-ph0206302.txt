    "identification of two tens of the long grb ( @xmath9 ) with the extragalactic objects located at cosmological distances ( @xmath10 ) raises a question about the source of energy release . for the spherical symmetry",
    "the energy yield is turned to be as abnormally large as @xmath11 only in the band of thousands of @xmath12 .",
    "such energy release is comparable with that of a supernova explosion ( sn ) , for which @xmath13 of the energy is escaped by neutrinos during the first several seconds . to overcome the energy catastrophe in the problem of grb a hypothesis",
    "was suggested about a strong collimation of the gamma radiation in the narrow solid angle of @xmath14 .",
    "this assumption gives a possibility to diminish the luminosity of grb , needed for the explanation of the observed gamma - ray flux , by a factor of @xmath15 which for @xmath14 gives the gain of @xmath16 .",
    "such directivity can be explained by the radiation of a narrow jet of particles accelerated to relativistic energies .",
    "however , it is not clear now how this jet is formed when two compact objects merge or when one of them explodes .",
    "that is why there exists a large amount of models suggested for grb explanation , @xcite . in last years the model of strong anisotropic supernova explosion becomes very popular ( see , for example , @xcite ) , which demands extreme conditions for its realization .",
    "our model suggests the mechanism of origin of a narrow beam of gamma - rays when a shock of an sn explosion in the binary system , containing a magnetized neutron star or a white dwarf , is interacting with its magnetosphere .",
    "if the observer is placed in the plane of the orbit of such a binary system and at the moment of the origin of the magnetospheric tail the line of observation coincides with the tail direction , then a grb will be observed .",
    "we give the estimations confirming that our model can explain the general properties of grb , both long ( @xmath17 )  cosmological , and short ( @xmath18 )  possibly local .",
    "for the short grb we consider the binary system in which one companion , as previously , is a neutron star or a white dwarf and another is a star of cataclysmic flare variable .",
    "as an example we discuss a binary stellar system with a distance between the companions of @xmath19 .",
    "the system consists of a blue giant - supernova progenitor ( @xmath20 ) and a magnetized neutron star ( @xmath21 ) or a magnetized white dwarf ( @xmath22 ) . according to the review @xcite",
    "the parameters of the shock are    kinetic energy @xmath23 ,    velocity @xmath24 ,    density @xmath25 ,    width @xmath26 .    under the impact of the shock on the dipole magnetic field of a neutron star or a white dwarf a magnetospheric tail forms , aligned along shock wave propagation .",
    "the magnetospheric magnetic field is amplified and compressed by the cumulative effect , forming the narrow tail .",
    "the dependencies of the magnitude of the magnetic field in the tail @xmath27 and the tail s diameter @xmath28 on the distance to the center of the compact star @xmath29 follow from the condition of freezing of the magnetic field into the shock plasma and the conservation of the magnetic field flux @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the alfven radius @xmath32 where the magnetic field pressure is equal to the pressure of the shock matter ; @xmath33 is the value of the magnetic field on the alfven radius @xmath34 the length of the tail @xmath35 is of the order of shock s width @xmath36 , @xmath37 thus , a stretched ( @xmath38 ) , magnetized ( @xmath39 ) , almost parallel magnetospheric tail forms with a stored magnetic energy @xmath40 , @xmath41 for neutron stars and for white dwarfs the values of @xmath42 are equal to @xmath43 respectively .",
    "we see that for a not very compact pair ( @xmath44 ) a part of the energy caught from the total kinetic energy of the shock of the sn explosion is @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the white dwarfs and the neutron stars . , that is typical of a compact sn of ib / c type .",
    "for the ia type @xmath47 may @xmath48 times larger . ] the energy caught increases as @xmath49 for a closer binary system .",
    "for the narrow directivity of gamma radiation @xmath50 from the relativistic particles ( @xmath3 ) , when the magnetospheric tail is directed to the observer , it is natural to obtain the effective power needed for the cosmological grb .",
    "the rate of grb of @xmath51 for a total number of @xmath52 galaxies of a visible universe gives the rate per one galaxy of the order of @xmath53 .",
    "if we assume the rate of sn explosions in one young galaxy as @xmath54 , then we obtain that approximately @xmath55 sn explosions result in one grb .",
    "this corresponds to the directivity of gamma radiation of @xmath56 .",
    "the lifetime of the tail is defined by the annihilation of its magnetic field @xmath57 ( @xmath58 is the alfven velocity ) and is equal to the time of its forming @xmath59 .",
    "it is @xmath60 .",
    "the non - stationarity and the reconnection of the magnetic field in the tail ( note that the magnetic field is antiparallel at the opposite sides of the tail ) lead to the appearance of a strong electric field @xmath61 accelerating particles . their mean lorentz factor @xmath62 can be estimated from the equilibrium between the acceleration rate and synchrotron losses of fast particles in the magnetic field @xmath33 , @xmath63 the characteristic value of the lorentz factor of accelerated electrons ( and positrons ) is @xmath64 . in the magnetic field",
    "@xmath65 particles of such energies radiate at the frequency @xmath66 , which corresponds to the photon energy @xmath67 , typical of a gamma burst .",
    "in some cases the magnetospheric tail produced by the interaction of a sn shock with a magnetosphere of a magnetized companion can be torn due to a global reconnecton of its magnetic field lines ( tearing instability ) .",
    "such kind of phenomenon is observed during intense chromospheric flares on the sun . as a result",
    ", part of the tail can be torn off and obtain high kinetic energy .",
    "it will move with a lorentz factor @xmath68 , which is almost equal to the factor @xmath62 , estimated early in ( 7 ) , @xmath7 .",
    "thus , a narrow , magnetized , relativistic jet is moving towards the observer .    in the frame",
    "moving together with the jet , let the magnetic field strength be @xmath69 , the particle density be @xmath70 , the mean lorentz factor of particles be @xmath62 .",
    "due to synchrotron loses the value of @xmath62 will decrease . inside the jet microreconnection processes will support the equipartision between the magnetic energy and the particle energy , @xmath71 . besides",
    ", particles are frozen into the magnetic field , and their density is proportional to the magnetic field strength , @xmath72 . the index `` 0 '' is related to the initial values of the parameters .",
    "it follows that @xmath73 during the adiabatic expansion of the jet s diameter with the conservation of the magnetic flux , @xmath74 , the quantities @xmath70 and @xmath69 will decrease in time .",
    "because of the optical depth with respect to the thompson scattering is small @xmath75 for our parameters ( @xmath76 ) we can consider that the synchrotron radiation escapes freely .",
    "so , the jet s cooling is associated with the synchrotron losses @xmath77 here @xmath78 is the induced electric field arising due to the change of the magnetic field , @xmath79 . from (",
    "8) we obtain the equation describing the evolution of the mean particle energy @xmath80 = -\\frac{2e^4 } { 3m^3 c^5}\\left ( \\frac{8\\pi mc^2n_0}{b_0}\\right ) ^2 \\gamma^4.\\ ] ] the second term in the left - hand side of ( 9 ) describes the betatron cooling of the particles with decreasing magnetic field @xmath81 @xmath82 is the plasma frequency and @xmath83 is the cyclotron frequency in the jet at the initial time @xmath84 . in our case for @xmath85 the value of @xmath86 , and we can write the solution of equation ( 9 ) as @xmath87 where the time @xmath88 ( @xmath89 is the classic electron radius ) . for not very small times in the frame of the jet , @xmath90 , we have @xmath91 the characteristic frequency @xmath92 , at which relativistic particles radiate synchrotron photons , will change in time @xmath93 for such a dependence @xmath94 the observed frequency @xmath95 and the time in the frame of observer @xmath96 are related as @xmath97 we see that the time of glowing at a given frequency in the observer frame is @xmath98 for the photon energy @xmath99 , which is typical of a grb , the time of glowing is @xmath100 .",
    "this time just corresponds to the maximum of the distribution of long grb over their duration ( at the level 90% from the peak luminosity - @xmath101 ) .",
    "the observations showed that it is long grb ( @xmath102 ) that are sometimes accompanied the afterglow in x - ray and/or optic bands . according to our model",
    "the duration of the x - ray afterglow ( @xmath103 ) is several days , and that of the optic afterglow ( @xmath104 ) is several months .",
    "these estimations do not contradict the observations of grb .    from our model",
    "we obtain also the estimations for the rate of the change of the afterglow intensity , @xmath105 .",
    "the observations show ( see , for example @xcite , @xcite ) the dependence @xmath106 , which does not contradict our estimation .",
    "probably , if the energy of the shock from a sn is not enough to tear off the magnetospheric tail of magnetized component , then there will not be any jet and consequently no afterglow will be observed .",
    "this situation is more typical of a not energetic grb and they will be short ( @xmath107 ) ."
