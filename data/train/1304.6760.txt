    "studies of routes from order to chaos in families of low - dimensional dynamical systems usually started with theoretical and numerical investigations , which were soon followed by detailed experiments .",
    "accurate experimental verification not only recovered the qualitative picture of the transition but was also able to resolve its quantitative characteristics .",
    "universal sequence of period - doubling bifurcations , onset of chaos via the breakup of the quasiperiodic oscillations as well as scaling laws in different kinds of intermittency have been documented in numerous mechanical , hydrodynamical , optical , chemical etc .",
    "experiments ( see references to original publications e.g. in  @xcite ) .",
    "there is , however , a group of scenarios which is well understood theoretically , but has received less attention from experimentalists : these are the routes to chaos via the sequences of so - called _ gluing bifurcations_. along such routes , pairs of stable periodic orbits come close in the phase space , recombine and form new stable periodic orbits which are more complicated than the original ones . each recombination",
    "is mediated by two trajectories , homoclinic to the same saddle point .",
    "homoclinic bifurcations often occur in nonlinear dynamics : in the lorenz equations  @xcite , the birth of the chaotic set in the phase space owes to the so - called `` homoclinic explosion ''  @xcite .",
    "the gluing bifurcation differs from the homoclinic explosion both in the number of newborn periodic orbits and in their stability .",
    "the explosion generates , in a single act of creation , the countable set of periodic orbits , each of them asymptotically unstable ; taken together , they form the kind of `` skeleton '' for the emerging chaotic attractor .",
    "in contrast , a gluing bifurcation , taken alone , produces just one or two stable periodic orbits  @xcite .",
    "however , in the course of the sequence ( `` scenario '' ) of such bifurcations the shape of the attracting orbit gets more and more involved , and its length grows , until the whole development culminates in the chaotic attractor . which of two cases  a homoclinic explosion or a gluing bifurcation  takes place in the particular family of dynamical systems ,",
    "is entirely determined by the ratio of the two leading eigenvalues of the jacobian computed at the saddle point .",
    "from the point of view of an experimentalist , gluing scenarios have an unpleasant feature : vulnerability of their basic building blocks . unlike periodic orbits , saddle connections in generic dynamical systems are structurally unstable .",
    "furthermore , a gluing bifurcation assumes coexistence , at the same set of parameter values , of two homoclinic trajectories to the same saddle point .",
    "since , generically , formation of the homoclinic trajectory to a saddle point of a dissipative system is a codimension - one event , every gluing bifurcation is a codimension - two phenomenon .",
    "hence , the accomplishment of the gluing scenario requires either the perfect mirror ( @xmath1 ) symmetry of the system ( which transforms a homoclinic orbit into another one , so that they exist in pairs ) , or the ability to track in the parameter space the sequences of codimension - two events .",
    "this makes gluing bifurcations a difficult object for laboratory studies : they are sensitive both to fluctuations and to imperfections of the experimental setup .",
    "most occurrences of gluing scenarios in families of dynamical systems were reported in theoretical and numerical studies : in the context of hydrodynamics  @xcite , nematic liquid crystals  @xcite and optothermal devices  @xcite . in the experiments ,",
    "separate gluing bifurcations were identified in the taylor - couette flow of the viscous fluid between two cylinders  @xcite and in the chua oscillators  @xcite . here , we report on our experimental investigation of the sequence of gluing bifurcations in an analog electronic circuit .",
    "in the phase space of a continuous dissipative dynamical system , the basic ingredient of the gluing bifurcation is an equilibrium of the saddle type with one - dimensional unstable manifold .",
    "we start from the situation when the system , like the lorenz equations , possesses a symmetry which transforms into each other two components of this manifold . when the parameters of the system are varied , location of invariant manifolds in the phase space varies as well .",
    "at certain combinations of parameters , one of the components of the unstable manifold can return back to the saddle along the stable manifold and form the homoclinic orbit .",
    "symmetry ensures that the second component returns as well : homoclinic orbits come in pairs .",
    "sequence of events ( scenario ) which accompany the birth / destruction of homoclinic orbits , depends on the leading eigenvalues of linearization of the equations at the saddle point . since unstable",
    "manifold is one - dimensional , there is just one positive eigenvalue , denoted below as @xmath2 . below",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case when the closest to zero negative eigenvalue @xmath3 is real .",
    "the `` saddle index '' @xmath4 indicates which of the two properties  contraction or expansion  dominates the phase space in the neighborhood of the fixed point , and , thereby , governs the stability of the bifurcating solutions . in absence of symmetry , destruction of a single homoclinic trajectory creates a unique periodic orbit which is stable if @xmath5 and unstable otherwise  @xcite .",
    "presence of the second , symmetric homoclinic trajectory enriches dynamics : all trajectories which leave the vicinity of the saddle , are re - injected back . in this case , under @xmath6 the countable set of unstable periodic orbits , as well as a continuum of recurrent trajectories is simultaneously born from the pair of homoclinic orbits  @xcite ; this `` homoclinic explosion '' is a crucial step in the subsequent formation of the lorenz attractor .",
    "the situation for @xmath5 is simpler : here two stable periodic orbits approach the saddle point , and are `` glued together '' forming two homoclinic orbits .",
    "when the pair of homoclinic trajectories breaks up , the new stable symmetric periodic orbit is left in the phase space : it is obtained by concatenation of the previously existing ones .",
    "the length and the number of loops ( turns ) of the attracting trajectory in the phase space is doubled , like in the case of the period - doubling bifurcation .",
    "notably , in contrast to the period doubling bifurcation , the temporal period displays unbounded growth when the system approaches the bifurcation : the period becomes infinite when the homoclinic trajectories are formed .",
    "further variation of parameter can result in the sequence of secondary gluing bifurcations : unstable manifold can return to the saddle after performing several turns in the phase space . before this , a symmetry - breaking bifurcation should take place : the newborn symmetric periodic orbit is destabilized in the course of the pitchfork bifurcation , and two mutually symmetric orbits branch from it .",
    "these two orbits approach the unstable manifold of the saddle and coalesce in the next gluing bifurcation . as a consequence",
    ", the new stable periodic orbit is born , which has four times more loops than the original ones .",
    "the subsequent scenario consists of alternating gluing- and symmetry - breaking bifurcations that eventually end in the formation of the chaotic attractor which has a two - lobe shape , reminiscent of the lorenz attractor .",
    "the sequence of the bifurcational values of the parameter has been shown to converge at the exponential rate  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the period - doubling scenario , this rate is not the unique universal constant : renormalization group analysis shows that the universality class is completely predetermined by the ( in general , non - integer ) value of the saddle index @xmath5 .    remarkably , the attractor which is formed in the course of this bifurcation scenario , occupies a certain intermediate position between order and chaos : the fourier spectrum of the trajectory is neither discrete like in case of regular dynamics , nor absolutely continuous like in case of a chaotic or stochastic process , but",
    "is supported by the fractal set .",
    "accordingly , observables are characterized through long - range non - exponential correlations  @xcite .    if the symmetry between the components of the unstable manifold is violated , each gluing bifurcation is a codimension - two event . on the plane of two parameters ,",
    "there are numerous paths which lead from order to chaos via the formations of secondary homoclinic orbits ; each of these paths is characterized by its own scaling constants .      while choosing a dynamical system which should serve as a candidate for experimental modeling by an electronic circuit , it is reasonable to minimize both the order of the system and the complexity of its linear and nonlinear terms .",
    "a unique gluing bifurcation can take place on the phase plane , but for occurrence of _ sequences _ of such bifurcations the phase space should be at least three - dimensional .",
    "a natural candidate is a system of the lorenz equations  @xcite : they possess the desired symmetry and are capable to exhibit homoclinic bifurcations . in the three - dimensional parameter space of the lorenz equations ,",
    "formation of two symmetric homoclinic orbits has codimension one : it takes place upon the two - dimensional surface . in the phase space",
    ", a homoclinic bifurcation is a nonlocal event . for this reason",
    ", the values of parameters under which the homoclinic orbits in dissipative dynamical systems are formed , typically can not be explicitly obtained in the closed form and should be found numerically .",
    "there are several analytical techniques which allow to exclude presence of homoclinic orbits and/or provide bounds for their existence in the parameter space  @xcite .",
    "we are , however , not aware of rigorous theoretical results which would allow to conclude on the location of the whole bifurcation surface in the parameter space of the lorenz equations .",
    "numerical evidence indicates that the two - dimensional surface of homoclinic bifurcation lies in the part of the parameter space which corresponds to @xmath6 ; hence , the `` canonical '' lorenz equations display no gluing bifurcations . to circumvent this obstacle",
    ", we introduce an additional term and consider the set of equations @xmath7 here , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the conventional lorenz parameters , whereas @xmath11 parameterizes the added nonlinear term in the first equation . at",
    "@xmath11=0 eqs ( [ lz ] ) turn into the lorenz equations .",
    "the system ( [ lz ] ) is reminiscent of the model , employed in @xcite for studies of thermal convection in the layer of fluid subjected to high - frequency modulation of gravity .",
    "we fix the traditional values of the parameters @xmath8=10 and @xmath10=8/3  @xcite , and vary the remaining parameters @xmath9 and @xmath11 .    among the properties of equations ( [ lz ] ) we list only those which are relevant for gluing bifurcations and for experimental modeling .",
    "equations ( [ lz ] ) are invariant with respect to the transformation @xmath12 . the origin @xmath13 is the equilibrium which is stable for @xmath14 and is a saddle with one - dimensional unstable manifold in the parameter range @xmath15 . at @xmath16 the pitchfork bifurcation takes place at the origin ; this bifurcation is supercritical for @xmath17 and subcritical otherwise . ] . like in the original lorenz equations , variation of parameters",
    "can produce pairs of structurally unstable homoclinic orbits to the saddle point ; these orbits leave the vicinity of the origin along the @xmath18-plane and return to it along the @xmath19-axis ; under @xmath20 this happens at @xmath21 .",
    "the saddle index of the origin equals @xmath22 since the value of @xmath23 is @xmath11-independent , variation of @xmath11 allows to study the effects of additional nonlinearity under constant saddle index .",
    "the value of @xmath23 is smaller than 1 for @xmath24 and exceeds 1 otherwise .",
    "numerical integration ( we have used the recurrent taylor algorithm of the 30th order with variable time - step ) indicates that increase of @xmath11 lowers the critical value @xmath25 , required for the formation of the pair of homoclinic orbits .",
    "therefore , at small positive values of @xmath11 breakup of homoclinic orbits is followed by the homoclinic explosion and the lorenz scenario of transition to chaos , whereas the sufficiently large values of @xmath11 ensure the inequality @xmath5 , so that the sequence of gluing bifurcations is observed .",
    "for our measurements we took the electronic circuit with the help of which the authors of  @xcite reproduced the dynamics on the lorenz attractor . in order to take account of the additional nonlinear term in the first equation of  ( [ lz ] ) , we introduced an additional analog multiplier ( the rightmost multiplier in fig .  [ fig_1 ] ) .    ) .",
    "nominal values of resistors and capacitors are shown on the scheme .",
    "the analog multipliers ( denoted by crosses ) are of the type ad633an .",
    "variables @xmath26 are output voltage values of operational amplifiers u1b , u2b and u3b , respectively . ]    the cited values of electrical characteristics correspond to fixed values @xmath27 and @xmath28 in eqs ( [ lz ] )",
    ". changing of parameters @xmath11 and @xmath9 is enabled by variation of respective resistances r17 and r5 .",
    "the value of @xmath11 equals 10 divided by the value of r17 in @xmath29 ; the value of @xmath9 equals 0.01 of the resistance r5 in @xmath29 .    to ensure that all voltages in the circuit stay inside the operating range of dynamical multipliers ( from 10 to 10 v ) , the original dependent and independent variables need to be rescaled : we assume that the dimensionless potential differences @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath19 are measured in volts , and proceed to @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 . for the time measured in `` seconds '' , we introduce @xmath35 with @xmath36=100 .",
    "this recasts eqs ( [ lz ] ) into @xmath37 where prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath38 .",
    "finally , it should be noted that , due to inevitable presence of nonlinearities in the multipliers , the real circuit , in fact , does not reproduce the perfect symmetry of eq.([rescaled ] ) with respect to the simultaneous change of sign of voltages @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    in order to initiate the trajectories close to the unstable manifold of the saddle point ,",
    "the circuit was grounded for a short time .",
    "the subsequent growth of voltage began from rather small values .",
    "voltages were measured and recorded at a rate of 5000 records per second .",
    "we did not apply any kind of filtering ; stability of the scheme and smallness of time - step allowed us to plot quite smooth phase portraits of the system directly from the experimental data .",
    "we measured and recorded time - dependent voltages in the circuit for various values of the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath9 at fixed @xmath8=10 and @xmath10=8/3 .",
    "the equilibrium @xmath39=@xmath40=@xmath41=0 is stable for @xmath421 and is a saddle - point in the range @xmath431 .",
    "measurements on the circuit and numerical integration of eqs ( [ lz ] ) confirm existence of the curve @xmath44 upon which principal homoclinic orbits to this saddle are formed .",
    "both in the experiment and in numerical studies this event is marked by change in the asymptotics of large @xmath45 for trajectories with initial conditions near the origin .",
    "prior to the bifurcation , the trajectory which starts with small positive values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 tends to the attractor ( equilibrium or oscillatory state ) which is contained in the half - space @xmath46 . after the bifurcation",
    ", this trajectory makes a loop in the half - space @xmath46 , crosses into the opposite half - space @xmath47 and settles on the attractor there .    under low values of @xmath11 ,",
    "formation of homoclinic orbit occurs at @xmath6 ; this corresponds to the lorenz scenario of transition to chaos . immediately beyond this curve the chaotic set , created by the homoclinic explosion at @xmath44 , is unstable ;",
    "its presence is reflected in the existence of chaotic transients which precede relaxation to stable equilibria ( `` metastable chaos ''  @xcite ) .",
    "on the parameter plane , the domain corresponding to this kind of dynamics is bounded from above by the curve @xmath48 which marks stabilization of the chaotic set and emergence of the chaotic attractor . upon this curve",
    "the unstable manifold of the saddle point hits the stable manifold of the unstable periodic orbit  @xcite .",
    "numerically , we detected the latter curve by tracking the separatrices of the saddle point ; in the experiments @xmath48 was identified as the lowest value of @xmath9 ( or the leftmost value of @xmath11 ) where the circuit possessed non - decaying chaotic dynamics . for values of @xmath9 beyond @xmath48",

    "indeed , we observed in the experiment the lorenz - like chaotic attractors for @xmath53 and gluing bifurcations for @xmath54 .",

    "close to the homoclinic bifurcation , the measured values of the period @xmath57 of the oscillations match the known logarithmic asymptotics : @xmath58 .    as seen in fig.[fig_4 ] , the oscillations are strongly anharmonic : the overwhelming part of the period is spent in nearly motionless state .",
