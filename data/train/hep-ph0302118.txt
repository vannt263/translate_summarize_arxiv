    "to date , 3 different kinds of experiments are being used or can be conceived to get informations on the physical parameters in the mass matrix of 3 majorana neutrinos : i ) oscillation experiments , which can make access to the 2 independent squared mass differences @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , to the 3 mixing angles @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and to a cp violating phase @xmath7 ; ii ) @xmath8 and @xmath9 decay experiments , probing 2 appropriate combinations of masses and oscillation parameters , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ; iii ) cosmological and/or astrophysical experiments , which might detect , e.g. , the sum of the neutrino masses @xmath12 . an increasing level of difficulty is involved in the different experiments , however , to reach the needed sensitivity , crucially depending on the actual neutrino mass spectrum . for a hierarchical spectrum , either `` normal '' ( @xmath13 ) or `` inverted '' ( @xmath14 ) , as we shall consider in the following , one can tentatively assume , at least for illustration purposes , that all the six oscillation observables will be measured , some of them with significant precision , perhaps together with the @xmath9 mass @xmath11 .",
    "this makes a total of seven observables , which a theory of neutrino masses should be able to correlate among each other .",
    "a simple minded conjecture is that some of these correlations could arise from the economy in the number of independent basic parameters . as the simplest example",
    ", one may consider the possibility that the neutrino mass matrix @xmath15 , in the flavour basis , has a maximum number of negligibly small entries  @xcite .",
    "inspection shows that , out of the 6 independent elements of the @xmath16 symmetric matrix @xmath15 , only 2 of them could at most vanish consistently with current observations  @xcite @xmath17 this leaves a total of 15 different mass matrices to be examined , all of which dependent on 4 real parameters and 1 phase that can affect the 6 oscillation observables and @xmath11 .",
    "one expects therefore 2 relations between these observables , a priori different in every case .",
    "although interesting , the limit of this approach is that the elements of the neutrino mass matrix in the flavor basis are , in general , only combinations of the basic parameters in the relevant piece of the lagrangian , @xmath18 . for sure @xmath15",
    "is generally influenced also by the charged lepton mass matrix or , if the seesaw mechanism is operative , by the mass matrix of the right handed neutrinos .",
    "a natural question to ask therefore is what happens if the economy in the number of parameters is not in @xmath15 but rather in the basic lagrangian .",
    "this is the question we address in this paper .    to answer",
    "this question in full generality would require examining a huge number of different possibilities , of which the 15 cases for @xmath15 mentioned above are only a small subset . in the following we shall only consider the possibilities that describe the currently observed pattern of the data  ( [ eq : obs ] ) in a `` natural '' way , i.e.  only by the relative smallness ( vanishing ) of some parameters in @xmath18 , barring special relations or accidental cancellations among them .",
    "this should in particular be the case when accounting simultaneously for the smallness of @xmath19 and for the largeness of @xmath0 , the most peculiar feature of the data so far , even though an accidental cancellation might also produce the same feature .",
    "as illustrated below , it turns out that none of the 15 cases for @xmath15 mentioned above satisfy this criterion in a strict sense .",
    "note that naturality is not defined here in terms of any symmetry .",
    "in particular we do not require that the relative smallness ( vanishing ) of some parameters in the basic lagrangian be understood in terms of an explicit symmetry , exact or approximate .",
    "the coming into play of symmetries could add new cases to our list .",
    "viceversa , it could prove hard to understand some of the cases we consider as due to a flavour symmetry of any sort .",
    "as anticipated , we shall independently consider : + i ) the direct non see - saw case ( nssc ) for the 3 majorana neutrinos @xmath20 , described by the mass lagrangian ( after electroweak symmetry breaking ) @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 ; + ii ) the see - saw case ( ssc ) with the lagrangian mediated by 2 or 3 right handed neutrinos , collectively denoted by @xmath24 @xmath25    the neutrino mass matrix in the flavour basis , @xmath15 , and the leptonic analog of the cabibbo kobayashi maskawa matrix @xmath26 are given respectively by @xmath27 in terms of the diagonal matrices @xmath28 where , in the ssc , @xmath29 .",
    "to count easily the number of effective parameters in @xmath30 , in the ssc it is convenient to define @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 with @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) for 2 ( 3 ) right handed neutrinos .",
    "note that this decomposition is unique , with all @xmath36 s positive .",
    "it is then @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is adimensional , while @xmath39 has the dimension of an inverse mass ) .",
    "of course the naturalness requirement applies equivalently to @xmath40 , @xmath41 or to @xmath39 , @xmath38 .",
    "the number of effective parameters in @xmath30 is the sum of the parameters in @xmath39 and @xmath38 .    within this framework ,",

    "more precisely , to realize ii ) we stick to the cases that give a neutrino mass matrix in the flavor basis involving at most 4 real parameters and one phase .",

    "this is obtained partly by general considerations and partly by direct inspection of the individual cases .      as an illustration , before describing the positive cases , let us show why the nssc with diagonal @xmath64 does not lead to any acceptable example , according to our rules .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix in the flavour basis , @xmath15 , coincides with @xmath65 in eq .",

    "this justifies considering the matrices @xmath15 with 2 vanishing entries also in a natural sense .",

    "on the other hand , they introduce new parameters . therefore , the only way in which they can give rise to a new realistic and predictive case is when they act in association with a @xmath65 that depends at most on 3 effective parameters and is close enough to the fully realistic situation . on this basis , one is readily convinced that an interesting case is represented by any @xmath65 , frequently encountered , which gives an inverted spectrum and @xmath120 .",
    "the role of the charged lepton contribution @xmath100 or @xmath101 is essential in providing the required correction to @xmath121 in a natural way .    in this way one",
