    "since experiments with two - dimensional electron gas in a semiconductor @xcite it is demonstrated that electric conduction is quantized , and elementary conductance quantum is equal to @xmath0 . when measured on tiny contacts of nonmagnetic semiconductors and metals",
    "the conductance quantization is limited to low temperatures by thermal fluctuations , and the factor 2 is attributed to the two - fold spin degeneracy of conduction electron states . recently",
    ", sharp conductance quantization steps have been observed in nanosize point contacts of ferromagnetic metals at room temperature @xcite .",
    "it was possible , because phonon and magnon assisted relaxation processes are quenched due to a large , @xmath1 , exchange splitting of the conduction band .",
    "in addition , oshima and miyano @xcite found an indication of the odd - valued number @xmath2 of open conductance channels ( @xmath3 ) in nickel point contacts from room temperature up to 770k .",
    "@xcite presented an evidence of switching from @xmath0 conductance quantum to @xmath4 quantum at room temperature in the nickel nanocontacts of another morphology .",
    "obviously , the change of conductance quantum from @xmath0 to @xmath4 is a result of lifting - off the spin degeneracy of the conduction band .",
    "recent calculations @xcite confirmed the @xmath4 conductance quantization in ferromagnetic metals , which is due to non - synchronous opening of  up  and  down  spin - channels in the point contact conduction .",
    "new pulse to studies of electric transport in ferromagnets has been given by observation of giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) in nanosize magnetic contacts by garca _",
    "magnetoresistance magnitudes of 280% for ni - ni @xcite and 200% for co - co @xcite nanosize contacts were obtained at room temperature .",
    "somewhat smaller ( @xmath5 ) , but also very large for a single interface , magnetoresistance was observed in fe - fe point contacts @xcite . in these experiments there",
    "is a huge spread in the measured values of magnetoresistance , drawn as a function of conductance at ferromagnetic alignment of magnetizations in contacting ferromagnetic domains ( f - conductance ) .",
    "the spread of mr points for ni - ni and co - co contacts is extremely large at f - conductance lying in the range of 2 - 8 elementary conductances @xmath4 .",
    "the above mentioned observations of conductance quantization steps in point junctions of ferromagnetic metals at room temperature give anticipation that conduction quantization is responsible for the giant magnitude and the giant fluctuations of magnetoresistance in tiny magnetic contacts .    in this article",
    "we develop a simple model of conductance and magnetoresistance for nanosize magnetic contacts in the regime of conductance quantization ( quantum magnetic contacts ) , proposed in the previous work @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we argued , that if only one conduction electron spin - channel is open at f - conductance , then the magnitude of gmr is limited only by spin - flip processes of conduction electrons when passing through the point contact @xcite .",
    "then the magnetic nanocontact serves as quantum spin - valve . when both spin - channels of f - conduction are open we established , that gmr is a multivalued function of conductance at ferromagnetic alignment of magnetizations ( at least at low temperatures and absence of disorder ) .",
    "this means that if the conductance is quantized , different samples , having the same f - conductance , reveal different magnetoresistance .",
    "distribution of magnetoresistance values is not normal or flat in the statistical sense .",
    "rather , at fixed f - conductance values , smaller magnitudes are much more probable than the maximal ones .",
    "the width of distribution is extremely large for the first few open f - conductance channels .",
    "thus , we concluded that the giant raw - data fluctuations observed in the experiments by garca _",
    "_ @xcite might be the consequence of conduction quantization . in the present study we focus out attention on the influence of the point contact cross - section asymmetry on gmr .",
    "we find that number of open conduction channels , at which conductance shows up for the antiferromagnetically aligned magnetizations , depends not only on the conduction band spin - polarization @xcite , but also on the aspect ratio of the contact cross - section .",
    "we discuss the above mentioned as well as very recent experiments on gmr in magnetic nanocontacts .",
    "we consider a model of two ferromagnetic , single - domain half - spaces contacting via a narrow and short neck with typical length from one to several nanometers . for the f - alignment of domains",
    "the magnetization is homogeneous along the constriction , therefore current carriers move in a constant potential created by the magnetization . at antiferromagnetically ( af )",
    "aligned domains a domain wall ( dw ) is created inside the neck .",
    "then , the carriers move in a potential landscape created by the domain wall . according to the general quantum - mechanical prescription , any inhomogeneity in the potential energy landscape results in a reflection of quasiparticle wave function , which evokes an additional electric resistance @xcite . for the free dw between unconstrained domains",
    "this domain - wall resistance is very small because the profile of dw is smooth , and free domain wall width @xmath6 is large , typically in the range 15 - 150 nm for the strong elemental ferromagnets like co , fe and ni @xcite . however ,",
    "if dw is created in the constriction , then the wall width @xmath7 is approximately equal to the length of the neck @xmath8 , which is at least an order of magnitude shorter than @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the sharpening of dw leads to huge enhancement of quasiparticle reflection from dw @xcite , as well as some increase of impurity scattering @xcite .",
    "when the external dc magnetic field aligns the domains magnetizations parallel ( f - alignment ) , it eliminates dw and domain - wall reflection , which results in essential decrease of resistance , _",
    "i.e. _ leads to gmr @xcite .",
    "now we consider the regime of quantized conductance through the nanosize neck .",
    "the cross - section size of the neck is assumed very small , typically about 1 nm , so that the transverse motion of electron in the neck is quantized . in our previous work @xcite we considered the neck of cylindrical cross - section , in this paper we give solution for the neck of rectangular shape .",
    "the length of the neck , @xmath8 , is considered shorter than the electron mean free path , that is why the electron transport through the neck is ballistic . actually , the neck is a conducting bridge which plays the role of a quantum filter .",
    "it selects from the continuous domain of quasiparticle incidence angles only those , which meet the allowed ( and quantized ) transverse momentum in the channel , and satisfy the energy and momentum conservation laws . for the particular calculations of conductance we may use the ballistic - limit versions of the formulas ( 14 ) , ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) of our work @xcite",

    "@xmath18 is the quantum - mechanical transmission coefficient for the connecting channel ( see below ) .",
    "the magnetoresistance is defined as follows : @xmath19    quantization of transverse motion in the channel obliges the parallel to the interface projection of the incident quasiparticle momentum to satisfy the requirement : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the fermi momentum for the @xmath13-th spin - channel , @xmath22 is the quantized wave number ( see definition below ) .",
    "this is the first basic selection rule , which comes from quantization .",
    "tilde in ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) means that the summations should be done over the open conduction channels satisfying the condition : @xmath23 when the magnetizations alignment is ferromagnetic , the fermi momenta on both sides of the contact are equal in each , spin - up and spin - down , channel , respectively .",
    "the energy and momentum conservations are satisfied , and the transmission coefficients are equal to unity . at the antiferromagnetic alignment the conservation of the parallel to the interface momentum ( @xmath24 , where the subscript 1 or 2 labels left- or right - hand side of the contact , respectively ) introduces the additional selection rule into eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) : @xmath25 this selection rule is strictly valid , if the electron spin conserves upon transmission through the dw .",

    "it allows us to make the following conclusions : 1 ) the f - alignment conductance is spin - dependent , the conductions of spin - channels open asynchronously ( panel ( a ) ) , thus resulting in @xmath4 quantization of conductance @xcite ; 2 ) if some number of conduction channels are open for the f - alignment ( @xmath53 is finite ) , but there is no conduction for the af - alignment ( @xmath54 ) , then , according to definition eq .",

    "it is the quantum spin - valve regime ; 3 ) the magnitude of mr beyond the quantum spin - valve regime is well above 200% for very moderate polarization of the conduction band ( @xmath50 , see discussion below ) ; 4 ) the magnetoresistance has very sharp and high peak , when the first channel for af conductance step appears ( panel ( b ) in correlation with panel(a ) ) ; 5 ) sudden jumps in magnetoresistance , followed by practically flat plateaus , appear at the moments when new f - alignment spin - up conductance channel opens .",
    "they persist until the spin - down projection opens new channel ( panel ( b ) in correlation with panel ( a ) ) ; 6 ) panels ( c ) and ( d ) show that the magnetoresistance drawn as a function of quantized f - alignment conductance is a multivalued function of f - conductance , @xmath53 @xcite .",

    "non - disperse behavior of mr comes if the af - conductance is practically independent on the contact size when a new f - conductance channel opens ( see panel ( a ) ) .",
    "the issue 6 ) means , that if the temperature and disorder effects can be neglected , several values of magnetoresistance correspond to the same number of open conductance channels for the f - alignment of magnetizations ( abscissa in the panels ( c ) and ( d ) ) . the overall width of distributions of mr points , which belong to the same value of the quantized f - conductance , may be comparable with maximal value of mr , _ i.e. _ magnetoresistance acquires giant fluctuations because of conductance quantization .    next , we change the aspect ratio @xmath56 of the sides of the rectangular cross - section , @xmath57 fig .",
    "2 is drawn with @xmath58 .",
    "main changes compared to fig .",
    "1 can be summarized as follows : 1 ) the af - conductance opens now at three open channels of f - conductance ( @xmath59 , panels ( c ) and ( d ) ) ; 2 ) the range of the neck sizes with zero af - conductance ( quantum spin - valve ) becomes broader ; 3 ) the overall magnitudes of mr increase ( panels ( b)-(d ) ) ; 4 ) magnetoresistance points appear at almost every number of open f - conductance channels ( compare panels ( c ) and ( d ) of figs . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "we emphasize the issue which has important implication to point contact gmr experiments : number of open f - conductance channels , at which the af conductance opens ( @xmath60 in fig.1 and @xmath59 in fig.2 ) depends not only on the polarization of the conduction band @xcite , but also on the asymmetry of the point contact cross - section .",
    "there are techniques , which provide the information about the spin - polarization of the ferromagnet s conduction band at the fermi energy .",
    "these are the ferromagnet - insulator - superconductor tunneling spectroscopy ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) and the andreev - reflection spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the tunneling spectroscopy suggests the following estimates for the mean values of conduction band polarization parameter @xmath44 : 0.6 for permalloy ( ni@xmath61fe@xmath62 ) ; 0.63 for pure ni ; 0.48 for co and 0.43 for fe . from the andreev - reflection spectroscopy",

    "when the cross - section of the point contact is very small , so that f - conduction is open for only one spin - channel , the magnitude of gmr is limited from above by the spin - reversal rate of conduction electrons upon passing through the neck @xcite .",
