    "this search for an unbinned goodness - of - fit test has been motivated by the widespread use of unbinned maximum likelihood fitting for determining @xmath1-violating parameters at belle . while there are many cross - checks to insure that there are no spurious signals and biases , the fits tend to be complicated and not very transparent .",
    "they often involve probability density functions ( pdf s ) that differ with every event , based on measured quantities that add dimensions to the data that are not explicit in the fits .",
    "as there is no widely accepted unbinned goodness - of - fit test that applies to such fits , testing for statistical consistency of results has been uneven .",
    "the tests that have been done , resorting to binned @xmath0 or toy monte carlo , have their place but have not been entirely satisfactory in addressing the question .",
    "a common technique of unbinned tests involves first transforming the measured quantities to a variable in which the null hypothesis has a uniform distribution , where the pdf is flat , and then to test this `` flattened '' distribution for consistency with uniformity .",
    "there exists a variety of tests for uniformity , but most are not readily extended to multidimensional data , and they do not address compound hypotheses .",
    "a review of methods is given in @xcite .",
    "in this report , we explore a test statistic that is based on the two - dimensional random walk . to begin , its distribution in the case of a flat pdf is discussed .",
    "the ensemble distribution is then found for several alternate hypotheses , and the rejection power is calculated for comparison with other goodness - of - fit tests . as the aim of a goodness - of - fit test as it would be applied at belle is to test the validity of the parametrization used in fitting , it is also important to examine how the test is modified under compound hypotheses . the discussion is thus expanded to include data which are fitted to determine one or more parameters . finally , we discuss the possibility of extending to multidimensional data .",
    "a dataset consisting of @xmath2 measurements of the one - dimensional quantity @xmath3 lying in the interval @xmath4 $ ] may be mapped trivially to points on a unit circle with polar angle @xmath5 on the interval @xmath6 $ ] , so that each point is considered to be a unit vector with direction defined by @xmath5 .",
    "if the pdf in @xmath3 is flat , the vector sum of the corresponding unit vectors in two dimensions corresponds to the net displacement , @xmath7 , after a two - dimensional random walk of @xmath2 steps with unit step size . for sufficiently large @xmath2 , this distribution converges to a well - known form ( rayleigh , 1888 ) and the distribution in @xmath8 is an exponential decay with mean equal to @xmath2 .",
    "we take @xmath9 as the test statistic .",
    "a deviation of the root distribution from the hypothesis will result in a bias of the ensemble distribution of this test statistic away from the origin .",
    "this statistic is mathematically equivalent to the first order term in the fourier series that describes the distribution of the data : @xmath10 where one can see that @xmath11 .",
    "one would expect this distribution to be most sensitive to an overall imbalance of the pdf in generally opposite @xmath5 directions . to obtain sensitivity to higher order differences",
    ", one could thus take successively higher order terms in the series , for @xmath12 . in practice",
    "it may not be useful to examine terms above @xmath13 . in this study",
    "we look at @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) and define @xmath16 . what we have defined as @xmath17 appears in the review of dagostino and stephens@xcite as @xmath18 in the context of the von mises test , a test for uniformity on a circle .",
    "as mentioned above , the @xmath19 distribution for a flat pdf converges rapidly to an exponential with a decay constant of unity .",
    "figure  [ fig : null ] ( top row ) shows the distributions in @xmath19 for ensembles of randomly generated experiments containing @xmath20 , 100 , and 1000 events .",
    "each of the three distributions is fitted via binned maximum likelihood to an exponential form .",
    "the fitted inverse decay constants ( `` slopes '' ) are @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , respectively , in excellent agreement with the expectation .     for flat pdf : experiments with @xmath20 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , shown with fits to an exponential form .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=510 ]    to evaluate rejection power , these distributions may be compared with those obtained for pdf s that are not flat .",
    "the alternative hypotheses used in a study by aslan and zech  @xcite provide a convenient range of function types and allow for a direct comparson with the range of tests reviewed in their work .",
    "in that paper the rejection power of the alternative hypothesis was defined as one minus the probability for an error of the second kind , given a criterion that yields a 5% significance for the null hypothesis . since in this case",
    "the null hypothesis gives an exponential distribution with unit decay constant , the 5% criterion is @xmath27",

    "our goal in this investigation has been to arrive at a multidimensional unbinned goodness - of - fit test , one that has rejection power in all dimensions , not just in one - dimensional projections , for multidimensional data .",
    "many unbinned tests depend on the integrated sum of or spacings between neighboring data points , quantities which are not well - defined when extended to more than one dimension .",
    "although the @xmath17 statistic does not have this property , it is yet to be determined whether there exists an extension that is fully multidimensional ; for example , in two dimensions , two components each mapped to a circle corresponds to a data space that is the surface of a toroid , for which there is no obvious nontrivial vector sum that maps to the random walk .",
    "a fully general extension to multidimensional data will additionally require a flattening algorithm and provisions for data spaces of arbitrary shape .",
    "we will continue to explore the possibilities for extending @xmath17 for use with multidimensional data .",
    "we have explored an unbinned goodness - of - fit test for data in one dimension that is based on the mapping of flattened distributions to a two - dimensional random walk .",
    "this method is truly binning - free and scale - independent , and the ensemble distribution for the null hypothesis is well - defined . for a compound hypothesis",
    "we specify a procedure to determine the ensemble distribution of the test statistic via monte carlo so that rejection power may be readily determined . the distribution is found for several different parametrized forms and shown to be largely independent of statistics .",
    "we examine several samples for dependence between the test statistic and fitted parameter values , and find no evidence of any .",
    "the rejection power for alternate hypotheses is demonstrated for a few examples and is found to be comparable to that of the chisquare method .",
