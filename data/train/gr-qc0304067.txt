    "if dark radiation can be produced by high - energy interactions , then its presence serves to suppress @xmath94 on large - scales , as in fig .",
    "we have investigated the effects of dark radiation in the background on large - scale density perturbations ( neglecting gradient terms ) in a randall - sundrum  2 type brane - world .",
    "dark radiation significantly complicates the perturbation equations .",
    "since it is limited to be a small fraction of the radiation energy density , its effects can be qualitatively analysed via a perturbative approach .",
    "this approach , confirmed by our numerical simulations , shows that in the radiation era , the large - scale density perturbations are suppressed at late times by a small amount . at the same time , the large - scale perturbations in the dark radiation itself grow at late times .",
    "by contrast these perturbations have constant amplitude in a universe with no dark radiation in the background .",
    "the suppression of density perturbations becomes strong when the matter has a stiff ( kinetic - dominated ) equation of state .",
