    "m - type dwarf stars display a high degree of magnetic activity .",
    "both indirect tracers as x - ray and @xmath0 emission , as well as zeeman broadening of magnetically sensitive photospheric lines has been observed ( johns - krull &  valenti 1996 , kochukhov et al .",
    "the photospheric lines show no rotational modulation or net polarization , indicating that fields of small scale relative to the stellar radius exist on the surfaces of m - dwarfs .",
    "these fields can have strengths of a few kg and can cover a substantial area with filling factors up to 50% .    on the theoretical side of things , it has long been considered a problem that m - dwarfs are fully convective , lending no helping hand to the storage of magnetic flux through the presence of a stable stratified convective undershoot layer ( e.g.  van ballegooijen @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , as we show below ( see also dorch & ludwig @xcite ) , it seems that their upper atmospheres are not capable of providing a small - scale network magnetic field , similar to that in the sun , sometimes assumed to be stemming from local small - scale dynamo action in the photosphere ( cattaneo @xcite ) .",
    "however , recent global scale simulations of m - dwarfs seem to render the storage problem obsolete ( dobler @xcite ) , and in this contribution we propose future possibilities regarding numerical simulations of m - dwarf magnetic activity .",
    "first , however , we discuss results from models of m - dwarf local dynamo action .",
    "in order to study local small - scale dynamo action in the photosphere of m - dwarfs we adopted a velocity field from a radiation - hydrodynamics simulation of a prototypical m - dwarf atmosphere from ludwig et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] : here @xmath1 k , @xmath2 and the chemical composition is solar .",
    "magnetic fields can potentially influence the flow structure significantly provided the field is strong .",
    "however , this corresponds to the full mhd case which is beyond the scope of this contribution .",
    "we selected a sequence which comprises roughly 10 convective turn - over time scales .",
    "the sequence consists of 150 snapshots of the flow field , each comprising grid points corresponding to . at any instant in time",
    "about 10 granular cells were present in the computational domain , ensuring a statistically representative ensemble .    to compute the evolution of the magnetic field in responds to the adopted velocity field , we assume the kinematic regime of mhd , where one can neglect the back - reaction of the magnetic field on the fluid motions . then solving the mhd equations reduces to the problem of seeking the solution to the time - dependent induction equation : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the prescribed velocity field , @xmath5 the magnetic field , and @xmath6 the magnetic diffusivity that . we assume a spatially constant magnetic diffusivity that we vary by setting the magnetic reynolds number rm defined as @xmath7 ( where u is a characteristic velocity , @xmath8 a characteristic length scale , and @xmath6 the magnetic diffusivity ) .",
    "we solve eq .",
    "( [ induction.eq ] ) using staggered variables on the grid of the hydrodynamical flow field .",
    "the numerical method was originally developed by galsgaard and others ( galsgaard & nordlund @xcite ) for general mhd purposes , but a special version is the code used by archontis , dorch , & nordlund ( @xcite ) for studying dynamo action in prescribed flows .",
    "the kinematic approximation to the mhd equations becomes inaccurate when the magnetic field becomes sufficiently strong , limiting us to weak fields .    in the following we discuss kinematic mhd models with rm as low as 20 . in the astrophysical context ,",
    "low values of rm are uncommon , mostly due to the large spatial scales usually involved . however , in m - dwarf atmospheres we can be confronted with the situation of rather low rm ( meyer &  meyer - hofmeister 1999 ) : fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows rm in the m - dwarf model ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) as well as the sun ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) .",
    "rm primarily reflects the run of the electric conductivity in the atmosphere , which in turn is mostly controlled by the electron to gas pressure .",
    "the conductivity has been evaluated assuming a weakly ionized plasma .    at sufficiently cool temperatures",
    "rm reaches order unity in the surface layers .",
    "this is a consequence of the declining electron density , the shrinking of spatial scales , and smaller convective velocities : this refers to the surface layers , but qualitatively we expect a strong increase of rm with depth , and beyond a certain depth the regime of @xmath13 is reached again . however , gas motions in this depth will generally be slower and the tangling of magnetic field lines less rapid , which may reduce the efficiency of chromospheric and coronal heating . whether this plays a rle for the observed decline of stellar activity at the transition from m- to l - dwarfs ( gizis et al . 2000 )",
    "is presently a matter of debate ( mohanty et al .",
    "2002 , berger 2002 ) .",
    "a flow is a fast kinematic dynamo when the exponential growth rate @xmath14 is positive .",
    "that is , fast dynamo action requires a continuous increase of magnetic energy , even in the limit of vanishing diffusivity .",
    "this limit is relevant because most astrophysical systems have @xmath15 and small but non - zero @xmath6 .",
    "it is believed that turbulent astrophysical systems are fast dynamos operating at @xmath15 .",
    "when rm increases , the length scale of magnetic islands decreases and scales as @xmath16 .",
    "there is a maximum value of rm , which can be achieved with our numerical resolution @xmath17 km , and therefore the largest magnetic reynolds number that we can allow is of the order of 400 corresponding to the nyquist wavelength @xmath18 . in the following ,",
    "we concentrate on situations with @xmath19 .    in the absence of non - linear effects , in case of a dynamo , one expects a continuing exponential growth of magnetic energy @xmath20 .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the result in terms of @xmath21 for five different models corresponding to varying rm :    most of the models in fact are dominated by decaying modes , with negative growth rates . in particular",
    ", the case with rm = 20 is clearly an example of an anti - dynamo : the diffusion works faster than the flows can sweep up the field and concentrate it in the inter - granular down - draft lanes , and the dominant magnetic mode is a decaying one . increasing rm decreases @xmath14 , so that for rm = 200 the decay time is 40 time longer than at rm = 20 . in terms of providing dynamo action , the most promising cases are those with lower diffusion and rm @xmath22 300400 : at rm = 400 a growing mode seems to be dominating .    in the high diffusion case",
    "the magnetic field varies smoothly across the domain , and its power peaks on scales approximately @xmath23 when considering @xmath24 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . at higher",
    "rm more small scales are generated mostly around the down - draft lanes .",
    "little is known about the structure of magnetic fields in the photospheres of m - dwarfs . from an observational point of view",
    "one would like to get some input from theory that would alleviate the problem of disentangling field strength and filling factor . to this end we started to investigate the kinematic effect of the convective velocity field on a magnetic seed field .",
    "this has become possible due to recent progress in the hydrodynamical modelling of atmospheres in the regime of cool m - dwarfs ( ludwig , allard , &  hauschildt 2002 ) .",
    "we performed kinematic studies of the evolution of small - scale magnetic fields in the surface layers of m - dwarfs .",
    "we solved the induction equation for a prescribed velocity field , magnetic reynolds number rm , and boundary conditions in a cartesian box , representing a volume comprising the optically thin stellar atmosphere and the uppermost part of the optically thick convective envelope .",
    "we find dynamo action for @xmath25 and growth time scales of the magnetic field are comparable to the convective turn - over time scale ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the convective velocity field concentrates the magnetic field in sheets and tubular structures in the inter - granular down - flows .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , rm is of order unity in the surface layers of cooler m - dwarfs , rendering the dynamo inoperative . in",
    "all studied cases we find a rather low spatial filling factor of the magnetic field .    * the geometry of small - scale magnetic fields looks similar to the situation for the sun .",
    "the basic reason is that m - dwarf granulation is qualitatively similar to solar granulation .",
    "* there are differences due to potentially quite different magnetic diffusivities .",
    "* depending on rm , we get or do not get local dynamo action .",
    "future work along the lines of understanding m - dwarf magnetism will involve a more complicated treatment than that discussed above : it is our goal to combine both numerical theoretical modelling and detailed observations to begin to understand how m - dwarfs dynamos operate .",
    "we will use numerical models , such as the detailed radiative hydrodynamic models used here , together with detailed coronal models similar to those that have recently been successfully applied to the sun ( gudiksen & nordlund 2001 ) . by constructing a model that connects the surface and subsurface magnetic field to the corona",
    ", it is our hope that the energetic events observed in the coronae of m - dwarfs will provide a link to understanding the dynamo .",
    "this goal will be achieved by employing a sequence from a radiative hydrodynamic model as a lower velocity boundary condition for a coronal model , yielding an output that can be compared directly to observations .",
    "the unknown magnetic surface topology enters as a  free parameter \" as an initial lower boundary condition that is driven to reconnect by the braiding surface motions .",
