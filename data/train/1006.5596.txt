    "the reducible configurations @xmath47 and @xmath53 are just two in a family of many reducible configurations of those types . modifying the definition of a reduced graph to include the removal of every reducible @xmath46 and every reducible @xmath48-wheel leads us to the following question .",
    "is it the case that every reduced planar triangulation with a set @xmath10 of precolored vertices with @xmath520 contains a @xmath66-steiner tree ?",
    "if the above question has a positive answer , then by theorem [ steiner ] , the precoloring of @xmath10 extends to a @xmath0-list coloring of @xmath1 .",
    "we did not strive to improve the constants here . with more careful calculations ,",
    "one could easily obtain smaller constants .",
    "the condition of no separating short cycles seems to be essential .",
    "reducing the sizes of the lists , increasing the sizes of lists on so - called `` precolored '' vertices , or eliminating the distance condition in this problem is not possible even for a small number of precolored vertices , see figure [ fig : distsize ] .",
    "figure [ fig : tentacles ] shows we can not reduce the sizes of the lists , even if the vertices are on the same face .",
    "this graph belongs to a family of graphs where the length of each path along the unbounded face from the outer triangles to the inner triangle must be divisible by three .",
    "it is not hard to see that if the vertices of the inner triangle are assigned colors @xmath521 , respectively , then one of the vertices with lists of size @xmath185 can not be colored .",
    "however , we conjecture that a precoloring of two far - apart vertices is always extendable to a @xmath0-list coloring of a planar graph .",
    "the authors wish to thank the anonymous referee for many helpful suggestions , especially an observation that greatly simplified and improved the proof of theorem [ one - face ] ( 2 ) .",
