    "7 , by using the values @xcite @xmath84 , @xmath85 and a dephasing time parameter @xmath86 .",
    "a quantitative fitting is inhibited by the fact that the background contribution to w does not follow the korringa law , in view of correlation effects among carriers @xcite . a firm deduction , however , is that an anisotropy parameter @xmath87 , and namely a crossover to a 3d regime , is required to avoid unrealistic values ( 2d line in figure 2a ) , as indicated also by magnetization measurements ( see later on ) .",
    "mitrovic et al .",
    "@xcite have discussed the field dependence of @xmath88 in terms of quenching of the dos term only , by resorting to the theory of eschrig et al . @xcite .",
    "the field dependence of the sf contribution to the relaxation rate is a delicate issue , because of the nontrivial interplay of many parameters which include reduced temperature @xmath89 , reduced field @xmath90 , anisotropy parameter @xmath91 , elastic and phase breaking times @xmath55 and @xmath92 .",
    "eschrig et al .",
    "@xcite have extended the analitical approach @xcite by taking into account arbitrary values of @xmath93 , short - wave fluctuations and dynamical fluctuations .",
    "the price of this generalization is the restriction to a 2d spectrum of sf fluctuations . in view of our experimental findings",
    "the analysis of the field effect in a purely 2d framework is questionable . on the other hand ,",
    "a re - examination of the field effect for a layered system is now possible by applying the method of the dos term regularization devised by budzin and varlamov @xcite , which has indicated how the divergences can be treated .",
    "since the dynamical fluctuations could be relevant only for fields of the order of @xmath94 , up to @xmath95 @xmath96 the fluctuations can be safely treated in the nearly static limit .",
    "the field dependence for weak fields ( @xmath97 ) turns out @xcite    @xmath98^{3/2}}\\beta^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath99 + \\psi ^{\\prime } ( 1/2)}=   \\bigg\\ { \\begin{tabular}{cc }   $ ] 14(3)/^3@xmath100t1@xmath1014t@xmath1021t1/@xmath103 ( here @xmath104 ) .",
    "so both effects of increase and of decrease of @xmath13 on increasing the magnetic field are possible , depending on the mean free path in the specific sample .",
    "if @xmath105 the main correction to @xmath13 is due to the mt term and one should observe @xmath13 decreasing with increasing field , while if @xmath106 the dos correction becomes dominant and @xmath13 is expected to increase .    as it appears from fig .",
    "2 the effect of the field for @xmath107 is small , if any . it is noted that if eq . 7 is applied to the underdoped compounds the reduction in the fermi energy @xmath108 and the increase in the anisotropy ( i.e. decrease of @xmath91 ) would imply a sizeable increase in @xmath109 .",
    "this enhancement in the underdoped compounds does not occur ( see fig . 2b and 2c for the chain - disordered and chain - ordered ybco s , respectively ) , unless the decrease of @xmath13 over a wide temperature range , usually related to the spin - gap opening @xcite , should be attributed to a field - independent dos term . on the other hand ,",
    "the conventional sf of gl character should occur only close to @xmath6 , where , on the contrary , @xmath50 is little temperature dependent .",
    "eq . 9 , in principle ,",
    "does predict a field dependence .",
    "however , if typical values @xmath110 k , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 are used , for @xmath114 one has @xmath115 , hardly to evidence for @xmath116 .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of the field dependence of the sf contribution to the relaxation rate is given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here we only remark that the results in strong fields ( @xmath117 ) from mitrovic et al .",
    "@xcite can hardly be justified on the basis of eq .",
    "as regards the magnetization measurements in optimally doped ybco , as already mentioned , our data indicate a 3d regime crossing from gaussian to critical fluctuations close to @xmath6 .",
    "the value of @xmath118 @xcite at the crossing point of the curves @xmath119 vs. @xmath29 turns out around @xmath120 , corresponding to an anisotropy factor @xmath121 .",
    "a collapse onto a common function is obtained when @xmath122 is plotted as a function of @xmath123 .",
    "the collapse fails in magnetic fields less than about 0.3 tesla .",
    "a small - field departure from the universal function has been already observed in underdoped compounds @xcite , but no mention about it is found in the literature for optimally doped ybco .    in the underdoped compounds a marked enhancement of the fluctuating magnetization is observed ( figs . 3 and 4 ) . in fig .",
    "4 the susceptibilty , defined as @xmath124 for @xmath125 tesla , is reported .",
    "the inset is a blow up of the results around the temperature where reversing of the sign of the magnetization occurs .",
    "the susceptibilities for chain - ordered and chain - disordered underdoped samples are compared with the one in optimally doped ybco in fig .",
    "5 .    in underdoped ybco",
    "the magnetization curves dramatically depart from the ones expected on the basis of eq . 2 and numerical derivative .",
    "no crossing point is observed in the curves @xmath7 vs @xmath29 and no collapse is found on anisotropic 3d or 2d - like curves for @xmath126 or @xmath7 vs @xmath127 ( fig .",
    "these anomalies are more manifested in the chain ordered compound , as it can be realized from the peculiar shape of the isothermal magnetization vs. @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "one could remark that a fraction of a few percent of non - percolating local superconducting regions can account for the absolute value of the diamagnetic susceptibility and for the shape of the magnetization curves .",
    "a trivial chemical inhomogeneity could be suspected .",
    "the fact that the anomalous diamagnetism has been observed in three samples differently prepared and since it is strongly enhanced in the chain - ordered ones , supports the intrinsic origin of the phenomenon .",
    "recent theories @xcite have discussed how a distribution of local superconducting temperatures , related to charge inhomogeneities , can cause anomalous diamagnetic effects .",
    "mesoscopic charge inhomogeneities have been predicted on the basis of various theoretical approaches @xcite .",
    "in underdoped compounds one could expect the occurrence of preformed cooper pairs causing `` local '' superconductivity lacking of long - range phase coherence .",
    "an inhomogeneous distribution of carriers , on a mesoscopic scale , is supported by @xmath128 plane optical conductivity @xcite and it is the basic ingredient of the stripes model @xcite .",
    "since the anomalous diamagnetism is enhanced in chain - ordered underdoped ybco one is tempted to relate it to the presence of stripes .",
    "the insurgence of phase coherence among adjacent charge - rich regions can qualitatively be expected to yield strong screening above the bulk superconducting temperature @xcite .",
    "therefore , one could phenomenologically describe the role of sf in underdoped compounds , as follows . at @xmath129 , just below @xmath130 , fluctuating pairs are formed , without long - range phase coherence .",
    "below @xmath131 , about @xmath132 k above @xmath6 , phase coherence among adjacent charge - rich drops @xcite start to develop , yielding the formation of superconducting loops with strong screening and causing the onset of the anomalous diamagnetism .",
    "close to @xmath6 , sf of gl character occur and long - range phase coherence sets in .",
    "by combining magnetization and nmr - nqr relaxation measurements , an attempt has been done to clarify the role of superconducting fluctuations and of fluctuating diamagnetism in underdoped ybco , vis - a - vis the optimally doped compound . in the latter case",
    "the fluctuations above @xmath6 are rather well described by an anisotropic ginzburg - landau ( gl ) functional and by scaling arguments for slightly anisotropic systems .",
    "a breakdown of the gaussian approximation for small magnetic fields has been observed close to @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath0cu relaxation rates @xmath13 around @xmath6 show little field dependence , if any .",
    "one can not rule out the presence of a mt contribution , and then of a small @xmath133wave component in the spectrum of the fluctuations , which should be sample - dependent in view of the role of impurities in the pair - breaking mechanisms .",
    "in underdoped ybco an anomalous diamagnetism is observed , on a large temperature range .",
    "the diamagnetic susceptibility at @xmath6 is about an order of magnitude larger than the one in the optimally doped sample and the isothermal magnetization curves can not be described by the anisotropic gl functional .",
    "scaling arguments , such as the search of an universal function in terms of @xmath134 , appear inadequate to justify the experimental findings .",
    "the anomalies are more marked in the chain - ordered samples .",
    "also in the underdoped ybco @xmath0cu @xmath13 in nqr almost coincide with the nmr ones at @xmath135 tesla , in agreement with a theoretical estimate of the effect of the magnetic field .",
    "another conclusion drawn from the field and temperature dependences of the @xmath0cu relaxation rate is that the spin gap does not depend on the magnetic field and that the behavior of the spin susceptibility for @xmath129 can not be ascribed to sf of gl character .",
    "the fluctuating diamagnetism observed in underdoped ybco can be phenomenologically accounted for by the presence of charge inhomogeneities at mesoscopic level .",
    "the anomalies in the magnetization curves can be attributed to `` locally superconducting '' non - percolating drops , present above the bulk @xmath6 and favoured by chain ordering .",
