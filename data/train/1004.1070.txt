    "the aim of this paper is an introduction of a new method of analysis of a space of states of a given system .",
    "if the analysed system is not large , we are able to find all its possible states , and we can also separate states which demonstrate some property , e.g. minimum of energy . subsequently we can investigate the topology of the state space , to indicate important properties of states .",
    "+ if we are able to define the way one state of a system can be transformed into another , we can think of a space of states as a network of states .",
    "links in this network indicate possible transitions between states .",
    "if not all possible transitions are equally probable , the obtained network is weighted .",
    "the network of states can be analysed for identification of groups of nodes which are more densely connected to each other than to the remaining nodes in the system , i.e. the network of states can be divided into communities .",
    "existence of connections between states means that the diffusion or the random walk in such system can be analysed @xcite .",
    "both those processes are interesting from the perspective of spreading information across the network .",
    "such a phenomenon is important in many different areas of interest , to mention only sociology , economy or biology .",
    "also communities are important from this point of view .",
    "the question is if we are able to indicate some characteristic properties of states which are classified to one community .",
    "if this is the case the time dependence of these properties can be analysed within the frames of the random walk theory .",
    "the analysis is performed for two systems .",
    "the first one is the space of ground states of a triangular lattice with the antiferromagnetic ising model .",
    "its important feature is the frustration whose source lies in an even number of nearest neighbours of each spin and its two possible orientations . for an analysed system",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "the number of possible states of the system strongly increases with the size of a lattice .",
    "here we discuss the space of ground states , for lattices of two different numbers of nodes : @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "triangular lattice was also one the systems analysed in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "there we have shown that it is possible to pass by one - spin flip from one ground state into another .",
    "the number of states a given state can be transformed to is different for different states . because of that the whole set of ground states can be divided into classes , where states which belong to a given class are connected by one - spin flip with the same number of other ground states .",
    "it was also shown @xcite that in the case of a triangular lattice of size @xmath5 the space of ground states can be divided into three equally sized subsets , within which it is possible to move through all states changing an orientation of only one spin between two subsequent states .",
    "such a situation indicates that for this system a kind of a constant of motion exists , which has three different values for those three subsets .",
    "the definition of this constant of motion is perhaps not unique .",
    "here we present the results of the analysis of the correlation function within these subsets .",
    "what we also present is the calculation of the density of motives which are observed for the antiferromagnetic ising model on triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "the second analysed system is the space of states of a roundabout . in general",
    "the number of roads , and particularly the number of vehicles which can occupy them , can be very large . because of computational limitations we are able to analyse small systems only .",
    "it , however , does not change the generality of considerations . if the given number of access and exit roads is assumed , as well as a finite number of vehicles which can occupy each road",
    ", the system has a finite number of states .",
    "here we analyse a system which consists of three access roads and three exit roads .",
    "the maximal number of vehicles on each road is limited to 2 .",
    "+ what we are interested in is the analysis of communities which possible states of the system can be divided into",
    ". such a division indicates states which show similar properties , e.g. have the same number of fully occupied or empty roads .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : in the next section the analysis of the triangular lattice is presented .",
    "we analyse correlation function for the lattice of @xmath3 .",
    "the analysis of a density of characteristic motives for @xmath3 and @xmath4 is presented , and their connection with classes of states .",
    "the next section is devoted to analysis of the roundabout system .",
    "we analyse possible transitions between states , and their division into communities .",
    "the last section contains concluding remarks .",
    "the first analysed system is a triangular lattice the nodes of which are decorated by spins which fulfil the ising model @xcite , i.e. two possible spin orientations @xmath6 are allowed .",
    "energy in the case of absence of an external magnetic field is given by the formula : @xmath7 where : @xmath8 .",
    "if an antiferromagnetic interaction is assumed , @xmath9 , this means that the preferred mutual spin orientation is antiparallel . in the above equation summing up",
    "goes via pairs of nearest neighbours .",
    "+ the ground state energy for the lattice of @xmath3 is equal to @xmath10 and for @xmath4 equals @xmath11 which means that on average for each triangle there is one frustrated spin .",
    "the number of ground states in the first case is equal to @xmath12 and in the second is @xmath13 .",
    "exemplary ground state for the lattice of @xmath3 is shown in fig.[fig0 ] .    .",
    "]      in our previous paper @xcite it was shown that for the triangular lattice with @xmath3 nodes the whole set of ground states can be divided into three equally sized subsets which were obtained by means of the breadth - first search ( bfs ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "we start from a randomly chosen ground state , and all other ground states which can be achieved by one - spin flip from the selected one are marked . in the next step ,",
    "configurations are marked transformable from those marked in the previous step .",
    "the procedure is repeated until all configurations are marked , or none can be selected . in the latter case , we check if another subset of ground states can be identified applying the same procedure for all states which were not marked so far . in the end , all @xmath12 ground states were divided into three equally sized subsets @xmath14 .",
    "this means an existence of a three - fold symmetry and a constant of motion with different values for three obtained subsets .    for each ground state",
    "the correlation function with nearest neighbours of each spin along three axis of the system is calculated . if we denote three directions of the triangular lattice as @xmath15 , then : @xmath16 \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] obtained values are the same for all ground states , and are equal to @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath17 ( the order arbitrarily chosen ) .",
    "the difference between the three subsets is only in the order of values .",
    "this result indicates that in each subset a different axis is highlighted .",
    "so we observed an anisotropy of the correlation function .    as it was shown in @xcite in ground states of the ising model on triangular lattice , characteristic motives are observed . here",
    "we check if the density of these motives for given ground state is a quantity which can be used for indication of their specific properties , e.g. possibilities of its transformation into other ground states .",
    "analysed motives are presented in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "in @xcite motives of type  ii and iii were not distinguished .",
    "here we show that their separation can be meaningful .",
    "white and black colour of nodes in the figure indicate two possible spin orientations , inversion of all spins is seen as the same motive . in the case of motive of type",
    "i the node in the middle ( grey colour ) can be with equal probability in one of two possible orientations .",
    "the reason is the fact that spin when three of his neighbours are  up  and three are  down  is frustrated .",
    "it means that for both its orientations the energy is exactly the same .    for each motive one should also consider its possible rotations around the central node .",
    "this , with combination of inversion , gives @xmath2 motives of type  i , @xmath19 motives of type  ii and @xmath20 motives of type  iii .",
    "the way of spin arrangement in the ground state strongly depends on the size of a system , which is intuitively understandable .",
    "one can expect that if linear size of the lattice is a multiple of three , mindful of the two possible spin orientations , imposed periodic boundary conditions will allow for an alternating arrangement of  down  and  up  spins along one axis .    here",
    "we check if the anisotropy of the system manifests also in the density of different types of motives .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     particularly interesting are isolated states , as they can be seen as  special  states .",
    "they can perform a crucial role in traffic , either as states which allow for reduction of traffic jams , or on the contrary can be a source of it .",
    "in some cases the solution can be found in the same system .",
    "if a given road is fully occupied the roundabout can be left through an empty exit road , even if such resolution is connected with a higher cost . in some situations it is worth taking a longer way than to get in a traffic jam .",
    "in this paper we have analysed the space of states of two systems : the ising model on a finite triangular lattice and the roundabout with access roads and exit roads . in both cases the space forms a network of states .",
    "the method of our analysis is general and it can be applied to any other systems , where states can be described with discrete numbers .",
    "the most important limitation of the method is that the number of states strongly increases with the system size .",
    "however , a new insight can be reached also for small and moderate systems .    for the triangular lattice of size @xmath3 a new analysis of the correlation functions and density of characteristic motifs",
    "has been added to our previous results presented in @xcite . from the density of different motifs , an anisotropy of the correlation function",
    "is found within three separate subsets ( communities ) of states .",
    "the number of subsets is a consequence of the three - fold symmetry of the triangular lattice .",
    "more general , the symmetry of the state network reflects the symmetry of the investigated system . within the communities",
    ", this symmetry can be broken . in the case of the ising system of @xmath5 nodes ,",
    "what is broken is the rotational symmetry of the triangular lattice , as we observe anisotropic spin - spin correlation function within the communities . on the contrary ,",
    "the up - down symmetry of the ising model remains preserved within the communities , as one can reverse all spins flipping them one by one without an increase of energy .",
    "the lattice of @xmath4 nodes is analysed here for the first time . in this case",
    "we found some isolated states , i.e. communities which contain one state only . in these states",
    ", a flip of any spin leads to an increase of energy of the system . having these states excluded",
    ", we found that there is a path through all remaining ground states on which subsequent moves are one - spin flips .",
    "analysis of the density of motives also in this case allows to indicate common properties of states in the state network .",
    "also , the number of neighbours of states in the state network was used for the indication of classes of the ground states of the system .",
    "further , this classification is enriched to subclasses by taking into account the classes of the neighbours .",
    "the differentiation procedure is closed in two steps .",
    "this is an important difference between our networks of states and disordered networks ; in the latter , the number of subclasses could reach to the number of nodes .",
    "our second example - a roundabout - is entirely different from the first one , and this difference can be seen as an argument on the universality of the method . here",
    "also the division of states into classes and subclasses has been made .",
    "on the contrary to the previous example the state space is connected , then a community here is a set of states connected mutually more densely than to states from other community @xcite .",
    "the results of the method of differential equations @xcite indicate that the communities found in the roundabout differ in the number of empty or full pairs of roads .",
    "therefore , possible transitions between the communities of the roundabout may be important if we look in the broader perspective .",
    "formation of traffic jams on one of the roundabouts can be a source of communication problems in a wider area .",
    "monitoring of the whole communication network allows for an indication of areas with already existing traffic jams or on which the high probability of their formation occurs ; this in turn allows for suggesting drivers to use detours .",
    "this application will be discussed in a separate work .",
    "collecting data on the topology of the state space are important and should be useful in constructing the master equations for the time evolution of the probability of a given system .",
    "in particular , the diffusion on networks is known @xcite to depend directly on the network topology . with the data on classes , subclasses and communities",
    ", it should be possible to determine the time dependence of observables , which are characteristic for the communities of a given systems .",
    "further applications of the data could include an identification of bottlenecks and calculation of exit times from particular communities to the rest of the space network .",
