    "the elliptic flow @xmath0 is one of the most important observables in high energy non - central nucleus - nucleus collisions at rhic  @xcite .",
    "it is very sensitive to both the initial condition in the overlap zone , and to the subsequent evolution of the hot matter created in these collisions  @xcite .",
    "predictions from ideal hydrodynamics with an initial condition from a glauber type model and with a short thermalization time @xmath1 fm / c are compatible with the elliptic flow data at low transverse momentum at rhic  @xcite energies .",
    "this is one of the strongest indications of early thermalization and nearly perfect - fluid evolution of the quark - gluon plasma at rhic .",
    "it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that ideal hydrodynamics with the initial condition taken from the color glass condensate ( cgc ) approach  @xcite overestimates the measured elliptic flow at rhic . since hadronic dissipative effects were taken into account by a hadronic transport model  @xcite , additional dissipation in the quark - gluon phase would be required .",
    "the reason for the strong flow is that the kln approach  @xcite predicts a larger eccentricity of the initial gluon distribution in the transverse plane than the glauber model  @xcite .",
    "a recent calculation within the classical yang - mills ( cym ) approach on the lattice  @xcite gave somewhat smaller values than predicted by the kln model .",
    "nevertheless , the eccentricity of the `` overlap '' region in coordinate space obtained from cym still exceeds that predicted by the glauber `` wounded nucleon '' model for soft processes .",
    "the eccentricity @xmath2 is defined in the transverse plane @xmath3 perpendicular to the beam axis by @xmath4 the average may be taken with respect to either energy or particle density ( or entropy , if rapid thermalization is assumed ) . in the ideal hydrodynamical limit",
    "@xcite , elliptic flow only depends on the density and on @xmath2 . therefore , it is very important to know the initial conditions to extract properties of hot and dense matter created in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "this paper is a continuation of ref .",
    "@xcite , where we computed the eccentricity in the initial stage of heavy ion collisions within the kln approach , and showed that the large eccentricity predicted by the @xmath5-factorization approach is generic , as it does not depend on the details of the unintegrated gluon distribution function ( ugdf ) such as the presence of leading - twist shadowing and an extended geometric scaling window  @xcite .",
    "the predictions of the cgc framework are consistent with rhic data for the centrality , energy and rapidity dependence of the multiplicity of charged hadrons if the square of the saturation scale ( averaged over the transverse plane ) is defined to be proportional to the number of participants @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall consider in more detail the relation between the different definitions of the saturation scales ( see also the short note in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the eccentricity could of course fluctuate for many reasons , and it was recently argued that event - by - event flow fluctuations can affect the elliptic flow obtained via correlation methods  @xcite . in order to explore such fluctuation effects in the cgc picture , we employ a monte - carlo implementation of the kln approach which accounts for fluctuations of the high - rapidity `` hard sources '' ( nucleons ) in the transverse plane .",
    "this leads naturally to a factorized version of the kln approach , where the ugdfs depend only on the properties of a single nucleus .",
    "we analyze the effects of the fluctuations on the eccentricity by using different definitions of the eccentricities  @xcite .",
    "this is relevant to the study of the effects of fluctuations on @xmath0  @xcite .",

    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the transverse momentum and the rapidity of the produced gluons , respectively .",
    "the light - cone momentum fractions of the colliding gluon ladders are then given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the center of mass energy and @xmath9 is the rapidity of the produced gluon .",
    "we set @xmath12 such that the minimal saturation scale @xmath13 in the above integration is @xmath14  gev ( see , however , below ) .",

    "the density of participants is not a universal quantity which depends only on the properties of a single nucleus . in the following we propose a modified form of the kln approach where factorization is manifest and",

    "this quantity can be obtained by averaging over the thickness functions of @xmath34 nucleons , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the thickness function for @xmath37 nucleons in a row .",
    "this allows us to construct an ugdf in the following way , @xmath38 here , and in the following , we use a short - hand notation for the dependence of @xmath39 on some density @xmath40 : @xmath41 .",
    "the ugdf ( [ eq : phi_factorized ] ) respects factorization , since it depends only on the properties of a single nucleus .",
    "the saturation scale is then parameterized as @xmath42 @xmath43 can be taken from the glauber definition of @xmath44 : @xmath45 in this case , @xmath46 is a sampling area and not the nucleon - nucleon inelastic cross section as in the glauber model .",
    "nevertheless , these quantities are related to each other , since @xmath46 should be on the order of the area of the nucleon .",
    "one could fix its value in such a way that one recovers the saturation scale of a nucleon in the limit @xmath47 , since @xmath48 for our simulations we will however use the value of the inelastic cross section at rhic energy , since then the results are more directly comparable to the original kln ansatz . the saturation scale of a nucleon is then equal to @xmath49 .",
    "we refer to this approach as the factorized kln ( fkln ) model .",
    "next , we explore the relation to the original kln ansatz , where the saturation momentum is defined via @xmath44 . the transverse density of produced gluons can roughly be expressed analytically in terms of the saturation scales as  @xcite @xmath50 where , @xmath51 and @xmath52 denote the larger and the smaller value of the two saturation scales in opposite nuclei at any fixed position in the transverse plane .",
    "it is easy to see that this function is homogeneous of order one in both @xmath53 and @xmath54 , or in the corresponding densities which appear in the definition of the saturation scales .",

    "the fkln approach is rather similar to the original kln approach .",
    "this is due to the fact that the single - inclusive gluon cross section is homogeneous of order one in both arguments , as discussed above .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ecc_pa ] , we compare the eccentricities obtained from fkln ( eq .  ( [ eq : ecc ] ) ) and kln .",
    "we plot two cases , where we use the transverse energy density @xmath60 and the number density as a weight in the definition of the eccentricity .",
    "the eccentricity from fkln is somewhat lower than the one from kln , especially for more peripheral collisions .",
    "this is due to the fact that the transverse energy distribution from the kln approach is homogeneous of order 3/2 , because of another factor of @xmath51  @xcite : @xmath61 as a consequence , the energy density distributions in the transverse plane from kln and fkln , respectively , are somewhat different .",
    "if one uses the number density of produced gluons rather than their energy density as a weight in the definition of the eccentricity , one would expect that the fkln form reproduces the kln result , since the same arguments hold as for the multiplicity .",
    "however , we have found that the fkln prediction for the eccentricity with the number density as a weight is almost identical to the above result ( which employed energy density as a weight ) .",
    "this can be traced back to the above - mentioned cut - off @xmath62 . in the fkln model",
    "no such cutoff is needed as the minimal saturation momentum never drops below the saturation momentum of a single nucleon , by construction .",
    "rather , the probabilities @xmath27 , @xmath63 of encountering at least one nucleon vanish at the surface of the overlap region .",
    "even though it does not make much sense physically , technically we can set the minimal saturation scale in the kln model to zero .",
    "then the eccentricity from the kln approach agrees well with the one from the factorized fkln form as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ecc_pa ] .",
    "according to the ideas of mclerran and venugopalan , the gluon field of a sufficiently large nucleus can be viewed as a classical yang - mills field  @xcite .",
    "particle production in high - energy hadronic collisions can then be calculated by solving the yang - mills equations in the forward light - cone with a boundary condition corresponding to classical sources on its two branches .",
    "real time solutions of the classical yang - mills fields on the lattice were obtained , for example , in refs .",
    "those numerical solutions are usually averaged over many different initial conditions ( configurations of the color - charge sources ) .    here",
    ", we calculate the thickness function used for determining the saturation scale with a monte carlo method .",
    "there are two advantages of doing this .",
    "first , the monte - carlo implementation naturally leads to a definition of the saturation momentum in terms of the thickness functions ( which preserves factorization ) .",
    "second , we can study the effects of event - by - event fluctuations on the eccentricity within the kln approach .",
    "we only consider fluctuations of the positions of the nucleons , which were previously studied in refs .",
    "@xcite within the glauber approach .",
    "we note that in ref .",
    "@xcite , a similar method was employed to impose a color neutrality condition for a each nucleon in the classical mclerran - venugopalan model in order to simulate collisions of finite nuclei .",
    "let us now construct a monte carlo model for gluon production for each configuration of nucleons within the colliding nuclei ( denoted as mc - kln ) .",
    "we first determine the positions of @xmath19 nucleons according to the woods - saxon distribution .",
    "correlations among the nucleons are neglected at present but could in principle be taken into account .",
    "they tend to reduce fluctuations somewhat  @xcite .    the local density of nucleons , @xmath64 ,",
    "is then obtained by counting nucleons within a tube of radius @xmath65 around a given transverse coordinate @xmath28 : @xmath66 the area @xmath46 is the sampling area over which we count nucleons .",
    "the average @xmath67 reproduces the convoluted thickness function @xmath68 with a sampling profile @xmath69 : @xmath70 in the limit @xmath71 , @xmath72 equals @xmath21 .",
    "this limit can be taken in a monte carlo by the oversampling ( `` test - particle '' ) technique , whereby the sampling area @xmath46 is reduced by some factor @xmath73 and the number of nucleons is increased by the same factor ; each nucleon then carries a weight @xmath74 .",
    "( we found that oversampling by a factor of @xmath75 gives stable results . )",
    "it is not appropriate to simply decrease @xmath46 .",
    "while this would reproduce the mean value of @xmath21 , it would also change the fluctuations in the number of nucleons at a given position , since each nucleon would contribute @xmath76 to the density . with the oversampling technique",
    "each nucleon has a weight @xmath74 and therefore contributes @xmath77 to the density , which is independent of @xmath73 .",
    "however , correlations between neighboring points in the transverse plane are destroyed .",
    "therefore , event - by - event observables can not be obtained with this method ; we employed it only to test convergence of our mc implementation to the `` mean - field '' results presented above and for the computation of averaged observables . in the following simulations , we choose @xmath78 as in the mean - field fkln approach above .",
    "we then follow the same procedure to compute @xmath79 , thereby generating two configurations for nucleus @xmath19 and @xmath80 , respectively , at a specified impact parameter .",
    "the saturation scale at a given transverse coordinate is then given by @xmath81 and similarly for nucleus @xmath80 .",
    "it is clear that this choice of the saturation scale only depends on the properties of one nucleus , and therefore respects factorization .    for each generated configuration",
    "we apply the @xmath5-factorization formula  ( [ eq : ktfac ] ) to obtain the distribution of produced gluons in the transverse plane .",
    "we then average over many collisions to compute observables and their fluctuations .",
    "finally , we establish the relation between mc - kln and fkln .",
    "the average ugdf which is effectively employed in the mc - kln model may be written as @xmath82 where we used @xmath83",
    ". the fkln ugdf may be obtained from the approximation where @xmath36 is replaced by the average , @xmath84 : @xmath85 where @xmath86 was used .       in au+au collisions predicted by the various models .",
    "fkln and mc - kln give almost identical results .",

    ", width=302 ]    first , we show the centrality dependence of the multiplicity from the mc - kln model in fig .",
    "[ fig : npart_ta_mc ] together with the result of the original kln approach . for clarity",
    ", we have not adjusted the overall normalization to the most central events .",
    "the multiplicity as a function of the centrality from mc - kln is very similar to the original kln and to the fkln approach .",
    "the overall normalization is about 5% lower .",
    "the reason is that the multiplicity as a function of the density has negative curvature ( second derivative ) , so fluctuations reduce the multiplicity .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ecc_ta_mc ] , we compare the eccentricity among the various approaches . since the fkln result was obtained using a delta function sampling profile ( by using @xmath21 instead of @xmath72 ) , we employed the oversampling technique with a factor @xmath75 for the mc - kln model .",
    "this way , the two models use the same sampling profile and the results are comparable . it can be seen that the eccentricity from mc - kln is almost identical to the fkln scaling , which is slightly higher than @xmath87 scaling .",
    "note that any additional fluctuation ( e.g. in the evolution of the bfkl - ladders ) would not influence the standard eccentricity ( [ eq : ecc ] ) , which is due to its definition ; the denominator and the numerator are averaged separately and both are linear functions of the weight .    the eccentricity from the cym approach  @xcite behaves similar to the number of collision scaling in the glauber model .",
    "note that the cym approach in ref .  @xcite does not include effects of nucleon fluctuations .",
    "hence , we conclude that the main reason for the reduced eccentricity as compared to the original kln approach is the use of the thickness functions in the definition of the saturation scale as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite . both , the cym approach from ref .",
    "@xcite and our fkln approach , however , predicted larger @xmath2 than the glauber model for soft collisions where @xmath88 scales with the density of participants @xmath89 .",
    "we now turn to a comparison of various definitions of the eccentricity which are relevant for the scaling properties of the experimental data for @xmath0 .",
    "since we now consider event - by - event variables , we can not use oversampling any more .",
    "this changes the results somehow , since the interaction range of the nucleon - nucleon interaction plays some role . in appendix",
    "[ appendixa ] , we summarize how to include the interaction range in the numerical computations of the number of participants and collisions .",
    "first we define the participant eccentricity @xmath90 according to ref .",
    "@xcite in order to account for fluctuations in the directions of the major axes of the overlap region and of the `` center of gravity '' , @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the rms widths of the participant nucleon distribution projected on the @xmath94 and @xmath95 axes , respectively , and @xmath96 .",
    "we also compute @xmath97 which is closely related to the event - plane method of the measurements of elliptic flow . for four - particle cumulants of azimuthal correlations",

    "the standard eccentricity is reduced somewhat , since we did not use the oversampling technique in this plot ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : ecc_glauber ] of appendix a ) . as observed before @xcite in the glauber model approach , @xmath99 deviates most from the standard definition , and the deviation is much larger for smaller systems .",
    "since the source of fluctuations in this work is the position of the nucleons , the influence of the fluctuations on the results is very similar to that of the glauber model approach .     and @xmath102 of mc - kln relative to the glauber model result .",
    ", width=302 ]    a detailed comparison to the glauber eccentricity can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ecc_ratio ] , where we show the ratio of the eccentricity obtained by the mc - kln model to the eccentricity of the glauber model . in au+au collisions ,",

    "so far we assumed that additional fluctuations ( e.g. from the evolution of the bfkl - ladders ) in the gluon production are negligible . while this is true for the standard definition of the eccentricity , it does not necessarily hold for event - by - event definitions such as @xmath104 and @xmath105 . in these cases ,",
    "the eccentricity might increase .",
    "we tested this assumption by including simple poissonian fluctuations in the gluon number but found that @xmath99 increased by only about @xmath106 .",

    "it naturally leads to a gluon production cross section which respects factorization .",
    "the multiplicity as a function of centrality does not change much as compared to the original kln approach but the predicted eccentricity is somewhat lower .    [",
    "sec : ecc_thr ] it should be noted , however , that the gluon distribution calculated here corresponds to very early times on the order of @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , it is not necessarily identifiable with the initial condition for hydrodynamics since it could be modified during the thermalization stage .",
    "a detailed analysis requires simulations of the time evolution from the early production time @xmath108 until thermalization .",
    "this could be done within parton cascade models  @xcite which should be coupled to the yang - mills equations describing the soft gluons  @xcite .",
    "this is beyond the purpose of the present paper .",
    "our qualitative expectation is that the low - density surfaces of the overlap zone may not thermalize ( and should therefore not be included in the initial condition for hydrodynamics ) , while the gluons produced closer to the center do .",
    "we can assess the consequences of such a simple picture by increasing the minimal saturation scale @xmath109 which acts as a cutoff .",
    "this amounts to removing the very high-@xmath8 gluon jets as well as the low - density part of the bulk near the surface . the effect on the eccentricity is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ecc_thr ] .",
    "one observes that the eccentricity increases significantly with the cutoff .",
    "the fact that @xmath2 is flat up to @xmath110  gev is due to the construction of the fkln ugdf : the saturation scale never drops below that for a single nucleon and smaller cutoffs therefore do not matter . since no thermalization is expected to occur in @xmath111 or @xmath112 collisions , the relevant cutoff for the hydrodynamic initial condition might be well above @xmath113  gev",
    ". it would be interesting to study the hydrodynamical evolution of various initial conditions in order to check how sensitive the elliptic flow responds .",
    "another advantage of the fkln ugdf is that it reproduces the correct scaling of the multiplicity with @xmath114 at high @xmath115 in the dglap regime .",
    "this is not the case for the original kln ansatz .",
    "there , the high-@xmath115 multiplicity also scales with @xmath116 , but with @xmath117 , one does not recover scaling with @xmath118 . as we have shown , the naive modification to @xmath119 does not help , since the saturation momentum at the edge of a nucleus drops below that for a single nucleon , and the @xmath5-factorization formula does not reproduce the centrality dependence of the multiplicity .",
    "our fkln ( and mc - kln ) ugdf solves these problems simultaneously : while it fits correctly the measured centrality dependence of the multiplicity , it does not break factorization , the nuclear saturation scale is bound from below by the saturation scale of a single nucleon , and it reproduces the correct @xmath87 scaling at high @xmath115 .",

    "the number of participants within the interaction range corresponds to using the convoluted thickness functions for both nuclei .",
    "the corresponding definitions for the participant and collision densities are : @xmath130 here the cross section is used in two ways : once for determining the interaction , and once for sampling the nucleons over the transverse area given by the cross section . strictly speaking ,",

    "<S> we introduce a modified form of the kharzeev - levin - nardi ( kln ) approach for nuclear collisions . the new _ ansatz _ for the unintegrated gluon distribution function preserves factorization , and the saturation scale is bound from below by that for a single nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> it also reproduces the correct scaling with the number of collisions at high transverse momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding monte carlo implementation allows us to account for fluctuations of the hard sources ( nucleons ) in the transverse plane . </S>",
    "<S> we compute various definitions of the eccentricity within the new approach , which are relevant for the interpretation of the elliptic flow . </S>",
    "<S> our approach predicts breaking of the scaling of the eccentricity with the glauber eccentricity at the level of about 30% . </S>"
