    "the rare decay @xmath6 is one of the very useful channels for the study of models beyond standard model .",
    "this deeply depends on more precise calculations of this decay rate .",
    "although some calculations show that there exist large @xmath7 resonance contributions , which interfere with short distance contributions @xcite , there is still a window in the invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath5 pair for short distance contributions to be dominant @xcite .",
    "furthermore , window also exists for short distance to be dominant in the one lepton energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "the qcd corrected coefficients of effective operators from @xmath8 are also important for the exclusive processes such as @xmath9 .",
    "the decay of @xmath10 and its large leading log qcd corrections have already been calculated in many papers @xcite . and also some efforts are made to give a next to leading log calculations @xcite which is estimated within 20% contribution .",
    "all these efforts make it easy for experiments to detect this channel .",
    "however , all these papers do not include the qcd running from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "since the top quark is found to be 2-times heavier than w gauge boson @xcite , it needs a detail calculation for the effect of the qcd running from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "further more , unlike the @xmath11 case , here the electromagnetic penguin is numerically less important than the box diagrams and z boson penguin , although it is much enhanced by leading - log qcd corrections",
    ". meanwhile , the important box diagrams and z boson penguins have no leading - log qcd corrections as a running from @xmath2 to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the only leading - log qcd corrections may come from running from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .    in the present paper , by using effective field theory formalism in standard model , we recalculate the @xmath6 decay including qcd running from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , in addition to corrections from @xmath2 to @xmath4 , so as to give a complete leading log results .",
    "first in the next section , we integrate out the top quark , generating a five - quark effective hamiltonian . by using the renormalization group equation",
    ", we run the effective field theory down to the w - scale , so as to give out the qcd corrections from @xmath1 to @xmath2 . in section 3 ,",
    "the weak gauge bosons are integrated out at @xmath2 scale .",
    "then we continue running the effective hamiltonian down to b - quark scale to include qcd corrections from @xmath2 to @xmath4 . in section 4 ,",
    "the differential branching ratio is given as a function of the invariant mass of the @xmath12 pair .",
    "our results will be useful for experiments to distinguish backgrounds like @xmath13 resonance .",
    "section 5 is a short summary .",
    "at first , in the standard model lagrangian , we integrate out the top quark , generating an effective theory , introducing dimension-5 and dimension-6 effective operators as to include effects of the absent top quark .",
    "higher dimension operators are suppressed by a factor of @xmath16 , where @xmath17 characterize the interesting external momentum of b quark @xmath18 . for leading order of @xmath19 ,",
    "dimension-6 operators are good enough to make a complete basis of operators : @xmath20 here @xmath21 stands for @xmath22 and the covariant derivative is defined as @xmath23 with @xmath24 denoting the qcd coupling constant .",
    "the tensor @xmath25 appearing in @xmath26 assumes the following lorentz structure , the index @xmath27 ranging from 1 to 4 : @xmath28 the subscript @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the above formula denote left - handed and right - handed quarks , respectively . here operators involving @xmath31 are not included because their coefficients are suppressed by @xmath32 and they do not mix with other operators .",
    "then we can write down our intermediate effective hamiltonian : @xmath33 where @xmath34 represents the @xmath35 unitary kobayashi - maskawa matrix elements .    the coefficients @xmath36 can be derived through matching green functions calculated from the standard model with that from the intermediate effective theory @xcite . keeping only leading order of @xmath16 , the coefficients relevant to @xmath11 decay",
    "are already given in ref.@xcite , here we only give the new ones : @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "the renormalization group equation satisfied by the coefficient functions @xmath39 is @xmath40 the anomalous dimension matrix @xmath41 is calculated in practice by requiring renormalization group equations for green functions with insertions of composite operators to be satisfied order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "only the last five operators in equation ( [ operator ] ) are different from that of @xmath11 case @xcite . after evaluating the loop diagrams , we get the leading order anomalous dimensions for each of the operators in our basis . since there are so many operators , it is a very large matrix of anomalous dimensions @xcite . here",
    "we only list the part new from that of @xmath42 case : @xmath43",
    "in order to continue running the operator coefficients down to lower scales , one must integrate out the weak gauge bosons w , z and would - be goldstone bosons @xmath54 at @xmath52 scale .",
    "the matching conditions involving four - quark operators and photon , gluon penguin diagrams are the same as @xmath11 case@xcite .",
    "we here only display the following relations between coefficient functions just below(- ) and above(+ ) @xmath52 scale , which is relevant to @xmath55 : @xmath56 the first two terms in the right side of @xmath57 and @xmath58 arise from box diagrams with w boson couples to top quark ; the third terms arise from box diagrams with w boson coupling to charm quark .",
    "the function @xmath59 arise from graphs with a z gauge boson coupling to the @xmath12 pair , while the @xmath60 function arises from graphs with a photon couples to the @xmath12 pair .",
    "they are defined as , @xmath61    in addition to these , there are new four - quark operators from integrating out the w boson@xcite : @xmath62 , \\nonumber\\\\ o_4&=&(\\overline{s}_{l\\alpha } \\gamma^{\\mu } b_{l\\beta } )          [ ( \\overline{u}_{l\\beta } \\gamma_{\\mu } u_{l\\alpha})+ ... +          ( \\overline{b}_{l\\beta } \\gamma_{\\mu } b_{l\\alpha } ) ] , \\nonumber\\\\ o_5&=&(\\overline{s}_{l\\alpha } \\gamma^{\\mu } b_{l\\alpha } )          [ ( \\overline{u}_{r\\beta } \\gamma_{\\mu } u_{r\\beta})+ ... +          ( \\overline{b}_{r\\beta } \\gamma_{\\mu } b_{r\\beta } ) ] , \\nonumber\\\\ o_6&=&(\\overline{s}_{l\\alpha } \\gamma^{\\mu } b_{l\\beta } )          [ ( \\overline{u}_{r\\beta } \\gamma_{\\mu } u_{r\\alpha})+ ... +          ( \\overline{b}_{r\\beta } \\gamma_{\\mu } b_{r\\alpha})],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with coefficients @xmath63    there should also be two magnetic moment operators relevant to @xmath64 , @xmath65 their coefficients at @xmath66 are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the operator basis now consists of 10 operators @xmath67 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian appears just below the w - scale as @xmath68    if the qcd corrections from @xmath1 to @xmath2 are ignored [ by setting @xmath69 in eqn.([c2 ] ) ] , the above results([c2 ] ) would reduce to the previous results @xcite exactly , where the top quark and w bosons are integrated out together .",
    "this is a necessary consistent check .",
    "the running of the coefficients of operators from @xmath52 to @xmath70 was well described in previous papers@xcite . after running we have the coefficients of operators at @xmath70 scale @xcite .",
    "@xmath71 with @xmath72 , @xmath73,@xmath74 and @xmath75 defined in ref.@xcite .",
    "in a spectator model , the inclusive decay @xmath76 is mainly contributed from the b quark decay @xmath77 . to leading order , the differential decay rate @xmath78 , where @xmath79 , is given by : @xmath80.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath81 where @xmath82 arises from the one - loop matrix element of the four- quark operators , which can be written as @xcite @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "the factor of @xmath85 arises because of the dependence of the semileptonic decay rate on the nonnegligible ratio @xmath86 , and is given by @xmath87 in eqn.([wid ] ) the masses of the electron and the strange quark were neglected .",
    "the semileptonic decay @xmath88 @xcite is used to eliminate large uncertainties of @xmath89 in the decay width formula .",
    "the dependence on the weak mixing angles also cancels out . if we take experimental result @xmath90 @xcite , the branching ratios of @xmath91 is found .    taking values as @xmath92gev , @xmath93gev , @xmath94gev and the qcd coupling constant @xmath95 @xcite ,",
    "the differential branching ratios are depicted in fig.1 as a function of @xmath96 .",
    "it is shown that the qcd corrections from @xmath97 to @xmath2 slightly suppress the @xmath98 differential decay rate for a large invariant mass of the @xmath5 pair ; while enhance it for a very small invariant mass of the @xmath5 pair .",
    "since the enhancement is larger than the suppression in the invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath5 pair , the total branching ratio is found to be slightly enhanced about 4% comparing with the one without qcd correction from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "as a conclusion , we have given the full leading log qcd corrections ( including qcd running from @xmath1 to @xmath2 ) to @xmath99 decay in the standard model .",
    "the qcd correction from @xmath97 to @xmath2 slightly suppresses the @xmath98 differential decay rate for a large invariant mass of the @xmath5 pair . while the integrated width is slightly enhanced comparing with that without the qcd running from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "although this result is not quite different from the previous calculations , our improvement lies in reducing some theoretical uncertainties .",
