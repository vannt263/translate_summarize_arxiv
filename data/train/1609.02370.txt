    "with the successful operation of the high energy gamma ray detectors it has become possible to study blazar flares even at very high energies .",
    "blazars have relativistic jets directed toward us where the radiation losses from the relativistic electrons and protons result in the emission of photons of radio to gamma ray frequencies .",
    "they are powerful sources of gev - tev gamma rays .",
    "their spectral attenuations at very high energy with cosmological distances are widely used to study the absorption of high energy gamma rays by the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) @xcite .",
    "their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) have two broad peaks .",
    "the peak at low frequency originates from synchrotron radiations of accelerated electrons in the relativistic jet and the peak at higher frequency from the inverse compton scattering of these electrons by the seed photons in the jet , and the external regions including the disc torus , the broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "the high energy hump may also originate from synchrotron emission of accelerated protons in the jet and hadronic interactions , .",
    "hadronic interactions could be between accelerated protons and cold matter or low energy photons .",
    "flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and bl lacs are two different classes of blazars having different spectral features .",
    "fsrqs have bright optical and uv emission lines @xcite , also they are more luminous in high energy photons than bl lacs .",
    "external compton ( ec ) mechanism successfully describes the high energy emission from fsrqs in most cases while synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) emission is the most popular scenario for bl lacs .",
    "pks 1510 - 089 , pks 1222 + 21 , and 3c 279 are the three fsrqs observed in gamma rays of energy more than 100 gev .",
    "the flares from 3c 279 have been modeled earlier with the synchrotron emission from accelerated electrons and protons , also with the two zone ssc model @xcite .",
    "pks 1510 - 089 is a fsrq located at a redshift of 0.361 with highly polarised radio and optical emission .",
    "although many fsrqs have been found to have a spectral break in the frequency range of a few gev @xcite , the sed of pks 1510 - 089 shows no such distinctive feature .",
    "in fact the transition from the high energy ( he:100 mev to 100 gev ) to vhe range is quite smooth for the observed data .",
    "it has a black hole of mass @xmath1 estimated from its accretion disc temperature and uv flux @xcite .",
    "fermi lat and agile detectors have detected highly variable gamma ray emission from it .",
    "detection of gamma rays of energy 300400 gev have been reported by the h.e.s.s .",
    "collaboration @xcite during march - april , 2009 and the magic collaboration from february 3 to april 3 , 2012 .",
    "the quasi - simultaneous data from radio , optical , x - ray and gamma ray telescopes have been combined and modeled with ec mechanism by @xcite .",
    "they showed that the h.e.s.s .",
    "data @xcite could be included in their single zone model if ec emission happens due to the seed photons in the blr and the dusty torus of pks 1510 - 089 .",
    "they also included the effect of the internal absorption of the gamma rays due to pair production with the photons in the blazar environment .",
    "their model is primarily based on the assumption that the emission region is located near the central core i.e. , the near dissipation zone scenario @xcite .",
    "moreover , the absorption of the gamma rays by the ebl further attenuates the gamma ray spectrum before detection .    however according to the findings of @xcite it is possible that the emission region is located at large distances ( tens of parsecs ) from the blazar core",
    "this would mean that the blr cloud and the ir dusty torus can no longer act as possible sources of seed photons . in order to overcome this complication",
    "it has been hypothesized that the jet may have components moving with different relative velocities which provide the necessary seed photons for ic scattering .",
    "have considered both the far and near dissipation zone scenarios while modeling the sed obtained from observations . for the near dissipation zone scenario",
    "the ir torus was considered as the source of seed photons .",
    "whereas for the far dissipation zone scenario they have considered a slow moving sheath enveloping the faster moving spine of the jet as the source of seed photons .",
    "pks 1510 - 089 was detected to be in states of high activity by the hess and magic stereoscopic systems in 2009 and 2012 . in our work",
    "we use a single zone lepto - hadronic model to explain the multi - wavelength data during these flares .",
    "the lower energy peak is attributed to electron synchrotron mechanism whereas we consider the proton synchrotron mechanism for explaining the higher energy peak . unlike the previous models we do not need to consider external sources of photons to explain the observed spectra .",
    "the following sections describe our work in detail .",
    "we have modeled the multi - wavelength data presented in @xcite and [ observation timeline :  march ",
    "april(2009 ) @xmath2 february ",
    "april(2012 ) respectively ] . the observational data in both the cases show pks 1510 - 089 to be active in the vhe regime .",
    "the code used by us to generate the spectra from synchrotron mechanism is from @xcite . while fitting the data we have used the broken power law spectrum for the shock accelerated relativistic electrons and protons , @xmath3    the spectral indices @xmath4 and @xmath5 are chosen to best describe the observed data . to model the higher energy bump in the sed , we consider a relativistic proton population with maximum energy @xmath6 ev . the value of the break energies are not only chosen so that they best describe the observations but also so that the synchrotron cooling time of the electrons is greater than the flaring period(@xmath7 ) and the light travel time @xmath8 through our emission zone .",
    "the magnitude of the ambient magnetic field is also constrained by this condition and we find that a value of 0.22 gauss is required to model the data satisfactorily while maintaining all the constraints . any departure from this value on the higher side compromises with the radio frequency data whereas if we go below this value the jet power increases . in our model",
    "the jet luminosity is minimized as much as possible by suitable choice of the particle energy densities in the emission zone .",
    "the parameters such as redshift ( z = 0.361 for pks 1510 - 089 ) , bulk lorentz factor(@xmath9 ) , viewing angle(@xmath10 ) are dependent on direct observations .",
    "although we can not measure @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the same way we can ascertain the redshift , the observed apparent velocity ( @xmath11 20__c__45__c _ _ ) of the relativistic jet @xcite does indicate a very small viewing angle ( @xmath111.4 3 ) @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite which in turn constrains the value of the lorentz factor according to the relation @xmath12 . due to the extremely high apparent superluminal motion displayed by the jet the value of the doppler factor @xmath13 should also be very high .",
    "we have selected @xmath14= 36.039 by appropriately adjusting the values of @xmath10 @xmath2 @xmath9 while fitting the observed data in our primary model which describes the best fit for all the datapoints from radio to vhe @xmath15ray frequency range .    the radius of the emission region is generally constrained by the flux variability of the source according to the relation @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the observed variability timescale . as no significant variability was detected during the vhe emissions , either by h.e.s.s . or magic we can not infer any strong upper limit on the radius .",
    "however in the he @xmath15-ray regime agile - grid has registered 7 days and 14 days for two distinctive flares , flare - i and flare - ii respectively in 2012 . also , the he data shows variability in shorter time scale which may originate from fluctuations in magnetic field and particle density within a smaller region . for @xmath18 ,",
    "the radius of the emission region for the agile - grid observations should be @xmath19 and @xmath20 cms for flare - i and ii respectively .",
    "the variability in the radio frequency range was also in the timescale of weeks during that observing period . during the observations in 2009",
    "@xcite two distinct flares were detected by _",
    "fermi_-lat within a duration of 42 days .",
    "it is important to mention in this context that the above relation is an approximate one and might lead to large errors while estimating the dimensions of the emitting region @xcite . thus considering all the factors discussed above we have assumed the value of _ r _ as @xmath21 cm for our emission region .    as the vhe @xmath15-rays are subjected to absorption by the extra - galactic background light(ebl ) we have included the necessary correction to the @xmath15-ray spectrum following the model of @xcite .",
    "the seds fitted by us are given in the next section along with the tables(table[table1 ] @xmath2 table[table2 ] ) describing the specific values of the parameters .",
    "[ table1 ]        [ table2 ]",
    "the spectral energy distribution of pks 1510 - 089 during the epochs [ march  april(2009 ) ; february  april(2012 ) ] when it was active in the vhe regime is modeled using a single zone lepto - hadronic model .",
    "the size of the emission region assumed in our model is _ _ r__=5.7@xmath22 cm and magnetic field _ _ b__=0.22 gauss .",
    "the lower energy sed peak of the two epochs is explained by synchrotron radiation from shock accelerated electrons assuming they exist in the energy range 9.55@xmath238.91@xmath24 ev @xmath2 @xmath256.31@xmath24 ev respectively .",
    "the break energies of the electrons in the two observation epochs are 1.86@xmath26 ev @xmath2 1.26@xmath26 ev respectively for fitting the radio to optical - uv frequency data .",
    "the observed data in the x - ray to vhe @xmath15-ray frequency range makes up the second energy bump in the sed of pks 1510 - 089 .",
    "our results indicate that a population of shock accelerated protons in the energy ranges 3.16@xmath273.55@xmath28 ev [ sed2009 ] @xmath2 3.98@xmath277.41@xmath28 ev [ sed2012 ] can reproduce the second peak in the spectra quite accurately .",
    "the required break energies for the same proton populations to efficiently model the data were 2.82@xmath29 ev and 1.78@xmath29 ev respectively .",
    "the multiwavelength sed fits according to our model for the 2009 flaring episode can be found in figure[figure1 ] and that of the 2012 period can be found in figure[figure2 ] .",
    "all the model parameters of our lepto - hadronic framework are tabulated in table[table1 ] and table[table2 ] . from the figures we can clearly see that a single - zone lepto - hadronic model provides a good description of the overall broadband spectrum for a realistic parameter set , atleast during the flaring states of the source .",
    "for the highest flaring period during he @xmath15-ray emissions(flare - ii reported by agile - grid in 2012 ) we have @xmath17 = 14 days ( or @xmath30 = @xmath31 = 1.21@xmath32 hrs ) .",
    "the exact values of the timescales for both electrons and protons are tabulated below in table[table3 ] .",
    "all the values are calculated in the rest frame of the emission region .    * timescale comparisons *    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     * model parameters and other relevant values for figure3 *    [ table4 ]",
    "our results suggest that the lepto - hadronic mechanism can successfully explain the high state activity of pks 1510 - 089 without having to assume the existence of multiple emission regions as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the best possible description of the obsevations was achieved for @xmath14=36.039 at a departure from the equipartition condition at the expense of a comparatively higher jet power .",
    "although the jet power in all our models is of the order @xmath33 ergs / sec , such high luminosities might be attained during blazar flares [ see @xcite @xmath2 @xcite ] .",
    "earlier studies also indicated the need of such high luminosities in hadronic model .",
    "the dimension of the emission region in our model is consistent with the observed week scale variability in the he and radio frequency range .",
    "the hour scale variability reported by @xcite and @xcite could be possible for higher magnetic field in the emission region .",
    "fluctuations in magnetic field and particle density may be the cause of rapid variability or  flickering \" .",
