    "hot molecular cores are compact , dense cores of gas which display a rich array of chemical species and are frequently found in association with ultracompact hii  regions ( e.g.  kurtz et al .",
    "temperatures in the region of 100300 k have been derived from ammonia and methyl cyanide observations ( cesaroni et al .",
    "1994 , olmi et al .",
    "in addition to the high temperature a striking feature of hot cores is the elevated abundance of saturated molecules and rare species compared with dark clouds such as tmc-1 , which chemical models show can only arise if chemical reactions on grain surfaces are included ( brown , millar & charnley 1988 ) .",
    "however , it has been unclear as to whether all hot cores marked the actual sites of massive star formation or if some were remnant clumps heated by nearby ob stars ( e.g.  watt & mundy 1999 ) .",
    "many studies have been made of hot cores , and observations with interferometers have begun to reveal the geometry of the gas and dust in these regions ( blake et al .",
    "1996 ; wright , plambeck & wilner 1996 ) .",
    "small - scale velocity gradients have been inferred from methyl cyanide observations ( olmi et al .",
    "1996 ) but thus far the interpretation is ambiguous .",
    "subarcsecond observations of the ( 4,4 ) inversion transition of ammonia by cesaroni et al .",
    "( 1998 , hereafter c98 ) represent the highest resolution molecular - line images published to date , resolving the hot cores in g10.47 + 0.03 , g29.96@xmath30.02 and g31.41 + 0.31 .",
    "c98 also observed temperature and velocity gradients in these three sources and concluded that the hot cores probably encompass rotating flattened structures , perhaps disks .",
    "further evidence for the presence of embedded sources within hot cores came from testi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) who discovered a faint 3.5-cm radio continuum source within g9.62f , while hofner , wiesemeyer & henning ( 2001 ) detected hco@xmath7 line wing emission with a spatially bipolar distribution , interpreted as a molecular outflow , in the same hot core .",
    "beltrn et al .",
    "( 2004 ) detected a velocity gradient in g31.41 + 0.31 which they interpreted as rotation about a central source driving a bipolar flow ( seen in @xmath8co : olmi et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in order to shed further light on the nature of hot cores",
    ", we have begun a high - resolution study with the berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) millimeter array of a sample of four hot core sources : g9.62 + 0.19 , g10.47 + 0.03 , g29.96@xmath30.02 and g31.41 + 0.31 ( hereafter g9.62 , g10.47 , g29.96 and g31.41 respectively ) . in this paper",
    "we present observations of the h@xmath0s 2(2,0)@xmath12(1,1 ) and c@xmath2o  2@xmath11 lines in order to explore the kinematics of the gas associated with the hot cores . in a companion paper , wyrowski , gibb & mundy ( 2004 , hereafter paper ii ) present observations and modeling of the continuum emission at 2.7 and 1.4 mm with sub - arcsecond resolution of these objects .",
    "they find that in all cases but g10.47 the millimeter emission is clearly offset from the free - free emission seen at centimeter wavelengths and that the strong 1.4-mm continuum emission is evidence that these hot cores are massive , dense cores .",
    "h@xmath0s  is one such saturated species mentioned above , only forming on dust grains or by hydrogenation reactions in hot shocked gas ( e.g.charnley 1997 )",
    ". models of the gas - phase chemistry involving h@xmath0spredict that over a period of @xmath410@xmath9 yr h@xmath0s  reacts with oxygen - bearing species to form the daughter products so and so@xmath0 , causing the gas - phase abundance of h@xmath0s  to decline from @xmath10 to @xmath11 or lower ( e.g. rodgers & charnley 2003 ; wakelam et al .",
    "thus its distribution will trace the regions where dust grains have been recently subject to sufficient heating to evaporate material from the grain mantles ( hatchell , roberts & millar 1999 ) , either thermally by the radiation from nearby ob stars or non - thermally through the action of shocks in an outflow .",
    "the gas phase abundance of h@xmath0s  is not well known , with a number of studies giving values in the range @xmath12 to @xmath5 ( van der tak et al .",
    "2003 ; minh et al .",
    "h@xmath0s  has been observed in the outflow associated with the orion hot core by minh et al .",
    "( 1990 ) who derive abundances as high as a few times @xmath13 relative to h@xmath0 .",
    "as we show below , we detect high - velocity h@xmath0s  emission which also originates in outflows from sources embedded within the hot cores .",
    "the bima array ( welch et al .  1996 ) was used in a ( except g9.62 ) , b , c and d configurations on various dates between 1999 may and 2001 february .",
    "nine antennas of the array were employed , tuned to a lower - sideband frequency of 216.7 ghz ( corresponding to a wavelength of 1.4 mm ) . the intermediate frequency of 1.5 ghz places the upper sideband at 219.7 ghz .",
    "the correlator setup included one spectral window tuned to the frequency of the h@xmath0s  2(2,0)@xmath12(1,1 ) at 216.7104 ghz with c@xmath2o  2@xmath11 at 219.5603 ghz falling in the upper sideband .",
    "the observing bandwidth was 50 mhz , with a spectral resolution of 781 khz ( corresponding to 68.7 and 1.07 kms@xmath14respectively ) .",
    "antenna gains were checked with observations of planets and found to be accurate within 20 per cent .",
    "phase calibration involved observation of the quasars 1733@xmath3130 , 1743@xmath3038 and 1751@xmath15096 for 34 minutes",
    "every 1530 minutes ( depending on array configuration ) .",
    "observations made in the a configuration ( as well as the b configuration for g9.62 and g29.96 ) also utilized fast switching between source and calibrator every 1.52.5 minutes to track the phases ( see looney , mundy , & welch 2000 for further details ) .",
    "the continuum emission was subtracted from the visibility data using channels free from line emission .",
    "the continuum emission from each source at 1.4 mm is strong enough to permit self - calibration . the upper and lower sidebands were self - calibrated separately and the solutions applied to the respective line data .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the miriad package ( sault et al .",
    ". a briggs robust parameter of between 0 and 2 was used for image construction and analysis . for the purposes of presenting the data , the highest resolution with good signal - to - noise has been used ( with a robust value of typically 0.250.5 ) .",
    "table [ sources ] lists the relevant source details , including the resolution of the images presented .",
    "flux densities in jy may be converted to brightness temperatures in k assuming the following conversion factors for c@xmath2oand h@xmath0s  respectively  2.5 & 3.4 ( g9.62 ) , 3.7 & 7.3 ( g10.47 ) , 3.9 & 4.3 ( g29.96 ) and 6.4 & 9.4 ( g31.41 ) .",
    "in this section we describe the main observational results , place them in context with previous observations and present the analysis alongside .",
    "c@xmath2o  and h@xmath0s  spectra for each source are shown in figure [ spectra ] , clearly showing the high - velocity wings in the h@xmath0sspectra toward three of the four target regions .",

    "each source will now be described in more detail .",
    "the region around g9.62 + 0.19 is known to have nearly a dozen hiiregions ( cesaroni et al .",
    "1994 ; testi et al .",
    "2000 ) , many of which are compact or ultracompact .",
    "components d  g appear to lie within an elongated core , traced by ch@xmath16cn and continuum emission at 2.7 and 1.4 mm ( hofner et al .",
    "1996 ; paper ii ) .",
    "the brightest dust emission at 1.4 mm coincides with the centimeter source g9.62f , with a secondary maximum toward g9.62e .",
    "testi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) show that the centimeter fluxes of g9.62f are consistent with an embedded b1b1.5 star either exciting an ultracompact hii  region or driving an ionized stellar wind .",
    "the c@xmath2o  2@xmath11 emission towards g9.62 defines a single elongated core encompassing components f and d ( figure [ g962]a ) .",
    "component e lies towards the edge of the integrated emission but does not stand out as a separate core .",
    "the emission shows a number of weaker extensions which do not appear to be associated with any of the known hii  regions .",
    "the overall distribution closely follows that of the c@xmath2o  1@xmath10 emission shown by hofner et al .",
    "channel maps ( figure [ g962chans]a ) reveal what may be the limb of a shell of gas defining the interface between the extended hii  region b and the molecular cloud .",
    "a velocity gradient exists from north to south ( blue to red ) as seen previously by hofner et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in their 1@xmath10 data .",
    "the c@xmath2o  spectra show self - absorption dips toward the center of the core . comparing the total flux with the single - dish measurements of hatchell et al .",
    "( 1998b ) show that our observations recover all of the c@xmath2o  emission to within the calibration uncertainties .",
    "therefore , it is likely that these dips are genuine and not a result of missing flux in the map .",
    "the presence of the self - absorption makes it difficult to reliably estimate linewidths , but away from the core center the typical linewidth is @xmath44.0 kms@xmath14 .",
    "there appears to be a weak red wing on the c@xmath2o  spectrum toward component f , as also observed by hofner et al .",
    "however , a map of the blue and redshifted emission does not show clear evidence for an outflow .",
    "the total integrated h@xmath0s  emission in g9.62 also defines an elongated core ( see figure [ g962]b ) , but it is clear that the denser gas traced by h@xmath0s  is concentrated toward components e and f with two clear maxima seen toward these sources .",
    "the emission also extends to cover components d and g but it is not possible to distinguish separate cores .",
    "the h@xmath0s  emission peaks coincide with the 1.4-mm continuum sources presented in paper ii .",
    "no h@xmath0s  emission is detected toward components b , c , h or i. no emission was detected toward the extended near - infrared feature discovered by persi et al.(2003 ) .",
    "the h@xmath0s  lines tend to be broader than the c@xmath2o  lines , indicating their formation in more turbulent regions closer to the center of the core , and are broadest at the position of component f with a full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 6.8 kms@xmath14 .",
    "the fwhm linewidth at e is 3.1 kms@xmath14 , 5.2 kms@xmath14  at g and 3.8 kms@xmath14  toward component d. the spectrum toward f shows both blue and redshifted wing emission , and a map of the blue - shifted emission between @xmath36 and 0 kms@xmath14  reveals a well - defined lobe of emission slightly displaced from the center of core f. the redshifted gas ( integrated between 8 and 13 kms@xmath14 ) defines a counterpart to the blue lobe , and is centered on component f : see figure [ g962]c .",
    "most of the h@xmath0o masers near g9.62f are redshifted , suggesting that they arise in the outflow .",
    "the outflow lobes do not show the same position angle nor do they peak at the same position as those seen in the hco@xmath7 data of hofner et al .",
    "( 2001 ) but they are in the same sense : blueshifted gas to the sw , redshifted to the ne . the h@xmath0s  results therefore reinforce the interpretation that f is the hot core source and that it contains a young high - mass protostellar object .    like the c@xmath2o",
    ", the h@xmath0s  data also delineate a clear velocity gradient along the major axis of the core , also seen previously by hofner et al .",
    "1996 ) , shown in a grayscale representation in figure [ g962]b ( although not so obvious from the channel maps in figure [ g962chans]b ) .",
    "the h@xmath0s  outflow emerges at an angle to the long axis of the core .",
    "the position angle of the outflow is 10.5 degrees east of north ; that of the core is @xmath313 degrees .",
    "( the position angle of the hco@xmath7 outflow is 28 degrees . )",
    "the orientation of the blue and red lobes of the outflow defines a velocity gradient which is in the _ opposite _ sense to that seen along the major axis of the core , i.e.  redshifted in the south and blueshifted to the north and west , further supporting our interpretation that the line wings arise in a bipolar outflow driven by an embedded source within f. hofner et al .",
    "( 2001 ) present arguments for the outflow being viewed pole - on . in this geometry",
    "it is unlikely that significant rotation can be detected .",
    "an alternative ( and perhaps more likely ) possibility is that the velocity gradient is due to the superposition of three cores ( housing components d , f and g ) which lie at different velocities .",
    "higher angular resolution would enable this hypothesis to be tested .    while g9.62e is clearly detected in h@xmath0s  emission , no line wings",
    "are observed which implies that either it has yet to form an outflow or it has evolved beyond the outflow stage .",
    "given its well - defined hiiregion ( stronger than f ) and weaker dust emission than component f , it is likely that g9.62e is more evolved than g9.62f and has begun to clear away its parent core .",
    "g10.47 + 0.03 houses a group of four ultracompact hii  regions , three of which ( a , b1 and b2 ) lie within a region 2 arcsec across ( c98 ) .",
    "c98 argue that the majority of the nh@xmath16 ( 4,4 ) emission originates behind the three hii  regions , with component a being the least embedded .",
    "the ammonia peaks approximately 0.5 arcsec east of b1 .",
    "the fourth hii  region , g10.47c , lies outside the area of ammonia emission . in this interpretation , the radio continuum sources",
    "are not deeply embedded within the hot core , instead lying close to the front surface .",
    "the c@xmath2o  emission ( figure [ g1047]a ) defines a single compact core peaking on the hii  regions b1 and b2 , with an extension to the west .",
    "no emission is detected toward component c. a number of features including the westward extension show up more clearly in the channel maps ( figure [ g1047chans]a ) .",
    "the westward extension covers the velocity range 61.5 to 64.5 kms@xmath14  ( curving further north at 64.5 kms@xmath14 ) , while between 64.5 and 69 kms@xmath14  a corresponding feature exists in the south - east to east , with a well - defined tongue of emission extending to the east at 69 kms@xmath14 .",
    "such features could represent a bipolar outflow , or a rotating ( fragmented ) core .",
    "we rule out outflow since the spectra to the east and west of center peak at different velocities , and thus the east and west extensions are not due to high - velocity line wings .",
    "therefore it seems likely that these features define a gradient in the bulk of the core , and may represent smaller and less - massive individual cores .",
    "the c@xmath2o  spectra are single peaked across the entire region , and broadest at the position of the hot core .",
    "the linewidths at the positions of the east and west components are much narrower than toward the hot core ( @xmath43 kms@xmath14 ) . comparing our data with those of hatchell et al",
    "( 1998b ) again shows that we detect all of the c@xmath2oflux to within the calibration uncertainties .",
    "the h@xmath0s  line is only detected in emission towards g10.47 and we do not see the same bow - shape seen in the ammonia of c98 caused by absorption against the hii  regions .",
    "the integrated h@xmath0s  emission ( figure [ g1047]b ) shows a single - peaked core elongated in a nw - se direction at the lowest contours , but twists to a ne - sw direction in the highest contours , encompassing the uchii  regions , b1 and b2 .",
    "this suggests that there are two separate cores containing b1 and b2 which we are unable to resolve . like c98",
    ", we also do not detect any molecular line emission toward g10.47c .",
    "the brightest emission lies slightly south of b1/2 , and extends further south by @xmath42 arcsec , consistent with elongation in dust continuum ( paper ii ) .",
    "the spectra toward each of the hii  regions are flat - topped which could be due to either the presence of two velocity components which we are unable to resolve ( perhaps from an expanding shell ) or high optical depths in the h@xmath0s  line . in our discussion below ( section [ columns ] )",
    "we conclude that the h@xmath0s  is most likely to be optically thick .",
    "the h@xmath0s  covers a velocity range from 58 to 74 kms@xmath14 a similar range to the c@xmath2o . unlike the other sources in this sample",
    ", the h@xmath0s  line does not show the same clear high - velocity wings ( figure [ spectra ] ) .",
    "however , the h@xmath0s  lines toward g10.47 are the broadest in our survey with a peak fwhm of 10.5 kms@xmath14 . from channel maps it is possible to distinguish two velocity components , although these do not correspond to any of the kinematic features of the c@xmath2odata .",
    "the first component extends in the ne ",
    "sw direction and covers the range 61 kms@xmath14  to 73 kms@xmath14 .",
    "a second component extends nw ",
    "se which traces material between 59 and 70 kms@xmath14 .",
    "the ne - sw velocity component is also seen in nh@xmath16 ( 4,4 ) of c98 .",
    "a secondary peak is observed at ( 3,@xmath37 ) arcsec offset over the velocity range 65 to 67 kms@xmath14 , coincident with one of the c@xmath2o  cores desrcibed above .",
    "while the h@xmath0s  spectra do not show clear high - velocity line wings , the extreme red and blue shifted emission does show a slight north - south separation , although it is less than one beam diameter ( figure [ g1047]c ) .",
    "the center of this ` outflow ' lies @xmath17 north of the the 1.4-mm continuum peak and the uchii  regions b1 and b2 .",
    "the fact that all the water masers are aligned on a north - south axis lends support to an outflow interpretation .",
    "the outflow interpretation gains further support from the fact that olmi et al.(1996 ) detected a velocity gradient in @xmath8co  consistent with a north - south outflow ( in the same sense as we observe in h@xmath0s ) , as well as an east - west velocity gradient in ch@xmath16cn , i.e.  perpendicular to the proposed outflow ( although see   [ ch3cn ] below ) .",
    "the small offset between the lobes means that we have not resolved a flow direction , or that there is no outflow and we are be seeing the front and back surfaces of an expanding shell of gas centered on the hiiregions .",
    "we therefore conclude that there is only weak evidence for either outflow or rotation toward g10.47 .",
    "the ultracompact hii  region in g29.96@xmath30.02 shows a classic cometary shape ( wood & churchwell 1989 ) , which is also evident in our 2.7 and 1.4-mm continuum data ( paper ii ) .",
    "c98 also observed g29.96 in ammonia ( 4,4 ) and detected a single peak coincident with a group of water masers , but offset from the hii  region .",
    "dust emission peaks at the position of the ammonia and water masers ( olmi et al .  2003 ; paper ii ) confirming the location of the hot core .",
    "the c@xmath2o  emission toward g29.96 defines an extended core with multiple peaks ( figure [ g2996]a ) .",
    "there is general good agreement with the 1@xmath10 data of olmi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , although they do not detect the westward ridge we see in our data .",
    "the c@xmath2o  emission shows a well - defined edge extending from north - east to south - west , which is likely associated with the boundary between the molecular cloud and the ultracompact hii  region .",
    "this is seen more clearly in the channel maps , figure [ g2996chans]a .",
    "this fact indicates that the hot core and the ultracompact hii  region are embedded within the same molecular cloud .",
    "the lone water maser @xmath44.5@xmath18 to the sw does not appear to be associated with any other peaks in either the c@xmath2o  or h@xmath0s  emission .",
    "the c@xmath2o  emission peaks on the hot core , decreasing in intensity to the west , where at least two further cores can be discerned .",
    "these cores have not been resolved by any previous observations .",
    "there is a very slight velocity gradient along this ridge with the more distant core being marginally blue - shifted relative to the hot core ( spectra peak at 96.8 , 96.5 and 96.1 kms@xmath14  from east to west ) .",
    "the c@xmath2o  lines are relatively narrow across much of the source , peaking at the hot core position .",
    "g29.96 has the smallest range of c@xmath2o  emission of our sample of sources , covering only 5 kms@xmath14(figure [ g2996chans]a ) .",
    "the linewidths decrease along the westward ridge away from the hot core ( 4.0 , 3.5 and 3.2 kms@xmath14  for the hot core , w1 and w2 respectively ) .",
    "once again , there is good agreement between our c@xmath2o  flux and the single - dish measurement of hatchell et al .",
    "( 1998b ) .",
    "the integrated h@xmath0s  emission shows a single maximum coincident with 1.4-mm continuum peak ( figure [ g2996]b ) .",
    "channel maps show that the h@xmath0s  is extended over a region @xmath19 in diameter and appears to wrap around the head of the uchii region ( figure [ g2996chans]b ) , in a similar manner to the c@xmath2o .",
    "the h@xmath0semission in g29.96 is the most extensive of all our four sources , and shows extensions to the west and south - west which may be further individual cores .",
    "the h@xmath0s  spectra ( figure [ spectra ] ) show strong line wings extending to @xmath2010 kms@xmath14  across a wide area .",
    "redshifted wings are seen in the south - east while blue - shifted wings extend to the north - west .",
    "figure [ g2996]c shows the integrated red and blueshifted emission and clearly shows the spatial bipolarity of an outflow .",
    "the outflow center appears to lie closer to the ammonia peak of c98 than our 1.4-mm peak .",
    "this may indicate that there are multiple sources within the g29.96 hot core : higher resolution observations are clearly needed .",
    "the orientation of the blue lobe is along line of methanol masers seen by minier , booth & conway ( 2002 ) .",
    "the methanol masers are also blueshifted , increasingly blueshifted with distance from the outflow center .",
    "figure [ g2996]b also shows an image of the first moment of the h@xmath0s  emission ( clipped at a level which excludes the wing emission ) , revealing a velocity gradient along a sw to ne axis , blue - shifted in the sw and redshifted toward the ne .",
    "there is evidence of this same gradient in the c@xmath2odata as well .",
    "figure [ g2996chans]a shows that the c@xmath2o  peaks to the sw of the hot core at 95.5 kms@xmath14  and to the ne at 97.7 kms@xmath14 .",
    "it is tempting to interpret this as rotation of the hot core , especially since the gradient is observed to be perpendicular to the outflow direction .",
    "however we regard this conclusion as somewhat tentative and clearly requires further observations of high - density tracers which are not contaminated by outflow . under the assumption that we are detecting rotation",
    "the velocity gradient is @xmath411 kms@xmath14 pc@xmath14 , corresponding to a rotation period of @xmath21 yr .",
    "the region associated with g31.41 + 0.31 houses an ultracompact hiiregion along with a diffuse shell of extended radio continuum emission ( wood & churchwell 1989 ) .",
    "hofner & churchwell ( 1996 ) detect a group of 8 water masers , none of which coincide with the uchiiregion .",
    "however , the ammonia observations of c98 reveal a compact core of molecular gas clearly coincident with the water masers , but with no associated centimeter continuum emission .",
    "our c@xmath2o  emission shown in figure [ g3141]a defines an elongated core , mostly oriented north - south but with a clear contribution from a diffuse , more extended component oriented ne - sw .",
    "most notable is the fact that the c@xmath2o  does not peak at the hot core position ; in fact the hot core is seen as a local minimum in the c@xmath2o  emission .",
    "a comparison of our data and the jcmt measurement of hatchell et al.(1998b ) shows that we only detect of order 70% of the c@xmath2o  flux .",
    "it may be that the c@xmath2o  is not strongly peaked on the hot core position and is thus filtered out by our interferometric observations .",
    "alternatively , the brightness temperature of the continuum emission may be sufficiently high ( at 27.5 k for the naturally - weighted data ) that the c@xmath2o  is simply not detectable above this level .",
    "there are a number of peaks evident in the integrated map , although it is not certain if they represent independent cores given that some of the flux is missing from the image .",
    "channel maps reveal the structure of the core .",
    "figure [ g3141]a shows the presence of a clear velocity gradient along the major axis of the c@xmath2o  core , blue - shifted in the south and red - shifted to the north .",
    "the individual peaks seen in the integrated intensity map are clearly seen in the channel maps .",
    "figure [ g3141]b shows that the integrated h@xmath0s  emission is centered on the 1.4-mm and ammonia emission , with the water masers mostly lying along an axis parallel with the observed extension of the h@xmath0s  core .",
    "the first moment image also shown in figure [ g3141]b shows a weak velocity gradient along the core ( in the same sense as the larger - scale c@xmath2o  gradient ) , which is tempting to interpret as rotation .",
    "the high - velocity wing emission ( shown in figure [ g3141]c ) is predominantly east - west in orientation .",
    "a position - velocity cut along the core shows the velocity gradient more clearly ( see   [ dynamics ] below ) .",
    "we need further observations of complementary tracers to isolate one velocity component from the other .",
    "we note that the lower - resolution hco@xmath7 1@xmath10 and sio 2@xmath11 observations of maxia et al .",
    "( 2001 ) show the same distribution of red- and blueshifted high - velocity gas , supporting the outflow interpretation .",
    "the water masers appear to be associated with the outflow since many of the maser spots are red - shifted .",
    "channel maps ( shown in figure [ g3141chans]b ) show that the h@xmath0semission is largely extended in the same ne - sw direction at all blue - shifted velocities . at the south end of the core ,",
    "two secondary peaks show up at 91 to 93 kms@xmath14 , and it may be these components which bias the first moment image toward greater blue - shifted velocities in this regions",

    "the h@xmath0s  virial masses for both component g9.62e and g9.62f are in good agreement with the masses derived from c@xmath2o  by hofner et al.(1996 ) , and our c@xmath2o  virial mass agrees well with their total mass for e and f. since we measure a larger linewidth for our h@xmath0s  data ( 7.8 kms@xmath14  compared with 4.4 kms@xmath14  for ammonia ) , our estimate of the virial mass for f is correspondingly higher than the cesaroni et al.(1994 ) value although the sizes are in good agreement .",

    "it appears that for all our sources several solar masses of material has been swept up , typically @xmath44 m@xmath6 in each lobe . since we have neglected emission close to the line center , the true mass of each outflow is probably higher .",
    "even so , given the mass estimates in table [ outflow ] , it is clear that these outflows are being driven by massive protostars since they compare favorably with a number of measurements of larger , more well - developed flows from massive ysos ( e.g.  gibb et al .",

    "shepherd & churchwell 1996 ) , although the choice of h@xmath0s  abundance clearly affects our final numbers .",
    "however , we wish to point out that since we are not sensitive to the highest - velocity gas ( the velocity extent is quite low ) the momentum and energy for each outflow will be seriously underestimated .",
    "co observations are desirable in order to better constrain the flow energetics .",
    "h@xmath0s  has only been previously observed in single - dish observations of these sources . since we are able to resolve the structure of the h@xmath0semission we can now discuss our observations in the context of physical and chemical models of hot cores .",

    "( 1998a ) estimate the h@xmath0s  column density toward all four of our target sources from single - dish observations of the same transition ( and assuming the same excitation conditions ) as we present here .",
    "these single - dish column densities are typically a factor of 20 lower than the column densities we derive , due to the brightness temperature being diluted by the 22-arcsec jcmt beam .",
    "thus the filling factor for the jcmt observations is @xmath41/20 , which predicts a source size of order 5 , very similar to what we observe ( table [ hparameters ] ) .    in the absence of any other input , chemical models of hot cores start with a gas - phase h@xmath0s  abundance of around @xmath5 based on the observations of minh et al .  ( 1991 ) , and more recently on the iso results which place an upper limit of @xmath5 on the solid h@xmath0sabundance ( van dishoeck & blake 1996 ) . for example , rodgers & charnley ( 2003 ) follow the evolution of chemical abundances in centrally - heated cores assuming two different models for the evolution of the physical parameters of the core .",
    "rodgers & charnley suggest that their static model is more appropriate for massive cores , and show that the abundance of h@xmath0s  is initially high and decreases rapidly with time . at early times ( @xmath52 yr ) h@xmath0s  appears to have a uniform abundance across the core , falling off at an outer radius which increases with time , reaching 0.01 pc at @xmath53 yr ( the outer radius of their model is 0.03 pc ) .",
    "the typical abundance for h@xmath0s  in these models is a few @xmath54 to @xmath5 , falling off rapidly with radius at late times ( although it rises again in the outer regions of the core ) .",
    "inspection of their predicted column densities shows that only at late times ( at @xmath55 yr and beyond ) does the h@xmath0s  column density fall below @xmath56 @xmath25 .",
    "simultaneously , the size of the hot core in ammonia is at least a factor of two smaller , purely as a result of the chemistry .",

    "we note that the hot core models predict h@xmath0s  abundances at least an order of magnitude greater than the values we calculate ( table [ hparameters ] ) . as discussed elsewhere in this paper",
    ", it is likely that a combination of high optical depth and an overestimated mass from the virial theorem can account for this discrepancy . since ammonia is well studied on similar scales in hot cores , we can examine the nh@xmath16/h@xmath0s  abundance ratio . using the ammonia column densities given by cesaroni et al .",
    "( 1994 ) we derive ratios [ h@xmath0s / nh@xmath16]=28@xmath58 .",
    "however , in the models of rodgers & charnley ( 2003 ) , this ratio never falls below unity except at late times ( @xmath55 yr ) .",
    "the simplest explanation for the observed ratios is that the h@xmath0s  lines have significant optical depth leading to vastly underestimated h@xmath0s  column densities .",
    "the data we present here appear to trace two kinematic components .",
    "the first is outflow traced by the h@xmath0s .",
    "the second is a velocity gradient more or less perpendicular to the outflow and is probably rotation , seen in both c@xmath2o  and h@xmath0s .",
    "the outflow evidence is clear : spatially bipolar lobes of red- and blueshifted gas .",
    "the rotation interpretation is ambiguous , especially in light of the likely fragmented nature of the g9.62 core and the more obvious outflow signature in the h@xmath0s .",
    "however , given the good agreement between the c@xmath2o  and h@xmath0sgradients across each core , the rotation interpretation seems more tenable . in figures [ g9pv ] to [ g31pv ] we show selected position - velocity ( pv ) cuts across each of the h@xmath0s  data cubes for each of the hot cores ( along the long axis of the core and along the outflow axis where defined ) . in three of the four sources clear velocity gradients",
    "are present . only g10.47 ( figure [ g10pv ] ) does not show a velocity gradient .",
    "the observed velocity gradients tend to be linear along the long axis of the core , although they typically only extend for a couple of beamwidths .",
    "( however , we note that it is possible to distinguish velocity gradients on scales smaller than a beam : e.g. olmi et al .  1996 . )",
    "it is clear that the velocity gradients do not directly show evidence for keplerian rotation ; indeed given the massive cores within which the central stars are embedded such a result would be surprising since a keplerian rotation law only strictly applies for a dominant point mass ( although it may be true that the velocity field is locally keplerian ) .",
    "furthermore , if the observed emission is optically thick ( as concluded above ) then regardless of the intrinsic velocity field , the observed velocity gradient will be linear .",
    "however , even if the emission is not optically thick , our finite beamsize prevents us from directly observing a keplerian rotation curve , instead smoothing out the central region into a linear gradient ( see richer & padman 1991 ) .",
    "therefore , we caution against over - interpreting these pv data , especially since the emission closest to the center is heavily contaminated by the high - velocity emission from the outflow . at best we can only conclude that in the cases of g9.62 , g29.96 and g31.41 our c@xmath2o  and h@xmath0s  data show evidence for velocity gradients along the long axis of the hot core , but not what form the velocity law takes .",
    "if we assume the linear velocity gradients are due to uniform rotation then we can estimate rotation periods , and then the masses required to bind the motions .",
    "for each of the three sources with clear velocity gradients ( g9.62f , g29.96 and g31.41 ) , the rotation periods for each core is similar at 12@xmath59 yr . using the core dimensions shown in table [ hparameters ] these periods require binding masses of only 15 , 60 and 154 m@xmath6 ( for g9.62f , g29.96 and g31.41 respectively ) .",
    "these masses are all less than both the virial and dust - derived masses and so that the cores are rotationally bound , and may even be still collapsing .",
    "the velocity gradients along the outflow axes are larger and imply binding masses of 810 , 2800 and 2360 m@xmath6 respectively , all much larger than the virial masses given in tables [ cparameters ] and [ hparameters ] .",
    "therefore the motions along the outflow axes are not bound to the hot cores .",
    "an interesting feature of the g31.41 pv diagram is that the h@xmath0semission farthest from the center does not lie at the rest velocity .",
    "this indicates that the h@xmath0s  is not very abundant at these distances from the hot core and falls below our detection threshold . from figure [ g31pv ]",
    "we can therefore determine an outer radius of the hot core of @xmath45 arcsec or 0.19 pc ( @xmath60 cm ) .",
    "comparing our results with those of beltrn et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for g31.41 , we find that our outflow direction is closely aligned with the long axis of their methyl cyanide emission , which they interpret as a rotating disk or toroid .",
    "their interpretation was a natural conclusion given the example of iras20126 + 4104 ( cesaroni et al .",
    "1999 ) which shows a clear disk - like component for the ch@xmath16cn emission .",
    "this ambiguity highlights the kind of problems faced when studying hot cores .",
    "however , we believe that our c@xmath2o  and h@xmath0s  data display clear evidence for both outflow and ( in two cases ) velocity gradients perpendicular ( or close to ) to the axis of the outflow . the simplest interpretation for these gradients is rotation of the core .",
    "the distribution of our h@xmath0s  ( and 1.4-mm continuum ) data closely matches that of the nh@xmath16 ( 4,4 ) of c98 .",
    "this leads to the interesting conclusion that beltrn et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have actually detected ch@xmath16cn in the outflow from g31.41 .",
    "further support comes from the ch@xmath16cn observations of g29.96 by olmi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) which are also consistent with emission from an outflow since the velocity gradient is extremely high ( higher than we detect with our h@xmath0s  data , thus requiring an even higher binding mass ) and oriented mostly along the same direction as our outflow .",
    "it is interesting to compare the methyl cyanide and h@xmath0s  results .",
    "h@xmath0s  is clearly not confined to the outflow . on the other hand",
    ", it seems as if the ch@xmath16cn in these sources is dominated by an outflow component , suggesting that it is perhaps shock chemistry that is playing a greater role in the formation of methyl cyanide .",
    "clearly further high - resolution observations are necessary in order to explore this further .",
    "the primary result from these observations is the confirmation that outflows emanate from some hot cores , including all four of the targets in our sample .",
    "furthermore the images of the high - velocity emission show that these outflows appear to be collimated ; in other words , unlike many ultracompact hii  regions , they are not spherical shells driven by the expansion of a symmetric stellar wind .",
    "this has important implications for the formation of massive stars and implies the presence of a collimation mechanism . in the case of low - mass stars",
    ", this is now widely believed to be a rotating circumstellar disk ( ouyed , clarke & pudritz 2003 ; knigl & pudritz 2000 ) .",
    "explanations of outflows from more luminous protostars invoke a wider - angle contribution from a stellar wind ( shepherd et al .",
    "1998 ; richer et al .",
    "2000 ) , although a disk is still believed to play an important role in at least initially collimating the outflow .",
    "clearly we can not determine whether circumstellar disks exist around these outflow sources with the current observations .",
    "however , we can examine whether the ambient medium has sufficient turbulent pressure to act as a collimating agent for the flows . assuming a single driving source we may equate the momentum flux from the wind / outflow ( assumed to be initially isotropic ) with the turbulent back - pressure of the ambient medium : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the ambient density , @xmath63 is the 1-dimensional velocity dispersion ( @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the fwhm ) , @xmath66 is the outflow force and @xmath67 is the radius at which the forces are equal ( the collimation radius ) . using values tabulated in tables [ hparameters ] and [ outflow ] we derive collimation radii of 350 to 950 au . at the distances to our sources ,",
    "these radii correspond to angular scales of 0.06to 0.13 , and are thus unresolvable with current facilities .",
    "if multiple sources contribute to the flow then the expression above can be applied for each source assuming a momentum flux equal to the appropriate fraction of the total .",
    "this will lead to smaller collimation radii and our conclusion is unchanged .",
    "therefore , it seems likely that the ambient medium is playing a significant role in producing the bipolar appearance of the outflows from these hot cores .",
    "the fact that outflows are observed clearly points to a non - spherical geometry .",
    "another implication from our observations is that the outflow must begin at a stage prior to the formation of an ultracompact hiiregion since the hot cores in g29.96 and g31.41 have no radio sources within them .",
    "it could be argued that g10.47 provides evidence counter to this assertion , but we note that c98 conclude the hii  regions in g10.47 are located toward the _ front _ of the hot core , and are therefore not deeply embedded within the hot core itself .",
    "however , g10.47 is our weakest example of an outflow , and the hot core may only be a hot , dense remnant of the formation of the stars exciting the hii  regions , as watt & mundy ( 1999 ) concluded for g34.26 .",
    "unfortunately it is not possible to assess the likelihood of this interpretation with our data and further observations are desirable .",
    "g9.62f has a radio source within it , but it is very weak , and probably represents an ionized stellar wind rather than an hii  region ( testi et al .",
    "the orion hot core is probably excited by the radio source i ( menten & reid 1995 ) , which has a 22-ghz flux density of 4.8 mjy ( plambeck et al .  1995 ) .",
    "if source i were located at a distance typical of the sources in this paper ( @xmath46.5 kpc ) then it would be ( currently ) undetectable at 22 ghz ( the 22-ghz flux density would only be 30 @xmath26jy ) .",
    "equally , bn would also not be detectable .",
    "therefore it is possible that equivalent sources are located within the hot cores studied here .",
    "it should be noted that the centimeter radio emission in both bn and source i is from an ionized stellar wind rather than an ultracompact hii  region .",
    "could it be that there are hii  regions in g29.96 and g31.41 but they are not detectable due to their greater distance ? we can test this by scaling the fluxes of the hii  regions in g10.47 , and using the values given in c98 for the 1.3-cm flux , we find that such hiiregions would be detectable at the distance of g29.96 and g31.41",
    ". therefore the non - detection of hii  regions toward these hot cores suggests that ultracompact hii  regions have not yet formed within them , although stellar wind sources may be present .",
    "since the outflow phenomenon is intimately linked to accretion , our observations are also compatible with the hypothesis that hii  regions can be quenched by a strong accretion flow ( walmsley 1995 ) .",
    "another interesting point to note is that in each case , there appears to be only a single bipolar outflow detected .",
    "( if the observed bipolar outflow is the superposition of multiple flows , then they clearly share a common orientation . )",
    "this is surprising given the clustered nature of massive star formation : it seems more likely that we would not detect an orderly bipolar flow from such a crowded environment .",
    "indeed , even in binary systems the outflow orientations can be distinctly different : the low - mass systems in hh111 and ngc1333-iras2 both show pairs of outflows with very different position angles ( cernicharo & reipurth 1996 ; knee & sandell 2000 ) , while iras16293@xmath32422 exhibits a quadrapolar flow ( walker , carlstrom & bieging 1993 ) .",
    "the observation of a single flow has important implications for the formation of massive stars .",
    "one possiblity is that the most massive and energetic flow ( presumably from the most massive yso ) dominates the energetics , in a similar fashion to how infrared and radio continuum observations are dominated by the most luminous source . alternatively",
    ", the outflow stage could be so short that at any one time , we only catch one source in the act .",
    "an extension of this interpretation is that we have detected these outflows in h@xmath0s , a molecule which is itself comparatively short - lived in hot cores ( charnley 1997 ) .",
    "it is possible that the short outflow lifetime coupled with the short chemical lifetime for h@xmath0s  reinforce each other to produce a single outflow detection .",
    "of course it is highly likely that multiple sources are present within these hot cores , each potentially with its own outflow .",
    "high - resolution observations of co , whose abudance is well - known and stable , are needed to search for multiple outflows .    as always it is instructive to compare these results with the nearest hot core in orion .",
    "the outflow from the orion hot core is well - defined in co ( although the collimation is not very high ; e.g. chernin & wright 1995 ) but has not been probed in h@xmath0s .",
    "the co 4@xmath13 data of schulz et al .",
    "( 1995 ) show a bipolar outflow with outflow lobes separated by @xmath420 .",
    "if such a flow were moved ten to twenty times further away then it is the co flow would only be barely resolvable with current interferometers .",
    "an interesting feature of our g29.96 results is that the 18 @xmath26 m peak of de buizer et al .",
    "( 2002 ) is offset to the nw of the 1.4-mm continuum peak ( figure [ g2996]c ) .",
    "it lies within the blue lobe close to the position of the methanol masers observed by minier et al .",
    "this leads to the hypothesis that even at 18 @xmath26 m we are seeing scattered light .",
    "if this is the case , then we expect the 10 @xmath26 m emission to peak further from the outflow center .",
    "this does not appear to be the case but it is difficult to be sure since the hot core is weaker relative to the uchii  region at 10 @xmath26 m .",
    "this interpretation is tentative at best since the warm dust in the hiiregion dominates the emission at these mid - ir wavelengths and makes the isolation of the hot - core emission non - trivial .",
    "however , it is useful to examine our data for further support .    in section [ masses ]",
    "above , we estimated that the extinction toward the hot cores is significant even in the mid - infrared ( 450 to 520 magnitudes at 20 @xmath26 m ) .",
    "this , and the extra extinction caused by the 18-@xmath26 m silicate absorption feature ( e.g.  mathis 1990 ) , would result in the hot core emission to be strongly self - absorbed at 18-@xmath26 m .",
    "therefore the only way that light can escape is through a cavity .",
    "an outflow provides a natural explanation for the presence of a cavity , and so we conclude that the evidence strongly suggests that the 18-@xmath26 m source detected by de buizer et al .",
    "( 2002 ) is in fact scattered light .",
    "it is interesting to note the recent conclusion of mccabe , duchne & ghez ( 2003 ) that the 12-@xmath26 m emission toward the t tauri star hk tau b appears to be scattered light .",
    "hofner et al .  (",
    "2001 ) argue that the outflow in g9.62f is observed almost pole - on since weak near - infrared emission is detected . if our scattered - light interpretation is correct , then g9.62f should be easily detected at 18-@xmath26 m and observed coincident with the hot core , since the dust column to the central source will be much less .",
    "similar observations of g10.47 and g31.41 are desirable to test whether these sources are visible at 18 @xmath26 m .",
    "we have presented high - resolution observations made with the bima millimetre array of the 2(2,0)@xmath12(1,1 ) transition of h@xmath0s  and 2@xmath11 transition of c@xmath2o  toward a sample of four hot cores : g9.62 + 0.19 , g10.47 + 0.03 , g29.96@xmath30.02 and g31.41 + 0.31 . in three of the four cases ( g9.62f , g29.96 and g31.41 ) ,",
    "high - velocity h@xmath0semission is observed which is distributed in a spatially - bipolar fashion , in a direction offset from the major axis of the hot core ( as defined by the integrated intensity ) .",
    "in addition , linear velocity gradients are observed in both c@xmath2o  and h@xmath0s  along the major axis of these three cores . only in g10.47",
    "+ 0.03 are the data ambiguous , showing neither clear rotation nor outflow signatures .",
    "although the h@xmath0s  abundance is not well known , we have made reasonable assumptions to derive the parameters of these outflows .",
    "these estimates show that the outflows are indeed driven by massive protostars despite being subject to large uncertainties in the h@xmath0s  abundance .",
    "the lack of centimeter - wave radio emission from within two of the four hot cores shows that outflows begin at a phase prior to the generation of an ultracompact hii  region .",
    "furthermore , our data show only one outflow toward each hot core .",
    "this implies that the observed outflow in h@xmath0s  is dominated by a single source , either by the most massive or by the source which we just happen to catch in this particular phase of evolution .",
    "we interpret these data as indicating the presence of a massive protostar embedded within a hot core , which may be rotating , and driving a molecular outflow .",
    "the bipolar nature implies that these flows are collimated , and we have shown that the ambient material is capable of channeling flows with the properties derived here and , if this is the primary collimation mechanism , then the mass distribution is not spherically symmetric .",
