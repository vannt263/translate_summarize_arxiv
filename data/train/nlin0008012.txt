    "<S> +    2    dispersion - managed ( dm ) system @xcite , which is the system with periodical variation of dispersion along optical fiber , is one of the key point of current development of ultrafast high - bit - rate optical communication lines @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main factor limiting the bit - rate capacity is pulse - broadening due to the chromatic dispersion of the optical fiber which can be overcome by periodical changing of sigh of fiber s dispersion to create very low ( or even zero ) path - average dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> lossless propagation of optical pulse in dm fiber is described by nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) with periodically varying dispersion @xmath0 :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the envelope of optical pulse , @xmath3 is the propagation distance and all quantities are made dimensionless . consider two - step periodic dispersion map : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 for @xmath6 and @xmath7 for @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the path - averaged dispersion , @xmath10 is the amplitude of dispersion variation , @xmath11 is a dispersion period and @xmath12 is an arbitrary integer number . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 also describes pulse propagation in fiber with losses compensated by periodically placed amplifiers if the distance between amplifiers is much less than @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> provided a characteristic nonlinear length @xmath14 of the pulse is large : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is a typical pulse amplitude , the eq . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 can be reduced to path - averaged gabitov - turitsyn @xcite model : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a dispersion map strength , @xmath20 and @xmath21 is fourier component of @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> gabitov - turitsyn model is based on the assumption of slow variation of @xmath23 as a function of @xmath3 on scales of the order of dm period @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this model is good supported by numerical simulations @xcite . returning to t - space </S>",
    "<S> one can get @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( note difference in definition of @xmath26 in comparison with @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> it was found numerically @xcite that gaussian ansatz @xmath27 where @xmath28 are real constants , is a rather good approximation for the soliton solution @xmath29 ( @xmath30 is real ) of eq . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 for small and moderate values of @xmath31 at space points @xmath32 respectively @xmath33 is also a good approximation for the soliton solution @xmath34 of @xmath35 on soliton solution eq . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath36 takes the form : @xmath37    based on this observation the soliton solution of @xmath13 was approximated in @xcite by gaussian exponent multiplied by a sum consisting of a finite number of hermite polynomials . because infinite set of these polynomials is complete in the space of square - integrable function , @xmath22 can be expanded over this set . </S>",
    "<S> but for large enough @xmath31 such approximation can not be effective because of highly oscillating tails @xcite of @xmath30 for @xmath38 which requires to take into account very large number terms of expansion to get reasonable approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillating tails of @xmath30 are of big importance because they are responsible for interaction of a sequence of solitons launched in optical fiber which limits bit - rate capacity @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> the convergent set of approximate solutions of @xmath39 is found by iterating that eq . for @xmath40 zero iteration @xmath41 </S>",
    "<S> is given by @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath42 is obtained by substitution of @xmath43 into right hand side of @xmath39 for @xmath44 the oscillating tails appear at first iteration already . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneously one can get the dependence of @xmath45 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33 on dispersion map strength @xmath46 .    rewriting the kernel of @xmath47 via parametric integral : @xmath48 and using @xmath33 as </S>",
    "<S> zero iteration allow to make integration over time variables @xmath49 in @xmath36 explicitly and get expressions for first @xmath50 , second @xmath51 etc . </S>",
    "<S> iterations : @xmath52 where @xmath53 integration limits for all variables are @xmath54 $ ] , @xmath55 , @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 is determined by the condition @xmath61 for all @xmath62 note that instead of keeping @xmath63 constant for all iterations it is also possible to fix the integral @xmath64 if one aims to get soliton solution with some definite value of @xmath65 . in principle </S>",
    "<S> any values of @xmath66 can be chosen for zero iteration but the most useful is to choose them in such a way to get @xmath50 as close as possible to @xmath41 in order to get faster convergence of iterations to true solution of eq . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath67 it is convenient to make series expansion @xmath50 in powers of @xmath68 which allows to integrate all terms of this expansion explicitly . in particular @xmath69 where c.c . </S>",
    "<S> means complex conjugation . </S>",
    "<S> equating terms proportional @xmath68 in series expansion of @xmath50 and @xmath33 one gets from @xmath70 transcendental equation for @xmath71 which gives @xmath72 and using @xmath39 with the same accuracy @xmath73 fig.1 shows the results of first four iterations obtained numerically for @xmath74 @xmath75 and @xmath76 are given by @xmath77 it is enough to consider only positive values of @xmath31 because @xmath78 is an even function of @xmath79 note that in case @xmath80 eq . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath39 is invariant under two scaling transforms : @xmath81 and @xmath82 , which allows to extend results of fig.1 to all values of system parameters @xmath83 ( of course it has a sense to consider only such values of @xmath84 for which condition @xmath85 holds ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 that the convergence of iteration procedure to soliton solution is very fast for small @xmath31 and becomes slower for larger @xmath31 . for @xmath86 </S>",
    "<S> the renormalization of @xmath50 by next iteration is very small . in particular for all @xmath87 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath88 differs from @xmath45 determined by @xmath89 for less that @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath91 the good approximation is given by second iteration , for @xmath92 by third etc . </S>",
    "<S> the sequence of iteration can be interpreted as evolution of @xmath30 along some artificial coordinate @xmath93 and it can indicate that the convergence of the solution of @xmath36 during evolution along coordinate @xmath3 to soliton solution @xmath39 should also be slower for larger @xmath31 what is really observed in numerical experiments if @xmath94 is chosen in gaussian form @xcite .    thus , provided the form of soliton is close to gaussian for small and moderate @xmath31 , the value of @xmath95 is universal and is given by @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> zakharov and manakov @xcite proposed the other theory of dm soliton in strong dm limit based on the assumption that typical width of @xmath30 distribution is much less than @xmath96 in present notation it means @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> apriori one can not exclude that soliton solution with @xmath98 is also possible in addition to obtained here . </S>",
    "<S> but such solution can not be gaussian - like and , according to best of my knowledge , in all numerical experiment so far the value of @xmath99 was of the order of unity ( see e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that choice of @xmath98 for zero iteration results in convergence of iteration sequence @xmath100 to gaussian - like solution with @xmath45 is given by @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> it can indicate that solution of @xmath36 for @xmath98 also converges for large @xmath3 to that gaussian - like solution . </S>",
    "<S> one can not also exclude the existence of soliton with @xmath98 for @xmath101 which is outside the scope of the present paper .    </S>",
    "<S> let us try to explore in more details in what sense soliton solution @xmath30 is close to gaussian . from @xmath102 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath89 one can get series expansion ( the approximate numerical value of @xmath71 is used here to avoid writing a cumbersome expression for every term of expansion ) : @xmath103 one can conclude from this expansion that @xmath30 can be written as multiplication of gaussian exponent @xmath33 on a slow function which changes significantly on scales @xmath104 . for this and larger scales </S>",
    "<S> there is no similarity between soliton and @xmath105 thus dm soliton is close to gaussian exponent only with accuracy up to numerically `` small parameter '' @xmath106 ( because scale of gaussian exponent is @xmath107 ) and there is no really small parameter describing this closeness . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless appearance of numerical `` small parameter '' @xmath108 explains success of expansion of dm soliton solution in hermite polynomials @xcite which is basically equivalent to expansion @xmath109 in taylor series .    for larger scales @xmath110 the correct presentation of dm soliton </S>",
    "<S> requires a lot of terms of series expansion </S>",
    "<S> . instead one can get asymptotical behavior from @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. the asymptotic of the first iteration is given by : @xmath111+c.c.+o(\\frac{1}{t^6})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] fig.2 shows that eq . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath112 ( curve 2 ) is a relatively good approximation of @xmath50 ( curve 1 ) for @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> but of course to improve accuracy of soliton solution approximation it is necessary to get asymptotic of next iterations . </S>",
    "<S> another way is to use the series expansion @xmath109 as zero iteration instead of @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. keeping first four terms of this expansion for zero iteration one can get parametric integral similar to @xmath100 which gives good approximation of @xmath114 in @xmath100 for @xmath115 detail consideration of this approximation is outside the scope of the present paper .    </S>",
