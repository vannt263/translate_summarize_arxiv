    "color diagram of paper i , there are only @xmath14 m33 star clusters , since @xmath15 star clusters have no @xmath16 data .",
    "so , integrated magnitudes of these star clusters in @xmath10 and @xmath12 bands are emergently needed for studying the properties of m33 star clusters . in this paper",
    ", we will provide @xmath0 photometry of m33 star clusters from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",

    "@xcite presented integrated photometry and color  magnitude diagrams for 161 star clusters in m33 based on the acs / wfc images , of which 115 were previously uncataloged . by cross - checking with the updated photometric catalog of m33 star cluster and candidate in paper i",
    ", we found that , the photometry of 36 star clusters of @xcite was not presented in paper i , of which the 32 star clusters were newly detected by @xcite and the remaining four were detected by previous studies .",
    "the three of the four star clusters were included in @xcite and were classified as ` stellar ' ( objects 69 , 293 and 279 of sarajedini & mancone 2007 which being called star clusters 36 , 195 and 197 in park & lee 2007 , respectively ) , and the remaining one is star cluster 75 in @xcite .",
    "the photometry of 118 star clusters of @xcite was not presented in paper i , of which 115 star clusters were newly detected by @xcite based on the acs / wfc images , and the remaining three star clusters were included in @xcite which were classified as ` galaxy ' or ` stellar ' ( objects 57 , 62 and 69 of sarajedini & mancone 2007 which being called star clusters 27 , 34 and 38 in san roman et al .",
    "the photometry of all star clusters of @xcite was not presented in paper i , of which one star cluster was included in @xcite and was classified as ` galaxy ' ( object 57 of sarajedini & mancone 2007 which being called 33 - 3 - 021 in zloczewski & kaluzny 2009 ) .",
    "so , in this paper , we will perform photometry for the m33 star clusters in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite that were not presented in paper i. altogether , there are 269 star clusters combining the star clusters from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , by cross - checking the coordinates of the star clusters of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and by checking the images of star clusters from the lggs images , we found that , star clusters 7 , 10 , 14 , and 18 of @xcite are the same objects with star clusters 33 , 51 , 59 , and 64 of @xcite , respectively . in addition , there are 18 common star clusters between @xcite and @xcite ( see table 3 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "when we do photometry of the sample star clusters in this paper , we found that , there is nothing in the position of star cluster 195 of @xcite ( i.e. , no .",
    "17 of bedin et al . 2005 ) , which was named object 293 in @xcite and was classified as ` stellar ' by @xcite .",
    "we also found that , in the lggs images of m33 , ( 1 ) there are some bright objects near star cluster 12 of @xcite ; ( 2 ) there is a bright object near star clusters 23 and 32 of @xcite , respectively ; ( 3 ) there is a bright object very near star clusters 15 , 114 and 141 of @xcite , respectively ; ( 4 ) there are three bright objects near star cluster 143 of @xcite ; ( 5 ) there is a very close object to star clusters zk-21 , zk-22 , zk-28 , zk-66 and zk-72 of @xcite , respectively .",
    "the photometry of these 13 star clusters can not be determined accurately in this paper .",
    "so , this paper will present homogeneous @xmath0 photometries for 234 star clusters in m33 using the images of the lggs ( see details about the lggs in paper i ) .",
    "we used the lggs archival images of m33 in the @xmath0 bands to do photometry ( see details in paper i ) .",
    "we performed aperture photometry of the 234 m33 star clusters found in the lggs images in all of the @xmath0 bands to provide a comprehensive and homogeneous photometric catalog for them .",
    "the photometry routine we used is iraf / daophot @xcite .",
    "the photometric process used in this paper is the same as in paper i. we have checked the aperture of every sample star cluster considered here by visual examination to make sure that it was not too large ( to avoid contamination from other sources ) .",
    "the aperture photometry of star clusters was transformed to the standard system using transformation ( constant offsets neglecting color term ) derived based on aperture photometry of stars whose @xmath0 magnitudes were published by @xcite , who calibrated their photometry with standard stars of @xcite .",
    "finally , except for star cluster 27 of @xcite ( i.e. , sr27 , which was named 33 - 3 - 021 in zloczewski & kaluzny 2009 ) and zk-82 of @xcite in the @xmath13 band , and zk-90 of @xcite in the @xmath18 and @xmath13 bands , we obtained photometry for 234 star clusters in the individual @xmath0 bands .",
    "sr27 falls in the gap of the lggs image in the @xmath13 band , and zk-82 and zk-90 in the @xmath13 band fall in the bleeding ccd column of a saturated star , and zk-90 in the @xmath18 band does not lie in the lggs image .",
    "table 1 lists our new @xmath0 magnitudes and the aperture radii used ( we adopted 0.258pixel@xmath19 from the image header ) , with errors given by iraf / daophot .",
    "the star cluster names follow the naming convention of @xcite ( i.e. , @xmath20 ) , @xcite ( i.e. , @xmath21 ) , @xcite ( i.e. , @xmath22 ) , and @xcite . in addition",
    ", we also list the reddening values of the sample star clusters in table 1 ( see section 3.1 for details ) . in table 1 ,",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 mean that @xmath25 magnitudes are on johnson  kron  cousins system .",
    "to examine the quality and reliability of our photometry , we compared the aperture magnitudes of the 234 star clusters obtained here with previous photometry of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "there are eight star clusters , of which the magnitude scatters in the @xmath12 band between this study and previous studies of @xcite and @xcite are larger than 1.0 mag , i.e. , our magnitudes are fainter than those obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we listed the comparison between this study and previous studies of @xmath12 photometry for these eight star clusters in table 2 .",
    "we also plotted their images in figure 2 , in which the circles are photometric apertures adopted here . from this figure",
    ", we can see that nearly all these star clusters are close to one or more bright sources .",
    "if photometric apertures are larger than the values adopted here , the light from these bright sources will not be excluded . as we know",
    "that , in @xcite , the @xmath11 integrated aperture photometry of m33 star clusters , which is included in @xmath26 field of m33 based on ccd images taken with the cfh12k mosaic camera at the cfht , is derived with an aperture of @xmath27 for @xmath12 magnitude measurement and an aperture of @xmath28 for the measurement of color .",
    "@xcite derived integrated photometry and color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for 161 star clusters in m33 using the acs / wfc images .",
    "these authors adopted an aperture radius of @xmath29 for @xmath12 magnitude measurements and @xmath30 for the colors .",
    "for these eight star clusters , a large scatter in the @xmath12 photometric measurement between this study and previous studies @xcite mainly results from different photometric aperture sizes adopted by different authors ( see paper i for details ) .",
    "figures 35 show the comparison of our photometry of the star clusters with previous photometry of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "pl197 is not included in the figure of @xmath31 comparison of figure 3 because of too large value of @xmath31 to be drawn in the figure .",
    "in addition , in figure 5 ( and figures 6 , 8 and 9 below ) , we have transformed the acs / wfc magnitudes in f475w , f606w and f814w bands to the johnson - cousins @xmath10 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 magnitudes using the color - dependent synthetic transformations given by sirianni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .        from figures 35",
    ", we can see that our measurements in the @xmath12 band get systematically fainter than the photometric measurements in @xcite for fainter sources ( @xmath32 mag ) .",
    "the @xmath33 colors obtained here are in good agreement with those in @xcite and @xcite , however , the difference of @xmath34 colors between @xcite and this paper is large , which turned out to be @xmath35 with @xmath36 . from figure 5 , we can see that both the @xmath34 and @xmath33 colors obtained here are in good agreement with those in @xcite , however , the @xmath12 difference between this study and @xcite turned out to be @xmath37 with @xmath38 . by cross - identification , @xcite provided 21 common star clusters in @xcite .",
    "we derived photometry for 18 of these 21 star clusters .",
    "we compared the photometry of these 18 star clusters with previous measurements in @xcite and @xcite for comparison .",
    "figure 6 shows the comparison . from figure 6 , we can see that our measurements in @xmath12 band get systematically fainter than the photometric measurements in @xcite for fainter sources ( @xmath32 mag )",
    ", however , this trend disappears between this study and @xcite . both the @xmath34 and @xmath33 colors obtained here are in good agreement with those in @xcite and @xcite . in paper",
    "i , we has discussed the @xmath12 difference between his study and previous studies in detail , and showed that the @xmath12 difference resulted from different photometric apertures adopted in his study and previous studies . in paper",
    "i , we showed that if the photometric apertures were adopted in our study to be the same as previous studies , the @xmath12 difference disappeared .",
    "in paper i , we has presented some results for m33 star clusters including the cmd and color  color diagram .",
    "in addition , in paper i , we pointed out that , before @xcite , none of m33 star clusters with @xmath39 mag has been detected .",
    "and @xcite emphasized that the faintest known globular cluster in the milky way has @xmath40 mag comparing with @xmath41 mag ( @xmath42 mag ) observed for the faintest of the known m33 globular cluster candidates before @xcite .",
    "@xcite provided integrated magnitudes for 115 m33 star clusters using the acs / wfc images , of which nine have @xmath43 corresponding to @xmath44 .",
    "although the faintest star cluster of m33 detected by @xcite is 2.0 mag brighter than the faintest galactic globular cluster , it will provide something unique to the analysis of m33 star clusters when including them .",
    "in fact , paper i included the photometry of the m33 star clusters in @xcite when we provided the results for m33 star clusters , however , most star clusters in @xcite have photometry in only two bands ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) .",
    "there are only 19 sample star clusters of @xcite in the color  color diagram provided in paper i. in addition , most star clusters in @xcite also have photometry in only two bands ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) .",
    "so , it is necessary that we re - provide a cmd and color  color diagram of m33 including photometry obtained in this paper .",
    "the cmd can provide a qualitative model - independent global indication of cluster - formation history that can be compared between galaxies because @xmath45 and @xmath46 are reasonably good age indicators , at least between young and old populations , with a secondary dependence on metallicity @xcite .",
    "cmds of m33 star clusters have been previously discussed in the literature ( christian & schommer 1982 , 1988 ; chandar et al .",
    "1999b ; park & lee 2007 ; paper i ) .",
    "however , with a much larger star cluster sample in this paper , it is worth investigating them again .",
    "this paper includes 523 star clusters of m33 , of which the photometry of 234 and 277 is derived in this paper and in paper i , respectively ; and the photometry of the remaining 12 star clusters is from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , since we can not accurately derive the photometry for these 12 star clusters ( see section 2.2 for details ) .",
    "the 277 star clusters from paper i are confirmed by @xcite ( 254 star clusters ) , @xcite ( 7 star clusters ) , and @xcite ( 16 star clusters ) based on the _ hst _ and high - resolution ground - based imaging .",
    "we point out that the photometry of m33 star clusters obtained in paper i and this study is homogeneous photometric data in the same photometric system . for completeness of data and readers references",
    ", we list the photometry of 277 star clusters of paper i in table 3 including the reddening values from @xcite and @xcite in column 9 of table 3 ( table 3 includes @xmath47 missed in paper i. ) . in table 3 ,",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 mean that @xmath25 magnitudes are on johnson  kron  cousins system .",
    "for the reddening values of the star clusters , we used those from @xcite or @xcite . for the star clusters",
    ", @xcite and @xcite both presented their reddening values , we adopted their mean values .",
    "for the star clusters , @xcite and @xcite did not present their reddening values , we adopted a uniform value of @xmath48 typical of the published values for the line - of - sight reddenings to m33 that @xcite adopted .",
    "figure 7 shows the spatial distribution of these 523 star clusters .",
    "the large ellipse is the @xmath49 boundary of the m33 disk @xcite .",
    "figure 8 displays the integrated @xmath50 and @xmath51 cmds of the sample star clusters of m33 .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of the star clusters were derived for the adopted distance modulus of @xmath52 obtained by @xcite .",
    "the interstellar extinction curve , @xmath53 , is taken from @xcite .",
    "below each cmd in figure 8 we plotted the star cluster distribution in color space . to the right of each cmd in figure 8 we showed a histogram of",
    "the star clusters absolute @xmath12 magnitudes .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and paper i showed that the m33 star clusters are roughly separated into blue and red groups with a color boundary of @xmath54 in the @xmath50 based on a small star cluster sample .",
    "however , this feature did not clearly appear in figure 8 as previous studies ( sarajedini & mancone 2007 ; park & lee 2007 ; paper i ) .",
    "figure 8 shows that the star cluster luminosity function peaks near @xmath55 mag , and nearly half of star clusters lies between @xmath56 and @xmath57 mag .    by adding models to the cmds",
    ", we can obtain a more detailed history of star cluster formation .",
    "three fading lines ( @xmath58 as a function of age ) of @xcite for a metallicity of @xmath59 which are thought to be appropriate for m33 star clusters @xcite , assuming a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ; salpeter 1955 ) with lower and upper - mass cut - offs of @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and using the padova-1994 evolutionary tracks , are plotted on the cmds of m33 star clusters for three different total initial masses : @xmath3 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63  @xmath4 .",
    "the majority of m33 star clusters fall between these three fading lines . from figure 8 , we note that none of the youngest clusters ( @xmath2  yr ) have masses approaching @xmath3  @xmath4 , which is consistent with the results of @xcite and paper i. for ages older than @xmath64 yr , some clusters with substantially higher masses are seen .",

    "in general , the star clusters in m33 are located along the sequence that is consistent with the theoretical evolutionary path for @xmath59 , while some are on the redder or bluer side in the @xmath46 color .",
    "the wide color range of m33 star clusters implies a large range of ages , suggesting a prolonged epoch of formation . from figure 9",
