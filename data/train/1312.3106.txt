    "tubular and cylindrical lattices are abundant in living nature and give rise to important filamentous structures , such as bacterial flagella and microtubules . inspired by biology , nanotubes made from various building blocks like carbon @xcite , dna @xcite or amphiphilic molecules",
    "@xcite have been synthesized .",
    "remarkably , in the presence of internal prestress , almost all of these tubular objects can adopt superhelical structures , _",
    "i.e. _ , tubes whose centerline describes a large - scale helix in space",
    ". superhelical carbon nanotubes with micron - meter size pitch have been observed @xcite and their elastic properties probed @xcite .",
    "it is believed that their coiling results from the periodic arrangement of defects ( pairs of heptagon - pentagon rings ) in the hexagonal carbon lattice forming the wall of the tube @xcite .",
    "dna nanotubes @xcite adsorbed on a substrate resemble squeezed helices indicating that they assume a three - dimensional superhelical structure under free conditions @xcite .",
    "supramolecular chiral helical nanofibers made of self - assembling lipids have been synthetized .",
    "it was shown that the torsional stress , created by the steric interactions of the chemical groups at the surface of the tube , causes the nanofibers to coil into a superhelix that minimizes the internal prestress @xcite . in bacterial flagella and microtubules the coexistence of several conformational states of their individual constituents is in elastic conflict with their lattice geometry , resulting in prestresses that can be minimized by forming superhelical shapes @xcite .",
    "the protein monomer units of bacterial flagella are arranged in eleven protofilaments parallel to the centerline that can switch from a short to a longer state and can slide down relative to their lateral neighbors creating local twist and curvature @xcite . in a similar manner ,",
    "the wall of microtubules is made of protofilaments built by the polymerization of tubulin dimers .",
    "there are experimental indications that the tubulin dimers can indeed switch between straight and curved conformational states in the presence of taxol @xcite and display an allosteric cooperative interaction along their protofilaments axes @xcite .",
    "the integrity of the tubular lattice can be maintained either by forcing all protofilaments in their straight state or by creating a mixed phase with a cluster of curved protofilaments while the rest of the protofilaments stays in their straight state .",
    "when this phase is energetically more favorable , the microtubule bends in the direction of the block formed by the curved protofilaments .",
    "since microtubules have internal twist @xcite ( _ i.e. _ , the protofilaments are not parallel to the centerline of the tube but instead wind around it ) , the resulting shape will be a superhelix whose pitch is believed to be given by the internal twist @xcite . remarkably there is some evidence that , in contrast to the bacterial flagella filament and all other structures discussed , microtubules are super - helices that are spontaneously and permanently reshaping on experimental timescales : they change their reference ground state due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "this unusual collective movement was previously proposed and termed the `` wobbling mode '' @xcite .",
    "notable phenomenological models for multistable helices have been developed in the past in order to describe transformations of bacterial flagella @xcite , coiled plant tendrils @xcite , or whole microorganisms @xcite .",
    "the novel and rather unique feature of our present model , that we will explore and illustrate here in depth , will be the extraordinary dynamic behavior associated with the cooperative `` wobbling motion '' of the filament .",
    "although biofilaments are usually studied in the framework of beam elasticity , microtubules can also be modelled as cylindrically wrapped membranes since they are hollow .",
    ", for example , modelled microtubule walls as elastic sheets in order to analyze their elastic properties @xcite . inspired by the polymorphic tube model previously proposed by some of the authors @xcite we study a tubular system that incorporates the idea of lattice confinement of bistable units and cooperativity into an elastic sheet .",
    "numerical simulations and analytical models are combined here to provide an in - depth intuitive understanding of this system .",
    "the prestress , that will be built into our model , will give rise to a remarkable phenomenon : localized conformational deformations , that will behave as quasiparticles , will emerge and govern the collective shape dynamics of the lattice via elastically - mediated interactions .",
    "when we switch on additional mechanical coupling terms in the lattice , these quasiparticles will exhibit cooperative interactions .",
    "the cooperativity will lead to the formation of larger - scale `` quasipolymer '' superstructures that we will show to exhibit rather unusual collective dynamic modes .",
    "the notion of quasiparticles/-polymers is the most natural language to quantitatively describe many new phenomena for which we will collectively use the term confotronic dynamics .",
    "in real biofilament systems this dynamics is usually inaccessible to direct observation .",
    "however , as the internal confotronic modes also govern the behavior of the centerline of the tube as a whole , their existence can be experimentally inferred from the observation of anomalous behaviors of the tube s centerline in well chosen experiments . among them , observing the dynamics of a tube clamped at one end , turns out to be the experiment of choice .",
    "we will see that a lot about the inner confotronic dynamics of quasiparticles can be revealed from the external behavior of the tube .",
    "the paper starts with a description of the polymorphic tube model in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conformations ] , the notion of quasiparticles ( called `` confoplexes '' ) is presented in detail .",
    "we will see that these particles can form ordered conformational superstructures on the lattice ( called `` confostacks '' ) .",
    "this order is shown to be responsible for the formation of the broken symmetry superhelical tube state , very much akin to the superhelices observed in microtubules and bacterial flagella . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : dynamics ] the confotronic dynamics of clamped polymorphic tubes is analyzed with a particular focus on the remarkable collective mode ( `` wobbling mode '' ) that emerges spontaneously in the system at finite temperature .",
    "we construct a hollow polymorphic tube by discretizing its surface as a mesh of rectangular subunits ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tube ] ) . similarly to previous discrete models of ( linear ) elastic membranes @xcite , the elastic properties of the tube will be enforced via stretching and bending energetic penalties of the mesh .",
    "the polymorphic character of the tube is implemented at the level of each subunit , decomposed into two squares , which is multistable and can be either straight or curved ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dwell ] ) . note that this choice of mesh is well adapted to describe biofilaments such as microtubules . in this picture ,",
    "each rectangular , double - square subunit of the mesh corresponds to a single tubulin dimer .",
    "the association of the former along the vertical direction defines protofilaments ( blue in fig .",
    "[ fig : tube ] ) which form the tube in a way similar to protofilaments forming the wall of a microtubule . in this work",
    "we always consider @xmath0 such protofilaments alluding again to microtubules .",
    "to stay as generic as possible , however , we will omit many system - specific details like the internal twist and other particularities of microtubules like the seam  @xcite .",
    "such generic simplifications , including symmetry , are necessary in order to extract the physical `` gist '' of such systems , as we will see from the plethora of phenomena emerging already in this simplified lattice geometry .",
    "each dimer consists of internal and external bonds .",
    "the horizontal internal bond @xmath1 separates the subunit into two squares and forms a _ hinge _ in the curved state of the dimer .",

    "the external bonds are shared with neighboring dimers : two bonds of type @xmath3 along the vertical and four of type @xmath4 along the horizontal direction .",
    "the elastic energy of the tube is a sum of contributions for stretching and bending of the mesh , @xmath5 . denoting @xmath6 the vector associated to a bond of type @xmath7 , the total stretching energy of _ all _ bonds of type @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 in the harmonic approximation .",

    "the total bending energy of the mesh is thus @xmath27 .    in the following",
    ", the values of the stretching rigidities will be expressed in units of @xmath28 and the bending rigidities in units of @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the room temperature and @xmath31 nm the size of a monomer ( see appendix  [ app : simulations ] for all the parameter values ) . the temperature @xmath32 in the simulations will be measured in units of @xmath30 .",
    "the rich conformational properties of the previously defined tube model will now be analyzed with the help of numerical simulations and phenomenological models .",
    "the large number of parameters of the model is a serious limitation for exploring all possible conformations in an attempt to build a complete phase diagram .",
    "instead , we reduce the number of independent parameters as much as possible and look for interesting generic configurations and behavior . in this spirit , we set @xmath33 and choose their value in the typical range of the elastic constants of microtubules @xcite ( see below ) . to facilitate the visual and numerical detection of the characteristic behavior for the short lattices practically accessible to our simulations , we have deliberately chosen an intrinsic curvature of the protofilaments much larger than for real microtubules .",
    "the other parameters are adjusted to ensure the numerical stability of the mesh ( see appendix  [ app : simulations ] ) .",

    "our study is built up in a hierachical manner : first the different conformations of a single section of a tube are explored , from which , in a second step , we can understand the behavior of longer tubes .",
    "finally , long tubes with additional cooperative interactions along the protofilaments are studied .        :",

    "we observe three different types of configurations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dimerring ] ) : for sufficiently large values of @xmath34 ( at the order of @xmath35 ) the dimers can not switch to their curved configuration and the ring maintains its cylindrical form .",
    "however , when @xmath34 becomes smaller ( @xmath36 ) , all subunits adopt a curved conformation , forming what we call a `` conformational complex '' or ",
    "more briefly  a _ confoplex_. the ring is still cylindrically symmetric but its shape is catenoid - like . very interestingly , for intermediate values of @xmath34 ( around @xmath37 ) a state with _ broken cylindrical symmetry _",
    "is the minimum - energy configuration . in this",
    "_ partial confoplex _",
    "conformation a cluster of neighboring dimers on one side of the ring is switched to the curved state , thereby creating a negatively curved scar which gradually decays towards the opposite side of the tube .",
    "this causes the opposite wall to bulge slightly outwards .",
    "the emergence of full and partial confoplexes in the ring leads to the interesting question of how single confoplexes interact with each other in a larger lattice .",
    "in contrast to the single section , which does not possess any longitudinal neighbors , the bending around the bonds of type @xmath3 will now have an important effect .",
    "for the case of full confoplexes successive sections meet at positive curvatures at the @xmath3 bonds .",
    "hence , for non - zero @xmath38 , stacking one full confoplex on top of a second one will cost some energy ; when the value of @xmath38 is high enough to dominate the other terms , the tube goes back to the straight configuration .    for values of @xmath34 for which the tube is composed of partial confoplexes",
    ", the deflection of each section is expected to be in almost independent directions if @xmath38 is zero .",
    "( in fact , they are not completely uncorrelated due to the stretching energy of the bonds @xmath3 . )",
    "this almost random mutual orientation has been confirmed by simulations at finite temperature ( not shown ) .",
    "however , for non - zero values of @xmath38 , ( _ e.g. _ for @xmath39 ) , each section conserves its partial confoplex configuration but neighboring confoplexes tend to align their orientation opposite to each other , forming an antiferromagnetic - like zigzag pattern along the tube ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2body ] for an example at temperature t=3 ) .",
    "if we keep increasing @xmath38 , the confoplexes become gradually smaller in size and finally vanish , similar to the catenoid - to - cylinder transition found for the ring when @xmath34 is increasing .",
    "the repulsive interaction of confoplexes implies that global conformational superstructures of the tube are formed only if neighboring confoplexes interact cooperatively via additional interactions .",
    "cooperative interactions among monomers in a filament have been observed , for example , in single protofilaments of microtubules _ in vitro _",
    "@xcite . motivated by this observation ,",
    "we implement the coupling between neighboring dimers on a protofilament by adding a cooperative interaction between the angles associated to the anharmonic bonds @xmath1 : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the strength of the cooperative interaction between a bond @xmath1 and its nearest neighbors ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath1-next and @xmath1-previous ) . in the presence of partial confoplexes",
    "this term causes an attractive interaction between them , opposing the repulsive one ( due to the bending @xmath42 and generating an interesting `` frustrated '' situation .",
    "the attraction between neighboring partial confoplexes leads to a stack of confoplexes forming a kind of `` quasipolymer '' superstructure arrangement on the lattice .",
    "this particular internal state of the lattice , being an ordered stack of confoplexes , will from now on be called a _ `` confostack''_. in a similar manner as the emergence of the confoplex previously gave rise to the breaking of the cylindrical symmetry on the _ single section scale _ , the formation of the ordered confostack is responsible for the spontaneous breaking of the _ large scale _ chiral symmetry of the tube centerline in the three - dimensional space .    at finite temperature ,",
    "thermal fluctuations tend to disorganize the ordered confostack . in this case",
    "we observe the formation of uncorrelated fluctuating domains of ordered confoplexes distributed along the confostack .",
    "the characteristic size of such a domain will be called the coherence length of the confostack and denoted with @xmath43 this coherence length shares some analogy to the concept of persistence length of a semiflexible polymer . in particular we can write @xmath44 where @xmath24 ( an unknown function of the material parameters ) can be seen as an effective stiffness of the confostack .",
    "note that an exact computation of @xmath45 for a simplified model of microtubules can be found in ref .",
    "we expect two extreme situations : for a tube of length @xmath46 such that @xmath47 the confostack is fully ordered and the entire tube breaks the cylindrical symmetry . for @xmath48",
    "the confostack is made up of a juxtaposition of uncorrelated fluctuating domains of ordered confoplexes leading to a statistically straight tube on average .",
    "what is the fundamental shape of a single domain of an ordered stack of confoplexes ?",
    "the answer comes from the numerical simulations .",
    "[ fig : coop20]-[fig : coop12 ] show a number of snapshots of the typical configurations of the tube at finite temperature for increasing values of the ratio @xmath49 in fig .",
    "[ fig : coop20 ] where @xmath50 is small , we see that the confostack is made of short coherent helices of random handedness .",
    "this corresponds to the situation @xmath48 where the tube looks straight on long scales , since right- and left - handed helices cancel each other out .",
    "the fundamental shape of a domain of ordered confoplexes is thus a helix with a pitch which depends on @xmath51 the origin of this helicity will be elucidated below in section  [ subsubsec : confostackformation ] .",
    "increasing @xmath50 leads to a stronger alignment of the partial confoplexes , i.e. , an increase of the pitch of the confostack . when the coherence length is larger than @xmath46 but the pitch is still smaller than @xmath46 , the switched dimers form a coherent helical confostack , deflecting the centerline of the tube into a superhelix in space as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coop14 ] .",
    "note that the superhelices of either handedness appear spontaneously within a completely symmetric lattice .",
    "this can be seen as an indication that real microtubules might form superhelices with finite pitches by a similar spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism , even in the absence of an explicit internal lattice twist @xcite .",
    "for very large @xmath52 the cooperativity is strong enough for the pitch of the helical confostack to become larger than @xmath46 .",
    "[ fig : coop12 ] shows such a situation with @xmath53 . in this case",
    "the tube forms a circular arc with an untwisted confostack living on it .      after outlining the empirical observations of various interesting phenomena from the langevin simulations in the previous section , in this section we seek to analytically and phenomenologically explain the observations . in the first subsection",
    "we will explore how the very existence of full / partial confoplexes can be qualitatively understood within a simple analytical model . following that ,",
    "in the second subsection , we outline a simple phenomenological model explaining the chiral symmetry breaking and the formation of the left-/right - handed superhelical confostacks .       in the simple model . ]    in this section we revisit the transitions between the different states of a single section ( cylinder , partial and full confoplex ) and will explain them qualitatively .",
    "for all three states in fig .",
    "[ fig : dimerring ] , we observe that the horizontal bonds form polygons which are close to circles lying in three parallel planes . for a full catenoid - like confoplex",
    ", we see that the circle in the middle ( called @xmath54 because it is associated to the anharmonic bonds @xmath1 ) has the smallest radius , whereas for the partial confoplex there is additionally a small shift of the center of @xmath54 .",
    "this shift is in the direction of the non - switched region of the wall , which thus bulges slightly outwards . in view of these observations , it is tempting to approximate a section of the tube by three circles that will interact elastically in a very simplified manner ( thus the results can only be qualitatively compared with the simulation ) . by fixing the center position and the radius @xmath55 of the lower and upper circles ,",
    "the only variables are now the position and the radius of the circle @xmath54 in the middle .",
    "this circle can shift its center horizontally by an amount of @xmath56 .",
    "it can also decrease its radius @xmath55 by @xmath57 with an energy cost @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the stretching rigidity of @xmath54 .",
    "for a confoplex there is an additional cost of bending energy due to the angle @xmath60 between the lines joining the three circles at an azimuthal position @xmath61 of @xmath54 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : energysimple ] ) .",
    "this angle is chosen negative in the concave part of the confoplex and given by @xmath62 to first order in @xmath57 and @xmath56 .",
    "similar to the anharmonic bending energy  ( [ eq : anharmonic ] ) for the bonds @xmath1 used in the simulations , we write the bending energy of the simple model as a double well potential and integrate it along @xmath63@xmath64 by minimizing the total energy of this three circle model , @xmath65 , with respect to @xmath56 and @xmath66 , we observe the same three configurations as in the numerical simulations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : energysimple ] again ) : for increasing @xmath34 the ground state shifts from a full confoplex ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 where @xmath54 can easily stretch , to a partial one ( @xmath67 and @xmath69 ) which is the result of a compromise between the stretching and the anharmonic bending energy .",
    "for an even larger stretching constant we finally obtain a cylinder ( @xmath70 . this simplified model which only comprises the stretching energy and the anharmonic bending potential of the bond @xmath1 gives a simple explanation for the very existence of confoplexes .",
    "of course , this reduced model is not capable to predict the precise transition values ; nonetheless it provides a qualitative explanation for the observed morphologies in the simulation .",
    "due to its simplicity , it is highly intuitive and also analytically tractable .",
    "[ fig : analogy ]    > from what we learnt previously from the simulations , the shape of the confostack results from the competition between the cooperative attractive interaction and the elastic repulsion between partial confoplexes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : coop ] ) .",
    "if both interactions were short - ranged , one would observe the two configurations depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : analogy1 ] with equal probability as they would have equal energies .    but the observed spontaneous symmetry breaking of the straight tube , which leads to right- and left - handed superhelices , can only be explained by the presence of an effective _ long - range _ repulsion between the confoplexes .",
    "intuitively , the confoplexes can be seen as quasiparticles which deform the lattice surrounding them , generating an extended elastic field . as a consequence",
    "the confoplexes will interact with each other through long - range elastically - mediated repulsive forces , extending further away than to the nearest neighbors .",
    "a full analytical treatment of this interaction in our concrete case is complicated by the presence of various lattice parameters in the simulation , but a qualitative understanding is possible if we retain only the dominant contributions . in this spirit ,",
    "consider two confoplexes @xmath71 and @xmath72 which azimuthally overlap with an angle @xmath73 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : analogy2 ] ) and interact only elastically without cooperativity ( left image of fig .",
    "[ fig : analogy3 ] ) . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that only the overlapping parts of @xmath71 and @xmath72 interact strongly with each other .",
    "this seems reasonable , since the elastic interaction between the parts of the confoplexes which do not sit on the same protofilament will be more screened around the tube .",
    "if the confoplexes are shifted by an angle @xmath74 their interaction is then proportional to the overlap angle @xmath73 , and we can write @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the interaction energy of the parts of the two partial confoplexes sitting on the same protofilament . for a small angular deviation @xmath77 with respect to the straight protofilament state",
    "this energy can be approximated as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the arc length along the protofilament , @xmath80 is the bending rigidity of the protofilament and @xmath81 is an intrinsic effective tension due to the stretching rigidity of the bonds of the protofilament .",
    "( [ eq : energypf ] ) is formally equivalent to the interaction energy of two proteins bound to the same side of a semiflexible filament under an external pulling force .",
    "as shown in @xcite the elastic interaction is repulsive .",
    "similarly , cylindrical proteins bound to a locally flat membrane are described with the same energy functional and repel as well @xcite ) .",
    "the range of this repulsion is given by an elastic screening length @xmath82 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : analogy3 ] ) .    despite the crude approximations considered here the basic physics of the interaction",
    "is well captured . in the presence of cooperativity , this long - range interaction leads to an interplay between nearest and next - nearest neighbor repulsion between the quasiparticles ; at short scale the second configuration in fig .",
    "[ fig : analogy1 ] will be adopted . at a larger scale",
    "the quasipolymer will thus form a helix on the lattice inducing a superhelical structure of the tube in three - dimensional space .    before embarking on the study of the dynamic properties of polymorphic tubes ,",
    "it is interesting to remark , that the notion of quasiparticles , interacting by elastic fields in our present case is rather similar to the notion of `` twist - kinks '' , the quasiparticles formed in squeezed helices confined to two dimensions @xcite . in this context conformational `` twist - kink '' quasiparticles appear as a natural concept as well , indicating a broader relevance of this perspective for prestressed filaments with ( hidden ) internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the observation of microtubules clamped at one end has been a key experiment revealing their anomalous behavior @xcite and was the starting point for the polymorphic tube model proposed in @xcite . in this section",
    "we explore the dynamics of collective internal modes of the lattice by simulating a tube of various lengths clamped at one end , at finite temperature @xmath32 .",
    "we focus on the simplest case in which the tubes form circular arcs ( helices with infinite pitch ) , _ i.e. _ , when they bear ideal untwisted confostacks with a coherence length much larger than the tube s length .        even though the rigid attachment of the arc - shaped tube seems to preclude large scale motion ,",
    "the tube is not static in shape .",
    "instead , we clearly observe a random rotation of the tube around a fixed axis ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rotaty ] ) in agreement with the predictions of the wobbling motion for polymorphic tubes @xcite .",
    "it is intuitively clear that the symmetry - broken circular arc state can in principle explore all its equivalent sister states , with the arc pointing in one of 13 possible directions .",
    "however , it seems not obvious a priori if the switching between the states can practically occur , and if so , on which timescale . to quantify the dynamic behavior of this collective `` wobbling mode '' , we measure the time evolution of the centerline at the free end , which diffuses inside an annular strip in the @xmath83 plane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : endpointdiffusion ] ) .    if the clamped tube was not polymorphic , but had the shape of a",
    "circular arc instead , its elastic fluctuations could be simply decomposed into a radial and an azimuthal elastic mode . in this case",
    "we would expect a classical `` wormlike chain '' dynamic behavior , where the chain has merely an intrinsic curvature .",
    "however , such an intrinsically curved elastic filament would of course not rotate .",
    "in sharp contrast to the wormlike chain case , the observed wobbling scenario allows an efficient rotation ( despite the fixed clamping of the end section ) in our system .",
    "this rotary motion , which is the very signature of a polymorphic lattice with broken symmetry , is apparently caused by a confostack that moves azimuthally around the lattice .",
    "note that we have a peculiarly interesting `` polymer on a polymer '' motif here : a quasipolymeric entity ( the confostack ) exists and moves on the surface of a tube , that itself can be considered as a polymer on larger scales .",
    "the experimentally observable motion of the tube is slaved to the motion of the confostack .",
    "the latter might be practically hidden from direct experimental detection but it affects the tube s centerline dynamics so severely that it becomes detectable by tracing the tube s centerline",

    "however , this expectation is too simple as it considers only the friction of the rotating arc through the external fluid medium and misses the internal dynamics of the confostack , in particular the presence of structural barriers , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "this hidden internal dynamics nevertheless reflects itself in the movement of the end point of the tube and leads to an additional internal dissipation .    in summary ,",
    "the simulations reveal that the tube s friction must result from a combination of the external friction of the arc in the fluid medium and a yet to be characterized internal dissipation mechanism . in the next section",
    ", we explore the origin of this inner dissipation mechanism .",
    "in particular , we take a closer look at the conformational mode responsible for these inner losses via barrier crossing .      until now",
    ", we have analyzed the wobbling motion by tracking the time evolution of the end point of the centerline . in this section",
    "we go a step further and take advantage of the simulation to directly observe the shape of the confostack on the surface of the lattice . at zero temperature ,",
    "the tube assumes one of its circular ground states oriented along one of the 13 possible orientations . at any finite temperature ,",
    "thermal excitations allow for a continuous shape reorientation of the confostack between the ground states by crossing the energy barrier @xmath88 , while at the same time reorienting the direction of the tube s curvature .    what is the critical confostack mode , _",
    "i.e. _ , the conformation of the confostack at the top of the energy barrier @xmath88 ?    a nave first look into the noisy simulation snapshots of the tube in space does not allow to identify the critical conformational mode on the barrier ( at the transition ) in a simple way .",
    "but if one rotates the tube in its natural co - moving frame of reference first ( see next section for details ) , one can observe the behavior of the confostack on the surface of the tube in detail .",
    "this frame is defined by the @xmath105 plane formed by the attachment point and the end of the centerline of the tube .",
    "therefore , the deflection perpendicular to the @xmath105 plane , @xmath106 , satisfies the condition @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the arc length of the centerline . at zero temperature ,",
    "the confostack lies in the @xmath105 plane and the centerline of the tube is a circular arc . in this case",
    "the co - moving and the laboratory frames are identical . at finite temperature and for the transition regions ,",
    "we typically observe a confostack forming a kink on the lattice which will propagate until the whole structure has crossed the barrier ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : kink1 ] for a snapshot ) .",
    "this confostack - kink resembles a `` polymorphic '' dislocation that can be either left- or right - handed , while reorienting the direction of the whole tube .    to capture and characterize the shape of the confostack - kink under the conditions of strong thermal noise",
    ", we have looked for statistical anomalies of the tube s shape in the co - moving coordinates .",
    "since the centerline of the tube leaves the @xmath105 plane only slightly , we expect that @xmath109 still describes a circular arc approximately ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "this is confirmed by the numerical data ( not shown ) .",
    "what turns out to be more interesting is the @xmath111 direction .",
    "the root mean square @xmath112 of the deflection @xmath106 of the centerline is computed over all transition states ( red circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffusion ] ) .",
    "they correspond to the critical confostack - kink at the top of the energy barrier @xmath88 .",
    "this kink can either move to the next minimum of the periodic potential @xmath87 or return to the original minimum .",
    "the curve @xmath112 is significantly different from the measurement of the same quantity for all  transition and non - transition  states of the simulation taken together @xmath113 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kink2 ] .      to understand the unusual dynamics of the clamped tube observed in the simulations and to interpret the behavior of the confostack - kink at the barrier , in this section we make some theoretical developments .",
    "we first define an external laboratory frame @xmath114 .",
    "the tube is clamped at the origin and is oriented in the @xmath115 direction . for small deviations around the @xmath115 axis , the unit vector tangent to the tube s centerline is approximately given by @xmath116 with @xmath117 the deflection angles of the centerline in the @xmath118 direction .",
    "this deflection can be decomposed as the sum @xmath119 of a purely elastic deviation and a polymorphic one @xcite .",
    "the polymorphic contribution can be expressed in terms of a polymorphic phase @xmath120 which stands for the confostack s angular orientation with respect to the tube s material frame .",

    "the theoretical modelling in the previous sections allowed us to deepen our understanding of the confostack dynamics in the presence of a barrier . with this knowledge we can return to the anomalous diffusion of the clamped tube .",

    "as motivated by biological systems ) and in turn polymerizing  a number of confoplexes on the tubular lattice , a plethora of different phenomena have been discovered : the tube spontaneously breaks its cylindrical symmetry and forms superhelical structures in three - dimensional space .",
    "remarkably , at finite temperature , the movement of the quasipolymer built out of confoplexes on the lattice constantly reshapes the whole tube inducing a random rotation for a clamped tube .",

    "it is the idea of localized conformational quasiparticles living on the lattice . we have seen how an elementary quasiparticle  the confoplex  emerges and how it interacts with others of the same kind via elastic lattice modes .",
    "once an additional cooperative interaction is introduced , the particle - like confoplexes are forced together into an extended polymer - like conformational object  the confostack",
