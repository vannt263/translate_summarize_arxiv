    "<S> nuclear shell model predictions for the proton spectroscopic factor of the @xmath0 , e@xmath1 = 5.68 mev level in @xmath2si are about fifty times smaller than the value suggested by the measured ( @xmath3,@xmath4he ) cross section for the e@xmath1= 5.69 mev mirror level in @xmath2 mg , assuming purely single - particle transfer . given that the 5.69 mev level has been very weakly , if it all , populated in previous studies of the simpler @xmath5mg(d , p ) reaction , it is unclear if the ( @xmath3,@xmath4he ) result is a true single - particle spectroscopic factor . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume the ( @xmath3,@xmath4he ) result , the thermonuclear rate of the @xmath5al(p,@xmath6)@xmath2si reaction would increase by factors of @xmath7 over stellar temperatures of @xmath8 gk . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the implications of this enhanced rate for model predictions of nucleosynthesis in classical nova explosions .    * </S>",
    "<S> pacs number(s ) : * 21.10.jx , 26.30.-k , 27.30.+t    significant progress has been made in recent years to better determine charged - particle thermonuclear reaction rates involved in classical nova explosions . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> most of these rates can be specified with experimentally based uncertainties over the relevant stellar temperatures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the thermonuclear rate of the @xmath5al(@xmath9)@xmath2si reaction ( @xmath10 kev @xcite ) is considered to be one of the few remaining rates with an uncertainty large enough to significantly affect model predictions of nucleosynthesis in classical nova explosions ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) . over temperatures involved in novae </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath11 gk ) this rate is dominated by contributions from direct capture , a @xmath0 resonance at e@xmath1(@xmath2si ) = 5.68 mev , and a @xmath12 resonance at 5.92 mev . </S>",
    "<S> as well , a @xmath13 resonance at 5.95 mev is a minor contributor for @xmath14 gk . </S>",
    "<S> these contributions to the total rate , as tabulated in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we note that recent recommended rates @xcite all agree to a factor of @xmath15 over the relevant temperatures .    </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainty in this rate is difficult to quantify since direct measurements of the strengths of the @xmath0 and @xmath12 resonances are not yet possible . instead </S>",
    "<S> , shell model calculations , information from the @xmath16-decay of @xmath2p , and information from mirror states in @xmath2 mg have been used to estimate and constrain the proton and @xmath6-ray partial widths of these two states . </S>",
    "<S> these quantities can then be used to determine resonance strengths and the corresponding resonant contributions of these states to the total thermonuclear rate , as in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 , 5.69 mev and @xmath12 , 6.13 mev levels in @xmath2 mg are the most likely mirror states of the two important resonances in @xmath2si due to the lack of other candidates in this energy region of @xmath2 mg @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recent determinations of the @xmath5al(@xmath9 ) rate have used proton spectroscopic factors @xmath17 to estimate the required proton partial widths @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these quantities have been calculated using the shell model @xcite , and , for the @xmath12 resonance , adopted from the mirror state @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . uncertainties of a factor of three have been assumed for proton partial widths estimated using quantities calculated though the shell model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite found that a @xmath18 uncertainty in their theoretical spectroscopic factors accounts for the spread in values determined using different @xmath19-shell hamiltonians .    </S>",
    "<S> experimental neutron spectroscopic factors determined in the @xmath5mg(@xmath3,@xmath4he)@xmath2 mg measurement of yasue et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1990 ) @xcite have not been considered , to our knowledge , in any determination of the @xmath5al(p,@xmath6)@xmath2si rate . </S>",
    "<S> these measured values are of interest as they are in good agreement with shell model predictions for most of the states populated , including the @xmath12 and @xmath13 states of concern here . for example , for the @xmath12 , @xmath2si state at e@xmath1 = 5.92 mev , </S>",
    "<S> shell model calculations give @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite ; yasue et al . measured @xmath20 and @xmath22 for the mirror state at e@xmath1(@xmath2 mg ) </S>",
    "<S> = 6.13 mev @xcite . for the @xmath13 , @xmath2si state at e@xmath1 = 5.95 mev , </S>",
    "<S> shell model calculations give @xmath23@xcite and @xmath24@xcite ; yasue et al . measured @xmath25 for the likely mirror state at e@xmath1(@xmath2 mg ) </S>",
    "<S> = 6.26 mev@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> curiously , for the @xmath0 , @xmath2si state at e@xmath1 = 5.68 mev , shell model calculations give @xmath26@xcite , @xmath27@xcite , and @xmath28@xcite ; while yasue et al . </S>",
    "<S> measured @xmath29 for the mirror state at e@xmath1(@xmath2 mg ) = 5.69 mev@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this large disagreement for the @xmath0 resonance may be attributed , in part , to the difficulty in separating the doublet at e@xmath1(@xmath2 mg ) = 5.69 and 5.72 mev when obtaining angular distributions from the @xmath5mg(@xmath3,@xmath4he ) measurement . </S>",
    "<S> this is supported by how differential cross sections for the combined doublet are given at twelve angles between @xmath30 , but cross sections for each member of the doublet are given at only seven angles between @xmath31 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a more pressing issue may lie in the suitability of using the ( @xmath3,@xmath4he ) reaction to study the relevant single - particle properties : yasue et al . </S>",
    "<S> themselves suggest that multi - step processes may be responsible for larger ( @xmath3,@xmath4he ) yields for @xmath0 states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the 5.69 mev state of @xmath2 mg has been very weakly , if it all , populated in previous studies with a simpler neutron - transfer reaction ( @xmath5mg(d , p ) ) and sufficient energy resolution to separate the doublet ( e.g. , refs.@xcite ) . as such </S>",
    "<S> , it is not clear whether the yasue et al . </S>",
    "<S> result for the @xmath0 resonance is a true single - particle spectroscopic factor . with regard to the thermonuclear rate of the @xmath5al(p,@xmath6 ) reaction , a spectroscopic factor of @xmath29 for the important @xmath0 resonance would lead to a total rate that is @xmath7 times larger than recently recommended rates at t @xmath32 gk ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> new high resolution measurements of the @xmath5mg(d , p ) and @xmath5mg(@xmath3,@xmath4he ) reactions , used in conjunction with improved theoretical treatments of the reaction mechanisms , could help to clarify this possible discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> to assess the astrophysical motivation for such measurements , we first use some simple calculations to gain some insight into the possible impact in classical nova explosions of the enhanced @xmath5al(p,@xmath6 ) rate in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . at t </S>",
    "<S> = 0.1 gk , the tabulated total rate of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is @xmath33 cm@xmath4 s@xmath35 mol@xmath35 , with the resonant contribution of the @xmath0 state accounting for @xmath3699% of this value . </S>",
    "<S> use of the yasue et al.@xcite spectroscopic factor for the @xmath0 resonance would lead to a total rate ( at 0.1 gk ) of @xmath37 cm@xmath4 s@xmath35 mol@xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> if we then assume a density of @xmath38 g @xmath39 and a hydrogen mass fraction of @xmath40 ( i.e. , after mixing ) , we would obtain a @xmath5al half life for proton capture of @xmath41 s. similarly , at t = 0.2 gk , use of the yasue et al . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopic factor for the @xmath0 resonance would lead to a @xmath5al half life for proton capture of @xmath42 s. these values may be compared to the half life for the @xmath16-decay of @xmath5al : @xmath43 = 7.2 s. these rough estimates imply that even the enhanced rate of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] would not be expected to compete effectively with the @xmath16-decay of @xmath5al at the relevant temperatures .    </S>",
    "<S> to investigate this issue in more detail , we performed two hydrodynamic simulations to test the impact of an increased @xmath5al(p,@xmath6 ) rate on predictions of nucleosynthesis in classical nova explosions . </S>",
    "<S> the two simulations were identical except for the rate of the @xmath5al(p,@xmath6 ) reaction employed : one used the tabulated reaction rate of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , while the other used an enhanced rate determined using @xmath44 for the @xmath0 resonance ( instead of @xmath26 , as used in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> these two rates are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we have adopted a typical nova scenario consisting of a 1.25 m@xmath45 oxygen - neon white dwarf accreting solar material at a rate of @xmath46 m@xmath45 yr@xmath35 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> mixing at a level of 50% between accreted material and the outermost layer of the white dwarf was assumed . </S>",
    "<S> we found no appreciable differences in the nucleosynthesis of the two models ; predicted yields were in agreement to better than @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> as may be expected from the simple calculations mentioned earlier , even the enhanced @xmath5al(p,@xmath6 ) rate is not large enough to compete effectively with the @xmath16-decay of any @xmath5al produced in nova explosions for t @xmath48 gk . for completeness , we performed a third simulation using a @xmath5al(p,@xmath6 ) rate determined from a spectroscopic factor for the @xmath0 resonance that is 50 times lower than the shell model value of @xmath49 . again , as expected , the calculated yields did not differ significantly from those determined using the tabulated rate of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> nucleosynthesis in the adopted nova model is not very sensitive to variations by a factor of @xmath50 of the theoretical proton spectroscopic factor of the @xmath0 resonance of the @xmath5al(p,@xmath6)@xmath2si reaction . as such , experimental efforts to improve this rate for models of classical nova explosions should probably focus on better contraining the resonant contribution of the key @xmath12 resonance </S>"
