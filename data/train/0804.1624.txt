    "the primary avenue for study of the physical properties of the inter - galactic medium utilises the ly@xmath0 absorption systems observed along the lines - of - sight towards high redshift quasars .",
    "these absorbing systems include the ly@xmath0 forest ( with column depth @xmath2@xmath3 ) , ly - limit systems ( @xmath4@xmath5@xmath3 ) , and damped ly@xmath0 absorbers ( dla , @xmath6@xmath3 ) . the latter are self - shielded and have been shown to host @xmath7 of the neutral hydrogen ( hi ) gas during most of cosmic time @xmath8 ( prochaska et al .  2005 ) .    as the primary reservoirs of neutral gas",
    ", it is thought that dlas provide the dominant sites for star formation , and represent the progenitors of modern galaxies ( woolfe , gawiser & prochaska  2005 ) .",
    "thus the identity of dla hosts is crucial for our understanding of galaxy formation , and of the buildup of stellar mass in the universe .",
    "dla hosts have been identified in a few cases ( e.g. colbert & malkan  2002 ; warren et al .",
    "2001 ) , and observations of these ( with some exceptions ) are consistent with their being at the faint end of the lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) population . on the other hand , these studies",
    "will more easily discover hosts in the most luminous systems , and could therefore be systematically biased in their conclusions . within the cold - dark - matter model",
    "the masses of objects may be determined independently from their luminosity by studying their clustering properties and appealing to theoretical predictions of the bias relative to the underlying mass distribution . at high redshift @xmath9",
    ", clustering analyses have been used in this way to study the host halo masses of quasars ( shen et al .",
    "2007 ; white , martini & cohn  2007 ) , and lbgs ( adelberger et al .",
    "however the numbers of dlas known is small , occurring only once in every few quasar spectra , and so no sample of sufficient size to allow for an auto - correlation clustering analysis exists ( cooke et al .",
    "2006 ) . as a result",
    "a quantitative measurement of dla host mass has remained illusive .",
    "some progress has been made through comparison of clustering with the lbg population through cross - correlation .",
    "cooke et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have performed a survey for lbgs in regions surrounding known dla systems .",
    "this sample allows for measurement of the cross - correlation between dlas and lbgs .",
    "cook et al .",
    "( 2006 ) find the cross - correlation length to be comparable to the correlation length ( adelberger et al .",
    "2005 ) among the large lbg sample of steidel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and so conclude that dla systems have similar masses to lbgs .",
    "they argue for a host halo mass of @xmath10 .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with modeling studies carried out in a cosmological framework ( nagamine et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "alternatively , the presence of cold gas is also traced by mgii absorption .",
    "indeed , mgii absorbers have been shown to be associated with neutral hydrogen absorbers over a range of column densities , including dlas ( e.g. rao et al .",
    "2006 ) , and so mgii absorption is used as a proxy to study the hi galaxy population at @xmath11 . the host halo masses of mgii absorbers have been estimated at @xmath12 via cross - correlation with luminous red galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey data release 3 ( bouch et al .",
    "2006 ) , yielding a host mass of @xmath13 .",
    "the large number of objects available ( both mgii absorbers and galaxies ) yields a statistical accuracy of a factor of 2 in host halo mass , much better than is available using comparable techniques for dlas at higher redshift ( cook et al .",
    "in addition , host masses have been estimated via direct kinematic measurement in spatially resolved followup spectroscopy ( bouch et al .",
    "2007 ) , yielding estimates that are consistent with clustering results .",
    "the small number of known dlas is due to the low density of bright background sources .",
    "an alternative approach is therefore to observe the dla population directly through 21 cm emission .",
    "there is an extensive literature describing the use of redshifted 21 cm observations as a probe of the process of reionization in the high redshift igm [ see furlanetto , oh & briggs  ( 2006 ) for an extensive discussion ] .",
    "reionization starts with ionized ( hii ) regions around galaxies , which later grow to surround groups of galaxies .",
    "the process of reionization is completed when these hii regions overlap ( defining the so - called _ overlap _ epoch ) and fill - up most of the volume between galaxies . the conventional wisdom has been that the 21 cm signal disappears after the _ overlap _ epoch , because there is little neutral hydrogen left through most of intergalactic space .",
    "however , the following simple estimate can be used to demonstrate that 21 cm emission should be significant even after reionization is completed ( wyithe & loeb  2008 ) . as mentioned above ,",
    "dla systems are believed to contain the majority of hi at high redshifts .",
    "indeed , observations of dlas out to a redshift of @xmath14 show the cosmological density parameter of hi to be @xmath15 ( prochaska et al  2005 ) . in the standard cosmological model",
    "the density parameter of baryons is @xmath16 , so that the mass - averaged neutral hydrogen fraction at @xmath14 ( long after the end of the hii overlap epoch ) is @xmath17 .    at @xmath14 , the brightness temperature contrast of redshifted 21 cm emission",
    "will be @xmath18mk . moreover on the @xmath19 co - moving mpc scales relevant for upcoming 21 cm experiments ,",
    "the _ root - mean - square _ amplitude of density fluctuations at @xmath14 is @xmath20 .",
    "hence , we expect fluctuations in the 21 cm intensity field due to dlas to be at least @xmath21mk on 10  comoving mpc scales , with a boost in this signal if the dlas are hosted by biased ( i.e. massive ) dark matter halos ( wyithe & loeb  2008 ) . the fluctuations in the 21 cm emission signal after reionization are therefore expected to be only an order of magnitude or so smaller than the largest fluctuations predicted at any time during the entire reionization era ( e.g. wyithe & morales  2007 ) .",
    "moreover the sky temperature , which provides the limiting factor in the system noise at the low frequencies relevant for 21 cm studies , is proportional to @xmath22 , and so is a factor of @xmath23^{2.6}$ ] smaller at low - redshifts than for observations at @xmath24 .",
    "several experiments are currently under development which aim to detect the 21 cm signal during reionization ( including mwa  , lofar  , paper  , 21cma  ) and more ambitious designs are being planned ( ska  ) .",
    "in addition , the first statistical detection of 21 cm fluctuations due to discrete , unresolved clumps of neutral gas was recently made ( pen et al .",
    "2008 ) through cross - correlation of the hipass ( barnes et al .",
    "2001 ) 21 cm observations of the local universe with galaxies in the 6 degree field galaxy redshift survey ( jones et al .  2004 ; 2005 ) .",
    "this detection represents an important step towards using 21 cm surface brightness fluctuations to probe the neutral gas distribution in the igm ( both during and after reionization ) , as well as the mass power - spectrum ( ps ) and cosmology ( mcquinn et al .  2006 ; wyithe , loeb & geil  2008 ; chang et al .",
    "2007 ; mao et al .  2008 ; loeb & wyithe  2008 ; pritchard & loeb  2008 ; wyithe  2008 )",
    ".    the first generation of low frequency radio arrays will have low spatial resolution , and insufficient sensitivity to detect individual dlas in emission . on the other hand ,",
    "the redshifted 21 cm emission is sensitive to the total ( mass - weighted ) optical depth of this neutral gas .",
    "observations of the redshifted 21 cm signal would therefore detect the total neutral hydrogen content in a volume of igm dictated by the observatory beam and frequency band - pass , and as a result each beam will contain the combined emission from a large number of dlas .",
    "it is important to note that observation of dlas via 21 cm surface brightness fluctuations would be fundamentally different from quasar absorption line studies .",
    "the surface brightness fluctuations would be sensitive to the statistical properties of the population ( particularly the clustering ) , but could not be used to study individual dlas .",
    "although the 21 cm emission after hii overlap is dominated by dense clumps of gas rather than by diffuse gas in the igm as is the case before reionization is complete , we do not expect 21 cm self absorption to impact the level of 21 cm emission .",
    "this conclusion is based on 21 cm absorption studies towards dlas at a range of redshifts between @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which show optical depths to absorption of the back - ground quasar flux with values less than a few percent ( kanekar & chengalur 2003 ; curran et al .",
    "the small optical depth for self absorption is also supported by theoretical calculations of the 21 cm optical depth of neutral gas in high redshift mini - halos ( furlanetto & loeb  2002 ) .",
    "moreover , dlas have a spin temperature that is large relative to the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation , and will therefore have a level of emission that is independent of the kinetic gas temperature ( e.g. kanekar & chengalur 2003 ) .",
    "these factors combine to make prediction of the 21 cm signal from dlas robust against poorly understood astrophysical details of galaxy formation .    in this paper",
    "we consider the ps of 21 cm intensity fluctuations due to dla systems at @xmath27 where there are complementary quasar absorption line studies (   [ secdlaps ] ) .",
    "we show that the clustering could be accurately determined using low - frequency radio telescopes currently under construction (   [ sensitivity ] ) , and that this clustering will allow for an accurate measurement of the dla mass (   [ dla]-[psmu ] ) .",
    "we summarise our conclusions in   [ conclusion ] . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt the set of cosmological parameters based in part of data from _ wmap3 _",
    "( spergel et al . 2007 ) for a flat @xmath28cdm universe .",
    "we begin by describing the 21 cm ps following the completion of reionization .",
    "the amplitude of fluctuations in the 21 cm signal depends on the mass - averaged neutral hydrogen fraction in the igm , and on the clustering bias of dla systems .",
    "the latter is related to the galaxy bias of the dla host dark matter halos .",
    "if more massive halos tend to house more neutral hydrogen , we would expect there to be a mean relation between dla column density and the host halo mass .",
    "however dla systems have a range of column densities , and so we would also expect significant scatter around this mean relation , both because of variation in the hi content from galaxy to galaxy , and because the column density for a particular galaxy will depend on the line - of - sight probed by a particular observation .",
    "in addition , there is a small contribution to the neutral hydrogen content of the igm from lyman limit systems and the ly@xmath0 forest .    for a dla host with halo mass @xmath29",
    ", the galaxy bias @xmath30 may be approximated using the press - schechter  ( 1974 ) formalism ( mo & white  1996 ) , modified to include non - spherical collapse ( sheth , mo & tormen  2001 ) @xmath31,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . here",
    "@xmath37 is the variance of the density field smoothed on a mass scale @xmath29 at redshift @xmath38 .",
    "this expression yields an accurate approximation to the halo bias determined from n - body simulations ( sheth , mo & tormen  2001 ) .",
    "our approach to computing the dla ps is to assume that there is a probability distribution @xmath39 for the neutral hydrogen mass - weighted clustering bias ( @xmath30 ) of dlas relative to the underlying dark matter .",
    "this distribution has a mean @xmath40 , and a characteristic mass @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "the quantity @xmath40 is the typical galaxy bias of halos hosting neutral hydrogen .",
    "since dlas dominate the neutral hydrogen mass , and are thought to reside in massive , biased halos , we refer to this typical bias in the 21 cm ps as the bias of dla hosts , and @xmath41 as the dla host mass throughout this paper .",
    "our goal is to discuss the statistical precision with which @xmath41 can be determined via the 21 cm ps . as noted above , while most neutral hydrogen is located in the dlas , a fraction of hi in the igm is observed in ly - limit systems with column densities below @xmath43@xmath3 .",
    "if these systems are found in the same host halo population as the dlas , then @xmath41 will faithfully represent the dla host mass . on the other hand ,",
    "if ly - limit systems are located in smaller less biased halos , then equation  ( [ dlapslin ] ) will lead to an underestimate of the dla host mass .",
    "we do not expect this underestimate to be significant because the contribution to the observed ps is weighted by the the hi mass density squared and the bias squared , with dla systems dominating both quantities .",
    "assuming that the relation between hi and halo mass is independent of large scale over density ( and hence ionizing background ) , the 21 cm ps due to dlas ( wyithe  2008 ) is @xmath44 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the mass weighted neutral fraction of hydrogen in the universe .",
    "the ps is evaluated at a wavenumber @xmath46 with modulus @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the angle between the line - of - sight and wave - number @xmath46 . in deriving this expression",
    "we have assumed @xmath50 , as is observed following the completion of reionization .",
    "the peculiar motion induced anisotropy is dependent on cosmology through the evolution of growth factor @xmath51 via @xmath52 , and follows from application of redshift space distortions ( kaiser 1987 ) to the 21 cm ps .",
    "we assume @xmath53 , which is appropriate at high redshift . from equation  ( [ dlapslin ] )",

    "importantly , the ps is sensitive only to the first moment of @xmath58 . as a result",
    ", we do not need to calculate ( or assume ) a functional form for this distribution in order to estimate the constraints on @xmath41 .",
    "examples of spherically averaged power - spectra are plotted in figure  [ fig1 ] ( thick grey lines ) assuming values of @xmath59 corresponding to dla halo masses of @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( bottom to top ) , at each of the redshifts @xmath63 , 3.5 , 4.5 and 5.5 . we have assumed @xmath64 in these models corresponding to observations of hi density in dlas at high redshift ( prochaska et al .  2005 ) .",
    "the wiggles at wave numbers @xmath65mpc@xmath66 are the baryonic oscillations that are familiar to galaxy redshift surveys ( eisenstein et al .",
    "2005 ) . the models with larger dla host mass yield fluctuations with significantly more power , owing to the larger galaxy bias .",
    "it is this variation in the power that enables measurement of the dla host mass .",
    "as an example of the sensitivity of forthcoming low - frequency telescopes to the fluctuations in 21 cm emission after reionization , we have estimated the signal - to - noise for the murchison - widefield array ( mwa ) .",
    "calculations of the sensitivity to the 21 cm ps for an interferometer of this sort have been presented by a number of authors .",
    "we follow the procedure outlined by mcquinn et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , drawing on results from bowman , morales & hewitt  ( 2006 ) for the dependence of the array antenna density on radius @xmath67 .",
    "the uncertainty in a measurement of the ps per mode in the survey volume has two separate components , due to the thermal noise of the instrument ( @xmath68 ) , and due to sample variance within the finite volume of the survey ( @xmath69 ) .",

    "the noise due to sample variance therefore depends both on the survey volume and on dla host mass .",

    "( 2006 ) , we set @xmath78 if @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the co - moving length corresponding to the line - of - sight distance over which foregrounds can be removed .",
    "the number of modes observed depends on the volume of the survey , @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the total physical surface area of an antenna , and @xmath51 is the co - moving distance to the redshift of emission .",

    "note that only redshifts @xmath83 are accessible with the mwa antennae design .",
    "when complete , the mwa will comprise a phased array of 512 tiles ( each tile will contain 16 cross - dipoles ) distributed over an area with diameter 1.5 km . to compute the noise on the ps we model the antennae distribution as having @xmath84 with a maximum radius of 750 m and a finite density core of radius 18 m .",
    "we assume a 1000hr integration on each of 3 fields , and a foreground removed bandpass of @xmath85mhz within a total processed bandpass of 32mhz .",
    "the sensitivity to the 21 cm ps is dependent on both the sensitivity of the telescope to a particular mode , and to the number of such modes in the survey .",
    "the former is set by the effective collecting area ( @xmath86 ) of each antenna element ( as well as the total number of antennae ) , while the latter is sensitive to the total physical area covered by each antenna ( which we refer to as @xmath82 ) .",
    "this issue is discussed in more detail in wyithe , loeb & geil  ( 2008 ) . in computing the sensitivity",
    "we have assumed @xmath87m@xmath88 and @xmath89m@xmath88 ( corresponding to the design of the mwa ) .",
    "the combined uncertainties include the minimum @xmath47 cutoff due to foreground subtraction .",
    "comparison of the noise estimate with the expected 21 cm signal shows that the mwa could detect the ps at @xmath90 with high significance provided that the dla hosts are sufficiently massive ( and therefore biased ) .      at values of @xmath91 a few @xmath92 mpc@xmath66 , the measurement of the ps using the mwa will be limited by the thermal sensitivity of the array , and so the signal - to - noise achievable in this regime will be greatly enhanced by a subsequent generation of telescopes with larger collecting area . as an example we consider a hypothetical followup telescope to the mwa which would comprise 10 times the total collecting area .",
    "we refer to this followup telescope as the mwa5000 . the design philosophy for the mwa5000 would be similar to the mwa , and we therefore assume antennae distributed as @xmath93 with a diameter of 2 km and a flat density core of radius 80 m ( see mcquinn et al .",

    "we assume the antennae design to be optimised at the redshift of observation ( in which case we assume @xmath94 ) .",
    "in figure  [ fig1 ] we present estimates for measurement uncertainty of the 21 cm ps using mwa5000 ( thin dashed lines ) .",
    "an mwa5000 would achieve a high signal - to - noise detection of the ps , even in cases where the dla hosts have a small value of galaxy bias .          in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we show the integrated signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath95 ) for detection of the spherically averaged ps as a function of dla host mass .",

    "these dla systems will produce 21 cm intensity fluctuations , whose power - spectrum has an amplitude that depends both on the total mass of neutral hydrogen within the dla systems ( @xmath124 ) , and the masses of the dla host halos ( through galaxy bias ) .",
    "since @xmath124 is measured via quasar absorption line studies , we show that measurement of the spherically averaged 21 cm power - spectrum amplitude at @xmath135 could be used to determine the dla host mass . using a telescope of collecting area equal to the mwa",
    ", the dla host mass could be determined to within a factor as small as @xmath136 ( provided the hosts were massive galaxies ) , with the accuracy limited by the determination of @xmath124 in this case .    in observations of the 21 cm power - spectrum with high signal - to - noise ,",
    "the limitation of the quasar absorption line derived neutral fraction could be removed by including the observed angular dependence due to peculiar motions in the analysis . in this case",
    "the measurement of dla host mass would be limited by the sensitivity to the 21 cm power - spectrum , and future telescopes with larger collecting area would significantly increase the precision ( to within a few 10s of percent ) with which the dla host mass could be determined .",
    "the dla host mass is currently estimated via clustering analyses of absorption systems which are very rare , only being found in one of every few quasar lines of sight .",
    "thus measurement of the 21 cm power - spectrum , which measures the clustering of all dlas in a large volume , has the potential to greatly increase the precision with which the dla host mass is known .",
    "since dlas are thought to host the majority of gas available for star formation , measurement of the dla host mass will be a valuable contribution to our understanding of galaxy formation and the star formation history ."
