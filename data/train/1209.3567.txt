    "one of the most interesting questions in general relativity concerns the inner structure of black holes . however , it is hard to give a definite answer to this question because of the existence of a spacetime singularity where the curvature diverges indefinitely and general relativity breaks down .",
    "penrose and hawking proved that the gravitational collapse with physically reasonable initial conditions inevitably leads to the formation of a singularity , known as the singularity theorems @xcite .",
    "although such singularities are supposed to be concealed by the event horizon and to be isolated from the domain of predictability , this means that we can not describe the entire spacetime by the present physics .",
    "however , there may be situations where some of the assumptions in the singularity theorem may not be applied , such as the existence of the cosmological constant somewhere in the spacetime region .",
    "thus , it is of interest if we can construct some models of black holes without spacetime singularities .",
    "black holes having the regular centers are called regular black holes or nonsingular black holes .",
    "existing regular black hole solutions may be divided into two classes .",
    "solutions belonging to one class are characterized by the property that the black hole spacetime is sufficiently smooth everywhere .",
    "bardeen gave this type of a solution for the first time @xcite .",
    "the metric of his solution asymptotically approaches the de sitter and the reissner - nordstrm solutions in the limit of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , where @xmath11 is a schwarzschild - type radial coordinate .",
    "if one chooses appropriate parameters for the bardeen solution , its spacetime has two horizons and looks like a reissner - nordstrm black hole with a regular center . although it was thought that the bardeen solution can not be an exact solution of einstein equations , ayn - beato and garcia @xcite showed that the bardeen solution is given as a gravitational field coupled to a nonlinear magnetic monopole .",
    "so far , there have been many investigations based on bardeen s work for uncharged cases @xcite and for charged cases @xcite .",
    "the other class of regular black hole solutions is composed of the solutions constructed by matching two distinct spacetimes with a thin transition layer or surface .",
    "typical solutions of this class are composed of a single regular de sitter core and exterior black hole spacetime between which a single thin shell exists @xcite",
    ". the layer , which must be located within the event horizon because we consider the regular black hole , can be either a spacelike @xcite , timelike @xcite or null hypersurface @xcite .",
    "the regular uncharged spherically symmetric black holes @xcite are motivated by the assumption that the spacetime curvature has an upper limit which is of the order of the planck scale and the quantum effects become dominant so that the formation of the singularity is avoided .",
    "the collapsing matter will turn into a de sitter phase when the curvature approaches a critical value .",
    "this idea was first suggested for the cosmological context by sakharov @xcite and gliner @xcite .",
    "as mentioned before , studies on the regular black holes are closely related to matching problems of two different spacetimes and motion of the thin shell .",
    "israel derived convenient matching conditions of spacetimes for non - null transition layers  @xcite .",
    "barrabs and israel generalized israel s junction conditions to a unified description including null hypersurface cases @xcite .",
    "( for the spherically symmetric cases , see ref .",
    "@xcite . ) as for motion of the shell , gravitational collapse of a charged shell has been studied in refs .",
    "( for the cases of higher dimensional spacetimes and other gravitational theory , see , e.g. , refs . @xcite . ) in those studies , the interior spacetime of the shell is assumed to be flat @xcite or the reissner - nordstrm solution with different mass and charge from outside one @xcite . as argued in those studies",
    ", the shell can be stationary and stable only if the shell has pressure . in cases of no pressure ,",
    "the shell keeps on collapsing or expanding , or the shell collapsing ( expanding ) at the beginning will turn to expand ( collapse ) .",
    "stability of regular black holes is also important because unstable solutions can not occur in nature . for the regular black holes with shells , instability of the stationary shell immediately implies instability of the regular black hole .",
    "balbinot and poisson @xcite have analyzed stability of spacelike shells of the uncharged spherically symmetric regular black holes considered by frolov _",
    "they showed that for a certain parameter , the shell can be stationary and stable . in this study",
    ", we will apply balbinot and poisson s method to the cases of charged regular black holes ; the regular black holes consist of a timelike massive charged shell which separates the de sitter and the reissner - nordstrm spacetime inside the inner horizon of the reissner - nordstrm solution .",
    "lemos and zanchin have considered this type of charged regular black holes and obtained exact solutions assuming the shell is massless and pressureless @xcite .",
    "our aim in this study is threefold ; to find new regular black hole solutions having a massive thin shell , to examine their stability , and to examine stability of lemos and zanchin s regular black holes .",
    "for simplicity , we assume the shell is constructed of dust , i.e. , the shell has mass but no pressure .",
    "although the shell is pressureless in this study , we consider the de sitter spacetime inside the shell , i.e. , there exists matter that corresponds to a cosmological constant inside the shell .",
    "thus , the pressureless shell can be in stationary states .",
    "balbinot and poisson @xcite considered that the de sitter horizon is of the order of the planck scale and it is much smaller than the event horizon .",
    "however , we do not _ a priori _ make any assumptions for physical scales of the parameters regarding the regular black hole in this study .",
    "the plan of this paper is the following . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly describe formalism for a thin shell using the 3 + 1 decomposition of einstein equations and derive equations of motion for a thin dust shell . in sec .",
    "iii , we show results of new regular black hole solutions and their stability .",
    "stability of lemos and zanchin s regular black holes is argued in sec .",
    ", the conclusion is in the last section . throughout this paper ,",
    "we use the units of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively .",
    "as mentioned before , we consider solutions of einstein equations in which two different exact solutions , the de sitter and reissner - nordstrm solutions , are matching by a massive thin shell . following ref.@xcite , in this subsection , we concisely describe the formalism treating motion of the thin shell sandwiched between two arbitrary solutions .",
    "let @xmath15 be the four dimensional spacetimes that have metrics @xmath16 and a system of coordinates @xmath17 .",

    ", it is useful to rewrite the basic equations in the three - dimensional form .",
    "these equations can be derived by contracting the four - dimensional quantities by @xmath22 and/or @xmath24 . by using the einstein tensor",
    "@xmath33 contracted by @xmath22 and/or @xmath24 , and the gauss - codazzi equations , we obtain    & -2 g _",

    "@xmath38 is evaluated on @xmath18 by taking limit from @xmath15 .",
    "then , the energy - momentum conservation equation on the hypersurface will yield s^a _ b ; a + = 0 . [ dsa ]",
    "so far , we have shown the energy - momentum conservation equation in the general form .",
    "we next show how these equations are given for the dust shell .",
    "if the shell is composed of dust , the stress - energy tensor of the shell is given by s_ab = u_a u_b , where @xmath39 is the surface energy density of the shell and @xmath40 is the matter velocity on @xmath18 if the shell is a timelike hypersurface .",
    "thus , the energy - momentum conservation leads to ( u^a ) _ ; a = [ t _ u^ n^ ] , [ ene ] where @xmath41 is the four - velocity of the shell given by @xmath42 .",
    "the transverse acceleration of the shell is expressed by a^ u^ _",
    "| u^= u^a _ ; b u^b e^ _ a + u^a u^bk_a b n^. we are interested in the normal component of @xmath43 , which describes the motion of the shell .",
    "it is straightforward to see that @xmath44 = u^a u^b [ k_{ab}]$ ] .",
    "equation is equivalent to = 8 ( s_ab - h_ab ) , s = h_ab s^ab .",
    "[ ktos ] then , we have an equation of motion of the shell , n _ a^|",
    "a^| ^- = 4 .",
    "[ eom1 ] we may also construct an equation from the arithmetic means of the extrinsic curvatures , @xmath45 .",
    "however , it is not a useful equation for the present situation .      in order to have a regular center by matching the de sitter and the black hole spacetimes with a massive thin shell ,",
    "at least two horizons including extremal cases , in which two horizons coincide , are required @xcite . for uncharged spherically symmetric cases ,",
    "since the schwarzschild black hole , which is the outer solution for this situation , has a single horizon ( event horizon ) , the second horizon must be the de sitter one .",
    "this implies that the shell has to be located between the outer event horizon and the inner de sitter horizon and that it necessarily has to be spacelike . for charged and/or rotating cases ,",
    "the black hole solution has double horizons , the event and cauchy ( inner ) horizons .",
    "we may , therefore , choose any type of shell  timelike , spacelike , or null . since it is physically natural to assume that the shell is a timelike hypersurface",
    ", we choose the shell to be located inside the inner horizon of the black hole solution in these cases .",
    "assuming @xmath20 and @xmath21 to be the reissner - nordstrm and de sitter spacetimes , respectively , we apply the formalism given in the previous subsection to the present situation .",

    "to obtain values of @xmath6 , we use eq . after obtaining solutions of the regular black hole .",

    "values of @xmath93 and @xmath5 are kept constant .",
    "thus , the two algebraic equations , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , contain only two unknown parameters , @xmath48 and @xmath2 .",

    "thus , we show the results of the @xmath100 case as well in this study ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it is helpful to examine properties of the effective potential @xmath101 in order to understand how the regular black hole solution is obtained . in figs .",

    "thus , one sees that these potentials permit the stationary solutions .    to investigate basic properties of the regular black hole solutions ,",
    "we calculate many sequences of stationary solutions .",
    "the sequences of stationary solutions are specified by a fixed parameter @xmath5 , and are obtained by increasing a parameter @xmath109 from a minimum value @xmath110 ( see , also , the first paragraph of this section ) . in other words , they are given as a set of functions @xmath111 and @xmath112 with a fixed parameter @xmath5 .",

    "5 ) , and ( q / m ) s are decreasing functions of @xmath6 ( see fig",
    ". 6 ) . for high @xmath5 sequences of the solutions , values of @xmath48 approach unity ( see fig .",
    "it is important to point out that all the solutions obtained in this study satisfy @xmath113 , i.e. , they are highly charged , and that some solutions are nearly extreme in the sense @xmath114 at one end of the sequences of the solution ( see fig .",
    "6 ) .    as shown in our numerical results argued so far , the regular black hole solutions are only found in some restricted parameter regions .",
    "thus , it is useful to show clearly in which parameter regions the regular black hole solutions with a timelike thin shell occur . in figs . 7 and 8 , we show two - dimensional parameter regions where regular black hole solutions are found in this study .",
    "stable and unstable solutions are found in @xmath115 with positive @xmath6 and in @xmath116 with negative @xmath6 , respectively ( see fig .",
    "7 ) . as can be observed in fig .",
    "7 , the maximum value of @xmath6 @xmath117 for the solutions obtained in this study is achieved by the solution with the minimum value of @xmath5 @xmath118 . from fig .",
    "8 , it is observed that the radius of the shell is in the range @xmath119 for the solutions obtained . in the present study",
    ", we find no upper limit of @xmath5 for existing unstable regular black hole solutions .",
    "note that we show results of unstable solutions only for the range of @xmath120 in fig .",
    "7 , but @xmath121 does not mean the upper limit . for the cases of @xmath122 , we can not determine the minimum value of @xmath93 for unstable solutions because of numerical difficulties .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , one of our aims in this study is to analyze the stability of the charged regular black holes with a massless thin shell derived by lemos and zanchin @xcite . in order to investigate regular black holes with a massless thin shell",
    ", we may consider the limit of @xmath123 in our formalism .",
    "we focus on the @xmath3 case in this section since the @xmath100 case is not physically acceptable in usual situations .",

    "thus , we may exclude the @xmath100 case for our physical interests . in the @xmath123 limit ,",
    "the effective potential @xmath101 and its first derivative @xmath124 are approximated by    @xmath125    thus , we may obtain stationary solutions in the limit of @xmath123 if the following conditions are satisfied : @xmath126 we then assume that charged regular black hole solutions in the massless limit may be expanded in terms of @xmath6 as follows , @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are functions independent of @xmath6 . substituting eqs . and into @xmath101 and @xmath124 , we obtain @xmath130 then , stationary solutions in the limit of @xmath123 are , in terms of @xmath131 and @xmath4 , given by @xmath132 where quantities indicated by the subscript @xmath133 correspond to stationary solutions in the limit of @xmath123 . from the conditions for the regular black hole with a timelike thin shell , @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 , we obtain a constraint for @xmath131 , given by @xmath137 . these massless limit solutions , given by eqs . and , are exactly the same as those given by lemos and zanchin , although our notation is different form theirs .",

    "note that as can be seen from eqs . and , the massless limit solutions break down when @xmath143 .",
    "this is because as @xmath143 , the shell becomes lightlike , for which the present formalism for the timelike shell is not applicable .",
    "the above results show that in the limit of @xmath123 , the solutions exist only for @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 .",

    "these analyses show that lemos and zanchin s regular black hole solutions , given by the massless limit of the present regular black hole solutions , permit stable solutions .",
    "this conclusion , however , is not a final one because a properly massless thin shell case is excluded in the present analysis and because we only consider an example of regular black hole solutions that coincide with lemos and zanchin s solution in a massless thin shell limit .",
    "thus , further analyses are required to draw a definite answer of whether lemos and zanchin s regular black hole solutions are stable or not .    comparing these analytic results discussed so far to numerical results given in the last section",
    ", we may guess the lower and upper limits of the physical quantities for the regular black hole model to exist for the case of @xmath156 .",
    "then , it may be conjectured that @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 for the stable regular black hole solutions ( see figs . 7 and 8) .",
    "finally , let us consider a physical scale of the stable regular black hole solutions we obtain in this study , which have not been specified so far .",
    "for the stability analysis of schwarzschild - type regular black holes in refs.@xcite , the de sitter horizon radius is assumed to be of the order of the planck scale and @xmath160 , where @xmath161 denotes the event horizon radius .",
    "thus , @xmath162 , where @xmath163 denotes the planck length .",
    "on the other hand , if we take the above assumption , i.e. , @xmath162 , our analysis , based on a classical approach , fails since the present solutions satisfy @xmath164 .",
    "since the curvature invariant of the de sitter spacetime is @xmath165 , if there exists an upper bound of the curvature and our analysis is valid , the upper bound of the curvature has to be smaller than that of the planck scale .",
