    "supersymmetry provides a well motivated framework for embedding and extending the standard model of strong and electroweak interactions ( sm ) : its boson  fermion symmetry resolves the hierarchy problem and allows one to consistently extrapolate the theory to high - energy .",
    "however , a long standing question remains : at what high - energy scale does the next level of structure reside .",
    "the answer depends in part on the manner in which supersymmetry breaking is mediated ( at a scale @xmath4 ) from some ( hidden ) sector in which supersymmetry is broken spontaneously to the sm ( observable ) sector .",
    "it also depends on whether the sm sector itself contains any additional structure , e.g. , sm @xmath5 @xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "it is possible that the mediation of supersymmetry breaking is carried out through the sm gauge interactions ( in which case there may not be a truly hidden sector in the sense that it interacts only gravitationally with the observable sector ) .",
    "finite gauge quantum corrections involving supermultiplets of postulated heavy ( vector - like ) matter which transform under the sm  _ the messengers _  generate the desired soft supersymmetry breaking ( ssb ) mass parameters in the low energy potential .",
    "one has in this case @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a scale of the order of magnitude of the masses of the messengers ( it is given by the ratio of a supersymmetry breaking mass - squared and a supersymmetry conserving mass ) and @xmath8 is a generic gauge coupling .",
    "this is the gauge - mediation framework @xcite .",
    "the physical high - energy scale in this case is set by @xmath9 gev , where @xmath10 is a typical ( sm ) superpartner mass .",
    "a clear benefit of this framework is the flavor universality of the sfermion @xmath11 spectrum , which comes about since the different @xmath12^{2}$ ] parameters are distinguished only by the respective gauge quantum numbers .",
    "this eliminates _ a priori _ many potentially dangerous sources of flavor changing neutral currents .",
    "the low - mediation scale @xmath13 gev renders negligible , in most cases , any supergravity effects and hence eliminates various supergravity schemes for the generation of the @xmath0-parameter  the supersymmetry conserving dirac mass which mixes the two higgs doublets of the supersymmetric extension ( ssm ) @xmath14 .",
    "hence , the @xmath0 problem , why @xmath15 rather than @xmath16 , resurfaces in this case .",
    "( the non - observation of chargino pairs at the @xmath17 threshold implies that @xmath18 , and in particular , that it can not vanish @xcite . ) one can consider the possibility that the dimension - one @xmath0-parameter is generated by yukawa quantum corrections which involve some messenger fields which interact with the higgs doublets of the ssm via yukawa couplings @xmath19 .",
    "however , if this were the case then it is straightforward to show @xcite that a dimension - two ssb mixing between @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the scalar potential @xmath22 would also be generated and at the same loop order . unlike in the case of gauge loops , dimension one and two parameters generated by yukawa loops",
    "are typically suppressed by the same power of the loop factor . as a result @xmath23 ( or equivalently , @xmath24 ) .",
    "it reintroduces a hierarchy problem to the higgs potential which would be dominated in this case by @xmath25 .",
    "this is a most severe problem that undermines any success of the gauge - mediation framework .",
    "the most successful attempts to address this new hierarchy problem involve in one fashion or another the details of the high - energy ( supergravity ) theory , and in that sense they are high - energy solutions .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite invokes a radiative linear term generated by messenger - scale singlet interactions .",
    "the linear term shifts a singlet field @xmath26 ( which interacts with the higgs doublets ) to a scale which is suppressed by a loop factor in comparison to the messenger scale .",
    "the shifts in the scalar and auxiliary components of @xmath26 , which induce @xmath0 and @xmath27 respectively , arise at different loop orders , evading the above described hierarchy problem . the superpotential ( or equivalently",
    " the k \" ahler potential ) couplings must be fixed by the high - energy ( @xmath28 ) theory .",
    "in particular , a scale associated with a tree - level linear term must be fixed to be @xmath29 .",
    "alternatively , in ref .  @xcite it was pointed out that a radiative linear term in a singlet field @xmath26 is typically generated by supergravity and is suppressed by only one inverse power of the planck mass @xmath30 .",
    "hence , it can still play an important role in the low - energy theory .",
    "it shifts the singlet field @xmath31 ( assuming @xmath32 ) .",
    "the singlet yukawa interaction with the higgs doublets then generates the desired parameters at tree - level @xmath33 ( assuming that supersymmetry is broken at a scale of the order of @xmath34 gev ) . in this case",
    "no new scales are introduced by hand , but there is still dependence on the high - energy theory .",
    "( a somewhat similar application of supergravity to the problem was proposed in ref .",
    "both solutions assume the presence of a `` dedicated '' messenger - scale gauge singlet(s ) , denoted above by @xmath26 .    here",
    ", we point out a distinctive possibility that the singlet field is not a gauge singlet but only a sm singlet @xmath35 . specifically , we assume the extension @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath36 @xmath5 @xmath1@xmath2 , and that @xmath35 carries a charge @xmath38 under the additional abelian symmetry so that a yukawa term @xmath39 is allowed . in turn , a scale @xmath40 , which is associated with the breaking of the @xmath1@xmath2 , must be introduced , or preferably , induced .",
    "the various @xmath0 problems of gauge mediation will be shown to be solved in this case by the low - energy dynamics associated with this new scale .",
    "the scale @xmath41 could be generated radiatively and is a function in this case of @xmath7 and of @xmath42 yukawa couplings .",
    "a coupling between @xmath35 and exotic quarks , e.g. , @xmath43 and @xmath44 singlets with hypercharge @xmath45 , generates negative corrections to @xmath46 so that @xmath47 and @xmath35 acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "this is essentially a @xmath1@xmath2 version of the well - known radiative symmetry breaking ( rsb ) mechanism that is responsible in the ssm for the generation of the negative mass term in the sm higgs potential .",
    "a similar idea was suggested previously in the context of supergravity and high - energy ( gravity ) mediation ( @xmath48 ) of supersymmetry breaking @xcite . in that case , like rsb in those models , the large evolution interval enables one to render @xmath49 somewhere above the weak scale . in the supergravity case",
    "the superpotential interactions generate @xmath50 while trilinear ssb terms",
    "@xmath51 generate @xmath52 .",
    "since all parameters in the gravity - mediation framework are of the same order of magnitude as the gravitino mass ( which is fixed @xmath53 ) , then @xmath54 is expected to be of the same order of magnitude as well .",
    "this leads to a successful solution to the @xmath0-problem in high - energy supergravity models .",
    "various other solutions that benefit from the large mediation scale are also available in the supergravity framework @xcite .",
    "the radiatively broken @xmath1@xmath2 scenario was extensively studied in the framework of supergravity and of string - inspired models @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the supergravity framework , in gauge mediation the evolution interval is short ; in addition , trilinear parameters are highly suppressed parameters were proposed , however , in ref .  @xcite . ] @xmath55 . while the small @xmath56 parameters remain a constraint , the shorter evolution interval is more than compensated ( as for the case of rsb in these models ) by the large hierarchy within the ssb parameters @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 are the @xmath59 , and @xmath3 gauge couplings ) .",
    "in fact , the messengers may not transform under @xmath3 , in which case @xmath60 . for @xmath61 , which we will assume , the exact boundary condition for @xmath46 does not affect our discussion and for simplicity we assume hereafter that the messengers are indeed invariant under @xmath3 .",
    "a radiatively induced @xmath62 as a source of @xmath0 in the case of a gauge singlet @xmath35 was considered previously in the context of gauge mediation  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the singlet must couple to exotic quarks with large yukawa couplings , as naturally occurs in the context of @xmath1@xmath2 . in the gauge singlet case , however , the superpotential must contain a @xmath63 term so that the potential contains quartic terms @xmath64 which stabilize it .",
    "the models suffer from the usual problem of a spontaneously broken global @xmath65 symmetry ( under which @xmath63 is invariant ) which results in unacceptable domain walls at a ( post - inflationary ) low - energy epoch . in the gauged case @xmath35",
    "is not a singlet and @xmath63 terms are not gauge invariant and are automatically forbidden .",
    "instead , the potential is stabilized by @xmath1@xmath2 gauge @xmath43-terms @xmath66 ( which are not available for a gauge singlet @xmath35 ) .",
    "the @xmath65 symmetry is now only a ( harmless ) subgroup of the gauged @xmath3 .",
    "while in the non - gauged case the former source of the quartic terms also generates an additional contribution to @xmath67 , this is not possible in the gauged case ( with only one singlet ) .    in either the gauged or non - gauged case",
    ", the potential also exhibits an approximate phase ( @xmath68 ) symmetry , which exists in models with only yukawa superpotential terms and corresponds to a rotation of all fields by the same phase .",
    "it is broken spontaneously by @xmath62 and explicitly by tri - linear @xmath56-terms .",
    "the explicit breaking is , however , suppressed by the smallness of the @xmath56-parameters .",
    "we will show below that in spite of the suppressed @xmath56-parameters it is possible to generate @xmath27 and break the phase symmetry strongly enough to avoid the light pseudo goldstone boson which otherwise appears . specifically , as will be shown below , it is very likely that in the @xmath1@xmath2 scenario @xmath69 and hence , @xmath70 is a geometric mean of a small parameter and a large vev .",
    "it implies a somewhat large value of @xmath71 .",
    "however , this typically occurs in gauge mediation as a result of rsb constraints in the presence of a heavy gluino  @xcite .",
    "the details depend strongly on the exotic quark spectrum and on the @xmath1@xmath2 charges , and some examples will be presented below .",
    "alternatively , in models with two singlets a superpotential term @xmath72 could be gauge invariant , and @xmath73 could generate an additional contribution to @xmath74 , just as in the non - gauged case .",
    "( note that in the non - gauged case the @xmath3 rotations  explicitly broken by the @xmath63 terms  correspond to global transformations and there is one additional pseudo goldstone boson . )",
    "it is particularly interesting to note that in the models with only one sm singlet there appear only two new phases which can be rotated away , and hence there are no new physical phases .",
    "this is because there is only one common phase to all gaugino mass and the radiatively - induced @xmath56 parameters , while the phase of @xmath27 is given in this case by the phases of @xmath0 and @xmath56 .",
    "hence , after @xmath68 and peccei - quinn rotations no physical phases appear in the soft parameters .",
    "this eliminates new contributions to cp violating amplitudes such as the electron dipole moment , which are flavor conserving and which generically appear at unacceptable levels even in gauge - mediation models @xcite .",
    "the stabilization due to the @xmath43-terms and the generation of the @xmath56 terms then open the door to new ( low - energy ) solutions to the @xmath0-problem in gauge mediation .",
    "the mechanism is quite different from that of the non - gauged case since the quartic coupling is given , in principle , by a fixed gauge coupling rather than by a free superpotential coupling ; @xmath75 must depend on overcoming the suppression of the tri - linear couplings @xmath56 ; and the scale @xmath62 is a physical scale with observable consequences .",
    "hence , it corresponds to a distinctive and interesting option and it will be explored in some detail below .",
    "the @xmath1@xmath2 models predict , in addition to the extra matter and the associated rich spectrum , an extra gauge boson , @xmath76 .",
    "the corresponding phenomenology is similar to that of any other model with @xmath76 , except that @xmath77 is large , given that @xmath78 is controlled by the large exotic quark ssb parameters .",
    "typically we find @xmath79 and with suppressed mixing with the ordinary @xmath80-boson .",
    "thus it decouples safely from electroweak physics @xcite .",
    "another interesting aspect of supersymmetric @xmath1@xmath2 models that repeats here is that the tree - level light higgs @xmath81 mass exceeds its usual upper bound of @xmath82 .",
    "this is due to contributions from the @xmath1@xmath2 @xmath43-terms to the quartic potential , which lift its otherwise flat direction .",
    "we find for its mass @xmath83 gev at tree level and @xmath84 gev at one loop .",
    "a most interesting aspect of the @xmath1@xmath2 scenario is that the gauge - mediation scale is still the only fundamental scale , and the @xmath1@xmath2 scale is determined from it .",
    "it has been proposed recently @xcite that perhaps the same @xmath1@xmath2 is also responsible for the actual mediation of supersymmetry breaking from the `` hidden '' sector to the messenger fields ( i.e. , to identify @xmath1@xmath2 with @xmath1@xmath85 of ref .",
    "this is an ambitious yet interesting proposal that significantly differs from our bottom - up approach , which , in principle , is independent of the details of supersymmetry breaking and its initial mediation to the messenger fields . by distinguishing the two extended interactions we avoid the need , e.g. , to fine tune yukawa couplings , which is the situation in ref .",
    "@xcite due to the multitude of tasks imposed there on a single @xmath1 .",
    "the only ( moderate ) hierarchy in yukawa couplings that is assumed is between those that involve ( exotic ) quarks , which are taken to saturate or be near their infra - red quasi - fixed points and be @xmath42 , and those which involve only the higgs doublets and the singlet(s ) , which do not reach any ( quasi-)fixed points and hence are taken to be smaller .",
    "such differences naturally stem from qcd renormalization , which enables the existence of quasi - fixed points for the ( exotic ) quark couplings .",
    "we describe the model in greater detail in the next section . in section iii",
    "we discuss the evolution of its parameters , the scalar potential , and the extraction of @xmath0 and @xmath27 in the two schemes .",
    "we summarize and comment on various issues such as unification in the last section . since our focus in this work is on the demonstration of the viability of the proposed low - energy solution to the @xmath0-problem in gauge mediation , some assumptions ( which are clearly indicated )",
    "were made in order to simplify the presentation and discussion ( mainly by fixing parameters whose variation was found to be immaterial for our purposes ) .",
    "also , only results for the higgs and neutralino / chargino sectors which significantly differ from the usual case will be presented in detail , though we checked that the complete spectrum is consistent .",
    "our presentation is within a one - scale model though generalizations are straightforward .",
    "our focus is on the low - energy theory below the messenger scale and on the generation of the @xmath1@xmath2 and electroweak scales as functions of this scale .",
    "we comment on implications for possible extrapolations to higher energies in our conclusions .",
    "the extended gauge symmetry of the model is @xmath86 , with the gauge couplings @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 respectively , and @xmath91 . the extended particle content is given by the left - handed chiral multiplets of the the minimal supersymmetric extension ( mssm ) including three families of quark doublets ( @xmath92 ) and singlets ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) , lepton doublets ( @xmath95 ) and singlets ( @xmath96 ) , and the higgs doublets @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , it contains exotic quark vector - like pairs , e.g. @xmath43 and @xmath44 pairs which are singlets under @xmath97@xmath98 and carry hypercharge @xmath99 , and fields which are singlets under the sm but are charged under @xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "we assume that all of the low - energy matter fields ( but not the messenger - scale fields ) are charged under @xmath1@xmath2 . for concreteness",

    "the @xmath101 symmetry is used as a classification tool only , i.e. , we do not assume a full grand unification .",
    "nevertheless , it enables one , in principle , to choose an anomaly free low - energy spectrum . in this study",
    "we include only a subset of fields which are relevant for the generation of the @xmath0 and @xmath27 parameters and only comment on the anomaly cancelation in our conclusions .",
    "also , in order to explore a wider range of possibilities , the @xmath100 assumption will be relaxed in certain cases , and we will vary the @xmath1@xmath2 charge assignments .",

    "the breaking of the supersymmetry is parameterized by the singlet @xmath104 , whose scalar component acquires a vev @xmath105 and auxiliary component @xmath106 a vev @xmath107 .",

    "the messenger scale is defined here as @xmath117 .",
    "the gaugino masses are generated at one - loop @xcite @xmath118 where @xmath119 , and @xmath120 is the dynkin index for @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "we choose , as is customary , a normalization such that the minimal @xmath121 model has @xmath122 . in particular , we assume embedding of the messengers @xmath123 , and is therefore inconsistent with a true @xmath101 embedding of the models , which we do not assume at this point . ] ( for simplicity only ) that the messenger fields are not charged under the additional @xmath1 , and hence , @xmath124 .",

    "( our results do not depend on this assumption . )",
    "the @xmath56 parameters arise only at the higher - loop order and are very small . in our study",
    "we take the @xmath56 parameters to be zero at the messenger scale .",
    "nevertheless , non - trivial values of the @xmath56 parameters arise from the one - loop renormalization - group evolution . assuming that the messenger fields @xmath108 and @xmath109 are not charged under the @xmath1@xmath2 , the gaugino of the @xmath1@xmath2 and the sm singlet fields are therefore massless at the messenger scale and @xmath109",

    "once @xmath3 is broken , its gaugino and gauge boson are degenerate in mass .",
    "we use the renormalization group equations ( rge ) to relate the boundary conditions for the ssb parameters at the messenger scale to their values at lower energies . as the first step , the scale at which the additional @xmath1@xmath2 is broken is determined and is required to be higher than the electroweak scale ( in order to be consistent with the experimental limits on the @xmath76 gauge boson ) . at this scale ,",
    "the exotic quarks acquire heavy masses and decouple from the theory . by iterating this procedure ,",
    "the gauge couplings at the messenger scale @xmath133 are determined from their well - known electroweak - scale values ( taking into account the contributions of the exotic matter ) . at the second step ,",
    "the values of @xmath0 ( or equivalently , @xmath134 ) and @xmath135 at the minimum of the higgs potential are determined , the former by fixing the mass of the @xmath80 boson and the latter by using the result for @xmath0 and @xmath136 .",
    "given @xmath137 , the yukawa couplings at the electroweak scale are determined from the respective fermion masses . the procedure is then iterated in order to determine the correct yukawa couplings for the @xmath138 and @xmath139 quarks and the @xmath140-lepton .",
    "the desired solution for the minimum of the higgs potential which correctly reproduces the @xmath80 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 masses is found and the @xmath76 mass and mixing , in addition to the sparticle spectrum , are predicted . given our assumptions , the free parameters in the analysis are @xmath7 , the number @xmath141 of @xmath43 , @xmath44 pairs that couple to @xmath35 , the corresponding yukawa couplings @xmath142 , and ( in the case of two sm singlets ) the singlet self - coupling . the product of @xmath141 and @xmath142 is constrained by electroweak breaking and also by requiring a sufficiently heavy @xmath76 .",

    "squark and gluino masses are again in the @xmath224 gev range and the nlsp is again the lightest neutralino .      as we discussed in sec .",
    "ii , the free parameters in our analysis are @xmath7 , @xmath142 and @xmath141 . in our numerical examples ,",
    "we choose @xmath225 gev . if @xmath7 is varied while the other parameters are kept fixed , the scale at which the @xmath1@xmath2 is broken changes so that @xmath226 is approximately a constant .",
    "for example , if we raise @xmath7 to be @xmath227 gev in the first example , the singlet vev becomes @xmath228 gev .",
    "this is because rsb depends on the evolution interval , and not on the actual location of the boundary .",
    "next , consider @xmath229 , the number of the exotic quarks that couple to the singlet field @xmath35 with coefficient @xmath230 .",
    "choosing a smaller @xmath231 and keeping @xmath7 and @xmath230 fixed , the @xmath1@xmath2 breaking scale is reduced , and the associated @xmath76 mass is diminished .",
    "for example , setting @xmath232 in the first example instead of @xmath183 , the singlet vev is now @xmath233 gev , resulting in @xmath234 gev with a mixing angle @xmath235 .",
    "in particular , with @xmath236 , @xmath237 is too small to generate a solution with @xmath238 gev ( which is a model dependent experimental lower bound ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath229 is fixed , increasing / decreasing @xmath230 will raise / lower the @xmath1@xmath2 scale and solutions for @xmath239 exist for larger values of @xmath142 .",
    "hence , it is the product of @xmath230 and @xmath229 which is constrained by the @xmath76 mass . note that an upper bound on the yukawa couplings @xmath240 exists only if one requires the model to still be perturbative at some high energy scale .",
    "also , the variation with @xmath141 discussed above is similar for different exotic quark quantum numbers ( for example , for two pairs of exotic quark singlets instead of an exotic quark doublet pair ) .    in our numerical analysis , we have identified , for simplicity , the messenger scale and the scale parameter @xmath7 which determines the boundary conditions for the soft mass parameters eqs .",
    "( [ gaugino ] ) and ( [ scalar ] ) .",
    "differentiating these two scales will not change our conclusions .",
    "for example , raising the boundary scale for the rge evolution in the first example to @xmath241 gev , while keeping @xmath242 gev in eqs .",
    "( [ gaugino ] ) and ( [ scalar ] ) leads to a solution with a larger singlet vev @xmath243 gev due to the longer evolution interval .",
    "the @xmath244 parameter is also larger in this case , @xmath245 gev , which results in a slightly smaller @xmath246 at the electroweak scale .",
    "it has been shown that a @xmath1@xmath2 scale may be generated naturally and radiatively one or two orders of magnitude below the messenger scale . upon integrating out the @xmath1@xmath2 sector ,",
    "the supersymmetry conserving ( @xmath0 ) and breaking ( @xmath27 ) dimensionful higgs mixing parameters are generated , resolving the @xmath0 problem in the otherwise attractive class of gauge - mediation models .",
    "a natural consequence of the models with only one singlet is that no new physical phases appear in the soft parameters , eliminating potentially unacceptable contributions to cp violating amplitudes which are flavor conserving and generically persist in gauge - mediation models .",
    "other implications include new contributions to the effective quartic coupling which lift the lightest higgs boson mass to @xmath247 gev .",
    "the @xmath1@xmath2 dynamics also adds to the already strong predictive power of the gauge - mediation framework , as the scalar , fermion and vector electroweak sectors are extended and new exotic matter is predicted at a few tev scale .",
    "the higgs , neutralino and chargino sectors are now extended and contain new degrees of freedom , but no new light pseudo goldstone bosons .",
    "the additional gauge boson typically has a @xmath248(tev ) mass and negligible mixing with the @xmath80-boson .",
    "its exact mass depends on the number of exotic quarks and on the strength of their yukawa couplings .",
    "we find the usual near equality between @xmath249 and the gluino mass that often appears in various variants of the mssm .",
    "the gluino is heavy , which is a generic prediction of the gauge - mediation framework , and hence it naturally leads to a relatively large value of @xmath0 . at the same time it implies that electroweak symmetry breaking exhibits in our case the typical gauge mediation tuning @xmath250 , rather than a new tuning due to the @xmath1@xmath2 dynamics .",
    "it is worth stressing that the higgs mixing parameter in the scalar potential @xmath251 ( in the one singlet case ) is a geometrical mean of the superpotential higgs mixing parameter @xmath0 and a radiatively generated ( small ) trilinear coupling @xmath252 . since @xmath0 is proportional to a large vev ( and the heavy gluino implies further that @xmath249 is not suppressed by a small coupling ) the geometrical mean @xmath253 gev is sufficiently large .    while we have focused on the low - energy aspects of this one - scale model , it is interesting to consider its embedding in a high - energy theory , and in particular a unified or string theory .",
    "unification of gauge couplings at planckian energies constrains the exotic matter which is charged under the sm to fall into complete multiplets of a unified group , e.g. , @xmath254 of @xmath112 .",
    "it further constrains the number of such extra pairs of multiplets , e.g. , @xmath255 @xcite .",
    "the counting now includes also the messenger multiplets but may be modified by various considerations such as the exact mass ( and hence , messenger ) scale , the presence of large yukawa couplings ( as in our case ) and the normalization of the @xmath1 factor(s ) .",
    "anomaly cancelation suggests that the sm , exotic multiplets ( and messengers - if charged under @xmath3 ) are embedded in @xmath256 multiplets of e@xmath257 .",
    "the most straightforward realization which is consistent with the anomaly constraints ( but which does not coincide with a standard @xmath101 model ) is that only the third family carries @xmath1@xmath2 charges , and the extra @xmath258 that are required for the anomaly cancelation correspond to one pair of exotics and to the usual higgs doublets .",
    "the messengers are also not charged under the @xmath1@xmath2 in this case .",
    "we have shown that such a model is consistent ( for a large yukawa coupling @xmath259 ) but generically predicts a lighter @xmath76 .",
    "this simple model , however , does not unify .",
    "unified ( and hence , automatically anomaly - free ) models require a more complicated embedding , typically contain more than one pair of exotic quarks , and further require some separation mechanism between the low - energy higgs doublets and the heavier exotic leptons which appear .",
    "such an embedding , however , is possible .",
    "an explicit example which satisfies all constraints ( including unification of couplings ) was given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another issue that may arise is the kinetic mixing between @xmath260 and @xmath3 .",
    "if at the fundamental scale , the mixed trace between @xmath260 and @xmath3 does not vanish , a term in the lagrangian that mixes the field strength of the two @xmath1 s could arise through loop corrections at the low energy scale . a non - orthogonal transformation of the gauge fields associated with the two @xmath1 s",
    "is required so that the kinetic energy terms can be written in their canonical forms .",
    "this transformation effectively shifts the @xmath3 charges of the particles while keeping their @xmath260 charges @xcite .",
    "the messengers in this case carry @xmath3 charges .",
    "it could also modify the low energy phenomenology .",
    "for example , the shifted charges for a specific model could be such that the low energy model is `` leptophobic '' , and hence allows a lighter @xmath76 . however , the size of the correction depends in detail on the particle content of the model and on the decoupling scales .",
    "kinetic mixing is again an ultra - violet effect ( which , however , vanishes in the limit @xmath261 ) and was not considered here in detail .",
    "lastly , we would like to comment that a straightforward extension of our mechanism can lead to lepton number violation thorough couplings @xmath262 if @xmath95 and @xmath20 carry the same @xmath1@xmath2 charge ( this is the case for the @xmath1@xmath263 of @xmath264 , but not for the other @xmath3 embeddings ) or more generally in a multi - singlet model .",
    "the case @xmath265 is in fact more attractive since it would forbid lepton number violating yukawa operators in the high - energy theory . since gauge mediation guarantees slepton - higgs mass universality , and higgs - slepton bilinear mixing in the scalar potential arises only from radiative @xmath56-parameters , then all conditions for the dynamical alignment suppression of neutrino masses outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite are automatically and naturally satisfied and gauge - mediation models would lead in this case to also a successful generation of neutrino masses .    in conclusion , the higgs mass parameters in the gauge - mediation framework are best understood as dynamical degrees of freedom corresponding to a ( sm ) singlet . here",
    ", it was suggested that such a singlet is not a gauge singlet but transforms under a @xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "while the minimal ( `` model - independent '' ) low energy framework was given and discussed , its many possible extensions and embeddings remain to be explored in greater detail .",
    "it is pleasure to thank h.  murayama and especially m.  cveti for discussions .",
