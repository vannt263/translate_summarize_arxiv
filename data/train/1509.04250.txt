    "the response of a grandstand can be resolved quite easily by linear dynamics methods , if we neglect all the randomness of the system . however , for a more accurate description , at least the most significant uncertainties need to be taken into account .",
    "the main uncertainties include    * forcing terms resulting from active crowd movements , especially synchronized jumping , * the uncertainties of the parameters in discrete biodynamic models  randomness of stiffness , mass and damping matrices , * the size and spatial distribution of an active crowd and a passive crowd .",
    "further generalizations can take into account various kinds of nonlinearities , e.g. geometrical and material non - linearities and non - linearities of biodynamic models @xcite .",
    "however , the following restrictions will be assumed for the purposes of this paper : the material parameters of the structure are treated as deterministic , since their influence is negligible in comparison with the sources listed above and the scope of the overall response ; the spatial distribution of the crowd is fixed ; biodynamic models of the passive crowd are treated as deterministic .    the results of measurements carried out on simple structures indicate that an active spectator might be represented as a time dependent force , _ cf _ @xcite . in other words , under certain circumstances ,",
    "an active spectator does not influence the properties of the structure .",
    "several generators of normalized artificial load processes have been developed in the literature , e.g. @xcite and @xcite , which can be supplemented by human body weights , e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , the passive part of the crowd is assumed to be stationary in space and in permanent contact with the structure , excluding accelerations that exceed the gravity of the earth .",
    "thus a passive spectator can be modeled as a biodynamic system .",
    "a survey of models of this type can be found in @xcite .",
    "these remarks allow us to model the structure considered here in terms of random vibrations of linear systems .",
    "monte carlo simulation ( mc ) is one of the ways used in advanced grandstand design procedures for reflecting all kinds of randomness .",
    "mc is a general method , but it has considerable disadvantages in its original form , e.g. rather slow convergence when estimating low probabilities , and high computational demands .",
    "mc will be employed in this paper mainly for controlling the accuracy and the performance of semi - analytical methods introduced in terms of stochastic differential equations .",
    "these simplified methods can be applicable and useful in the preliminary stages of design procedures , when quick and approximate solutions are sufficient .",
    "employing the finite element method , and taking into account the above - mentioned assumptions , a mathematical model of the structural system considered here can be written as a set of hyperbolic differential equations @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are @xmath3 and @xmath4-valued stochastic processes , and @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are @xmath9 and @xmath10 matrices of mass , damping , stiffness and input distribution .",

    "as will become apparent in section [ apptograndstands ] , under certain conditions process @xmath18 is approximately normal , and since differential equation ( [ 2eq3 ] ) is linear with deterministic coefficients , it is reasonable to accept gaussian approximation also for @xmath19 .",

    "<S> this paper presents a semi - analytical estimate of the response of a grandstand occupied by an active crowd and by a passive crowd . </S>",
    "<S> filtered gaussian white noise processes are used to approximate the loading terms representing an active crowd . lumped biodynamic models with a single degree of freedom are included to reflect passive spectators occupying the structure . </S>",
    "<S> the response is described in terms of the first two moments , employing the it formula and the state augmentation method for the stationary time domain solution . </S>",
    "<S> the quality of the approximation is compared on the basis of three examples of varying complexity using monte carlo simulation based on a synthetic generator available in the literature . for comparative purposes , there is also a brief review of frequency domain estimates .    </S>",
