    "neutrino masses , without which current neutrino oscillation data can not be understood  @xcite , are here to stay  @xcite .",
    "it has been long noted that small neutrino masses can arise from an effective dimension - five operator @xmath0 which may arise from unknown physics beyond that of the model . here",
    "@xmath1 denotes one of the three lepton doublets and @xmath2 is the standard model scalar doublet  @xcite .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking takes place through the nonzero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath3 such operator leads to majorana neutrino masses .",
    "in contrast to the charged fermion masses , which arise directly from the coupling of the scalar higgs , neutrino masses appear in second order in @xmath3 and imply by two units ( @xmath4 ) at some large scale .",
    "this fact accounts for the smallness of neutrino masses relative to those of the standard model charged fermions .",
    "this is all we can say from first principles about the operator @xmath5 in fig .  [",
    "fig : d5 ] . in general",
    "we have no clue on the _ mechanism _ giving rise to @xmath5 , nor its associated mass _ scale _ , nor the possible details of its _",

    "@xmath6    one may assume that @xmath5 is induced at the tree level by the exchange of heavy `` messenger '' particles , whose mass lies at a scale associated to the violation of the global lepton number symmetry by new physics , beyond that of the model , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is some unknown dimensionless constant .",
    "for example gravity , which in a sense `` belongs '' to the sm , could induce the dimension - five operator @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "in such a minimalistic scenario  @xcite the large scale @xmath9 in the denominator is the planck scale and hence the neutrino mass that results is too small to account for current neutrino oscillation data .",
    "hence we need genuine `` new physics '' in order to generate neutrino masses this way .",
    "neutral heavy leptons ( nhl ) arise naturally in several extensions of the standard model .",
    "their possible role as messengers of neutrino mass generation constitutes one of their strongest motivations and a key ingredient of the type - i seesaw mechanism  @xcite in any of its variants .",
    "if realized at the fermi scale  @xcite , it is likely that the `` seesaw messengers '' responsible for inducing neutrino masses would lead to a variety of phenomenological implications .",
    "these depend on the assumed gauge structure . here for definiteness and simplicity , we take the minimal structure which is well tested experimentally . in this case",
    "one can have , for example ,    1 .",
    "light isosinglet leptons are usually called `` sterile '' .",
    "if they lie in the ev range they could help accommodate current neutrino oscillation anomalies  @xcite by taking part in the oscillations .",
    "sterile neutrinos at or above the kev range might show as distortions in weak decay spectra  @xcite and be relevant for cosmology  @xcite .",
    "heavy isosinglet leptons below the z mass could have been seen at lep i  @xcite .",
    "likewise , tev nhls might be seen in the current lhc experiment , though in the latter case rates are not expected to be large in the theory .",
    "3 .   whenever nhl are too heavy to be emitted in weak decay .",
    "processes , the corresponding decay rates would decrease , leading to universality violation  @xcite .",
    "4 .   the admixture of nhl in the charged current weak interaction would affect neutrino oscillations , since they would not take part in oscillations .",
    "these would be effectively described by a non - unitary mixing matrix  @xcite .",
    "5 .   if majorana - type , nhl would modify rates for processes such as neutrinoless double beta ( @xmath10 ) decays through long - range ( mass mechanism ) , as well as induce short - range contributions  @xcite . 6 .",
    "nhl would induce charged processes  @xcite .",
    "however the corresponding restrictions depend on very model - dependent rates .    in what follows",
    "we consider the generic structure of the lepton mixing matrix relaxing the unitarity approximation  .",
    "we show that their most general form is factorizable , so that current experiments involving only electron and muon neutrinos or anti - neutrinos can be effectively described in terms of just three new real parameters and one new cp violation phase .",
    "we illustrate how these parameters affect oscillations and discuss the main restrictions on such generalized mixing structure that follow from universality tests . for logical completeness we also present a brief compilation of various model  independent constraints on nhl mixing parameters within the same parametrization , including those that follow from the possibility of direct nhl production at high energy accelerator experiments .",
    "isosinglet neutral heavy leptons couple in the weak charged current through mixing with the standard isodoublet neutrinos .",
    "the most general structure of this mixing matrix has been given in the symmetric parametrization in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we consider an equivalent presentation of the lepton mixing matrix which manifestly factorizes the parameters associated to the heavy leptons from those describing oscillations of the light neutrinos within the unitarity approximation . here",
    "we present its main features , details are given in the appendix  .    for the case of three light neutrinos and @xmath11 neutral heavy leptons",
    ", one can break up the matrix @xmath12 describing the diagonalization of the neutral mass matrix as  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a @xmath15 matrix in the light neutrino sector , while @xmath16 describes the coupling parameters of the extra isosinglet states , expected to be heavy ( for a perturbative expansion for @xmath12 see  @xcite ) . as shown in the appendix ,",

    "( [ eq : ndescopm_c1 ] ) provides a most convenient , general and complete description of the propagation of solar , atmospheric and terrestrial neutrinos from reactors , radioactive sources and accelerators beams , relaxing the unitarity approximation . due to the zeroes in the first two rows of the pre - factor matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ndescopm_c1 ] ) it is clear that the only extra parameters beyond those characterizing unitary mixing are four : the two real parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 plus the complex parameter @xmath23 which contains a single cp phase . indeed",
    "the existence  @xcite and possible effects  @xcite extra cp phases associated to the admixture of nhl in the charged leptonic weak interaction had already been noted in the early paper in  @xcite .",
    "the new point here is that , despite the proliferation of phase parameters , only one combination enters the `` relevant '' neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "this holds irrespective of the number of extra heavy isosinglet neutrino states present .",
    "other studies , such as  @xcite , appear as particular cases with a fixed number of extra heavy isosinglet neutrino states , any of which can be expressed in terms of the same set of parameters @xmath24 .",
    "similarly , the matrix u may be expressed in different ways , such as in pdg form or in our fully symmetric description , particularly useful for phenomenological analyses .",
    "the diagonal elements , @xmath25 , are real and expressed in a simple way as @xmath26 in terms of the cosines of the mixing parameters  @xcite , @xmath27 .",
    "now the off - diagonal terms @xmath23 and @xmath28 are expressed as a sum of @xmath11 terms @xmath29 where @xmath30 and its conjugate @xmath31 contain all of the cp violating phases .",
    "finally , by neglecting quartic terms in @xmath32 , with @xmath33 one finds a similar expression for @xmath34 , @xmath35 in summary , by choosing a convenient ordering for the products of the complex rotation matrices @xmath36 ( see appendix ) , one obtains a parametrization that separates all the information relative to the additional leptons in a simple and compact form , containing three zeroes .",
    "we will now concentrate on this specific parametrization .",
    "given the above considerations and the chiral nature of the model , we notice that the couplings of the @xmath37 neutrino states in the charged current weak interaction can be described by a rectangular matrix  @xcite @xmath38 with @xmath14 a @xmath19 matrix described by eq .",

    "the presence of extra heavy fermions that mix with the active light neutrinos would imply the effective non - unitarity of the @xmath15 light neutrino mixing matrix , hence modifying several sm observables .",
    "for example , note that the unitarity condition will take the form @xmath40 with @xmath41    we will show that , with the parametrization discussed here , one can , at least in principle , introduce all of the information of the extra @xmath11 states into the @xmath24 parameters in a simple compact form .",
    "the method is completely general and includes all the relevant cp phases . in what follows",
    "we will consider different direct or indirect tests of the existence of the extra heavy fermions , expressing the relevant observables in terms of these parameters , in order derive the relevant constraints .",
    "first one notes that if , as generally expected due to their gauge singlet nature , the heavy leptons can not be kinematically emitted in various weak processes such as muon or beta decays , these decays will be characterized by different effective fermi constants , hence breaking universality .",
    "one can now apply the above formalism in order to describe the various weak processes and to derive the corresponding experimental sensitivities .",
    "we first discuss the universality constraint , already reported in the literature  @xcite , in order to cast it within the above formalism . comparing muon and",
    "beta decays one finds @xmath42 and @xmath43 therefore , all the observables related to fermi constant will be affected by this change , for instance , the quark ckm matrix elements  @xcite . in particular , the ckm matrix elements @xmath44 and @xmath45 are proportional to @xmath46 .",
    "these matrix elements are measured in @xmath47-decay , @xmath48 decay , and hyperon decays . the effect on @xmath46 ,",
    "therefore , modifies @xmath49 and the unitarity constraint for the first row of the ckm is now expressed as  @xcite : @xmath50 where the eq .",
