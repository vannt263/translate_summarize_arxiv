    "they satisfy dglap evolution in the factorisation scale @xmath13 .",
    "however , for exclusive processes , parton distributions unintegrated over @xmath0 are more appropriate .",
    "the unintegrated distributions , @xmath14 , have the advantage that they exactly correspond to the quantity which enters the feynman diagrams and therefore allow for the true kinematics of the process at small @xmath11 , even at leading order ( lo ) .",
    "we will explain how the exact kinematics may be restored for general values of @xmath11 .",
    "the distributions depend on two hard scales , @xmath0 and @xmath13 , and so the evolution is much more complicated . for example , the gluon distribution @xmath15 satisfies the ccfm evolution equation @xcite based on angular ordering of gluon emissions along the chain , in the approximation where only the @xmath16 and @xmath17 singular terms of the splitting function @xmath18 are kept .",
    "so far , working with this equation has only proved possible with monte carlo generators @xcite .",
    "however , in ref .  @xcite it was shown that it is possible to obtain the two - scale unintegrated distributions , @xmath14 , using single - scale evolution equations for @xmath19 with the dependence on the second scale @xmath13 introduced only at the _ last step _ of the evolution .",
    "we call this the kmr procedure . two alternatives for the evolution of @xmath19 were considered : ( i ) pure dglap evolution and ( ii ) a unified evolution equation @xcite which embodies both the leading @xmath20 ( dglap ) and @xmath21 ( bfkl ) effects , as well as including a major part of the sub - leading @xmath21 contributions . as expected , the gluon and sea quark distributions , @xmath14 , extended into the @xmath22 region , and indeed populated this domain more and more as @xmath11 decreased .",
    "an interesting result was that the unintegrated distributions obtained via the unified evolution of prescription ( ii ) were not very different from those based on the simpler dglap evolution of ( i ) .",
    "it was concluded that the imposition of the angular - ordering constraint in the last step of the evolution was more important than including the bfkl effects .",
    "here , we pay particular attention to probing the unintegrated quark distribution at larger values of @xmath11 , so prescription ( i ) will certainly be a good approximation .",

    "@xcite angular ordering was imposed on both quark and gluon emissions ; we correct this and only impose angular ordering on gluon emissions .",

    "the most direct way to test the unintegrated parton distributions is via inclusive jet production in deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "inclusive jet production , particularly in the current jet region , probes the unintegrated quark distribution in a similar way that inclusive dis probes the integrated quark densities .",
    "the idea is that the lo diagram computed using @xmath1-factorisation will reproduce , to a good approximation , the results of the conventional lo qcd diagrams computed using collinear factorisation .",

    "it is convenient to use a sudakov decomposition of the 4-momenta of the propagator gluons : @xmath28 where @xmath10 is the 4-momentum of the proton and @xmath29 is a light - like 4-vector . here",

    "we neglect the proton mass since @xmath33 . in the breit frame @xmath34",
    "the emitted gluons along the chain have 4-momenta @xmath35 while the total 4-momentum going into the hard subprocess is @xmath36 since the outgoing partons must be on - shell ( @xmath37 ) , we have @xmath38 where @xmath39 , and the sudakov ( light - cone ) variables of the propagator gluons obey the ordering : @xmath40    colour coherence effects impose the angular ordering of the gluons emitted from the evolution chain , originating from the destructive interference between the gluon emission amplitudes . the angle between the direction of the emitted gluons , with 4-momentum @xmath41 , and the proton beam direction must increase as we move towards the hard subprocess at the top of the evolution ladder .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a variable @xmath42 .",
    "then the rapidities of the emitted gluons are @xmath43 and the angular ordering , @xmath44 is equivalent to an ordering in @xmath45 , @xmath46 where @xmath47 provides the maximum allowed angle @xmath48 via @xmath49 , assuming @xmath50 . from and , @xmath51 where we have defined the rescaled _ transverse _ momenta @xmath52 of the emitted gluons to be @xmath53 in angular - ordered ( or ccfm ) evolution , the factorisation scale @xmath13 plays the rle of the maximum rescaled transverse momentum , so @xmath54 .",

    "it is informative to review how unintegrated parton distributions , @xmath14 , may be calculated from the conventional ( integrated ) parton densities , @xmath56 or @xmath57 , in the case of pure dglap evolution .",
    "recall that the number of partons in the proton with ( plus ) momentum fraction between @xmath11 and @xmath58 and transverse momentum @xmath0 between zero and the factorisation scale @xmath13 is @xmath59 whereas the number of partons with ( plus ) momentum fraction between @xmath11 and @xmath58 and transverse momentum squared between @xmath60 and @xmath61 is @xmath62 thus the unintegrated distributions must satisfy the normalisation relation , @xmath63 the kmr proposal @xcite to determine the unintegrated distributions was to relax the dglap strong ordering in the last evolution step only , that is , @xmath64 , where we have omitted the subscript @xmath65 on the @xmath0 of the last propagator .",
    "this procedure is expected to account for the major part of the conventional next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) terms , that is , terms like @xmath66 , compared to the usual leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) where only terms like @xmath67 are included .",
    "the procedure is as follows .",
    "we start from the lo dglap equation evaluated at a scale @xmath0 : @xmath68,\\ ] ] where @xmath69 are the unregulated lo dglap splitting kernels .",

    "so far , we have ignored the singular behaviour of the unregularised splitting kernels , @xmath69 , at @xmath83 , corresponding to soft gluon emission .",
    "these soft singularities cancel between the real and virtual parts of the dglap equation .",
    "after resumming the virtual part to all orders in the sudakov factor the singularities must be regulated for the unintegrated distributions to be defined .",
    "the singularities indicate a physical effect that we have not yet accounted for . here , it is the angular ordering caused by colour coherence , implying a cutoff on the splitting fraction @xmath25 for those splitting kernels where a real gluon is emitted in the @xmath71-channel .",
    "we now apply the angular - ordering constraints of section  [ sec : evolution ] specifically to the last evolution step . for all other evolution steps ,",
    "the strong ordering in transverse momentum automatically ensures angular ordering .",
    "the condition @xmath84 implies @xmath85 where , as before , we have dropped the subscript @xmath65 specifying the last evolution step .",
    "recall , from the comment below , that @xmath13 is entirely determined from the kinematics of the subprocess at the top of the evolution ladder : @xmath86 equation   applies only to those splitting functions in the real part of the dglap equation associated with gluon emission in the @xmath71-channel . by unitarity",
    "the same form of the cutoff must be chosen in the virtual part .",
    "we define @xmath87 and insert @xmath88 into the sudakov factor for those splitting functions where a gluon is emitted in the @xmath71-channel and @xmath89 where a gluon is emitted in the @xmath72-channel .",

    "we have @xmath96 so that the gluon sudakov factor is @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the active number of quark  antiquark flavours into which the gluon may split .    it is important to note that the starting point of our derivation is the lo dglap equation , with lo dglap splitting kernels and one - loop running coupling .",
    "therefore , in order for the normalisation to be satisfied , it is essential that we use a lo parton set where the integrated parton distributions have been determined using the same splitting kernels and running coupling . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the mrst99 parton set @xcite was used , which has been determined using nlo dglap splitting kernels and two - loop running coupling , therefore was found not to be satisfied . also , in ref .",

    "it can be shown that the rapidity in the @xmath300 frame is @xmath301\\,,\\ ] ] where , in the breit frame , the initial positron has transverse momentum squared of @xmath302 and the 4-momentum of the outgoing jet has been written in the form @xmath303 it is necessary to average the cross section over the azimuthal angle @xmath304 between the positron and the outgoing jet in the transverse plane .",
    "for the `` nlo '' @xmath1-factorisation calculation , the jet 4-momenta are not necessarily the same as the 4-momenta of the outgoing partons .",
    "it is necessary to pass the 4-momenta through a jet algorithm . rather than",
    "use to determine @xmath305 , which would require an additional azimuthal averaging , it is simpler to explicitly transform the 4-momenta from the breit to the lab frame , then calculate the rapidity of the resultant 4-momenta .    .",
    "the predictions of the @xmath1-factorisation approach based on doubly - unintegrated partons ( which is much simpler to implement ) are in good agreement with the conventional qcd approach . in some bins the predictions of the latter approach are hidden beneath the bold lines of the @xmath1-factorisation approach , at the respective order .",
    "[ fig : h1plot],scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : h1plot ] we show @xmath306 integrated over @xmath166 between 5 and 100 gev@xmath293 in three rapidity intervals . for the results presented , we used the mrst2001 lo parton set @xcite as input .",
    "the nlo qcd predictions have been taken from the plot in fig .  1 of the h1 paper @xcite ;",
    "these were obtained with the ` disent ` program @xcite using cteq5 m partons @xcite , a renormalisation scale of @xmath167 and a factorisation scale of @xmath294 .",
    "the hadronisation correction factors used in @xcite have been applied to all the theory predictions .",
    "the statistical and systematic uncertainties have been added in quadrature to estimate the total experimental uncertainty .",
    "the lo @xmath1-factorisation calculation is in excellent agreement with conventional lo qcd , but neither describe the data well , especially in the forward rapidity region .",
    "the `` nlo '' @xmath1-factorisation calculation is in very good agreement with conventional nlo qcd , although the agreement gets slightly worse as @xmath167 increases .- factorisation predictions are significantly higher than the nlo qcd predictions .",
    "this is due to the jet algorithm applied , which increases the `` nlo '' @xmath1-factorisation predictions by more than a factor of two in these two bins only , compared to the result when no jet algorithm is applied . ]",
    "deviations of the data from nlo qcd are seen only at small @xmath167 in the forward region . here ,",
    "the nlo corrections are quite large and it is likely that nnlo corrections or resolved virtual photon contributions are important in this region . again , taking the limit @xmath24 makes the @xmath1-factorisation predictions much worse , showing that it is important to keep the precise kinematics .",
    "we have presented a method for determining unintegrated parton distributions , @xmath14 , from the conventional ( integrated ) parton distributions , by considering the last dglap evolution step separately , and imposing angular - ordering constraints on gluon emission . to include the precise kinematics in the hard subprocess initiated by the final parton in the evolution ladder ,",
    "it is necessary to consider _",
    "doubly_-unintegrated parton distributions , @xmath26 .",
    "we gave a prescription , called @xmath1-factorisation , for the computation of cross sections using these distributions .",
    "this prescription is a natural generalisation of the @xmath0-factorisation approach .",
    "we used @xmath1-factorisation to estimate the cross section for inclusive jet production at hera at lowest order . using the same lo doubly - unintegrated distributions",
    ", we then carried out a `` nlo '' calculation which included the dominant feynman diagrams with the soft gluon singularities being regulated by angular ordering .",
    "we showed that at @xmath307 the predictions of the approach based on doubly - unintegrated partons , with exact kinematics , are close to the conventional lo qcd calculation at @xmath308 .",
    "the relative simplicity of the former approach is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : lojets ] .",
    "similarly , at @xmath308 the predictions of the approach based on doubly - unintegrated partons are close to the conventional nlo qcd calculation at @xmath174 .",
    "it was seen that the nlo corrections are large in the forward region at low @xmath167 and low @xmath166 where the agreement with the data is poor .",
    "it is possible that the simplified @xmath1-factorisation approach might help to evaluate the rle of the nnlo contribution .",
    "alternatively , the resolved photon contribution is known to be important in the regime where @xmath167 is much greater than @xmath294 .",
    "it would be better to calculate the resolved photon contribution in terms of the doubly - unintegrated parton distributions of the photon .",
    "the logical next step would be to show that doubly - unintegrated distributions can be applied to @xmath309 and @xmath310 collisions .",
    "the simplest calculation would be the transverse momentum distribution of produced @xmath311 and @xmath312 bosons .",
    "we conclude that by reorganising the perturbative expansion in @xmath145 to keep only the most important terms , our method provides a simple but effective way of estimating exclusive ( and inclusive ) observables .",

    "we also thank the uk particle physics and astronomy research council and the russian fund for fundamental research ( grants 01 - 02 - 17095 and ss-1124.2003.2 ) for financial support .",
