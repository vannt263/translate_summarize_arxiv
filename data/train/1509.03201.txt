    "the ferromagnetic ising model on finite graph @xmath0 at inverse temperature @xmath1 with external field @xmath2 is defined by the gibbs measure @xmath3 with hamiltonian @xmath4 and partition function @xmath5    the central computational challenge associated with the measure   is to estimate certain moments of physically relevant random variables .",
    "chief amongst such moments are the two - point correlation function and susceptibility .",
    "while the problem is simple to pose , studying such quantities on large graphs is typically a computationally demanding task , and it is therefore not surprising that the markov - chain monte carlo method is one of the most common approaches employed .",
    "this computational intractability can in fact be made precise in the language of complexity theory .",
    "it was recently established  @xcite that computing the susceptibility of the ising model is # p - hard , and the # p - hardness of the two - point correlation function then follows as an immediate corollary .",
    "various # p - hardness results are also known for the ising partition function  @xcite .    in order for a particular markov chain to provide efficient estimators ,",
    "it is necessary that it converges rapidly to stationarity .",
    "consequently , in addition to the single - spin glauber process  @xcite , which has a direct physical interpretation , a host of more sophisticated processes have been devised , with the aim of improving the efficiency of the resulting estimators .",
    "these processes typically augment , or replace , the spin measure   with a particular graphical representation .",
    "for example , sweeny  @xcite proposed studying the zero - field potts model using the single - bond glauber process for the fortuin - kasteleyn model  @xcite , while the swendsen - wang ( sw ) process  @xcite simulates a natural coupling  @xcite of the fortuin - kasteleyn model and zero - field potts model .",
    "similarly , jerrum and sinclair  @xcite studied a single - bond metropolis process for the high - temperature representation of the ising model in a strictly positive field .",
    "prokofev and svistunov  @xcite also considered a space of ising high temperature graphs , however their _ worm _ process applies to the case of zero field , and uses a novel choice of local moves .",
    "given this abundance of markov - chain monte carlo algorithms for the ising model , one naturally seeks to understand and compare their efficiencies .",
    "a key quantity for characterizing the rate of convergence of reversible markov chains is the relaxation time . for a reversible finite markov chain with transition matrix @xmath6 , let @xmath7 denote the maximum absolute value of the non - trivial eigenvalues of @xmath6 .",
    "the relaxation time of @xmath6 is then simply the reciprocal of the ( absolute ) spectral gap @xmath8 each of the abovementioned types of process ( single - spin glauber , swendsen - wang etc ) , can be applied to the ising model on any finite graph .",
    "let @xmath9 be a given infinite family of finite graphs .",
    "for a given type of process , and a given choice of ising parameters @xmath10 , for each @xmath11 , we can consider the corresponding process for the ising model on @xmath12 with parameters @xmath10 .",
    "for each @xmath11 , we then have a corresponding value of @xmath13 .",
    "if the map @xmath14 can be bounded above by a polynomial in @xmath15 , one says that type of process is _ rapidly mixing _ on @xmath9 , for the given choice of parameters @xmath10 .",
    "otherwise , the mixing is said to be _",
    "there is a vast literature discussing the mixing of the ising glauber process ; see for example the survey  @xcite .",
    "it has recently been shown  @xcite that if @xmath16 , then the ising glauber process is rapidly mixing for all graphs of maximum degree @xmath17 .",
    "this result is tight in the sense that if @xmath18 , then , with high probability , the mixing of the zero - field ising glauber process on random @xmath17-regular graphs is torpid  @xcite . for finite boxes in @xmath19 , the zero - field glauber process is rapidly mixing above the critical temperature  @xcite , and _ at _ the critical temperature  @xcite , but torpid below the critical temperature  @xcite .",
    "the same behaviour is known to occur in zero field on the complete graph , where the mixing is very well understood  @xcite at all temperatures .",
    "the swendsen - wang process has also been the subject of significant study .",
    "we focus on results for the ising case .",
    "mixing on the complete graph is very well understood  @xcite at all temperatures . for graphs with bounded maximum degree ,",
    "rapid mixing was established for all sufficiently high temperatures in  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that for such graphs , rapid mixing of the single - site glauber process implies rapid mixing of the swendsen - wang process  @xcite .",
    "in particular , given the single - site glauber results mentioned above , this established rapid mixing of the swendsen - wang process on finite boxes in @xmath19 for all temperatures at and above the critical temperature .",
    "comparison results between the swendsen - wang process and the single - bond glauber process for the fortuin - kasteleyn model have also been recently established  @xcite , which show that the single - bond process is rapidly mixing iff the swendsen - wang process is rapidly mixing . as a consequence , by exploiting the duality of the fortuin - kasteleyn model , this established rapid mixing of the swendsen - wang process on boxes in @xmath19 at all temperatures below the critical temperature .",
    "currently , perhaps the best understood of the above mentioned processes , however , is the jerrum - sinclair - ising ( jsi ) process  @xcite , which is known to be rapidly mixing on all graphs , at all temperatures , provided the field is strictly positive . specifically :    the relaxation time of the jsi process on any finite connected graph with @xmath20 vertices , at any temperature , and in a field @xmath21 satisfies @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "[ js theorem ]    the divergence of the upper bound for @xmath24 as @xmath25 is to be expected , given that the process is not irreducible when @xmath26 .",
    "as a consequence of theorem  [ js theorem ] , in  @xcite a _ fully - polynomial randomized approximation scheme _ ( fpras ) was constructed for the ising partition function , as well as the mean energy and magnetization .",
    "an fpras  @xcite for an ising observable @xmath27 is a randomized algorithm which , given as input a problem instance @xmath28 and real numbers @xmath29 $ ] , outputs a random number @xmath30 satisfying @xmath31 \\ge 1-\\eta,\\ ] ] in a time which is at most a polynomial in @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . notably , despite the fact that the jsi process is not irreducible when @xmath35 , the fprases constructed in  @xcite are valid for all @xmath36 , including @xmath35 . in  @xcite ,",
    "a fully - polynomial approximate generator from the measure   is described , which uses successive calls of the partition function fpras presented in  @xcite to generate approximate samples from the fortuin - kasteleyn measure , from which ising samples can then be generated using the edwards - sokal coupling  @xcite .    in the present article",
    ", we study the mixing of the worm process . like the jsi process",
    ", the worm process is based on the high temperature expansion of the ising model .",
    "however , the key difference between the two approaches is that while  @xcite considered only strictly positive fields in their high temperature expansions , @xcite considered only the case of strictly zero field . as a consequence , while the configuration space of the measure considered in  @xcite consists of the full edge space of @xmath12 , the configuration space introduced in  @xcite consists of spanning subgraphs subject to strong constraints on the vertex degrees .",
    "while this may at first sight seem to be a disadvantage , the worm process provides a simple and natural method of sampling from this non - trivial space of combinatorial objects , and gives rise to particularly natural estimators for the ising susceptibility , and two - point correlation function .",
    "the worm process was first introduced in the context of quantum monte carlo in  @xcite , and classical versions were subsequently described in  @xcite . in  @xcite , a numerical study of the worm process concluded that it is currently the most efficient method known for estimating the susceptibility of the three - dimensional ising model . numerical evidence presented in  @xcite",
    "also suggests it provides a very efficient method for studying the ising two - point correlation function .",
    "applications and extensions of the worm process now constitute an active topic in computational physics ; see for example  @xcite . to our knowledge , however , no rigorous results have previously been reported on the mixing of the worm process .    in the current article , we prove that the worm process for the zero - field ising model is rapidly mixing on all connected graphs , at all temperatures . as a corollary , we show that the standard worm estimators for the susceptibility and two - point correlation functions used by computational physicists , which are simply sample means of natural observables , define fully - polynomial randomized approximation schemes for these quantities . in the latter case , we restrict attention to the correlations between pairs of vertices whose graph distance is bounded above by some fixed distance @xmath37 .",
    "let us outline the remainder of this article .",
    "section  [ sec : preliminaries ] establishes some preliminary notation and terminology that we shall use throughout .",
    "our main results on the relaxation and mixing times are then stated in section  [ sec : main results ] . in section",
    "[ sec : worm measure and process ] we introduce and study the prokofev - svistunov ( ps ) measure , and describe its relationship to the ising model .",

    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : mixing time bound ] is presented in section [ sec : proof of main theorem ] .",
