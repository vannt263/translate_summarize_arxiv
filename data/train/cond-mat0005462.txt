    "the understanding of spin - charge separation is a central point in the physics of low - dimensional electronic systems .",
    "that issue is most clearly seen in one dimension where the exact solution of the 1d hubbard model @xcite reveals that the low - energy physics is dominated by decoupled , collective charge and spin excitations ( also called holon and spinon , respectively ) . the idea that the spin and charge degrees of freedom separate has also been proposed to explain the properties of 2d cuprate superconductors .",
    "@xcite however , even in one dimension , the bethe ansatz solution did not yet give a complete answer for the spectral function @xmath8 . only for @xmath9 an exact expression for @xmath8",
    "was found @xcite due to the factorization property of the wave function according to ogata and shiba .",
    "@xcite the results for the insulating half - filled case @xcite could also be generalized to other filling factors . @xcite",
    "the spin - charge separation was observed in arpes measurements of the one dimensional , dielectric cuprate srcuo@xmath10 .",
    "@xcite the spinon and holon branch of the spectral function were seen , in contrast to the analogous experiment of one hole in the cuo@xmath10 plane @xcite where spin and charge are coupled and the spin polaron quasiparticle has a dispersion proportional to @xmath1 as proposed theoretically in refs .  .",
    "the arpes spectra in srcuo@xmath10 were analyzed using the pure @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "on the other hand , many 1d compounds , like for instance cugeo@xmath11 , @xcite are characterized by frustration in the magnetic subsystem which may lead to a gap in the spin excitation spectrum .",
    "for the special frustration @xmath12 and in the limit @xmath3 an analytic expression for @xmath13 was derived recently , @xcite under the assumption that the wave function factorizes . besides the frustration ,",
    "also temperature effects are important as it was observed in arpes measurements on na@xmath14v@xmath10o@xmath15 .",
    "so , there is a clear need to study the spectral function systematically under the influence of frustration and temperature and to derive analytic expressions .",
    "the present work focuses mainly on the effect of frustration and temperature on the spectral function in the insulating case . for that , we rederive first the exact solution of sorella and parola @xcite in a straightforward way using green s function technique .",

    "our derivation is applicable for any magnetic state and any temperature in that limit .",
    "especially , one can show that the result which was derived in ref .   does not depend on the assumption that the wave function factorizes .",
    "we present analytic expressions for the spectral function of one hole in several magnetic states : ( i ) the ground - state of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model , ( ii ) the majumdar - ghosh wave function @xcite at the special frustration @xmath16 , and ( iii ) the ideal paramagnetic state at temperatures much larger than the exchange energy @xmath7 .    for large finite coupling",
    "we compare two methods to account for corrections @xmath17 , namely the projection method and a variational ansatz using the set of eigenoperators of the @xmath0-term .",
    "we show that the former method yields a reasonable description of the spinon dispersion in the pure @xmath0-@xmath1 model ( sec .",
    "iv ) and an approximate result for the spectral function of the majumdar - ghosh model .",
    "for @xmath5 it misses the bound state below the continuum which is obtained by the more accurate variational method ( sec .",
    "the bound state has a finite spectral weight but a very small separation from the continuum .",
    "both methods show in the majumdar - ghosh case that the low energy region for momenta @xmath18 between @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( lattice constant @xmath21 ) will be filled with states , that the spinon dispersion ( i.e.  that collective excitation corresponding to the lower edge of the continuum ) becomes symmetric around @xmath19 , and they indicate an overdamped holon branch .",
    "the damping of the holon branch is extremely large for very high temperatures ( sec .",
    "vi ) .    before presenting our results",
    "let us shortly discuss the different understandings of the term `` spin - charge separation '' as it can be met in the literature .",
    "the naive picture means that the low energy effective hamiltonian may be written as @xmath22=0 \\ ; , \\ ] ] and the electron operator is the product @xmath23 where spinon @xmath24 and holon @xmath25 can be basically regarded as free particles .",

    "@xcite there , it was found that the eigenstates factorize in the limit @xmath4 in the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the spatial coordinates of the @xmath34 electrons on a @xmath30-site ring , and the @xmath35 coordinates label the position of the spin - up electrons on the squeezed heisenberg ring , i.e.  on the @xmath34 occupied sites .",
    "the @xmath36 is a spinless fermion state , and @xmath37 is an eigenstate of an @xmath34-site heisenberg hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the product form of equation ( [ wf ] ) should not be interpreted as a trivial decoupling between charge and spin .",
    "in fact , the momentum of the spin wave function imposes a twisted boundary condition on the spinless fermion wave function . as a result , the fermi distribution function @xmath38 in ( [ astr ] ) will be replaced by a function @xmath39 that is the expectation value of a chain of spin operators that has to be determined from the pure spin system @xcite ( for the details see sec.iii ) .",
    "the singularity of @xmath39 produces additional peaks in @xmath8 .",
    "this correct answer for the spectral function may be understood as a manifestation of the _ phase string _ effect .",
    "it means that spinon and holon interact with each other via a nonlocal phase - string . instead of ( [ sh ] )",
    "we should write @xmath40 .\\ ] ] it should be noted that the phenomenon of spin - charge separation is not restricted to the limit @xmath4 in the 1d hubbard model . at any finite @xmath41",
    "the spin and charge fluctuations propagate with different velocities . @xcite",
    "that means that after some time the spin and charge degrees of freedom will be separated in space .",
    "but there is no analytic solution for the spectral function of the hubbard model at arbitrary values of @xmath41 and also the present calculation treats terms of order @xmath42 as a perturbation .",
    "in that sense we will understand here spin - charge separation as a manifestation of the factorization property ( [ wf ] ) in the spectral density .",
    "sharp maxima in the continuum correspond to collective excitations whereas possible bound states indicate special eigenfunctions with a strong coupling between spin and charge .",
    "another possible effect of additional terms in the hamiltonian is the broadening ( i.e.  the damping ) of the collective excitations .",
    "to describe the low energy physics of compounds with a 1d electronic structure it is sufficient in most cases to take into account only that band which is closest to the fermi energy ( see for instance ref .  ) . treating the on - site coulomb interaction explicitly ,",
    "one obtains the well known 1d hubbard model . in the present calculation",

    "such a string can be produced by creating a hole in the nel state and applying several times the kinetic energy ( [ tx ] ) which creates misaligned spins .",
    "similar string operators were used to describe the spin polaron quasiparticle in the 2d case . @xcite",

    "the effect of the @xmath201 terms can only be treated approximatively ( see ( [ e37 ] ) ) but it was checked by the variational method that its influence on the spectral function can be neglected .    the information on @xmath39 and @xmath127 is sufficient to calculate the spectral function ( fig .",
    "it is surprising that the strong singularities at the band edges survive despite the large temperature .",
    "the lower edge disperses according to the dispersion of the spinon ( [ st ] ) with a width proportional to @xmath1 and has its minimum at @xmath146 ( in contrast to the frustrated case fig .  3 with a minimum at @xmath145 ) .",
    "but a peak connected with the holon dispersion proportional to @xmath0 is not seen in fig .",
    "such a peak appears in the finite temperature spectral function of the 2d @xmath0-@xmath1 model @xcite and it can be expected since the first moment of the spectral function disperses according to @xmath202 .",
    "its absence in 1d is a nontrivial and unexpected result .",
    "it can be understood in the present context since the holon branch is strongly damped due to the suppression of the singularity in @xmath39 at @xmath172 . apparently , that suppression is more strong in ( [ 52 ] ) than in the frustrated case ( [ 45 ] ) such that the holon branch is still visible in fig .  3",
    "but it disappears nearly in fig .",
    "one should note that the above result holds only in the region @xmath203 .",
    "one may speculate that a further increase of the temperature such that the constraint of no double occupancy is lifted should lead to drastic changes in the spectral function .",
    "the strong singularities at the lower or upper band edges should disappear and a free dispersion should become visible .",
    "in conclusion we could derive analytic expressions for the spectral function of one hole in several magnetic states .",
    "the expressions are rigorous in the limit @xmath3 , but our approach allows also to calculate the small @xmath1 corrections .",
    "we analyzed the frustration and temperature effects .",
    "results were given for the special frustration @xmath5 with a gap in the spin excitation spectrum and for the ideal paramagnetic case .",
    "both effects , frustration and temperature , lead to low - energy excitations between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and to a strong damping of the holon branches in the spectral function caused by the suppression of the singularity at the fermi edge of spinons .",
    "the exchange terms in the mg model were found to be responsible for the finite weight of the lowest eigenstate and its finite , but small , energy separation from the rest of the spectrum , i.e.  the bound state .",
    "the proposed scenario of holon branch damping seems to be a universal feature of frustration and temperature .",
    "therefore , our results are of direct importance for photoemission experiments on strongly frustrated 1d compounds like cugeo@xmath11 , for instance .",
    "however , edge - shared cuprate chains have a smaller energy scale and less ideal 1d behavior in comparison with corner - shared compounds , @xcite which hinders direct comparison with experiment . but",
    "it can not be excluded that a small frustration is also present in srcuo@xmath10 such that our study gives one possible reason , why no real , separate holon branch could be observed in the experimental spectra of srcuo@xmath10 between @xmath144 and @xmath19 .",
