    "graph isomorphism problem and its derivatives , such as graph matching@xcite ( in pattern recognition ) and graph similarity problem have numerous applications in many areas such as biology , chemistry@xcite , pattern recognition@xcite and web structure mining@xcite .",
    "graph matching has been the topic of numerous studies in computer science over the last decades . in graph matching problem , the goal is to find maximum corresponding regions in graphs which match .",
    "the graph isomorphism is in fact an exact graph matching . in the graph similarity problem ,",
    "the main interest is to assign an overall similarity score to indicate the level of similarity between two graphs@xcite .",
    "maximum common subgraph@xcite , edit distance methods @xcite and measuring distance based on some operations @xcite are some approaches to compare the similarity of two graphs .",
    "another approach is using graph kernels@xcite . + solving the graph isomorphism problem and related problems , entirely , based on our perception or insight to graph structure .",
    "therefore , the main step towards effective solution of these problems is having a good framework to represent graphs .",
    "this paper provides a new framework to analyze a graph structure .",
    "the graph space is equipped by a dot product which makes it possible to have a coordinate representation for graphs .",
    "furthermore , the defined dot product donates a new metric to graph space and , also , introduces the orthogonality of graphs .",
    "this framework brings us a better sense about graph structure which benefits us in graph isomorphism , subgraph isomorphism problem or graph matching in pattern recognition .",
    "representing graphs by adjacency matrix , entirely , depends on the vertices ordering .",
    "hence , a graph finds different presentations , due to different reordering of its vertices .",
    "this fact stimulates us to ask if there is any other conceptual description of graphs which is unique for all isomorphic graphs .",
    "we want such description to be based on the graph structure instead of defining the edges state which , extremely , depends on vertices ordering .",
    "a complete set of graph invariants is such a conceptual description of graphs .",
    "graph spectrum is , roughly , what we want , but it does not specify each graph isomorphism class , uniquely , and the relation of a graph structure and its spectrum is not very clear . to know more about spectral methods in graph matching see@xcite .    usually , the smooth function @xmath6 is defined by giving the value of function on each points of the domain . also , it is possible to describe it in terms of the basis functions coefficients , such as @xmath7 and @xmath8 functions . in general , another way to define a function @xmath9 is the fourier series representation . although , the fourier series presentation always is not easy , but it sometimes provides some facilities which makes some complicated problems trivial .",
    "fourier series presentation offers a conceptual and structural view of functions which is the base of some technologies such as optics , telecommunications and mechanics engineering(vibration ) .",
    "having not such representation , we have not nowadays telecommunications ! the representation of a functions in terms of the basis functions provides a clear and conceptual view which enables us to be more strong dealing with functions , either in theory or applications .",
    "can we develop such tool dealing with graphs ?",
    "the first questions which , naturally , arise are    * how can we define a basis for graphs ? * how can we measure a graph is close to a basis element or not ?",
    "we answer these questions in this paper and define a coordinate representation for graphs . +",
    "if any @xmath4-vertex graph has a unique coordinates with respect to a graph set @xmath1 , then , we call @xmath2 is a basis for @xmath4-vertex graphs . we show that graphs with at most @xmath3 vertices are a basis for @xmath4-vertex graphs .",
    "this , simply , results that the graph isomorphism problem , almost always , can be solved in @xmath10 time .    in the second section , the suggested framework is drawn by defining graphs dot product , graph metrics , graph coordinate representation and graph basis .",
    "the third section explains how to use this new framework for the graph isomorphism problem and its derivatives , in theory or application .",
    "the set of graphs is not a hilbert space to have a dot product .",
    "but , we need something like that to be able to to define some basis and to measure how a graph is close to basis elements .",
    "the idea of kernel function embeds the set of graphs in a larger hilbert space which is equipped by a dot product@xcite . here , we want to define something like a dot product on any pairs of n - vertex graphs , directly .",

    "we define a dot product on @xmath11 .",

    "[ hardware ] . + more importantly",
    ", the basis elements can be chosen cleverly to decrease the computational complexity .",
    "for example , there are graphs that the computational complexity of their dot product to any arbitrary graph is polynomial time , such as bounded order graphs , star graphs @xmath108 , @xmath109 or @xmath110(@xmath111 is a fixed integer ) .",
    "we will see in the following that it is possible to have a basis for almost every @xmath4-vertex graph such that the computational complexity of dot product of any basis element with any arbitrary graph can be done in quasi - polynomial time .",
    "therefore , such basis provides a quasi - polynomial time graph isomorphism for almost any pair of @xmath4-vertex graph .",
    "a framework for solving the graph isomorphism problem or graph matching ( @xmath112 s are basis elements ) , width=377 ]    another application of the defined graph coordinate system is graph clustering , i.e. classifying a set of graphs according to their class of isomorphism .",

    "we need to compare any pair of graphs .",

    "for instance , if we can find a basis whose cardinality is a polynomial in terms of @xmath4 and the dot product of any graph with basis elements can be done in polynomial time in terms of @xmath4 , in fact , we have found a polynomial time algorithm for the graph isomorphism problem .",

    "such subgraph is called a graph anchor in @xcite . the idea of this proof is close , but more general than babai et al .",
    "+    [ almost ] almost every @xmath4-vertex graph has an asymmetric unique subgraph such that @xmath118 and no pair of vertices in @xmath119 have the same neighbors in @xmath32.(@xmath120 is a fixed integer )    _ proof _ : let @xmath13 be a graph on @xmath4 vertices .",

    "<S> if any graph of set @xmath0 has a unique coordinates with respect to a graph set @xmath1 , then , we call @xmath2 is a basis for the graphs set @xmath0 . having a basis , any graph finds a unique coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the graph isomorphism problem equals to comparison of the coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> this fact provides a formal approach to study the computational complexity of the graph isomorphism problem , i.e. finding a suitable basis . </S>",
    "<S> + we have shown that graphs on at most @xmath3 vertices make a basis for almost every @xmath4-vertex graphs . </S>",
    "<S> this fact , easily , results that graph isomorphism problem can be solved in @xmath5 time for almost every pair of @xmath4-vertex graphs .    * keywords * : graph isomorphism problem , quasi - polynomial time , graph orthogonality , graph dot product , graph metrics , graph coordinate representation , computational complexity . </S>"
