    "<S> the two - body transfer amplitude for the rearrangement process @xmath0 is constructed on the basis of technique of 4-dimensional covariant nonrelativistic graphs . </S>",
    "<S> the developed formalism is applied to describing backward elastic @xmath1 scattering in the energy range @xmath2 gev . </S>",
    "<S> numerical calculations performed using the 5- channel wave function of the @xmath3 nucleus show that the transfer of a noninteracting np- pair dominates and explains satisfactorily the energy and angular dependence of the differential cross section at energies @xmath4 gev . a weak sensitivity to high momentum components of the @xmath5 wave function in spite of large momentum transfer as well as a very important role of rescatterings in the initial and final states </S>",

    "<S> this value of @xmath9 is considerably larger than the @xmath9 value reached in the experiments with electron scattering from the @xmath10 nucleus and therefore one can hope to obtain an important new information about the structure of @xmath10 at short distances between nucleons @xmath11 from the @xmath12 scattering experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> simple models of the @xmath13 process like deuteron ( @xmath14 ) and singlet deuteron ( @xmath15 ) exchanges suggested previously in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite- @xcite are in agreement with this point of view and lead to the conclusion that the differential cross section of backward elastic @xmath1-scattering at initial energies 1 - 2 gev @xcite `` measures '' the high momentum components of @xmath3 wave function ( w.f . ) in the configurations @xmath16 . according to ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the momentum distributions in these channels , obtained from the experimental data on inclusive reactions @xmath17 and @xmath18 , are quite compatible with those from the @xmath13 process . </S>",
    "<S> however , the main drawback of the papers @xcite - @xcite is the use of the two - body approximation for the @xmath10 nucleus structure and the neglect of initial and final state interactions in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as shown here ( see @xcite ) , the relation between the full three - body wave function of the @xmath3 nucleus and the cross section of the @xmath13 process is nontrivial mainly due to three - body structure of @xmath3 and glauber rescatterings in the initial and final states . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the deuteron and singlet deuteron exchanges are negligible as compared to the noninteracting np - pair exchange which allows to explain the available experimental data at @xmath19 without involving high momentum components of the @xmath3 w.f .    </S>",
    "<S> we proceed from the technique of covariant 4-dimensional ( nonrelativistic ) feynman graphs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dominating mechanism displays weak sensitivity to the relativistic effects . for this reason the use of the nonrelativistic technique is valid . when processes involving three - body bound states @xmath20 are considered , the main element of this approach is the amplitude of the virtual decay of such a state into three particles @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest analytical behaviour is manifested by the truncated part of this amplitude , @xmath22 ) , which is the sum of those graphs which end in the interaction between particles only with indices @xmath23 and @xmath24 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the momentum and energy of relative motion in the @xmath27 pair respectively , @xmath28 is the momentum of the nucleon spectator @xmath29 in the center - of - mass system ( c.m.s . ) of @xmath20 nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of vertex functions @xmath30 and corresponding integral equations are presented in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . the most general formula for the two - nucleon transfer amplitude in the process 4 + \\{123}@xmath31 1 + \\{423 } </S>",
    "<S> is given by the sum of graphs in fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> the graph @xmath32 in fig.1 describes the transfer of two noninteracting nucleons with numbers 2 and 3 . the second graph @xmath33 in fig.1 describes the interacting pair transfer ( ipt ) , which contains the deuteron and singlet deuteron exchanges . </S>",
    "<S> after performing the integration over relative energy of the transferred pair @xmath34 , the first term transforms to the infinite series of 3-dimensional graphs . in the born approximation the sum of graphs in fig.1 can be written as @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the faddeev component of the full @xmath3 wave function @xcite @xmath38 ( the lower indices @xmath23 and @xmath39 denote the initial and final states respectively ) ; @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the spin - isospin wave functions of the protons ; @xmath42 is the binding energy of @xmath3 nucleus and @xmath43 denotes the nucleon mass . </S>",
    "<S> the terms @xmath44 correspond to the ipt , sequential transfer ( st ) in the born approximation and nonsequential transfer ( nst ) amplitudes respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the most important feature of the integral ( [ helio1 ] ) is the following . the term @xmath45 in the integrand of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ helio1 ] ) , which is responsible for the dominating st contribution , has the following structure of arguments @xmath46 @xmath47 the remaining two terms corresponding to the nst and ipt mechanisms have the forms @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 at the scattering angle @xmath51 we get @xmath52 . under this condition eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ p3h-85 ] ) differs from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ p3h-86 ] ) and ( [ p3h-87 ] ) in that two of four momenta can simultaneously became equal to zero at integration over @xmath53 ( for example , at the point @xmath54 one has @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ p3h-86 ] ) and ( [ p3h-87 ] ) only one momentum can be equal to zero while the other three have the values @xmath57 . in the kinematic region </S>",
    "<S> @xmath58 the momenta @xmath59 and @xmath60 have rather large values @xmath61 </S>",
    "<S> . one can conclude from this that term ( [ p3h-85 ] ) makes the dominating contribution to the integral ( [ helio1 ] ) since the functions @xmath62 decrease fast with increasing @xmath63 or @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> numerical calculations are performed using faddeev @xmath3 w.f . from @xcite for nn - potential in @xmath65 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath66 states in the rsc form . </S>",
    "<S> this wave function consists of 5 channels for each faddeev component @xmath67 . as shown in fig.2 , in the region @xmath68 the st contribution </S>",
    "<S> is by factor @xmath69 higher in comparison with the experimental data and by 3 - 4 orders of magnitude larger than the ipt and nst- contributions . at @xmath70 </S>",
    "<S> the st amplitude loses this advantages and as a result its contribution decreases very fast with increasing the difference @xmath71 , whereas the experimental angular dependence of the cross section is smooth ( fig.3 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the rescatterings in the initial and final states of the process @xmath72 in the framework of diffraction multistep theory of glauber - sitenko @xcite , we find for the @xmath73 transfer amplitude the following expression @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 here the amplitude @xmath77 is defined by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ helio1 ] ) and the amplitudes @xmath78 and @xmath79 describe the forward elastic @xmath1 and @xmath80-scattering , respectively , at the transferred momentum * q * ; @xmath81 and @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the c.m.s momenta of initial ( final ) @xmath3 nucleus and proton , respectively .    on the basis of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ helio2 ] ) we found that ( i ) the absolute value of the differential cross section at @xmath84 decreases considerably due to rescatterings and as a result agrees satisfactorily with the experimental data at @xmath85 @xcite ( fig.2 ) ; ( ii ) the angular dependence becomes very smooth in the range @xmath86 in qualitative agreement with the experimental data ( fig.3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section at @xmath84 decreases due to the imaginary part of the elastic @xmath87- scattering amplitude , which takes into account the coupling to inelastic channels . as shown recently in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the suppression factor caused by rescatterings in the framework of the same method is about @xmath88 for the one - nucleon exchange mechanism of the process @xmath89 </S>",
    "<S> . the smooth angular dependence comes from the fact that due to rescatterings the effective arguments of the w.f . of @xmath3 in the integrals ( [ helio2 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> decrease in the upper and the lower vertices simultaneously @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> weak sensitivity of the dominating st- mechanism to the high momentum components of @xmath3 w.f . </S>",
    "<S> is manifested by ( i ) the nonimportant contribution of d - components of w.f . at @xmath90 ( see fig.2 ) and ( ii ) very small enhancement of the cross section after substitution of lorenz - invariant momenta @xmath91 into the amplitude @xmath77 instead of nonrelativistic ones . from the other hand , both the d - component of the @xmath3 w.f . and relativistic effects are very important for the mechanism of deuteron exchange . however </S>",
    "<S> the role of that mechanism is negligible .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> an unexpected feature of process @xmath72 at @xmath68 is established , namely , a weak sensitivity of the dominating st mechanism to high momentum components of @xmath5 wave function in spite of large momentum transfer . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the st amplitude reduces exactly to zero if the component @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the antisymmetriser , is excluded from the @xmath3 w.f . according to the definition in work @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , it corresponds to the channel with number @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently the cross section of the process @xmath72 at @xmath84 measures the weight of this channel @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> faddeev calculations @xcite predict that the ground state spin of the @xmath3 nucleus is dominated by the neutron just due to this component of the @xmath3 w.f . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is of great interest to perform the experimental investigation of spin observables in this process at energies @xmath95    this work was supported in part by the russian foundation for basic researches ( grant @xmath96 96 - 02 - 17458 ) .    </S>",
