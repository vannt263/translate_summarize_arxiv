    "the recent discovery of the manifestly exotic baryon @xmath14 by the leps group at spring-8 has made a great impact on the exotic hadron physics @xcite .",
    "apart from other pentaquark baryon candidates , @xmath15 @xcite and @xmath16 @xcite , several other candidates of exotic hadrons have also been discovered , such as @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "they also receive an increasing interest from theoretical side as well .",
    "@xmath14 is supposed to have baryon number @xmath22 , charge @xmath23 and strangeness @xmath24 . since @xmath25 is the simplest quark content to implement this quantum number",
    ", @xmath14 is a manifestly exotic penta - quark(5q ) state .",
    "the penta - quark @xmath0 had been considered several times even before the experimental discovery @xcite . in particular",
    ", ref.@xcite provided the direct motivation of the experimental search @xcite .",
    "the discovered peak in the @xmath26 invariant mass is centered at @xmath27 gev with a width smaller than 25 mev . at the present stage ,",
    "some groups confirmed the leps discovery@xcite , while the others reported null results@xcite .",
    "it will still take a while to establish the existence or non - existence of @xmath14 experimentally @xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite claims that @xmath0 must be isoscalar , since no @xmath28 is observed in the @xmath29 invariant mass spectrum .",
    "enormous theoretical efforts have been devoted to 5q baryons @xcite .",
    "one of the most challenging problems in understanding its structure is its extremely narrow decay width as @xmath30 mev @xcite .",
    "several ideas have been proposed : ( 1 ) @xmath31 possibility @xcite , ( 2 ) jaffe - wilczek s diquark picture @xcite , ( 3 ) @xmath32 hepta - quark picture @xcite , ( 4 ) string picture @xcite , ( 5 ) @xmath11 possibility @xcite .",
    "although each gives a mechanism to explain the narrow decay width , none of them can satisfy all the known properties of @xmath14 simultaneously . in this paper , we are interested in the @xmath33 possibility , @xmath11 in particular .",
    "note that the spin of @xmath14 has not yet been determined experimentally . in the constituent quark picture ,",
    "the narrow decay width of @xmath11 penta - quarks can be understood in the following way @xcite .",
    "we expect that the special configuration @xmath34 is dominant in the 5q ground - state in @xmath11 channel .",
    "although @xmath11 penta - quarks can decay to kn in the d - wave , the spectroscopic factor to find d - wave kn states in the dominant @xmath34 configuration vanishes .",
    "since the decay is thus allowed only through its sub - dominant d - wave configuration , the decay width is suppressed .",
    "note that it is further suppressed by the d - wave centrifugal barrier , leading to the significantly narrow decay width of @xmath11 penta - quarks .",
    "a possible disadvantage of @xmath11 assignment is that such a state tends to be massive due to the color - magnetic interaction in the constituent quark models , which seems to be one of the main reasons why there are only a limited number of effective model studies for spin 3/2 penta - quarks @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear whether these conventional framework is applicable to a new exotic 5q system as @xmath14 without involving any modifications . indeed ,",
    "a model was proposed where a part of the role of the color - magnetic interaction can be played by the flavor - spin interaction , which makes the mass - splitting between the @xmath35 and the @xmath36 states smaller @xcite .    there have been several lattice qcd calculations of 5q states by today@xcite . however , these studies are restricted to @xmath37 channels except for a very recent one @xcite .",
    "enormous efforts are being devoted to more accurate studies of @xmath37 states , using the variational technique to extract multiple excited states , among which a compact resonance state is sought for .",
    "indeed , quite large scale calculations are planned and being performed@xcite attempting to elucidate some of the mysterious natures of @xmath14 such as its diquark structure and/or non - localities desired in interpolating fields . here , we emphasize again that these studies are aiming at @xmath37 states , not at @xmath38 states .    in this paper",
    ", we present anisotropic lattice qcd results on 5q states in @xmath39 channels using a large number of gauge configurations as @xmath2 as an attempt to search for a low - lying 5q state in @xmath39 channel . we adopt the standard wilson gauge action at @xmath3 on the @xmath40 lattice with the renormalized anisotropy @xmath41 .",
    "the anisotropic lattice is known to serve as a powerful tool for high - precision measurements of temporal correlators @xcite .",
    "the large number of gauge configurations @xmath42 plays a key role in our calculation , because 5q correlators in @xmath43 channels are found to be quite noisy .",
    "for quark action , we adopt @xmath4-improved wilson ( clover ) action with four values of the hopping parameter as @xmath44 .",
    "one of the purpose of our calculation is to examine how the results depend on the choice of interpolating field operators .",
    "we employ several types of interpolating fields as ( a ) the nk@xmath9-type , ( b ) the ( color-)twisted nk@xmath9-type , ( c ) a diquark - type , and adopt a smeared source to enhance the low - lying spectra . in @xmath11 channel , we obtain massive states @xmath45 gev except for the diquark - type interpolating field , which involves a considerable size of the statistical error . in @xmath13 channel , we obtain more massive states @xmath46 gev .",
    "none of these 5q states appear below the nk threshold .",
    "note that the nk threshold is raised up by about @xmath47 mev due to the finite extent of the spatial lattice as @xmath48 fm , from which we expect the penta - quark signal to appear below the ( raised ) nk threshold considering the empirical mass difference between n+k(1440 ) and @xmath14 . to clarify whether our 5q states are compact resonance or not",

    "another interpolating fields of our possible interests are diquark - type interpolating fields such as @xmath55 which is an extension to the one proposed in refs .",

    "note that , although the axial - vector diquark ( color @xmath56 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) is considered to play a more important role than the vector diquark , it can not replace the vector diquark due to its iso - vector nature .",

    "however , actual lattice qcd calculation shows that its correlator is afflicted with quite a huge statistical error .",
    "a possible reason could be attributed to the fact that both of these diquark fields do not survive the non - relativistic limit .",

    ", we can at least state that these 5q states are all massive , which locate above nk@xmath9(p - wave ) threshold .",
    "we have studied @xmath39 penta - quark(5q ) baryons in anisotropic lattice qcd at the quenched level with a large number of gauge field configurations as @xmath154 for high precision measurements .",
    "we emphasize that the spin of @xmath14 has not yet determined experimentally , and that the @xmath11 assignment provides us with one of the possible solutions to the puzzle of the narrow decay width of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "we have employed the standard wilson gauge action on the anisotropic lattice of the size @xmath40 with the renormalized anisotropy @xmath155 at @xmath3 , which leads to @xmath156 fm and @xmath157 fm . we have found that correlators of 5q baryons in @xmath39 channels are rather noisy .",
    "hence , the large statistics as @xmath2 has played a key role to get a solid result in our calculation . for the quark part ,",
    "we have employed @xmath4-improved wilson ( clover ) action with four values of the hopping parameters as @xmath5 , which roughly cover the quark mass region as @xmath158 . to avoid the contaminations of higher spectral contributions ,",
    "we have employed the spatially extended source in the 5q correlators .",
    "we have examined several types of the 5q interpolating fields as ( a ) the nk@xmath9-type , ( b ) the ( color-)twisted nk@xmath9-type , ( c ) the diquark - type . in @xmath11 channel , there are plateaus in the effective mass plots for the nk@xmath9-type and the twisted nk@xmath9-type interpolating field , whereas no plateau has been identified in that for the diquark - type interpolating field due to the significantly large statistical error .",
    "the former two give almost identical results .",
    "we have employed the linear chiral extrapolations in @xmath115 , which have lead to @xmath159 and @xmath160 gev for the nk@xmath9-type and the twisted nk@xmath9-type 5q correlators , respectively . in @xmath13 channel , we have recognized plateaus in all the three effective mass plots . however , the plateau for the nk@xmath9-type interpolating field is located at a somewhat higher energy than the other two .",
    "the chiral extrapolations have lead to @xmath161 gev for the nk@xmath9-type correlator , @xmath162 gev for the twisted nk@xmath9-type correlator , and @xmath163 gev for the diquark - type correlator . in this way ,",
    "our data have not supported low - lying 5q states in both @xmath43 channels .",
    "all the 5q states have been observed to appear above the d / p - wave nk threshold , which is artificially raised up by a few hundred mev due to the finiteness of the spatial lattice as @xmath48 fm .",
    "note that , to obtain low - lying 5q states in @xmath39 channel , a 5q state should appear below the raised nk threshold(p / d - wave ) at least in the light quark mass region .",
    "in order to clarify whether the observed states are compact 5q resonances or not , we have performed an analysis with hybrid boundary condition(hbc ) , which was recently proposed by ref.@xcite . in @xmath11 channel",
    ", our 5q states observed in the nk@xmath9-type and the twisted nk@xmath9-type correlators have turned out to be s - wave nk@xmath9 scattering states . in @xmath13 channel , for the twisted nk@xmath9-type and the diquark - type correlators , the observed 5q states are most likely to be nk@xmath9(p - wave ) scattering states .",
    "for the other one , i.e. , the nk@xmath9-type interpolating field , although more statistics is needed to draw a definite conclusion , it is most likely to be an s - wave n@xmath9k@xmath9 scattering state .",
    "note that , since hbc does not affected the two - particle spectra so much in @xmath13 channel , it is not easy to elucidate the natures of the 5q states only with hbc . at any rate ,",
    "whatever the real nature of these 5q states may be , they result in a considerably massive states in the physical quark mass region , which can not be identified as @xmath14 without involving a significantly large chiral contribution . in this way",
    ", we have not obtained any relevant signals for low - lying compact 5q resonance states in @xmath39 channel below 2.1 gev in this paper , although the @xmath11 possibility provides us with one of the possible solutions to the puzzle of the narrow decay width of @xmath14 . to get more solid conclusion on the pentaquark ,",
    "it is important to perform the systematic studies of the 5q states with the various quantum numbers in lattice qcd with more sophisticated conditions .",
    "for instance , it is desired to use ( 1 ) unquenched full lattice qcd , ( 2 ) finer and larger volume lattice , ( 3 ) chiral fermion with small mass , ( 4 ) more sophisticated interpolating field corresponding to the diquark picture and so on . in any case , the mysterious exotic hadron of the pentaquark would be much clarified in future studies of lattice qcd as well as in the future experiments .",
