    "for a clock to work , according to , it is necessary to have a ) different energy states present , and b ) coherence between these states .",
    "this might be easier to understand if we first look at the more familiar situation for space instead of time . in order to have a highly accurate definition of a point in space we need , according to , a well localized wavepacket .",
    "this contains a large spread of momentum states . indeed if we had only _",
    "one _ momentum component the would be completely spread out everywhere and in no definite position at all .",
    "so localization in position requires a spread of momentum states .",
    "but this is not enough .",
    "in addition these momentum states must be _",
    "coherent_. if one momentum state alone is spread out everywhere , it is only the phases between the different momentum states that allows them to cancel everywhere but in the vicinity of one point . and",
    "so if these states are added _ incoherently _ the system is still not localized .    and",
    "so is it also with energy eigenstates and time .",
    "a single energy eigenstate by itself does not tic , it must `` beat '' or interfere with something else .",
    "typically , with atoms or molecules , we have a second energy eigenstate nearby and we observe the oscillating electromagnetic field resulting from the beating of the two levels . or",
    "we can suppose a @xmath1-meson clock  @xcite or neutrino clock using the oscillations in flavor ( strangeness , electron - muon number ) resulting from the interference of different mass eigenstates .",
    "if the two atomic or molecular levels are not coherent , the emitted photons will be `` chaotic '' and the electromagnetic field has no well - defined phase suitable for a clock ; if the two kaon or neutrino states  @xcite are incoherent there will be no oscillations .",
    "we thus see that in addition to the slowing down of time which is possible by relativistic effects , there is a further aspect to time as physical process : coherence and incoherence .",
    "to deal with such questions of coherence and incoherence in it is not enough to think about the wavefunction of the system in question . we need a quantity which can describe something like an average over different wavefunctions .",
    "the tool for this in is the density matrix .",
    "the  is easy to understand if we suppose having  in our minds  the complete , big of the whole world , or at least that part of it that might interact with what we want to study .",
    "what we want to study will in general only be a subsystem of what is described by the big and involves only a few of the total number of variables .",
    "let us take the simple case where this subsystem is a two - state system , with basis states @xmath2 .",
    "( one state would be _ too _ simple . )",
    "then the big can be written @xmath3 where the @xmath4 s are all the variables outside the subsystem , with @xmath5 a big number like @xmath6 , and the kets @xmath7 are the wavefunctions for these variables .",
    "the `` 1 '' or `` 2 '' indicate that these in general depend on the state of the subsystem . now",
    "if we only look at the subsystem and not at the @xmath4 s , that is are only concerned with operators that act on @xmath2 , then all we need to know is the `` reduced '' density matrix of the two - state system .",
    "this is a 2 x 2 matrix which can be expressed  @xcite as follows @xmath8    where the interpretation of this matrix can be given as :    @xmath9    where of course the `` amounts '' are probabilities and are normalized to one : ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the justification for calling the off - diagonal elements the degree of coherence between the two states may be seen by considering two extreme cases : let @xmath11 and @xmath12 be either the same or orthogonal . in the first case",
    "@xmath13 can be factored out in eq  [ [ psi ] ] and @xmath14 is just a product wavefunction ; @xmath15and @xmath16 are completely coherent . in the second case",
    "no operator working just on the @xmath2 subspace can cause the two states to interfere , they are completely incoherent .",
    "if we think of the @xmath4 s as describing an environment in which our subsystem is immersed , we can say that to the degree the subsystem is correlated with the environment , the subsystem is internally incoherent .",
    "finally , this environment could be a `` measuring apparatus '' .",
    "this is something that establishes a correlation  usually a strong one between the state of the subsystem and the @xmath17 , which now represent the `` apparatus '' . in the limit of very strong correlation",
    "we can know what @xmath13 is just by looking at the @xmath17 , which is of course how a measurement instrument should function . on the other hand ,",
    "we thus see how the measurement `` collapses the '' of the subsystem : @xmath15 and @xmath18 become incoherent  @xcite when the @xmath17 states are very different .",
    "an easy and limiting case of incoherence to understand is the thermal state .",
    "the density matrix operator @xmath19 for a thermal state is proportional to @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the hamiltonian operator , @xmath22 the temperature and @xmath23 the boltzmann constant .",
    "looking at this expression you might be inclined to see only the usual boltzmann factor of statistical physics , which it is .",
    "however , more important for our discussion is the fact that it is an _",
    "operator_. furthermore this operator is a function of the hamiltonian operator only , @xmath22 and @xmath23 being just numerical parameters .",
    "this means that there is a definite basis in which @xmath19 is diagonal , namely the basis of energy eigenstates @xmath24 :    @xmath25    this diagonal property has the physical interpretation that different energy eigenstates are _",
    "incoherent_. that is , consider the expectation value of some operator  : @xmath26\\sim c_e \\delta_{e , e'}{\\cal o}_{e , e'}\\sim c_e { \\cal o}_{e , e } \\;,\\ ] ] in words , the contributions to @xmath27 for each energy state are to be added separately and incoherently .",
    "one obvious consequence of this incoherence between energy states is that nothing can be time dependent : as we well know the thermal state is _",
    "stationary_. that is , if we consider the time dependence of any operator @xmath28 in the thermal state we get @xmath29= tr\\bigl[\\rho{\\cal o}\\bigr]= constant \\;,\\ ] ] since we can use the fact that @xmath30 commutes with @xmath19 and the permutation property of the trace to bring the @xmath30 factors together and cancel them .",
    "is the thermal state the only state like this ?",
    "obviously not , for eq  [ [ tra ] ] we see that the important point is eq  [ [ del ] ] , the diagonality , and not the precise value of the @xmath31 .",
    "the above arguments go through for _ any _ @xmath32 and not just eq  [ boltz ] . for this reason we wrote a general coefficient @xmath31 and",
    "not the boltzmann factor .",
    "so if it s not the thermal state , what is the characterizing feature of the  [ [ del ] ] ?",
    "the property which will be true of any state describe by eq[[del ] ] is that it is _",
    "stationary_. since there is no coherence between energy states no operator can show a time dependence .",
    "conversely , if we know on physical grounds that some system is stationary , we know that its energy states are incoherent .",
    "an important case of this is the radiation coming from a thermal source .",
    "the radiation itself , say neutrinos from the sun , need not follow a boltzmann factor .",
    "but since the sun , ( to a very high degree of approximation ) is stationary , we know that different energy states are incoherent . understanding this helped to clear up a long - standing confusion on the treatment of neutrino oscillations  @xcite .",
    "limiting cases like perfect coherence for a pure state , or incoherence of energy states for stationary systems , are easy to understand . however , we are often confronted with the more difficult situation of partial and time - dependent coherence .",
    "typically we imagine the problem of a subsystem in a pure , perfectly coherent , state at @xmath33 ; which as time goes on becomes more incoherent as it interacts with the external world .",
    "although this is in principle a perfectly well defined problem : just go ahead , find the total at any time and average out the unobserved variables by calculating eq  [ [ rhomat ] ] there is no simple way to do this perfectly rigorously for a many - variable system .",
    "we must resort to some kinds of plausible approximations or guesses .",
    "a simple and reasonable picture , from which however we can learn a lot , amounts to assuming that the outer world or environment has steady properties with time and there is a loss of coherence at a constant rate for our subsystem .",
    "formally this is like the `` golden rule '' calculation used in decay problems or scattering theory .",
    "for the two state system as described by eq  [ [ rhomat ] ] we can give a quite complete description of the phenomenology of the problem on this basis and draw a number of interesting conclusions .",
    "to set up the framework for this approach , we first parameterize the 2x2 matrix for @xmath19 in terms of the familiar pauli matrices @xmath34 : @xmath35 which is appropriately normalized to @xmath36 .",
    "the two - state subsystem is governed by an internal hamiltonian which completely describes its behavior in the absence of interaction with the environment .",
    "it is also a 2 x 2 matrix which we can parameterize in the same way :    @xmath37    where we have left out a possible constant term which simple represents an overall energy shift and has no interesting effects .",
    "these are just mathematical definitions , but because of the familiar identification of the pauli matrices with spin , they allow a simple intuitive picture .",
    "the 3-vector @xmath38 is like a `` polarization '' .",
    "according to eq  [ [ pmat ] ] its vertical or `` z '' component represents the relative amounts of the two states `` 1 '' or `` 2 '' .",
    "the `` transverse '' or x - y components , according to eq  [ [ pmat ] ] represent the degree of coherence within the subsystem .",
    "in generalizing to more than two- state systems , this remains true ; the diagonal elements represent the amount of the  quality \" in question and the off - diagonal elements the coherence between them .",
    "note that this is necessarily a basis - dependent picture : we must specify which `` quality '' we are talking about .",
    "naturally if the system is isolated and has no interactions with the outside world the situation is very simple .",
    "the evolution is governed by the above hamiltonian and the equation of motion for @xmath19 given by the basic formula    @xmath39\\ ] ]    using the algebra of the @xmath40 this translates into    @xmath41    pictorially , the `` polarization '' * p * precesses around a `` pseudo - magnetic field '' * v*. note that * v * can be time dependent if we wish .",
    "so far we havent done very much , this is just equivalent to the evolution of a spin in a magnetic field .",
    "observe that with this equation the length of * p * can not change : @xmath42 that is , * p * rotates without shrinking .",
    "this represents the fact that a pure state remains a pure state for an isolated system .",
    "the non - trivial part comes in when we try to handle the interaction with the outside world . as mentioned ,",
    "if we make the assumption of an outside world with constant properties , interacting repeatedly with our subsystem such that there is a steady loss of coherence , that is a constant rate of decrease of the off - diagonal elements , we can obtain a plausible generalization  @xcite of eq  [ [ pdot ] ] .",
    "this has the form    @xmath43    this involves one new parameter , @xmath44 .",
    "this is the damping or decoherence rate and describes the rate of loss of coherence between the two basis states .",
    "@xmath45 means the `` transverse '' or @xmath46 components of * p*. if we mentally turn off the first term in the equation , the @xmath44 term leads to an exponential decay of the overlap or coherence terms in @xmath19 , as in the `` golden rule '' , and this rate is independent of the time when we start .",
    "if our subsystem is immersed in a large essentially infinite system it is difficult to imagine any other behavior .",
    "we have made one inessential simplification in writing eq  [ [ pdota ] ] . in order to concentrate on the interesting interaction between the decoherence and the internal evolution",
    "we have left out a possible term @xmath47 in which there would be a direct relaxation between the two basis states .",
    "for example in the problem of two states of a chiral molecule separated by a barrier  @xcite we are assuming that the temperature is low enough that there is no direct jumping over the barrier .",
    "this is the simple classical relaxation process which can easily be dealt with but is not essentially relevant to the quantum mechanical aspects on which we wish to focus .",
    "similarly , it will be seen that at long times * p * in eq  [ [ pdota ] ] tends to zero .",
    "this may not be exactly correct if the internal hamiltonian is such that there is a constant energy difference between the two basis states , large compared to an ambient temperature .",
    "then @xmath48 should end up being given by the boltzmann factor and not be zero .",
    "so we implicitly make the assumption that any constant component @xmath49 is small compared to the temperature .",
    "the most important aspect of the presence of the damping term is that now the length of @xmath38 can shrink : @xmath50 in general , and so the density matrix can change its `` purity '' .",
    "that is , even without explicitly `` quality changing '' relaxations the length of p will inevitably decrease , if there is a @xmath51 component .",
    "such a component however , will be produced , in general , by the `` rotation '' induced by @xmath52 .",
    "although we shall explain below how to arrive at a microscopic understanding of @xmath44 , even the simple phenomenological eq  [ [ pdota ] ] allows us to arrive at some interesting conclusions .",
    "one of these is the `` zeno effect '' .",
    "the zeno or watched pot effect , perhaps first proposed by alan turing  @xcite , goes something like this . according to the `` copenhagen school '' s treatment of the `` measurement problem '' ( all these things are in `` ... '' because i m not sure they exist ) , a measurement leaves the state of the system in one particular eigenstate of the measurement .",
    "for example after a position measurement , the object is in some definite position  not in a superposition of positions .",
    "so we or turing might say , let s keep rapidly measuring the object s position .",
    "it will repeatedly be fixed to the spot and not be able to move at all !    sometimes this `` paradox '' is used to say there s something wrong with or something of the sort .",
    "but actually it represents perfectly reasonable behavior and in fact is just a solution to eq  [ [ pdota ] ] , for the case of large @xmath44 .    to see this ,",
    "consider the behavior of eq  [ [ pdota ] ] in the case of a constant @xmath52 , say along the x - axis .",
    "if we start @xmath38 along the z - axis , it will tend to rotate in a circle in z - y plane : @xmath48the probabilities or `` amounts '' we have defined as represented by @xmath48 will oscillate . now if we turn on @xmath44 , the oscillations will be damped and gradually die out . as we make @xmath44 larger and larger the oscillations will become overdamped and disappear completely .",
    "finally in the limit of very strong damping one finds  @xcite ,  @xcite    @xmath53    in the limit of large @xmath44 , @xmath48 is practically frozen and will hardly budge from the spot ! according to this formula the time scale , initially set by the oscillation time @xmath54 , gets stretched by a factor @xmath55 , which can be enormous when it turns out @xmath44 is something like the interaction rate in a gas ( see formula for @xmath44 below ) and @xmath54 is the tunneling time between two states of a chiral molecule . in this way we gave a second answer to hund s paradox on the stability of the optical isomers  @xcite ( the first was parity violation  @xcite ) . on a practical level",
    "this means that in relaxation processes at low where the classical barrier - hopping type of mechanisms are frozen out and quantum tunneling takes over , we have `` anti - intuitive '' relaxation , where a bigger @xmath44 means _ slower _",
    "relaxation  @xcite .",
    "you might say the repeated `` measurements '' by the environment have fixed the state a la zeno- watched pot but in any case it s just a result of a simple solution to eq  [ [ pdota ] ] and has nothing mysterious about it .",
    "at this point we should warn of a misunderstanding which sometimes arises .",
    "the arguments , or similar arguments leading to eq  [ [ zeno ] ] or its equivalent , depend very much on our dealing with a system with two , or in any case a finite number of , levels .",
    "they do _ not _ apply to a continuous density of levels , as for the decay of a quasi - stable state into the continuum .",
    "this misunderstanding has occasionally led some people to erroneously suggest that the decay of a particle or atomic or nuclear level could be inhibited by observing if it has decayed or not .",
    "this is obviously silly .",
    "mathematically the difference between the two cases is that with two or finite number of levels @xmath48 has a `` flat - top '' near @xmath33 in the absence of damping .",
    "that is , @xmath56 for small times ; while for a true decay problem we have @xmath57 , a linear behavior .",
    "this leads to qualitatively different behavior with respect to `` stopping and restarting '' the system as we do when we turn on the damping to get the zeno - watched pot behavior .",
    "another nice way of undertanding this ( suggested to me by michael berry ) is to consider the decay process as the tunneling through a barrier , as in the gamow picture of alpha decay .",
    "now , when there is tunneling through a barrier connecting two _ discrete _ states , as in the chiral molecule problem  @xcite , the origin of the zeno - watched pot effect may be understood as follows .",
    "tunneling between two discrete states is a very delicate process and depends very much on the quasi - degeneracy of the energy between the two states . with @xmath58 the energy splitting",
    ", the tunneling probability goes as @xmath59 , with @xmath60 the tunneling energy . since @xmath60 is typically very small ,",
    "so must @xmath58 be small to have a non - neglible tunneling probability .",
    "now if some external influence is causing the energy levels to move around constantly , even by small amounts , say by some shifting of the two potential wells in the two - state tunneling problem , the degeneracy is constantly being lifted and the tunneling is slowed down . depending on the ratio of @xmath61",
    "it can be practically stopped .",
    "this leads to the zeno - watched pot effect .",
    "but the situation is entirely different if we have a quasi - bound state decaying into a _ continuum _ of states , as in the alpha decay situation .",
    "even if the energy of the quasi - bound state is fluctuating , it will always find some continuum state with which it is degenerate .",
    "hence there is no zeno - watched pot effect .",
    "we now come to the microscopic understanding of @xmath44 , the damping or decoherence rate . using our general ideas , we can derive a nice formula for this , which furnishes considerable insight into the `` decoherence '' or  measurement process \" .    from its definition in eq  [ [ pdota ] ] and",
    "looking at eq  [ [ pmat ] ] we see that @xmath44 is a rate parameter , one which gives the rate at which the overlap between @xmath12 and @xmath11 is decreasing with time .",
    "we take our subsystem to be interacting with the big environment in a constant , steady manner ",
    "this is implicit in our assumption of a constant @xmath44 with no further time dependence .",
    "we can model this situation by looking at the subsystem as being bombarded by a constant flux from the environment .",
    "this may be thought of as particles , or excitations like phonons or quasiparticles .",
    "our basic idea is that if the two states 1 and 2 of the subsystem scatter this incoming flux in a way which is different for 1 and 2 , then the overlap @xmath62 decreases .",
    "we recall the concept of the @xmath63 matrix of scattering theory .",
    "this is an operator which turns the incoming wavefunction into the outgoing wavefunction :    @xmath64    now the important point here is that states 1 and 2 may scatter the incoming differently , so we have two @xmath63 matrices , @xmath65 and @xmath66  @xcite . if these are different the incoming particle or excitation , which was _",
    "un_correlated with the state of the subsystem before the scattering , will be correlated with it afterwards .",
    "so every scattering decreases the overlap and if we work out what this means for @xmath44 we get the following formula : @xmath67    the expression is proportional to the incoming flux since it is a rate parameter and @xmath68 refers to the incoming state , with a possible average implied if we have many kinds of incoming states .",
    "`` i m '' means imaginary part .",
    "there is also a significance to the real part , which is an energy shift of the subsystem induced by the environment  @xcite .",
    "since usually we have @xmath69 for the @xmath63 matrix , the formula says that the decoherence rate is related to the `` unitarity deficit '' produced by the fact that the different components of the subsystem do nt interact the same way with the outside world .",
    "eq  [ [ d ] ] has two illuminating limits :    @xmath70    if both states of the subsystem interact equally with the outer world , @xmath71 , there is no decoherence .",
    "this is in accord with our feelings about `` measurement '' .",
    "if the `` outside '' does not respond to the differences in the subsystem there is no `` measurement '' and no `` reduction '' of the state .",
    "however , we do not need to use this language , the equation stands by itself .",
    "note an important point : interaction with the environment is possible without decoherence .",
    "the other interesting limit occurs if one state , say 1 , does nt interact so @xmath72 then @xmath73 this result follows from an application of the optical theorem of scattering theory @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "this corresponds to the naive expectation that the decoherence rate is the scattering rate .",
    "this is just one particular limit however , and there can be subtleties such as effects of phases on @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "there ia a classical conundrum which says , in apparent contradiction to common sense , that the entropy of a isolated system can not increase .",
    "this is particularly simple to show in  where the definition of entropy is @xmath76 $ ] . since for an isolated system the evolution of @xmath19",
    "is governed by a hamiltonian , we get for the time dependence of the entropy , just as in eq .",
    "( [ tra ] ) , @xmath77= tr\\bigl[\\rho\\ , ln \\rho\\bigr]= constant$ ] .",
    "this argument says that as long as the time dependence of @xmath19 is governed by a hamiltonian , the entropy is constant .",
    "this constancy would also apply to the entropy @xmath78 $ ] of our two - state system where @xmath19 is given by eq .",
    "( [ rhomata ] ) if it were isolated not coupled to the environment . or",
    "as we learn from the argument , it could even be coupled to the environment ; but in such a way that the evolution of @xmath19 is given by a hamiltonian .",
    "however we see from eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) that the coupling to the environmnet is not governed by a single hamiltonian but rather by two hamiltonians , giving the two @xmath63 matrices .",
    "if we had one hamiltonian we would have @xmath79 , in which case @xmath71 , and there is no decoherence .",
    "hence there is a connection between @xmath44 and the entropy increase of the two state system .",
    "in fact diagonalizing eq .",
    "( [ rhomata ] ) and taking the trace , we find for the entropy @xmath80=ln { 2}-{1\\over 2}\\bigl((1+p)ln(1+p)+(1-p)ln(1-p)\\bigr)$ ] . taking the time derivative , we find for the entropy change of the two state system    @xmath81    where we used eq .",
    "( [ shr ] ) .",
    "the @xmath82 refers to the limit of small @xmath83 .",
    "it seems intuitively clear that the rate of entropy increase and the decoherence rate should be closely related and eq .",
    "( [ ent ] ) expresses this quantitatively . by appropriate generalization of the various quantities ,",
    "this could be extended to systems larger than just two states .",
    "note @xmath84 is necessarily positive .",
    "furthermore , in thermal equilibrium where there is no coherence between states of different energy i.e @xmath85 , there is no entropy production .",
    "in recent years our subject has moved from the theoretical- philosophical to the domain of the almost practical with the realization of quantum behavior for large , essentially macroscopic devices``mesoscopic systems '' .",
    "this has been given additional impetus in view of the possible use of such devices for the implementation of the `` quantum computer '' .",
    "furthermore the subject is interesting in connection with the idea  to my mind wrong  that there might be some limit where large objects do nt obey the rules of quantum mechanics .",
    "decoherence is of course the main question for the observability of such effects and their possible practical use .",
    "one of the devices that has been studied in detail is the rf squid , where by suitable adjustment of parameters it is possible to bring the system into the configuration of the familiar double potential well separated by a tunneling barrier .",
    "the `` x '' coordinate stands for the flux in the superconducting ring , and the system obeys  in the absence of decoherence a schroedinger equation in this variable .",
    "the states localized in one of the potential wells represent the supercurrent flowing in a given sense around the ring , with a very large number ( microamps ) of electrons reversing direction when we go from one well to the other .",
    "creation of quantum linear combinations of these states , which can occur by tunneling , would certainly be impressive evidence for the general applicabilty of quantum mechanics .",
    "some beautiful experiments  @xcite  @xcite using microwave technique have seen evidence for such combinations in squid systems .",
    "we have suggested  @xcite a particularly simple way to both see the quantum linear combination of the two states and to measure the decoherence time of the system , hopefully directly sensitive only to the true quantum decoherence .",
    "it involves the idea of `` adiabatic inversion '' .",
    "this occurs when a slowly varying external field can cause a quantum system to reverse its state , as when a spin `` follows '' a rotating magnetic field and goes from up to down .",
    "this phenomenon is also often refered to as a `` level crossing '' .",
    "it is an intrinsically quantum mechanical phenomenon and , important for us is hindered when the decoherence time is short compared to the time in which the inversion takes place .",
    "we propose to produce such an inversion in the squid by sweeping an external field and then observing the reversal of the direction of the flux in the squid .",
    "note that the system need not be `` observed '' until the procedure is over  our method is `` noninvasive '' .",
    "when the sweep is faster than the decoherence time the inversion should take place , and when it is slower it should be inhibited .",
    "we are witnessing the transition from quantum ( tunneling allowed ) to classical ( tunneling forbidden ) behavior as the decoherence is increased .",
    "going from fast to slow sweeps , the sweep time where the inversion begins to become unsuccesful thus gives a determination of the decoherence time .",
    "a possible difficulty here is that the sweep can not be too fast , otherwise the procedure becomes non - adiabatic .",
    "however , our estimates indicate that a region of squid parameters and temperature should exist where fast - enough sweeps are possible without violating adiabaticity .",
    "in order to study these points in more detail we have developed numerical simulations of such systems , both for the study of the adiabatic inversion ( the logical not ) as well as for a two - squid system operating as a cnot quantum logic gate  @xcite . in fig  1",
    "we show the results of a simulation  @xcite for the one - squid adiabatic inversion .",
    "the decoherence time @xmath86 was chosen to be about 39 000 units and simulated as a random flux noise .",
    "the squid parameters were @xmath87 , giving a time unit of @xmath88 and so @xmath89 .",
    "this decoherence time would correspond to about @xmath90 in the estimate @xmath91 , with @xmath92  @xcite .",
    "the simulation included the first 8 quantum levels of the squid so that possible effects of non- adiabaticity are taken into account .",
    "the vertical axis in fig 1 shows the probability for finding the flux in the ring reversed after the sweep .",
    "we see that while the inversion is essentially always successful for sweep times less than decoherence time , it becomes progressively less so for longer sweeps .",
    "hence we are seeing the transition from quantum towards classical behavior , and a measuremnt of when this takes place furnishes a determination of the decoherence time . the gradual fall - off seen after",
    "the completion of the longest sweep is indicative of another difficulty , relaxation .",
    "our final states will in general not be distributed according to thermal equilibrium , and the final detection should take place quickly on the time scale for relaxation .",
    "although the above ideas are rather simple and phenomenological , they can be applied to a wide variety of interesting problems , where of course the various quantities like @xmath52 and @xmath93 must be adapted to each particular case .",
    "these range from understanding the permanence of optical or `` chiral '' isomers ( hund s paradox )  @xcite , to the study of neutrino oscillations  @xcite , to the mesoscopic devices  @xcite ,  @xcite , and the design of quantum logic gates  @xcite just discussed .    here",
    ", however , i would like to conclude in a more speculative vein , coming back to the question of the need for coherence between energy states to define time .",
    "is the loss of coherence always a more or less accidental happening , depending on the particulars of the situation ? or is there something universal about it ?",
    "there is of course one kind of interaction which universally and inevitably couples to energy states and which in principle `` measures '' or distinguishes them : gravity  @xcite .",
    "gravity couples to mass / energy and so states of different mass / energy interact differently .",
    "indeed one can derive the gravitational redshift by considering the @xmath1 meson `` clock ''  @xcite .    for this clock",
    ", we have two mass / energy eigenstates and interference effects between them tell time . by the same token",
    "this must imply some degree of decoherence between the different mass / energy states due to gravitational interactions .",
    "there ought to be an imaginary or dispersive part to the redshift . naturally because the coupling , newton s constant , is so small we expect the effects to be negligible under everyday conditions .",
    "it is nevertheless amusing to see what the formulas look like .",
    "we shall incidentally find that there is in fact an `` everyday '' application , involving the passage of oscillating neutrinos near galaxies .",
    "qualitatively , we expect in regions of large and rapidly varying gravitational fields that different energy states become incoherent . since gravity couples universally , this can not be dismissed as an incidental effect .",
    "it will affect all energy states , and thus time is slowed down equally for all processes .",
    "if the effects become strong , time in some sense becomes ill - defined or stands still .",
    "we try to model the due to gravity by calculating @xmath44 for the @xmath1 clock .",
    "there are two interfering mass eigenstates and an environment interacting gravitationally with these two states .",
    "if we take this environment to be a flux of particles , we can use our formula eq  [ [ d ] ] .",
    "the calculation of the s matrices is ( non relativistically ) the same as for coulomb scattering , where the `` charge '' is the mass .",
    "the two components of the clock have different masses @xmath94 and so @xmath93 are different and thus there is a contribution to @xmath44 . in an impact parameter representation we have          where @xmath98 , with g the newton constant and @xmath99 the energy of the incoming particle . as is usual in coulomb problems",
    "there is a divergence at large distances , and so we introduce a large distance cutoff @xmath100 which must be interpreted according to the physical conditions . taking the two @xmath63 s and the imaginary part we finally get      with @xmath102 , which we have taken to be small and expanded to lowest order .",
    "@xmath103 is @xmath104 .",
    "we can try to estimate this under thermal conditions , as in the early universe , where all dimensional quantities are related to the temperature @xmath22 .",
    "we end up with @xmath105 as would have been expected , t must be at least on the order of the planck scale for this to be significant .",
    "and then the rate is @xmath106 , which is still small , unless we are considering @xmath103 also on the planck scale .",
    "the result eq  [ [ difin ] ] is of order @xmath107 since decoherence , as explained , is a unitarity effect and so comes in to second order in the coupling .",
    "although conceptually interesting this seems very remote from any potentially observable effects .",
    "nevertheless there is , as promised , a  present - day \" application .",
    "we now know there are neutrino oscillations .",
    "so possibly if the time scale for the release of the neutrinos in the big bang were short compared to their oscillation time ( then ) , they would still be oscillating in step today . instead of the @xmath1 clock",
    "we have a neutrino clock . a beautiful clock  if we could ever read it  a precise timepiece going back to the very first minutes of the big bang .",
    "but there s a difficulty : in traveling to us the neutrinos will pass near various mass and gravitational field inhomogeneities , like galaxies , and these will tend to mix up the phases . because of the huge mass of a galaxy , @xmath108 will no longer be small .",
    "one finds  @xcite , with typical mass parameters for neutrinos and galaxies , that essentially any neutrino traveling through or near a galaxy will be decohered .",
    "unfortunately , there will be no oscillations to read .",
    "so much for the big bang clock , but at least there s a `` practical '' application of theory involving gravity .    note that these ideas , based on the different interaction of different mass / energy states , do not contradict the classical equivalence principle according to which different masses move in the same way .",
    "the interaction is so cleverly constructed that while different masses follow the same path classically , they get different quantum phases  @xcite , and these are essentially what concern us here .",
    "the interplay between the classical and quantum is subtle and interesting .",
