    "contrarily to the microwave - optical double resonance scheme , coherent population trapping ( cpt ) does not require a microwave cavity , which may be an advantage in compact or miniature atomic clocks @xcite .",
    "cpt usually suffers from smaller signal contrast , even though different techniques have been recently proposed to overcome this potential limitation [ 3 - 6 ] .    in this communication",
    "we present our study on the use of cpt in vapour cell frequency standards .",
    "we have investigated the case of @xmath2rb d@xmath3 when a longitudinal magnetic field is applied and the cpt is excited by a linearly polarized , unidirectional and multi - frequency light field @xmath4the so called lin@xmath5lin cpt@xmath6 [ 7 - 10 ] . here below the experimental setup is shortly described . in section two",
    "we present the signal shape for different values of magnetic field and we discuss the maximum contrast achievable in our configuration . in section three , the role of the laser frequency detuning , the noise measurements and determination of the optimal lock - in detection frequency are discussed . finally , we predict the achievable clock frequency stability , basing our considerations on the presented signal - to - noise measurements .    figure [ fig : setup ] shows our setup .",
    "the rb atoms are confined in a cylindrical glass cell ( volume 1 @xmath7 ) placed in a cylindrical magnetic shield ( volume 40 @xmath7 ) .",
    "a longitudinal magnetic field ( b@xmath8 ) is provided by a solenoid placed inside the magnetic shield , b@xmath8 is parallel to the laser beam propagation vector .",
    "the experiments were performed by using two cells containing either @xmath9 or @xmath10 kpa of nitrogen as buffer gas ; higher buffer gas pressure in the cell are not suitable because of the suppression of quadrupole transitions due to the excited state mixing induced by the buffer gas .",
    "remark that this intrinsic characteristic prohibits the application of the lin@xmath5lin cpt in miniature - clocks unless wall - coating is used , because in the mini - cells ( volume @xmath11 mm@xmath12 ) a buffer gas pressure of several tens of kpa is necessary .",
    "lin cpt.,width=264 ]    the multi - frequency optical spectrum is generated via modulation of the injection current of a single mode vcsel chip emitting around 795 nm @xcite .",
    "the vcsel used in this experiment has a linewidth of ( 100@xmath1320 ) mhz , measured from a heterodyne beatnote . during the experiments the vcsel was modulated at the frequency of 3.417 ghz ( i.e. half of ground state hyperfine separation in @xmath2rb ) with a power of 10 dbm .",
    "we estimated the spectral properties of the modulated vcsel by recording the @xmath2rb one - photon absorption for different modulation frequencies and amplitudes .",
    "we did not observe effects related to amplitude modulation .",
    "the phase modulation index was about 1.8 , corresponding to about 70@xmath14 of the total laser power in the 1st order side - bands , which are used for cpt preparation .",
    "the remaining power is distributed in the carrier , 2nd and 3rd order side - bands , and essentially does not contribute to the cpt signal but increases the dc `` background '' level on the photo - detector , induces ac stark shift and contributes to one - photon absorption processes .",
    "figure [ fig : int ] shows the relevant atomic levels and possible transitions for the @xmath2rb d@xmath3 line induced by the @xmath15 and @xmath16 components of the linearly polarized light fields .",
    "we focus our attention on the group of transitions from the ground state f@xmath17 towards the excited state f@xmath18 = 1 because the maximum contrast is expected in this configuration @xcite . for the application in frequency standards",
    "we take into account the resonances less sensitive to the magnetic field , i.e. the cpt signal occurring between ground state zeeman sublevels with m@xmath19 and m@xmath20 .",
    "remark that , in the case of linear polarization , the @xmath21 and @xmath22 groups of transitions starting from the ground state zeeman sublevels with m@xmath19 , give rise to two orthogonal cpt states which interfere destructively and do not contribute to the cpt signal . as a consequence",
    ", we have to consider only the two cpt states created by the coherent superposition of @xmath23f@xmath24 , m@xmath25 and @xmath23f@xmath26 , m@xmath27 , represented by the dashed and solid line in figure [ fig : int](b ) , respectively .",
    "these two cpt states are symmetrically split by the magnetic field with a factor of @xmath1328 hz @xmath28t@xmath29 determined by the nuclear g - factor , and are both shifted by a factor of 0.043 hz @xmath28t@xmath30 .",

    "( a ) represents all @xmath15 and @xmath16 allowed transitions ; while ( b ) represents the transitions contributing to the resonance approaching the b@xmath31 resonance frequency.,width=264 ]    in principle , the sensitivity to the magnetic field makes these cpt states not suitable for atomic clocks .",
    "however , their supposed high contrast drove several studies of their metrological properties [ 7 - 10 ] .",
    "the first observation of the cpt resonance splitting due to the nuclear g - factor , is reported for cs atoms in reference @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", we have presented a detailed theoretical analysis of the lin@xmath5lin cpt lineshape and proposed to use as frequency discriminator the maximum of absorption between the two cpt peaks when degeneracy is removed ( so - called pseudo - resonance ) .",
    "zibrov and co - workers @xcite accounted for measuring the main metrological characteristic of the degenerate lin@xmath5lin cpt and pseudo - resonance . in their experimental setup , the multi - frequency spectrum was obtained by modulating the current of a diode laser which was injection locked by the radiation of a single mode ecdl .",
    "therefore , our study constitutes the first experimental evaluation of the achievable clock frequency stability with lin@xmath5lin cpt in a single laser compact set - up .",
    "figure [ fig : dis ] shows typical degenerate cpt and pseudo - resonance signals obtained in our experiments : in figure [ fig : dis](a ) , the relative magnetic shift ( @xmath32 ) between the two cpt states is smaller than their linewidth ( @xmath33 ) . in this case",
    "the two cpt states are degenerate and their signals merge . in figure",
    "[ fig : dis](b ) , the b@xmath8 applied is such as @xmath34 , as a consequence the cpt degeneracy is removed and the pseudo - resonance signal appears .",
    "@xmath28 t ) and pseudo - resonance ( b@xmath35 @xmath28 t ) signals and their correspondent discriminator signals obtained by phase - sensitive detection.,width=264 ]    note that @xmath36 determines the b@xmath8 to apply for obtaining the maximum pseudo - resonance amplitude , which corresponds to the amplitude of the non - degenerate cpt ( a@xmath37= a@xmath38 ) .",
    "considering that , in our experimental conditions , the cpt signal is well approximated by a lorentzian function , a@xmath37= a@xmath38 means @xmath39 @xmath36 .",
    "since the amplitude of the non - degenerate cpt is smaller than the amplitude of the degenerate cpt , the optimal discriminator slope for pseudo - resonance will be approximately 3 times worse than the degenerate cpt discriminator slope .    in figure",
    "[ fig : dis ] the cpt signal contrast , defined as the ratio between the cpt amplitude and dc level on the photodetector , is less than @xmath40 . by optimizing the experimental parameters ( buffer gas pressure , cell temperature , laser diameter ) in our setup , a maximum contrast of @xmath41 has been recorded .",
    "these values are noticeably smaller than the contrast obtained with the optical microwave double resonance . the main limiting factor to reach a higher cpt contrast",
    "is connected with the choice of creating the multi - frequency spectrum by a direct modulation of the vcsel injection current .",
    "whith this technique , when the amplitude of the @xmath42-order sidebands is maximized , the @xmath43 of the total laser power is distributed in the carrier and higher order sidebands .",
    "considering that the distance between two consecutive frequencies in the optical spectrum is about @xmath44 ghz and the typical doppler linewidth is about @xmath45 ghz ; in cpt resonance conditions , most of the power of the carrier and higher order sidebands pass trough the cell without being absorbed by @xmath2rb atoms , increasing significantly the background photodetector signal .",
    "let us consider , for instance , the case of figure [ fig : dis ] : the total laser power was about @xmath46 @xmath28w of which @xmath47 @xmath28w contributed mainly to the photodetector background signal .",
    "whith the photodetector sensitivity of about @xmath48 a w@xmath29 , the background signal due to the carrier and the higher order sidebands is roughly @xmath49 @xmath28a . in principle , a degenerate lin@xmath5lin cpt contrast up to @xmath50 may be reached using a pure bichromatic field .",
    "a comparison of lin@xmath5lin cpt for the laser locked to either f@xmath18=1 or f@xmath18=2 group of transitions has been presented in @xcite , where the authors showed that the group of transitions towards f@xmath18=1 results in larger a@xmath38 and narrower @xmath36 . in order to determine the optimal laser detuning for frequency standard applications , we studied d@xmath51(a@xmath52 ) versus the laser detuning ( @xmath53 ) around the group of transitions towards f@xmath18=1 ( figure [ fig : disvdet ] ) .    ) for two cells filled with different buffer gas pressure , @xmath9 and @xmath10 kpa , respectively .",
    "@xmath53 = 0 refers to the absorption f@xmath54 f@xmath55 in an evacuated @xmath2rb cell.the shift of the d maximum depends on both the pressure shift ( dotted line ) and broadening of the d@xmath3 line.,width=264 ]    we observe that the laser detuning corresponding to the maximum of d depends on the buffer gas pressure in the cell . by comparing experimental and theoretical results , we pointed out that both the pressure shift and broadening of the @xmath2rb d@xmath3 influence the lin@xmath5lin cpt signal . in the case of a cell containing a n@xmath56 pressure of @xmath10 kpa , for instance",
    ", the maximum value of d corresponds to a detuning of about @xmath57 mhz , while the pressure shift is only @xmath58 mhz ( lower plot in figure [ fig : disvdet ] ) .",
    "we interpret this difference as a results of the destructive quantum interference between cpt states occurring when both levels f@xmath55 and f@xmath59 are excited simultaneously .",
    "if the laser is tuned resonant to f@xmath18=1 , the influence of the transition towards f@xmath18=2 is due to the pressure broadening of the hyperfine transitions and/or the laser linewidth .",
    "further experiments are in progress to quantify the dependence of the quantum interference on the experimental parameters .",
    "the short term stability of an atomic clock depends on the parameters of the reference signal ( a@xmath38 , @xmath33 ) , the resonance frequency ( @xmath60 ) and the detection noise ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "it can be evaluated by the allan deviation , @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "the noise power spectrum has been measured for different the laser detuning ( @xmath53 ) in our setup , using the cell filled with @xmath2rb and 1.5 mbar of n@xmath56 ( figure [ fig : noise ] ) .",
    "we observed that the detection noise level depends on the laser frequency detuning : when the laser is resonant with the rb absorption the detection noise level increases significantly , indicating that the dominant contribution to the detection noise is the laser fm - to - am conversion @xcite .",
    "rb d@xmath3 line.,width=264 ]    at higher frequency the detection noise is noticeably reduced : a factor 20 when changing @xmath63 from @xmath48 khz to @xmath64 khz for the laser tuned to the absorption peak . as a consequence",
    "it could be convenient for cpt - based atomic clocks to work with a lock - in modulation frequency ( @xmath63 ) up to several tens of khz . in this case",
    "the @xmath63 is larger than the linewidth of the monitored signal @xcite , which can not be implemented in the micro - wave optical double resonance clock scheme as presently used . on the contrary , in reference @xcite",
    ", the authors showed that it is possible realize a cpt clock using @xmath65 . in our experimental conditions we verified that @xmath63 up to 40 khz can be used for phase - sensitive detection when @xmath33 is about @xmath66 khz .",
    "we record a reduction of the discriminator signal amplitude by a factor @xmath67 when we changed @xmath63 from @xmath48 khz to @xmath64 khz",
    ". therefore the signal - to - noise ratio results @xmath68 times larger at @xmath69 khz than @xmath70 khz .    in table [ tab1 ] we show the expected optimal short term stability for the cell containing 1.5 mbar of n@xmath56 .",
    "the notable difference between the theoretical and experimental short term stability is mainly due to the fact that the theoretical estimation assumed that the shot noise limit may be reached .",
    "moreover , there is a difference between the measured and calculated cpt amplitude because the model is based on a pure bichromatic electromagnetic field , i.e. in the calculation the losses due to the 1-photon absorption of the vcsel frequencies other than the first - order sidebands are neglected .",
    "the experimental results presented are limited by the laser power : with our vcsel and the optimal beam diameter ( 0.8 cm ) the maximum laser intensity ( i ) was 0.1 mw cm@xmath30 . following the model , the optimal should be i@xmath72 mw cm@xmath30 , corresponding to a shot noise limited short term stability @xmath73 .",

    "we report on our study on the lin@xmath5lin cpt for applications in compact and high performance atomic clocks .",
    "we discuss the two relevant cases : degenerate cpt and pseudo - resonance .",
    "we showed that a @xmath75 10@xmath76 at @xmath66 second may be reached using the degenerate lin@xmath5lin cpt signal and a compact setup .",
    "this value is comparable to the short - term - stability of commercial compact atomic clocks . on the contrary",
    "the short - term stability of a pseudo - resonance clock may be about @xmath77 10@xmath78 at @xmath66 s. according to the model , the expected short - term stability is limited by the choice of the laser source and could be improved by using a pure bichromatic fields with higher laser power ( up to @xmath48 mw cm@xmath30 ) .",
