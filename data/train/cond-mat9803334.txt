    "propagation and localization of waves of various kinds in one - dimensional disordered media have been studied intensively for several decades .",
    "examples of particular interest are _ classical _ electromagnetic wave propagation in random dielectric media @xcite and _ quantum _ electron transport in disordered solids @xcite . much recent attention has been paid to the problem of wave propagation in coherently absorbing or amplifying random media @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the wave is more strongly localized in both types of media than in unitary ( or elastic ) random media with no absorption and amplification .",
    "a large number of previous studies have been based on the so - called random phase approximation ( rpa ) , where it is assumed that the phase of the reflected wave relative to that of the incident wave is uniformly and randomly distributed over all angles .",
    "one can easily prove that this approximation is equivalent to assuming large wave energy or weak disorder , and , at the same time , weak absorption or amplification . when these conditions are not met , an exact calculation beyond the random phase approximation is required .",
    "recently , several authors have performed numerical calculation of the probability densities of the transmittance , the reflectance , and the phase of the complex reflection coefficient in absorbing , amplifying and unitary random media using methods that goes beyond the random phase approximation @xcite .",
    "their results clearly indicate that the random phase approximation can often lead to qualitatively wrong conclusions on the behavior of waves in random media . above all",
    ", it has been demonstrated that the distribution of the phase of the reflection coefficient is generally nonuniform in all of absorbing , amplifying and unitary media .",
    "the distribution of the reflectance is also quite different from the rpa result .",
    "for example , the average reflectance in the rpa is a monotonically decreasing function of the absorption parameter , whereas the exact average reflectance is a nonmonotonic one @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we develop a novel and powerful method of @xmath0 calculating various disorder - averaged quantities including the reflectance , the transmittance , and their probability densities in absorbing , amplifying and unitary media .",
    "we also calculate the probability density of the phase of the reflection coefficient and the localization length exactly .",
    "in addition , we derive a couple of exact dual relationships that relate the probability densities in the absorbing case to those in the amplifying case with the same magnitude of the imaginary part of the dielectric permeability . from the quantitative analysis of the average reflectance in the absorbing case",
    ", we obtain a useful criterion for the applicability of the rpa .",

    "we take this direction as the @xmath3-axis and assume the medium lies in @xmath4 .",

    "we suppose @xmath15 to be a gaussian random function with zero mean and a white - noise spectrum : @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes an average over disorder and the constant @xmath18 is a measure of the strength of randomness . the imaginary part of the dielectric permeability , @xmath14 , makes the medium absorb ( @xmath19 ) or amplify ( @xmath20 ) the wave without destroying its phase coherence . for simplicity",
    ", @xmath14 is assumed to be uniform .",
    "the constant @xmath21 is the disorder average of the real part of the dielectric permeability and , in general , is not equal to 1 .",
    "our method is applicable to the cases where @xmath13 is an arbitrary nonrandom function , e.g. a periodic function , of @xmath3 , but in this paper , we restrict our attention to the case where @xmath13 is a constant .",

    ", the electron wave function @xmath22 plays the same role as @xmath23 and @xmath9 is replaced by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the random potential experienced by electrons and @xmath26 is the kinetic energy of incident electrons .",
