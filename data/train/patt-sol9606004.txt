    "the one dimensional scalar reaction - diffusion equation @xmath3 with @xmath4 has been the subject of much study not only because it models different phenomena @xcite , but also because it is the simplest reaction - diffusion equation for which rigorous results can be obtained @xcite .",
    "depending on the situation being considered the reaction term @xmath1 satisfies additional properties .",
    "it has been shown for different classes of reaction terms that suitable initial conditions @xmath5 evolve in time into a monotonic front joining the state @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "the asymptotic speed at which the front travels is the minimal speed for which a traveling monotonic front @xmath8 exists @xcite .",
    "traveling fronts are a solution of the ordinary differential equation @xmath9 . in the present case",
    "we shall be concerned with two types of reaction terms , the classical case @xmath10 in @xmath11 with @xmath12 and the bistable case @xmath13 in @xmath14 , @xmath15 in @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in the classical case",
    "there is a continuum of speeds @xmath19 for which monotonic fronts exist .",
    "the system evolves into the front of speed @xmath20 . in the bistable case",
    "there is a unique isolated value of the speed @xmath20 for which a monotonic front exists , the system evolves into this front .",
    "the problem is to determine the speed of propagation of the front . in the classical case ,",
    "if in addition @xmath21 the speed of propagation @xmath20 is the so called linear or kpp value @xmath22 @xcite . in the other cases ( as well as in the bistable case ) there exist variational principles both local and integral from which the speed can be calculated with any desired accuracy for arbitrary @xmath23 @xcite .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    "goriely proposes a new method for the determination of the speed .",
    "based on an observed property of some exactly solvable cases , namely reaction terms of the form @xmath24 he conjectures that for polynomial reaction terms of the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 and the polynomial @xmath27 independent of @xmath28 , the speed of the front can be calculated from the knowledge of the heteroclinic orbit of the hamiltonian system @xmath29 this property of solvable cases had not been observed before .",
    "the purpose of this article is to show by means of a counterexample that this conjecture is not true in general for the above class of polynomial reaction terms .",
    "however , considering that the conjecture is indeed true for a large class of reaction terms ( the solvable cases mentioned above ) , it is a very interesting unsolved problem to characterize the class of functions for which it is valid . for the sake of clarity we state the conjecture here .",
    "the conjecture makes use of the fact the front approaches the equilibrium state @xmath30 as @xmath31 , a well established fact , and approaches the equilibrium point @xmath32 as @xmath33 , an assumption which is not always satisfied .",
    "then the global resonance , defined as @xmath34 is conjectured to be a constant , for a general class of polynomial reaction terms , at all values of @xmath28 for which the nonlinear front exists .",
    "explicit expressions are known for the rates of approach @xmath35 and @xmath36 in terms of @xmath37 and @xmath23 therefore , if @xmath38 can be calculated at any point , then an analytic formula for the speed can be obtained .",
    "there is such a point where it can be calculated , and that is the point at which @xmath39 and the system is hamiltonian . there is a unique value @xmath40 for which such a front exists , ( we shall label it as @xmath41 and the corresponding equilibrium point as @xmath42 ) and therefore the speed is completely determined . in the following section we consider a specific polynomial reaction term and show that it fails to satisfy the conjecture .",
    "consider the reaction term @xmath43 this is of the form @xmath44 where the polynomial @xmath45 satisfies the properties @xmath46 and is independent of @xmath28 as requested by the conjecture .",
    "for the hamiltonian system @xmath47 a heteroclinic orbit joining two equilibrium points exists at the value @xmath48 . in fig .",
    "1 the reaction term @xmath1 is shown together with the ( scaled ) potential .",
    "it is clear that a heteroclinic solution joining the point @xmath30 to @xmath49 exists . in this case",
    "the resonance @xmath38 can be calculated .",
    "its value is given by @xmath50 let us now consider the propagating fronts which are a solution of @xmath51 before giving the results of the numerical and analytical calculations we show the plot of the function @xmath23 at several values of @xmath28 which will make clear the numerical and analytical results that follow .",
    "as @xmath28 increases the equilibrium point @xmath52 increases until at @xmath53 it reaches the value @xmath54 where @xmath55 . above this value of @xmath28",
    "there is a discontinuous jump in @xmath52 , the front joins the origin @xmath30 to a new fixed point which corresponds to a different root of the polynomial @xmath1 . in fig .",
    "2 we show the function @xmath23 at different values of @xmath28 . at @xmath53 the fixed point @xmath54 and the derivative @xmath56 . at @xmath57 , we see that the value of @xmath52 is now the new root of @xmath23 which did not exist at low values of @xmath28 .",
    "first we describe the results of the numerical integrations of the initial value problem for eq([eq : pde ] ) with sufficiently localized initial value perturbations @xmath5 .",
    "the speed is obtained numerically and the value of @xmath38 is then computed from eq.([eq : delta ] ) which can be expressed as @xcite @xmath58 in fig .",
    "3 we show the asymptotic speed of the front as a function of @xmath28 .",
    "the solid line gives the numerical results and the dashed line corresponds to the linear or kpp value @xmath59 .",
    "first we observe that the kpp value is lower than the calculated speed in the range of @xmath28 shown which means that the transition to the linear or kpp regime occurs at larger values of @xmath28 . even though the value of @xmath52 is discontinuous",
    ", the speed is a continuous function of @xmath28 .    and",
    "finally the graph of the resonance @xmath38 as a function of @xmath28 is shown in fig .",
    "4 . at @xmath60",
    "it adopts the analytically calculated value from the hamiltonian case , decreases to a value @xmath61 at @xmath53 jumps discontinuously to a larger value and increases from there on .",
    "this discontinuity can be attributed to the discontinuity in @xmath52 . at the value of @xmath53 where @xmath56 it is evident from eq ( [ eq : fordel ] ) that @xmath62 . as we will show below , at this value of @xmath28",
    "the speed and the asymptotic behavior for the front can be calculated analytically and it is found that the front does not approach the fixed point @xmath63 exponentially , therefore one of the assumptions of the conjecture does not hold .",
    "indeed we shall show that at @xmath53 the front approaches @xmath64 as @xmath65 .    in order to determine the speed we shall make use of variational principles .",
    "it is known that the speed of the front is given by @xcite @xmath66 where the maximum is taken over positive decreasing functions @xmath67 .",
    "taking as a trial function @xmath68}\\ ] ] the integrals in eq.([eq : var1 ] ) can be performed .",
    "we obtain for @xmath53 @xmath69 to obtain an upper bound we make use of the local variational principle @xcite @xmath70 where the trial function @xmath71 and @xmath72 . choosing as a trial function @xmath73 we obtain",
    "the upper bound @xmath74 which combined with the above lower bound implies that the speed is exactly @xmath75 in agreement with the results of the numerical integration .",
    "the exact value of the speed could be obtained analytically from the variational principles due to the fact that for @xmath53 the derivative of the front can be calculated exactly .",
    "the derivative of the front as a function of @xmath76 , @xmath77 satisfies the equation @xmath78 and the exact solution at @xmath53 is given by @xmath79 . with this expression for @xmath80",
    "we may calculate the approach to the fixed point @xmath81 .",
    "near @xmath81 , @xmath82 so that @xmath83 from where it follows that @xmath84 we see then that at this point @xmath61 since the rate of approach is not exponential but algebraic and one of the assumptions of the conjecture is not satisfied .",
    "we conclude from this example that the conjecture does not hold for general polynomials of the form given by eq.([eq : fhyp ] ) .",
    "we have seen by means of a counterexample that the conjecture put forward that relates certain properties of the hamiltonian system @xmath85 with the speed of the front solution of @xmath86 is not satisfied by general polynomial reaction terms @xmath1 . as observed by goriely",
    ", there is a class of reaction terms for which it does hold , those for which an exact solution for the front @xmath87 can be given explicitly .",
    "numerical evidence has been given @xcite in at least one case where the conjecture seems to hold in a case where the front can not be calculated explicitly .",
    "on the other hand , we have given a counterexample to this conjecture .",
    "it is an interesting problem to establish precisely the conditions under which the proposed conjecture holds .",
    "this would lead to a classification of systems in at least three classes , those for which the speed is given in terms of the derivative at one fixed point , that is the kpp value @xmath88 , those in which the speed would be determined by the derivatives at the two fixed points ( the expression given by goriely would hold ) and the rest , for which the speed depends on integral properties of the reaction term .",
    "this work was partially supported by fondecyt project 1960450 .",
    "graph of the reaction term at different values of @xmath28 . the value of the stable point increases with @xmath28 until @xmath28 reaches @xmath89 .",

    "graph of the speed obtained from the numerical integration of the initial value problem .",
