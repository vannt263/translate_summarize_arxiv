    "at lattice97 we presented first results from the cp - pacs calculation of the quenched light hadron spectrum with the wilson quark action on large lattices ( @xmath0 fm ) at small quark masses ( @xmath1 0.75 down to 0.4 ) with high statistics ( 800 , 600 , 420 and 91 configurations at @xmath2 5.9 , 6.1 , 6.25 and 6.47 ) @xcite .",
    "we have since increased the statistics at @xmath3 to 150 , and have completed the analysis . in this article , we report the final spectrum results and the main points of analyses behind them .",
    "chiral extrapolation is a basic element of spectrum calculations , for which a choice has to be made of the functional form of hadron masses in terms of quark masses .",
    "an important issue in considering the choice is the validity of quenched chiral perturbation theory(q@xmath4pt ) @xcite , which predicts characteristic singularities in hadron masses in the chiral limit .",
    "we have therefore made a detailed examination of this issue .      for pseudo - scalar ( ps ) mesons made of quarks of mass @xmath5 and @xmath6 , q@xmath4pt formula reads@xcite @xmath7 \\",

    "\\label{eq : mps}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to test the presence of the logarithm term , we combine our results to form two quantities @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the degenerate ps meson with quark mass @xmath10 at @xmath1 0.6 , 0.5 , 0.4  ( 0.75 , 0.7 ) and @xmath11 is the non - degenerate one with @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the two quantities are related by @xmath12 , where the leading correction depends only on the @xmath13 term in ( [ eq : mps ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : psmassratio ] we plot the two quantities calculated with quark masses determined from an extended axial current ward identity ( @xmath14 ) as they have no ambiguity associated with the determination of the critical hopping parameter .",
    "the data fall within a narrow wedge spanned by the lines @xmath15",
    " @xmath16 , implying the value @xmath17 .",
    "we note that the @xmath18 term can not be ignored for the range of our quark masses ; results for the original ratio @xmath19@xcite , which receive corrections both from @xmath18 and @xmath13 terms , do not fall on a common line .",
    "= 7.0 cm    a different test using a ratio of decay constants @xmath20@xcite leads to a similar result ; our data fall within the lines @xmath21 with @xmath22  0.16 .    finally , making full correlated fits to @xmath23 using ( [ eq : mps ] ) but imposing @xmath24 , independently for degenerate and non - degenerate data , we find @xmath25  0.12 for the range @xmath26  1.4 gev .",
    "these results lead us to conclude that our ps data show evidence for q@xmath4pt logarithms .      for vector mesons and baryons ,",
    "we perform uncorrelated simultaneous fits to degenerate and non - degenerate data together as a function of @xmath23 , assuming q@xmath4pt mass formulae@xcite with @xmath27 . for vector mesons and decuplet baryons , all @xmath28 terms of q@xmath4pt",
    "are included as well as @xmath29 terms . for octet baryons ,",
    "we include @xmath30 terms in addition to @xmath28 and @xmath29 terms since the nucleon mass shows a negative curvature which is opposite to that of the @xmath28 term .",
    "we omit decuplet - octet coupling ( @xmath31 in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite ) and coupling to @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , and set @xmath34 .",
    "these mass formulae fit our data well .",
    "the values for the coefficient @xmath35 of @xmath28 terms , however , are small .",
    "we obtain @xmath35 = @xmath36 for @xmath37 , @xmath38 for nucleon , and @xmath39 for @xmath40 , to be compared with phenomenological estimates : @xmath41 for @xmath37 if @xmath27 and @xmath42 , and @xmath43 for nucleon if @xmath27 and @xmath44 .",
    "we conclude that vector and baryon masses are compatible with the presence of @xmath28 terms , but that their magnitudes are smaller than expected .",
    "these terms yield an effect of at most @xmath45 25 mev , which is about 3% of light hadron masses .",
    "= 7.5 cm    the results of analyses above motivate us to adopt the q@xmath4pt fits to calculate masses at each value of @xmath46 . the physical point for degenerate @xmath47 and @xmath48 quarks and the lattice scale",
    "are determined from the experimental values of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and the strange quark mass by that of @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "we then extrapolate the results linearly in @xmath53 . the final result for the spectrum in the continuum limit",
    "is shown in fig.[fig : spectrum ] .    in order to examine",
    "how results differ if we do not employ q@xmath4pt mass formulae , we repeat the analysis employing a quadratic polynomial in @xmath54 ( cubic for @xmath55 ) for chiral extrapolations .",
    "while masses at each value of @xmath46 differ , by about 3% in the largest case , the differences in the continuum limit do not exceed 1.5% of the results of q@xmath4pt fits .",
    "compared to the results presented at lattice97@xcite where we employed a linear chiral extrapolation in @xmath54 ( cubic for @xmath55 and quadratic for @xmath56 ) , the nucleon and @xmath40 masses have decreased by 4.5% and 3.5% , respectively .",
    "strange baryon masses with @xmath51 used as input have also decreased .",
    "the shift , however , is within @xmath57 for all particles , with either @xmath51 or @xmath52 as input .    in summary , we find that differences in chiral extrapolations and an increase of statistics at @xmath3 do not alter the conclusions we drew at the time of lattice97 : with @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 used as input , the meson hyperfine splitting and decuplet baryon mass splitting are too small compared to experiment , and so are the octet baryon masses .",
    "when we use @xmath52 instead of @xmath51 as input , the discrepancies for baryon masses are reduced , but the meson hyperfine splitting remains smaller .",
    "= 7.0 cm    the q@xmath4pt fit to pseudo - scalar meson masses has a significant effect on light quark masses at finite @xmath46 .",
    "due to a negative curvature of the q@xmath4pt formula , values of the averaged @xmath47 and @xmath48 quark mass defined with vector ward identity @xmath58 become smaller than those from polynomial chiral extrapolations as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : quarkmass ] . the results extrapolated to the continuum limit ,",
    "however , are consistent among various definitions .",
    "we adopt a combined fit to @xmath59 and @xmath14 , both estimated with q@xmath4pt fits , to calculate our final result .",
    "we obtain @xmath60=4.6(2 ) mev , and @xmath6=115(2 ) mev ( @xmath51 input ) or 143(6 ) mev ( @xmath52 input ) in the @xmath61 scheme at @xmath62 2  gev .",
    "we determine @xmath63 and @xmath64 from the local axial current , employing a quadratic polynomial and linear chiral extrapolation , respectively .",
    "we obtain @xmath65 120(6 ) mev and @xmath66 139(4 ) mev , which are 10 and 15% smaller than experiment , respectively .",
    "the ratio @xmath67 0.156(29 ) is also smaller than experiment .",
    "we have presented our final results on the quenched light hadron spectrum and related quantities . in the course of analyses we found that our data for light hadron masses are consistent with predictions of q@xmath4pt .",
    "the effect of q@xmath4pt singularities is small , however , and the continuum results do not noticeably shift from those obtained with polynomial chiral extrapolations .",
    "our results show that the quenched light hadron spectrum clearly and systematically deviates from the experimental spectrum .",
