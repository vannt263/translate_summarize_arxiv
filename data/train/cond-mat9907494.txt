    "recent experiments by mohanty , jariwala and webb @xcite strongly indicate an intrinsic nature of a low temperature saturation of the electron decoherence time @xmath0 in disordered conductors @xcite . it was argued in refs . that zero point fluctuations of electrons could be responsible for a finite dephasing at low temperatures .",
    "these as well as various other recent experimental results attract a lot of attention to the fundamental role of interactions in disordered mesoscopic systems .",
    "a theory of the above phenomenon @xcite was proposed in our papers @xcite .",
    "we demonstrated that electron - electron interactions in disordered systems can indeed be responsible for a nonzero electron decoherence rate down to @xmath5 .",
    "our results @xcite are in a good agreement with experimental findings @xcite .",
    "we also argued @xcite that this interaction - induced decoherence has the same physical nature as in the case of a quantum particle interacting with a bath of harmonic oscillators @xcite .",
    "the low temperature saturation of the decoherence rate @xmath6 on a level predicted in refs .",
    "has serious theoretical consequences .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that these predictions initiated intensive theoretical debates @xcite .",
    "in contrast to refs . , various authors @xcite argued that interaction - induced electron dephasing at @xmath7 is not possible .",
    "vavilov and ambegaokar ( va ) @xcite argued the quantum correction to the classical result @xcite should be small at least in the limit @xmath8 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the above discussion goes far beyond the problem of electron dephasing only .",
    "this discussion is important for a general understanding of the role of the electron - electron interactions in mesoscopic systems at low temperatures . according e.g. to aleiner , altshuler and gershenzon ( aag ) @xcite this role is merely to provide a ( temperature dependent ) renormalization of a disordered potential of impurities . within this picture , at sufficiently low @xmath4 ( when the effect of thermal fluctuations is small and can be neglected ) electrons propagate in an effective inhomogeneous _",
    "static _ potential which should be determined self - consistently in the presence of coulomb interaction .",
    "if so , electron scattering on such a static potential is not any different from that on static impurities and , hence , can not lead to dephasing .",
    "our results @xcite suggest a different picture , according to which _ dynamical _ effects are important at all temperatures down to @xmath5 and the high frequency `` quantum '' modes with @xmath9 _ do _ contribute to dephasing .",
    "two main arguments supporting the first ( `` static '' ) picture are usually discussed @xcite .",
    "the first argument is quite general and is not necessarily related to electrons in a disordered metal .",
    "one can argue @xcite that a particle with energy @xmath10 can not excite harmonic oscillators with frequencies @xmath9 and , hence the latter will at most lead to renormalization effects .",
    "it is easy to observe , however , that this argument explicitly contradicts to the exact results obtained e.g. within the caldeira - leggett model @xcite .",
    "there even at @xmath5 the off - diagonal elements of the particle density matrix decay at a finite length set by interaction .",
    "this effect is due to _ all _ high frequency modes of the effective environment , i.e. the picture is by no means `` static '' ( see also refs . for further discussion ) .",
    "one can also modify the above argument and conjecture @xcite that the system of electrons can behave differently from a bosonic one @xcite because of the pauli principle which restricts scattering space for electrons at low @xmath4 and , hence , their ability to exchange energy .",
    "again , this argument contradicts to the well known results obtained for _ fermionic _ systems .",
    "e.g. it is well established @xcite that tunneling electrons exchange energy with the effective environment ( formed by other electrons in the leads ) even at @xmath5 .",
    "this exchange results in the temperature independent broadening of the effective energy distribution @xmath11 for tunneling electrons @xcite .",
    "this so - called `` p(e)-theory '' was verified in many experiments @xcite . a close formal and physical similarity between the theory @xcite and our analysis @xcite",
    "is discussed in ref . .",
    "the second argument against the possibility of the interaction - induced saturation of @xmath0 is purely formal .",
    "it is based on a perturbative calculation by aag @xcite .",
    "these authors claimed @xcite that the results of this calculation explicitly contradict to our results @xcite and , hence , the latter are incorrect .",
    "however , a convincing comparison between the two calculations was not presented .",
    "furthermore , it our reply @xcite we pointed out that the origin of the above controversy lies deeper , and the aag s suggestion that our calculation is `` profoundly incorrect '' can not be taken seriously .",
    "we argued that both approaches _ do agree _ on a perturbative level and the key difference between them is that our calculation @xcite is nonperturbative while the analysis by aag does not go beyond the first order in the interaction and , on top of that , involves additional approximations not contained in our paper @xcite .",
    "for instance , for the exactly solvable caldeira - leggett model we demonstrated @xcite that within the perturbative approach involving analogous approximations one arrives at incorrect results and misses the effect of quantum decoherence at low temperatures .    motivated by this discussion as well as by the fundamental importance of the problem",
    "we have undertaken an additional analysis of the effect of interaction - induced decoherence in disordered metals .",
    "this analysis will help us to demonstrate the actual relation between our approach @xcite and that of aag @xcite .",
    "since it is hardly possible to settle a calculational dispute without presenting sufficiently many details , in this paper we made an effort to provide the reader with such details of our calculation .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we will demonstrate a principal insufficiency of the perturbation theory in the interaction for the problem of quantum dephasing .",
    "we will argue that @xmath0 can not be unambiguously extracted even from a correct perturbative calculation . in section 3",
    "we extend our nonperturbative calculation @xcite",
    ". we will carry out a complete analysis of the problem with the exponential accuracy .",
    "we will also present semi - quantitative arguments which , however , will be sufficient in order to understand the effect of interaction on the pre - exponent . in section 4",
    "we perform a detailed perturbative calculation and demonstrate that at low @xmath4 some previous perturbative results are based on several insufficient approximations , the main of which is the golden rule approximation .",
    "we also establish an explicit relation between nonperturbative @xcite and perturbative @xcite calculations . a close formal similarity between the problem in question and the exactly solvable caldeira - leggett model",
    "is analyzed in section 5 . in section 6",
    "we briefly summarize our main observations . for the sake of convenience",
    "we will briefly announce the main steps of our calculation in the beginning of each section .",
    "some further technical details are presented in appendices a , b , c and d. in appendix e we discuss the results @xcite .",
    "in this section we will demonstrate a principal insufficiency of a perturbative ( in the interaction ) approach to the problem of quantum dephasing . in the subsection",
    "a we will present some general remarks concerning the role of the perturbation theory for the problem of a quantum mechanical particle interacting with other quantum degrees of freedom . in the subsection b we discuss the relation between perturbative and nonperturbative calculations of the magnetoconductance and the decoherence time @xmath0 in disordered conductors .",
    "the time evolution of the density matrix of such a particle is defined by the following equation : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the particle coordinate .",
    "the kernel @xmath14 depends on the feynman - vernon influence functional @xcite and contains the full information about the effect of interaction .",
    "this kernel can formally be expanded in powers of the interaction strength @xmath15 the `` noninteracting '' kernel @xmath16 does not change the state of the system ( provided its initial state is an eigenstate of the noninteracting hamiltonian ) and in this sense it is equivalent to the unity operator .",
    "all other terms of this expansion grow with time the faster the larger the number @xmath17 is . as a result in general",
    "all these terms ( [ jnt ] ) become important for sufficiently long times . hence , the perturbation theory in the interaction ( which amounts to keeping only several first terms of the expansion ( [ jnt ] ) ) is equivalent to the short time expansion of the exact density matrix .",
    "thus in general this perturbation theory can not correctly describe the long time behavior of the interacting system no matter how weak the interaction is .",
    "keeping only the term @xmath18 in ( [ jnt ] ) under some additional assumptions one can express the probability @xmath19 for the particle @xmath13 to remain in its initial state as @xmath20 where the kernel @xmath21 can be derived from the influence functional @xcite and will not be specified here",
    ". in equilibrium one usually has @xmath22 .",
    "( [ wii ] ) applies at short times , when the second term is still much smaller than unity .",
    "but even in this limit the correct information can be missed by insufficient approximations .",
    "for instance , the frequently used approximation amounts to retaining only the @xmath23 term in the kernel @xmath24 . within this so - called golden rule approximation one",
    "finds @xmath25 furthermore , assuming that the effect of higher order terms in the expansion ( [ jnt ] ) can be accounted for by exponentiating the last term in ( [ wii1 ] ) one immediately arrives at @xmath26 .",
    "obviously the above set of approximations is justified only in special cases .",
    "for instance , the golden rule approximation can work only provided the kernel @xmath27 decays rapidly as compared to other relevant time scales in the problem .",
    "this could be the case e.g. at sufficiently high temperatures .",
    "in general , and especially in the low temperature limit , the golden rule approximation ( [ wii1 ] ) fails . and",
    "it is particularly dangerous to combine the _ short _ time perturbative expansion with the _ long _ time golden rule approximation .",
    "e.g. if @xmath28 happens to be zero , it would follow from ( [ wii1 ] ) that the particle will stay in its initial state forever even in the presence of interaction .",
    "obviously this can not be the case .",
    "the exponential decay of the probability @xmath19 in time is also an artifact of the golden rule approximation . in general",
    "the time dynamics of an interacting system is much more complicated , and it should be determined from eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) .    in eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) is usually implied that the initial density matrix @xmath29 does not coincide with the exact reduced equilibrium density matrix for the _ interacting _ system .",
    "the standard approach is simply to factorize the initial density matrix @xcite , i.e. to represent it as a product of the particle density matrix @xmath30 and the equilibrium density matrix of all other degrees of freedom . in this case , even if initially both the particle and the environment were in their noninteracting ground states at @xmath5 , the relaxation process occurs because the factorized density matrix does not describe the ground state of the interacting system .",
    "one could question the relevance of such initial conditions e.g. to the problem of electron transport in disordered conductors in the presence of interaction .",
    "indeed , in this case the density matrix is never factorized and no time evolution can be expected for the equilibrium density matrix of the whole interacting system .",
    "hence , at @xmath5 in equilibrium no relaxation should occur .    in order to clarify the situation let recall the formal expression for the conductivity",
    "( see the eq .",
    "( [ sigma00 ] ) ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the equilibrium electron density matrix .",
    "we observe that the effective initial density matrix @xmath34 in this expression is strongly perturbed at all @xmath4 as compared to @xmath33 due to the factor @xmath35 .",
    "therefore relaxation always takes place in our problem . since for a dissipative",
    "system relaxation times do not depend on the initial conditions , one can safely assume the initial density matrix to be , for instance , factorized .",
    "actually the same assumption is used within the diagrammatic approach : a complete equivalence between eq .",
    "( [ sigma00 ] ) ( factorized density matrix ) and the diagrammatic expression for the conductance @xcite was demonstrated in appendix a in the first order in the interaction .",
    "the weak localization correction to the conductivity of a disordered metal can be expressed in the following form @xmath36 @xmath37 is the elastic electron mean free time .",
    "the function @xmath2 increases with time and describes the cooperon decay due to interaction ( @xmath2 equals to zero without interaction ) .",
    "the presence of the magnetic field @xmath38 causes an additional decay on a time scale @xmath39 . by varying the magnetic field and thus @xmath40 ( which decreases with increasing @xmath38 )",
    "one can extract information about the interaction - induced decoherence directly from the magnetoconductance measurements .",
    "the pre - exponential function @xmath3 without interaction is @xmath41 . in the presence of interaction the function @xmath3 will , of course , depend on the interaction as well . as it is demonstrated below ,",
    "this dependence is can be ignored while calculating the decoherence time @xmath0 which should only be extracted from the function @xmath2 in the exponent of ( [ dsigwl ] ) .",
    "this is the procedure of ref . .",
    "however , the dependence of the pre - exponent @xmath3 on the interaction _ is _ important if one wants to recover the subleading in @xmath42 term in the expression for @xmath43 in the limit of a strong magnetic field @xmath44 . in this case only short times @xmath45 contribute to the integral ( [ dsigwl ] ) and it is sufficient to perform a short time expansion of both @xmath46 and @xmath3 .",
    "this expansion mixes terms important and unimportant for dephasing and in general makes it _ impossible _ to extract correct information about the dephasing time @xmath0 from the perturbation theory even in the limit of strong magnetic fields @xmath44 .    in order to illustrate this conclusion",
    "let us restrict ourselves to a quasi-1d case .",
    "the expression ( [ dsigwl ] ) may then be rewritten as follows @xmath47 where the function @xmath48 accounts for the interaction .",
    "note , that the function @xmath49 can ( and in general does ) depend not only on one but on several parameters @xmath50 . in this section",
    "we will assume that @xmath49 depends on only one parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this is sufficient for our purposes .    in the absence of interaction @xmath51 and the divergence in the integral ( [ 1 ] )",
    "is cut at times @xmath52 . in this case from ( [ 1 ] ) we reproduce the well known result @xmath53 for large @xmath40 ( i.e. for @xmath54 ) the result ( [ h ] ) diverges and the effect of interaction should be taken into account . provided in the long time limit the function @xmath49 decays faster than @xmath55 the integral ( [ 1 ] ) converges even for @xmath56 and we get @xmath57 where the prefactor @xmath58 which depends on the function @xmath49 .",
    "the precise definition of @xmath59 is of little practical interest since this prefactor can always be removed by rescaling of @xmath0 . of importance",
    ", however , is to describe the behavior of the function @xmath48 at @xmath60 .",
    "this allows to determine the magnitude of the dephasing time @xmath0 .",
    "clearly , a nonperturbative analysis in the interaction is needed in order to determine the function @xmath49 at times @xmath60 simply because there exists no small parameter in the problem .",
    "e.g. if one would formally decrease the interaction strength , the magnitude of the dephasing time @xmath0 would increase , but one would never avoid the necessity to determine the function @xmath49 at @xmath60 .",
    "thus the problem of finding the decoherence time in disordered conductors is _ nonperturbative for any interaction strength_. in this respect the statement of ref . that `` since @xmath0 is much longer than the elastic scattering time , the dephasing is weak and",
    "there is no need to invoke nonperturbative ideas '' remains puzzling to us .",
    "indeed , at times of order @xmath0 the dephasing is strong by definition , and it is not clear how the condition @xmath61 might help to avoid `` nonperturbative ideas '' .    observing this problem aag @xcite suggested to consider the limit of strong magnetic fields @xmath44 , for which the integral ( [ 1 ] ) converges already at times @xmath52 much shorter than @xmath0 . in this case",
    "the weak localization correction can be calculated perturbatively in the interaction or , equivalently , by means a short time expansion of the function @xmath49 .",
    "the recipe to evaluate the dephasing time from the perturbation theory suggested by aag can be summarized as follows .    in the zero order in the interaction we have @xmath62 and the magnitude of the weak localization correction ( [ h ] ) increases as @xmath63 with increasing @xmath40 .",
    "if , expanding in the interaction , one would recover the term @xmath64 , this term could just be added to ( [ h ] ) and interpreted as an interaction - induced renormalization effect of the bare parameters .",
    "the presence of such a term would imply that @xmath49 is not anymore equal to one but acquires some interaction correction .",
    "nevertheless no time dependence of @xmath49 and , hence , no dephasing occurs in this case and therefore the terms @xmath64 are not `` dangerous '' . if , however , the first order conductance correction is found to increase with @xmath40 _ faster _ than @xmath63 and to have an opposite with respect to @xmath65 ( [ h ] ) ( i.e. positive ) sign , this would already mean that the function @xmath49 depends on time ( decays with increasing @xmath66 ) due to interaction and , hence , nonzero dephasing occurs . then",
    ", if such `` dephasing '' terms are recovered within this perturbative procedure , one should look at a temperature dependence of such terms .",
    "if these terms are present at a finite @xmath4 , but decrease and vanish as temperature approaches zero this would imply that interaction does not cause any dephasing at @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath4-independent positive terms growing faster than @xmath63 are recovered one would be able to conclude that nonzero dephasing occurs at @xmath5 already within the first order perturbation theory in the interaction .",
    "we are going to demonstrate that the above perturbative strategy _ in principle _ can not be used to correctly obtain the dephasing time @xmath0 for any magnetic field even though the correction @xmath67 _ can _ be evaluated perturbatively in the limit @xmath44 .    to begin with , we note that already the terms @xmath64 can easily cause troubles provided they give a ( positive ) contribution to @xmath68 large as compared to the magnitude of the zero order term ( [ h ] ) .",
    "in fact , the presence of terms @xmath64 just implies that their time dependence saturates already at short times @xmath45 .",
    "if this saturated value turns out to exceed the zero order term , this would only indicate the breakdown of the perturbation expansion in the interaction and , hence , no definite conclusion from this expansion can be drawn .",
    "an even much more important problem is that the form of the function @xmath69 in ( [ 1 ] ) can not be recovered from the perturbation theory at all .",
    "it is quite obvious that the first order perturbative terms will depend only on the derivative @xmath70 .",
    "although in the limit @xmath44 the value @xmath68 can be calculated perturbatively in the interaction , this would yield no information about the dephasing time @xmath0 .",
    "such information can be extracted only if one _ assumes _ some particular form of the function @xmath48 .",
    "but this form should be _ found _ rather than assumed .",
    "this task can be accomplished only if one goes beyond the perturbation theory .",
    "let us consider several different functions @xmath48 .",
    "perhaps the most frequent choice of this function is based on the assumption about purely exponential decay of the phase correlations , in which case one has @xmath71 as it was already discussed above , this form of the function @xmath49 follows directly from the golden rule approximation . substituting ( [ 1a ] ) into ( [ 1 ] ) in the limit of weak magnetic fields",
    "@xmath72 one immediately arrives at the result for the weak localization correction of the form ( [ h ] ) with @xmath40 substituted by @xmath73 . in the limit of weak magnetic fields @xmath72 the result ( [ 2 ] ) with @xmath74 is recovered . in the opposite limit @xmath44 eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 1a ] ) yield @xmath75 where @xmath65 is defined in ( [ h ] ) .",
    "another possible choice of the function @xmath49 can be @xmath76 the reason for such a choice will become clear later .",
    "the substitution of ( [ 1b ] ) into ( [ 1 ] ) again yields the result ( [ 2 ] ) ( with @xmath77 , @xmath78 is the euler gamma - function ) in the limit @xmath72 , while in the opposite limit @xmath44 from ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 1b ] ) one obtains @xmath79 comparing ( [ 2a ] ) and ( [ 2b ] ) we observe that for strong magnetic fields the interaction corrections to the leading order term ( [ h ] ) are different depending on the choice of the function @xmath49 , even though for weak magnetic fields both choices ( [ 1a ] ) and ( [ 1b ] ) yield the same result ( [ 2 ] ) with only slightly different values of a numerical prefactor @xmath59 .",
    "the magnetoresistance data are frequently fitted to the formula @xcite @xmath80 where ai@xmath81 is the airy function . in the limit @xmath82 this equation again reduces to ( [ 2 ] ) with the factor @xmath83 . in the opposite limit @xmath44",
    "one finds @xmath84 we observe the equivalence between ( [ 2b ] ) and ( [ airy1 ] ) up to a numerical prefactor of order one .",
    "finally , let choose the trial function @xmath49 in the following form : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a numerical coefficient of order one . combining ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 1c ] ) we find @xmath87 in the limit",
    "@xmath44 one can expand this equation in powers of @xmath42 and get @xmath88 while in the limit @xmath72 from ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 1c ] ) one again recovers eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) with a slightly modified numerical prefactor @xmath59 ( which now also depends on the value @xmath86 ) . absorbing @xmath59 by a proper redefinition of @xmath0",
    "one can plot the result ( [ 1 ] ) for the trial functions ( [ 1a ] ) , ( [ 1c ] ) ( for different values of @xmath86 ) and eq .",
    "( [ airy ] ) depending on the magnetic field ( or @xmath40 ) .",
    "these plots are presented in fig .",
    "we observe that all four plotted functions are very close to each other ( e.g. the maximum deviation between ( [ airy ] ) and @xmath68 obtained from ( [ 1c ] ) with @xmath89 does not exceed 0.01 ) .",
    "if one would fit the experimental data for the magnetoconductance with any of these four functions one ( i ) would not be able to distinguish between them within typical error bars and ( ii ) would obtain _ the same _ value @xmath0 for all these functions ( up to a prefactor @xmath58 absorbed in @xmath0 anyway ) .",
    "in other words , the results for @xmath0 extracted from fitting the experimental data to several different functions @xmath48 will be practically insensitive to the particular form of @xmath49 as long as its decay at long times is sufficiently fast to provide an effective cutoff for the integral ( [ 1 ] ) at @xmath60 .    at the same time",
    "if one tries to extract @xmath0 from the perturbation theory in the interaction one immediately arrives at ambiguous and contradictory results .",
    "let us , for example , consider the perturbative result of aag @xmath90 ( see e.g. eq . ( 4.8b ) of ref . ) and , following the above paper , assume an exponential decay of correlations ( [ 1a ] ) . in this case the dephasing time @xmath0 is obtained from a direct comparison of eq .",
    "( [ 2a ] ) ( equivalent to eq .",

    "( 3 ) of ref . ) with eq .",
    "( [ 3a ] ) ( or eq .",
    "( 4.8b ) in ref . ) .",
    "one obtains @xmath91 ( cf .",
    "( 4.9b ) of ref . ) .",
    "the result ( [ 3b ] ) is essentially based on the _ assumption _ about a purely exponential decay ( [ 1a ] ) .",
    "note , however , that _ a - priori _ there is no reason to assume such a decay .",
    "[ just on the contrary , it will be demonstrated below that this is _ not _ the case for the problem in question . ]",
    "the cutoff functions ( [ 1b ] ) , ( [ 1c ] ) ( and many others ) yield the same result ( [ 2 ] ) as the function ( [ 1a ] ) and one can hardly make a distinction between them from the magnetoconductance measurements ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    for instance , if one sticks to the choice ( [ 1b ] ) , one should extract @xmath0 by comparing eqs .",
    "( [ 2b ] ) and ( [ 3a ] )",
    ". this comparison yields @xmath0 independent of @xmath40 and @xmath92 .",
    "the latter form coincides with the well known result by altshuler , aronov and khmelnitskii ( aak ) @xcite but is in an obvious disagreement with ( [ 3b ] ) .",
    "if , instead of ( [ 1b ] ) , one uses the trial function ( [ 1c ] ) and compares ( [ 2c ] ) and ( [ 3b ] ) , one finds @xmath93 , i.e. positive , zero and even negative ( ! ) dephasing times respectively for @xmath94 , @xmath89 and @xmath95",
    ". however , all these dramatic differences in the first order results have no effect both on the form of the magnetoconductance @xmath43 ( fig . 1 ) and on the value @xmath0 extracted from it .",
    "thus , whatever result is obtained in the first order perturbation theory in the interaction , it is yet insufficient to draw any definite conclusion about the dephasing time @xmath0 .",
    "the problem is essentially nonperturbative and should be treated as such .",
    "the corresponding analysis was developed in our paper @xcite and will be extended further in the next section .",
    "in order to provide a complete description of the electron - electron interaction effect on the weak localization correction ( [ dsigwl ] ) it is in general necessary to calculate both the function @xmath2 in the exponent of ( [ dsigwl ] ) and the pre - exponential function @xmath3 .",
    "an important observation is , however , that information about the effect of interaction on @xmath3 is not needed to correctly evaluate the dephasing time @xmath0 .",
    "it suffices to find only the function @xmath2 which describes the decay of correlations in time and provides an effective cutoff for the integral ( [ dsigwl ] ) at @xmath60 .",
    "the role of the pre - exponent is merely to establish an exact numerical prefactor .",
    "since @xmath0 is defined up to a numerical prefactor of order one anyway , it is clear that only the function @xmath2  and not @xmath3  is really important .    in the subsection",

    "this procedure is important in at least two aspects : ( i ) it allows to unambiguously settle the issue of unphysical divergences which was argued by va @xcite to be a problem in our previous calculation @xcite and ( ii ) it is necessary to establish a direct relation between our nonperturbative approach and the perturbation theory in the interaction . in the subsection b we will perform a semi - quantitative analysis of the effect of interactions on the pre - exponential function @xmath3 . in the subsection c",
    "we will demonstrate that the short time perturbative expansion of both the exponent and the pre - exponent at low @xmath4 not only can ( section 2b ) but _ does _ lead to missing an important information about @xmath0 in disordered conductors .",
    "the function @xmath2 can be evaluated by means of the path integral formalism @xcite .",
    "this procedure amounts to calculating the path integral for the kernel of the evolution operator @xmath96 within the saddle point approximation on pairs of time reversed paths and to averaging over diffusive trajectories . here",
    "@xmath97 and @xmath98 represent the electron action on the two parts of the keldysh contour , while @xmath99 accounts for the interaction . the effective action ( [ 10 ] )",
    "was derived in our ref .",
    ", for the sake of convenience we reproduce the explicit expressions in appendix a ( eqs .",
    "( [ j17]-[si ] ) ) together with the expression for the conductance of a disordered metal in terms of the kernel of the evolution operator @xmath14 and the electron density matrix ( [ sigma00 ] ) .",
    "the saddle point approximation procedure was described in details in ref . .",
    "one can demonstrate that the contribution of the real part @xmath100 of the action ( [ sr ] ) vanishes on any pair of time reversed diffusive paths . by no means",
    "this cancellation occurs by chance , rather it is a generic property of a wide class of influence functionals describing dissipative environments .",
    "e.g. similar cancellation is observed in the caldeira - leggett model @xcite , the relation to which will be discussed in section 5 .",
    "also we would like to point out that for any pair of paths @xmath100 contributes only to the _ real _ part of the effective action and , hence , can never cancel an _ imaginary _ contribution from the term @xmath101 ( [ si ] ) .",
    "anyway , the function @xmath2 in the exponent is determined solely by the imaginary part of the action @xmath101 ( [ si ] ) and it is given by the following expression @xcite : @xmath102 where the function @xmath103 is defined in ( [ i55 ] ) . in equilibrium it is expressed in terms of an imaginary part of the inverse effective dielectric susceptibility @xmath104 multiplied by @xmath105 . the first term ( [ ft ] )",

    "the only justification of the above statements which we could extract from the above papers is that our result for the dephasing rate @xmath6 `` is proportional to the first power of the fluctuation propagator '' @xcite .",

    "a close similarity between both problems is obvious from our analysis presented in sec .",

    "no momentum conservation was imposed in our analysis , rather the electron energy conservation on these trajectories was used .",
    "this approximation is fully justified , since the saddle point paths are determined by the `` noninteracting '' terms in the effective action while `` interacting '' terms are treated as a perturbation in the exponent . for these saddle point paths the factor @xmath694 ( and not @xmath695 ) does not depend on time .",
    "it is not quite clear why va suggest to consider odd functions of time @xmath696 .",

    "the contribution of the trajectories with nonzero @xmath100 to the path integral may only be suppressed further due to the presence of the oscillating term @xmath698 .    trying to justify their arguments va presented several equations ( eqs .",

    "we also failed to find a proof of even stronger va s statement that one can `` observe the same type of cancellation of high frequency contributions to the conductivity in any order of perturbation theory '' .",
    "having observed that none of our results @xcite suffers from the va s `` critique '' let us come to the analysis of the calculation @xcite . in order to understand the problems with this calculation we have to start from another paper of the same authors @xcite .",
    "va acknowledged that the paper @xcite `` is simply wrong , because it treats the phase as a single particle and looses the physics associated with the exclusion principle '' .",
    "we can not agree with the second part of this statement . in our opinion",
    ", it was a good idea of ref .",
    "to apply the caldeira - leggett model in order to qualitatively understand the experimental results @xcite .",
    "it is not the absence of the exclusion principle in this model , it is the calculation of ref . which is problematic . in particular , we mention that according to ref . the real part of the action @xmath100 is responsible for the low temperature saturation of @xmath0 whereas the contribution of its imaginary part @xmath101 is not important at @xmath7 .",
    "a correct calculation demonstrates the opposite : both in the cl model and in the case of a disordered metal the term @xmath101 is important , while the term @xmath100 does not contribute to the exponent ( and thus to the dephasing time ) at all .",

    "should the term @xmath100 be kept in the exponent , the result @xcite would follow again . in order to avoid that va expanded the exponent to the first order in @xmath100 and in the `` quantum '' part of @xmath101 and made use of the perturbation theory developed in ref . .",
    "several comments are in order .    1 .   even if the perturbative calculations @xcite of the weak localization correction in the high temperature limit were correct , the correct dephasing time @xmath0 could not be extracted from these calculations .",
    "the reason for that is exactly the same as for the perturbative calculation @xcite : the @xmath4-independent linear in time perturbative contributions coming from the taylor expansion of the exponent and the pre - exponent exactly cancel each other in the first order . as it was explained in sec .",
    "2 the problem of finding the dephasing time @xmath0 is essentially nonperturbative and , hence , the method @xcite should fail already at the point where the exponent was ( partially ) expanded in powers of the interaction .",
    "the perturbative analysis @xcite can not simply be repeated for the situation considered by va because the initial ( non - perturbed ) propagators depend on the classical part of the fluctuating field .",
    "this implies that the fourier transformation in time can not easily be performed , and the whole calculation should be redone from the very beginning .",
    "3 .   in order to obtain the `` classical '' part of the weak localization correction va used a minimization procedure , the meaning of which remains unclear .",

    "this should imply that the rate @xmath702 in ref .",

    "unfortunately va did not clarify ( i ) why the result ( [ blsh1 ] ) should be minimized with respect to @xmath702 and ( ii ) why the rate @xmath702 depends now on the electron - electron interaction though initially it was assumed that @xmath702 is _ not _ related to the electron - electron interaction at all .",

    "below we will demonstrate that no conclusion about both the sign and the value of the quantum correction to the classical dephasing rate can be drawn from the expression for the leading order high temperature correction @xmath708 .",
    "va s procedure can easily be tested with the aid of the results derived in the present paper .",
