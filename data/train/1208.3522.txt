    "scaling relations of early - type galaxies ( etgs , ellipticals e and lenticulars s0 ) have played a central role in our understanding of galaxy evolution , since the discovery that the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath21 @xcite and the galaxy projected half - light radius @xmath22 @xcite correlate with galaxy luminosity @xmath23 .",
    "an important step forward was made with the discovery that these two relations are just projections of a relatively narrow plane , the fundamental plane ( fp ) @xcite , relating the three variables @xmath24 . when the plane is used as a distance indicator , as was especially the case at the time of its discovery",
    ", the luminosity can be replaced by the surface brightness within  as @xmath25 and the observed plane assumes the form @xmath26 where the adopted parameters are the median of the 11 independent determinations tabulated in @xcite .",
    "it was immediately realized that the existence of the fp could be due to the galaxies being in virial equilibrium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and that the deviation ( tilt ) of the coefficients from the virial predictions @xmath27 , could be explained by a smooth power - law variation of mass - to - light ratio @xmath15 with mass @xcite .",
    "the fp showed that galaxies assemble via regular processes and that their properties are closely related to their mass .",
    "the tightness of the plane gives constraints on the variation of stellar population among galaxies of similar characteristics and on their dark matter content @xcite .",
    "the regularity also allows one to use the fp to study galaxy evolution , by tracing its variations with redshift @xcite .",
    "however , other reasons for the deviation of the coefficients are possible : the constant coefficients in the simple virial relation only rigorously apply if galaxies are spherical and homologous systems , with similar profiles and dark matter fraction . but both galaxies concentration @xcite and the amount of random motions in their stars @xcite were found to systematically increase with galaxy luminosity .",
    "the uncertain origin of the tilt led to a large number of investigations about its origin , exploring the effects of ( i ) the systematic variation in the stellar population or imf ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or ( ii ) the non - homology in the surface brightness distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or ( iii ) the kinematic ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or ( iv ) the variation in the amount of dark matter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , on the fp tilt and scatter .",
    "those works were all based on approximate galaxy spherical models , trying to test general hypotheses and not reproducing real galaxies in detail , which sometimes led to contrasting results .",
    "what became clear however was that various effects could potentially influence a major part of the fp tilt .",
    "moreover it was found that the small scatter in the fp implies a well regulated formation for etgs .",
    "the next step forward came with subsequent studies , which instead of testing general trends , used small samples of objects and tried to push to the limit the accuracy of measuring galaxy central masses , while reducing biases as much as possible .",
    "those accurate total masses could be directly compared to the simple virial ones , testing for residual trends .",
    "similar but independent studies were performed using two completely different techniques , either stellar dynamics @xcite or strong gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "the results from those efforts agree with each others , and showed that the tilt of the fp is almost entirely due to a genuine @xmath15 variation .    in this paper",
    "we investigate once more the origin of the fp tilt .",
    "this new study is motivated by the dramatic increase in the size and quality of our galaxy sample , with respect to any previous similar study .",
    "we have in fact state - of - the - art ` sauron `  @xcite stellar kinematics for all the 260 early - type galaxies of the atlas@xmath2  sample ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) , which constitute a volume - limited and carefully selected sample of etgs , down to a stellar mass of about @xmath0 m@xmath1 .",
    "this fact , combined with detailed dynamical models for the entire sample , allows us to test previous claims with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "the new models also include a dark matter halo and give constraints on the dark matter content in the centres of early - type galaxies .",
    "these measurements will be used in the companion ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  xx ) to provide a novel view of galaxy scaling relations .    in",
    "what follows , in section  2 we present the sample and data , in section  3 we describe the methods used to extract our quantities , in section  4 we present our results on the fp tilt , dark matter and the @xmath28 relation , and finally we summarize our paper in section  5 .",
    "the galaxies studied in this work are the 260 early - type galaxies which constitute the volume - limited and nearly mass - selected atlas@xmath2  sample ( paper  i ) .",
    "the object were morphologically selected as early - type according to the classic criterion @xcite of not showing spiral arms or a disk - scale dust lane ( when seen edge - on ) .",
    "the early - types are extracted from a parent sample of 871 galaxies of all morphological types brighter than @xmath29 mag , using 2mass photometry @xcite , inside a local ( @xmath30 mpc ) volume of @xmath31 mpc@xmath32 ( see full details in paper  i ) .",
    "our goal is to measure total masses , or equivalently mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath15 ) , in the central regions of galaxies .",
    "@xmath15 of significant samples of individual etgs have been previously obtained via dynamical modelling ( e.g.  @xcite [ 37 etgs ] ; @xcite [ 36 etgs ] ; @xcite [ 21 etgs ] ; @xcite [ 25 etgs ] ; @xcite [ 16 etgs ] ; @xcite [ 14 etgs ] ; @xcite [ 48 etgs ] ) or strong gravitational lensing ( e.g.  @xcite [ 22 etgs ] ; @xcite [ 15 etgs ] ; @xcite [ 53 etgs ] ; @xcite [ 73 etgs ] ) .",
    "an important , and perhaps not obvious , difference between the quantities obtained with the two techniques is that the dynamical models provide masses enclosed within a _ spherical _ radius , while strong lensing measures the mass inside a _ cylinder _ with axis parallel to the line - of - sight .",
    "care has to be taken when comparing the two methods .",
    "an illustration of this fact is given in figure  1 of @xcite .",
    "an advantage of the strong lensing technique is that the recovered mass inside a cylinder with the radius of the einstein ring is nearly insensitive to the mass distribution , and completely independent on the stellar dynamics .",
    "however , the requirement of a galaxy to act as a strong lens , necessarily imposes biases in the objects selection , and in particular limits mass measurements via strong lensing to the most massive nearby etgs ( @xmath33 km s@xmath34 in @xcite ) .",
    "the dynamical modelling technique has the significant advantage that it can in principle be applied to any bound system made of stars .",
    "however , it requires a detailed treatment of the observed surface brightness and orbital distribution , in combination with integral - field data , for robust and accurate values ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we apply the stellar dynamical modelling technique to the atlas@xmath2  sample of 260 early - type galaxies .",
    "this increases the sample size for which accurate total masses have been measured by a factor of four .",
    "moreover the sample is volume - limited and statistically representative of the nearby galaxy population with stellar mass @xmath0 @xmath35 and in particular includes etgs with velocity dispersion as low as @xmath36 km s@xmath34 ( see paper  i for an illustration of the characteristics of the sample ) .      various multi - wavelengths datasets are available for the sample galaxies ( see a summary in paper  i ) . in this work",
    "we make use of the ` sauron `  @xcite integral - field stellar kinematics within about one half - light radius , which was introduced in @xcite , for the subset of 48 early - types in the ` sauron `  survey @xcite , and in paper  i for the rest of the atlas@xmath2  sample .",
    "maps of the stellar velocity for all the 260 galaxies were presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  ii ) .    in this paper",
    "we are not interested in the shape of the stellar line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) , but we want to approximate velocity moments which are predicted by the @xcite equations . in @xcite",
    "we used semi - analytic models to compute a set of realistic galaxy losvds with known velocity moments , using the @xcite formalism , as implemented in @xcite .",
    "the models losvds were used to broaden galaxy spectral templates and noise was subsequently added .",
    "the kinematics was then extracted from the synthetic spectra using ppxf @xcite as done for the real galaxies .",
    "we found that @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath21 are the mean and standard deviation of the best fitting gaussian provide a better empirical approximation to the velocity second moment @xmath39 than an integral of a more general losvd described by the gauss - hermite parametrization @xcite .",
    "this is due to the large sensitivity of the moments to the wings of the losvd , which are observationally ill determined .",
    "for this reason all the kinematic quantities used in the paper are extracted using a simple gaussian losvd in the ppxf software ( keyword moments@xmath402 ) .",
    "the photometry used in this work comes from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) data release eight ( dr8 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for 225 galaxies and was supplemented by our own photometry taken at the 2.5-m isaac newton telescope in the same set of filters and with comparable signal to noise for the rest of the sample galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  xxi ) .",
    "various dynamical modelling techniques have been developed in the past .",
    "they are all characterized by their ability to reproduce in detail , in a _ non - parametric _ way , the characteristics of the galaxy surface brightness .",
    "this contrasts with a more qualitative toy - model approach ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that assume a spherical shape and a simpler parametrization ( e.  g. @xcite or @xcite profile ) for the surface brightness of all galaxies",
    ". an accurate description of the galaxy surface brightness is a necessary requirement for quantitative and unbiased measurements of dynamical quantities as much of the kinematic information on real galaxies is contained in the photometry alone @xcite .",
    "the state of the art in the field is currently represented by @xcite orbit - superposition approach , which was originally developed to reproduce galaxy stellar densities and was later generalized to produce detailed fits to the stellar kinematics @xcite and has been widely used for determinations of masses of supermassive black holes ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for galaxy mass determinations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and to recover orbital distributions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a close contender technique , but not as widely used , is the particle - based made - to - measure method of @xcite as implemented to reproduce kinematical observables by various groups @xcite .",
    "when the gravitational potential is assumed to be known , and the particles are chosen to fully sample all integrals of motion , the method effectively corresponds to a particle - based analogue of schwarzschild s method , and is expected to provide similar results .",
    "however , the method may be very useful when the potential is derived from the particles in a self - consistent way .",
    "not much however is known about the convergence and uniqueness of the solution in this case .",
    "the sophistication and generality of the dynamical models has reached a level that exceeds the amount of information that the observations of external galaxies can provide . as a result",
    "the observations are unable to uniquely constrain all the model parameters , which suffer from degeneracies @xcite .",
    "a key degeneracy is in the deprojection of the observed surface brightness into a three dimensional stellar mass distribution , which has been proved to be of mathematical nature @xcite and applies even when the galaxy is assumed to be axisymmetric .",
    "however , similar degeneracies are likely to exists when higher ( than zero ) moments of the velocity are considered .",
    "this is expected from dimensional arguments : the current data provide at most a three - dimensional observable ( an integral - field data cube ) , which is the minimum requirement to constrain the orbital distribution , which depends on three integrals of motion , for an assumed potential and known light distribution .",
    "it is unlikely for the data to contain enough information to constrain additional parameters , like the dark matter halo shape and the viewing angles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "numerical experiments confirm that even with the best available integral - field stellar kinematics , and assuming the gravitational potential is known and axisymmetric , not even the galaxy inclination can be inferred from the data using general schwarzschild models @xcite .",
    "this implies that the mass distribution is also quite poorly known .",
    "the situation becomes even more problematic when one considers the fact that the majority of early - type galaxies are likely to have bars .",
    "30% have obvious bars ( paper  ii ) in the atlas@xmath2  sample , but more must be hidden by projection effects .",
    "bars are characterized by figure rotation which is ignored by most popular modelling approaches .",
    "the treatment of bars could be included in the models as demonstrated in the two - dimensional limit by @xcite and as done to models the milky way in three dimension @xcite",
    ". however , no applications to external galaxies exists .",
    "this is due to the extra degeneracy that the addition of at least two extra model parameters , the bar pattern speed and position angle , will produce on an already degenerate problem .",
    "this combines with the dramatic increase in the non - uniqueness of the mass deprojection expected in a triaxial rather than axisymmetric distribution @xcite and in the additional unavoidable biases introduced by observational errors .",
    "all this is expected to further broaden the minima in the @xmath41 distributions of the fits and increase the uncertainties and covariances in the recovered parameters .",
    "we chose a different approach .",
    "rather than allowing for the full generality and degeneracies of the models , we adopt a modelling method that makes empirically - motivated assumptions to restrict the range of model solutions and improve the accuracy of the mass recovery .",
    "this is motivated by the finding that the kinematics of real fast - rotator early - type galaxies in the ` sauron `  sample @xcite is well approximated by models characterized by a remarkably simple and homogeneous dynamics , characterized by a cylindrically - aligned and nearly oblate velocity ellipsoid @xmath42 @xcite , as previously suggested by more general schwarzschild s models @xcite .",
    "the models are called jeans anisotropic mge ( jam ) , where mge stands for the multi - gaussian expansion method of @xcite , that is used to accurately describe the galaxy photometry .",
    "the jam models can reproduce the full richness of the observed state - of - the - art ` sauron `  integral - field kinematics of fast rotator etgs using just two free parameters @xcite , providing a compact description of their dynamics .",
    "the jam models are ideal for this work given that the nearly - axisymmetric fast rotator etgs constitute the 86% of the atlas@xmath2  sample ( paper  ii ; @xcite , hereafter paper  iii ) .",
    "moreover the jam models only require the first two velocity moments ( @xmath38 and @xmath21 ) , and not the full losvd , which is not available for about half of the sample ( see paper  i ) .",
    "the jam models do not have the freedom to actually fit small - scale details of the kinematics , but they make a prediction based on an accurate description of the photometry and a couple of parameters .",
    "this constitutes an advantage in presence of noise and systematics in the data , as it makes spurious features easy to recognize and automatically exclude from the fit .",
    "moreover the approach is at least three orders of magnitudes faster than schwarzschild s approach .",
    "not all etgs are well described by the jam models however : some of the slow rotators in atlas@xmath2  are likely nearly spherical in the region where we have stellar kinematics , but about 10% of the sample galaxies are weakly triaxial or out of equilibrium ( paper",
    "ii ) . for those objects",
    "the modelling results should be treated with caution .",
    "errors of up to 20% can arise when measuring masses of triaxial objects with axisymmetric models @xcite and this should be kept in mind when interpreting our results . however ,",
    "preliminary tests using real galaxies in the ` sauron `  sample indicate excellent agreement between the @xmath15 recovery using axisymmetric models and triaxial ones with identical data @xcite .",
    "moreover , in what follows , unless explicitly mentioned , we verified that all conclusion are unchanged if we remove the slow rotator galaxies from the sample .",
    "barred galaxies provide a further complication , which will be discussed in the next section .      in practice",
    "the modelling approach we use in this paper starts by approximating the observed sdss and int @xmath18-band surface brightness distribution of the atlas@xmath2  galaxies using the multi - gaussian expansion ( mge ) parametrization @xcite , with the fitting method and mge_fit_sectors software package of @xcite .",
    "the choice of the photometric band is a compromise between the need of using the reddest band , to reduce the contamination by dust , and the optimal signal - to - noise in the images . for barred galaxies the gaussians of the mge models",
    "are constrained to have the flattening of the outer disk , following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig .  4 ) .",
    "full details of the fitting approach and illustrations of the quality of the resulting mge fits are given in paper  xxi .",
    "the mge models are used as input for the jam method@xmath43 @xcite which calculates a prediction of the line - of - sight second velocity moments @xmath44 for given model parameters and compare this to the observed @xmath45 .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that , when the surface brightness distribution is accurately reproduced and good quality integral - field data are available , simple two - integral jeans models measure masses nearly as accurate as those of schwarzschild s models , with errors of 6% .",
    "the agreement can be further improved by allowing for orbital anisotropy , in which case the two methods give equally accurate results @xcite .",
    "we have run an extensive set of tests using jam to determine the @xmath15 of realistic numerical simulations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  xii ) .",
    "we found that for unbarred galaxies , even when the anisotropy is not accurately constant inside the region with kinematic data , the @xmath15 can be recovered with maximum biases as small as 1.5% .",
    "the situation changes when the galaxies are barred . in this case biases of up to 15%",
    "can be expected for the typical bar strengths we find in etgs .",
    "the models we use here were already presented in @xcite , where they were used to uncover a systematic variation of the stellar imf in etgs . that paper ( their table  1 ) describes six sets of jam models for all the atlas@xmath2  galaxies , making various assumptions on the dark matter halo . given that the ` sauron `  data are typically spatially limited to 1  one can not expect to be able to robustly characterize the shape of the dark halo out to large radii from them @xcite .",
    "however , as long as the density distribution of the halo is not the same as the one of the stars , we can determine how much room the models allow for a dark matter halo , within the region constrained by the kinematics .",
    "the models were summarized in @xcite , but we describe them here in some more detail using the same lettering notation as that paper :    1",
    ".   * self - consistent jam model : * here we assume that the mass distribution follows the light one as inferred from the de - projected mge . in this case",
    "the model has three free parameters .",
    "two parameters are non - linear : ( i ) the vertical anisotropy @xmath46 and ( ii ) the galaxy inclination @xmath47 , which together uniquely specify the shape of the second velocity moment @xmath44 , which is then linearly scaled by the @xmath48 to fit the two - dimensional @xmath45 data .",
    "we emphasize that , even though the models do not include a dark halo explicitly , @xmath48 does _ not _ represent the stellar @xmath15 , as sometimes incorrectly assumed , but the _ total _ one , within a spherical region which has the projected size of our data ( see discussion in section  [ sec : mass_err ] ) .",
    "this set of models , like all others , has a central supermassive black hole with mass predicted by the @xmath49 correlation @xcite , or a black holes mass as published , when available .",
    "the supermassive black hole has a minimal effect on @xmath15 in nearly all cases , but we still exclude the central @xmath50 from the fits , for maximum robustness .",

    "we assume the halo is spherical and characterized by the two - parameters double power - law nfw profile @xcite .",
    "we then adopt the halo mass - concentration @xmath51 relation @xcite as given by @xcite to make the halo profile a unique function of its mass @xmath52 .",
    "the latter is not a critical assumption : our observations only sample a region well inside the predicted halo break radius , so that all our conclusion are unchanged if we describe the halo with a simple power law density profile @xmath53 , as we numerically verified .",

    "we find that the correlation depends both on galaxy rotation and environment , in the sense that both for the subsamples of the galaxies in virgo , or for the subsample of slow rotators , the relation is more shallow and has a reduced scatter . in the best case ,",
    "when the most accurate distances are used , the observed scatter drops to 11% and the intrinsic one is estimated to be a mere 8% .",
    "we study the correlation between @xmath12 and the circular velocity from the dynamical models .",
    "we find that @xmath336 and @xmath20 .",
    "the relations have an observed scatter of 78% and the coefficient is independent on @xmath12 .",
    "the accurate global dynamical scaling parameters for the etgs in the atlas@xmath2  sample are used in the companion paper  xx to explore different projection of the mass plane and the variation of galaxy physical parameters .",
