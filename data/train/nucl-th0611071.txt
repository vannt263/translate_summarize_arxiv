    "the mean free path method discussed above has been studied in detail at low energies and it has been shown to solve the boltzmann eq . in the cases where an analytical solution is known @xcite .",
    "we have generalized the approach to keep into account relativistic effects .",
    "the particles move on straight lines during collisions since we have not implemented any force yet . for short",
    "we name the method proposed as relativistic boltzman equation ( reb ) . in order to test our approach ,",
    "we have discussed also some simple cases where analytical solutions are known to verify the sensitivity of our numerical approximations @xcite .    in the present calculations we enclose a pion gas in a box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the total energy of the system and the density is fixed for each calculation case according to the bosonic nature of the system @xcite .",
    "the temperature can be calculated at each time step ( after equilibrium has been reached ) from the momentum distribution of the particles .",
    "the pions can collide elastically or inelastically according to the measured data .",
    "resonances are included and their decay is simulated as well .     0 ( full circles ) , 2(asterisks ) and 3 ( full squares ) . ,",
    "width=432,height=288 ]    we recall how we include a qgp in our approach .",
    "first , for a massless quark and gluon plasma in equilibrium the following relations hold for the pressure p , quark ( antiquark and gluon ) density @xmath8 and energy density @xmath9 versus temperature t@xcite : @xmath10    where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath5 is the number of flavors . in the mit bag model@xcite quarks and gluons",
    "are confined in the bag if the pressure is less than the critical pressure b that the bag can sustain .",
    "thus from the previous equation we can assume that the quarks and gluons are liberated in a collision if the energy density is larger then 3b .",
    "this gives a critical energy density @xmath13 using @xmath14@xcite .",
    "for each h - h elementary collision we know the energy of the collision and the interaction volume from the distance between the colliding particles in their center of mass system .",
    "this distance is taken as the radius of a sphere enclosing the two colliding particles and subsequently the newly formed partons .",
    "thus we can calculate the number of quarks , antiquarks and gluons as a function of the energy density liberated in the collision inverting equation ( 1 ) .",
    "we stress that these relations are strictly valid in thermal equilibrium thus it is perfectly justified in this work since we are mainly discussing equilibrium features of our system .",
    "the partons are followed in time exactly like the hadrons solving the transport equation .",
    "in particular the partons can collide elastically with other partons and hadrons using a cross section of 1 mb .",
    "if in a collision between a parton and a hadron the local energy density is larger then the critical value , new partons are liberated from the hadron similarly to the mechanism discussed above .",
    "the possibility of collisions among partons and hadrons is necessary in order that the total system can reach thermal equilibrium . after a certain time @xmath15",
    ", the quarks can hadronize and the gluons can decay into a @xmath16 pair which later can hadronize as well . in the next section we will discuss the case when the parameter @xmath15 is infinite i.e. once the partons are formed they do not hadronize . in the following section we will discuss a possible approach to hadronization",
    "the results of our calculation when including the qgp are displayed in fig.(1 ) , for @xmath17 , where we have used 10 mev mass for the @xmath18 quarks and 160 mev for @xmath19 quarks .",
    "the relevant equation ( 1 ) has been generalized to the finite quark masses used here .    in the figure",
    "the two main features of the system are seen , i.e. at low temperature the ratio @xmath20 is less than 1 which is the value expected for a mixture of bosons with masses @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the ratio is about 4 , 12 and 16 as it should be for 0 , 2 and 3 flavors quark system respectively .",
    "such values are larger than the values obtained in lqcd calculations @xcite .",
    "this is evidently due to the neglect of an interaction among partons which is clearly important in lqcd . on the other hand",
    "the good agreement with the expected high temperature limits strengthens our numerical calculations .    in our model",
    "there is not a phase transition but simply a crossover from an hadronic state at low t to a state of partons at high t. however , the crossover is rather visible and it should have some effect in experimental data at rhic such as large fluctuations of d - mesons for instance @xcite .",
    "we obtain a cross over above 175 mev temperature depending on the number of flavors .",
    "these features are at least in qualitative agreement with microscopic lqcd results@xcite which strengthens our model somewhat . in fact , since the eos of the two systems is similar , they should give similar consequences when features of heavy ion collisions are investigated .",
    "we stress that our approach being a kinetic one could be easily extended and applied to relativistic heavy ion collisions which is the main purpose of this work , even though we will have to pay a particular attention to hadron - hadron phenomenology at higher momentum transfers .",
    "thus within this model we could study features of the collision with and without the phase transition and compare to data and/or be of guidance to more experimental investigations .     in the qgp phase.,width=624,height=384 ]    in order to improve the results displayed in fig.(1 ) and obtain a better agreement to the lqcd calculations , we recall that in the qgp phase the linear potential which keeps the quarks confined disappears while the coulomb - like term due to one gluon exchange is screened due to the color charges and similar to the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) case . in particular it is easy to realize that in order to reduce the ratio @xmath20 we need to introduce an attractive mean field @xmath21 which increases the kinetic energy of the partons , thus the temperature .",
    "we can find the value of @xmath21 for the different flavors by fitting to the lqcd results . in fig.(2 )",
    "we plot the eos obtained including the mean field .",
    "clearly , the values of @xmath7 at high t are in agreement with the lqcd results@xcite .",
    "the resulting mean field @xmath21 is plotted in fig.(3 ) as function of t. a clear linear dependence on t is observed .     , symbols as in fig.(1 ) .",
    "the best fit values to @xmath21 are given in the figure.,width=624,height=384 ]    we can easily understand this results in the abelian limit .",
    "consider for instance a quark located at r=0 .",
    "this quark will interact with another quark or antiquark located at a distance r through a screened coulomb potential@xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the screening mass@xcite and @xmath24 is the strong coupling constant .",
    "the mean field can be easily obtained summing up over all possible charges and integrating over the total volume at constant density : @xmath25 comparing eq.(3 ) to the figure(3 ) one clearly finds that @xmath26 , since the density @xmath27 , which is a well known result@xcite . in particular knowing that in the abelian approximation : @xmath28 with the charge @xmath29 . for @xmath30",
    ", we can derive the value of @xmath23 , eq.(3 ) , using the fit values in fig.3 and we can compare the result to eq.(4 ) obtaining : @xmath31 , i.e. our estimate based on a fit to lqcd results , is about a factor two larger than the abelian limit , eq.(4 ) .",
    "this difference could be expected since the gluons which have been neglected in the abelian limit play a role as well and their dynamics is also modified by some force as we have seen in figs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) for @xmath32 .",
    "in the previous section we have discussed the eos assuming that after the partons are created they do not recombine again to form new hadrons .",
    "of course we expect that this is true for the box calculations at very high temperatures , i.e. in the qgp phase",
    ". however at temperatures near the cross over and even in the hadronic phase it might happen that because of fluctuations in a given region the energy density is larger than the critical value and partons can be created .",
    "since the energy density is on average not so large there might be a possibility for partons to combine again .",
    "we would like to discuss here some possible ways to implement this mechanism and check how the eos is modified .",
    "already in a previous work of simulations of heavy ion collisions we had introduced a finite lifetime @xmath15 for quarks to combine into hadrons @xcite . to be more precise",
    "we let the quarks created at a given time @xmath33 evolve to a time @xmath34 ( calculated in the quarks rest frame ) before they can hadronize , while gluons decay after a time @xmath35 into a @xmath36 pair which can eventually hadronize after a time @xmath37 . for the hadronization",
    "we assume that quarks can combine to form resonances depending on their total energy .",
    "the use of resonances is important to conserve energy and total momentum . before hadronization",
    "the partons move on straight line trajectories and they can only collide elastically . if we adopt this scenario we obtain a surprising ( at first ) result which is plotted in fig.(4 ) . in the figure",
    "the total number of hadrons divided the total number of particles ( hadrons plus partons ) is plotted versus time for two different energy densities using a formation time of 1.0 fm / c for quarks and a similar value for the decay time of gluons into @xmath6 . at these energy densities from the previous figure ( 1 ) we expect to be at very high temperature i.e. in the qgp phase .",
    "but as we see from the figure ( 4 ) , no matter how large the energy density is the system hadronizes completely after a few hundreds of fm / c .",
    "thus the eos that we get with this assumption of a finite formation time is similar to the hagedorn one .",
    "in fact , after the first collisions some partons are created which later on hadronize in a larger number of hadrons than initially . because of the increase of the number of hadrons , the temperature decreases and eventually saturates to a value of the order of the pion mass ( the hagedorn temperature ) even if we increase largely the energy densities .     and",
    "@xmath38.,width=624,height=384 ]    in order to overcome this problem we can get some more insight in the hadronization mechanism using the bag model again . in the model the partons are confined when the density ( local ) is smaller than a critical value which can be obtained from eq.(1 ) for a fixed value of the bag constant and for each @xmath5 flavor .",
    "thus at each time step and for each particle we check the local density and if such a density is smaller than the critical value , the @xmath36 pair hadronizes or a gluon will decay into a @xmath36 .    the results of the calculations with mean field included are given in figure ( 5 ) , due to the inclusion of the condition on the critical density the partons can not recombine at high t and the expected eos is recovered .",
    "actually , the use of a condition on the density makes the use of the lifetime somewhat unnecessary .",
    "in fact even if we put the recombination time equal to zero , the partons can not hadronize if the density is too large .",
    "in this work we have applied a recently introduced transport approach to study the equation of state of a meson gas and its possible transitions to a quark gluon plasma .",
    "the model includes the possibility of resonance formation and decay .",
    "the possibility of a qgp may be included based on the mit bag model .",
    "quantum statistics can be easily included but we have seen that at the temperature discussed here those effects are negligible . the hagedorn limiting temperature is recovered for a pure hadronic system . when including a qgp the obtained equation of state is in qualitative agreement with lqcd calculations .",
    "a better description could be obtained by introducing some interaction ( attractive ) among partons .",
    "we have shown that the mean field that we have derived to fit the lqcd results gives a debye screening mass about a factor two larger than expected in the abelian limit putting in evidence the role of the gluons in our model .",
    "we have also discussed a possible scenario for hadronization assuming that @xmath36 could combine into hadrons or gluons split into @xmath36 pairs if the local density is smaller than a critical value derived in the bag model .",
    "because of the condition on the density the particles are relatively close enough in space thus it is easy to combine into resonances in order to conserve total energy and momentum of the system .",
    "this , we feel , will be especially important when dealing with finite systems in order to avoid having isolated quarks in phase space .",
    "the final goal of this work is to apply the model to relativistic heavy ion collisions at rhic and cern energies . to this purpose",
    "we believe we have a better control now on the ingredients of the model such as the effectively implemented equation of state .",
    "next we are going to concentrate on a good reproduction of the available data on elementary hadron - hadron collisions in order to be able to investigate heavy ion collisions .",
    "our efforts in these directions will be discussed in following papers .",
