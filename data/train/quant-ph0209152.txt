    "the motion of charged particles under constant magnetic field on a sphere has been introduced by f.m.haldane @xcite and several authors @xcite to discuss the fractional quantum hall effect , and compute several relevant quantities for a system of @xmath5 independent particles .",
    "the sphere is basically a macroscopic support for the motion of a large assembly of particles and its radius @xmath2 is usually of macroscopic order .",
    "however in recent years , it has been possible to realize spheres of nanostructures ranging from fullerenes size to spherical nanosize objects such as @xmath6 balls in opals @xcite .",
    "the motion of a charged particle on such spheres with constant magnetic field parallel to a given diameter of the sphere has been studied quite extensively @xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum helps to understand some interesting aspects such as orbital magnetism .    in view of future developments",
    ", it appears useful to consider the motion of charged particles on a sphere under the action of competiting forces . besides the curvature of the configuration space and the confining effect of the radial magnetic field , it may be interesting to introduce the coulomb electric force due to an ion positioned somewhere on the sphere .",
    "this situation may arise in the process of fabricating the actual sphere when a charged impurity may slip into the spherical surface and become a center of interaction @xcite .",
    "the point is thus to see how such a charged impurity affects the energy spectrum whether or not such effects are in practice relevant .",
    "moreover , the choice of a magnetic monopole generating a radial magnetic field is made to obtain analytical solutions . since a constant magnetic field parallel to a given diameter",
    "does not allow us to find an exact wave function , we replace it with a radial field which competing effects are well described .",
    "the strength and range of these effects can be described by three characteristic lengths :    * @xmath7 : magnetic confinement length .",
    "* @xmath8 : bohr radius of the hydrogen atom . * @xmath2 : radius of the sphere .    here @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    "are respectively the mass and the charge of the particle , @xmath11 the constant radial magnetic field on the sphere and @xmath12 in mksa unit .",
    "problems with three characteristic lengths do occur in physics .",
    "we may cite the case of one dimensional superconductivity in the presence of twinning defects where electron pairs are moving in constant magnetic field and a finite dirac comb @xcite potential .",
    "the three characteristic lengths involved are :    * @xmath13 : coherence length of the electron pairs .",
    "* @xmath7 : magnetic confining length . * @xmath14 : period of the dirac comb potential .    in the present case",
    "we look for stationary states of a charged particle on a sphere under a constant radial magnetic field and repelled by a point charge placed on the sphere .",
    "this is done by solving the time independent schrdinger equation .",
    "the solution will turn out to be expressible in terms of a generalization of gauss hypergeometric function called the heun function @xcite .",
    "this new function has been studied by several authors @xcite and only one type of heun function turns out to be relevant for our problem .",
    "in fact to fulfill the requirements of quantum mechanics it is necessary to demand that the heun function be defined all over the sphere and also of square integrable class .",
    "this yields a condition on one of the coefficient of the heun equation , which leads to the quantization of the energy levels .    in section",
    "@xmath15 we present the classical aspects of the dynamics showing that in particular the motion in the @xmath16-direction the energy should be larger than a certain limit . in section @xmath17 we introduce the quantum treatment which leads to the heun equation .",
    "we compute in section @xmath18 the @xmath19 and @xmath20 limit , which describes the recovery of the motion in planar geometry . in this case",
    ", the limiting problem is that of the relative motion of two equally charged particles on plane in uniform perpendicular magnetic field and under coulomb repulsion .",
    "results and comments are left to section @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 be the angular coordinates of a particle of mass @xmath9 and charge @xmath10 on a sphere of radius @xmath2 .",
    "there exists a constant radial magnetic field @xmath23 pointing outward on the surface of the sphere .",
    "@xmath23 is described by the vector potential @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( the half magnetic flux ) is the strength of the magnetic monopole generating the magnetic field @xmath23 and @xmath26 , the elementary flux unit , and @xmath27 the unit vector along the @xmath28 direction on the sphere .",
    "in fact we have @xmath29    we assume in addition the existence of a repulsive coulomb interaction due to a charge @xmath10 , placed at the north pole of the sphere , which is given by the potential @xmath30    the dynamics of the particle is given by the hamiltonian : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the canonical conjugate momenta to @xmath16 and @xmath28 .",
    "motion at constant energy is defined by @xmath34    for the sake of simplicity of the discussion we shall work with dimensionless quantities : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 defined by @xmath38    introducing the bohr radius @xmath39 the equations of energy conservation becomes : @xmath40    we see the competing roles of geometry and coulomb repulsion expressed by the ratio @xmath4 .",
    "moreover in spherical coordinates we have : @xmath41 we can then introduce a magnetic length @xmath42 and express @xmath25 as : @xmath43    hence the combined interactions can be expressed through the ratios of lengths @xmath44 and @xmath4 .    note",
    "that since @xmath45 , @xmath46 is always positive and the left hand side of eq.([eqn08 ] ) is the sum of three positive terms .",
    "now since @xmath33 is a conserved quantity ( @xmath28 is a cyclic variable ) one may set @xmath47 , with @xmath48 fixed equal to @xmath36 .",
    "the orbit in the phase space ( @xmath49 ) is a curve of equation : @xmath50    equation ( [ eqn11 ] ) can be viewed as the motion of a fictitious one dimensional particle in @xmath16-space .",
    "the potential function for @xmath51 has a minimum value @xmath52 which depends on @xmath48 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , thus the motion is only possible if @xmath55 .",
    "+ the action for a complete cycle is @xmath56 given by : @xmath57    bohr sommerfeld quantization of the @xmath16-motion by setting : @xmath58 yields the quantized energy levels through @xmath59 such that : @xmath60    unfortunately the integral can not be evaluated in closed form in terms of simple functions .",
    "this aspect will not be treated here .",
    "the hamiltonian of the motion can be suggestively reexpressed in terms of the operators @xmath61 as in @xcite : @xmath62 @xmath63 has cartesian components : @xmath64 with usual definition of @xmath65 : @xmath66 consequently with @xmath67 one has : @xmath68 and the schrdinger equation for stationary states @xmath69 reads : @xmath70 \\psi(\\theta,\\phi )   = 0 . \\label{eqn20}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as @xmath28 is a cyclic variable , @xmath33 is conserved , thus wave function @xmath69 can be set of the form : @xmath71 with @xmath72 and we get a new equation for @xmath73 : @xmath74    the choice of @xmath48 as a relative integer guaranties the uniformity of the wave function under @xmath28-rotation .",
    "we seek solutions @xmath73 which vanishes at @xmath75 because of the coulomb repulsion at the norh pole and which is square integrable .",
    "we now transform this equation with the change of variable @xmath76 to bring it back to a known canonical form .",
    "@xmath77 is now a function of @xmath78 , satisfying : @xmath79    a change of unknown function through the substitution : @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are free parameters to be chosen later , and a last change of variable @xmath83 transforms equation ( [ eqn23 ] ) into a heun equation under its canonical form : @xmath84p'(x ) \\nonumber \\\\",

    "this equation is a second - order equation with four regular singularities , located at ( x= @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) .",
    "@xmath90 is called `` auxilliary parameter '' and is significant for our problem .",
    "the solution to this heun equation is a local heun function admitting an expansion around @xmath91 .",
    "such a solution has a convergent expansion in a domain centered at @xmath91 and for @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the south pole which corresponds to @xmath94 will be a singular point since the expansion is divergent there .",
    "to get eq.([eqn25 ] ) , the coefficients @xmath81 and @xmath82 must fulfill the conditions :    @xmath95    as @xmath73 must not have singularity as @xmath75 ( or @xmath96 ) and equivalently @xmath97 must be regular for @xmath98 ( or @xmath99 ) , one must choose @xmath81 and @xmath82 positive , i.e. with @xmath100 : @xmath101    the parameters of the heun equation are then related to the parameters of the problem through : @xmath102    one possibility to make our solution valid everywhere on the sphere is to reduce the heun functions down to a polynomial . but",
    "this procedure imposes a condition which makes the radius of the sphere discrete .",

    "the other possibility is to turn to the procedure of augmented convergence @xcite which makes use an expansion in terms of hypergeometric functions @xcite .",

    "erdlyi @xcite has shown that the convergence of the series occurs in a region determined by @xmath122 this is the so - called augmented convergence phenomena .",
    "this inequality implies that the point @xmath123 lies in the interior of the ellipse @xmath124 with foci at @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "thus our wave function @xmath97 is now well defined on each pole of the sphere .",
    "the condition for which the solution of the heun equation has augmented convergence at @xmath91 and @xmath94 ( poles of the sphere ) is that the parameter @xmath90 must be a zero of the continuous fraction @xcite obtained from the three way recursion relation @xcite , i.e. : @xmath125 where @xmath126 hence for @xmath127 we can construct a bona - fide wave function for a stationary state .",

    "a lot of calculations were made in spherical ( for simplicity ) geometry @xcite then the physical effects studied in planar geometry . for example , the computation of the energy of the neutralizing background , takes a very simple form in the spherical geometry , since it amounts to put a particle of opposite charge at the center of the sphere . in this limit , the curvature of the sphere vanishes and we expect to recover the plane . we know that @xmath25 and @xmath2 are related by equation ( [ eqn10 ] ) , thus when @xmath19 , @xmath25 must go also to infinity . for physical reasons",

    "we recover then the lowest landau level ( @xmath166 ) on the sphere as exected before .",
    "it is important to note that haldane has considered only states with @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "+ to our knowledge , this is the first instance where a special class of heun function , solution of a linear differential equation with four singularities occurs in quantum mechanics .",
    "this class of function can handle physical problems which carry three characteristic lengths .",
    "the spectrum energy presents different regimes , going from the pure coulomb problem ( @xmath157 ) to the landau problem ( @xmath170 ) , passing through the well known level mixing regime .",
    "it is the main difference with the pure magnetic problem @xcite where , for weak fields , the energy levels are equally separated ( landau levels ) instead of the coulombic behavior encountered here .",
    "thus the impurity plays an important role in the weak field regime but not in the high field regime .",
    "so , the impurity can be ignored for strong magnetic fields , i.e. for @xmath25 beyond the sharp discontinuity at fixed @xmath48 .",
    "the complete study of this wave function and its properties are left for a future work .",
