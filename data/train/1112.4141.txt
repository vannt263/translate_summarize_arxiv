    "since the formulation of general relativity , about one hundred years ago , many alternative geometric theories have been proposed in order to explain gravitation phenomena ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "some of these touch one important aspect of general relativity : the conservation law . to our knowledge ,",
    "the first non - conservative theory of gravity was the steady - state model @xcite , following some ideas already presented in the end of the forties by jordan @xcite . in the beginning of the seventies , rastall proposed one new version of a non - conservative theory of gravity , following the remark that the conservation law @xmath1 may not hold true in a curved space - time @xcite .",
    "hence , he argued that new gravitational equations can be obtained considering a modification of the conservation law such that @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath4 is a coupling constant and @xmath5 is the ricci scalar curvature .",
    "hence , in the weak field limit , the usual expressions are preserved . since ,",
    "generally , the ricci scalar curvature is connected with the trace of the energy - momentum tensor , eq .",
    "( [ mot1 ] ) can be re - written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a new constant and @xmath8 is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "it is curious to remark that the phenomenon of particle creation in cosmology @xcite also leads to a violation of the classical conservation laws and , in this sense , rastall s idea may be viewed as a kind of classical formulation of that quantum phenomenon , since the violation of the energy - momentum conservation is connected with the curvature .",
    "more in detail , rastall s modification to einstein equations take the following form ( @xmath9 units ) : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a parameter ( the choice @xmath12 restores general relativity ) .",
    "note that it seems possible to have a lagrangian formulation from which the above equations are deduced @xcite . since for a radiative fluid @xmath13 , implying @xmath14",
    ", we can expect that the cosmological evolution during the radiative phase is the same as in the standard cosmological scenario . at same time , a single fluid inflationary model , described by a cosmological constant , is the same as it would be in the general relativity case .",
    "hence , rastall cosmologies may have an important departure from the standard cosmological model from the beginning of the matter dominated phase on @xcite .",
    "in order to construct a rastall cosmology which accounts for the matter dominated era and the present phase of acceleration of the universe , let us consider a two - fluid model .",
    "the first component is a pressure - less matter ( i.e. cold dark matter plus baryons ) with density @xmath15 , while the second one obeys the vacuum equation of state @xmath16 .",

    "equation  ( [ mattevoeta ] ) predicts a deviation , given by the parameter @xmath32 , from the usual dependence of the matter component with respect to the scale factor .",
    "indeed , in the @xmath0cdm model : @xmath34 . in order to constrain @xmath32 ,",
    "we use supernova type ia data , union2 sample @xcite , @xmath35 data @xcite , first cmb acoustic peak data given in terms of the @xmath5 factor @xcite , and bao data @xcite .",

    "[ fig1pdf ] .    .",
    "]    another estimation can be obtained by using structure formation .",
    "following @xcite , we see that the modification of the equation of state induced by rastall s theory at the background level , from the point of view of the general relativity framework , i.e. @xmath36 , is maintained for linear perturbations , i.e. @xmath39 ( we use the approximate sign since in @xcite the model considered is a single - fluid one ) .",
    "the cold dark matter scenario implies @xmath34 , while the warm dark matter scenario could lead to @xmath40 ( we admit that the hot dark matter scenario is excluded by observation ) .",
    "suggested by these remarks , we fix @xmath34 from now on .",
    "it is remarkable that even if @xmath11 is significantly different from one , the cosmological background of rastall s theory may lead to the same results of the @xmath0cdm model . to this end , we set @xmath34 , whose single @xmath11-independent solution is @xmath41 the above values for @xmath24 and @xmath25 lead to a particular but interesting case of rastall s theory .",
    "the above setting guarantees that the matter energy - momentum tensor is conserved in the usual sense , i.e. @xmath42    in fact , with the above hypothesis , eq .   reduces to the corresponding one in the @xmath0cdm model , without any explicit dependence on @xmath11 .",
    "we turn now to the fate of linear perturbations . we will work initially with the synchronous coordinate condition , since it leads directly to an expression for the density contrast of matter perturbations @xcite .",
    "it is more convenient , in this case , to use the field equations under the form , @xmath43 the synchronous coordinate condition implies that @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the total ( perturbed ) metric , @xmath46 is the background metric and @xmath47 are fluctuations over the latter .",
    "the fluids are represented by the following energy - momentum tensors : @xmath48 later , we shall impose @xmath49 and @xmath16 .",
    "the choice of the synchronous coordinate condition implies @xmath50 , but @xmath51 is a dynamical variable .",
    "there are in fact two four - velocities , one associated to the @xmath18 component , the other to the matter one . using this formalism ,",

    "this may have consequences for the structure formation process because we should expect an amount of clustered dark energy to be present in virialized systems , like halos of galaxies and clusters of galaxies .",

    "therefore , it seems that in the rastall cosmological models here investigated , the evolution of perturbations in the @xmath18 fluid mimic those in the matter up to the second - order perturbation regime .    the left - hand side of eq .",
    "is the same as in einstein s theory , for the background and for the perturbations evolution . as for the right hand side , using eq .",
    "( 4.16 ) of @xcite for matter ( @xmath49 ) , i.e. @xmath93 we find @xmath94 this is the same relation that one can find in the usual @xmath0cdm model .",

    "however , in the full non - linear regime one should expect some differences between rastall s model and the @xmath0cdm one .",
    "this because we have now two components agglomerating and they would gravitationally interact affecting in some manner , hopefully detectable , the growth of structure .",
    "such analysis is beyond the scope of the present paper , nevertheless we can argue some hints by considering the simple case of a spherical top - hat collapse .",
    "let us follow the growth of an inhomogeneity in the past , when the universe behaved as an einstein - de sitter one since the effects of a cosmological constant were safely negligible . following @xcite , the growth of a spherical homogeneous region is described by the equation @xmath96\\:,\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is the scale factor computed at some time @xmath98 at which the collapse begins and @xmath99 is the density parameter of the collapsing region , determined by the density contrast of the fluid there contained . here comes the relevant difference . for the @xmath0cdm model ,",
    "the only collapsing component is matter and , therefore , @xmath100 . on the other hand , in the rastall models we presented , an unknown fluid @xmath18 with a vacuum equation of state also can agglomerate .",
    "for this reason , the density parameter of the collapsing region assumes now the form @xmath101 considering now eq .   with @xmath60 , and neglecting the contribution of the constant @xmath31 , we can write @xmath102 equation   is assumed to hold true for both the models and it is easy to solve , giving the size of the perturbation , once we know @xmath103 .",
    "for the @xmath0cdm we have that @xmath104 , whereas in the rastall - type cosmological model we have one degree of freedom more than the @xmath0cdm one , because of the initial condition @xmath105 .",
    "so , in principle , one can construct the same collapsing history as in the @xmath0cdm one but with a different amount of matter , depending on the value of @xmath11 .",
    "we have shown that there is a subset of cosmological scenarios based on rastall s energy - momentum tensor non - conservation that are equivalent to the @xmath0cdm cosmology , except for one aspect : vacuum energy may agglomerate .",
    "two effects could allow to discriminate between the two models : non - linear effects in the matter power spectrum and the transfer function for cosmological perturbations .",
    "vacuum energy is negligible in the past , hence the impact of its fluctuation in the evolution of the perturbations in the primordial periods of the evolution of the universe may not be relevant .",
    "however , according to the scenario described above , dark energy must be present in virialized systems , like galaxies and cluster of galaxies , and the effect of agglomeration of dark energy must be relevant at this level .",
    "therefore , rastall s cosmology and the @xmath0cdm model seem to be distinguishable only at the non - linear regime of the evolution of cosmic perturbations .",
    "though we have given some hints of the latter possibility addressing the simple case of a spherical top - hat collapse , a deeper analysis shall be the subject of future investigation .",
