    "in various nano - structures , such as a single electron transistor @xcite , applying a time varying oscillating potential to the coulomb island can induce an inelastic tunneling event known as photon - assisted tunneling ( pat ) .",
    "pat has been intensively studied , because it can be exploited to build a highly sensitive detector @xcite or a solid - state quantum bit @xcite .",
    "so far , these studies were mainly performed in the ghz range , namely microwave - field ( mwf ) @xcite . on the other hand , the terahertz ( thz ) region , which is of fundamental industrial importance ,",
    "has attracted broad scientific interest in the past decade @xcite .",
    "however , the thz devices , especially in the region of 1 - 10 thz , have not been fully developed , giving rise to the so - called  thz gap \" .",
    "recently , experiments have been performed to implement a thz detector via the thz photon - assisted tunneling through a carbon nanotube @xcite or self - assembled inas quantum dot ( qd ) @xcite , where it was shown that both the charging and orbital quantization energies are typically 10 - 40 mev , which correspond to the thz region ( 2.5 - 10 thz ) . in the early works by the group of ishibashi @xcite , the authors found that the carbon nanotubes qd can lead to new side peaks that appear only under the thz irradiations .",
    "very recently , the thz pat in a single self - assembled two - level inas qd with @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbitals , has also been investigated by shibata _",
    "they showed that , in addition to the pat processes of @xmath0 level and the coulomb blockade oscillation of @xmath1 level , an interesting photon - induced excited state resonance ( pier ) of @xmath1 level can be observed , when thz photon frequency is larger than the energy difference .",
    "the irradiation induced pat side peaks and the pier in the presence of coulomb blockade were first investigated in the mwf devices .",
    "note that in a two - level mwf qd , the coulomb interaction is much larger than the energy difference and regarded as infinite , all the coulomb interaction related resonances are ignored @xcite .",
    "whereas in a inas qd , because the energy difference lies in the thz region , the intra - dot coulomb interaction becomes comparable with the energy difference . in this case , both the pat and coulomb blockade effects are involved together , and the finite coulomb interaction may present new features on the resonant tunnelings beyond the mwf qd .    in this paper , we theoretically explore the coulomb interaction effects on the pat processes in inas qd , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the schematic diagram .",
    "we demonstrate that , the presented peaks of our model analysis @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 agree well with @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and the pier of @xmath1 level in the experiment @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we find the side peak @xmath9 induced by the thz irradiation in our model analysis .",
    "this peak can be identified in the original experimental data , but was not addressed in the reference @xcite .",
    "in addition , beyond the coulomb blockade oscillation peak @xmath3 , we also find there exists the @xmath10 peak .",
    "this peak seems not readily discriminated from @xmath7 ( @xmath11 ) peak in the experiment .",
    "one may expect to identify both the peaks @xmath12 , which were not observed in the mwf qd due to infinite coulomb interaction , by increasing the separation between the energies @xmath13 and @xmath14 in future experiment .",

    "@xmath18 is the intra - dot coulomb interaction and @xmath19 are the coulomb interaction related energy levels .",
    "[ fig1],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in particular , we show that , to observe the interesting photon - induced excited state resonance of @xmath1 level , the coulomb interaction should be larger than thz photon frequency .",
    "these features may be beneficial for future thz devices , such as an ultra - sensitive thz detector , which may also open new possibilities of controlling carrier dynamics in quantum nanostructures by thz radiation .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we first present the tunneling model of the two - level inas qd under thz irradiation . then , we derive the formulation of average currents in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv , we analyze the inas qd experiment and explore the coulomb interaction effects on the resonance tunnelings .",
    "v is the conclusion .",
    "we consider a system of a two - level tunneling qd under the thz irradiation as depicted in fig . [ fig1 ] , where @xmath16 denotes the @xmath0 and @xmath1 energy levels in inas qd .",
    "the dot is connected to two electronic reservoirs with chemical potentials @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "then , the hamiltonian of the system can be described by @xmath23 where the first term @xmath24 describes the left and right leads respectively .",
    "@xmath25 is the single - electron energy , and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the electrons in leads .",
    "the second term denotes the hamiltonian of the central inas qd , where we have taken into account the thz irradiation and intra - dot coulomb interaction , which is given by @xmath28 with @xmath29 denoting the time - dependent energy levels of the qd under the thz fields . here",
    ", we have implemented the adiabatic approximation by introducing the thz irradiation as an oscillating potential with @xmath30 @xcite , which causes a rigid shift of @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator in the qd and @xmath18 represents the intra - dot coulomb repulsion between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 energy levels with @xmath34 ( @xmath35)@xmath36 ( @xmath1 ) or @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "finally , the third term @xmath37 describes the tunneling part , which can be written as @xmath38 here @xmath17 are the hopping matrix elements between leads and two energy levels in inas qd .",
    "now , we implement the keldysh non - equilibrium green s function method to solve this model , which offers an efficient way to deal with many - body correlations in a unified fashion @xcite . by applying this method to the irradiation problem , the time - dependent current from the left lead to the qd can be calculated from the evolution of the total number operator of the electrons in the left lead , @xmath39\\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the number operator of the electrons in the left lead . the total current can be written as a summation of the time - dependent left - going current through the @xmath41 level respectively , i.e. @xmath42 , which is given by @xmath43.\\ ] ] here , @xmath44 is the keldysh green function . with the help of the dyson equation",

    "then , the time - dependent left - going current reduces to @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the fermi distribution function of leads , and @xmath58 is the spectral function which is given by @xmath59    for the two - terminal device , the average current of each level @xmath60 can be derived with the help of eq .",
    "( [ current1 ] ) as @xmath61 and the total average current is @xmath62 .",
    "the main step is then to determine the spectral function in eq .",

    "whereas in the second term , the coulomb interaction related resonances are at @xmath69 , which can be understood as follows .",
    "first , in the case where @xmath1 level is occupied , if another electron wants to transit through the @xmath0 level , due to the coulomb interaction @xmath18 between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 levels , the energy of this electron becomes @xmath70 . on the other hand , in the case where @xmath0 level is occupied",
    ", if another electron wants to transit through the @xmath1 level , the resonance of this electron occurs at @xmath71 .    taking the retarded green function into the eq .",
    "( 9 ) gives rise to the following spectral function @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the @xmath74-order bessel function and @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) is the average electron occupation number of each energy level , which can be derived as @xmath77    note that , in the two - level mwf qd , coulomb interaction is much larger than the energy difference and can be regarded as infinite .",
    "therefore , the second term of the spectral function eq .",
    "( [ spectrum_1 ] ) is ignored and only the first term contributes to the average currents .",
    "however , in inas qd , because the intra - dot coulomb interaction becomes comparable with the energy difference , the coulomb blockade oscillations and related pats arise from the second term , which is of equal importance as the first term and may present new features . to our knowledge ,",
    "the finite @xmath18 effects have not been explored theoretically in a inas qd . here for simplicity , we assume @xmath78 and define @xmath79 . then , by solving the eqs .",
    "( [ spectrum_1]-[number ] ) self - consistently , one can obtain the average currents .",
    "in this section , we present and discuss the main results of this work .",
    "we shall first analyze the tunneling experiment through a inas qd based on the above formulation .",
    "then , we explore the coulomb interaction effects on the resonant tunnelings . to compare with the experiment",
    ", we consider the following parameters : @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 in our calculations .",
    "( a ) the total average current @xmath85 , and ( b , c ) the average current @xmath86 for @xmath0(@xmath1 ) energy level as a function of the gate voltage @xmath87 .",
    "( d ) shows the average electron occupation number @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the intra - dot coulomb interaction @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and the thz photon frequency @xmath92 .",
    "[ fig2],scaledwidth=42.0% ]      in the experiment @xcite , the coulomb charging energy @xmath93 mev , which is comparable with the energy difference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 energy levels with @xmath94 mev .",
    "the thz photon frequency is chosen to be larger than @xmath95 with @xmath96 mev .",
    "these parameters correspond to @xmath90 , @xmath97 , and @xmath92 ( @xmath98 ) in the tunneling hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we plot the average currents and electron occupation number as a function of the gate voltage @xmath87 .",
    "the main results are as follows .",
    "first , in addition to the coulomb blockade oscillation peaks @xmath13 and @xmath99 as indicated in the experiment , there also exists @xmath100 peak , see fig .",
    "[ fig2](a - b ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) , we show that @xmath1 energy level has a probability to be occupied . in this case , when an electron tries to transit through the @xmath0 level , it will be accompanied by a coulomb repulsion @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath101 , a resonant tunneling occurs .",
    "secondly , the photon - assisted side peaks at @xmath102 can be observed , with the right side peak @xmath103 in @xmath104 reduced slightly due to the competition with the nearby @xmath100 peak ( fig . [ fig2](b ) ) .",
    "however , in the total average current @xmath105 , the @xmath103 peak coincides with the coulomb blockade oscillation pat @xmath106 in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) , leading to the enhancement of this peak .",
    "thirdly , without thz irradiation , because of the coulomb blockade , the @xmath14 peak is strongly suppressed .",
    "whereas under the thz irradiation , an electron in @xmath0 level can be excited into leads , which reduces the coulomb repulsion of @xmath1 level and results in the subsequent tunneling of electrons from leads through @xmath1 level , see the pier peak of @xmath14 in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a , c ) .",
    "finally , there exist two side peaks at @xmath107 in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) . for @xmath108 ,",
    "both energy levels are above the chemical potential of leads , an electron can tunnel through @xmath1 level with the help of thz irradiation and one can observe the pat peak in the total average current ( fig . [ fig2](a ) ) .",
    "whereas for @xmath109 , the two energy levels are below the chemical potential of leads . in this case , the energy separation between @xmath0 level and leads is @xmath110 , which is larger than the thz photon frequency @xmath15 .",
    "so , it is hard to excite an electron in @xmath0 level into leads , and results in a suppression of this side peak .",
    "we now compare the above results with the inas qd experiment .",
    "we show that , the presented peaks of our model analysis @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 agree well with @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath111 , and the pier of @xmath1 level in fig . 3 of the reference @xcite .",
    "we find the side peak @xmath9 induced by the thz irradiation in our model analysis .",
    "this peak can be identified in the original experimental data , but was not addressed in the reference @xcite .",
    "in addition , beyond the coulomb blockade oscillation peak @xmath3 , we also find there exists the @xmath112 peak .",
    "this peak seems not readily discriminated from @xmath7 ( @xmath11 ) peak in the experiment . in the future , one may expect to identify both the peaks @xmath12 by increasing the separation between the energies @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we then compare our results with the mwf qd @xcite .",
    "we see that beyond the pat resonances of the two levels in mwf qd , the coulomb blockade oscillation peaks of @xmath113 appear in the inas qd . moreover , we find that the photon - assisted tunnelings of these coulomb blockade oscillation peaks occur , which also contribute to the side peaks of the @xmath0 level , see below for detailed discussions .",

    "[ fig4],scaledwidth=39.0% ]      now , we explore systematically the coulomb interaction effects on the resonant tunnelings .",
    "we first consider @xmath115 .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the results of the average currents for @xmath90 and @xmath117 .",
    "we see that , while the main resonance @xmath13 , the pier of @xmath14 , and the side peaks @xmath118 are not affected by increasing @xmath18 , the coulomb interaction involved resonances , like the peaks @xmath113 , and related pats @xmath119 shift to higher gate voltage , but the strengthen remains almost unchanged .",
    "significantly , the coulomb blockade oscillation pats @xmath120 are asymmetric with the peak @xmath121 being largely suppressed ( fig . [ fig3](a ) ) . this is because the occupation number @xmath122 for @xmath123 is much smaller compared with @xmath124 ( see @xmath125 in fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) for example ) , which makes an electron have little probability to transit into the energy level @xmath100 and thus reduces the pat .",
    "on the other hand , the coulomb blockade oscillation pats @xmath126 are quite symmetric , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) , we plot the total average current @xmath85 versus the gate voltage @xmath87 .",
    "the tunneling processes can be divided into three regimes , see @xmath125 for example .",
    "for the low gate voltage @xmath127 , we can observe the main resonance @xmath13 , the pier of @xmath14 , and the related side peaks @xmath128 or @xmath129 . for the high gate voltage @xmath130 , the peaks @xmath113 become the dominant tunneling processes . whereas for @xmath87 between above two regimes , one enters into the coulomb blockade regime , where the finite total average current arises from the side peak @xmath131 and coulomb blockade oscillation pats like @xmath132 .",
    "finally , we discuss the coulomb interaction effects for @xmath116 . in this case , the peaks @xmath133 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) ) and @xmath134 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ) now move to the low gate voltage regime and merge with the side peak @xmath103 , making this side peak hard to be distinguished .",
    "significantly , although one can see the pier of @xmath14 in the average current @xmath135 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ) , because @xmath133 now dominates the tunneling process and lies very close to @xmath1 level , the pier of @xmath5 can not be directly identified , see fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) . furthermore , while the main resonance @xmath13 , and the side peaks @xmath136 are not affected , the coulomb blockade oscillation pats @xmath132 become featureless .",
    "in conclusion , we have explored the thz photon - assisted tunneling through a two - level inas qd . because the coulomb interaction is of the same order as the thz energy difference , the finite coulomb interaction plays important roles on the tunneling processes . we demonstrate that , the coulomb blockade oscillation and pier of @xmath1 level can be clearly observed . beyond these results ,",
    "we find new coulomb blockade oscillation and pat peaks , which may be identified in further experiment .",
    "in particular , we find that , to observe the interesting photon - induced excited state resonance of @xmath1 level , the coulomb interaction should be larger than thz photon frequency .",
