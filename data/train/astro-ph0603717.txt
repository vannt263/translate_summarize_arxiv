    "cygnus  a is the exemplar of a faranoff - riley type  ii radio galaxy , marked by two large , limb - brightened lobes located nearly symmetrically around a central core source .",
    "its evolution @xcite is powered a `` central engine '' that ejects two , oppositely directed relativistic jets , which are shocked and terminated in `` hot spots '' ; driven by the momentum of the jets , the hot spots move into the ambient medium , while the shocked material flows out and `` behind '' the hot spots forming `` lobes . ''",
    "as one of the nearest powerful radio galaxies ,  ( @xmath1 , @xcite ) presents a valuable observational laboratory with which to probe , at high resolution , the acceleration and emission mechanisms within radio galaxies @xcite .    using observations at frequencies from  151  mhz to  22  ghz , @xcite performed a comprehensive analysis of the emission of .",
    "they confirmed that the lobes are powered by synchrotron emission from particles accelerated in the hot spots and then backflowing into the lobes .",
    "consistent with the notion that the hot spots are burrowing their way into the ambient medium , the spectral analysis by @xcite showed that the the emitting particles nearer the core have a greater synchrotron age than those near the hot spots .",
    "they also showed that , above  1  ghz , the spectra of the hot spots are consistent with relativistic particles being injected continuously through a strong , nonrelativistic shock by diffusive shock acceleration .",
    "below  1  ghz , @xcite found that the spectra of the hot spots flatten .",
    "they considered two explanations for this low - frequency flattening , a low - energy cutoff ( lec ) in the electron energy power spectrum or synchtrotron self - absorption ( ssa ) .",
    "they favored the former , both on observational grounds  model fits produced a superior @xmath2 for lec vs.  ssa  and on theoretical grounds  the ssa model implied magnetic field strengths within the hot spots of at least 3  , orders of magnitude above the minimum - energy field strengths .",
    "@xcite found that an lec implies a minimum electron lorentz factor of @xmath3 in the hot spots , assuming minimum - energy magnetic field strengths .",
    "@xcite also considered and rejected thermal absorption by foreground gas as an explanation for the spectral flattening as the implied electron densities are far too high for internal absorption and there is no optical h@xmath4 emission from the cluster gas within which  is embedded .",
    "the conclusion of an electron lec within the hot spots relies essentially on just two data , measured intensities at  151 and 327  mhz .",
    "@xcite conducted fairly low resolution observations ( 25 ) at  74  mhz and found a marked asymmetry , with the western lobe being significantly weaker than the eastern lobe . they re - analyzed optical observations by @xcite , finding that the amount of extinction in this direction may have been underestimated .",
    "thus , @xcite attributed the asymmetry in the lobe emission to thermal ( free - free ) absorption by foreground galactic material , postulated to be associated with a known h@xmath4 filament",
    ". however , their observations did not have sufficient angular resolution to separate the emission from the lobes and hot spots , so they were unable to address the extent to which thermal absorption affects the low - frequency spectra of the hot spots .",
    "this paper presents new , higher - resolution 74 and  327  mhz observations of  made using the vla in combination with the innermost antenna of the very long baseline array ( vlba ) connected to the vla via optical fiber link .",
    "the so - called `` vla @xmath5 pie town link '' connected interferometer provides an approximate factor of two improvement in angular resolution over the original observations in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we use these higher resolution observation to revisit the low - frequency spectra of the hot spots .",
    "our observations were conducted on  2003 august  12 with the vla in its most extended configuration ( a configuration ) and with the vlba pie town antenna connected via a real - time optical fiber link ( the  pt link ,  * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the longest baseline in the resulting array is 73  km .",
    "our observations were conducted simultaneously at  74 and  327  mhz .",
    "table  [ tab : summary ] summarizes the observing and image parameters .",
    "lcc central frequency ( mhz ) & 73.8 & 327.5 + bandwidth ( mhz ) & 1.5 & 3 + channels ( # ) & 63 & 31 + time on source ( hrs . ) & 13.6 & 13.6 + resolution ( ) & @xmath6 & @xmath7 + rms noise ( ) & 970 & 24 + peak flux density ( ) & 1040 & 113 + image dynamic range & 1070 & 4700 +    spectral - line mode was used for both frequencies with  63 channels across a 1.5  mhz bandwidth at  74  mhz and  31 channels across a 3  mhz bandwidth at  327  mhz .",
    "spectral - line mode is the standard mode at both frequencies because it is generally necessary to reduce bandwidth smearing across the wide fields of view and to allow the removal of radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .    for both frequencies , existing models of , formed from previous a - configuration observations ,",
    "were used to calibrate the bandpass response and complex antenna gains .",
    "the flux densities of these models are fixed to that found by interpolating the spectrum of @xcite . however , the distances from the pie town antenna to the vla antennas are from about  45 to  73  km , while the existing models accurately represent the structure of  only on angular scales corresponding to baselines of  35  km or less , the size of the vla a configuration . consequently , we calibrated initially only with a single short ( @xmath8  min . )",
    "time interval near the end of the observation when the elevation of  was low enough that all _ projected _ baselines to pie town were shorter than 35  km ; the models were then able to accurately constrain that antenna s gain and bandpass .",
    "models at higher resolution from higher frequencies did not result in acceptable calibration , indicating that there are significant changes in structure from higher frequencies .",
    "once calibrated , initial images were made .",
    "usually , 74 and  327  mhz vla observations require wide - field imaging to account for the non - coplanar nature of the array . extending the baseline lengths to the 70  km",
    "pt link would exacerbate the non - coplanar problem .",
    "however ,  is so much stronger than all other sources in the field of view that it is not necessary to utilize wide - field imaging as essentially no other sources can be detected .",
    "many rounds of phase - only self - calibration followed by imaging were conducted at both frequencies until the final images were obtained ; amplitude self - calibration was not used because experience shows that the gain amplitude stability is quite good .",
    "figures  [ fig:74 ] and  [ fig:327 ] present our `` pt link '' images at  74 and  327  mhz . because  is so strong , these images are dynamic range limited rather than thermal noise limited .",
    "we shall focus on the 74  mhz image for our analysis , as the flattening of the hot spot spectra should be more pronounced in it .",
    "even with the higher angular resolution provided by the pt link , the resolution of the 74  mhz image is only 107 @xmath9 71 and is insufficient to separate the hot spot and lobe emission clearly . in order to estimate the relative contributions of the hot spots and lobes",
    ", we used a higher frequency image to estimate a lobe contribution and remove this from the 74  mhz image .",
    "this method is similar to that used by @xcite to isolate the hot spot emission at frequencies above  22  ghz in their analysis .",
    "we formed a `` lobe - only '' image of  at  151  mhz by modeling the hot spots as gaussian components and subtracting them from a merlin image with an angular resolution of  3  @xcite .",
    "the western hot spot could be represented adequately by two gaussian components and the eastern hot spot by a single gaussian component .",
    "we then convolved this lobe - only image to the same angular resolution as our 74  mhz image and , assuming a spectral index , scaled it to 74  mhz . finally , we formed a residual image by subtracting the frequency - scaled , lobe - only 151  mhz image from our 74  mhz image .",
    "@xcite found a spectral index of  @xmath10 for the lobe spectra ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this spectral index appears to be too steep , at least for the lobe emission near the hot spots , as it produces systematically negative brightnesses for the lobe emission in the residual image . requiring that the lobe emission in the residual image be approximately 0",
    ", we find a spectral index of  @xmath12 is more appropriate , which we adopted .",
    "overlaying the original 151  mhz image on this residual 74  mhz image , we then selected only those pixels at the locations of the hot spots from which to estimate the hot spot emission at  74  mhz .",
    "@xcite report the hot spot emission at higher frequencies as a brightness ( units of ) for a circular 45 beam , as this resolution is sufficient to separate clearly the hot spot and lobe emissions . because our 74  mhz beam is larger than 45",
    ", we have converted all brightnesses to units of jy  arcsec@xmath13 . in doing so",
    ", we must also account for the possibility of beam dilution of the hot spot emission .",
    "both by convolving the 151 and  327  mhz images to the resolution of the 74  mhz image as well as by constructing a synthetic image containing a 45-diameter hot spot , we estimate that the peak brightnesses in our 74  mhz image are diluted by a factor of approximately 4 .",
    "table  [ tab : fit ] summarizes our estimates for the 74  mhz hot spot emission , both the nominal values estimated from the image as well as the dilution - corrected values . in making these estimates",
    ", we analyzed the two hot spots separately .",
    "we base the uncertainties on our analysis of the western hot spot .",
    "we have modeled it with two gaussian components , but a third component might also be used .",
    "we repeated the above analysis for the western hot spot using three gaussian components , and the difference between the analysis with two or three components represents our estimated uncertainty . for the eastern hot spot , we have adopted the same uncertainty .",

    "also shown are a spectrum with an , an ssa spectrum , and a free - free absorbed power - law spectrum .",
    "because the resolution at  74  mhz does not yet approach that obtained at higher frequencies , we have not included the 74  mhz data in producing the theoretical curves . in producing the lec and ssa spectra",
    ", we have repeated the analysis of @xcite , using formulae from @xcite , but restricted our attention to the data below  2000  mhz .",

    "immediately apparent is that the low - frequency spectra of both hot spots flatten or turn over and that there is an asymmetry between the two hot spots , with the eastern hot spot being approximately a factor of  2 brighter than the western hot spot (  [ sec : intro ] ) .    for the eastern hot spot ,",
    "both the ssa and the free - free absorbed spectra considerably underpredict the 74  mhz ( dilution - corrected ) brightness , while an lec spectrum agrees reasonably well . for an lec spectrum",
    ", we find a cutoff frequency of  120  mhz ( table  [ tab : fit ] ) , corresponding to a minimum lorentz factor of @xmath26 .",
    "this value is comparable to that found by @xcite , though slightly lower because we have restricted our attention to lower frequencies .",
    "the free - free absorbed spectrum can be made to agree with the 74  mhz datum by reducing the 74  mhz optical depth to @xmath27 .",
    "clearly , however , an lec spectrum can explain the 74  mhz datum without requiring any free - free absorption .    for the western hot spot ,",
    "the ssa and free - free absorbed spectra agree reasonably well with the ( dilution - corrected ) 74  mhz datum , while the lec spectrum overpredicts it by a considerable amount . on the basis of the current data",
    ", we do not believe that it is possible to distinguish between a free - free absorbed and ssa spectrum .",
    "as @xcite noted , the ssa spectrum appears to require an implausibly large magnetic field .",
    "however , this assumes a homogeneous emitting region in the source .",
    "if the emitting region is inhomogeneous , lower magnetic field values might be tolerated at the expense of making the ssa turnover less sharp , and so agree somewhat less well with the 74  mhz brightness .",
    "conversely , the inferred optical depth of unity ( table  [ tab : processes ] ) requires an emission measure of @xmath28  pc  @xmath29 , well in excess of the em values observed @xcite .",
    "@xcite found , based on lower resolution observations , that an emission measure @xmath30  pc  @xmath29 may be required to explain the low - frequency spectrum of the western lobe , and there could be clumps with larger values of em across the face of the lobe , though these would probably also mean that the reddening in this direction has been underestimated substantially .",
    "finally , it may also be possible that a free - free absorbed lec spectrum , as opposed to a free - free absorbed power - law as we have been considering previously , could explain the low - frequency data .",
    "distinguishing between the various possibilities for the western hot spot and confirming the apparent lec in the spectrum of the eastern hot spot will require additional observations . more sensitive , high resolution h@xmath4 observations would constrain the amount of foreground while additional low radio frequency observations at higher angular resolution would discriminate clearly between the hot spot and lobe emissions . at a minimum",
    ", the objective should be to obtain angular resolutions comparable to the merlin image ( @xmath31 ) , which will require baselines of roughly 200  km .",
    "multi - frequency observations , with a denser sampling of frequencies , would be useful to constrain the effects of low energy cutoffs versus free - free absorption , as well as probe the possibility of more complex ssa models .",
    "future telescopes , notably the long wavelength array ( lwa ) and the low frequency array ( lofar ) , should provide much higher resolution and a more densely sampled range of frequencies with which to probe  and similar objects .    we thank the many people at nrao involved in making the high - resolution capability of the pie town link a reality , p.  leahy for providing the 151  mhz merlin image , and d.  harris for helpful suggestions .",
