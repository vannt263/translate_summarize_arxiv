    "etwork reliability has been studied as the ability of a network to successfully carry out desired processes and operations .",
    "when those processes are only probabilistically known , the design of reliable networks might consist in the maximization of the probability of success of a given operation within a network or the minimization of its failure .",
    "sometimes the only available information is a probability distribution on the set of edges , so that the optimal decision of a global planner consists in the search of highly probable networks , under the specified probabilistic model .",
    "the first and best known probabilistic model of network formation has been introduced by the seminal work of erds and rainyi @xcite , who considered a fixed set of @xmath0 nodes and an independent and equal probability @xmath1 of observing edges among them .",
    "a related variant of this model considers networks chosen uniformly at random from the collection of all graphs with @xmath0 nodes and @xmath2 edges .",

    "this variant of the erds ",
    "rainyi random graph might be regarded as a conditionally uniform random model and a straightforward generalization of it is to consider different conditioning information , other than the number of edges . a general approach to characterize families of networks with fixed conditioning information is based on generating integer solution of systems of linear constraints @xcite .",
    "let @xmath3 be the entries of the adjacency matrix ( am , from now on ) of an undirected graph and @xmath4 the vector associated to its components sorted in lexicographic order .",

    "has been widely used to capture the fact that the probability of a network should reflect its structural properties .",
    "here we are considering conditionally exponential random graph models ( cergom ) , which keeps the main probabilistic properties of the classical ergm into a constrained sample space @xmath6 , as shown in the next section .",
    "highly probable networks are regarded as `` reliable '' in the sense of being consistent with the real - world scenario captured by the specified probabilistic model , so that the problem of designing reliable networks is here translated into the one of maximizing graph probability under conditionally exponential models .",
    "this analysis casts a mathematical bridge between probabilistic and optimization based models of network formation , which allow takeing into account the emerging properties from the point of a global planner , who wish to allocate connections among nodes in such a way as to successfully carry out processes and operations performed within the networks .",

    "the highly combinatorial nature of these problems is analyzed in the next section , based on different mathematical programming formulations .",
    "consider the set @xmath6 of undirected networks with fixed number of edges @xmath2 and an exponential model on the sample space @xmath6 , with graph hamiltonian @xmath41 , representing the number of closed triangles in the network . maximizing the logarithm of the probability inside the specified sample space leads to the non - linear binary problem @xmath42 let @xmath43 be the binary indicator of the @xmath44 triad , which is equal to one if a closed triangle between @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 exists , and zero otherwise .",
    "the following system of linear constraints characterize the state of @xmath43 : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are auxiliary variables .    by introducing ( [ eq : triad_b ] ) in ( [ eq : maxtriads_fixeddensity ] ) , for every @xmath44 such",
    "that @xmath51 , and replacing the objective function @xmath52 with @xmath53 , the maximization of the graph probability under the specified model becomes a linear program in binary variables , which can be solved up to optimality by standard integer programming technics @xcite .",
    "note that for particularly small @xmath2 ( high sparsity ) an optimal network consist of a fully connected subgraph and several disconnected nodes .",
    "one possibility to overcome this drawback is either to include more network properties in the graph hamiltonian or to redefine the sample space @xmath6 in such a way that the unwanted trivial solutions are discarded , for example by forcing _ network connectivity_.",

    "@xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the shortest path between @xmath45 and @xmath46  can be linearly modeled and introduced in the graph hamiltonian .    to measure the minimum amount of circulating flow needed to deliver one unit of flow from one node to another ,",
    "@xmath0 types of commodity - flows are defined ( one per each node ) along with @xmath54 units of each type of flow departing from the corresponding node and reaching all the remaining nodes : @xmath59 the total flow - based distance between nodes is then defined as @xmath60 , subject to ( [ eq : flowbased_apl ] ) .",
    "another commonly used network parameter is the correlation between nodes properties or the physical distance between nodes .",
    "consider a measure of distance between nodal properties @xmath61 .",
    "the total distance between nodes in the networks with respect to the space generated by the nodal properties is @xmath62 .    under the exponential family ,",

    "nonetheless , it has been widely discussed ( see handcook @xcite ) that this probabilistic models suffer of high _ degeneracy _ and lack of _ robustness _ ( or _ stability _ ) .",
    "degeneracy entails that the model places a disproportionate probability mass on only on a few of the possible graph configurations in @xmath6 .",
    "the lack of robustness can be seen from two different point of view :    * small changes in the parametrization @xmath27 give rise to drastic changes in the optimal networks ; * several alternative optimal solutions with drastically different topological structures exist .    to deal with the robustness of the optimal solution ,",
