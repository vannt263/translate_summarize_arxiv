    "the idea that the glass transition is driven by a decreasing of the number of accessible states upon lowering temperature ( or raising density ) is quite old @xcite . in this picture , if crystallization is avoided , an ideal glass transition is expected to happen at the point where the configurational entropy @xmath0 ( the logarithm of the number of states ) vanishes .",
    "when the liquid enters in the the supercooled region , the dynamics becomes slower and slower and the particles get trapped for an increasingly longer time inside the `` cages '' made by their neighbors : the dynamics of the system can be successfully described as a `` fast '' motion of the representative point in the @xmath3 configuration space inside metastable states , and a `` slow '' motion corresponding to jumps among states .",
    "entering more in the supercooled region the number of accessible metastable states decreases and the extrapolation to zero of @xmath0 defines the ideal glass transition . in experiments ( or numerical simulations )",
    "the region close to the ideal glass transition is unreachable , due to the `` apparent '' arrest of the system at the so called glass - transition temperature ( or density ) when relaxation times become longer than experimental time scale .",
    "the above scenario has been shown to be valid for many interacting systems , based on smooth pair - potential ( as lennard - jones liquids ) , for which the potential energy landscape ( pel ) approach @xcite and the replica method @xcite have allowed to give numerical estimations of @xmath0 and of the ideal glass transition .",

    "a particularly important role seems to be played by the dimesionality of the system .",

    "as the system , at enough low value of @xmath62 , begins to sample different states ( the harmonic force due to the perturbation is no more able to constrain the system inside one state ) , @xmath69 has to be chosen in such a way that the system has not yet left the state : the underlying idea is that eq .",

    "this is probably due to the fact that increasing the density the system tends to be more trapped in a local free - energy minimum .",
