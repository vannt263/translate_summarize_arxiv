    "<S> the particle localizes in the center of the lattice in the absence of constraints ( @xmath57 , left panel ) . </S>",

    "<S> the stationary distribution is @xmath60 .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fg : probabilities ] we show the stationary distribution for @xmath61 and @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath57 is denotes absence of energy constraint . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the particle localizes near the center of the lattice , a striking departure from the microcanonical maxent distribution which predicts equal probabilities for all states . </S>",
    "<S> the entropic localization results from the higher multiplicity of paths in the central region compared to the boundaries  @xcite . when average energy constraints are imposed ( @xmath63 ) , the particle balances the entropic multiplicity of paths with energetic unfavorability of states . </S>",

    "<S> the particle is allowed to jump to the nearest neighbor ( a , top ) and up to the third nearest neighbor ( b , bottom).[fg : finite_ratio ] ]    thus , asymmetry in state space topology has a huge impact on the stationary distribution . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath21 is calculated as above with a slight modification that the underlying graph of connectivity represents a periodic lattice . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath59 ( see eq .  [ eq : results1 ] ) </S>",

    "<S> inverse temperature @xmath67 is adjusted to match the numerical value of the mean energy , which allows a direct comparison . </S>",
    "<S> we study two different state space topologies . on the top </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) , we allow the particle to jump to any one of its nearest neighbors in a single transition . on the bottom ( b ) , we allow the particle to jump up to three hamming distance away . in both cases , @xmath21 is significantly different than @xmath65 especially in the region of high energy </S>",
    "<S> . how do we understand this difference ? </S>",
    "<S> on the one hand , the maxent distribution @xmath65 depends solely on the state energy @xmath68 . on the other hand , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : action ] shows that the paths that visit states of both high and low energy have a non - negligible probability thereby increasing the stationary probability @xmath21 of high energy states compared to @xmath65 . as the dynamical reach of the particle </S>",
    "<S> is increased from first nearest neighbor to third nearest neighbor , the difference between the maxent distribution and the maximum path entropy distribution gets smaller ; mean of the absolute log ratio of the probabilities decreases from @xmath69 to @xmath70 ( 0 for identical distributions ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , if the particle can jump from any state to any other state in a single transition , the maxent and the maximum path entropy predictions are trivially identical to each other  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to state - dependent quantities like energy , one may wish to constrain path - dependent quantities , like currents . </S>",
    "<S> how do path - dependent constraints change the stationary distribution ? </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the periodic @xmath49 square lattice as above . </S>",
    "<S> we constrain the average energy and a current along the positive y axis ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fg : energy_landscape ] and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fg : currents ] ) . to obtain the stationary distribution </S>",
    "<S> , we first identify the _ asymmetric _ constraint matrix @xmath71.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as above , @xmath59 is the lagrange multiplier associated with energy and @xmath72 is associated with current . </S>",
    "<S> the current in the positive y direction between states @xmath50 and @xmath73 is defined as @xmath74 if @xmath75 with appropriate corrections at @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath77 is zero for sideways movement . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath77 is antisymmetric and contributes to entropy production . </S>",
    "<S> we find the left and the right perron - frobenius eigenvectors @xmath33 and @xmath28 of @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the stationary distribution is the product of these two vectors , @xmath78 .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fg : currents ] shows the stationary distribution at @xmath79 and @xmath80 and @xmath59 held fixed at @xmath81 . at @xmath82 , there are no net currents and the stationary distribution is governed entirely by the energy constraints . </S>",
    "<S> when we increase @xmath72 to 0.1 ( center ) and 0.5 ( right ) , we see that net currents modulate the stationary distribution , a fact well known in statistical physics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can be understood by looking at path probabilities . from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : action ] , we know that paths that traverse through high energy regions have a low probability . </S>",
    "<S> but , this may be alleviated if they simultaneously carry a net favorable current . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a higher probability for energetically unfavorable states that are represented frequently in current carrying paths .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> fig  [ fg : probabilities ] , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fg : finite_ratio ] , and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fg : currents ] show that asymmetry in state space topology , finite dynamical reach of states , and path - dependent constraints all can alter the inferred stationary distribution in a non - trivial fashion . </S>",
    "<S> these effects will likely be magnified in higher dimensions and are relevant in many discrete state systems where state - based maxent has previously been employed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it will be interesting to see whether these additional features lead to better predictive models .    </S>",
    "<S> we discussed how dynamical information affects the estimate of the inferred state probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> but , we also have access to the path probabilities ( see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : action ] ) . what is the relevance of the inferred markovian dynamics to the study of diffusive random walks in general ? </S>",
    "<S> we provide a speculation . </S>",
    "<S> the two mathematical frameworks to describe random walks , the _ local _ fokker - planck formulation and the _ non - local _ path - integral formulation are often equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the local assertion that all nearest neighbor jumps on an infinite regular lattice are equiprobable is equivalent to the non - local assertion that all paths of equal duration are equiprobable . </S>",
    "<S> but , confinement and lattice irregularities lead to prominent localization away from the boundary ; a striking difference between the two approaches  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this localization is usually explained by invoking fictitious entropic forces in the fokker - planck approach . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that path based approaches may be better descriptors of stochastic dynamics especially for discrete and finite systems such as spin systems and chemical reaction networks . </S>",
