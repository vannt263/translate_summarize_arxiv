    "the non - classical correlations of entangled quantum systems are the basis for the engineering of the next - generation devices for quantum information processing@xcite . in particular , the so - called _ bell measurements _ play a pivotal role in most quantum processing techniques , as they are essential in any teleportation scheme@xcite or dense coding protocol@xcite , and recently have been proved an invaluable resource for achieving `` informationally complete '' measurements@xcite .",
    "nonetheless the bell measurements still represent a serious experimental challenge , and a general scheme for designing them would be particularly welcomed .",
    "the name _ bell measurement _ is generally designating a non separable joint measurement on a bipartite quantum system , typically a povm made of rank - one operators proportional to projectors on maximally entangled vectors @xcite . here",
    "we will focus attention on the special case of the _ bell observable _ , corresponding to an orthonormal basis of maximally entangled vectors .",
    "we will show how a bell observable can be achieved by local measurements via a ( nonlocal ) interaction of the _ controlled - unitary _ form  a generalization to dimension @xmath0 of the controlled - not for qubits  corresponding to a _ coherence - preserving choice _ among unitary transformations controlled by the state preparation of an ancilla .",
    "this result is interesting because it emphasizes the pivotal role of the controlled - unitary transformation in quantum information processing . for continuous variables the same result holds for the bell observable realized by heterodyning two radiation modes , which is connected through a 50 - 50 beam - splitter to two local observable describing single - mode homodyne measurements . in this way",
    "we will also see how a simple scheme for a controlled - unitary transformation of continuous variables can be achieved , by just using only two squeezers , a parametric down - converter , and two beam splitters .",
    "after introducing some useful notation in section [ notat ] , in section [ findim ] we prove the connection between bell and local observables for finite dimension . in section [ beamsplitt ]",
    "we give the continuous - variable case , connecting the heterodyne bell observable to single - mode homodyne measurements via a 50 - 50 beam - splitter , and presenting the optical scheme for the controlled - unitary transformation .",
    "section [ conclusion ] closes the paper with a summary and open problems .",
    "we will make extensive use of the following correspondence between hilbert - schmidt operators on a the hilbert space @xmath1 and vectors in @xmath2 @xcite @xmath3 where the double - ket symbol @xmath4 will be used to remind the correspondence of the vector @xmath5 with the operator @xmath6 on @xmath7 .",
    "the scalar product in @xmath2 corresponds to the hilbert - schmidt scalar product between operators @xmath8\\ , , \\label{eq : scalp}\\ ] ] and analogously the norm of vectors corresponds to the frobenius norm .",

(",
    "[ eq : hs ] ) .    from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : prop2 ] ) and ( [ eq : prop3 ] ) it is clear that for finite dimension @xmath12 the maximally entangled states are those corresponding to unitary operators scaled by @xmath13 , since these are the only pure states having maximally chaotic local states . for infinite dimensions",
    "we will consider dirac - normalizable maximally entangled vectors .",
    "let s consider the set of @xmath14 maximally entangled states @xmath15 , corresponding to the _ shift - and - multiply _ unitary operators @xmath16 where @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes sum modulo @xmath19 .",
    "the operators @xmath20 provide a projective irreducible representation of the abelian group @xmath21 .",
    "it is easy to check @xcite that the operators @xmath20 are an orthonormal basis for @xmath2 , whence the vectors @xmath15 are a bell basis , i. e. a maximally entangled orthonormal basis .",
    "this is precisely the basis used for quantum teleportation in refs .",
    "@xcite . for qubits ( @xmath22 )",
    "it is the basis of pauli matrices @xmath23 .",
    "our aim is now to find a unitary operator @xmath24 on @xmath25 evolving a local basis into the bell basis , more precisely such that @xmath26 where as a local basis we choose @xmath27 , the vector @xmath28 denoting the fourier transformed vector of @xmath29 , with @xmath30 in the following we will often use the short notation @xmath31 for tensor products of vectors .    a formal expression for @xmath24 is readily given since we know its action on a complete orthonormal set @xmath32 where , using eqs . ( [ unm ] ) and ( [ zw ] ) we recover the matrix elements @xmath33 as follows @xmath34 this corresponds to the following expression for @xmath24 @xmath35 thus we have @xmath36 namely the unitary @xmath24 is a _ controlled - unitary _ transformation , corresponding to choosing ( coherently ) among the unitary transformations @xmath37 via state preparation of the first system in @xmath25 .",
    "the transformation in eq . ( [ eq : contru ] ) generalizes to dimension @xmath0 the well known controlled - not gate for qubits .",
    "the present result is also in agreement with a similar one implicit in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the next section",
    "we will see how the present controlled - unitary evolution can be generalized to infinite dimensions , and how the local - bell connection is achieved by a very common device : the beam splitter .",
    "the derivation of section [ findim ] can not be generalized straightforwardly , since the group @xmath38 has no extension to @xmath39 .",
    "however , we will see how the same construction can be carried out for `` continuous variables''i .",
    "e. for continuous spectrum and bosonic modes  corresponding to an actual quantum optical implementation .",
    "let s consider two bosonic modes , with creation and annihilation operators denoted by @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , @xmath43 , respectively . in the hilbert space of each mode",
    "consider the complete sets of dirac - normalized eigenvectors @xmath44 and @xmath45 of the quadratures @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "consider the following unitary operator @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 denoting the displacement operator .",
    "notice that in the present infinite - dimensional setting the notation @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hs ] ) corresponds to @xmath51 with @xmath52 denoting the generalized vector @xmath53 the transposition of mode operators is given by @xmath54 .",
    "the operator @xmath55 can be considered as the infinite dimensional analog of the operator @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : formesv ] ) , with the orthonormal basis @xmath56 replaced by the continuous dirac set @xmath44 .",
    "the basis @xmath57 is indeed maximally entangled , with orthogonality relations @xmath58 .",
    "the following calculation proves that @xmath55 is a controlled - unitary transformation @xmath59 therefore , also for continuous variables we have a unitary operator that maximally entangles a factorized basis , and which corresponds to a controlled - unitary transformation .      in this section",
    "we will give an optical scheme for achieving @xmath55 , involving the use of parametric down - conversion and beam splitters .",
    "for a suitable choice of phases of the input and output modes , a 50 - 50 beam - splitter can be represented by the unitary operator @xmath60 the above unitary operator brings a local basis of two homodyne detectors into the bell basis of a heterodyne detector @xcite .",
    "in fact , consider the joint homodyne detection of two `` orthogonal '' quadratures , described by the generalized eigenvectors @xmath61 of the quadratures @xmath62 .",
    "it is immediate to show that @xmath63 is the generalized eigenvector of the heterodyne photocurrent @xmath64 corresponding to the complex eigenvalue @xmath65 .",
    "we will now prove the following relation @xmath66 first remind that the generalized eigenvectors @xmath67 of the generic quadrature @xmath68 can be written as @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes the vacuum for mode @xmath42 . upon rewriting @xmath71 via identity ( [ vacuumx ] ) in terms of operators acting on the vacuum ,",
    "we apply the beam splitter operator @xmath24 on the left , and after some algebra we obtain @xmath72 notice that @xmath73 .",

    "the considered bell measurement is the one used in the original teleportation proposal of ref .",
