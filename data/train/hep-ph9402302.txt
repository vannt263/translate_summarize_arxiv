    "colored supersymmetric particles  squarks and gluinos  will be produced copiously at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "the mass range up to about 2  tev can be investigated in this sector . non  strongly interacting supersymmetric particles ",
    "sleptons , charginos / neutralinos , and charged higgs bosons  can be easily detected at @xmath6  colliders .",
    "however , it is much more challenging to find these particles at hadron colliders .",
    "the drell  yan and @xmath7 fusion mechanisms yield low production rates for these particles , futhermore , the processes of interest are embedded in a complicated , jet - filled environment . charged higgs bosons can be observed as decay products of top quarks if their mass is sufficiently small .",
    "cascade decays of squarks and gluinos can lead to final states which include charginos and neutralinos .",
    "however , the analysis of cascades containing several types of unknown particles is not a simple experimental task .",
    "thus one may wonder whether other reactions could be exploited to supplement these experimental searches .    in this note",
    "we examine the possibility of searching for non  strongly interacting @xmath8 particles in @xmath1 collisions at hadron colliders .",
    "the disadvantage of this method is obviously the low @xmath1 luminosity , suppressed essentially by two powers of @xmath9 and counterbalanced only partly by large logarithmic enhancement factors .",
    "however , the disadvantage of the low production rates is compensated to some extent by the simple topology of the initial state and the potentially clean environment of the final state . if the high energy photons are emitted without breaking up the initial protons in the radiation process or by exciting low - mass states , the situation is experimentally simple . since the protons or the low mass hadron beam fragments continue travelling in the beam directions ,",
    "a clean virtual photon beam will be generated .",
    "the transverse momentum of the photon is cut off by the radius of the proton ( or some other smaller but fixed radius for low mass fragments ) so that the photon spectrum is scale  invariant .",
    "the @xmath1 luminosity based on the strictly elastic channel @xmath10 is shown by the curve labeled [ @xmath11 in fig .  1 .",
    "for small photon energies the spectrum of photons emitted from protons is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the proton mass .",
    "the photon radiation is dominated by the electric monopole transition .",
    "this is the standard weizscker - williams spectrum for photons with the virtuality integrated between the minimum value @xmath15 and the maximum value @xmath16 defined by the charge radius of the proton @xcite .",
    "the corresponding @xmath1 luminosity , normalized to the @xmath17 luminosity , can be written approximately in leading order of @xmath18 as @xmath19 these are minimal values of the luminosity since additional low  resonance excitations will raise the photon yield .",
    "besides the coherent emission of photons from the protons , photons can also be radiated from the quarks and antiquarks in processes involving the break  up of the protons , @xmath20 . in this case",
    "the photons are accompanied by spectator hadrons .",
    "the corresponding @xmath1 luminosities , based on the leading order grv parametrization of the parton densities @xcite , are displayed by the curve labeled [ @xmath21 for the lhc with @xmath22  gev in fig .  1 .",
    "for small values of @xmath23 the @xmath1 luminosity may be roughly approximated by @xmath24 where the proton structure function has been crudely parametrized as @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 is the typical scale of the @xmath1 subprocess and the parameter @xmath30 may be chosen as 1  gev , the effective non - perturbative transverse momentum cut - off .",
    "( since the formula is restricted to leading logarithmic accuracy , the precise numerical value of this quantity is inessential . )",
    "the copious number of @xmath31 sea pairs at high energies leads to luminosities significantly larger than the elastic [ @xmath32 channel .    by combining photons emitted from protons with photons emitted from quarks , a third class of @xmath1 events",
    "is generated in @xmath17collisions , @xmath33 .",
    "the corresponding luminosities are shown by the curve labeled [ @xmath34 in fig .  1 .",
    "in leading logarithmic order , with the same approximations as before , the mixed luminosity reads @xmath35 in this class of events , spectator hadrons spray only into one hemisphere , while a pure @xmath36 beam , unaccompanied by hadronic debris , is generated in the opposite hemisphere .",
    "_ ( i ) _ couple to photons in the standard way of spin 1/2 fermions .",
    "including the mass effects at the threshold , the cross section @xcite for producing a pair of identical charginos is @xmath37 \\>,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the @xmath1 c.m .",
    "energy , @xmath39 is the velocity of the charginos in the c.m .",
    "frame , and @xmath40 is the chargino mass . in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model [ @xmath41 , there are two chargino states , which are mixtures of the winos and charged higgsinos .",
    "the mass of the lighter of these states could be of @xmath42(100 gev ) , while the heavier state may have mass of @xmath42(300 gev ) .",
    "_ ( ii ) _ are spin ",
    "zero particles , the cross section for producing them is @xmath43 \\>.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the cross section is not logarithmically enhanced , thus the production rate for sleptons is expected to be significantly lower than the chargino rate .",
    "there are two slepton states in the @xmath44 for each family species , related to the left and right  handed lepton components .    _",
    "( iii ) _ , @xmath45 , will be produced at the same rate as sleptons in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "the cross sections for the elastic  elastic @xmath1 production of sleptons , charged higgs bosons , and charginos are plotted versus the mass of the produced particle ( denoted generically by @xmath40 ) in fig .",
    "2a for the lhc ( @xmath38 = 14  tev ) .",
    "these cross sections are for events in which the protons do not break up . including one - sided elastic events in which only one of the protons does not break up ,",
    "will increase the particle yield by about a factor of 5 as shown in fig .",
    "similarly , if both protons break up , the cross section increases by an additional @xmath46 as shown in fig .  2c . given an integrated luminosity of @xmath47 at the lhc for one year of operation",
    ", about 10 chargino pairs will be generated for a chargino mass of 150 gev in elastic ",
    "elastic events ; if one - sided elastic events are also included , this number increases to about 50 chargino pairs .",
    "given the clean final states , these event numbers appear large enough to be interesting .",
    "slepton and charged higgs boson cross sections are smaller by about a factor 5 . for an integrated luminosity of @xmath48 per year a sample of 500 chargino pairs",
    "will be generated at a mass of 150 gev .",
    "and @xmath49 type processes at the lhc in ref .",
    "even though a pile - up of events will occur in this situation , the very small transverse momenta of the pile - up events will help to eliminate them .",
    "exceed the yield that could be expected at dedicated photon ",
    "proton colliders in which invariant energies @xmath50 of 1 tev may be reached @xcite",
    ". however , they are significantly smaller than the event rates at @xmath1 colliders in which the photons are generated by compton back - scattering of laser light at @xmath6 linear colliders .    among other decay modes , charginos decay into @xmath51 s and the lightest neutralino ( lsp ) which is assumed to be stable in the present context .",
    "sleptons may decay into their leptonic standard model partners and the lsp , charged higgs bosons decay into @xmath52 etc .",
    "therefore we have also calculated the background cross sections for @xmath53 and @xmath54 . since these cross sections become very large for forward / backward scattering , we have applied cuts on the rapidity , @xmath55 , and the transverse momentum , @xmath56 20 gev , of the final state particles .",
    "the invariant mass of the pair is also required to satisfy @xmath57 . despite these cuts , the @xmath58 and @xmath59 backgrounds are still much larger than the signal cross sections . however , in @xmath60 and @xmath54 events the transverse momenta of the @xmath51 s or @xmath61 s are balanced , in contrast to the signal events in which the transverse momenta of the final state @xmath51 or @xmath61 particles are different due to the escaping invisible lsp s . by rejecting events in which the @xmath51 or @xmath61 transverse momenta balance to within about 10  gev , the backgrounds are reduced considerably while the signals are little affected .",
    "_ in summa_. @xmath1 collisions induced by initial state bremsstrahlung of photons at the lhc may provide production channels to search for non  strongly interacting supersymmetric particles .",
    "the low rates are compensated in part by the clean environment in which the novel particles can be generated in the class of two- and one - sided elastic @xmath1 events .",
    "these events can in principle be selected by vetoing events with visible forward particles in both hemispheres .",
    "the final state topology of doubly inelastic @xmath1 events is somewhat similar ( but not identical ) to the drell - yan processes , which have larger cross sections . without a detailed calculation including the distributions for the two processes and the detector acceptance , it is not possible to make a clear statement on how useful the @xmath0 process will prove to be in this case .",
    "we prefer to emphasize here the clean nature of the doubly elastic and elastic - inelastic events .    of course , we can not analyze the experimental triggering problems for the elastic - elastic and elastic - inelastic events .",
    "our present theoretical estimates are intended as an exploratory survey of the general physics opportunities in @xmath1 collisions at the lhc .",
