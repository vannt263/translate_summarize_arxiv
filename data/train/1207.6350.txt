    "recently @xcite , a detailed study of the mcvittie solution @xcite was carried out for a non - negative cosmological constant ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the mcvittie solution has been known for many years , but it continues to attract interest @xcite .",
    "even though it is now widely believed that the universe is dominated by a positive cosmological constant , the remarkable ads / cft correspondence @xcite presents a strong argument that the case @xmath3 should also be examined .",
    "following @xcite we systematically construct a global view of the mcvittie solution with @xmath3 based on numerical integrations of the null geodesics . what results is a situation very distinct from the case @xmath2",
    ": the global structure is completely dominated by a collapse to a big crunch , just as in the pure robertson - walker case .",
    "for a perfect fluid with energy density @xmath4 and isotropic pressure @xmath5 the strong energy condition @xcite is given by @xmath6 for a robertson - walker background with scale factor @xmath7 , for ( [ tl ] ) , einstein s equations with @xmath8 give @xmath9 where @xmath10 , and so we necessarily have a big crunch @xcite . the particular solution we are concerned with here",
    "is the simplest of the mcvittie class , and this can be written in the form ( e.g. @xcite ) @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is a positive constant and @xmath14 is the metric of a unit 2-sphere . if the mcvittie solution ( [ metric1 ] ) asymptotes to a reasonable robertson - walker background , then , as in the pure robertson - walker case , @xmath15 gives rise to a big crunch which dominates the global structure .",
    "as previously @xcite , we use the coordinate transformation @xmath16 to obtain @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the hubble function @xmath20 . from ( [ metric2 ] )",
    "it follows that tangents to surfaces of constant finite @xmath21 are spacelike for @xmath22 ( and so for finite @xmath21 we set the future orientation @xmath23 for affine @xmath24 increasing to the future ) and tangents to surfaces of constant @xmath25 are spacelike for @xmath26 , null for @xmath27 and timelike for @xmath28 .",
    "we note again that the effective gravitational mass @xcite associated with ( [ metric2 ] ) is not @xmath13 , but rather @xmath29 , given by @xmath30      quite unlike @xcite , we note that because of ( [ ray ] ) , @xmath31 rather , we are now interested in models for which @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 note that from ( [ mass ] ) @xmath35 and from ( [ ray ] ) @xmath36    whereas from the definition of @xmath37 , @xmath38 for all finite @xmath39 , from the transformation ( [ rdef ] ) @xmath40 as a result , neither @xmath41 nor @xmath42 are part of the spacetime ( [ metric2 ] ) for @xmath43 .",
    "we note that ( [ rlim ] ) shows us that there is no continuous transition from @xmath43 to @xmath44 .      as explained previously @xcite , singularities , as revealed by scalars polynomial in the riemann tensor ,",
    "are reflected here by the ricci scalar @xmath45 , @xmath46 since all other invariants , derived from ( partial ) derivatives of the metric tensor no higher than 2 , add no new information in the cases under consideration . for @xmath47 , since @xmath48 , there are singularities at @xmath49 , which are spacelike .",
    "the apparent singularities at @xmath50 and at @xmath42 at @xmath41 and @xmath42 . ] , over the range @xmath51 are , as explained above , not part of the spacetime .      as in the previous analysis @xcite ,",
    "the locus @xmath52 is important for an understanding of the spacetime ( [ metric2 ] ) .",
    "however , due to the nature of the function @xmath19 studied here , this locus is quite distinct from the locus studied in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the roots @xmath53 studied there do not exist for @xmath1 .",
    "first let us note that the locus @xmath52 includes @xmath54 at @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath57 along the locus , @xmath25 can have a vertical tangent in the @xmath58 plane on @xmath59 and @xmath60 only at @xmath61 .",
    "as @xmath62 the locus becomes @xmath63 which requires @xmath64 , that is , @xmath65 .",
    "the radial null geodesics of ( [ metric2 ] ) satisfy @xmath66 we label the branch  + \"  outgoing \" and the branch  - \"  ingoing \" .",
    "clearly @xmath67 and so the ingoing geodesics already have @xmath68 at @xmath69 whereas the outgoing geodesics have @xmath70 at @xmath69 .",
    "further , @xmath71 at @xmath52 for ingoing null geodesics when @xmath72 and for outgoing null geodesics when @xmath73 .",
    "since @xmath70 along both branches for @xmath74 and @xmath75 and @xmath68 along both branches for @xmath74 and @xmath76 it follows that the ingoing geodesics reach a maximum @xmath25 at @xmath52 for @xmath75 and the outgoing geodesics reach a maximum @xmath25 at @xmath52 for @xmath76 .",
    "a special case is shown below in figure [ figure2 ] and figure [ figure3 ] .",
    "let us start by rewriting the energy density and isotropic pressure in terms of @xmath19 . from einstein s equations with @xmath15",
    "we find @xmath77 as a result , with ( [ hdotneg ] ) , a general feature of these models is @xmath78 and @xmath79 and so the null and weak energy conditions are always satisfied .",
    "the strong energy condition requires @xmath80 which , from ( [ rhoph ] ) , gives @xmath81 the dominant energy condition requires @xmath82 it follows from ( [ hdotneg ] ) , ( [ rhoph ] ) and ( [ domgen ] ) that whereas the left - hand inequality is generally satisfied , the right - hand inequality requires @xmath83",
    "we can not proceed with further details without a specific form for @xmath19 . for notational convenience , and for a comparison with @xcite , define @xmath84 and take @xmath85 .",
    "for @xmath86 we take the robertson - walker scale factor for spatially flat dust with @xmath1 .",
    "this gives @xmath87 clearly @xmath19 is periodic with period @xmath88 and so @xmath89 .",
    "moreover , @xmath90 the dominant feature in our study is the development of a big crunch .",
    "we know that this will occur with @xmath8 as long as the strong energy condition holds . for more general equations of state ,",
    "say @xmath91 , the strong energy condition gives @xmath92 .",
    "since the minimum @xmath93 in our considerations is @xmath94 , we would recover the same structure for @xmath95 . in this sense",
    "our choice of @xmath96 is not critical .",
    "from ( [ strong ] ) we find that the strong energy condition is satisfied for @xmath97 since the left side of ( [ strongspecial ] ) is at least @xmath98 , we see that the strong energy condition is always satisfied . for the dominant energy condition we rearrange ( [ right ] ) to give    @xmath99    and",
    "so the dominant energy condition fails sufficiently close to the singularities .",
    "with ( [ special ] ) we can write the null geodesic equations ( [ geodesic ] ) in the dimensionless form @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 is the parameter @xmath104 . numerical integrations of ( [ dimgeo ] ) are shown in figures [ figure2 ] and [ figure3 ] .",
    "as previously @xcite , we find it numerically convenient to compactify @xmath25 and define @xmath106 so that equation ( [ dimgeo ] ) takes the form @xmath107 numerical integrations of ( [ zform ] ) are shown in figure [ figure4 ] .",
    "any point in the spacetime @xmath108 can be connected to the past boundary @xmath109 by a unique null geodesic from each branch .",
    "we use this to construct the conformal diagram below .",
    "we represent the past boundary as a horizontal line in a cartesian plane ( @xmath111 ) , setting the right end of @xmath54 at @xmath112 , and the left end at @xmath113 . to represent the interval @xmath114 , from @xmath115 to @xmath116",
    ", we only require a one - to - one function between these two variables .",
    "our choice for @xmath117 is given in the appendix .",
    "this function was chosen purely for visual reasons by finding the spline curve fit of several points that were adjusted manually to make the resulting conformal diagram more visually appealing .",
    "note that the choice of the shape of the curve ( @xmath118 ) to be a horizontal straight line , as well as the function @xmath117 used is arbitrary and does not change the overall global structure presented in the conformal diagram .",
    "it is only required that the curve ( @xmath118 ) be space - like , and the function @xmath117 be one - to - one .",
    "after this point , the procedure we used is identical to that in @xcite .      under the procedure described above , figure [ figure4 ]",
    "is mapped into figure [ nullgeo ] .",
    "conformal representations of surface of constant @xmath25 and constant @xmath119 are shown in figures [ consr ] and [ const ] respectively .      the conformal representation of the fluid streamlines @xmath120 is shown in figure [ fluid ] .",
    "these trajectories are , of course , globally timelike . from ( [ rdef ] )",
    "we have @xmath121 for @xmath122 .",
    "the scale factor is @xmath123 where @xmath124 is a constant @xmath125 .",
    "writing @xmath126 we have @xmath127 and we note that @xmath128 for @xmath129 and @xmath130 where @xmath131 note that @xmath132{2 } < \\epsilon < \\infty$ ] as explained in the figure .",
    "motivated by the ads / cft correspondence , we have examined the mcvittie solution with a negative cosmological constant @xmath15 .",
    "a detailed construction of the global structure has been given for the case of a background of dust .",
    "we have found that the situation is very distinct from the cases @xmath2 @xcite . as in the pure robertson - walker case , we find that @xmath1 ensures collapse to a big crunch , a feature which completely dominates the global structure .",
