    "the problem of the origin of large scale structures is till now one of the most enigmatic ones .",
    "it is commonly accepted that presently observed structures originated from almost isotropic distribution in the early universe .",
    "the departure from isotropy , as estimated from cmbr is of the order of @xmath0 .",
    "about a half century ago the main problems were connected with type of the perturbations , its amplitude and scale ( mass or length ) .",
    "different theories of galaxy origin called scenarios predicted various masses of newly originate structures and various manners in which galaxy gained angular momentum ( peebles 1969 , zeldovich 1970 , sunyaev & zeldovich 1972 , doroshkevich 1973 , shandarin 1974 , wesson 1982 , silk & efstathiou 1983 , bower et al . 2005 ) . in some scenarios ,",
    "the distribution of galaxy angular momenta in structure were random ones , in others perpendicular or parallel to the structure main plane ( peebles 1969 , doroshkevich 1973 , shandarin 1974 , silk 1983 , catelan & theuns 1996 , li 1998 , lee & pen 2002 , navarro et al .",
    "2004 , trujillio et al .",
    "in such a manner , the existence or not of the galaxy orientation can be used for testing scenarios of galaxy origin . because the real location of rotation axes is known for very small number of objects , usually the study of orientation of galaxy planes is performed . in contemporary picture of large scale distribution known as `` cosmic web ''",
    "we practically have four components .",
    "these are long filaments , walls , voids and the rich , dense regions called galaxy clusters .    in our previous paper ( godowski & flin 2010 ) we studied the orientation of galaxy groups in the local supercluster .",
    "we found the strong alignment of the major axis of the groups with both direction toward the supercluster centre ( virgo cluster ) as well as with line joing two brightest galaxies in the group .",
    "the interpretation of these observational facts was the following . the brightest ( belived to be the most massive ) galaxies of the group originate first .",
    "due to gravitational forces other galaxies are attracted to these ones and a filament is forming .",
    "the other possibility is that at the pre- existing filament galaxies are forming . in this direction",
    "is going the result of jones et al .",
    "( 2010 ) which interpretet theirs founding that the spins of spiral galaxies located within cosmic web filaments tend to be aligned along the larger axis of the filament , as `` fossil '' evidence indicating that the action of large scale tidal torques effected the alignments of galaxies located in cosmic filaments .    in the paper of godowski et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , when analizing the sample of 247 rich abell clusters , we found that the alignment of member galaxies in rich structures , having more than 100 members , is a function of the group mass .",
    "richer group exhibits stronger galaxy alignment .",
    "the change of alignment with the surrounding neigbourhood was observed also in alignment study in void vicinity ( varela et al .",
    "2011 ) , being continuation of earlier study of galaxy orientation in regions surrounding bubble - like voids ( trujillo et al .",
    "they found that disk galaxies around large voids ( greater than @xmath1 ) present a significant tendency to have their angular momenta aligned with the void s radial direction .",
    "the strength of this alignment is dependent on the void s radius and for voids with @xmath2 the distribution of the orientation of the galaxies is compatible with a random distribution .",
    "varela et al . (",
    "2011 ) found that this trend observed in the alignment of galaxies is similar to that observed in numerical simulations of the distribution of dark matter i.e. in distribution of the minor axis of dark matter halos around cosmic voids , which suggests a possible link in the evolution of both components .    in view of these facts , it is interesting to look if the the cluster belonging to the larger structures exhibit the same type of alignment as whole sample of the clusters .",
    "for this reason , we analize the alignment of the cluster members of galaxies for the clusters belonging to the superclusters .",
    "this problem was not investigated till now , although aligment of galaxies in the superclusters was investigated many times .",
    "presence of non - random galaxy spin orientation has been ascertained both in the local supercluster ( for example macgillivray et al .",

    "aryal , neupane and saurer 2008 , aryal , paudel and saurer 2008 ) and in other superclusters , as the hercules supercluster , coma / a 1367 and the perseus supercluster ( gregoryet al .",

    "1997 , cabanela and aldering 1998 , flin 2001 ) .",
    "the pf catalogue of galaxy structures ( panko & flin 2006 ) was used as observational basis of the present study .",
    "this catalogue was constructed by finding structures in the muenster red sky survey ( mrss ) ( ungruheet al .",
    "we used the voronoi tessellation technique for structure finding .",
    "mrss is a large - sky galaxy catalogue covering an area of about 5000 square degrees on the southern hemisphere .",
    "it is the result of scanning of 217 eso plates , giving positions , red magnitudes , radii , ellipticities and position angles of about 5.5 million galaxies and it is complete down to @xmath3 . as a result we have 6188 galaxy structures called clusters . using standard covariance elipse method we determined structure ellipticity and position angles .",
    "we chose the sample of 247 very rich clusters , having at least 100 members each , and being identified with one of the aco clusters ( abell et al .",
    "1989)- see godowski et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for details .",
    "the pf catalogue served also as a basis for supercluster detection .",
    "we found 54 superclusters having at least 4 clusters each . as expected , superclusters are rather flat structures ( see fig . [",
    "fig : f1 ] ) .",
    "we found that @xmath4 from total member of @xmath5 clusters belong to the superclusters and they were chosen for detailed analyzis .",
    ".the frequency of anisotropy of very rich clusters located in superclusters [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the tab.5 we presented value of analyzed statistics for different superclusters richness .",
    "generally the anisotropies decreased with the superclusters richness .",
    "anisotropy for the angles @xmath6 and @xmath7 seems to increase again for very rich supercluster .",
    "one should note however , that subsample of supercluser richness @xmath8 contain significantly less clusters ( @xmath9 ) in comparision to the poorer superclusters and moreover two cluster belonging to this bin have possible double identifications .",
    "result of linear regresion between values of analized statistics and supercluster richness presented on the fig.3 and in tab.6 generally confirmed above conclusion , with exception for @xmath7 angle where infuence of the @xmath8 bin is significant . because our binned analizis is based only for 3 bins it is difficult to decide about statistical significance of this results .",
    "for this reason we repeat our analyzis for not binned sample of 46 clusters ( 3 of them have possible double identifications ) . analising statistics",
    "@xmath10 which has student s distribution with @xmath11 degrees of freedom , we conclude that only in the case of the @xmath12 angle decreasing the anisotropy with the supercluster richness is statisticaly significant on the level of @xmath13",

    "we investigated sample of @xmath4 rich abell galaxy cluster belonging to the supercluster and having at least 100 mebers in the considered area . as expected , the analised superclusters are rather flat structures .",
    "we found that orientation of galaxies in the analised cluster are not random .",
    "godowski et al . (",
    "2011 ) found that for the rich abell cluster alignment increases with the cluster richness .",
    "in contrast , the cluster belonging to the superclusters does not show such effect .",
    "the alignment in poor supercluster is greater that in the case of rich one . the obtained results , which show the dependence of galaxy alignment on both the cluster location inside or outside the supercluster and the supercluster richness clearly suport the influence of environmental effects to the origin of galaxy angular momenta . in a very simple and naive picture ,",
    "if the alignment of galaxies is primordial , the strongest effect should be observed in small structures .",
    "however , in the present moment we do not have such data .",
    "we considered only really very rich clusters and looked for trends .",
    "it could be accepted that gaining of angular momenta for galaxies in structure is a rather complicated problem , in which several mechanism played roles . in some cases the angular momentum of galaxies is due to local anisotropic collapse of a protostructures , in other ones due to tidal torque mechanism . moreover , cluster merging introduces additional factors influencing the observed distribution of galaxy angular momenta .",
    "this suggests that the environment played crucial role in origin of galaxy angular momentum .",
    "our result is preliminary because our investigations were based on sample of only very rich clusters and will be continued with analizis of the structures with various richness taken into account .",
    "fortunately , pf catalogue will allow us to perform such analysis .",
