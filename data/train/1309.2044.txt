    "to explain the cosmic acceleration found by the observations of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) in 1998 @xcite , we usually introduce dark energy with negative pressure which consists about 70% of the total energy density in the universe .",
    "the cosmological constant with the constant equation of state @xmath5 is the simplest candidate of dark energy and it is consistent with current observational data , but its value is too small compared with that estimated from the vacuum energy of quantum field theory .",
    "dynamical fields with scalar field such as quintessence @xcite , phantom @xcite , tachyon @xcite and k - essence @xcite were proposed for dark energy .",
    "the scalar field rolls down a very shallow potential , so its equation of state @xmath2 will approach @xmath6 and it dominates the universe only recently . according to its evolution , the scalar field was classified to several categories .",
    "if the scalar field stuck in a local minimum and starts to roll down to the true minimum until recently , the dark energy models are called thawing models @xcite . for thawing models , @xmath2 starts with the value -1 at early times and then deviates from -1 at the present time .",
    "if the scalar field already rolls down its potential minimum before the onset of acceleration and it slows down as it comes to dominate the universe , the models are called freezing models @xcite . for the freezing models , @xmath2 is different from -1 at early times and approaches -1 at the present time . if @xmath7 initially and @xmath2 decreases as the scalar field rolls down its potential , the models are called cooling models @xcite . for the tracking models , the equation of state @xmath2 tracks below the background equation of state for a wide range of initial conditions ,",
    "the tracker fields become dominate only recently and then it slows to crawl with @xmath8 as @xmath9 asymptotically .",
    "both the freezing and tracking models are special cases of cooling models . due to",
    "the hubble damping and the shallow potential , the variation of @xmath2 is bounded @xcite . for the thawing quintessence models ,",
