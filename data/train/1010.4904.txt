    "in the last 20 years , there has been an increasing interest in non - continuous stochastic processes . in particular",

    "first , we show that the hitting probability of a borel set with positive measure is positive .",
    "then we prove the harnack inequality using krylov - safonov s approach @xcite . in section [ regularity ] , we study regularity of these @xmath2-harmonic functions and prove their hlder continuity . + one of the ways to obtain an @xmath2-harmonic function is to extend a function on @xmath0 which can be taken as the boundary of @xmath5 .",
    "this is also known as the dirichlet problem for the upper - half space .",
    "we define the solution of this problem by means of the semigroup corresponding to @xmath4 . then in the last section",
    ", we state some results on littlewood - paley functions studied by p.a .",
    "meyer and n.varopoulos and then prove a result on a partial littlewood - paley function by using harnack inequality .",
    "in this section , we give the details of the setup and introduce the notation which will be used for the rest of the paper .",
    "we consider the space @xmath0 with d - dimensional lebesgue measure @xmath6 and the upper - half space @xmath7 as a subspace of @xmath8 . for simplicity",

    "we will denote transition densities of this symmetric stable process by @xmath28 .",
    "unlike brownian motion , there is nt any simple explicit formula for the transition densities .",

    "hence @xmath32 is continuous and differentiable in the variable @xmath25 .",
    "this stable process @xmath16 forms the horizontal component of our product process if we think @xmath0 as the horizontal and @xmath1 as the vertical component of @xmath5 . on the vertical direction we let @xmath37 be a one dimensional brownian motion which is independent from @xmath16 , and",
    "so the product process is @xmath38 .",

    "we note that @xmath41 depends only on @xmath37 by independence of @xmath16 and @xmath37 .",

    "the main idea is based on the relation between a deterministic integral and a probabilistic integral . for the conversion between these two integral",
