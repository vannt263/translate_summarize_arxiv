    "these days a large variety of complex statistical models can be fitted routinely to complex data sets as a result of widely accessible high - level statistical software , such as ` r ` [ @xcite ] or ` winbugs ` [ @xcite ] .",
    "for instance , the nonspecialist user can estimate parameters in generalized linear mixed models or run a gibbs sampler to fit a model in a bayesian setting , and expert programming skills are no longer required .",
    "researchers from many different disciplines are now able to analyze their data with sufficiently complex methods rather than resorting to simpler yet nonappropriate methods .",
    "in addition , methods for the assessment of a model s fit as well as for the comparison of different models are widely used in practical applications .",
    "the routine fitting of spatial point process models to complex data sets , however , is still in its infancy .",
    "this is despite a rapidly improving technology that facilitates data collection , and a growing awareness of the importance and relevance of small - scale spatial information .",
    "spatially explicit data sets have become increasingly available in many areas of science , including plant ecology [ @xcite ; @xcite ] , animal ecology [ @xcite ( @xcite ) ] , geosciences [ @xcite ; @xcite ] , molecular genetics [ @xcite ] , evolution [ @xcite ] and game theory [ @xcite ] , with the aim of answering a similarly broad range of scientific questions .",
    "currently , these data sets are often analyzed with methods that do not make full use of the available spatially explicit information .",
    "hence , there is a need for making existing point process methodology available to applied scientists by facilitating the fitting of suitable models .",
    "in addition , real data sets are often more complex than the classical data sets that have been analyzed with point process methodology in the past .",
    "they often consist of the exact spatial locations of the objects or events of interest , and of further information on these objects , that is , potentially dependent qualitative as well as quantitative marks or spatial covariates [ @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "there is an interest in fitting complex joint models to the marks ( or the covariates ) as well as to the point pattern .",
    "so far , the statistical literature has discussed few examples of complex point process models of this type",
    ".    there have been previous advances in facilitating routine model fitting for spatial point processes , in particular , for gibbs processes .",
    "most markedly , the work by baddeley and turner ( @xcite ) has facilitated the routine fitting of gibbs point processes based on an approximation of the pseudolikelihood to avoid the issue of intractable normalizing constants [ @xcite ; @xcite ] as well as the approximate likelihood approach by @xcite .",
    "work by @xcite and @xcite has provided methods for model assessment for some gibbs processes .",
    "many of these have been made readily available through the library ` spatstat ` for ` r ` [ @xcite ] .",
    "however , most gibbs process models considered in the literature are relatively simple in comparison to models that are commonly used in the context of other types of data . in an attempt to generalize the approach in @xcite ,",
    "@xcite include random effects in gibbs point processes but more complex models , such as hierarchical models or models including quantitative marks , currently can not be fitted in this framework .",
    "similarly , methods for model comparison or assessment considered in @xcite and @xcite are restricted to relatively simple models .",
    "furthermore , both estimation based on maximum likelihood and that based on pseudolikelihood are approximate so that inference is not straightforward .",
    "the approximations become less reliable with increasing interaction strength [ @xcite ] .",
    "cox processes are another , flexible , class of spatial point process models [ @xcite ] , assuming a stochastic spatial trend makes them particularly realistic and relevant in applications .",
    "even though many theoretical results have been discussed in the literature for these [ @xcite ] , the practical fitting of cox point process models to point pattern data remains difficult due to intractable likelihoods .",
    "fitting a cox process to data is often based on markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods .",
    "these require expert programming skills and can be very time - consuming both to tune and to run [ @xcite ] so that fitting complex models can easily become computationally prohibitive . for simple models , fast",
    "minimum contrast approaches to parameter estimation have been discussed [ @xcite ] .",
    "however , approaches to routinely fitting cox process models have been discussed very little in the literature ; similarly , methods for model comparison or assessment for cox processes have rarely been discussed in the literature [ @xcite ; @xcite ] . to the authors knowledge ,",
    "cox processes have not been used outside the statistical literature to answer concrete scientific questions . within the statistical literature cox process models",
    "have focused on the analysis of relatively small spatial patterns in terms of the locations of individual species .",
    "very few attempts have been made at fitting models to both the pattern and the marks [ @xcite ; @xcite ] , in particular , not to patterns with multiple dependent continuous marks , and joint models of covariates and patterns have not been considered .",
    "this paper addresses two issues .",
    "it develops complex joint models and , at the same time , provides methods facilitating the routine fitting of these models .",
    "this provides a toolbox that allows applied researchers to appropriately analyze realistic point pattern data sets .",
    "we consider joint models of both the spatial pattern and associated marks as well as of the spatial pattern and covariates .",
    "using a bayesian approach , we provide modern model fitting methodology for complex spatial point pattern data similar to what is common in other areas of statistics and has become a standard in many areas of application , including methods for model comparison and validation .",
    "the approach is based on integrated nested laplace approximation ( inla ) [ @xcite ] , which speeds up parameter estimation substantially so that cox processes can be fitted within feasible time . in order to make the methods accessible to nonspecialists , an ` r ` package that may be used to run inla is available and contains generic functions for fitting spatial point process models ; see http://www.r - inla.org/.      applied researchers are aware that spatial behavior tends to vary at a number of spatial scales as a result of different underlying mechanisms that drive the pattern [ @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "local spatial behavior is often of specific interest but the spatial structure also varies on a larger spatial scale due to the influence of observed or unobserved spatial covariates .",
    "cox processes model spatial patterns relative to observed or unobserved spatial trends and would be ideal models for these data sets",
    ".    however , cox processes typically do not consider spatial structures at different spatial scales within the same model .",
    "more specifically , a specific strength of spatial point process models is their ability to take into account detailed information at very small spatial scales contained in spatial point pattern data , in terms of the local structure formed by an individual and its neighbors .",
    "so far , cox processes have often been used to relate the locations of individuals to environmental variation , phenomena that typically operate on larger spatial scales . however , different mechanisms operate at a smaller spatial scale .",
    "spatial point data sets are often collected with a specific interest in the local behavior of individuals , such as spatial interaction or local clustering [ @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "we consider an approach to fitting cox process models that reflects both the local spatial structure and spatial behavior at a larger spatial scale by using a constructed covariate together with spatial effects that account for spatial behavior at different spatial scales .",
    "this approach is assessed in a simulation study and we also discuss issues specific to this approach that arise when several spatial scales are accounted for in a model .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "the general methodology is introduced in section  [ sec2 ] . in section  [ constructcov ]",
    "we investigate the idea of mimicking local spatial behavior by using constructed covariates in a simulation study in the context of ( artificial ) data with known spatial structures and inspect patterns resulting from the fitted models .",
    "section  [ rainforest ] discusses a joint model of a large point pattern and two empirical covariates along with a constructed covariate and fits this to a rainforest data set .",
    "a hierarchical approach is considered in section  [ koalas ] , where both ( multiple ) marks and the underlying pattern are included in a joint model and fitted to a data set of eucalyptus trees and koalas foraging on these trees .",
    "[ sec2 ]      spatial point processes have been discussed in detail in the literature ; see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( @xcite ) and @xcite . here",
    "we aim at modeling a spatial point pattern @xmath0 , regarding it as a realization from a spatial point process @xmath1 .",
    "for simplicity we consider only point processes in @xmath2 , but the approaches can be generalized to point patterns in higher dimensions .",
    "we refer the reader to the literature for information on different ( classes of ) spatial point process models such as the simple poisson process , the standard null model of complete spatial randomness , as well as the rich class of gibbs ( or markov ) processes [ @xcite ] . here",
    ", we discuss the class of cox processes , in particular , log - gaussian cox processes .",
    "cox processes lend themselves well to modeling spatial point pattern data with spatially varying environmental conditions [ @xcite ] , as they model spatial patterns based on an underlying ( or latent ) random field @xmath3 that describes the random intensity , assuming independence given this field . in other words ,",
    "given the random field , the point pattern forms a poisson process .",
    "log - gaussian cox processes as considered , for example , in @xcite and @xcite ( @xcite ) , are a particularly flexible class , where @xmath4 has the form @xmath5 and @xmath6 is a gaussian random field , @xmath7 .",
    "other examples of cox processes include shot - noise cox processes [ @xcite ] .    here , we consider a general class of complex spatial point process models based on log - gaussian cox processes that allows the joint modeling of spatial patterns along with marks and covariates .",
    "we include both small and larger scale spatial behavior , using a constructed covariate and additional spatial effects .",
    "the resulting models can be regarded as latent gaussian models and , hence , inla can be used for parameter estimation and model fitting .",
    "cox processes are a special case of the very general class of _ latent gaussian models _ ,",
    "models of an outcome variable @xmath8 that assume independence conditional on some underlying latent field @xmath9 and hyperparameters @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite show that if @xmath9 has a sparse precision matrix and the number of hyperparameters is small ( i.e. , @xmath117 ) , inference based on inla is fast.=-1    the main aim of the inla approach is to approximate the posteriors of interest , that is , the marginal posteriors for the latent field @xmath12 and the marginal posteriors for the hyperparameters @xmath13 , and use these to calculate posterior means , variances , etc .",
    "these posteriors can be written as @xmath14 the nested formulation is used to compute @xmath15 by approximating @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and then to use numerical integration to integrate out @xmath18 .",
    "this is feasible , since the dimension of @xmath18 is small .",
    "similarly , @xmath19 is calculated by approximating @xmath17 and integrating out @xmath20 .",
    "the marginal posterior in equations ( [ posterior1 ] ) and ( [ posterior2 ] ) can be calculated using the laplace approximation @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the gaussian approximation to the full conditional of @xmath9 , and @xmath23 is the mode of the full conditional for @xmath9 , for a given @xmath18 .",
    "this makes sense , since the full conditional of a zero mean gauss markov random field can often be well approximated by a gaussian distribution by matching the mode and the curvature at the mode [ @xcite ] .",
    "further details are given in @xcite who show that the nested approach yields a very accurate approximation if applied to latent gaussian models .",
    "as a result , the time required for fitting these models is substantially reduced .",
    "[ lgc ]    the class of latent gaussian models comprises log - gaussian cox processes and , hence , the inla approach may be applied to fit these .",
    "specifically , the observation window is discretized into @xmath24 grid cells @xmath25 , each with area @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "the points in the pattern can then be described by @xmath28 with @xmath29 , where @xmath30 denotes the observed number of points in grid cell @xmath31 .",
    "we condition on the point pattern and , conditionally on @xmath32 , we have @xmath33 see @xcite .",
    "we model @xmath34 as @xmath35 where the functions @xmath36 are spatially structured effects that reflect large scale spatial variation in the pattern . these effects",
    "are modeled using a second - order random walk on a lattice , using vague gamma priors for the hyperparameter and constrained to sum to zero [ @xcite ] . in the models that we discuss below",
    ", the spatially structured effects relate to observed and unobserved spatial covariates as discussed in the examples in sections  [ rainforest ] and  [ sec5 ] .",
    "including spatial covariates directly in the model as fixed effects in addition to the random effects is straightforward . for simplicity",
    ", we omit these in equation ( [ general ] ) since this is not relevant in the specific data sets and models discussed below .",
    "@xmath37 denotes a spatially unstructured zero - mean gaussian i.i.d.error term , using a gamma prior for the precision .",
    "further , @xmath38 denotes a constructed covariate .",
    "constructed covariates are summary characteristics defined for any location in the observation window reflecting inter - individual spatial behavior such as local interaction or competition .",
    "we assume that this behavior operates at a smaller spatial scale than spatial aggregation due to ( observed or unobserved ) spatial covariates , and hence the spatially structured effects .",
    "the use of constructed covariates yields models with local spatial interaction within the flexible class of log - gaussian cox process models .",
    "it avoids issues with intractable normalizing constants that are common in the context of gibbs processes [ @xcite ] , since the covariates operate directly on the intensity of the pattern rather than on the density or the conditional intensity [ @xcite ] .",
    "the functional relationship between the outcome variable and the constructed covariate is typically not obvious and might often not be linear .",
    "we thus estimate this relationship explicitly by a smooth function @xmath39 and inspect this estimate to gain further information on the form of the spatial dependence .",
    "this function will be modeled as a first - order random walk , also constrained to sum to zero .    the constructed covariate considered in this paper",
    "is based on the nearest point distance , which is simple and fast to compute .",
    "specifically , for each center point of the grid cells we find the distance to the nearest point in the pattern outside this grid cell as @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the center point of cell @xmath31 and @xmath42 denotes the euclidean distance . defined this way , the constructed covariate can be used both to model local repulsion and local clustering .    during the modeling process",
    ", methods for model comparison based on the deviance information criterion ( dic ) [ @xcite ] may be used to compare different models with different levels of complexity .",
    "furthermore , both the ( estimated ) spatially structured field and the error field in ( [ general ] ) may be used to assess the model fit .",
    "the spatially structured effect may be used to reveal remaining spatial structure that is unexplained by the current model and the unstructured effects may be interpreted as a spatial residual .",
    "this provides a method for model assessment akin to residuals in , for example , linear models .",
    "this approach yields a toolbox for fitting , comparing and assessing realistically complex models of spatial point pattern data .",
    "we show that different types of flexible models can be fitted to point pattern data with complex structures using the inla approach within reasonable computation time .",
    "this includes joint models of large point patterns and covariates operating on a large spatial scale and local clustering ( section  [ rainforest ] ) as well as of a pattern with several dependent marks which also depend on the pattern ( section  [ koalas ] ) .      in the natural world",
    ", different mechanisms operate at different spatial scales [ @xcite ] , and hence are reflected in a spatial pattern at these scales .",
    "it is crucial to bear this in mind during the analysis of spatial data derived from nature , including spatial point pattern data",
    ". some mechanisms , such as seed dispersal in plants or territorial behavior in animals , may operate at a local spatial scale , while others , such as aggregation resulting from an association with certain environmental covariates , operate on the scale of the variation in these covariates , and hence often on a larger spatial scale .",
    "in addition , a spatial scale that is relevant in one application may not be relevant for a different data set .",
    "hence , the analysis of a spatial point pattern always involves a consideration of the appropriate spatial scales at which mechanisms of interest may operate , regardless of the concrete analysis methods . even as early as at the outset of a study ,",
    "when an appropriately sized observation window has to be chosen , relevant spatial scales operating in the system of interest have to be taken into consideration .    during the analysis the researcher has to carefully decide if variation at a specific scale constitutes noise or whether it reflects a true signal .",
    "it is hence crucial to be aware of which mechanisms operate at which spatial scales prior to any spatial data analysis .",
    "this may be done based on either background knowledge ( such as existing data on dispersal distances in plants or the sizes of home ranges in territorial animals ) or common sense .    in the models we discuss here , we explicitly take mechanisms operating at several different scales into account and have to choose these sensibly , based on knowledge of the systems .",
    "the spatially structured effect reflects spatial autocorrelation at a large spatial scale , whereas the constructed covariate is used to describe small scale inter - individual behavior .",
    "in addition , since we grid the data in this approach , the number of grid cells clearly determines the spatial resolution , especially at a small scale , and is clearly linked to computational costs and the extent to which information is lost through gridding the data . in the following ,",
    "we discuss issues related to each of these three parts of the models where spatial scale is relevant .    a spatially structured effect is typically included in a spatial model as a spatially structured error term , that is , in order to account for any spatial autocorrelation unexplained by covariates in the model .",
    "inla currently supports the 2nd order random walk on a lattice as a model for this , with a gamma prior for the variance of the spatially structured effect .",
    "the choice of this prior determines the smoothness of the spatial effect and through this , the spatial scale at which it operates .",
    "this prior has to be chosen carefully to avoid overfitting .",
    "this is particularly crucial in the context of spatial point patterns with relatively small numbers of points , where the gridded data are typically rather sparse [ @xcite ] .",
    "if the spatial effect is chosen to be too coarse , it explains the spatial variation at too small a scale , resulting in a coarse estimate of the spatially structured effect .",
    "this estimate would perfectly explain every single data point , resulting in overfitting rather than in a model of a generally interpretable trend .",
    "given the role of the spatially structured effect , it appears plausible to choose the prior so that the spatial effect operates at a similar spatial scale as the covariate .",
    "problems can occur when the spatially structured effect operates at a smaller scale than the covariate , as it is then likely to explain the data better than the covariates , rendering the model rather useless . in the absence of covariate data ,",
    "background knowledge on spatial scales may aid in choosing the prior .",
    "small scale inter - individual spatial behavior is modeled by the constructed covariate . as mentioned ,",
    "this is done to account for local spatial behavior if this is of specific interest in the application .",
    "again , there is a danger of overfitting , especially since the constructed covariate is estimated directly from the data .",
    "we discuss the practicality of using a spatial constructed covariate in detail in section  [ sec3 ] and only point out here that it has to be carefully chosen , if possible with appropriate knowledge of the specific system the data have been derived from .",
    "the choice of prior for the spatially structured effect is strongly related to the choice of grid size .",
    "however , in our experience the overall results often do not change substantially when the grid size was varied within reason . in applications ,",
    "the locations of the modeled objects as well as spatial covariates are sometimes given on a grid with a fixed resolution .",
    "we recommend using a grid that is not finer than that given by the data in the analysis .",
    "[ constructcov ]    in section  [ rainforest ] we use a constructed covariate primarily to incorporate local spatial structure into a model , while accounting for spatial variation at a larger spatial scale . to illustrate the use of the given constructed covariate and to assess the performance of the resulting models , we simulate point patterns from various classical point - process models .",
    "note , however , that we do not aim at explicitly estimating the parameters of these models but at assessing ( i ) whether known spatial structures may be detected through the use of the constructed covariate , as suggested here , and ( ii ) whether simulations from the fitted models generate patterns with similar characteristics . in the applications we have in mind , such as those discussed in the example in section  [ rainforest ] ,",
    "the data structure is typically more complicated .    for the purpose of this simulation study we consider three different situations : patterns with local repulsion ( section  [ repul ] ) , patterns with local clustering ( section  [ clust ] ) and patterns with local clustering in the presence of a larger - scale spatial trend ( section  [ clustinhom ] ) .",
    "we generate example patterns from different point process models with these properties on the unit square . for all simulation results",
    "this observation window has been discretized into a @xmath43 grid .    in sections  [ repul ] and  [ clust ]",
    "we initially assume that there is no large - scale spatial variation , with the aim of inspecting only the constructed covariate , and we consider @xmath44 using the notation in section  [ lgc ] . in section  [ clustinhom ]",
    "we consider both small- and large - scale spatial structures by including a spatially structured effect @xmath45 in addition to the constructed covariate @xmath38 and @xmath46    to evaluate a fitted model , we apply the metropolis algorithm [ @xcite ] to simulate patterns from these models and then compare characteristics of the simulated patterns with the generated example patterns . more specifically , for @xmath47 and @xmath48 , denote the joint distribution of @xmath49 given the latent field @xmath50 , by @xmath51 where the mean @xmath52 .",

    "[ fig4 ]      with the aim of assessing the performance of models with constructed covariates reflecting small scale inter - individual spatial behavior , we consider a number of simulated point patterns for three different scenarios : repulsion , clustering and small - scale clustering in the presence of large scale inhomogeneity . in all cases ,",
    "the local spatial structure can be clearly identified .",
    "the constructed covariate does not only take account of local spatial structures but also characterizes the spatial behavior .",
    "the functional form of the dependence of the intensity on the constructed covariate clearly reflects the character of the local behavior .",
    "this section presents only a small part of an extensive simulation study ; the results shown here are typical examples .",
    "we have run simulations from the same models as above with different sets of parameters and have obtained essentially the same results .",
    "further , fitting the model in equation ( [ simplemodel ] ) to patterns simulated from a homogeneous poisson process resulted in a nonsignificant functional relationship , that is , the modeling approach does not pick up spurious clustering or regularity .",
    "the approach allows us to fit models that take into account small - scale spatial behavior , regularity as well as clustering , in the context of log - gaussian cox processes , that is , as latent gaussian models . since these can be fitted using the inla approach , fitting is fast and exact .",
    "in addition , we avoid some of the typical problems that arise with gibbs process models , that is , we do not face issues of intractable normalizing constants , and regular as well as clustered patterns may be modeled .",
    "however , the simulations also show that the approach of using constructed covariates works clearly better with repulsive patterns than with clustered patterns .",
    "this is akin to similar issues with gibbs processes , where repulsive patterns are less problematic to model than clustered patterns .",
    "certainly , this is related to the fact that it is difficult to tell apart clustering from inhomogeneity [ @xcite ] .",
    "when working with constructed covariates the issues highlighted , that is , that local clustering may have been underestimated , have to be taken into account , especially in the interpretation of results .",
    "certainly , the constructed covariate in equation ( [ nearestn ] ) that we consider here is not the only possible choice .",
    "a covariate based on distance to the nearest point is likely to be rather `` short - sighted , '' so that other constructed covariates might be more suitable for detecting specific spatial structures . in particular , taking into account these limitations , it is not surprising that patterns simulated from models show less clustering than the original data .",
    "more general covariates such as the distance to the @xmath55th nearest point may be considered .",
    "other covariates , such as the local intensity or the number of points within a fixed interaction radius from a location @xmath79 , are certainly also suitable .",
    "a nice property of the given constructed covariate based on nearest - point distance is that it is parameter - free .",
    "for this reason , it is not necessary to choose explicitly the resolution of the local spatial behavior , for example , as an interaction radius .",
    "also , note that since the distance to the nearest point in point pattern @xmath80 for a location @xmath81 may be interpreted as a graph associated with @xmath82 , other constructed covariates based on different types of graphs [ @xcite ] may also be used as constructed covariates .",
    "similarly , an approach based on morphological functions may be used for this purpose .",
    "note that one could also consider constructed marks based on first or second order summary characteristics [ @xcite ] that are defined only for the points in the pattern and include these in the model .",
    "distinguishing spatial behavior at different spatial scales is clearly an ill - posed problem , since the behavior at one spatial scale is not independent of that at different spatial scales [ @xcite ] .",
    "the approach we take here will not always be able to distinguish clustering at different scales . however , different mechanisms that operate at very similar spatial scales are likely to be nonidentifiable by any method , irrespective of the choice of model or the constructed covariate",
    ". constructed covariates hence only provide useful results when the processes they are meant to describe operate at a spatial scale that is distinctly smaller than the larger scale processes in the same model .    admittedly , the use of constructed covariates is of a rather subjective and ad hoc nature .",
    "clearly , in applications the covariates have to be constructed carefully , depending on the questions of interest ; different types of constructed covariates may be suitable in different contexts .",
    "however , similarly subjective decisions are usually made when a model is fitted that is purely based on empirical covariates , as these have been specifically chosen as potentially influencing the outcome variable , based on background knowledge .",
    "in addition , due to the apparent danger of overfitting , constructed covariates should only be used if there is an interest in the local spatial behavior in a specific data set and if there is reason to believe that small- and large - scale spatial behavior are operating at scales that are different enough to make them identifiable .",
    "[ rainforest ]      in this example we consider a point pattern @xmath83 , where the number of points @xmath84 is potentially very large and several spatial covariates have been measured .",
    "the point pattern is assumed to depend on one or several ( observed or unobserved ) environmental covariates for which data @xmath85 exist . in the application that we have in mind the values of these have been observed in a few locations that are typically different from locations of the objects that form the pattern . in previous",
    "modeling attempts the values of the covariates in the locations of the objects are then either interpolated or modeled separately so that ( estimated ) values are used for locations were the covariates have not been observed .",
    "however , these covariates are likely to have been collected with both sampling and measurement error . in the specific case we consider here ( see section [ rainforestex ] ) they concern soil properties , which are measured much less reliably than the topography covariates in models such as those in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is less clear for soil variables than for topography covariates if these influence the presence of trees , or whether the presence of trees impacts on the soil variables . whereas models in which the soil variables are considered fixed and not modeled alongside the pattern , the model we deal with here does not make any assumption on the direction of this influence .    as a result",
    ", we suggest a joint model of the covariates along with the pattern that uses the original ( noninterpolated ) data on the covariates and accounts for measurement error .",
    "that is , we fit the model in equation ( [ general ] ) to @xmath80 and jointly fit a model to the covariates . the pattern and the covariates",
    "are linked by joint spatial fields .",
    "an additional spatially structured effect is used to detect any remaining spatial structures in the pattern that can not be explained by the joint fields with the covariates .    in the case of",
    "@xmath86 we fit the following model , where the pattern is modeled as @xmath87 and the covariates as @xmath88 and @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the observed covariates in grid cells where the covariates have been measured and missing where they have not been measured .",
    "@xmath92 represents the function of the constructed covariate ( [ nearestn ] ) .",
    "@xmath93 and @xmath94 are spatially structured effects , that is , reflect a random field for each of the covariates and @xmath95 reflects spatial autocorrelation in the pattern unexplained by the covariates ; @xmath37 and @xmath96 are spatially unstructured fields used to account for measurement or sampling error .",
    "in addition to the spatial effect reflecting the empirical covariates , which are likely to have an impact on the larger scale spatial behavior , we use the constructed covariate to account for local clustering . in the application",
    "we have in mind ( see section  [ rainforestex ] ) this clustering is a result of seed - dispersal mechanisms operating on a much smaller spatial scale than that of the aggregation of individuals due to an association with environmental covariates .",
    "[ rainforestex ]      some extraordinarily detailed multi - species maps are being collected in tropical forests as part of an international effort to gain greater understanding of these ecosystems [ @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "these data comprise the locations of all trees with diameters at breast height ( dbh ) 1 cm or greater , a measure of the size of the trees ( dbh ) , and the species identity of the trees . the data usually",
    "amount to several hundred thousand trees in large ( 25 ha or 50 ha ) plots that have not been subject to any sustained disturbance such as logging .",
    "the spatial distribution of these trees is likely to be determined by both spatially varying environmental conditions and local dispersal .",
    "recently , spatial point process methodology has been applied to analyze some of these data sets [ @xcite ; @xcite ] using nonparametric descriptive methods as well as explicit models [ @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "@xcite model the spatial pattern formed by a tropical rain forest tree species on the underlying environmental conditions and use the inla approach to fit the model .",
    "we analyze a data set that is similar to those discussed in the above references .",
    "since the spatial structure in a forest reflects dispersal mechanisms as well as association with environmental conditions , we include a constructed covariate to account for local clustering .",
    "the model is fitted to a data set from a 50 ha forest dynamics plot at pasoh forest reserve , peninsular malaysia .",
    "this study focuses on the species _ aporusa microstachya _ consisting of 7416 individuals [ figure  [ patternrain](a ) ] .",
    "the environmental covariates have been observed in 83 locations that are distinct from the locations of the trees [ figure  [ patternrain](b ) ] .",
    "the plot lies in a forest that has never been logged with very narrow streams on almost flat land .",
    "the data collected in 1995 are used here when the plot contained 320903 stems from 817 species .",
    "the species is the most common small tree on the plot .",
    "it is of interest if this species , as an aluminium accumulator , covaries with magnesium availability , as aluminium uptake might constrain its capacity to take up nutrient cations such as magnesium .",
    "in addition , its covariation with phosphorus is considered here as the element thought to be the nutrient primarily limiting forest productivity and individual tree growth in tropical forests [ burslem , personal communication ( february 2011 ) ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the estimated common spatial effect [ figure  [ koalaresnew](a ) ] represents spatial autocorrelation present in the pattern and the marks which might be the result of related environmental processes such as nutrient levels in the soil .",
    "the estimated parameter value for @xmath97 and @xmath98 have opposite signs ( table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "the negative sign for @xmath99 indicates that palatability is low where the trees are aggregated , which might have been caused by competition for soil nutrients in these areas .",
    "the positive sign for @xmath98 reflects that the koalas are more likely to be present in areas with higher intensity .",
    "recalling that the data have been accumulated over time , this might be due to the koalas being more likely to change from one tree to a neighboring tree where the trees are aggregated .",
    "the mean of the posterior density for the parameter @xmath100 in the final model is 1.38 , indicating a significant positive influence of palatability on the frequency of koala visits to the trees .",
    "the three unstructured terms are given in figures  [ koalaresnew](b)(d ) .",
    "a slight trend in the residuals for the leaf marks may be observed in figure  [ koalaresnew](c ) , with lower values toward the bottom left probably reflecting an inhomogeneity that can not be accounted for by the joint spatial effect @xmath45 .",
    "the example considered in this section is a marked cox process model , that is , a model of both the spatial pattern and two types of dependent marks , providing information on the spatial pattern at the same time as on the marks and their dependence . in cases where the marks are of primary scientific interest",
    ", one could view this approach as a model of the marks which implicitly takes the spatial dependence into account by modeling it alongside the marks .",
    "the model we use here is similar to approaches taken in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "since our approach is very flexible , it can easily be generalized to allow for separate spatially structured effects for the pattern and the marks and to include additional empirical covariates ; these have not been available here .",
    "hence , using the approach considered here , we are able to fit easily a complex spatial point process model to a marked point pattern and to assess its suitability for a specific data set .    marked point pattern data sets where data on marks are likely to depend on an underlying spatial pattern are not uncommon .",
    "within ecology , for instance , metapopulation data [ @xcite ] typically consist of the locations of subpopulations and their properties , and have a similar structure to the data set considered here .",
    "these data sets may be modeled using a similar approach and it is straightforward to fit related but more complex models , including empirical covariates or temporal replicates .",
    "similarly , marks are available for the rainforest data discussed in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "as mentioned there , a model that includes the marks of the trees may also be fitted using the approach discussed here .",
    "researchers outside the statistical community have become familiar with fitting a large range of different models to complex data sets using software available in ` r ` .",
    "this paper provides a very flexible framework for routinely fitting models to complex spatial point pattern data with little computational effort using models that account for both local and global spatial behavior .",
    "we consider complex data examples and demonstrate how marks as well as covariates can be included in a joint model .",
    "that is , we consider a situation where the marks and the covariates can be modeled along with the pattern and show that it is computationally feasible to do so",
    ". we can take account of local spatial structure by using a constructed covariate , which we discuss in detail in section [ constructcov ] .",
    "the two models discussed here indicate that our approach can be applied in a wide range of situations and is flexible enough to facilitate the fitting of other even more complex models .",
    "it is feasible to fit several related models to realistically complex data sets if necessary , and to use the dic to aid the choice of covariates .",
    "the posterior distributions of the estimated parameters can be used to assess the significance of the influence of different covariates in the models . through the use of a structured spatial effect and an unstructured spatial effect it is possible to assess the quality of the model fit .",
    "specifically , the structured spatial effect can be used to reveal spatial correlations in the data that have not been explained with the covariates and may help researchers identify suitable covariates to incorporate into the model .",
    "spatially unstructured effects may be used to account for and identify extreme observations such as locations where covariate values have been collected with a particularly strong measurement error .    there is an extensive literature on descriptive and nonparametric approaches to the analysis of spatial point patterns , specifically on ( functional ) summary characteristics describing first and second order spatial behavior , in particular , on ripley s @xmath101-function [ @xcite ] and the pair correlation function [ @xcite ] . in both the statistical and the applied literature these",
    "have been discussed far more frequently than likelihood based modeling approaches , and provide an elegant means for characterizing the properties of spatial patterns [ illian et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ] .",
    "a  thorough analysis of a spatial point pattern typically includes an extensive exploratory analysis and in many cases it may even seem unnecessary to continue the analysis and fit a spatial point process model to a pattern . an exploratory analysis based on functional summary characteristics , such as ripley s @xmath101-function or the pair - correlation function , considers spatial behavior at a multitude of spatial scales , making this approach particularly appealing .",
    "however , with increasing complexity of the data , it becomes less obvious how suitable summary characteristics should be defined for these , and a point process model may be a suitable alternative .",
    "for example , it is not obvious how one would jointly analyze the two different marks together with the pattern in the koala data set based on summary characteristics .",
    "however , as discussed in section  [ koalas ] , it is straightforward to do this with a hierarchical model .",
    "in addition , most exploratory analysis tools assume the process to be first - order stationary or at least second - order reweighted stationary [ baddeley et al .",
    "( @xcite)]a situation that is both rare and difficult to assess in applications , in particular , in the context of realistic and complex data sets .",
    "the approach discussed here does not make any assumptions about stationarity but explicitly includes spatial trends into the model .    in the literature , local spatial behavior",
    "has often been modelled by a gibbs process .",
    "large - scale spatial behavior may be incorporated into a gibbs process model as a parametric or nonparametric , yet deterministic , trend , while it is treated as a stochastic process in itself here .",
    "modeling the spatial trend in a gibbs process hence often assumes that an explicit and deterministic model of the trend as a function of location ( and spatial covariates ) is known [ @xcite ] . even in the nonparametric situation ,",
    "the estimated values of the underlying spatial trend are considered fixed values , which are subject neither to stochastic variation nor to measurement error .",
    "since it is based on a latent random field , the approach discussed here differs substantially from the gibbs process approach and assumes a hierarchical , doubly stochastic structure .",
    "this very flexible class of point processes provides models of local spatial behavior relative to an underlying large - scale spatial trend . in realistic applications",
    "this spatial trend is not known .",
    "values of the covariates that are continuous in space are typically not known everywhere and have been interpolated .",
    "it is likely that spatial trends exist in the data that can not be accounted for by the covariates .",
    "the spatial trend is hence not regarded as deterministic but assumed to be a random field .",
    "this approach allows to jointly model the covariate and the spatial pattern as in the model used for the rainforest example data set . clearly , unlike gibbs processes , log gaussian cox processes",
    "do not allow second order inter - individual interactions to be included in a model .",
    "in a situation where these are of primary interest , cox processes are certainly not suitable .    in order to make model fitting feasible ,",
    "the continuous gaussian random field is approximated here by a discrete gauss markov random field . while this is computationally elegant",
    ", one might argue that this approximation is not justified and is too coarse , resulting in an unnecessary loss of information .",
    "clearly , since any model only has a finite representation in a computer , model fitting approaches often work with some degree of discretization . however , and more importantly , @xcite",
    "show that there is an explicit link between a large class of covariance functions ( and hence the gaussian random field based on these ) and gauss markov random fields , clearly pointing out that the approximation is indeed justified .",
    "in addition , based on the results discussed in @xcite , the approaches taken in this paper may be extended to avoid the computationally wasteful need of having to use a regular grid [ @xcite ] .",
    "@xcite also mention the issue of complex boundaries structures that are particularly relevant for point process data sets where the observation window has been chosen to align with natural boundaries that may impact on pattern . while this is clearly not an issue for the rainforest data set since the boundaries have been chosen arbitrarily , the koala data set , however , has been observed in an observation window surrounded by a koala proof fence .",
    "this fence does probably not impact on the locations of the trees nor the leaf chemistry but might increase the frequency of koala visits near the fence .",
    "the approach in @xcite may be used to define varying boundary conditions for different parts of the data set , and hence allow for more realistic modeling for data sets with complicated boundary structures .    in summary ,",
    "the methodology discussed here , together with the ` r ` library ` r - inla ` ( http://www.r-inla.org/ ) , makes complex spatial point process models accessible to scientists outside the statistical sciences and provides them with a toolbox for routinely fitting and assessing the fit of suitable and realistic point process models to complex spatial point pattern data .",
