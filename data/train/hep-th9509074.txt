    "string theory is the most promising candidate for the unification of gravity with the other fundamental forces of nature .",
    "however , string theory is most likely to cause significant modifications to classical general relativity near the planck scale , which is far beyond the range of direct terrestrial experimentation . since these energy scales are typically associated with the big bang it is natural to view cosmology as a laboratory for testing string theoretic modifications to gravity .",
    "conversely , cosmologists can hope that if string theory does provide a deeper understanding of gravitational physics than general relativity then some of the `` standard '' problems of conventional cosmology will be resolved by string theory .",
    "consequently , the cosmological dynamics of superstring theories are the subject of intense scrutiny",
    ". typically , one proceeds by perturbatively expanding the full superstring theory and extracting a `` low energy '' lagrangian that contains einstein gravity and the lowest order corrections from string theory . for this approach to be valid we need to restrict our attention to sub - planckian scales where quantum effects can be ignored and the higher order terms in the perturbative expansion do not contribute significantly .",
    "we consider the tree - level action @xcite which contains contributions from the metric , the dilaton , the central charge and an antisymmetric tensor field .",
    "we assume that the background spacetime is four dimensional and that it , and the fields defined upon it , are homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "further , we assume that degrees of freedom associated with any compactified metric can be ignored .",
    "such cosmologies have received considerable study , @xcite , with particular attention being paid to the effect of the dilaton field and its self - interaction potential .",
    "however , the roles of the antisymmetric tensor field and the spatial curvature of the metric have often been neglected .",
    "copeland , lahiri and wands  @xcite give the general analytic solutions to the equations of motion for the antisymmetric tensor field in a background with non - zero spatial curvature , for the case when the central charge is zero .",
    "in this paper we consider this system with the a non - zero central charge .",
    "previously , tseytlin @xcite has given several exact solutions .",
    "also goldwirth and perry  @xcite use a phase - plane analysis to describe the cosmological properties of solutions to the equations of motion of models with a non - zero central charge in a flat flrw background .",
    "many previous authors have exploited the equivalence of the action written in terms of conformally related metrics . in this paper",
    "we show that there is an additional , formal , equivalence between the equations of motion for our homogeneous fields in _ spatially curved _ flrw metrics and those of a scalar field minimally coupled to einstein gravity in a _ spatially flat _",
    "flrw metric .",
    "we refer to this system as the shifted flrw frame , and use it to succinctly describe the full range of cosmological evolution that is possible within this model .",
    "as the name suggests , it is based on the shifted dilaton field  @xcite .",
    "while we can not give an analytic solution to the equations of motion for the general case when the central charge is non - zero , we do find an exact result for a particular choice of parameters .",
    "we take as our starting point the tree - level action @xcite @xmath0   ,    \\label{dimdaction}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the graviton , @xmath2",
    "the dilaton , @xmath3}$ ] is the antisymmetric tensor field where lower case roman indices run from @xmath4 to @xmath5 and the central charge deficit is denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "henceforth we will assume that this @xmath7-dimensional theory has undergone compactification , leaving only four macroscopic dimensions , and that the terms corresponding to degrees of freedom on the compact metric are held fixed .",
    "the real world may be more complicated , but , in the absence of compelling reasons for choosing any particular compactification scheme , this simplification will allow us to examine the dynamics due solely to the degrees of freedom associated with the macroscopic dimensions .",
    "this allows us to reduce the action to @xmath8    , \\label{dim4action1}\\ ] ] where the spacetime manifold is now four dimensional .",

    "furthermore , since the lagrangian does not depend on @xmath15 , the corresponding momentum , @xmath17 is conserved and @xmath18 is a constant . finally , by adding the total derivative , @xmath19 to the integrand , we obtain @xmath20}.   \\label{saction3}\\ ] ]    the action is now has a simpler form , but notice that it includes the crossed kinetic term @xmath21 .",

    ", it is possible to further simplify the system by choosing alternative variables which have orthogonal kinetic terms and respect the symmetry of the potential .",
    "while we can simplify the kinetic terms by converting to the einstein frame , we do so at the cost of introducing a more complicated potential .",
    "we now introduce a choice of variables that combines the advantages both of the string frame ( separable potential ) and the einstein frame ( no crossed kinetic terms ) .",

    "it is related to the proper time in the einstein frame , @xmath27 , by @xmath42    we will refer to this choice of variables as the shifted frame because , apart from a numerical factor , @xmath32 coincides with the shifted dilaton previously used  @xcite to simplify the equations of motion .",
    "our scalar field is actually the logarithm of scale factor in the string frame , @xmath43 , and the shifted scale factor @xmath39 represents the variation of the fields in the orthogonal direction .",
    "the shifted dilaton , or equivalently @xmath32 , reflects the symmetries of the underlying string theory better than the `` renormalized '' field @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "for instance , it remains invariant under the scale - factor duality transformation @xmath44 .",
    "however , our action is only invariant under this transformation if @xmath45 , which requires both the spatial curvature and antisymmetric tensor field to vanish .",
    "this change of variables is not a conformal transformation , which is an identity between two actions for all field configurations , as the shifted frame only exists for homogeneous fields .",
    "also there is no equivalent choice of variables if we include loop - corrections to the dilaton coupling .",
    "however , if we are going to restrict our attention to the tree - level action which contains only the dilaton , antisymmetric tensor and central charge terms with a homogeneous and isotropic string metric , then working in the shifted frame allows us to write this system in a particularly simple form .",
    "the practical advantage of working in this shifted frame is that the spatial curvature of the string metric , @xmath46 , appears as a term in the potential @xmath37 , and the shifted flrw metric is always spatially flat .",
    "the dynamical system in the shifted frame is thus the basis of almost all inflationary models and its properties are familiar and well understood .",
    "moreover we will see in the next section that it is particularly simple to identify the @xmath47 or @xmath48 branches of pre - big - bang string cosmology  @xcite with the contracting or expanding scale factor in the shifted frame .",
    "the qualitative dynamics of our system are strongly influenced by whether or not the values of @xmath18 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 permit the inequality @xmath51 to be satisfied .",
    "if @xmath52 , then @xmath53 for sufficiently large values of @xmath33 but when @xmath54 , a negative potential region can only exist if @xmath55 .",
    "then ( for @xmath56 ) @xmath37 has its minimum value when @xmath57 , which is negative if @xmath58 ( see fig .  ( 1 ) ) .",
    "thus the negative potential region exists when one of the following is true : @xmath59 in the next section we use the formalism of the shifted frame to discuss exact solutions to the equations of motion .",
    "analytic solutions are known to exist when any one of the three terms in @xmath37 is non - zero , and we show that these can be simply expressed in the shifted frame .",
    "secondly , we employ techniques developed for obtaining exact scalar field cosmologies to derive a new particular solution where all three terms in the potential are non - zero . in section 5",
    "we then utilize these exact solutions as limiting cases of the solutions to the equations of motion to catalog all the different possible types of cosmological behavior this model can produce .",
    "exact solutions to the system of eqs .",
    "( [ shift.constraint ] ) to  ( [ ddpsi ] ) for specific potentials have been analyzed by a number of authors . clearly , the only solutions of relevant to the system considered here are those where the potential takes the form of eq .",

    "eventually the energy density in the shifted frame ( kinetic plus potential energy of @xmath33 ) reaches zero , leading to a turning point for @xmath132 . in the contracting phase the energy density increases .",
    "the presence of the antisymmetric tensor field will ensure that @xmath33 is always reflected back from large negative values towards the minimum of the potential .",

    ". only exceptional cases , for which we have analytic solutions , have an infinite lifetime in the string frame",
    ". however , the dilaton always diverges at early and/or late times , taking the solution into the strong coupling regime .    in the string or einstein frames",
    "the solutions exhibit a diverse range of behavior , depending on both the curvature of the spatial hypersurfaces of the background spacetime ( described by @xmath50 ) and the other parameter values , @xmath49 and @xmath18 .",
    "as long as the antisymmetric tensor field is non - zero , the string frame scale factor is always bounded from below @xcite .    for all values of @xmath50 , including the case with positive curvature when @xmath162 , there are choices of the parameter values for which the einstein frame scale factor expands indefinitely from an initial singularity . if @xmath102 and @xmath163 the einstein frame scale factor can pass through several local maxima and minima , but the lifetime of the universe is finite . if @xmath88 , then the einstein frame scale factor always has a finite maximum value , irrespective of the values of @xmath50 and @xmath18 .",
    "each term in the action we have considered turns out to play an important role at different stages in the cosmological evolution .",
    "consequently , we have found new types of behavior not seen in previous studies which omit one or more of the terms . by the same token , our own conclusions may be sensitive to the inclusion of further terms in the action .",
    "nonetheless , the absence of solutions which interpolate between weak coupling regimes rules out the possibility of successfully implementing the pre - big bang scenario  @xcite in our system .",
    "this complements the work of kaloper , madden and olive  @xcite who reach similar conclusions considering the effect of an explicit potential for the dilaton and loop corrections to the dilaton coupling , but without an antisymmetric tensor field or spatial curvature .",
    "all possible solutions to our equations of motion contain phases where the coupling becomes strong .",
    "therefore this tree - level limit of the full string theory predicts its own downfall , where higher - order corrections can not be neglected .",
