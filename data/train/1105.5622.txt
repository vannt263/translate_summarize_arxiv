    "the transition from a localized to an itinerant electron picture has been thoroughly studied in the last decades.@xcite in particular , 3d electron systems can be described by both pictures , depending on the situation , structure , u / w ratio ( on - site coulomb repulsion vs. bandwidth ) , pressure , strain , etc.@xcite metal - insulator transitions ( mit ) have been observed in these compounds induced by pressure,@xcite chemical pressure,@xcite change in structure,@xcite temperature,@xcite spatial confinement,@xcite or a simple change in electron count.@xcite    charge ordering ( co ) plays an important role in the insulating side of these mit in various transition metal oxides , happening both in bulk compounds such as perovskite manganites  @xcite and nickelates  @xcite , and in nanostructures.@xcite when materials approach a mit , the lattice can become softer due to bond - length fluctuations,@xcite and this could lead to structural distortions or phase transitions of peculiar character.@xcite    v@xmath4o@xmath5 is a member of the homologous series v@xmath6o@xmath7= v@xmath8o@xmath9 + ( n-2)vo@xmath8 ( 3@xmath10 n @xmath109 ) , known as magnli phase compounds.@xcite the structure of the members of this series is based on the rutile unit cell .",
    "vo@xmath11 , like several other transition metal dioxides , crystallyzes ( above room temperature ) in the rutile structure,@xcite characterized by an octahedral coordination of the v cations by o atoms and a strong metal - metal bonding along the c - direction .",
    "the crystal structure of v@xmath0o@xmath1 ( ref . ) consists of rutile - like blocks that are infinite in two - dimensions and four vo@xmath12 octahedra wide in the third ( see fig . [ structures ] ) .",
    "the shear planes between the rutile blocks have the typical local structure for v@xmath11o@xmath13 ( ref . ) .",
    "the resulting structure is triclinic , belonging to a @xmath14 space group , with four and seven independent v and o sites , respectively .",
    "the v sites are split into two groups : v3 and v4 , which are at the shear plane , and v1 and v2 , at the center of the rutile blocks . since v3 and v4 octahedra",
    "are connected by face sharing , their environment is sesquioxide - like whereas that of v1 and v2 is rutile - like .",
    "the cations form two independent chains v3-v1-v1-v3 and v4-v2-v2-v4 running parallel to the pseudorutile c - axis ( see fig .",
    "[ structures ] ) .",
    "various members of the series are characterized by a mit.@xcite the physics of the transition in vo@xmath11 has been strongly debated .",
    "this is a correlated compound , but the occurrence of a dimerization along the c - direction , leading to a formation of spin - singlets due to the peierls distortion , shows that both correlations and peierls physics play a role in causing the transition.@xcite v@xmath0o@xmath1 shows a mit at 250 k ( t@xmath15).@xcite the mit in v@xmath4o@xmath5 is a weakly first order one.@xcite in this case , the lattice symmetry is unchanged during the phase transition unlike the cases of v@xmath8o@xmath9 and vo@xmath8 .",
    "the compound also exhibits a paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic ( afm ) transition at t@xmath16@xmath17 40 k.@xcite the fact that the mit occurs at a different temperature than the magnetic one allows to think that the magnetic order is not a driving force of the phase transition .",
    "a simple electron count in v@xmath4o@xmath5 gives an average valence v@xmath18 for the metal cations .",
    "hence , 2v@xmath2(d@xmath19 ) and 2v@xmath3(d@xmath20 ) per formula unit could be expected if co would occur .",
    "different previous works showed that the metallic state was characterized by an almost complete disorder of the v@xmath2 and v@xmath3 cations whereas the insulating state showed a high degree of ordering:@xcite the v3-v1-v1-v3 chain is formed by v@xmath3 ions and the v4-v2-v2-v4 by v@xmath2 ones .",
    "to summarize , co in the cation sites occurs below the transition , and this co state eventually orders magnetically at lower temperatures .",
    "other works point out that the magnetic moments are localized not only in the insulating phase but to some degree also in the metallic one.@xcite most studies show that , in addition to electron localization , half of the v@xmath3 and all v@xmath2 cations are paired , forming short v - v bonds along their corresponding chains in the insulating state.@xcite another feature of the structural changes occuring at the mit is the ferro- or antiferroelectric - like shift of unpaired v@xmath3 ions at the shear planes , from the center of o@xmath12 octahedra towards one of the surrounding oxygens .",
    "such distortion ( `` twisting '' ) also occurs in vo@xmath11.@xcite    several questions arise when looking at these results .",
    "the first is , what is the nature of v pairing in the insulating phase ?",
    "similar pairing in vo@xmath11 is largely connected with the orbital repopulation:@xcite d - electrons , which in the metallic phase above t@xmath15 were more or less equally distributed over all the t@xmath21-orbitals , below t@xmath15 occupy predominantly one orbital ( d@xmath22 in the local coordinate system ) , with the lobes in the c - direction , giving strong overlap with neighboring v s along the chains in the c - axis .",
    "the resulting one - dimensional electron system is unstable with respect to peierls , or spin - peierls dimerization , leading to the formation of singlet v@xmath3-v@xmath3 dimers .",
    "there exist many other compounds with transition metal ions with configuration d@xmath20 ( containing v@xmath3 , ti@xmath2 , or nb@xmath3 ) which also form singlet dimers at low temperatures .",
    "thus , we could think that a similar phenomenon could exist also in v@xmath0o@xmath1 , at least for the v@xmath3 chains v3-v1-v1-v3 .",
    "but , in fact , in these segments only the two middle v s ( v1-v1 ) form singlet dimers , with v3 ions remaining unpaired and apparently magnetic .",
    "the question is why is this so .    on the other hand , all the v@xmath2 in v@xmath0o@xmath1 form dimers , which is not very typical for v@xmath2 cations ( d@xmath19 , s=1 ) : only very few compounds with v@xmath2 form dimers .",
    "this happens for example in znv@xmath11o@xmath0,@xcite but in this case the short v - v dimers are not in a singlet state , but are `` ferromagnetic '' ( fm ) , i.e. have parallel spins on two v s . what is the character of v@xmath2 dimers in v@xmath0o@xmath1 , and why these dimers are formed , is an open question .",
    "another problem is the character and the mechanism of magnetic ordering in v@xmath0o@xmath1 below t@xmath16 = 40 k. despite long history of study of v@xmath0o@xmath1 , its magnetic structure is actually not known .",
    "it is also not clear which v ions participate in the magnetic ordering .",
    "apparently , the paired v@xmath3 ions ( v1-v1 ) are in a singlet state and `` drop out of the game '' . if v@xmath2 pairs would also be singlet , then only 1/4 of all the v s , the unpaired v@xmath3 in v3 position , would be magnetic .",
    "but then it would be difficult to understand why such a `` dilute '' magnetic system , with magnetic ions with small spin s= 1/2 and located far from each other , would give a reasonably high value of the nel temperature of @xmath17 40 k. alternatively , it is possible that the spins of the v@xmath2 ions are not completely quenched , and that these ions also contribute to magnetic ordering .    in order to shed light on the issues of charge and magnetic order and on the nature of the observed structural distortions , to analyze what degree of charge disproportionation exists in both phases and also what is the nature and strength of each of the magnetic couplings , we have studied the electronic structure of both metallic and insulating phases of v@xmath4o@xmath5 by means of _ ab initio _",
    "calculations.@xcite besides co , we have obtained the specific orbital ordering ( oo ) in the insulating phase , which allows to explain the distortion pattern observed in it .",
    "we have also analyzed the plausible magnetic configurations and have discussed the magnetic properties of both low and high - temperature phases .",
    "our electronic structure calculations have been performed with the wien2k code,@xcite based on density functional theory@xcite ( dft ) utilizing the augmented plane wave plus local orbitals method ( apw+lo).@xcite we have used the lda+u @xcite approach including self - interaction corrections in the so - called `` fully localized limit '' with the on - site coulomb repulsion u= 4.1 ev and the on - site hund s rule coupling j= 0.7 ev .",
    "this method improves over the generalized gradient approximation@xcite ( gga ) or local density approximation ( lda)@xcite in the study of systems containing correlated electrons by introducing the on - site coulomb repulsion u. results presented here are consistent for values of u in the interval from about 3 to 5 ev , a reasonable range according to previous similar calculations of v@xmath3 compounds@xcite and also of v@xmath2 compounds.@xcite the calculations were fully converged with respect to the k - mesh and r@xmath23k@xmath24 .",
    "values used for the k - mesh were 5@xmath254@xmath254 sampling of the full brillouin zone .",
    "r@xmath23k@xmath24= 6.0 was chosen for all the calculations .",
    "selected muffin tin radii were the following : 1.72 a.u . for v , and 1.53 a.u . for o in the low - t structure and in the high - t phase , 1.77 a.u . for v , and 1.57 a.u",
    "we have taken the structural data for both the metallic phase ( at 298 k ) and the insulating one ( at 120 k ) from the work of hodeau and marezio.@xcite the main structural features are depicted in fig .",
    "[ structures ] .",
    "the two phases comprise different v - v and v - o distances ( the v - v distances are shown in fig .",
    "[ structures](d ) , the v - o distances are presented in table [ distancias_v_o ] ) . as can be seen , in the v4-v2-v2-v4 chain of the metallic phase , the cations are equidistant . in the insulating state , the v2-v4 distance becomes shorter than the v2-v2 one , favoring a possible v2-v4 pairing .",
    "even larger change occurs in the v3-v1-v1-v3 chain distances from the high to the low temperature structure , with the v1-v1 distance becoming much shorter at lower temperatures .",
    "the distance between chains remains almost unchanged across the mit .",
    ".interatomic distances between v and o atoms ( in  ) in v@xmath0o@xmath1 for both the low - temperature ( 120 k ) and high - temperature ( 298 k ) phases .",
    "structural data are taken from ref . .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     according to the analysis performed in ref . by doing bond - length summations with the experimental structural data , the high temperature metallic state is not comprised of completely disordered v@xmath2 , v@xmath3 cations .",
    "the 4224 chains contain around a 58@xmath26 of the v@xmath2 cations whereas the 3113 chains contain the same amount of the v@xmath3 ones .",
    "hence , in each chain , even in the metallic state , there remains some charge segregation , but a rather weak one . in the insulating phase ,",
    "the 4224 chains become richer in 3 + cations ( about 83@xmath26 ) , v2 having a valence of 3.24 + , and v4 a valence of 3.09 + . meanwhile",
    ", the 3113 chain has 83@xmath26 of the v@xmath3 cations , each of them having a valence of 3.83 + .",
    "thus , the low - temperature insulating state is characterized by the ordering of the v@xmath2 and v@xmath3 cations over the four cation sites and by the pairing of half of the v@xmath3 ( those in v1 positions ) , and of all the v@xmath2 in the short v - v bonds along the corresponding chains .",
    "the remaining unpaired v@xmath3 ions ( v3 ) , on the other hand , shift from the centers of the corresponding o@xmath12 octahedra , forming one very short v  o bond ( v3o3 ) of less than 1.8  , as can be seen in table [ distancias_v_o ] .    o@xmath1 .",
    "the lines represent the shear planes .",
    "we also show the magnetic structure of the low - temperature phase obtained for u= 4.1 ev ( the coupling accross the shear planes becomes afm for u @xmath27 ev ) .",

    "]        the electronic structure of the low - temperature phase of v@xmath0o@xmath1 can be roughly understood by analyzing the short - long v - v bonds alternating in the structure .",
    "these , in particular , modify the magnetic couplings , and also the distinct charge and orbital states for the v cations that such a structure might lead to . in order to analyze the electronic structure of the compound",
    ", we have performed lda+u calculations for several values of u ( 3.4 - 5.4 ev ) .",
    "for all the u values , the most stable solutions have in - chain antiferromagnetic ( afm ) couplings . by increasing the u value , the inter - chain coupling ,",
    "even though always almost negligible in value , switches from fm for lower u values to afm for u @xmath27 ev . the magnetic ground - state ( consistent with the in - chain couplings for u ranging from 3.4 to 5.4 ev ) can be seen in figs .",

    "a band structure plot is often a more reliable tool to analyze charge states in localized electron systems than a simple electron count inside the muffin - tin spheres.@xcite the total charge in both cases would be very similar , causing the very small difference in total energy observed experimentally , but the electronic structure and magnetic moments can be very different .",
    "this phase is an insulating one with a d - d gap of about 0.6 ev , for this particular value of u ( 4.1 ev ) .",

    "the dos integrations inside the muffin - tin spheres give a less distinct picture of the co phenomenon than the band structures , which are much clearer .    in order to give further evidence of the large co character of the low - temperature phase",

    "the spin density of the v@xmath2(d@xmath19 ) cations corresponds to that of a mixture of d@xmath32 and d@xmath33 orbitals , whereas for the v@xmath3(d@xmath20 ) it can be interpreted as a d@xmath22 orbital , using a local coordinate system with the z - axis directed from v towards its apical oxygen .    in principle",
    ", one would expect the local octahedral environments of the v@xmath3 and v@xmath2 cations to be distorted accordingly , to accomodate one electron in the d@xmath22 singlet or two in the d@xmath32 , d@xmath33 doublet .",
    "the distances we have summarized in table [ distancias_v_o ] suggest complicated distortions of the vo@xmath12 octahedra , which make it difficult to predict on the basis of only local distortions which orbitals would be occupied,@xcite without analyzing the results of the calculations .    on the basis of these results",
    ", one can suggest a possible explanation of the origin of the structural distortions found in v@xmath0o@xmath1 below t@xmath15 .",
    "v@xmath3 ions occupy two types of positions : v1 in the middle of rutile - like chains , and v3 at the shear plane .",
    "when one electron occupies the d@xmath22 orbital in v@xmath3 atoms , which occurs below t@xmath15 , there exists strong direct overlap of these orbitals along the chain , which can give rise to a metal - metal bonding of v1 ions , like that in the singlet dimers in the insulating phase of vo@xmath11.@xcite however , the v@xmath3 ions in v3 positions are in a different situation : they have a common face with v4 across the shear plane .",
    "in this situation , as argued by goodenough,@xcite the main instability of these ions would be the shift of such v@xmath3 from the center of its o@xmath12 octahedron ( ferro- or antiferroelectric distortion ) .",
    "indeed , as one sees from the table [ distancias_v_o ] , just for this v there exists one very short v - o distance , v3-o3 , of 1.73  ; all the other v - o distances are larger and more or less equal .",
    "thus , in the structure of v@xmath0o@xmath1 , with shear planes every four sites and with the obtained charge and oo , we would have an ( anti)ferroelectric - type displacement of the `` edge '' v3 ions , but the `` inner '' v@xmath3 ions v1 would form short , presumably singlet ( see below ) dimers .",
    "the situation here resembles somewhat the m2 phase of vo@xmath11,@xcite in which also half of v@xmath3 ions form singlet dimers , but the other half has no dimerization , but has instead an antiferroelectric - type distortion ( `` twisting '' ) with the formation of one short v - o bond .",
    "the oo in v@xmath2 ions , obtained in our calculations , is , however , quite different from that in v@xmath3 cations : in v@xmath2 not d@xmath22 , but rather two other orbitals , d@xmath32 and d@xmath33 , are occupied by two electrons in the low - temperature phase .",
    "these electrons do not have strong direct d - d overlap , but they can instead hop via bridging oxygens . by that process",
    ", the d@xmath32 electron from one site hops to a d@xmath33 orbital of the neighboring v , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ orbitals ] , where we show the v@xmath2 chain running along the c - direction in a more convenient projection .",
    "one sees indeed that e.g. the @xmath34-electron from the site v4a can hop to a @xmath35-state of the site v2b via a p@xmath36 orbital of the oxygen @xmath37 , and then again to @xmath34-orbital of the site v2a via the p@xmath36 orbital of oxygen d. similarly , there will exist hopping ( @xmath35)@xmath38 - ( p@xmath36)@xmath39 - ( @xmath34)@xmath40 - ( p@xmath36)@xmath15 - ( @xmath35)@xmath41  . as a result , we would have two degenerate half - filled one - dimensional ( 1d ) bands ( containing two electrons per v@xmath2 ) . such 1d bands",
    "would naturally give rise to peierls dimerization , which would open the gap in the spectrum and would decrease the energy.@xcite this is a possible explanation of the formation of dimers ( v4-v2 ) and ( v2-v4 ) in v@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "similar dimerization was recently found in the rutile - like v@xmath2 chains in vanadium hollandite k@xmath11v@xmath42o@xmath43,@xcite apparently due to the same mechanism .",
    "chains in the c - direction . due to the d@xmath19 electronic structure of these cations ,",
    "the magnetic interactions are mediated by bridging o p - orbitals , contrary to the direct v - v bond ( not shown ) that occurs in the v@xmath3-v@xmath3 chains . ]      to analyze the possibilility and the consequences of pairing of v atoms along each chain and to understand the magnetic properties of the compound , we have calculated the strength of the magnetic couplings in the unit cell .",
    "two kinds of couplings can be considered in each chain ( one short ( s ) and one long ( l ) ) plus the inter - chain coupling ( see fig . [ magnetic_gs ] ) .",
    "we have used our total energy calculations for different collinear magnetic configurations to quantify and describe these couplings . to that end , we have fitted the total energies by a heisenberg model , in the form @xmath44 , with s=1 for the v@xmath2 sites and s=1/2 for the v@xmath3 ones . the v@xmath3(d@xmath20 ) sites would be expected to undergo singlet spin pairing whereas the v@xmath2(d@xmath19 ) ones could pair in singlet , triplet or quintuplet spin states .",
    "the values of the in - chain coupling constants , obtained in our calculations , are : j@xmath45 40 k , j@xmath46 100 k , j@xmath47 10 k and j@xmath48 1000 k ( 3 and 4 stand for v@xmath2 and v@xmath3 chains , respectively , and  l / s \" stand for the long and short bonds ) .",
    "the short - bond magnetic coupling between paired v@xmath3 cations ( j@xmath49 ) is very large , @xmath50 k , indicating that most probably these ions form spin - singlet states , reminiscent of the ordering along the c - axis that happens in vo@xmath11.@xcite the situation is different in v@xmath2 chains , where also the short - bond magnetic coupling ( j@xmath51 ) is larger than that in the long bond ( j@xmath52 ) , but the difference is not as drastic as in the v@xmath3 chains .",
    "this suggests that spin singlets would not be formed in the v@xmath2 chains .",
    "the magnetic coupling strength between chains is quite small , but apparently sufficient to form long - range magnetic ordering below t@xmath53 k. we can thus propose that the magnetic structure of this state may be the afm ordering in v@xmath2 segments , coupled to v@xmath3 ions v3 with unpaired spins ( see figs . [ magnetic_gs ] and [ structures](a ) ) . due to the very small inter - chain magnetic coupling , two v@xmath3 cations per chain ( v3 ) could be left partially disordered , even at low temperatures.@xcite    previous works@xcite give further support to the importance of the pairing interactions as one of the driving forces for the mit . in the work by gossard _",
    "et al._,@xcite the pairing in the v@xmath3 chain ( corresponding to our j@xmath49 ) becomes complete only below 150 k ( 100 k below the mit transition ) .",
    "the magnetic coupling j@xmath49 estimated using their nuclear - resonance frequency shifts is also large ( j@xmath17 500 k at 100 k ) .",
    "the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectrum of spin - echo amplitudes observed at 4.2 k implies a continuous singlet spin pairing in the afm state , with the singlet v@xmath3 spin - pairs unbroken by the afm ordering .",
    "this is in agreement with our picture .",
    "in addition , the possible formation of singlet spin pairs along the v@xmath2 chains is also discussed in ref . .",
    "due to the two echo lines appearing in the nmr spectrum one possibility is that i ) one line arises from unpaired v@xmath3 with a moment of 1@xmath29 , while the other comes from paired v@xmath2 atoms which have reduced moments of 1@xmath29 , due to covalent singlet bonding of one of their two 3d electrons .",
    "the other option is : ii ) both lines arise from unpaired 4 + atoms that may have become crystallographically inequivalent in the afm state .",
    "structural results@xcite at 120 k , above the magnetic order temperature ( t@xmath16 ) , indicate the unpaired v@xmath3 at the shear planes are not inequivalent .",

    ", we can argue that although j@xmath51 is larger than the coupling of v@xmath2 spins in the long bond , we do not expect real spin - singlets to be formed in the v@xmath2 chains , but a more complicated spin structure is expected to develop . from our calculations , we can see that the magnetic moments obtained for the v@xmath2(d@xmath19 ) atoms are reduced by hybridizations from the purely ionic picture .",
    "also , the magnetic moment of these cations barely changes across the transition , as we saw in table [ momentos ] .",

    "the electronic structure of the high temperature / metallic phase does not present the large charge - ordering character , as the bond - length summations correctly suggest.@xcite we have performed lda+u calculations for the same magnetic configurations used for the low - temperature structure with the same u values .",
    "the magnetic ground - state is now fm and all the sites are almost equivalent : the electronic structure is close to v@xmath18 for all the atoms in the structure .",
    "the magnetic moments of the ground - state solution that can be seen in table [ momentos ] , are consistent with this picture .",
    "some difference is seen in the magnetic moments due to the different bandwidths of the respective d - bands , caused by the different environments the v cations are in , but no trace of co remains at high temperature , leading to a metallic solution . also , by looking at the band structures with ",

    "the fm high - temperature band structure is consistent with the absence of charge - ordering we are describing , since it shows more evenly distributed occupations in different bands . the spin density plot for the high temperature phase ( see fig .",
    "[ rho](b ) ) gives further evidence of this absence , confirming a noninteger charge occupation ( roughly v@xmath18 ) at all the v sites . even though a different dos is seen for each of the v sites in the high temperature structure ( right panels of fig .",
    "[ dos ] ) , the electron count is very similar for each of them , as the  fat bands \" and magnetic moments also show . the fm ordering ( or paramagnetic state experimentally found at high temperatures ) also increases the bandwidths when compared to the low - temperature co afm phase .",
    "the absence of co is supported by experimental works.@xcite the high temperature susceptibility data for v@xmath0o@xmath1@xcite are not conclusive about the sign of the curie - weiss temperature due to the high transition temperature .",
    "our calculations suggest a change to a fm nature of the in - chain couplings in the high - temperature phase .",
    "one can qualitatively interpret the fm coupling in the high - temperature metallic phase as a double exchange interaction .",
    "thus we see that , in analogy with vo@xmath11 , in the v@xmath3 chains there occurs an oo facilitating singlet pair formation .",
    "also , the analysis of the electronic structure helps to understand why only the inner ( v1-v1 ) v@xmath3 ions form such pairs , whereas ( v4-v2 ) and ( v2-v4 ) pairs are formed in v@xmath2 chains .",
    "this has to do with the orbital occupation in the v@xmath2 chains , different from that in the v@xmath3 chains : two orbitals , d@xmath32 and d@xmath33 , are occupied by two electrons at these sites , in contrast to d@xmath22 orbital occupation in v@xmath3 chains .",
    "apparently , this is responsible for somewhat weaker dimerization ( the changes in the v - v distance across the co transition are , @xmath55(v4-v2)@xmath56= 0.1  , as compared with @xmath55(v1-v1)@xmath56= 0.12  , see fig .",
    "this also leads to smaller modulation of the exchange constants within the v@xmath2 chains ( j@xmath57 = 100 k vs j@xmath58 = 40 k ) , whereas this difference is much larger in v@xmath3 segments ( j@xmath57 = 1000 k vs j@xmath58 = 10 k ) . as a result ,",
    "apparently v@xmath2 ions do not form singlets , despite dimerization , but participate in magnetic ordering , together with unpaired v@xmath3 ( v3 ) ions .",
    "this can explain the appearance of magnetic ordering at a relatively high temperature t@xmath16= 40 k.",
    "in this paper , we have studied the electronic structure of v@xmath0o@xmath1 analyzing the differences between the low - temperature ( charge ordered , antiferromagnetically ordered and insulating ) and the high - temperature ( charge disordered , paramagnetic and metallic ) phases .",
    "calculations show the strong co in the low - temperature phase that , together with structural distortions , lead to a gap opening .",
    "the high - temperature structure is charge disordered , with all v atoms in a similar @xmath17  d@xmath59 electronic configuration .",
    "all the in - chain magnetic couplings in the low - temperature phase are afm , and the inter - chain couplings are very weak ( and of different signs depending on the u - value ) . magnetic coupling changes to fm in the high - temperature phase as a result of the change in electron distribution caused by charge disorder .",
    "the afm couplings in the low - temperature phase are obtained , being very strong in the v@xmath3-v@xmath3 short bonds , one order of magnitude stronger than the short v@xmath2-v@xmath2 magnetic couplings ( and two orders of magnitude stronger than in the v@xmath3-v@xmath3 long bonds ) .",
    "this suggests the formation of a spin - singlet between the `` middle '' v s within the v@xmath3 chains , leaving v3 atoms with unpaired spins .",
    "the couplings in the v@xmath2 chains are more complicated , showing signs of slight moment reduction due to hybridizations .",
    "the oo obtained in our electronic structure calculations ( v@xmath3 :  d@xmath22 vs. v@xmath2 :  d@xmath32,d@xmath33 ) also helps to understand the different bond distance alternations that occur in the two different types of v chains : in the v@xmath3 chains there is a strong metal - metal bond between the `` middle '' v1 ions forming spin singlets , and an ( anti)ferroelectric - type displacement of the `` edge '' v@xmath3 ions at the shear planes . on the other hand , the v@xmath2 chains , due to different orbital occupation , form two one - dimensional - like bands due to bridging with oxygens , that affects the type of coupling along these chains and leads , in particular , to a dimerization of v@xmath2 chains , which , however , is not strong enough to make the short v@xmath2-v@xmath2 dimers spin singlets .    as a result ,",
    "most probably both the unpaired `` edge '' v@xmath3 and all v@xmath2 ions contribute to magnetic ordering below t@xmath16 , the detailed type of which is yet unknown",
    ". it would be very interesting to check the proposed magnetic ordering in v@xmath0o@xmath1 experimentally .",
