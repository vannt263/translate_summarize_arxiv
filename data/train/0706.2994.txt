    "the mass function of cold dark matter ( cdm ) halos emerging from the epoch of recombination is expected to be very steep , with a slope @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however , the slope of the luminosity function ( lf ) of galaxies in the local group is very flat , @xmath6 to @xmath7 @xcite , while trentham , sampson & banerij ( 2005 ) also find a very flat slope ( to @xmath8 ) in poor groups selected from the sloan survey .",
    "this is the well known small scale problem in cdm , for which a number of solutions ( involving suppression of dwarf galaxy formation in small haloes ) have been proposed . on the other hand",
    ", there is evidence that the lf of dwarf galaxies ( @xmath9 ) in rich clusters shows a steep upturn , approaching the predicted cdm value .",
    "originally discovered by @xcite and , independently , by @xcite , the existence of this faint - end upturn has recently been placed on a firmer footing by popesso et al .",
    "( 2006 , hereafter p06 ) , who detect it in all four bands of the composite lf of 69 x - ray selected clusters with sloan photometry .",
    "it is very unlikely that fluctuations in the background counts would be able to affect all 69 objects equally and produce an artificial steepening of the lf at faint luminosities .",
    "+ the origin of the upturn should have interesting consequences for theories of structure formation .",
    "if the upturn galaxies are primordial , they may be the relic building blocks of the original population of dwarf - sized fragments that went into constructing the cluster giants .",
    "however , the fact that the upturn is observed in rich environments but not in poor groups suggests that its origin is related to the cluster environment . unless the cluster acts to preserve a primordial population of faint dwarfs @xcite , it appears more likely that the upturn galaxies have undergone recent infall from the surrounding field @xcite .",
    "they may also have been whittled down from more massive objects ( conselice , wyse & gallagher 2001 ; @xcite ) .",
    "although the colors of present - day upturn galaxies are consistent with those of dwarf spheroidals on the red sequence ( p06 , @xcite ) , @xcite argues that one half of the fainter virgo dwarfs are actually blue .    the approach we follow here is to study the evolution of the faint - end upturn . in practice ,",
    "we derive deep lfs for distant clusters and attempt to compare the differential luminosity evolution of the bright cluster members ( which evolve passively ) and the upturn galaxies .",
    "if the upturn galaxies are primordial , they should evolve with the same speed as the giants , most of whose stellar populations were formed at high redshift .",
    "conversely , if the upturn consists of fading irregular galaxies @xcite , we should see a brighter onset of the steepening at higher redshifts , or , if the upturn galaxies have undergone recent infall from the field , a much flatter faint - end slope .",
    "we begin by considering two clusters at @xmath10 with deep archival hubble space telescope ( hst ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) imaging .",
    "while this choice is set by the availability of archival data , this is an interesting redshift as it corresponds to the epoch at which we witness the onset of the faint blue galaxies excess and the increase in the blue fraction in clusters of galaxies , both of which may be attributed to a population of star forming low luminosity galaxies temporarily brightened by star formation episodes ( e.g. , @xcite )    we derive a deep @xmath11 band lf for galaxies in the above clusters and compare with the p06 local sample .",
    "this latter represents the averaged lf of @xmath12 clusters to a depth comparable to our own and determined using similar methods ( statistical subtraction of non cluster members using counts in reference fields ) .",
    "an additional benefit is that the acs filters are designed to imitate the sloan passbands used in the photometry of local clusters by p06 . for these reasons ,",
    "we adopt their @xmath3 band lf as our comparison to measure evolution .",
    "the following section describes the data , their reduction , analysis and photometry .",
    "discussion of the results and their interpretation can be found in section 3 .",
    "we adopt the latest cosmology with @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 .",
    "we use two deep ( 10,000s total integration ) archival observations of the clusters abell 1835 ( at @xmath17 ) and ac 114 ( @xmath18 ) carried out with the acs in the @xmath11 ( f850lp ) filter ( pi : pell ; pid : 10154 ) .",
    "abell 1835 is a richness 0 cluster , similar to the fornax or virgo clusters ( but somewhat more massive ) , while ac 114 has richness class 2 and is therefore similar to the coma cluster .",
    "both clusters are therefore comparable to the p06 , although they lie on the high mass end of the distribution .",
    "we retrieved the individual flatfielded exposures from the hst archive and processed them through multidrizzle @xcite to produce a single registered image for each cluster , interpolated across the chip gaps and with cosmic rays and cosmetic defects removed .",
    "the final data products are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the images cover a total of 900 kpc on the side .",
    "for ac 114 the image is centred on the brightest cluster galaxies and spans a radius of 400 kpc , which is equivalent to 1/2 of the median @xmath19 ( the radius at which the cluster is 200 times denser than the field ) over which p06 compute their lfs .",
    "the geometry of a1835 is more complex . because of a bright star",
    ", the central cluster galaxy is shifted towards the eastern side of the image . the acs image of this cluster reaches out to the median @xmath19 value .",
    "+     as with all similar studies , and especially at the faint end , we can only determine cluster membership statistically .",
    "counts of field galaxies projected onto the cluster field of view can be estimated by observation of blank ( cluster - less ) fields .",
    "we note here that the luminosity distance to a1835 and ac114 is much larger than the largest structure present in local redshift surveys and therefore the counts in the direction of the clusters should reflect the cosmic mean ( the structure is uncorrelated with the cluster ) .",
    "we use the two goods fields @xcite as our reference fields , as these are the deepest and widest available images in the @xmath11 band .",
    "detection and photometry were carried out using sextractor @xcite using exactly the same parameters for the clusters and goods fields : a minimum detection ` aperture ' of 7 connected pixels above @xmath20 from the sky , which is equivalent to a 3@xmath21 detection .",
    "we measured photometry in an adaptive aperture and in a circular aperture of area equivalent to the minimum number of connected pixels , to derive a mean central surface brightness .",
    "the data were calibrated on the hst ab system using published zeropoints .",
    "2 shows plots of @xmath22 vs @xmath11 for objects in the cluster fields and the goods fields .",
    "the sequence of objects which constitues an upper envelope to the detections can be identified with stars .",
    "we can easily separate stars and galaxies to at least @xmath23 , which is fainter than the completeness limit we estimate below .",
    "we inspected our detections to remove a few objects ( in both cluster and goods fields ) that were deblended excessively by the sextractor algorithm ( usually bright spiral galaxies ) .",
    "for the few objects where this was necessary , we computed magnitudes in a single large aperture .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     it may be argued that the upturn is most evident in the outskirts of clusters , rather than in their cores ( p06 ) .",
    "@xcite find that the lf of what they term ` ultra - dwarfs ' is flatter in the core than in the outskirts .",
    "however , we sample between 1/2 of @xmath19 and @xmath19 and p06 detect a faint - end upturn , at least for red galaxies to which we are most sensitive in the @xmath11 band , even for @xmath24 ( their figure 11 ) .",
    "furthermore , the upturn is clearly detected by numerous authors even in the core ( indeed , especially in ) of the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "the two clusters we survey are also similar to local clusters : they have the same richness as coma or fornax and have x - ray properties similar to the sample of p06 .",
    "it is unlikely that differences in the cluster samples are responsible for our findings .",
    "neither does it appear likely that we are missing galaxies ( with respect to the sdss ) because of low surface brightness effects : sdss data are 50% complete at @xmath25 @xcite while we go considerably deeper ( at least @xmath26 ) .",
    "in ac114 and ac118 andreon , punzi & grado ( 2005 ) present a @xmath27-band lf of depth comparable to ours .",
    "the parameters for the lf in ac114 are virtually identical to ours and both lfs can be fitted by a single schechter function with no upturn .",
    "the most obvious interpretation is that the faint - end upturn is of recent origin .",
    "one possibility is that it consists of fading objects that have recently infallen from the field , where the lf for star - forming galaxies is actually quite steep @xcite .",
    "these galaxies may also be whittled down from formerly more massive objects , in the manner proposed by @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to speculate that these faint dwarfs are but the latest instalment in the buildup of the cluster red sequence .",
    "as we look back in time we see that the cluster dwarf population is progressively missing as low mass field galaxies are converted into dwarf ellipticals ( e.g. , @xcite ) : these very faint dwarfs may correspond to the very low amplitude fluctuations which are nowadays falling into the large scale structures for the first time .",
    "ultimately , we should be able to achieve a more complete understanding of these objects by studying a large number of clusters in several bandpasses and over wide fields .",
    "some hst archival data for this project are available and are being analyzed for a future publication but these include only the central regions of several intermediate redshift clusters .",
    "wide - field imaging on large telescopes may be needed to make further progress",

    "the reu program is supported by nsf grant 0353843 .",
