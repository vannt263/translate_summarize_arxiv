    "there is a rapidly expanding use of low temperature platforms ( @xmath1  k ) , for fundamental science , sensitive instrumentation , and new technologies of potentially significant commercial impact .",
    "the availability of commercial `` push button '' cryogen - free dilution refrigerators is a key game - changing recent development , in which european companies have played the leading role .",
    "the availability of cryogen - free commercial platforms to 1  mk is a future prospect @xcite .",
    "precise measurement of the thermodynamic temperature of these low temperature platforms is crucial for their operation .",
    "however , despite the sophisticated nature of the cooling technology , reliable and convenient thermometers are unavailable .    in the temperature range below 1",
    "k the dissemination of the kelvin is usually realised using secondary thermometers and superconducting reference points @xcite .",
    "examples include : resistance thermometers ; paramagnetic susceptibility ; vibrating wire / tuning fork viscometry .",
    "these thermometers do not reliably cover the temperature range 1  k to 10  mk ( a fortiori to 1  mk ) .",
    "the calibration of these thermometers against the plts-2000 @xcite is impractically time consuming and expensive .",
    "resistance thermometers are intrinsically subject to shifts in calibration and prone to self heating and pick - up of electromagnetic interference .",
    "paramagnetic - salt susceptibility thermometers are subject to degradation with time , and viscometric methods measure temperature inside the mixing chamber and not on the typical sample mounting platform .",
    "the dependence of @xmath2he melting pressure on temperature has been used as the laboratory standard in specialist laboratories for many years .",
    "the plts-2000 scale is based on the melting pressure of @xmath2he but this is viewed as difficult to implement for the rapidly expanding community of users of ultra - low temperature platforms . @xmath3co nuclear orientation thermometry is a primary technique that relies on the known anisotropy of the decay of radioactive nuclei as a function of temperature but is only effective in a narrow temperature range , and is slow and user unfriendly .",
    "nuclear magnetic susceptibility thermometry is likewise insensitive above 20  mk , and user unfriendly .",
    "reliable and traceable thermometry below 1  k thus offers demanding challenges even to the specialist , and , despite the sophisticated low temperature platforms now readily available with `` push - button '' operation , a solution which is reliable , traceable and user - friendly has yet to be developed .",
    "a quote attributed to prof o v lounasmaa , founder of the low temperature laboratory at helsinki university of technology ( now aalto university ) in the context of the t < 1 k regime reads `` a person with one thermometer knows what the temperature is ; a person with two will forever have doubt '' .",
    "the challenge is to rectify this state of affairs .",
    "the need to have a thermometer that measures thermodynamic temperature outside of international standards laboratories has led to the development of thermometers with a simple relationship between the measured parameter and the boltzmann constant , @xmath4 , for example thermometers that couple noise to a squid either directly @xcite or indirectly via the magnetic johnson noise @xcite and coulomb blockade thermometers @xcite based on electric conductance characteristics of tunnel junction arrays .    in this paper",
    "we describe recent advances in current sensing noise thermometer , exploiting low noise and high bandwidth dc squid amplifiers , for the high precision and rapid measurement of absolute temperature , covering the entire temperature range of interest from 4k to below 100 microk .",
    "the current sensing noise thermometer was pioneered by giffard et al.@xcite and developed by webb and washburn @xcite .",
    "the principle is to measure the thermal johnson noise @xcite in a resistor to determine its temperature .",
    "the performance of the thermometers developed in @xcite was limited by the noise of the rf squid amplifiers ; in @xcite the typical device noise temperature was a few mk . using a low transition temperature dc squid as the front end amplifier",
    "the current sensing technique becomes a practical approach for measuring absolute temperature from 4.2 k down to sub mk temperatures , as shown in @xcite ; this work used commercial dc squids .",
    "the improved sensitivity of dc squids fabricated at ptb @xcite allows the use of sensor resistors with much larger resistance , thereby increasing the speed of the thermometer . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate experimentally an improvement in speed by orders of magnitude and we demonstrate that the percentage precision is independent of temperature .    the principle of operation of a current sensing noise thermometer is discussed in detail in our earlier paper @xcite but is summarised below .",
    "the mean square open circuit noise voltage per unit bandwidth across the terminals of a resistor , @xmath5 , at temperature @xmath6 is given by the nyquist expression : @xmath7 this is a white noise spectrum over the frequency range of interest . in our current sensing noise thermometer , the resistor whose absolute temperature is to be measured is connected in series with the superconducting input coil of the readout squid through a superconducting twisted pair .",
    "the mean square noise current flowing in the squid input coil per unit bandwidth arising from the thermal noise in the resistor is then given by : @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "the time constant @xmath10 , where the total inductance in the input circuit @xmath11 includes the squid input coil inductance @xmath12 and any additional stray inductance including that of the twisted pairs . by increasing the resistance , it is possible to increase the bandwidth of the noise spectrum .",
    "however , this results in a reduced noise power from the resistor at @xmath13 , which must be kept much greater than the squid noise in order to ensure a reasonable device noise temperature , @xmath14 , much less than the minimum temperature we wish to measure .",
    "the squid is operated in flux - locked loop ( fll ) mode where the gain depends only on fixed , known parameters .",
    "thus , if the value of the resistive sensor and the squid gain can be measured , a current noise spectrum can be used to determine absolute temperature using equation [ eq:2 ] .",
    "can be at a different temperature to @xmath15 , the temperature of the squid . ]",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows a schematic of the measurement set - up . the squid sensor used in this work is a ptb two - stage squid @xcite with an input coil inductance of @xmath16  @xmath17h and a mutual inductance @xmath18 between the squid and the input coil equivalent to @xmath19  @xmath20a/@xmath21 , where @xmath21 is the flux quantum . when operated with a 10  k@xmath0 feedback resistor , the fll gain is 0.42  v/@xmath21 .",
    "the squid is located remotely from the sensor resistor , allowing the resistor to be placed in environments hostile to squid operation . in this case",
    "the squid is mounted on the continuous heat - exchanger plate of the dilution fridge at approximately 100  mk . at this temperature ,",
    "the white flux noise floor of the squid is @xmath22hz@xmath23 , equivalent to a coupled energy sensitivity , @xmath24 in units of planck s constant , where : @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the flux noise power .",
    "this can be compared to @xmath27 for the commercial quantum design @xcite squid operated at 4.2  k used in our previous work @xcite .",
    "this lower noise floor corresponds to a lower amplifier noise temperature @xmath14 .",
    "thus through choice of resistor the user can minimise the noise temperature for absolute precision or increase the bandwidth of the measurement for increased speed .",
    "the primary focus of this work was to establish the optimum choice of resistance value for operation of the thermometers on a dilution refrigerator ( with a typical base temperature of 5  mk ) .",
    "in addition in order to investigate the @xmath2he melting curve fixed points on the provisional low temperature scale plts-2000 we need a thermometer that can be reliably operated below 1  mk .",
    "for these reason we chose sensor resistance values of 0.2  m@xmath0 , 0.14  @xmath0 and 1.290  @xmath0 .",
    "the 0.2  m@xmath0 resistor was fabricated with a copper foil as described in @xcite . using this material it is not practical to make a sensor with a resistance greater than @xmath28  10  m@xmath0 .",
    "a higher resistivity material was needed for the 0.14  @xmath0 and 1.290  @xmath0 sensors . for this work 50",
    "@xmath17 m diameter platinum tungsten wire ( pt92%/w8% ) @xcite was used .",
    "ptw was chosen as it has a weakly temperature dependant resistivity as well as having a very small magneto - resistance @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] is a schematic diagram of the sensor resistor and the sample plate .",
    "the required length of ptw wire is achieved by hard soldering it to two pieces of 100  @xmath17 m thick copper foil separated by a well - defined gap , using johnson matthey easyflo2 solder .",
    "one foil is electrically grounded and consequently heat sunk to a large annealed copper holder with a copper screw contact . the other foil is electrically isolated from the holder .",
    "the sensor resistor is then connected to a pair of niobium screw terminals via short sections of cuni clad nbti wire .",
    "the screw terminals are connected to the remote squid input coil through a shielded nbti superconducting twisted pair .",
    "the resistor and copper former are enclosed in a niobium can for shielding and heat sunk to a copper sample plate with an m4 screw and cone joint as depicted in figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "for the tests of the 1.290  @xmath0 sensor the sample plate was mounted at the mixing chamber plate of the dilution fridge , the 0.2  m@xmath0 and 0.14  @xmath0 sensors were mounted directly on the top plate of a copper nuclear demagnetisation stage .",
    ".,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    in principle , the current sensing noise thermometer is a primary thermometer ; if the resistance of the sensor and the transfer function of the squid are known accurately . in practice however , it is more convenient to stabilise at a known reference temperature and determine the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath11 from a fit of the output noise power . for this single point calibration of our thermometers ,",
    "the sample plate was held at 500  mk , measured by the melting curve thermometer .",
    "the temperature stabilisation was realised with a digital pid temperature controller to within 5  @xmath17k .",
    "the squid output voltage is read out using room temperature magnicon xxf electronics @xcite and is captured with a pxi digitiser card @xcite .",
    "time traces were captured with sampling frequencies of 50  ks / s , 500  ks / s , 2.5  ms / s for 0.2  m@xmath0 , 0.14  @xmath0 and 1.290  @xmath0 sensors respectively , with a record length of 2@xmath29 points .",
    "1000 time domain traces were captured for each sensor .",
    "each captured time trace is individually fourier transformed and the power spectral density is averaged in the frequency domain for improved precision . before fitting , it was necessary to remove the noise power contribution of the squid , which was measured at high frequencies and assumed to be frequency independent over the range used for the fits .",
    "the current noise spectra obtained in this way are shown in figure [ fig:3 ] .",
    "fits were performed on the resulting current noise spectrum using equation [ eq:2 ] , with @xmath30  mk .",
    "the resulting values for the resistance of the noise sensor @xmath5 and total inductance of the circuit @xmath11 are summarised in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "these parameters were constrained in the fitting routine to determine the temperature of subsequent noise traces .",
    "an alternative method to obtain the single fixed point calibration is to integrate a superconducting fixed point directly into the input circuit of the thermometer .",
    "an additional coil can be added to the superconducting flux transformer , wound around a sample with a known superconducting transition temperature ; thermalized at the same point as the resistive sensor .",
    "the total inductance , @xmath11 , of the input circuit is then sensitive to the state of the superconducting fixed point .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] shows the temperature dependence of the inductance measured in a current sensing noise thermometer in which we have included an in - situ tantalum @xcite fixed point device ( @xmath31 = 4.45 k ) .",
    "here 12 turns of nbti wire are wound around a tantalum bobbin forming part of the superconducting flux transformer .",
    "the sharp transition of the tantalum is clearly visible in the noise thermometer measurement .    , of the noise thermometer input circuit as a function of temperature measured on the calibrated germanium resistance thermometer .",

    "figure [ fig:5 ] shows this comparison for all three thermometers . at each temperature above 6  mk the temperature was stabilised for 1 hour .",
    "excellent agreement between the thermometers was observed over a wide temperature range .",
    "deviations from the reference thermometer are observable up to progressively higher temperature for higher noise sensor resistance .",
    "this can be accounted for by a heat leak to the resistor resulting in a temperature gradient across the resistor .",
    "reducing the size of the heat leak through improving the heat sinking and filtering of the wires to the ` floating ' side of the sensor resistor will be the subject of future development .",
    "figure [ fig:6 ] shows the percentage deviation of the comparison between the 0.14  @xmath0 sensor and the melting curve thermometer . here",
    "an agreement to better than 1  % is achieved down to the lowest temperatures attainable on a commercial dilution refrigerator .",
    "it is clear that below 1  mk a relatively low sensor resistance is desirable to ensure good thermalization .",

    "plotted as a percentage of @xmath35.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    another figure of merit for a thermometer is the measurement time required to obtain a given precision of temperature measurement .",
    "if we consider capturing a time trace of @xmath36 points with a time @xmath37 between each point , for each point to be an independent measure of the square of the noise current , @xmath37 must be of order the correlation time of the noise or greater ( which for this system is the time constant @xmath38 ) .",
    "therefore in a measuring time @xmath39 one can make approximately @xmath40 independent measurements . a rough estimate for the precision in a given measuring time",
    "is thus given by : @xmath41    the percentage precision in a given measuring time is thus independent of temperature and determined by the noise bandwidth .",
    "the noise bandwidth for the sensors used is given in table [ tab:1 ] , and can be seen in figure [ fig:3 ] . increasing the resistance of the sensor results in an improved precision in a given time , which was the motive behind using ptw resistors with a larger resistance value .    to experimentally determine the precision of the 1.29  @xmath0 ptw thermometer ,",
    "the sample plate was stabilised at a known fixed temperature .",
    "single shot noise traces were taken consecutively .",
    "approximately 1000 individual spectra were captured for accurate statistics .",

    "figure [ fig:7]a shows data taken with the ptw thermometer stabilised at 493  mk using the germanium thermometer .",
    "this follows a normal distribution as shown by fig.[fig:7]b , where a gaussian fit to a histogram of temperatures is shown .",
    "the precision is calculated using @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the standard deviation of the data and @xmath6 is the mean temperature . in a measurement time of 419 ms , a precision of 0.50 % was obtained .",
    "this precision measurement was repeated at 1.5 k , 100 mk and at 13 mk ; the percentage precision was confirmed to be independent of temperature . reducing the measurement time to 105 ms , resulted in a temperature independent precision of 1.15  % .",
