    "recent experiments for electron - proton ( ep ) scattering , slac - e-136 [ 1 ] , desy - hera - he [ 2 ] , slac - e-133 [ 3 ] and others [ 4 ] , played important role in probing the nucleon structure and to reveal the dynamic mechanism of the electron interactions inside the nucleon bag .",
    "many trials have been done before by a wide variety of empirical and theoretical models , ranging from form factor scaling [ 5 ] , and vector meson dominance [ 6 ] to quark- parton models [ 7 ] and perturbative qcd [ 8 ] . an eikonal optical picture [",
    "9 - 10 ] was used , based on multiple scattering of the incident electron with the constituent valance quarks of the target hadron , assuming different forms of the ( electron - quark ) binary wave functions .    in this article",
    "we shall deal with the problem of elastic and inelastic collisions of the electron with proton from a different point of view . in the following , we present two pictures for the ( ep ) scattering .",
    "the first is a scattering in view of multi - photon exchange mechanism ( mpem ) which is very convenient for the elastic scattering in a wide range of momentum transfer square @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the multi - peripheral model ( mpm ) is relevant to the inelastic and deep inelastic scattering and so works properly for the problems of multi particle production .",
    "the article structure goes as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present the postulates of the mpem , the formulation and the scenario of the mpm are given in section 3 .",
    "the monte carlo generators are summarized in section 4 .",
    "finally results and discussion are given in section 5 , followed by conclusive remarks .",
    "it is assumed that elastic scattering of electrons on proton proceeds via multi step processes represented by ladder diagrams [ 11 ] .",
    "we proceed on the bases of the feynman formalisms , assuming electromagnetic interaction acting at each vertex of the ladder diagram fig.(1 ) . expanding the transition matrix @xmath1 of the ( ep ) scattering in terms of transition ladder diagrams",

    "similarly , the two step and the three step ladders will have the forms ,    @xmath21    @xmath22    @xmath23    the integrals in eqs.(5,6 ) are carried out by the dalitz integrals [ 12 ] .",
    "the expansion coefficients @xmath24 in eq.(1 ) are determined by fitting with the experimental data to estimate the statistical weight factor of each ladder diagram contributing the reaction . according to the usual formalism for the dynamics of the particle reactions [ 13 ] ,",

    "a factorizable transition matrix @xmath1 is assumed in the form ,    @xmath3    each particle in the final state is produced at a specific peripheral surface as shown by the feynman diagram fig.(2 ) with electromagnetic transition matrix @xmath36 , may be written in a suitable parametric form , @xmath37    where t@xmath38 is the four vector momentum transfer square at the @xmath39 peripheral surface .",

    "the energy @xmath56 of the particle number @xmath41 is related to its rapidity @xmath57 through the relation ,    @xmath58    @xmath59    so that the total energy of the particles in the final state is    @xmath60    @xmath61 which is a function of the parameters @xmath55 should be compared with the total center of mass energy@xmath62 of the initial state .",
    "we first start with @xmath29 to get @xmath63 , which is inserted again in the case @xmath64 to get @xmath65 and so on .",
    "these are repeated sequentially to get the values of the rest parameters up to @xmath66 .",

    "the phase space integral @xmath67 is then calculated as in eq.(7 ) after transforming the integral variables from @xmath68 to @xmath45 ,    @xmath69    @xmath70    @xmath71    @xmath72 are the upper and lower limits of @xmath45 corresponding to @xmath73    @xmath74    multiple integrals in eq.(18 ) are carried out using a monte carlo program , through which all possible distributions of the physical quantities are easily found .",
    "a monte carlo program gene2 [ 15 ] is developed to simulate events according to the multi peripheral diagrams .",
    "it includes 3-generators . the generator @xmath75 for the multiplicity of particles in the final state , the generator @xmath76 for the invariant masses produced at the @xmath77 possible peripheral surfaces and finally the dynamic generator @xmath78 which generates the values of the momentum transfer square @xmath45 of the @xmath39 surface according to electromagnetic transition matrix .",
    "the program gene2 executes the 3- generators in ordered sequences , and simulates all the kinematical variables of the n- particles in the final state .    a general form of the algorithm used to generate an event x with probability @xmath79 is ,    @xmath80    where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the boundaries of the physical region at which x is defined .",

    "fair agreement is obtained for the first reaction only .",
    "the deviation increases as the electron energy increases .",
    "this may be due to the fact that the model in hand has ignored the relative motion of the core inside the nucleon target .",
