    "quantile regression , introduced by @xcite , generalizes the notion of sample quantiles to linear and nonlinear regression models including the least absolute deviation estimation as its special case .",
    "the method provides an estimation of conditional quantile functions at any probability levels and it is well known that the family of estimated conditional quantiles sheds a new light on the impact of covariates on the conditional location , scale and shape of the response distribution : see @xcite .",
    "quantile regression has been widely used to analyze time series data as an alternative to the least squares method ( see @xcite ) since it is not only robust to heavy tails but also allows a flexible analysis of the covariate effects .",
    "especially , in risk management , it is also a functional tool to calculate the value - at - risk ( var ) .",
    "quantile regression has been studied in linear and nonlinear autoregressive models by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite : see also @xcite and @xcite , who handled ` linear ' autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity ( arch ) and generalized arch ( garch ) models , and @xcite who considered ordinary garch models .",
    "@xcite considered the quantile regression method for a broad class of time series models and designated the conditional autoregressive var ( caviar ) model .",
    "although the results of @xcite are applicable to a wide class of time series models , the caviar specification therein mainly focuses on the case of pure volatility models , as pointed out by @xcite and @xcite . unlike the previous studies dealing with the models having either conditional location or scale components , in this study , we take an approach to simultaneously estimate the conditional mean and variance through the quantile regression method . @xcite and @xcite explored the quantile regression for location - scale models without autoregressive structure and proposed a robust test for heteroscedasticity .",
    "this paper focuses on the quantile regression for a wide class of conditional location - scale time series models including the arma models with asymmetric garch ( agarch ) errors in which the dynamic relation between current and past observations is characterized in terms of a conditional mean and variance structure .",
    "typically , the conditional mean is assumed to follow an either ar or arma type model and the conditional volatility is assumed to follow a garch type model ( @xcite ) . here",
    ", we demonstrate that the quantile regression can be extended to conditional location - scale models rather than mean - variance models through a slight modification , and as such , the estimation of the conditional location and scale can be properly carried out .",
    "more precisely , to activate the proposed method , we remove the constraints imposed on the mean and variance of the model innovations and reformulate the mean - variance model to become the conditional location - scale model described in section  [ subsec22 ] .",
    "it is noteworthy that the reformulated models to incur the quantile regression estimation are exactly the same as those in ( 1.3 ) of @xcite who pointed out that non - gaussian quasi - maximum likelihood ( qml ) estimators may be inconsistent in the usual conditional mean - variance models and instead proposed location - scale models to remedy an asymptotic bias effect . from this angle , it may be mentioned that our quantile regression method is comparable with other estimation methods like the gaussian and non - gaussian qml estimation methods .    in this study , we intend to verify the strong consistency and asymptotic normality of quantile regression estimators in general conditional location - scale time series models .",
    "particularly , in the derivation of the @xmath2-consistency , one has to overcome the difficulty caused by the lack of smoothness of the quantile regression loss function . to resolve this problem",
    ", we adopt the idea of @xcite and @xcite and extend lemma  3 of @xcite to stationary and ergodic time series cases ; see section  [ subsec23 ] and lemma  [ br lemma ] in the appendix for details .",
    "to apply the obtained results in general models to the arma - agarch model , we deduce certain primitive conditions leading to the desired asymptotic properties . here , the task of checking the identifiability condition appears to be quite demanding and accordingly a newly designed technique is proposed : see remark  [ identifiability proof remark ] below .    in comparison to @xcite ,",
    "our approach has merit in its own right .",
    "first , a weaker moment condition is used to obtain the asymptotic normality : for instance , in the arma - agarch model , only a finite second moment condition is required while a third moment condition is demanded in their paper .",
    "second , more basic conditions such as strict stationarity and ergodicity of models are assumed in our case rather than the law of large numbers and central limit theorems assumed in their paper : however , more general data generating processes are considered therein .",
    "third , our parametrization of conditional quantile functions exhibits a more explicit relationship with the parametrization of original models .",
    "finally , a general identifiability condition is provided for the arma - agarch model and is rigorously verified .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    ", we introduce the general conditional location - scale time series models and establish the asymptotic properties of the quantile regression estimator . in section  [ sec3 ] , we verify the conditions for the strong consistency and asymptotic normality in the arma - agarch model . in section  [ sec4 ] , we report a finite sample performance of the estimator in comparison with the gaussian - qmle . in section  [ sec5 ] ,",
    "we demonstrate the validity of our method by analyzing the daily returns of hong kong hang seng index .",
    "all the proofs are provided in the appendix and the supplementary material .",
    "before we proceed to general conditional location - scale models ( see ( [ loc - scale model ] ) below ) , we first illustrate conditional quantile estimation for the ar(@xmath3)-arch(@xmath3 ) model : @xmath4 where @xmath5 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables with @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in",
    "what follows , we denote by @xmath8 the @xmath9-field generated by @xmath10 .",
    "provided that @xmath11 is independent of @xmath12 , the @xmath13th conditional quantile of @xmath14 given @xmath12 can be expressed as @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "since the @xmath13th quantile of @xmath11 is unknown , it is apparent that the parameters in ( [ cond quantile of ar - arch ] ) are not identifiable . as in @xcite ,",
    "this problem can be overcome by reparameterizing the arch component as follows : @xmath17 with @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . here",
    ", @xmath21 is only proportional to the conditional standard deviation , and thus , can be interpreted to be a conditional scale : this reparameterization procedure expresses the arch model as a conditional scale model with no scale constraints on the i.i.d .",
    "the conditional quantile in this case is then expressed as @xmath22 wherein the parameters can be shown to be identifiable : see lemma  [ identification lemma ] that deals with more general arma - agarch models .",
    "in fact , the condition @xmath6 in ( [ ar - arch eqn ] ) is not necessarily required to deduce the conditional quantile function , since the conditional quantile specification in ( [ cond quantile of repra ar - arch ] ) is also valid for the ar(@xmath3)-arch(@xmath3 ) model without assuming this condition .",
    "as seen in section  [ subsec23 ] , conditional quantile estimators and their asymptotic properties are irrelevant to the location constraint on @xmath23 , and thus , the condition of @xmath24 is not needed for estimating conditional quantiles .",
    "an analogous approach will be taken to handle the quantile regression for general location - scale models .",
    "let us consider the general conditional location - scale model of the form : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively denote @xmath28 and @xmath29 for some measurable functions @xmath30 ; @xmath31 denotes the true model parameter ; @xmath32 is a model parameter space ; @xmath33 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables with an unknown common distribution function @xmath34 .    many conditionally heteroscedastic time series models can be described by the autoregressive representation addressed in ( [ loc - scale model ] ) .",
    "for example , the reparameterized ar(@xmath3)-arch(@xmath3 ) model in section  [ subsec21 ] can be expressed as a form of ( [ loc - scale model ] ) with @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "further , it can be readily seen that invertible arma models and stationary garch models also admit the form of ( [ loc - scale model ] ) : see theorem  2.1 of @xcite for the latter . in section  [ sec3 ] , the arma - agarch model will be expressed as a form of ( [ loc - scale model ] ) .    in order to facilitate the conditional quantile estimation , model  ( [ loc - scale model ] ) is assumed to be a reparameterized version of the time series models as discussed in section  [ subsec21 ] , and as such , the innovation distribution @xmath34 is not assumed to have zero mean and unit variance and @xmath27 is interpreted to be a relative conditional scale rather than variance . however , restricted to arma - agarch models in sections  [ sec3][sec5 ] , we focus on the case of @xmath38 considering the popularity in practice .",
    "in what follows , the following conditions are presumed :    * @xmath39 satisfying ( [ loc - scale model ] ) is strictly stationary and ergodic . *",
    "@xmath23 is independent of @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "conditions * ( m1 ) * and * ( m2 ) * hold for a broad class of time series models .",
    "for example , @xcite verified that the garch model is strictly stationary if and only if its lyapunov exponent is negative , which actually entails * ( m2)*. @xcite provided sufficient conditions for the stationarity and ergodicity in general conditional variance models .",
    "@xcite provided such conditions in nonlinear ar models with garch errors . in section  [ sec3 ] , we specify some conditions for the arma - agarch model to admit the autoregressive representation in ( [ loc - scale model ] ) and also to satisfy * ( m1 ) * and * ( m2)*.    under * ( m2 ) * , the @xmath13th quantile of @xmath14 conditional on the past observations is given by @xmath42 for @xmath43 , wherein the innovation quantile @xmath44 appears as a new parameter .",
    "we denote by @xmath45 the true parameter vector .",
    "note that the conditional quantile @xmath46 can be expressed as a function of the infinite number of past observations and parameter @xmath47 .",
    "then , taking into consideration the form of @xmath46 , given the stationary solution @xmath48 to model  ( [ loc - scale model ] ) and a parameter vector @xmath49 , we introduce conditional quantile functions : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a parameter within a domain that allows the above autoregressive representation . in practice , since @xmath52 is unobservable , we can not obtain @xmath53 .",
    "thus , we approximate them with observable @xmath54 . a typical example is @xmath55 , where all @xmath14 with @xmath56 are put to be 0 : see @xcite .",
    "one can also use a model specific approximation as in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "then , the @xmath13th quantile regression estimator of @xmath47 for model  ( [ loc - scale model ] ) is defined by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a parameter space , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 denotes the indicator function .",
    "in this subsection , we show the strong consistency and asymptotic normality of the quantile regression estimator defined in ( [ def of qre ] ) .",
    "the result is applicable to various mean - variance time series models including the arma - agarch model handled in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "the asymptotic properties are proved by utilizing the affinity between @xmath61 and @xmath62 , similarly to the case of the qml estimator in garch - type models : see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the references therein .",
    "however , the asymptotic normality is derived in a nonstandard situation , as discussed below , owing to the non - differentiability of the loss function @xmath63 .    in what follows",
    ", we define @xmath64 for matrix @xmath65 . to verify the consistency of @xmath66",
    ", we introduce the following assumptions :    ( c1 ) : :    the @xmath13th quantile of @xmath67 is unique , that    is ,    @xmath68    for all @xmath69 .",

    "then , @xmath81 a.s .",
    "as @xmath82 .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath83 in ( [ def of q_t(theta ) ] ) is strictly stationary and ergodic for each @xmath84 ( see proposition  2.5 of @xcite ) , while its approximation @xmath85 in ( [ def of qre ] ) is not so since @xmath86 is recursively defined with given initials .",
    "( c2 ) * , * ( c3 ) * and * ( c6 ) * are needed to show the uniform convergence of the objective function in ( [ def of qre ] ) , based on the ergodic theorem of @xcite .",
    "it can be shown from assumptions * ( c1 ) * , * ( c4 ) * and * ( c5 ) * that the a.s .",
    "limit of the objective function is uniquely minimized at @xmath77 .",
    "conventionally , all the assumptions excepting the identifiability assumption * ( c4 ) * are easy to check from the existing literatures .",
    "the arma - agarch model can be shown to satisfy these conditions in section  [ sec3 ] , based on @xcite and @xcite .",
    "below , we discuss two issues as to * ( c4)*. first , when @xmath87 , * ( c4 ) * is not satisfied for heteroscedastic models . it is because the parameters involved in @xmath27 is not identifiable as seen in the garch model : see remark  3 of @xcite . if @xmath88 , only the parameters in the conditional location is estimable via using @xcite who proposed the conditional median estimation for some models similar to ( [ loc - scale model ] ) when @xmath89 .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath13th conditional quantile estimation for heteroscedastic models requires a different conditional quantile specification at some @xmath13 , usually the one corresponding to a center of locations .",
    "secondly , the verification of * ( c4 ) * is non - standard even in the ar(@xmath3)-arch(@xmath3 ) model , see ( [ cond quantile of repra ar - arch ] ) .",
    "it is mainly because the conditional quantile function ( [ def of q_t(theta ) ] ) is a nonlinear function of parameters .",
    "we verify * ( c4 ) * for the arma - agarch model in lemma  [ identification lemma ] below by using the method introduced in @xcite , which may be applicable to the models other than the arma - agarch model .    turning to the asymptotic normality issue of quantile regression estimator @xmath66 , notice that the objective function in ( [ def of qre ] ) is not twice differentiable with respect to @xmath84 even if @xmath90 is smooth , and",
    "thus , a second order taylor s expansion is not applicable .",
    "this lack of smoothness in the quantile regression is often overcome by using the empirical process techniques : see , for instance , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite designed a method to derive the asymptotic normality under nonstandard conditions and @xcite recast this method using the empirical process techniques .",

    "these moment conditions can be additionally relaxed by using weighted likelihoods ( @xcite ) or other non - gaussian likelihoods ( @xcite ) . in view of these results , it can be reasoned that quantile regression approach in this study also makes a reasonably good robust method in a broad class of time series models .",

    "then , using @xmath650 , we get @xmath651 this in turn implies @xmath652 .",
    "further , by virtue of lemma  3.2 of @xcite , similarly , we can have @xmath653 .",
    "hence , * ( n3)*(ii ) is satisfied . on the other hand ,",
    "simple algebras show that @xmath654 . then , using this and lemma  3.3 of @xcite , it can be readily checked that @xmath655 .",
    "hence , by using * ( n3)*(ii ) and the equality @xmath656 we can see that * ( n3)*(iii ) holds .",
    "meanwhile , owing to ( [ tilde eps filter representation ] ) , ( [ tilde h_t^2 filter representation ] ) and ( [ derivative of q_t ] ) , we can derive @xmath657 in a similar fashion to obtain ( [ closeness of eps_t and tilde])([closeness of h_t^2 and tilde ] ) . thus , by using the inequality @xmath658 we can see that @xmath659 , which ensures * ( n4)*(ii ) .",
    "further , by using similar arguments to verify ( [ bddness of tilde eps_t ] ) and * ( n3)*(iii ) , one can easily check that * ( n4)*(iii ) holds . finally , * ( n5 ) * is a direct result of lemma  [ positive definiteness ] .",
    "therefore , the asymptotic normality is asserted by theorem  [ asymptotic normality ] .",
    "this completes the proof ."
