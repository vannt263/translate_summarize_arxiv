    "wireless relay networks are ubiquitous from classical satellite communications to the increasing use of wireless ad hoc networks where mobiles , tablets , or laptops have the ability to act as wireless relays for other similar devices .",
    "a common coding strategy deployed in relay networks is for the relays to decode the source message , and then forward a function of the message ( e.g. , some parity bits ) to the destination to facilitate decoding . in this context , one can use a _ partial - decode - forward ( pdf ) _ scheme where the relays decode only a fraction of the source message and forward a function of the decoded part , or a _ complete - decode - forward ( cdf ) _ scheme where the relays fully decode the source message and forward a function of it .",
    "another consideration in designing wireless relay networks is whether to use a full - duplex ( communication possible in both directions simultaneously without interference ) or a half - duplex ( communication possible in only one direction at a time ) scheme . the choice of full- versus half - duplex , as well as the choice of cdf or pdf , impacts on the achievable communication rate .",
    "achievable rates have been demonstrated for the full - duplex relay channel using cdf @xcite and pdf @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "16.3 ) , and for the half - duplex relay channel using cdf @xcite and pdf @xcite .",
    "pdf includes cdf and direct transmission as special cases  the relay decodes all source messages in the former and decodes nothing in the latter .",
    "for the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) full - duplex relay channel , it has been shown  @xcite that ( i ) when the source - destination link is better than the source - relay link , the maximum pdf rate can be achieved by not using the relay at all , i.e. , direct transmission ; and ( ii ) when the source - relay link is better than the source - destination link , the maximum pdf rate can be achieved by having the relay decoding all source messages , i.e. , cdf .",
    "while it is not desirable to have the relay decoding only part of the messages in the awgn full - duplex relay channel , pdf can achieve rates strictly higher than direct transmission and cdf in the half - duplex counterpart .      in this paper",
    ", we focus on the half - duplex relay channel , and compare the rates achievable by existing coding schemes . for a given half - duplex relay channel ,",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be the maximum rates achievable ( optimized over channel codes under respective coding schemes ) using the complete - decode - forward and the partial - decode - forward schemes respectively .",
    "for the trivial case where the source - destination link is better than the source - relay link , @xmath1 can be attained by direct transmission ( similar to the full - duplex case ) .",
    "otherwise , we have the following :    [ theorem : main ] consider the awgn half - duplex single - relay channel .",
    "if the source - relay link is better than the source - destination link , then @xmath2    this means regardless of channel parameters , partial decoding can achieve at most 12.5% rate gain compared to full decoding .",
    "we further show that in the following three asymptotic cases , pdf and cdf actually achieve the same rates : ( i ) the relay is close to the source , ( ii ) the relay is close to the destination , and ( iii ) the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is low .",
    "we also show that for the case of high snr , cdf achieves rates within a constant bit gap ( which is a function of the channel gains ) of that achievable by pdf .",
    "this gap , when normalized to the cdf rate , diminishes as the snr increases . theoretically , this work gives an upper bound to the performance gain of pdf over cdf .",
    "practically , it shows that without a significant percentage loss in transmission rate , one could choose cdf over pdf , as the former is potentially less complex to implement , and is certainly less complex to design .",
