    "in the following we are interested in the collinear limit at @xmath34 . at this order there are two different collinear limits to be considered @xcite .",
    "the first is when _ two pairs _ of parton momenta become independently parallel . in this case",
    "the factorization formula is obtained by a simple iteration of eq .",
    "( [ cfac ] ) . in the second case three parton momenta can simultaneously become parallel . denoting these momenta by @xmath35 and @xmath36 ,",

    "( [ cfac ] ) .",
    "the spin correlations produced by the collinear splitting are taken into account in a universal way , i.e. independently of the specific matrix element on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ccfac ] ) . besides depending on the spin of the parent parton , the functions @xmath43 depend on the momenta @xmath44 .",

    "= 52truemm    details on the method and on our calculation are given in ref .",
    "the basic observation is that if we rescale the transverse momenta as @xmath48 the matrix element squared has the singular behaviour | _ a_1,a_2,a_3,  (p_1,p_2,p_3 ,  ) |^2 ~1/^4 + ... where dots stand for less singular contributions when @xmath49 . to extract the singular behaviour one has to put on shell the parent parton leg in fig .",
    "1 . since @xmath50 , in order to do this we have to neglect @xmath51 terms from the amplitude which may affect in a non - universal way the singular behaviour .",
    "but since we are interested in the _ most singular _ behaviour we can safely put @xmath52 and reconstruct the gauge invariant spin polarization tensor in ( [ ccfac ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath43 can be computed by evaluating the process independent diagrams in fig.1 in the collinear limit .",
    "our explicit results are presented in @xcite .",
    "we find that when the parent parton is a fermion , spin - correlations are absent .",
    "this is analogous to what happens at @xmath0 and it is a consequence of helicity conservation in the quark vector coupling . on the contrary , in the case in which the parent parton is a gluon spin correlations are highly non trivial .",
    "a check of the calculation is provided by the strong - ordered limit . in this limit",
    "the three partons become collinear sequentially and @xmath53 factorize in the product of two ap splitting functions . a further non - trivial check of the calculation is provided by supersymmetry . as for ap splitting functions , we find that @xmath43 obey a @xmath54 susy identity in the limit @xmath55 and when @xmath56 : & & + = p_g_1g_2g_3+which express the fact that the total quark ( actually , gluino ) and gluon decay probability are the same .    the @xmath34-collinear limit of tree - level qcd amplitudes has been independently considered by campbell and glover @xcite . taking for granted eq .",
    "( [ ccfac ] ) they neglected spin correlations and computed only the spin - averaged splitting functions by performing the limit of known amplitudes .",

    "the singular behaviour of the matrix element squared is controlled by process - independent splitting functions , which are analogous to the altarelli ",

    "these splitting functions are one of the necessary ingredients to extend qcd predictions at higher perturbative orders . in particular",
    ", they will be relevant to set up general methods to compute jet cross sections at nnlo .",
    "the knowledge of the collinear splitting functions , when combined with a consistent analysis of soft - gluon coherence properties , could also be used to improve the logarithmic accuracy of parton showers available at present for monte carlo event generators .",
