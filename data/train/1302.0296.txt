    "channel state information ( csi ) plays a central role in the design of physical layer interference management strategies for wireless networks . as a result ,",
    "training - based channel estimation techniques ( i.e. transmission of known training symbols or `` pilots '' ) are commonly used in today s wireless networks to estimate the channel parameters at the receivers and then to propagate the estimates to other nodes in the network via feedback links . however , as wireless networks grow in size and mobility increases , the availability of channel state information at the transmitters ( csit ) becomes a challenging task to accomplish .",
    "consequently , there has been a growing interest in understanding how the lack of csi would have an impact on fundamental limits of interference management in wireless networks . in particular , in the context of interference channels , various settings for csit have been studied in the literature , such as no csit ( e.g. , @xcite ) , local csit ( e.g. , @xcite ) and delayed csit ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the impact of knowledge about network topology on interference management in @xmath0-user interference networks .",
    "we consider an interference network consisting of @xmath0 transmitters and @xmath0 receivers , where each transmitter intends to deliver a message to its corresponding receiver . in order to model propagation path loss and interference topology ,",
    "the network is considered to be partially connected ( in which `` weak channels '' are removed by setting their channel gains to zero ) , and the network topology is represented by the adjacency matrix of the network connectivity graph .",
    "similar partial connectivity models have been studied in @xcite . however , in this work , we assume that all nodes are aware of network topology , i.e. the adjacency matrix of the network graph , but beyond that , the transmitters have no information about the actual values of the channel gains in the network ( i.e. , no - csit beyond knowing the topology ) .",
    "this is partially motivated by the fact the network connectivity often changes at a much slower pace than the channel gains , hence it is plausible to acquire them at the transmitters . in this setting , the goal is to understand the limits at which the knowledge about network topology can be utilized to manage the interference .    this problem has been also considered in some prior works in the literature . in  @xcite ,",
    "a slow fading scenario is considered , in which the channel gains associated with existing links in the network remain constant . in this",
    "setting , authors have used a `` normalized sum - capacity '' metric in order to characterize the largest fraction of the sum - capacity - with - full - csi that can be obtained when transmitters only know network topology and the gains of some local channels . via the characterization of normalized sum - capacity for several classes of network topologies and development of two interference management strategies , namely coded set scheduling and independent graph scheduling",
    ", it has been shown that the knowledge about network topology can be effectively utilized to increase sum - capacity .    in another work  @xcite , which is more related to this paper , a fast fading scenario",
    "is considered in which the channel gains of the existing links in the network are considered to be identically and independently distributed over time ( with a sufficiently large coherence time ) and also across the users .",
    "it has been shown that the dof region of this problem is bounded above by the dof region of a corresponding wireless index coding problem , and they are equivalent if both problems are restricted to linear solutions and the coherence time of the channels is sufficiently large .",
    "a similar approach has been taken in @xcite , in which a slow fading scenario is considered and the channel gain values are assumed to be sufficiently large to satisfy a minimum signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) at each receiver . it is shown that , quite interestingly , the degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) of this problem has a counterpart in the capacity analysis of wired networks .",
    "this connection enabled the derivation of several outer bounds on the symmetric dof , and the development of an interference - alignment - based achievability scheme .",
    "also , necessary and sufficient conditions have been derived for networks to achieve a symmetric dof of @xmath1 .    in this paper , we focus on the fast fading scenario with only network topology knowledge at the nodes , where the all the channel gains are assumed to undergo i.i.d . fading .",
    "we derive new graph theoretic and linear algebraic inner and outer bounds on the symmetric dof . to derive the outer bounds",
    ", we will introduce two novel linear algebraic concepts , namely `` generators '' and `` fractional generators '' , and utilize them to upper bound the symmetric dof for general network topologies .",
    "the key idea of generators is that in any network topology , we seek for a number of signals from which we can decode the messages of all the users , and then we will find an upper bound for the joint entropy of those signals . instead of upper bounding this joint entropy proportionally to the number of the signals",
    ", we will use the concept of fractional generators to find the tightest upper bound on the entropy of the signals based on the interference interactions at the receivers .",
    "we will demonstrate , through examples , that we can systematically apply our outer bounds to any arbitrary network topology .",
    "moreover , we will present three inner bounds based on three achievable schemes .",
    "first , we discuss two benchmark schemes and characterize their achievable symmetric dof with respect to two graph theoretic parameters of the network graph , namely `` maximum receiver degree '' and `` fractional chromatic number '' . through examples ,",
    "we show that these schemes are suboptimal in some networks and gain can be accomplished by taking more details of network topology into account .",
    "this motivates the third scheme , called `` structured repetition coding '' , which performs at least the same as or strictly better than the two benchmark schemes .",
    "the main idea of this scheme is to enable neutralization of interference at the receivers by repeating the symbols based on a carefully - chosen structure at the transmitters .",
    "we derive graph theoretic conditions , based on the matching number of bipartite graphs induced by network topology and the repetition structure of transmitters , that characterize the symmetric dof achieved by structured repetition coding .",
    "finally , we will evaluate our inner and outer bounds so as to characterize the symmetric dof in two interesting practical scenarios .",
    "first , we consider 6-user networks composed of 6 square cells in which each receiver receives interference from at least one and at most three of its adjacent cells , as well as the signal from its own transmitter .",
    "interestingly , after removing isomorphic graphs , we see that our inner and outer bounds meet for all 22336 possible network topologies except 16 , hence characterizing the symmetric dof in those cases .",
    "second , we consider 6-user networks with 1 central and 5 surrounding base stations and evaluate our inner and outer bounds for a large number of randomly generated client locations . in this case , the results show that our bounds are tight for all generated network topologies . in both scenarios , we will demonstrate the distribution of the gain of structured repetition coding over the two benchmark schemes and study the impact of network density on these gains .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ form_not ]",
    "we introduce the problem model and notations . in section [ converse ]",
    "we present our outer bounds on the symmetric dof . in section [ ach ]",
    "we present our achievable schemes . in section [ sim ]",
    "we present our numerical analysis for the aforementioned network scenarios .",

    "this leads to a new scheme which will be introduced in the following section .",
    "we now present a scheme based on structured repetition codes at the transmitters so that we can better exploit structure of network topology .",

    "we will motivate the idea of structured repetition coding through the following example .",
    "but before starting the example , we need the following definition .",
    "[ def_match ] for a graph @xmath334 , a _ matching _ is a subset of edges no two of which share a common vertex .",
    "the _ matching number _ of @xmath340 , denoted by @xmath364 , is the size of a maximum matching of @xmath340 ( a matching of @xmath340 containing the largest possible number of edges ) .",

    "we claim that in this network , the symmetric dof of @xmath261 is achievable , while the benchmark schemes discussed in the previous section can at most achieve a symmetric dof of @xmath356 .    in this network ,",
    "the outer bound for the symmetric dof is @xmath360 by corollary [ cor1 ] , because the sets @xmath365 and @xmath358 satisfy the conditions of the corollary ; i.e. in the subnetwork @xmath146 , we can generate statistically similar versions of the signals at receivers 3 and 1 by having the received signal at receiver 2 .",
    "therefore , @xmath366 .",

    "thus , our two previous schemes both achieve the same symmetric dof of @xmath356 which is strictly lower than the outer bound of @xmath261 .",
    "now , let us see if the achievable symmetric dof can be improved .",

    "2 .   figure [ fig10 ] illustrates the impact of the number of interfering links on the performance of structured repetition coding compared to benchmark schemes . as it is clear , the gain is not much when the network is too dense .",
    "however , if the density of the network , characterized by the number of cross links in the network , is at a moderate level , then the gain of structured repetition coding over the benchmark schemes can be significant .",
    "it is worth mentioning that there are totally around 50 percent and 10 percent of the networks in which structured repetition coding outperforms random gaussian coding and interference avoidance , respectively .",

    "however , the best symmetric dof achieved by random gaussian coding is @xmath356 , hence a gain of 2 can be obtained over this scheme .",
    "this implies that for all these 14 networks , there exists a receiver whose degree is 4 ( receiver @xmath406 in figure [ fig12a ] ) . moreover ,",
    "another pattern that is common among these 14 `` high - yield '' topologies is that the three users which are interfering to the receiver with degree 4 are mutually non - interfering , hence constituting an independent set ( users \\{3,4,5 } in figure [ fig12a ] ) .",
    "the third common feature of all these topologies is containing a 3-user cyclic chain ( a 3-user network with users @xmath47,@xmath296 and @xmath375 where @xmath7 is connected to @xmath8 , @xmath493 is connected to @xmath494 , and @xmath495 is connected to @xmath9 ) .",
    "the subgraph consisting of users \\{1,2,3 } in figure [ fig12a ] is a 3-user cyclic chain .",
    "this is the main reason that interference avoidance can achieve no better than the symmetric dof of @xmath261 in these networks , allowing structured repetition coding to have a gain of @xmath496 over it .      in this section",
    ", we explore another class of 6-user networks , consisting of 1 base station ( bs ) located in the center of a circle with radius 1 , and 5 other base stations located uniformly on the boundary of the circle .",
    "each base station has a coverage radius of @xmath497 , with a mobile client randomly located in its coverage area .",

    "again , as we had in figure [ fig8 ] , the blue triangles represent base stations , the green crosses represent mobile clients , the black circle represents the unit circle and the red circles depict the coverage area of each bs .",
    "obviously , any placement of the mobile clients corresponds to a partially - connected 6-user interference network .    to analyze our bounds for this class of networks , we generated 12000 network instances by randomly locating the mobile clients for the case of @xmath498 .",
    "upon removing isomorphic graphs , we ended up with 1507 distinct topologies and evaluated our inner and outer bounds for these topologies , leading to the following conclusions .    1 .",
    "we find out interestingly , that our bounds are tight in all the generated network topologies , and figure [ fig16 ] illustrates the distribution of @xmath56 among these topologies .",
    "we note that @xmath56 takes 4 distinct values in @xmath499 .",
    "the most frequent value that @xmath56 takes is @xmath261 , followed by @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ fig_13 ] illustrates the effect of the number of cross links in the network , which is a measure of density of the network graph , on the fraction of topologies which yield gains over benchmark schemes .",
    "the trend is similar to that of figure [ fig10 ] , showing that if the network graph is too sparse ( few number of cross links ) or too dense ( high number of cross links ) , there is not much gain beyond the benchmark schemes .",
    "however , if the network graph is moderately dense , then structured repetition coding can attain gain over the benchmark schemes in a larger fraction of networks .",
    "moreover , the figure implies that , on average , interference avoidance yields higher inner bounds on @xmath56 than random gaussian coding , in this class of networks .",
    "3 .   figure [ fig18a ] illustrates the distribution of the gain of structured repetition coding over random gaussian coding among the topologies in which this gain is greater than unity .",

    "moreover , among the networks in which there is a gain over interference avoidance , this gain can take 2 distinct values in @xmath501 , with the distribution shown in figure [ fig18b ] .",
    "the most frequent value of both of the gains is @xmath496 , which indicates a 50% improvement in the inner bound on @xmath56 .",

    "this shows that in some topologies , letting @xmath504 may yield higher inner bounds by structured repetition coding than @xmath485 .",
