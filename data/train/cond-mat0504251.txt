    "the study of electron transport in mesoscopic systems is a fundamental problem in nanophysics and nanotechnology @xcite and rests on landauer s idea that conductance is proportional to phase - coherent electron transmittivity @xcite . within this context",
    "a great deal of attention has been given in recent years to electronic transport in a variety of structures including polymeric and molecular wires , nanotubes and quantum wires , quantum dots , and arrays and networks of quantum dots .",
    "a semiconductor quantum dot ( qd ) is often described as an artificial atom , in which an external potential replaces the attractive potential of the nucleus to confine charge carriers in all three spatial directions @xcite .",
    "the dot size is of the order of the fermi wavelength in the host material , typically between 10 nm and 1@xmath1 m , and the confinement is usually achieved by electrical gating of a two - dimensional electron gas , often in combinations with etching of the material .",
    "precise control of the number of electrons in the conduction band of a qd has been achieved in gaas heterostructures @xcite .",
    "an all - electrically controlled quantum dot array ( qda ) can be realized by electrodes confining single electrons to the dot regions , with the electron tunnel between neighboring dots being controlled by electrical gating @xcite .    as in the case of real clusters , electronic transport through qda s",
    "can be treated theoretically within a tight - binding framework @xcite .",
    "the tight - binding model has been used to study coulomb effects on qd transmittance @xcite , magnetoconductance in chaotic arrays @xcite , kondo resonances and fano antiresonances in transport @xcite , and transport through two - dimensional networks @xcite .",
    "a simplifying assumption treats a qd as a potential well , thus omitting a detailed account of its internal structure .",
    "this allows analytical results to be obtained for transport properties of qda s ( see for instance @xcite ) .    in this work we use the simple tight - binding approach to derive an analytical treatment of phase - coherent transport through a qda model composed of two different sets of qd s , as originally proposed by mardaani and esfarjani @xcite .",
    "we treat both a periodic and quasi - periodic arrangement of the two types of qd s in the array , and report comparative numerical illustrations of the density - of - states ( dos ) and of the transmittivity of these arrays for a number @xmath2 of qd s up to 100 .",
    "our analytical results allow us to evaluate very long arrays without any special numerical effort .",
    "specifically , we use a decimation - renormalization method  @xcite to reduce the qda to an effective dimer with renormalized site energies and hopping interactions , and supplement the method with a generalized kirkman - pendry relation @xcite to account for the connection of the qda to external metallic leads . the @xmath0-matrix formalism introduced in this paper for the calculation of the qda transmittivity is equivalent to the formalism given in ref .",
    "@xcite for out - of - equilibrium leads in the special case of an infinitesimal bias and is suitable to deal with renormalized effective hamiltonians describing very long chains .",
    "we use a one - dimensional ( 1d ) tight - binding hamiltonian to describe a qda of @xmath2 equally spaced potential wells .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath3 where the site energy @xmath4 corresponds to the energy level for an electron in the @xmath5-th well and @xmath6 is the hopping energy between the @xmath5-th and the @xmath7-th well .",
    "the connection to external leds will be added later .",
    "we focus on two types of qda s .",
    "the first is a periodic array in which two different types of qd s , @xmath8 and @xmath9 say , alternate . in the second the two kinds of qd s",
    "are arranged according to the fibonacci sequence , i.e. , if we define the first qd as @xmath10 and the second as @xmath11 , the rest of the chain is built by the rule @xmath12 .",
    "the schematic hamiltonians for these qda s are shown in fig .",

    "[ fig_schem ] ]    the related green s function at energy @xmath13 is @xmath14 here and below , we consider a complex energy variable defined as @xmath15 in the limit of vanishing positive imaginary part .",
    "to evaluate the dos @xmath16 we use the kirkman - pendry relation  @xcite , which relates the dos to the matrix element @xmath17 expressing coherence between the first and the last site of the qda , @xmath18 the matrix element @xmath17 can be evaluated by reducing the qda to an effective dimer through decimation of the intermediate qd s ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the renormalized array contains just the first and the last site and its hamiltonian is expressed as a @xmath19 matrix , @xmath20 here , the effective site and hopping energies can be obtained by the recursive relations @xmath21 and @xmath22 for @xmath23 , the initial values being given by the hamiltonian parameters namely @xmath24 and @xmath25 . by direct inversion of @xmath26 we obtain @xmath27 [ e-\\tilde{\\varepsilon}_n^{(n-2)}(e)]-[\\tilde{t}_{1,n}(e)]^2}.\\ ] ] we then use eq .",
