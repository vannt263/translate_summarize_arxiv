    "about 10% of radio quiet luminous quasars ( qsos ) exhibit broad absorption lines ( bal ) in the highly ionized resonant uv lines , such as nv , siiv and civ ( turnshek 1984 , weymann , 1995 ) .",
    "approximately 515% of these also show low ionization bal such as mgii , aliii ( weymann et al .",
    "1991 , hartig & baldwin 1990 , boroson & meyers 1992 , voit , weyman & korista 1993 ) .",
    "the bals are displaced to shorter wavelengths with velocities of up to 0.1c relative to their corresponding emission line peaks .",
    "this indicates the presence of partially ionized gas outflows at enormous velocities from the central nucleus in these objects .",
    "the bal qsos are either a unique type of objects or normal qsos viewed under special geometrical conditions .",
    "evidence in support of the latter interpretation includes the small covering factor inferred from the line profile modeling ( hamann et al .",
    "1993 ) and the similarity in the emission line spectra between bal and non - bal objects ( weymann et al .",
    "new spectro - polarimetric observations reveal that the bal region shows a disk - like structure and that the bal clouds are mixed with dust which , at least in some objects , effectively blocks part of the light from the innermost nucleus ( glenn , schmidt & foltz 1994 , goodrich & miller 1995,cohen et al .",
    "1995 , hines & wills 1995 ) .    blue - shifted , low velocity absorption lines are usually found in the iue spectra of @xmath815% of less luminous , low redshift , seyfert galaxies .",
    "variations of these absorption lines imply that they are also produced close to the nucleus , as are the bal clouds ( stocke et al .",
    "1994 and references therein ) .",
    "these absorption lines might represent the low velocity counterpart of the bal phenomenon in the less luminous seyfert nuclei .",
    "stocke et al .",
    "( 1994 ) proposed that the low velocities are the consequence of the comparatively low total power of seyfert galaxies .",
    "the uv spectrum of bal qsos has been extensively studied , while the x - ray spectra of these objects -potentially important to clarify a number of questions- have been poorly investigated .",
    "the unresolved absorption troughs in the uv may contain partially saturated lines , which can easily escape the detection in a moderate resolution spectrum .",
    "this is not a problem for the x - ray continuum , because the x - ray absorption is sensitive to the total absorbing column density in the bal region .",
    "part of the absorbing material might be highly ionized and produces only very weak absorption in the uv but much stronger absorption in x - rays .",
    "the total hydrogen column density inferred from the uv absorption lines is of the order @xmath810@xmath9",
    "@xmath10 , which is not high enough to produce significant x - ray absorption , however there exists some evidence for large x - ray absorption in bal objects .",
    "the x - ray emission of bal objects in the _ rosat _ band is generally extremely weak .",
    "only very few objects have been detected in soft x - rays ( green & mathur 1996 , wang , brinkmann & bergeron 1996 ) , with a broad band spectral index of @xmath11 for all of them .",
    "this suggests that the x - ray emission of bal qsos is either intrinsically weak or suppressed by absorption .",
    "the similarity in the emission line spectra of bal and non - bal qsos , and the detection of large x - ray absorption in two relative bright bal qsos ( green & mathur 1996 , mathur , elvis & singh 1996 ) suggest that absorption is common in these objects .",
    "some recent bal models predict the presence of significant x - ray absorption . to overcome the confinement problem ( c.f .",
    "weymann 1995 ) in radiative acceleration models for bal qso s , murray et al .",
    "( 1995 ) suggested that the bal gas is shielded by a very large column density ( 10@xmath1210@xmath13  @xmath10 ) of highly ionized gas , which absorbs the soft x - ray photons but not the ultraviolet photons .",
    "murray & chiang ( 1996 ) further extended these results to seyfert galaxies and radio - loud objects .",
    "absorbing column densities of a few times 10@xmath14  @xmath10 are predicted for seyfert galaxies and radio - loud quasars . although this model explains nicely the soft x - ray deficit in bal qsos , verification of this theory is largely dependent on the detection of the warm absorbing gas .",
    "the existence of thick absorber has been claimed for a few bal qsos , it has however not been demonstrated that the gas is highly ionized , as is essential for the validity of this theory .",
    "it should be noted that most low redshift seyfert galaxies with uv absorption lines do not show heavily absorbed x - ray spectra , i.e. , steep optical to x - ray spectrum , although about 50% of these objects do show some warm absorber associated features ( reynolds 1996 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we report the result of the detailed analysis of the ultraviolet and x - ray spectrum of the high redshift bal qso analogue , pg1126@xmath0041 ( mrk 1298 ) which is a high luminosity seyfert i galaxy ( @xmath15 , only slightly fainter than a typical quasar ) with weak x - ray emission ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "strong uv absorption , extending to a maximum velocity of about @xmath2 km  s@xmath3 , in civ , nv and siiv are present in the low resolution iue spectra .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "pspc spectrum shows strongly ionized absorption with a column density @xmath17  @xmath10 .",
    "two short - wavelength and one long wavelength spectrum were obtained with iue in june 1992 and one short wavelength spectrum in january 1995 .",
    "the spectra were retrieved from the iue archive and were processed with the iue newsips software , which also corrects thermal and temporal degradation of the camera sensitivity .",
    "they have been corrected for galactic reddening , which has been estimated from the galactic hydrogen column density @xmath18  @xmath10 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) with a conversion factor @xmath19  @xmath10 ( diplas & savage 1993 ) .",
    "all line and continuum measurements reported in this paper are based on the spectra corrected for the corresponding reddening of e(b - v ) = 0.08 .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the combined swp and lwp spectra of 1992 . emission and absorption lines are marked in the figure .",
    "the strong nv , civ and siiv absorption lines , at the short wavelength side of the emission lines , are pronounced .",
    "the short wavelength spectrum taken in 1995 ( swp53285 ) shows an increase in the continuum flux by a factor two ( see table  1 ) , much weaker absorption lines ( table  2 ) , and little variation in the emission lines .",
    "figure 2 shows details of the emission and absorption line profiles at both epochs .",
    "the 1992-spectrum is normalized to match the local continuum of the 1995 data for each line .",
    "firstly , we notice that civ emission line peaks to the red side of the line position in the object s rest frame ( z=0.060 ) , unlike the ly@xmath20 line , which peaks at zero velocity .",
    "this difference is most likely due to the strong absorption in civ .",
    "secondly , in the 1992 spectrum , the civ and nv absorption troughs are deeper than the local continuum , suggesting partial coverage of the absorbing material of the emission line region . in 1995 ,",
    "the absorption lines are much weaker and an additional large velocity civ absorption line is indicated .",
    "as the emission lines are relatively narrow , the continuum , which can normally only be defined with difficulty in bal qsos , can be reliably estimated from the pseudo - line free windows .",
    "the continuum over the full swp region is modeled with a single power law .",
    "emission lines are fitted by multiple gaussians : ly@xmath20   and civ are modeled with two gaussians with the relative central wavelengths and widths for each component fixed ; nv 1240 , siiv+oiv ] , heii , ciii ] and mgii are fitted with one gaussian and their central wavelengths are fixed at the observed wavelengths .    due to the low spectral resolution of iue , the detailed structure of the absorption lines can hardly be resolved .",
    "therefore we modeled each broad absorption line with one gaussian , applied to both the continuum and the emission line .",
    "the best fit parameters are derived by minimizing @xmath21  , taking into account the newsips errors .",
    "the fit is done using the specfit package developed by g. kriss within the distribution of stsdas .",
    "finally , the whole wavelength range of the swp camera from 1200   to 1930   is simultaneously fitted , allowing a reliable determination of both the continuum shape and the flux .",
    "the initial values were estimated by fitting each line separately over a 150   window centered on the observed emission line peak .",
    "only two strong absorption lines , nv and civ , were included in this first step .",
    "the weaker absorption lines in siiv and ly@xmath20 , are then added after a reasonable fit is achieved .",
    "the centre and width of the absorption lines in velocity space are locked to those of the civ absorption line . to avoid finding a local minimum ,",
    "a simplex search is used throughout the fitting process .    since a single power law continuum",
    "can not be defined over the full lwp band , due to contamination by uv feii and balmer continuum emission , we applied only local continuum fits , for ciii ] and mgii , over a window width of 300    centred on the observed wavelength of each line .",
    "the fit over the profile of the mgii line yields a line width 2430 km  s@xmath3 , similar to that of the h@xmath22 line , allowing for the separation of the doublet nature of mgii and the resolution of lwp camera .",
    "no mgii absorption line is visible .",
    "the final fit over the swp band is shown in fig 3 .",
    "the best fit parameters for the continuum are listed in table  1 for the emission lines and the continuum , and in table  2 for the absorption lines .",
    "the emission line flux is the sum of the individual components .",
    "the errors given in table  1 and table  2 are purely statistical at the 1@xmath23   level .",
    "since there exists no evidence for short time - scale uv variations in seyfert galaxies of comparable luminosity , the difference between the two spectra taken in 1992 can be regarded as an indicator for the errors introduced by the measurements and the calibration .",
    "the central velocity ( @xmath24 km@xmath3 ) and width ( 3000 km  s@xmath3 ) for the absorption lines from the different measurements are in good agreement .",
    "the equivalent widths of nv , siiv , and civ absorption lines as well as the fluxes of the ly@xmath20 , nv , siiv+oiv ] , and civ emission lines from the two spectra in 1992 are also within their statistical errors . the heii fluxes differ by a factor of two , but the heii line is badly blended with oiii]@xmath251663 , and forms a very broad feature , and the line flux depends critically on the exact value of the continuum placement . in the 1992 spectra a ly@xmath20   absorption line is required for spectrum swp44823 , but not for the other ( swp 44822 ) .    assuming optically thin conditions , column densities for the absorbing ions can be estimated from the above equivalent widths : @xmath26 , where @xmath25   and @xmath27   are the wavelength and oscillator strength of the corresponding absorption lines , _",
    "n _ is the column density of the absorbing ion and @xmath28   is the effective statistical weight for the ground level of the corresponding ion ( spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "@xmath29 values were taken from korista et al .",
    "( 1991 ) . if individual optically thick absorption lines are present or the absorbing material only partially covers the continuum or emission line region , the column densities derived represent lower limits .",
    "these column densities are given in table  2 under n@xmath30 .",
    "the overall continuum in the swp band is steep with a spectral index @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) similar to that seen in some low ionization bal qsos . if the intrinsic uv continuum of pg1126@xmath0041 is similar to other qsos ( francis et al .",
    "1991 ) , significant intrinsic reddening is required ( see the discussion for pg0043 + 039 by turnshek et al .",
    "however , the cold @xmath33 column density derived from the x - ray analysis can not provide sufficient reddening if the dust - to - gas ratio and the properties of the dust are galactic .",
    "moreover , the galactic 2200   absorption feature which is usually seen in similarly reddened objects , is weak .",
    "the rosat observation of pg 1126 - 041 was made overlapping in time with the iue observation in 1992 with an exposure time of @xmath34 20 ks , and can be considered to be simultaneous .",
    "the methods used in the x - ray spectral analysis , including source and background extraction , dead - time and vignetting correction , and spectral fitting are similar to those described in wang , brinkmann & bergeron ( 1996 ) .",
    "independent analysis using exsas ( wy ) and xselect plus xspec(tw ) gives essentially the same results .",
    "the results presented here in table  3 , are those obtained from xselect .",
    "all errors quoted , are at 2.7@xmath23 level for each single parameter of interest .",
    "although the net counts for the source are only about 320 , a single power law with galactic column fails to produce a reasonable fit ( @xmath35/d.o.f .",
    "=  4.00/10 ) leaving a deep and broad dip around 0.8 kev ( figure 4 ) . in addition , this fit yields a column density ( @xmath36  @xmath10 ) , some 10 times less than the galactic value , and a very flat spectrum @xmath37 .",
    "when the column density is fixed at the galactic value , the fit becomes much worse with @xmath38 . in this case the single power law description the uv to x - ray spectral index is 2.3@xmath390.1 , much steeper than for typical radio quiet qsos with a mean value 1.65 ( yuan et al . 1998 ) .    as the photon deficit around 0.8 - 1.0",
    "kev is a typical signature of warm absorption due to edges , more complicated models were applied . as a first step",
    ", a single absorption edge was added to the model .",
    "a good fit can be obtained with ( @xmath40 , table 3 ) .",
    "however , the edge energy of the best fit at 0.56@xmath390.03 kev does not correspond to any of the more common ion edges .",
    "this might be caused by the combination of several edges .",
    "to evaluate the results further , we next fitted the spectrum with a warm absorption model using a variable slope power - law ionizing continuum ( see zdziarski et al .",
    "the free parameters are photon index , column density , absorber temperature and ionization parameter ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "we have fixed the temperature at @xmath42  k and forced the photon index of ionizing continuum to be the same as the x - ray photon index .",
    "the best fit parameters are presented in table 3 .",
    "the fit is accepted at a confidence level of 23% ( @xmath43 , figure 4 ) .",
    "a small amount of excess cold absorption is also required with @xmath44  @xmath10 .",
    "figure 5 shows @xmath45 versus @xmath46 contours for the warm absorption model .",
    "the best fit column density @xmath47  @xmath10 for the absorbing material is within the range typically for seyfert i galaxies ( e.g. , reynolds 1997 ) .",
    "however , the ionization parameter is lower than normally found for other seyfert i galaxies . using the best fit photon index ,",
    "the x - ray derived dimensionless ionization parameter @xmath48_(density of ionizing photons in the energy @xmath49 0.1 kev)/(hydrogen density ) _",
    "( netzer 1996 ) is only 0.086@xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "after correcting for the warm absorption , the far uv to x - ray spectral slope becomes 1.66@xmath52 , which is consistent with the x - ray spectral index @xmath53 and well within the range of the mean value for radio quiet agns .",
    "in figure 6 we show the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of pg 1126 - 041 from infrared to x - ray energies .",
    "the sed peaks around 3000   and is flat in the infrared and optical band .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the far uv spectrum is steep and consistent with a direct extrapolation of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "barvainis ( 1993 ) interpreted the flatness of the infrared to optical spectrum in this object as contamination of stellar light which fills the gap between the spectral bumps .",
    "however , the steep uv spectrum can not be explained in this way since the contribution of stellar light in the far uv is negligible under any reasonable assumption for the stellar population . an alternative method to generate",
    "such steep uv spectra is through significant dust absorption .",
    "we will show below that this is also an unlikely cause for the steep spectrum .    if the intrinsic uv spectrum of pg1126 - 041 is similar to other qsos a reddening of e(b - v )",
    "@xmath490.15 is required . however , the balmer decrement in this object is normal , with a ratio h@xmath20/h@xmath22 = 2.92 ( miller et al .",
    "1992 ) , very close to that expected for case b recombination , and it is also similar to the mean value of h@xmath20/h@xmath22 = 3.07@xmath390.56 as determined for a sample of bright qsos with z@xmath54 by miller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) . using the h@xmath20 flux of 8.92  10@xmath55  erg  @xmath10  s@xmath3",
    ", we find from the @xmath7 flux in table 1 , that for pg1126 - 041 the ratio @xmath56 is between 2.3 and 3.6 , for the two epochs of iue observations in 1992 and 1995 .",
    "as this is already very close to the photoionization prediction of @xmath56 @xmath344.0 , it is clear that reddening can not bring the flux at 1200   up much more than a factor of two at most , arguing against the existence of large reddening affecting the emission lines .",
    "as any absorbed uv light must be re - emitted in the infrared band , the infrared luminosity due to the dust emission must be a factor of two larger than the observed luminosity in the uv if the dust covers a large fraction of the nucleus and the reddening is as large as e(b - v)=0.15 .",
    "the observed integrated infrared flux in the 1 - 100@xmath57 band is 5.6@xmath58  erg  @xmath10  s@xmath59 , which is similar to the integrated uv flux from 3000  to 100   of 5.7@xmath58  erg  @xmath10  s@xmath3 for the 1992 data .",
    "in addition a significant portion of infrared emission has to originate from the host galaxy .",
    "finally , the shortage of soft x - ray photons would even be more severe if the uv spectrum were highly reddened . with a e(b - v)=0.15 correction applied to the uv spectrum",
    ", the uv flux will increase by a factor of four , bringing @xmath60 back to @xmath61 , making the object intrinsically very weak in x - rays .",
    "also , the absence of a strong 2200   feature implies that the grains must be different from the standard galactic composition .",
    "although we can not completely rule out the possibility of that reddening is responsible for the steep uv spectrum , it requires a number of rather restrictive constraints : 1 ) the dust covers only a small fraction of the blr ; ( 2 ) the grains are not of galactic composition , ( 3 ) the x - ray emission is intrinsically weak . on the other hand , the uv spectrum of an object with uv absorption lines could very well be intrinsically steep",
    ". this can be associated for example , with inclination effects .",
    "the case of an intrinsically steep spectrum will be discussed in the next section .",
    "we have shown above that , in addition to the highly ionized uv absorption lines of nv , civ and siiv , also strong ionized absorption is detected in the soft x- ray spectrum . since both the uv and x - ray ionized absorber are photoionized in qsos ( weymann 1994 , netzer 1993 , ross & fabian 1993),we will present in this section , photoionization calculations using 90 version cloudy ( ferland 1997 ) .",
    "the results of these calculations will be used to constrain the physical conditions of the x - ray absorbing material .",
    "solar abundances are assumed throughout although some earlier evidence suggests the existence of a possible heavy element overabundance in the bal gas(turnshek 1995 ) .",
    "cloudy90 uses a plane parallel slab geometry for the region .",
    "mathur et al . (",
    "1994 ) have shown that one should use the actually observed sed of an agn in the application of photoionization codes , rather than a typical quasar sed .",
    "therefore , we take the observed infrared to x - ray spectrum of pg 1126 - 041 as shown in figure 6 , corrected for galactic reddening of @xmath62 in the optical and uv and for the ionized absorption in the x - ray band . the euv spectrum is a linear interpolation from the far uv to the soft x - rays in @xmath63 versus @xmath64 space .",
    "to predict the uv absorption lines from the parameters of the warm absorber obtained in  3 , we have calculated a series of models for gas ionized by the continuum of pg 1126 - 041 .",
    "first , the ionization parameter @xmath45 is converted to a dimensionless _ u= ( density of photons at e@xmath65 ev)/ ( hydrogen density ) _ . for @xmath66 ,",
    "we find @xmath67 .",
    "the models cover the parameter range for the warm absorber , indicated by the probability distribution shown in figure 5 of @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the resulting predicted logarithmic column densities ( in @xmath10 ) are 16.11@xmath71 , 15.23@xmath72 , 15.95@xmath73 , @xmath74 for the hi , civ , nv and siiv respectively .",
    "the uncertainties correspond to the minimum and maximum taken for the above parameter range . although the models reproduce the observed civ and nv column densities correctly ( _ cf .",
    "_ table  2 ) , the ly@xmath20 absorption is far too strong . under the optically thin assumption",
    ", the above hi column density corresponds to a @xmath75 , which is a factor of 20 stronger than observed . since the predicted hi column density is at least a factor of two larger than that of nv , in the optically thick case the @xmath76 should be similar to that of @xmath77 .",
    "such strong absorption in the ly@xmath20 is clearly not present in the data .",
    "also , the model predicts that siiv absorption should not be observable and @xmath78 , which would imply either , that nv is partially saturated , or that the abundances of c and n are different from the solar value .",
    "if the uv absorption lines are produced by an additional gas component , the weakness of the ly@xmath20 absorption line can be used to constrain the turbulent velocity within the absorber . by requiring that the @xmath79 produced by the warm absorber material should not be larger than the observed value",
    ", we can derive an upper limit on the turbulent velocity ( _ b _ ) of the absorbing material .",
    "the curve - of - growth of the ly@xmath20 absorption line shown in figure 7 illustrates that , in order to be consistent with @xmath80 , the turbulent velocity within the warm absorber must be less than 190 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "this limit is far in excess of the expected thermal velocity of ions .",
    "however , a large velocity gradient within the absorber is predicted in some models , which identify the warm absorber with an accretion disk wind . since",
    "warm absorption features are dominated by the absorption edges of metal ions , the required total hydrogen column density will be less if the metal abundances are much higher than the solar value , but this gives only a marginal relaxation of the constraint on the turbulent velocity .",
    "for example , if the hi column density is lowered by a factor of 10 , i.e. the metal abundances are increased by a factor of @xmath810 , the upper limit of _ b _ will be increased by a factor of two at most , to 300 km  s@xmath3 ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "the soft x - ray spectral fit indicates additional absorption due to cold ( neutral or low ionized ) material , but little constraints on the ionization state can be obtained from the x - ray data .",
    "it is likely that part of the uv absorption line is produced by this relatively cold material .",
    "it appears that low column , cold material is located outside the warm absorber and thus the ionizing continuum passes through the warm absorber before striking this material . to model this component",
    ", we use the above continuum transmitted through the warm absorbing material inferred from the x - ray spectral fitting in the last section .",
    "we assume a particle density @xmath81 @xmath82 , and the calculations stop at a column density of @xmath83@xmath10 .",
    "the column densities for a few uv absorbing ions are shown in figure 7 .",
    "it is clear that this model still predicts too strong ly@xmath20 absorption . for a wide range of ionization parameters ,",
    "the model predicts @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , the c and n must be a few times over - abundant in the absorbing material in order to explain the weak ly@xmath20 absorption .",
    "moreover , for an ionization parameter range in which @xmath85 , the siiv column density is very low , and the observed @xmath79 implies that si should also have a high abundance .",
    "this situation is similar to that found for bal qsos ( e.g. , junkkarinen , burbidge & smith 1987 , hamann 1998 ) .",
    "the change in the absorption equivalent widths between two observations could be due to the fact that either the ionization of the uv absorber is higher in 1995 or , if there is a non - radial velocity component and the structure is not symmetric , the absorber moves out of the line of sight .    using the scaling law for the blr size , @xmath86 , and taking ngc5548 as a calibrator , the blr size in pg 1126 - 041 is estimated to be @xmath87 cm .",
    "since the uv absorber is outside of the blr , the minimal radius can be set to @xmath88 cm .",
    "if the absorber is an expanding shell of cloudlets with a radial velocity @xmath89 km / s ( see table 3 ) , the distance of the absorber to the center has increased by @xmath90  cm , which is about 0.1  @xmath91 , from 1992 to 1995 .",
    "as the absorber is likely in pressure balance with the hot medium , over such small distances the decrease of the pressure should be small .",
    "therefore , the density of the absorber is similar for the two epochs , and we estimate that the ionization parameter in 1995 is about a factor of two higher than in 1992 . a factor of two increase in _ u _ is also expected if the absorbing material is in steady outflow from the accretion disk .",
    "the column density of an ion is proportional to the square of the ew of the absorption line if the line is severely saturated , and proportional to the ew in the optically thin case . as seen in figure 8 , in the range of @xmath85 ,",
    "an increase of u by a factor of two will lead to a factor of 2 - 3 drop in the n v column density and 3 - 4 in the civ column density .",
    "this suggest that the absorption lines may not be severely saturated in the spectrum obtained in 1992 .      in order to see if the ionizing continuum illuminating the belr also passes through the ionized absorption region ,",
    "we have computed the emission line spectra for two incident ionizing continua , with and without filtered by warm absorption . a typical column density of @xmath92  @xmath10 and a particle density of @xmath93  @xmath82 are adopted . in figure 9",
    ", we plot the ratios of line emissivities ( the line flux per unit surface area on the cloud surface ) generated by these two input ionizing continua for a wide range of the ionization parameter .",
    "the figure shows that the emissivity of most lines is lower if the continuum is absorbed by warm material .",
    "this simply reflects the fact that the heating rate decreases due to the absorption of soft x - ray photons by the warm absorber .",
    "the drop is particularly large for o vi and nv lines , whose emission strongly depends on the soft x - ray spectrum . for these two lines ,",
    "the suppression of nv@xmath251240 and ovi@xmath251032 relative to ly@xmath20 is a factor of four and @xmath4910 for a typical blr ionization parameter u@xmath341 .",
    "this supplies a very sensitive test of whether the ionizing continuum passes through the warm absorber before striking the blr clouds if precise measurement of more emission lines are available . however , ovi is not observed by iue and the nv emission is sensitive to the abundance as well .",
    "nevertheless , future more sensitive observations will enable us to perform such analyses .",
    "we have analyzed the uv and x - ray spectra of the x - ray weak agn pg 1126 - 041 and found : + ( 1 ) the uv spectra show strong highly ionized absorption lines in nv , civ and siiv , which extend over a velocity range from @xmath1 to more than @xmath2 km  s@xmath3 from the corresponding emission line center .",
    "the absorption column density ratios for metal lines are similar to those found in bal qsos .",
    "the equivalent widths of civ and nv absorption lines have changed by a factor of two over a period of 2.5 yrs .",
