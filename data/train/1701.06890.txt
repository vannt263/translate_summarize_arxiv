    "+ inflation can be well - defined by a quasi de sitter expansion in which the de sitter expansion is not accurate . because of this , statistic of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuation is nearly gaussian , also the power spectrum of fluctuations is almost scale invariant and almost statistically isotropic .",
    "therefore , we have to look at fine structures of the cmb fluctuation , such as non - gaussianity which is a result of violation of translational symmetry and does nt appear in the simplest single field inflaton with a canonical action @xcite-@xcite , spectral tilt as a result of violation of the temporal part of the de sitter symmetry which is characterized by a slow - roll parameter , and statistical anisotropy which means spatial part of the de sitter symmetry is not exact @xcite .",
    "although deviation from gaussianity , scale invariance and statistical isotropy are quite small , they are observationally corroborated by planck and wmap @xcite-@xcite .",
    "+ some anomalies in the cmb are of great importance @xcite , @xcite .",

    ", there is hemispherical power asymmetry ( dipolar or quadrupole power asymmetry ) .",
    "despite the fact that the statistical significance of hemispherical power asymmetry is hard to quantify ( especially for the case quadrupole ) , researchers has been prompting to give variety of models , which have been put forward to explain this phenomenon @xcite-@xcite .",
    "+ the first attempt to put constraints on a preferred direction during inflation , and to make robust predictions for its observable consequence and its magnitude , was done by ackerman _",
    "they considered the most general form of the power spectrum ( in which rotational invariance has violated ) as follows , @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the power spectrum for the primordial density perturbations @xmath3 and depends only on the magnitude of the vector * k*. also , @xmath4 is the privileged direction by which rotational invariance is broken .",
    "moreover , @xmath5 characterizes the deviation from the isotropy .",
    "the obtained bound using wmap data is @xmath6 @xcite . a later analysis based on planck data gave the best constraint i.e. @xmath7 so far @xcite .",
    "the planck team got very similar constraints @xcite . + an inflationary theory can accommodate models that produce hemispherical power asymmetry .",
    "anisotropic inflation is categorized as multifield inflation models .",
    "it contains a vector field led to a breaking of statistical isotropy .",
    "so the power spectrum for the primordial density perturbations becomes statistically anisotropic . in this model",
    "the inflaton field @xmath8 is coupled to the gauge kinetic term in the form @xmath9 in the bianchi type i ( bi ) space .",
    "there exists an attractor behavior for the solution and the vector field survives during inflation .",
    "also , it is free from the ghost @xcite .",
    "this model has been studied extensively in the literature @xcite-@xcite . breaking the rotational invariance during inflation , in which we call it anisotropy ,",

    "it is shown in @xcite that for the bound from planck , anisotropy is less than @xmath10 .",

    "+ the prototype of an alternative to einstein s general relativity was done by brans and dicke .",
    "the primary motivation for their theory comes from mach s principle , that the phenomenon of inertia ought to arise from accelerations with respect to the general mass distribution of the universe @xcite .",
    "brans - dicke ( bd ) theory is an important branch of the extended theories of gravity in the scalar - tensor theories . in bd theory , however , the gravitational coupling is variable .",
    "it is determined by all matter in the universe , accordingly , a scalar field is considered to couple to the ricci curvature nonminimally .",
    "in spite of declining of interest in bd gravity in the 70s , a surge interest has raised owing to the new importance of scalar fields in unified theories , in particular string theory .",
    "another reason for this interest is discovering plausible mechanisms that allow the parameter @xmath0 ( a variable in the bd gravity ) to get values of order unity in the early universe and diverge later @xcite .",
    "finally the using of scalar tensor gravity theories in inflationary scenarios of the universe , has renewed interest in bd gravity @xcite-@xcite . + this paper",
    "is organized as follows . in section [ s:2 ] ,",
    "the general action of anisotropic inflation in scalar tensor gravity is provided .",
    "then , the most general equations of motion is obtained . in section [ s:3 ] ,",
    "anisotropic brans - dicke inflation is considered , and anisotropy is obtained in the terms of the slow roll parameters .",
    "also , a relation for the phase transition is obtained . in section [ s:4 ] , numerical calculation is obtained for a specific potential .",

    "<S> we study anisotropic inflation in the brans - dicke gravity in the presence of an abelian gauge field where the gauge field is non - minimally coupled to the inflaton . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the degree of anisotropy , under slow - roll approximations , is proportional to slow - roll parameter of the theory . as a demonstration , we consider the displaced quadratic potential for the inflation . </S>",
    "<S> we do the numerical calculation of the model to investigate the behavior of anisotropy by changing the parameter in the brans - dicke model . </S>",
    "<S> we find out that , the solution is an attractor in the phase space , and anisotropy grows before the end of inflation . </S>",
