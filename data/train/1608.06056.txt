    "@xcite ) has widely encouraged the study of topological invariants in solid state systems.@xcite this has also contributed to the inception of many new physical concepts such as thouless - kohmoto - nightingale - den nijs ( tknn ) invariants,@xcite composite fermions,@xcite and also raised the hope for the realization of many non - abelian ` particles ' in the condensed matter setups.@xcite subsequently , quantum spin - hall ( qsh)@xcite and quantum anomalous hall ( qah)@xcite states were realized in which hall current arises in the absence of external magnetic field . in both cases",
    "transverse spin current arises from the chiral spin - orbit entanglement with and without time - reversal symmetry , respectively . in these two subclasses , density - functional theory ( dft )",
    "has taken the preceding role in predicting suitable materials , which were followed by experimental realizations .",
    "the fascinating interplay between topological , magnetic and transport properties of qah effects has tremendous scientific and technological interests .",
    "therefore , the discovery of single - crystal qah insulators with intrinsic long - range magnetization is considered imperative .",
    "most of the search for qah materials have so far been within the two - dimensional ( 2d ) qsh , or thin - films of topological insulators .",
    "the idea here is to suppress one of their chiral spin current by inducing ferromagnetic ( fm ) state through impurity , doping or proximity effect .",
    "this guideline has led to the predictions of a variety of materials within the magnetically doped graphene,@xcite qsh systems,@xcite thin films of topological insulators,@xcite quantum well states of weyl semimetal hgcr@xmath2se@xmath3,@xcite and related materials ( a comprehensive list of the predicted qah materials is provided in table  [ tab : mat ] ) .",
    "thin films of topological insulators are synthesized to date to exhibit qah effect with magnetic impurities.@xcite however , so far there is no single crystal with innate magnetic order and spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) know to be qah insulator .",
    "we begin by considering the vast possibility of magnetic materials with strong soc , and narrow down the list by eliminating the choices via crystal structure selection , absence of continuous magnetic transition , or impurity prone lattice etc . by using density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations , we find that the fm la@xmath0 ( @xmath0=br , cl , and i ) is a layered material class which exhibits band crossing between different orbitals and opposite spins at a momenta contour near the fermi level without soc.@xcite as soc is switched on , the ` inverted ' insulating band gap opens in labr , lacl and lai , but not in laf , endowing the former systems into the uncharted territory of intrinsic qah insulators . to understand and characterize these properties , we have also formulated a realistic tight - binding model and estimated the qah index via berry curvature computation .",
    "labr and lacl are also found to be flexible for enhancing their band gap via small strain .",
    "much like how bi- and sb- based binary topological insulators provided the breakthrough for the discovery and predictions of many related materials and their ternary and quaternary variants , our prediction provides a guiding principle for manipulating and expanding the ` bulk ' and intrinsic qah insulator classes in related materials .",
    "the reminder of this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mat ] , we describe the materials selection process for the qah insulators .",
    "the corresponding first - principles band structure calculation for la@xmath0 family is performed in sec .",

    "candidate materials for bulk qah insulators may be sought in compounds where ( 1 ) magnetism and soc can be intrinsically present ; ( 2 ) the magnetic transition is continuous with temperature , or otherwise the magnetic interactions would often not be long - ranged ; ( 3 ) a stable non - high symmetric lattice structure which would have higher propensity towards band inversion@xcite ; and ( 4 ) single crystal growth would be feasible with clear surface state , where dopant or impurity scattering can be made sufficiently small to achieve large values of transport properties",
    ".    simple candidates may include @xmath4-electron ferromagnets in the heavy - element compounds , or intercalated with heavy - elements for sufficiently large soc .",
    "but these systems often have cubic or tetragonal lattice , and in some cases , lack inversion symmetry which sometimes reduces the band inversion strength.@xcite similar complication arises in simple @xmath4-electron antiferromagnets in which , moreover , the magnetic transitions are sometimes not continuous . in addition , much of these systems suffer from the problems of impurity and low transport properties .",
    "more promising candidates can be expected within the actinide and lanthanide compounds .",
    "actinides have larger soc strength . but",
    "due to larger bandwidth of 5@xmath5 states , the interaction strength decreases and they often escapes magnetism .",
    "more importantly , radioactive materials suffer from radiation induced defects .",
    "we then consider lanthanide based rear - earth elements .",
    "their low - energy spectrum remain poised between the @xmath4- and @xmath5- electronic configurations , which make them versatile for commencing diverse materials properties . among the rear - earth elements , lanthanum ( la ) provides the common element for materials with properties as diverse as half - huesler topological insulators,@xcite colossal magnetoresistance,@xcite metal - insulator transition,@xcite as well as high - temperature superconductivity.@xcite therefore , la is a good candidate element to search for large gap intrinsic qah effect .    for the anion element",
    ", we consider halogen elements because of their high electronegativity which enables strong chemical bonding with la cations .",
    "furthermore , halogen elements form very weak bonds within the diatonic ( @xmath6 ) element , raising the possibility for obtaining layered systems with topological consequences . our search by dft calculations indeed yielded in a stable compounds la@xmath0 ( @xmath0=br , cl , and i ) , which belong to the rhombohedral crystal structure with the space group @xmath7 and point group @xmath8 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , the structure is characterized by a sequence of triangular network layers composed of la and @xmath0 atoms .",
    "each bilayer has two inequivalent la atoms ( denoted by ` a ' and ` b ' layers ) arranged in patterns as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "all such bilayers are related to each other by inversion symmetry along the @xmath9-axis , and the inter - bilayer interaction arises from the weak van - der waals interaction and is thus considerably small .",

    "we have also explored a large range of @xmath10=0 to 8  ev , and the results remain characteristically the same .",
    "moreover , the band structure is reproduced with other functionals including the local density approximation ( lda ) + u , the van der waals ( vdw)-density functional ( df ) [ optb86b - vdw functional ] method@xcite and the hybrid functional hse06  @xcite .",

    "both the phonon dispersion and formation energy show that la@xmath0 compounds are stable . finally , given the valency of la ion being three ,",
    "the natural compound to expect is la@xmath16.@xcite therefore , relative stabilities of the multiphase system are analyzed by comparing their formation enthalpies . here , the formation enthalpy of la@xmath0 is found to differ only slightly from that of la@xmath16 , and thus the former sample can also be grown easily .",

    "the fm order , oriented perpendicular to the la - layers , is mediated by direct exchange interactions .",

    "the local crystal field environment of the la ion leads to large splitting between the @xmath18 and @xmath19 states , and two partially filled @xmath18 orbitals osculate the fermi level , with an overlapping semi - metallic like band structure .    in the fm state ,",
    "strong hund s coupling leads to spin splittings of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 orbitals .",

    "the insulating band gap can be enhanced to above 75 mev .",
    "as the band gap opens at the inverted bands crossing points via soc , qah effect can be expected in such systems .      guided by the dft band structure , we derive a realistic tight - binding model by including the two low - lying @xmath18 orbitals .",
    "the fm ordering is introduced by the mean - field heisenberg term , in which we allow exchange couplings to be orbital dependent ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) .",
    "the inter - orbital soc is restricted to be nearest neighbor , which turns out to have a form of @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the soc coupling strength .",
