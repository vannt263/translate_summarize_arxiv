    "the recent observation of high linear polarization during the prompt @xmath0-ray emission of grb 021206 ( coburn & boggs 2003 ) suggests that grbs be driven by highly magnetized , rapidly rotating compact objects .",
    "two popular scenarios for their birth are the merger of a compact binary or the collapse of a massive star ( for a recent review see mszros 2002 ) . in both scenarios ,",
    "a rapidly rotating black hole surrounded by an accretion disk seems to be a common remnant ( narayan , paczyski & piran 1992 ; woosley 1993 ; mszros & rees 1997a ; paczyski 1998 ) .",
    "however , a millisecond magnetar has also been argued as an alternative interesting product ( usov 1992 ; duncan & thompson 1992 ; kluniak & ruderman 1998 ; dai & lu 1998 ; spruit 1999 ; ruderman , tao & kluniak 2000 ; wheeler et al .",
    "2000 ) . to explain the complex temporal feature , the burst itself , in some of these energy models ,",
    "is understood to arise from a series of explosive reconnection events in a rising , amplified magnetic field because of the parker instability .",
    "this in fact dissipates the differentially rotational energy and magnetic energy of the newborn magnetar or accretion disk .",
    "after the grb , the remaining object is reasonably assumed to be a millisecond magnetar or a rapidly rotating black hole surrounded by an accretion disk . for the latter object , the magnetic field in the disk could have been amplified initially by differential rotation to a magnetar - like strength of @xmath1 g , and particularly , within the framework of the collapsar / hypernova model , such a field could be kept , due to longevity ( with days or longer ) of the disk maintained by fallback of the ejecta . during the afterglow",
    ", the object at the center will directly lose its rotational energy by the magnetic dipole radiation or the blandford - znajek mechanism .    an energy outflow driven",
    "magnetically includes three components : low - frequency electromagnetic waves , a relativistic wind , and a toroidal magnetic field associated with the wind .",
    "the wind energy flux is unlikely to be baryon - dominated , because the initial explosion should have left a clean passage with very few baryon contamination for a subsequent outflow .",
    "the interaction of this outflow with an outward - expanding fireball implies a continuous injection of the stellar rotational energy into the fireball .",
    "dai & lu ( 1998 , 2000 ) , zhang & mszros ( 2001 ) and chang , lee & yi ( 2002 ) discussed the evolution of a relativistic fireball by assuming a pure electromagnetic - wave energy outflow , while rees & mszros ( 1998 ) , sari & mszros ( 2000 ) , zhang & mszros ( 2002 ) , and granot , nakar & piran ( 2003 ) took into account a variable and baryon - dominated injection .",
    "however , based on the successful models of the well - observed crab nebula ( rees & gunn 1974 ; kennel & coroniti 1984 ; begelman & li 1992 ; chevalier 2000 ) , a realistic , continuous outflow during the afterglow is expected to be ultra - relativistic and dominated by the energy flux of electron - positron pairs . as in the crab nebula , even if an outflow from the pulsar is poynting - flux - dominated at small radii , the fluctuating component of the magnetic field in this outflow can be dissipated by magnetic reconnection and used to accelerate the outflow , which is eventually dominated by the energy flux of e@xmath2e@xmath3 pairs within a larger radius @xmath4 cm ( coroniti 1990 ; michel 1994 ; kirk & skjraasan 2003 ) . in the case of an afterglow , therefore , it is natural to expect that the central object still produces an ultra - relativistic e@xmath2e@xmath3-pair wind , whose interaction with the fireball leads to a relativistic wind bubble .",
    "this can be regarded as _ a relativistic version of the crab nebula_.    in this paper , we explore the dynamics of such a wind bubble and its emission signatures . in ",
    "2 we present expressions of the luminosity of a relativistic wind from a highly magnetized , rapidly rotating object . in   3 and 4 we discuss evolution of the wind bubble and temporal features of the radiation respectively . in the final section",
    "we summarize our findings and give a brief discussion on implications of the bubble .",
    "we assume that a burst itself arises from a series of explosive reconnection events . after the grb",
    ", we are left with a highly magnetized , rapidly rotating compact object .",
    "let s first assume that it is a millisecond magnetar with period @xmath5 , surface magnetic field strength @xmath6 , moment of inertia @xmath7 , radius @xmath8 , and angle between the rotation axis and magnetic dipole moment @xmath9 .",
    "since such a pulsar loses its rotational energy through the magnetic dipole torque , the luminosity of a resulting relativistic wind is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "because of spin - down , this luminosity will evolve with time as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the observer time in units of day , @xmath16 days is the  initial \" spin - down timescale of the magnetar at the onset of the afterglow , @xmath17 is the rotation period at this time , and @xmath18 .",
    "usov ( 1992 ) also assumed that the early spin - down could be due to gravitational wave radiation besides magnetic dipole radiation .",
    "however , the luminosity for gravitational wave radiation depends on the stellar ellipticity which is poorly known , and so we neglected the effect of this mechanism on spin - down .",
    "we now discuss another case in which the central object is a rapidly rotating black hole surrounded by an accretion disk .",
    "if the amplified magnetic field in the disk does not evolve significantly with time during fallback of the ejecta , the rotational energy of this black hole will be gradually extracted by the blandford - znajek mechanism , whose luminosity is approximated by @xmath19 where @xmath20^{1/2}\\simeq a^2/8 $ ] for the rotation parameter @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the black - hole mass , and @xmath23 is the disk field strength in units of @xmath24 g ( lee , wijers & brown 2000 ) .",
    "we note that a typical value ( @xmath25 ) of the wind luminosity in equations ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) has been invoked by rees & mszros ( 2000 ) to explain the observed iron lines from some grbs within the framework of the collapsar / hypernova model . considering the rotational energy of the black hole @xmath26 for @xmath21 ( lee et al .",
    "2000 ) , and assuming @xmath27 , we find that the blandford - znajek mechanism yields spin - down , similarly to the magnetar case , if the accreted angular momentum is neglected because its rate seems to be below the torque driven by the blandford - znajek mechanism at time of days after the burst for typical parameters in the collapsar / hypernova model .",
    "thus , we obtain a crude evolution law of the above luminosity , @xmath28 where @xmath29 days is the  initial \" spin - down time of the black hole and @xmath30 is the  initial \" rotation parameter .",
    "one can easily see that equations ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) are similar , which implies that our discussion of a relativistic wind bubble in the remaining text for magnetars should be valid for black holes .",
    "similarly to the crab nebula , a rotating magnetar at the center of an afterglow generates a highly relativistic wind dominated by the energy flux of e@xmath2e@xmath3 pairs , with bulk lorentz factor of @xmath31 .",
    "atoyan ( 1999 ) argued that the crab pulsar initially had @xmath32 to interpret the measured radio spectrum of the crab nebula .",
    "we adopt @xmath33 as a fiducial value in our calculations .",
    "because @xmath34 is much larger than the lorentz factor of the medium swept up by the fireball , this wind passes through a shock front and decelerates to match the expansion velocity of the swept - up medium .",
    "therefore , a relativistic wind bubble , as a result of interaction of the wind with the medium , should include two shocks : a reverse shock that propagates into the cold wind and a forward shock that propagates into the ambient medium .",
    "thus , there are four regions separated in the bubble by these shocks : ( 1 ) the unshocked medium , ( 2 ) the forward - shocked medium , ( 3 ) the reverse - shocked wind gas , and ( 4 ) the unshocked cold wind , where regions 2 and 3 are separated by a contact discontinuity . for simplicity",
    ", we here assume that two initially - forming forward shocks during interactions of the fireball both with the medium and with the wind have eventually merged to one forward shock , and also neglect effects of the baryon loading whose mass is much less than the swept - up mass , when the observer time far exceeds the initial deceleration timescale .",
    "we denote @xmath35 and @xmath36 as the baryon number density and pressure of region  @xmath37 \" in its own rest frame respectively , and @xmath38 is the lorentz factor of region  @xmath37 \" measured in the local medium s rest frame .",
    "we derive the relative lorentz factor of region 3 measured in the rest frame of region 4 as @xmath39 for @xmath40 , implying a relativistic reverse shock .",
    "because the electron number density in the rest frame comoving with the unshocked wind is @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 is the radius of region 3 and @xmath43 is the electron mass ) , according to the jump conditions for a relativistic shock ( blandford & mckee 1976 ) , the pressure of region 3 is calculated by @xmath44    neglecting the presence of the reverse shock and the radiative energy loss of region 2 , and assuming an ambient interstellar medium with constant density of @xmath45 , the properties of the shocked medium in region 2 should satisfy the blandford - mckee adiabatic self - similarity solution with the similarity variable at any radius @xmath42 , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the lorentz factor of the shocked medium just behind the forward shock whose radius is denoted as @xmath48 , and @xmath49 $ ] is the time measured in the local medium s rest frame .",
    "the radius @xmath42 can thus be expressed as function of @xmath50 by @xmath51 which implies @xmath52 as long as @xmath53 for an ultrarelativistic forward shock .",
    "this justifies the _ thin - shell approximation _ ,",
    "in which the width of region 2 is insignificant as compared to the shock radius @xmath48 .    according to blandford & mckee ( 1976 ) ,",
    "the pressure and lorentz factor of the shocked medium at radius @xmath42 are given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the proton mass .",
    "along the contact discontinuity , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which yield @xmath58 @xmath59 where the thin - shell approximation @xmath52 has been considered . for an ultrarelativistic",
    ", adiabatic forward shock , blandford & mckee ( 1976 ) found its total energy , @xmath60 in deriving the temporal laws of the similarity variable at the location of the contact discontinuity and the lorentz factors of regions 2 and 3 , we should note one crucial effect that the photons that are radiated from regions 2 and 3 at the same time in the local medium s rest frame will be detected at different observer times .",
    "this is because the lorentz factor of region 3 is smaller than @xmath61 by a factor of @xmath62 so that for a same time interval in the local medium s rest frame , @xmath63 , the emission from region 3 will reach the observer at time , @xmath64 and the emission from region 2 will reach the observer at time , @xmath65    using equations ( 12 ) and ( 14 ) , the lorentz factor of the shocked medium ( i.e. , region 2 ) just behind the forward shock is found to evolve with time as @xmath66 from equations ( 10)-(13 ) , we have the similarity variable at the location of the contact discontinuity , @xmath67 and the lorentz factor of region 3 , @xmath68^{1/8}\\nonumber \\\\ & = & 5.3l_{w,47}^{3/34}e_{52}^{5/136}n_1^{-1/8}t^{-39/136}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath45 and @xmath15 are in units of @xmath71 and 1 day respectively .",
    "letting @xmath72 , we define a critical time @xmath73 at this time , the injection energy to the fireball significantly exceeds its initial energy . for @xmath74 , the similarity variable @xmath75 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the dynamics denoted by equation ( 17 ) is simply calculated by equating the pressures of the two - sided shocked fluids at the contact discontinuity . in this derivation , we have neglected any work done on region 2 by region 3 because the pressure of region 3 is much less than @xmath76 at @xmath74 .",
    "once the observer s time exceeds @xmath77 , the similarity variable @xmath72 . at this stage , the total kinetic energy of region 2 is approximated as @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the swept - up medium mass .",
    "energy conservation requires that any increase of kinetic energy of region 2 should be equal to work done by region 3 , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the volume change of region 3 in its own rest frame . since regions 2 and 3 should keep velocity equality along the contact discontinuity ( viz . , @xmath82 )",
    ", we rewrite equation ( 19 ) as @xmath83}{2\\gamma_2m_{\\rm sw}c^2}.\\ ] ] considering equation ( 5 ) and the shock radius @xmath84 , the solution of equation ( 20 ) becomes @xmath85 where the dependence of @xmath86 on @xmath15 is consistent with the one derived for a pure electromagnetic energy injection by dai & lu ( 1998 ) .",
    "we next discuss the dynamics of a relativistic wind bubble : in the case of @xmath87 ( viz . , @xmath88 )",
    ", the wind bubble should evolve based on equations ( 15 ) and ( 17 ) ; for @xmath89 ( viz . , @xmath90 ) , however , the lorentz factors of the wind bubble decay initially as @xmath91 and @xmath92 at @xmath74 ( stage i ) , subsequently as @xmath93 at @xmath94 ( stage ii ) , and finally again as @xmath95 at @xmath96 ( stage iii ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that this discussion assumes a negligible radiative loss of region 3",
    ". however , no matter whether region 3 is at stage i or ii , and once it enters the fast cooling regime at some time , its pressure will begin to become much smaller than that of region 2 and then the lorentz factor of region 2 will decay as equation ( 15 ) .",
    "in this section we discuss light curves of the emission from a relativistic wind bubble , assuming @xmath97 .",
    "the dynamics above determines the bulk lorentz factor and the thermal lorentz factors of the accelerated electrons of each region as function of time .",
    "we consider synchrotron radiation from each region at different stages . according to the standard afterglow model ( mszros & rees 1997b ; sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) , the spectrum consists of four power - law segments separated by three break frequencies : the self - absorption frequency @xmath98 , the characteristic frequency @xmath99 , and the cooling frequency @xmath100 , with the peak flux @xmath101 . to calculate them",
    ", we assume that for region 3 the electron and magnetic field energy densities are fractions @xmath102 and @xmath103 of the total energy density behind the reverse shock ( where @xmath104 ) , but for region 2 , fractions @xmath105 and @xmath106 of the total energy density behind the forward shock ( where @xmath107 ) .",
    "one may expect that @xmath108 and/or @xmath109 , as suggested in some recent studies ( coburn & boggs 2003 ; zhang , kobayashi & mszros 2003 ; kumar & panaitescu 2003 ) .",
    "in addition , we assume that the spectral index of the electron energy distribution is @xmath110 for region 3 and @xmath111 for region 2 .    at stage",
    "i ( @xmath74 ) , the break frequencies and peak flux of region 3 are derived as @xmath112 where @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 is the luminosity distance to the source in units of @xmath117 cm .",
    "we here considered only the characteristic frequency and the cooling frequency for the optical to x - ray emission discussed in this paper . in our derivation , we used equations ( 8) , ( 10 ) and ( 17 ) to obtain the energy density of region 3 , @xmath118 , and the magnetic field strength , @xmath119 g. we define a cooling time @xmath120 through @xmath121 as @xmath122 from equations ( 22 ) and ( 23 ) , we find that region 3 is in the slow - cooling regime for @xmath123 but in the fast - cooling regime for @xmath124 , in contrast to the standard afterglow model ( sari et al . 1998 ) . a larger value of @xmath34 would imply fast cooling in region 3 earlier on , in which case region 2 could still stay at stage i. for region 2 , the break frequencies and peak flux are given by @xmath125 where @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 ( sari et al . 1998 ) .    at stage ii ( @xmath129 ) , since @xmath130 , we obtain the break frequencies and the peak flux for region 3 , @xmath131 and for region 2 , @xmath132 we define another cooling time @xmath133 at which @xmath134 as follows @xmath135 equation ( 29 ) is valid only for @xmath136 .",
    "otherwise , once region 3 enters the fast - cooling regime or the wind luminosity weakens obviously , its pressure becomes insignificant as compared to that of region 2 and thus evolution of the wind bubble comes back to @xmath91 .",
    "we assume @xmath137 . if @xmath138 , then region 3 is adiabatic and its emission spectrum is determined by equation ( 29 ) . if @xmath139 , region 3 becomes fast cooling , and the break frequencies and the peak flux for region 2 evolve as @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 . at stage iii ,",
    "the emission flux of region 3 : @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the spectral index at @xmath133 ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) .    on the other hand , @xmath145 is assumed . if @xmath129 , the spectrum and light curves for regions 3 and 2 are obtained by using equations ( 29 ) and ( 30 ) , respectively .",
    "but if @xmath96 ( stage iii ) , because of adiabatic expansion of region 3 , the break frequencies and the peak flux decay as @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 ( sari & piran 1999 ) .",
    "according to the derived scaling laws of the break frequencies and peak flux with time at three stages , we can obtain the light curve indices for different frequency bands in the case of @xmath149 ( see table 1 ) . as an example , figure 1 presents r - band light curves for typical values of the model parameters : @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 .",
    "we can see that the emission flux from region 2 decays rapidly at time @xmath160 , subsequently fades more slowly at time @xmath161 , and finally declines based on the initial evolution law ( dai & lu 1998 ) .",
    "more importantly , the emission from region 3 dominates the afterglow emission , which leads to a bump in the afterglow light curve .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ t : afterglow ]",
    "based on the successful models of the crab nebula , we discuss the dynamics of a relativistic wind bubble and its emission signatures . such a wind bubble",
    "is naturally expected when an ultrarelativistic e@xmath2e@xmath3-pair wind from a highly magnetized , rapidly rotating object at the center of an afterglow interacts with an outward - expanding fireball , regardless of whether this object is a millisecond magnetar or a kerr black hole .",
    "we find that when the injection energy significantly exceeds the initial energy of the fireball , the bulk lorentz factor of the wind bubble declines more slowly than before .",
    "in addition , the reverse - shock emission could dominate the afterglow emission , which leads to a bump in afterglow light curves . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the case of @xmath97 .",
    "however , even if @xmath162 , a bump in figure 1 still appears for some parameter space as we move the late - time light curve of region 3 to early times .",
    "bump features have been detected in some events ( e.g. , grbs 970508 , 000301c , 021004 , and 030329 ) . to interpret these features , some other models invoked the microlensing event ( garnavich , loeb & stanek 2000 ) , density - jump medium ( dai & lu 2002 ; lazzati et al . 2002 ; dai & wu 2003 ) , pure poynting - flux injection ( dai & lu 1998 ; zhang & mszros 2001 ) , baryon - dominated injection ( rees & mszros 1998 ; sari & mszros 2000 ; zhang & mszros 2002 ; granot , nakar & piran 2003 ) , and two - component jet ( berger et al . 2003 ; huang et al . 2003 ) . the magnetic field in the reversely - shocked region of the wind bubble seems to consist of two components : a toroidal field and a random field .",
    "the latter may be naturally generated by the relativistic two - stream instability ( medvedev & loeb 1999 ) .",
    "if the toroidal field dominates over the random component , one would expect high polarization of the bump emission , which could be used to distinguish between our wind - bubble model and other explanations .",
    "it is well known that the degree of linear polarization of synchrotron radiation from the reversely - shocked wind is about @xmath163 for a large - scale toroidal magnetic field .",
    "thus , the polarization of an afterglow in our model could be as high as @xmath164 for @xmath165 when the reverse shock emission dominates the afterglow emission _ during an obvious bump_.",
    "even if the total afterglow flux is dominated by the forward shock emission , and the reversely - shocked wind provides only a small fraction of the total flux , @xmath166 , then the shocked pair wind could still dominate the polarized flux with linear polarization of @xmath167 .",
    "this value is larger than the currently observed data of grbs 021004 and 030329 ( @xmath168 , rol et al .",
    "2003 ; lazzati et al . 2003",
    "; greiner et al . 2003 ) .",
    "if , on the other hand , the random - field strength exceeds the toroidal component , the calculated degree of linear polarization is significantly less than that estimated above .",
    "we have considered a spherical wind bubble in our paper . however , there is evidence that grbs are collimated into narrow jets , whose kinetic energy is clustered at @xmath169 ergs ( frail et al .",
    "2001 ; panaitescu & kumar 2002 ; berger , kulkarni & frail 2003 ; bloom , frail & kulkarni 2003 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "relativistic winds from millisecond magnetars are roughly isotropic and their total energy is @xmath170 ergs .",
    "beaming correction gives an injection energy of @xmath171 ergs within the initial solid angle of a jet .",
    "this energy is of the same order as @xmath172 .",
    "actually , the jet can get more energy from its central magnetar due to sideways expansion .",
    "this would favor our model .",

    "<S> highly magnetized , rapidly rotating compact objects are widely argued as central energy sources of @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) . </S>",
    "<S> after the grb , such a magnetar - like object may directly lose its rotational energy through some magnetically - driven processes , which produce an ultrarelativistic wind dominated possibly by the energy flux of electron - positron pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction of such a wind with an outward - expanding fireball leads to a relativistic wind bubble , being regarded as a relativistic version of the well - studied crab nebula . </S>",
    "<S> we here explore the dynamics of this wind bubble and its emission signatures . </S>",
    "<S> we find that when the injection energy significantly exceeds the initial energy of the fireball , the bulk lorentz factor of the wind bubble decays more slowly than before , and more importantly , the reverse - shock emission could dominate the afterglow emission , which yields a bump in afterglow light curves . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , high polarization of the bump emission would be expected if a toroidal magnetic field in the shocked wind dominates over the random component . </S>"
