    "much of the preoccupation of classical information theory is in making the correlation between two ends of a communication channel  that is , between a sender and a receiver  as high as possible .",
    "this is what ( classical ) communication is about .",
    "in contrast , this is only part of the story for the fledgling field of _ quantum _ information theory .",
    "the quantum world brings with it a new resource that senders and receivers can share : quantum entanglement , the stuff einstein - podolsky - rosen pairs and bell - inequality violations are made of .",
    "this new resource , of all the things in quantum information theory , is the most truly `` quantum '' of the lot .",
    "it is a resource because of the myriad ways in which it is starting to be used .",
    "the list of its applications already includes quantum key distribution @xcite , quantum - state teleportation @xcite , entanglement - enhanced classical communication @xcite , error - correction for quantum computers @xcite , entanglement - assisted multi - party communication @xcite , and better control of atomic frequency standards @xcite among other things .",
    "the list grows every day .",
    "the newfound importance of `` entanglement as a resource '' behooves us to quantify entanglement in as many distinct ways as possible . to this end",
    ", we explore a new quantification of the entanglement of a general ( mixed ) quantum state for a bipartite system .",
    "this quantity we dub the _ entanglement of assistance_. it is something of a dual notion to that of the _ entanglement of formation _ studied by bennett , divincenzo , smolin and wootters @xcite",
    ". it can be motivated in the following way .",
    "consider three players alice , bob , and charlie , who jointly possess many copies of a tripartite quantum system each described by the pure state @xmath0 .",
    "it follows that alice and bob , considered in isolation , possess many copies of the ( generally mixed ) state @xmath1 .",
    "suppose now that alice and bob need to use their shared quantum system for one of the tasks above , teleportation for instance",
    ". however , very unfortunately , charlie is not immediately available to pass his systems over for their use . since their state",
    "may not be very pure or entangled for that matter , they may be seriously impaired by this .",
    "how might charlie help in spite of his constraint ?",
    "one thing he can do is perform a measurement on each system that he possesses so that alice and bob will have pure states conditioned on his outcomes . if he transmits the classical information so obtained , they may be able to use it to their benefit .",
    "for instance , if several of his measurements reveal that alice and bob actually possess the pure state @xmath2 , then by the result of bennett , et al .",
    "@xcite , they can convert these quantum states into maximally - entangled singlet states at a rate of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 . in general then ,",
    "for a measurement that creates the states @xmath5 with probabilities @xmath6 , i.e. , an ensemble @xmath7 , the average rate for conversion to singlets will be @xmath8    since charlie is a friend of alice and bob , he should choose his measurement so that this average rate is maximized . by a theorem of hughston , jozsa , and wootters @xcite this maximization",
    "can be taken over all possible ensembles @xmath9 consistent with @xmath10 in the sense that @xmath11    therefore the resulting maximal rate is a number intrinsic to @xmath10 , depending upon no further details of the state @xmath0 .",
    "this is the _ entanglement of assistance _",
    "@xmath12 for @xmath10 : @xmath13 this quantity seems to be dual to the entanglement of formation , which is defined by @xmath14    in this paper , we demonstrate several properties possessed by entanglement of assistance , calculating it explicitly for some specialized cases .",
    "we exhibit a general upper bound , a particular upper bound specialized to the two - qubit case and a lower bound for diagonal density matrices , on the entanglement of asistance . with the aid of the last two",
    ", we prove a fairly surprising property : the entanglement of assistance is in some cases superadditive .",
    "that is , there exist density operators @xmath15 for which @xmath16 this means that if charlie performs entangled measurements on his separate copies of the system , he can be more effective in helping alice and bob than he would have been otherwise .",
    "the average entanglement of an ensemble is invariant under local unitary transformations and non - increasing under general local operations with classical communication @xcite ; so entanglement of assistance also has these properties .",
    "in addition to this it is easy to see that since there is a maximization over all possible pure - state realizations of the density matrix , the entanglement of assistance @xmath17 is concave .",
    "that is , @xmath18    we note here that the entanglement of assistance is the least of all concave functions coinciding on pure states with their partial entropy i.e. entropy as seen from one side , while entanglement of fomation is the greatest convex function with that property .",
    "this may be seen as a sign of the mentioned duality between the two .",
    "since we do not have a general formula for entanglement of assistance of a given density matrix , upper and lower bounds are of great importance .",
    "we have found a few bounds which have helped us calculate the entanglement of assistance in some cases and have been of immense value in proving its superadditivity .",
    "we have found an upper bound  the entropic bound  which works in general , and another upper bound  the fidelity bound  which works for the simplest case of one qubit on alice s side and one on bob s side .",
    "the entanglement of assistance is never greater than the minimum of the partial entropy as seen by alice or bob : @xmath19\\enspace .",
    "\\label{eq : bound : entropic}\\ ] ] to prove this assume that @xmath20 is achieved by the pure - state ensemble @xmath21 , then by the concavity of von neumann entropy @xmath22 we have , @xmath23 the same inequality holds with trace over a replaced by trace over b. combining them we get the entropic bound .    since the von neumann entropy is additive and concave the bound is also additive and concave .",
    "thus for states which saturate this bound the entanglement of assistance must be additive .",
    "we can also see from the results of section ( [ sec : examples ] ) that the entropic bound is zero if and only if the entanglement of assistance is zero .",
    "the bound obviously agrees with entanglement of assistance for pure states .",
    "it is easy to show that for the case of one qubit each on alice s and bob s side , the entropic bound is maximum ( 1 ebit ) if and only if the entanglement of assistance is also maximum .      for the case of one qubit",
    "each with alice and bob , we can get a bound that is sometimes stronger than the entropic bound .",
    "it says that the entanglement of assistance can not be greater than the fidelity of the density matrix relative to its complex conjugate in the magic basis ; @xmath24 ; @xmath25 ; @xmath26 .",
    "] i.e. , @xmath27 where the @xmath28  hill - wootters tilde  represents complex conjugation in the magic basis @xcite and @xmath29 tr@xmath30 is the fidelity @xcite that is , the square root of the transition probability @xcite . to prove the bound",
    "the main thing we need is a classical inequality on the binary shannon entropy @xcite .",
    "it is , @xmath31 equality is achieved in this if and only if @xmath32 . the other facts we need are that for a pure state @xmath33 in a decomposition of @xmath34 , the largest eigenvalue , @xmath35 , of its reduced density operator is given in terms of the hill - wootters tilde by @xmath36\\ ] ] and , that the fidelity function is doubly concave in its two arguments and @xmath37    putting all this together : for any ensemble @xmath38 consistent with @xmath34 average entanglement is @xmath39 the bound in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bound : fidelity ] ) follows immediately .",
    "note the conditions for saturating this bound .",
    "in particular , in going from eq .",
    "( [ fizzle ] ) to ( [ snubbton ] ) , we see that this new bound can be achieved only if @xmath34 has a decomposition consisting only of maximally entangled and completely unentangled states .",
    "thus the bound ca nt be tight generally  consider simply a @xmath34 that is pure but not itself maximally entangled .",
    "however , we will see in section ( [ sec : superadditivity ] ) that this bound is sometimes better than the entropic bound .      to get lower bounds we use the fact that the average entanglement of any pure - state realization of the density matrix gives us a lower bound on the entanglement of assistance .",
    "using this idea we can come up with lower bounds by making systematic pure - state decompositions of the density matrix .",
    "for example , average entanglement of the eigenvector decomposition of the density matrix is a lower bound .    applying the above idea to density matrices diagonal in a product basis we get a lower bound which we name _ diagonal lower bound_.",
    "consider the case of only one qubit on either side so that the product basis can be written as @xmath40 .",
    "the density matrix in this product basis looks like , @xmath41 and the bound is , @xmath42 this follows from the pure state realization of @xmath34 : @xmath43 , with @xmath44 numerical results using optimization algorithms suggest that this is indeed the exact formula for entanglement of assistance for these density matrices .",
    "also when this result saturates any of the upper bounds we know that it is the answer .",
    "the bound can easily be generalized to higher dimensions .",
    "another thing to note here is that off - diagonal terms between @xmath45 and @xmath46 do nt change the lower bound because we can still use a similar pure state decomposition as before , with slightly modified probabilities .",
    "let us start by characterizing the states that have zero entanglement of assistance .",
    "we find that there is a very simple characterization of these states as , states whose density matrix is pure on at least one side .",
    "that is , either @xmath47 .    to prove this result first note",
    "that since the entropic ( upper ) bound ( [ eq : bound : entropic ] ) is zero for such states , these states have zero entanglement of assistance . let us now prove that only such states can have zero entanglement of assistance .",
    "since entanglement of assistance is zero , every valid pure - state decomposition of @xmath34 must consist exclusively of product states .",
    "( for otherwise the average entanglement of that ensemble will be necessarily greater then zero . ) so let us focus on an eigendecomposition of @xmath34 : this is an ensemble @xmath48    because the ensemble @xmath9 is an eigenensemble , we must have either @xmath49 or @xmath50 or both . first note that it can not be the case that both inner products vanish . for otherwise , there will be at least one value of @xmath51 for which @xmath52 and @xmath53 will be entangled states .",
    "consequently , let us look at one of the other possibilities : namely , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are othogonal , but @xmath56 .",
    "then we must have @xmath57 .",
    "for otherwise , again  for at least one value of @xmath51both @xmath52 and @xmath53 will be entangled states .",
    "the argument goes analogously if @xmath58 and @xmath59 are othogonal .",
    "that is to say , @xmath52 and @xmath53 must indeed be product states but with either identical left factors or identical right factors .",
    "therefore , just to say it again ( but now ignoring phases , since they could have been in the `` unitary reshuffling '' anyway ) , we must have either @xmath60 or @xmath61 .",
    "locking one of these possiblities in , we can go through exactly the same argument for similar `` unitary reshufflings '' of other pairs of eigenstates .",
    "consistency then gives that we must find either @xmath62  ebits .",
    "here , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the dimensions of the hilbert spaces on alice s and bob s side respectively . ] for entanglement of assistance .",
    "this is the set of all possible mixtures of maximally entangled pure - states . for the simplest non - trivial case of one qubit on either side , this is equivalent to the set of ` t ' states of horodecki et al .",
    "@xcite or equivalently the set of real density matrices in the magic basis @xcite .",
    "next we consider some non - extremal examples .",
    "consider states like @xmath65 diagonal[@xmath66 in a product basis .",
    "the entropic bound ( [ eq : bound : entropic ] ) says @xmath67 and the diagonal lower bound ( [ eq : bound : diagonal ] ) gives us @xmath68 so that @xmath69 .",
    "let us look at a more complicated example , say @xmath65 diagonal[1/3,1/3,1/3,0 ] in a product basis .",
    "the diagonal bound ( [ eq : bound : diagonal ] ) gives us @xmath70 .",
    "for the fidelity bound , we first calculate @xmath71diagonal[0,1/3,1/3,1/3 ] and by the fidelity bound ( [ eq : bound : fidelity ] ) we see that @xmath72 . thus @xmath73 .",
    "notice that the entropic bound for this case is just @xmath74  ebits .",
    "since it does not saturate the entropic bound this state is a good candidate for superadditivity .",
    "let us turn to that next .",
    "it has been speculated ( and is indicated numerically for a few cases ) that the entanglement of formation is additive @xcite .",
    "this property is very important if it is to be used as a measure of entanglement .",
    "since entanglement of assistance looks dual to entanglement of formation it comes as a bit of a surprise then that the entanglement of formation is superadditive . by this we mean @xmath75 for some density matrices @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "since the entropic bound is additive , superadditivity is possible only for the states which do not saturate the bound .",
    "the density matrix @xmath65diagonal[1/3,1/3,1/3,0 ] which we have just seen in section ( [ sec : examples ] ) has an entanglement of assistance @xmath78 .",
    "recall that this state does not saturate the ( additive ) entropic bound .",
    "so it can show superadditivity and in fact it does !",
    "if @xmath17 were additive : @xmath79",
    ". however @xmath80 can be realized as an ensemble @xmath81 which has an average entanglement @xmath82 .",
    "( this ensemble is shown in detail in appendix [ ap : superadd ] ) .",
    "this being a lower bound on @xmath83 it shows that entanglement of assistance is superadditive .",
    "superadditivity of entanglement of assistance means that if alice , bob , and charlie have two copies of the same system then charlie can give alice and bob more entanglement if he makes an entangled measurement on the two copies of the system .    since entanglement of assistance and entanglement of formation are dual to each other in the sense of replacing a maximization by a minimization",
    ", we would expect the superadditivity of the entanglement of assistance to tell us something about the additivity of the entanglement of formation .",
    "we have not been able to see a connection as yet but we note here a result @xcite , @xmath84 which connects entanglement of assistance and entanglement of formation .",
    "thus in addition to its own physical significance , entanglement of assistance may turn out to be a useful tool to study the problem of additivity of the entanglement of formation .      here",
    "we look at the ensemble which gives us an average entanglement more than the additive value of 4/3 for the density matrix discussed is section ( [ sec : superadditivity ] ) .",
    "the ensemble written in the product basis @xmath85 is , @xmath86 where , @xmath87 and , @xmath88      to find this ensemble we use the following procedure : first , we use a numerical optimization program to find the ensemble which has the maximum average entanglement .",
    "then using the structure of this ensemble , guessing the right phases and using the constraint that the ensemble must give us @xmath93 we get a quadratic equation which we solve to find the values for @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "note that according to our numerical results , the ensemble presented here achieves the maximum average entanglement consistent with the density matrix .",
    "this suggests that this is the entanglement of assistance for it .",
