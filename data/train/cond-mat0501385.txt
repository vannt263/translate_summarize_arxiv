    "conductance peaks and coulomb blockade ( cb ) valleys mark the charge transport across a small quantum dot ( qd ) , weakly coupled to the contacts , when the gate voltage @xmath1 is varied .",
    "however , in a large qd the multilevel structure can not be ignored .",
    "the dot may display a `` core '' level structure including levels @xmath2 which are localized at different places of the dot area .",
    "hence , they may not hybridize among themselves , nor directly with the contact leads , but they may be weakly coupled to one or more conduction channels .",
    "the latter could be of `` edge '' type and extend from the left ( l ) to the right ( r ) contact .",
    "the existence of such an edge and core level structure in large qds has been proven experimentally by single electron capacitance spectroscopy @xcite . in linear transport measurements ,",
    "the coupling of localized and delocalized states , called `` bouncing states '' in @xcite , has been invoked to justify the asymmetry of the cb peaks .    on the other hand ,",
    "fano resonances are ubiquitous in the conductance of nanodevices .",
    "they arise when localized levels are embedded in a continuum of single particle extended states which contribute to transport @xcite .",
    "linear conductance on a semi - open qd displays many transmission peaks with the characteristic fano shape , each time a core level crosses the chemical potential @xmath3 @xcite .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we have shown that a fano - like pattern also appears when the continuum of conduction states at @xmath3 originates from electron correlations , as is the case of a broad kondo resonance @xcite , due to a strongly hybridized level @xmath4 , lying deeply below @xmath3 .",
    "a bunch of localized core levels @xmath2 , weakly coupled to the @xmath4 level , imprints the broad kondo peak with fano lineshapes .",
    "the kondo conductance tends to freeze the charge sitting on the @xmath4 level , in competition with the fano mechanism which causes particle number oscillations .",
    "kondo correlations stick the charge occupancy of the @xmath4 level to the value one , and the fano factor @xmath0 close to zero .",
    "it follows that the transmission shows a dip in form of an antiresonance .    in opening the qd",
    "further , by increasing the coupling to the contacts , @xmath5 ( r= l , r ) , the cb structure is eventually washed out .",
    "we assume that a single edge channel of energy @xmath4 is centered at @xmath6 , providing a broad single particle resonance peak in the transmission . the electron flow across the dot is essentially uncorrelated .",
    "nevertheless , the dynamics of the charge in the core levels does influence the resonant tunnelling , as we show in section ii of the present work .",
    "the @xmath2 levels hybridize with the contacts only indirectly , by weakly coupling to the @xmath4 resonance , with a hopping matrix element @xmath7 .",
    "we also include some on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath8 at the core sites , which produces a lower hubbard level @xmath2 ( with single occupancy ) and an upper hubbard level ( with double occupancy ) @xmath9 .    by including the charge piled up in the @xmath2 states within the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation",
    ", we find that the main features of the fano landscape are not lost .",
    "there are two main alterations , however : @xmath10 the charge screens the gate voltage @xmath1 by acting on the @xmath4 level with a capacitive interaction and it shifts the resonances ; @xmath11 the presence of the charge modifies the fano @xmath0 factor and induces a marked asymmetry in the peaks .",
    "in section iii we elaborate on modeling the experimental setup that has been investigated recently by johnson _",
    "the conductance measured through a quantum point contact ( qpc ) `` senses '' the addition of charge to a qd , which is capacitively coupled , parallel to the qpc .",
    "we show that our model applies with small modifications . in this case",
    "the edge channel is not internal to the dot but it describes the qpc conductance , while the @xmath2 levels localized within the dot are fed with charge by an external reservoir",
    ". we neglect @xmath8 which implies only minor modification when the static screening approximation holds , but we include a small hybridization @xmath12 of the core states to the current carrying qpc state .",
    "this allows us to monitor the full range from bare capacitive coupling or ",
    "charge sensing  ( cs ) , to fano resonant tunneling .",
    "an increasing gate voltage applied to the dot shifts the discrete structure of energy levels across @xmath6 and the core levels are gradually filled by electrons .",
    "the charge accumulated in the core levels capacitatively modifies the gate voltage acting on the conducting channel . in the  charge sensing  case ,",
    "sudden jumps appear in the conductance , monitoring the discreteness of the charge accumulation process . additionally , when @xmath13 0 , a set of fano resonances emerges in the conductance across the dot as a result of quantum interference .",
    "we show that the shape of fano resonances is markedly affected by the charge trapping within the core levels as found in the experiment@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system under consideration is composed of parts describing the edge state of the dot , @xmath14 , the core qd levels , @xmath15 and the electrodes @xmath16 :    @xmath17    the edge qd state of energy @xmath18 is hybridized with electrodes .",
    "the matrix element @xmath19 , ( @xmath20l , r ) has a given dependence on the gate voltage @xmath21 , very much like what happens in a qpc , which opens up when the gate voltage increases @xcite .",
    "the capacitive coupling is described by a cross - interaction @xmath22 between the edge and the core states ( @xmath23 is the occupation number on the core state @xmath24 ) .",
    "the retarded green function for the edge state is obtained by the equation of motion method ( eom ) with an additional hf decoupling of the capacitive interaction :    @xmath25    the first term on the r.h.s . is an average on the ground state of the system @xmath26 ( zero temperature is assumed ) .",
    "it includes hybridization with the contact leads .",
    "the occupancy of the core levels is selfconsistently determined from @xmath27 , where the green function of a @xmath28-level with spin @xmath29 is given in the hubbard approximation @xcite : @xmath30 ^{-1}.\\ ] ] thus , @xmath31 has finite width @xmath32 due to indirect interaction with electrodes .",
    "the bare @xmath33 is also additionally shifted @xmath34 by the real part of the r.h.s . in eq .",
    "[ ggamma ] .",
    "charge accumulation in the core states themselves shifts the position of these levels with respect to the chemical potential even further , but we neglect this capacitative modification of their energy location in the calculation , since it is inessential , as core levels do not participate directly in the transport across the dot .    the linear conductance ( i.e. in zero limit of the drain - source voltage ) in units of the quantum conductance @xmath35 , is @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the fermi distribution function , @xmath38 $ ] is the hybridization of the edge state with the contact leads ( @xmath39= @xmath40 is further assumed ) and the spectral density @xmath41 .",
    "it is instructive to introduce fano parameter @xmath0 defined as @xcite : @xmath42 with gate voltage screened by the trapped charge : @xmath43    let us consider one single core level for the time being .",
    "the @xmath21 , @xmath44 are the bare and screened voltage acting on the edge level , but they move the core level as well . in crossing @xmath3 , the core level is gradually filled with electrons . the occupancy of the @xmath28 level is shown in the inset of fig.([gate ] ) for various @xmath12 s . in turn , while the occupancy of the core level changes , a step appears in the screened voltage , resulting from the capacitive coupling between the core and the edge state .",
    "@xmath45 is plotted in fig .",
    "( [ gate ] ) _ vs _ the bare @xmath21 .",
    "two such kinks appear , corresponding to the single and double occupancy of the @xmath28 level .",
    "their energy separation is of the order of the coulomb repulsion @xmath46 ( taken as @xmath47 in the calculation ) .",
    "the dependence of the hybridization parameter on the voltage is implemented by multiplying the matrix element @xmath48 by the function @xmath49 + 1\\rbrace^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath50 (= 0.5 ) controls the sharpness of the kink , and @xmath51 (= -0.2 in calculations ) its position .",
    "the kink is smoothed with increasing of the hybridization @xmath12 between @xmath18 and @xmath52 because the electron has an increasing preference to tunnel resonantly through @xmath18 instead of dwelling on the @xmath52 level@xcite when @xmath18 crosses the chemical potential . here",
    "@xmath53 is the charge sensitivity parameter .",
    "it can increase to unity when the level broadening in qd becomes larger than the level spacing and the cross - interaction @xmath22 approaches on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath8 .    in fig .",
    "( [ fanohub ] ) we plot the corresponding conductance , for various @xmath54 .",
    "the filling of the @xmath52 level has a marked effect on the shape of the fano resonances because it modifies the fano @xmath0 factor ( see inset ) .",
    "the non zero value of @xmath0 and its sign are responsible for the asymmetry of the fano dips within the broad conductance peak centered at @xmath55 .",
    "[ ht ] = 0.4    [ ht ] = 0.4",
    "our model can also be applied straightforwardly to describe recent transport measurements through a qpc  sensing \" the charge piled up in a qd placed at its side and capacitively coupled to it @xcite .",
    "we show that it is possible to continuously move from a `` capacitive sensing '' to a `` fano sensing '' by increasing the hybridization of the single particle levels @xmath2 of the dot with the conduction channel @xmath4 of the qpc .",
    "@xmath56 $ ] and @xmath57 .",
    "we have added an additional reservoir @xmath58 , in contact with the dot , with levels @xmath59 corresponding to single particle operators @xmath60 . a featureless and broad density of states for the reservoir is assumed .",
    "the dot is supplied with electrons from the bath @xmath58 due to the hopping parameter @xmath61 .",
    "the level @xmath18 corresponds now to the qpc , having a gate voltage dependent hybridization with the leads . in figs .",
    "( [ qpccharge ] , [ qpcfano ] ) we report the results for a multilevel dot with @xmath28= 13 discrete levels equally spaced by @xmath62 and symmetrically located with respect to @xmath63 for @xmath64 . in this hypothesis",
    "we can assume that @xmath65 is the addition energy of the dot , independent of the electron number @xmath66 .",
    "thus , we drop the interaction term @xmath67 in @xmath15 and the relevant energy scale for charge sensing is now @xmath65 itself . a static screening in the multi - electron system",
    "is expected to be quite effective , if the dot is large .",
    "the screened gate voltage acting on the qpc , sensing the charge on the dot , takes now the same form as eq .",
    "( [ gateint ] ) , but with @xmath22 replaced by the charging energy of the dot @xmath68 .",
    "the @xmath54 parameter now describes the sensitivity of the capacitive coupling between the qd and qpc which can be controlled by appropriate gates @xcite .",
    "again , the particle number on the dot @xmath69 is determined by means of the friedel sum rule @xcite .",
    "it shows the usual steps as in the inset of fig .",
    "( [ gate ] ) when the gate voltage increases and the dot is filled by electrons . for @xmath54=1 the cs is equal to the charging energy , each time an electron hops onto the dot .      fig .",
    "( [ qpccharge ] ) shows the conductance through the qpc when the dot is only capacitively coupled to it ( @xmath70=0 ) , for various @xmath54 s . for @xmath54=0",
    "the dot has no effect on the qpc conductance .",
    "the transmission across the qpc displays a broad resonance centered at @xmath71 .",
    "its width and characteristic asymmetry is governed by the gate voltage dependent coupling to the @xmath72 contacts . by increasing @xmath54 ,",
    "the maximum of the resonance is moved to higher @xmath21 s , because of the voltage screening .",
    "the conductance peak acquires a sawtooth pattern , which grows sharper when @xmath54 increases .",
    "the pattern follows the jumps of @xmath73 , each time a new electron enters the dot .",
    "the shape of the overall conductance curve is similar to the one seen in the experiment ( see fig .",
    "( 2a ) of @xcite ) .    in fig.([qpcfano ] ) , the conductance is reported for finite hopping between qd and qpc ( @xmath70=0.15 @xmath68 ) , at @xmath740.0 , 0.5 , 1.0 .",
    "the case @xmath75 is the pure fano case .",
    "the maximum of the conductance is still centered at @xmath76 because @xmath77 has been chosen to be rather small .",
    "the zero of the real part of the qpc green s function @xmath78 defines the location of the maximum of the resonance , and the zero of the fano @xmath0 as well , according to eq.([fanoq ] ) .",
    "the symmetric fano dip corresponding to @xmath79 is centered on top of the conductance maximum , because a @xmath80 level sits exactly at @xmath64 .",
    "when @xmath81 increases , the condition @xmath82 now marks the location of the conductance maximum , as well as the place where @xmath83 ( see the inset of fig.([qpcfano ] ) ) .",
    "thus , the conductance envelope moves again to larger voltages , together with the fano - like structures , and the conductance peak broadens as in fig .",
    "( [ qpccharge ] ) .",
    "appearance of sharp peaks for large negative gate voltages is caused by rapid decrease of @xmath0 ( see inset ) due to the closing of qpc , eq .",
    "( [ fanoq ] ) .",
    "our case with @xmath84 compares well with fig.(2b ) of @xcite , displaying coulomb modified fano resonances .",
    "@xcite and in ref.@xcite propose a model conductance based on the grand canonical average of dot configurations , which can be fitted to the experimental data .",
    "our calculation shows that the dynamics of the resonant tunnelling together with some minor assumptions provide simpler results , in qualitative agreement with the experimental data .    to conclude",
    ", we have demonstrated that a coulomb modified fano resonant tunneling arises from charge sensing in structures like a qpc with a dot aside , or inside a large dot where core levels coexist with extended edge states and both can be described within the same quantum mechanical model with minor modifications .",
