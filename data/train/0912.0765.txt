    "wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) have been recognized as a new generation of ubiquitous computing systems to support a broad range of applications , including monitoring , health care and tracking environmental pollution levels .",
    "minimizing the total energy consumption in both circuit components and rf signal transmission is a crucial challenge in designing a wsn .",
    "central to this study is to find energy - efficient modulation and coding schemes in the physical layer of a wsn to prolong the sensor lifetime @xcite . for this purpose , energy - efficient modulation /",
    "coding schemes should be simple enough to be implemented by state - of - the - art low - power technology , but still robust enough to provide the desired service .",
    "furthermore , since sensor nodes frequently switch from sleep mode to active mode , modulation and coding circuits should have fast start - up times @xcite along with the capability of transmitting packets during a pre - assigned time slot before new sensed packets arrive .",
    "in addition , a wsn needs a powerful channel coding scheme which protects transmitted data against the unpredictable and harsh nature of channels .",
    "finally , since coding increases the required transmitted bandwidth , when considered independently of modulation , the best tradeoff between energy - efficient modulation and coding for a given transmission bandwidth should be considered as well .",
    "we refer to these low - complexity and low - energy consumption approaches in wsns providing proper link reliability without increasing a given transmission bandwidth as _ green modulation / coding _ ( gmc ) schemes .",
    "there have been several recent works on the energy efficiency of various modulation and channel coding schemes in wsns ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite analyze the power efficiency of pulse position modulation ( ppm ) and frequency shift keying ( fsk ) in a wsn without considering the effect of channel coding . under the assumption of the non - linear battery model",
    ", reference @xcite shows that fsk is more power - efficient than ppm in sparse wsns , while ppm may outperform fsk in dense wsns .",
    "reference @xcite investigates the energy efficiency of bch and convolutional codes with non - coherent fsk for the optimal packet length in a point - to - point wsn .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that bch codes can improve energy efficiency compared to the convolutional code for optimal fixed packet size .",
    "reference @xcite analyzes the effect of different linear block channel codes with fsk modulation on energy consumptions of a low - power wireless embedded network when the number of hops increases .",
    "@xcite investigate the energy efficiency of uncoded nc - mfsk modulation scheme in a multiple - access wsn over rayleigh fading channels , where multiple senders transmit their data to a central node in a frequency - division multiple access ( fdma ) fashion .",
    "reference @xcite presents the hardware implementation of the forward error correction ( fec ) encoder in ieee 802.15.4 wsns , which employs parallel just - in - time processing to achieve a low processing latency and energy consumption .",
    "most of the pioneering works on energy - efficient modulation / coding , including research in @xcite , has focused only on minimizing the energy consumption of transmitting one bit , ignoring the effect of bandwidth and transmission time duration . in a practical wsn however , it is shown that minimizing the total energy consumption depends strongly on the active mode duration and the channel bandwidth .",
    "references @xcite and @xcite address this issue in a point - to - point wsn , where a sensor node transmits an equal amount of data per time unit to a designated sink node . in @xcite , the authors consider the optimal energy consumption per information bit as a function of modulation and coding parameters in a wsn over additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channels with path - loss .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that uncoded mqam is more energy - efficient than uncoded mfsk for short - range applications . for higher distance , however , using convolutional coded mfsk over awgn is desirable .",
    "this line of work is further extended in @xcite by evaluating the energy consumption per information bit of a wsn for reed solomon ( rs ) codes and various modulation schemes over awgn channels with path - loss .",
    "also , the impact of different transmission distances on the energy consumption per information bit is investigated in @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", the authors do not consider the effect of multi - path fading .",
    "reference @xcite addresses this problem in a similar wsn model as @xcite and @xcite , and shows that among various sinusoidal carrier - based modulation schemes , non - coherent m - ary frequency shift keying ( nc - mfsk ) with small order of constellation size @xmath3 can be considered the most energy - efficient modulation in proactive wsns over rayleigh and rician fading channels .",
    "however , no channel coding scheme was considered in @xcite .",
    "more recently , the attention of researchers has been drawn to deploying rateless codes ( e.g. , luby transform ( lt ) code @xcite ) in wsns due to the outstanding advantages of these codes in _",
    "erasure channels_. for instance in @xcite , the authors present a scheme for cooperative error control coding using rateless and low - density generator - matrix ( ldgm ) codes in a multiple relay wsn .",
    "however , investigating the energy efficiency of rateless codes in wsns with green modulations over realistic fading channel models has received little attention . to the best of our knowledge , there is no existing analysis on the energy efficiency of rateless coded modulation that considers the effect of channel bandwidth and active mode duration on the total energy consumption in a practical proactive wsn .",
    "this paper addresses this problem and presents the first in - depth analysis of the energy efficiency of lt codes with nc - mfsk ( known as green modulation ) as described in @xcite .",
    "the present analysis is based on a realistic model in proactive wsns operating in a rayleigh flat - fading channel with path - loss .",
    "in addition , we obtain numerically the probability mass function of the lt code rate and the corresponding coding gain , and study their effects on the energy efficiency of the wsn .",
    "this study uses the classical bch and convolutional codes ( as reference codes ) , utilized in ieee standards , for comparative evaluation .",
    "experimental results show that the optimized lt coded nc - mfsk is the most energy - efficient scheme for distance @xmath0 greater than the threshold level @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , although uncoded nc - mfsk outperforms coded schemes for @xmath4 , the energy gap between lt coded and uncoded nc - mfsk is negligible for @xmath2 compared to the other coded schemes .",
    "this result comes from the simplicity and flexibility of the lt codes , and suggests that lt codes are beneficial in practical low - power wsns with dynamic position sensor nodes .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ system_model ] , the proactive system model over a realistic wireless channel model",
    "is described .",
    "the energy consumption of uncoded nc - mfsk modulation scheme is analyzed in section [ uncoded_mfsk ] .",
    "design of lt codes and the energy efficiency of the lt coded nc - mfsk are presented in section [ analysis_ch4 ] .",
    "in addition , the energy efficiency of some classical channel codes are studied in this section .",
    "section [ simulation_ch5 ] provides some numerical evaluations using realistic models to confirm our analysis .",
    "also , some design guidelines for using lt codes in practical wsn applications are presented .",
    "finally in section [ conclusion_ch6 ] , an overview of the results and conclusions are presented .    for convenience ,",
    "we provide a list of key mathematical symbols used in this paper in table i.    [ table234 ]    .list of notations [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     fig .",
    "[ fig : coded_uncoded ] shows the total energy consumption versus distance @xmath0 for the optimized bch , convolutional and lt coded nc - mfsk schemes , compared to the optimized uncoded nc - mfsk for @xmath5 .",
    "the optimization is done over @xmath3 and the parameters of coding scheme .",
    "simulation results show that for @xmath0 less than the threshold level @xmath6 m , the total energy consumption of optimized uncoded nc - mfsk is less than that of the coded nc - mfsk schemes .",
    "however , the energy gap between lt coded and uncoded nc - mfsk is negligible compared to the other coded schemes as expected . for @xmath7 , the lt coded nc - mfsk scheme is more energy - efficient than uncoded and other coded nc - mfsk schemes .",
    "also , it is observed that the energy gap between lt and convolutional coded nc - mfsk increases when the distance @xmath0 grows .",
    "this result comes from the high coding gain capability of lt codes which confirms our analysis in section [ analysis_ch4 ] .",
    "the threshold level @xmath1 ( for lt code ) or @xmath8 ( for bch and convolutional codes ) are obtained when the total energy consumptions of coded and uncoded systems become equal .",
    "for instance , using @xmath9 , and the equality between ( [ energy_totfsk ] ) and ( [ energy_totalcoded ] ) for uncoded and convolutional coded nc - mfsk , we have @xmath10}\\dfrac{1}{\\mathcal{l}_1 m_l}\\dfrac{\\upsilon_{c}^{cc}(1-r_c^{cc})}{\\upsilon_{c}^{cc}r_c^{cc}-1}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{\\eta}}.\\ ] ]    it should be noted that the above threshold level imposes a constraint on the design of the physical layer of some wireless sensor networking applications , in particular dynamic wsns . to obtain more insight into this issue , let assume that the location of the sensor node is changed every @xmath11 time unit , where @xmath12 is the channel coherence time . for the moment , let us assume that the sensor node aims to choose either a _ fixed - rate coded _ or an uncoded nc - mfsk based on the distance between sensor and sink nodes .",
    "according to the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : coded_uncoded ] , it is revealed that using fixed - rate channel coding is not energy efficient for short distance transmission ( i.e. , @xmath13 ) , while for @xmath14 , convolutional coded nc - mfsk is more energy - efficient than other schemes .",
    "for this configuration , the sensor node must have the capability of an adaptive coding scheme for each distance @xmath0 .",
    "however , as discussed previously , the lt codes can adjust their rates for each channel condition and have ( with a good approximation ) minimum energy consumption for every distance @xmath0 .",
    "this indicates that lt codes can surpass the above distance constraint for wsn applications with dynamic position sensor nodes over rayleigh fading channels .",
    "this characteristic of lt codes results in reducing the complexity of the network design as well . of interest is the strong benefits of using lt coded nc - mfsk compared with the coded modulation schemes in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to classical fixed - rate codes used in @xcite , the lt codes can vary their block lengths to adapt to any channel condition in each distance @xmath0 .",
    "unlike @xcite and @xcite , where the authors consider fixed - rate codes over an awgn channel model , we considered a rayleigh fading channel which is a general model in practical wsns .",
    "the simplicity and flexibility advantages of lt codes with an nc - mfsk scheme make them the preferable choice for wireless sensor networks , in particular for wsns with dynamic position sensor nodes .",
    "in this paper , we analyzed the energy efficiency of lt coded nc - mfsk in a proactive wsn over rayleigh fading channels with path - loss .",
    "it was shown that the energy efficiency of lt codes is similar to that of uncoded nc - mfsk scheme for @xmath15 , while for @xmath16 , lt coded nc - mfsk outperforms other uncoded and coded schemes , from the energy efficiency point of view .",
    "this result follows from the flexibility of the lt code to adjust its rate and the corresponding lt coding gain to suit instantaneous channel conditions for any transmission distance @xmath0 .",
    "this rate flexibility offers strong benefits in using lt codes in practical wsns with dynamic distance and position sensors . in such systems and for every value of distance @xmath0",
    ", lt codes can adjust their rates to achieve a certain ber with low energy consumption .",
    "the importance of our scheme is that it avoids some of the problems inherent in adaptive coding or incremental redundancy ( ir ) systems ( channel feedback , large buffers , or multiple decodings ) , as well as the coding design challenge for fixed - rate codes used in wsns with dynamic position sensor nodes .",
    "the simplicity and flexibility advantages of lt codes make the lt code with nc - mfsk modulation can be considered as a _ green modulation / coding _ ( gmc ) scheme in dynamic wsns .",
    "for the sink circuitry , we have an extra energy cost due to the decoding process in a coded nc - mfsk scheme .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the energy consumption of an bch@xmath17 decoder per codeword , denoted by @xmath18 , is computed as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 represent the energy consumptions of adder and multiplier in unit of w / mhz , respectively .",
    "for instance , the energy consumption of 0.5 @xmath22w / mhz indicates that the consumed energy per clock cycle is 0.5 pj .",
    "thus , if for decoding of each bit we consider 20 clock cycles , the energy consumption is 10 pj / bit . for this case ,",
    "the total energy consumption a bch@xmath17 decoder to recover @xmath23-bit message @xmath24 is obtained as @xmath25 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the energy consumption per addition or multiplication operation is on the order of pj per bit . according to the values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 in table",
    "ii , one can with a good approximation assume that the energy consumption of an bch decoder is negligible compared to the other circuit components in the sink node .",
    "the proof of the remark is straightforward using the notation of @xcite and the bipartite graph concepts in graph theory .",
    "obviously , the output - node degree distribution @xmath28 induces a distribution on the input nodes in the bipartite graph .",
    "thus , in the asymptotic case of @xmath29 , we have the input - node degree distribution defined as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denotes the probability that an input node has a degree @xmath32 . in this case , the average degree of the input and output nodes are computed as @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively . thus , the number of edges exiting the input nodes of the bipartite graph , in the asymptotic case of @xmath29 , is @xmath35 , which must be equal to @xmath36 , the number of edges entering the output nodes in the graph . as a results ,",
    "the asymptotic lt code rate is obtained as @xmath37 , which is a deterministic value for given @xmath28 and @xmath38 .",
