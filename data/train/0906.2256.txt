    "<S> an all non - optical method for accurately determining the pulse parameters of individual few - cycle laser shots is presented . by analyzing the  left \" and  right \" asymmetry of high - energy photoelectrons along the polarization axis using the recently developed quantitative rescattering theory , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the carrier - envelope phase , the pulse duration and the peak intensity of each single - shot pulse can be readily retrieved . unlike optical measurements , this method provides the laser intensity in the interaction region directly .    </S>",
    "<S> observation of the interaction of laser pulses with matter requires the knowledge of the waveform of the laser field . </S>",
    "<S> the waveform is characterized by its pulse envelope , including peak intensity and pulse duration , as well as the carrier - envelope phase ( cep ) which measures the offset between the peak of the electric field and the peak of the envelope . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , such a cep - fixed waveform can be written as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the frequency of the carrier wave , @xmath2 is the cep .    </S>",
    "<S> the stabilization of the cep is of great importance , for example , in the generation of isolated attosecond xuv pulses  @xcite , and in controlling the dissociation dynamics of molecules  @xcite . for atomic targets , </S>",
    "<S> the cep affects the relative yield of high - energy above - threshold - ionization ( hati ) electrons along the left vs the right directions of the polarization axis , and the ratio of the left / right photoelectron yield has been used for the determination of the cep of few - cycle pulses  @xcite . in such measurements </S>",
    "<S> the cep of a laser beam must be stabilized . however , the stabilization of the cep is rather complex . </S>",
    "<S> it is often determined by averaging over the jitters from many laser shots , thus limiting the temporal resolution of  cep - stabilized \" pulses . </S>",
    "<S> recently , wittmann _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_.  @xcite reported that the left / right photoelectrons from individual shots can be measured . in this letter , we show that based on the recently developed quantitative rescattering ( qrs ) theory  @xcite , the cep , the pulse duration , together with the peak intensity at the laser focus , can all be accurately determined simultaneously from the measured electron momentum spectra , thus providing a complete non - optical method for the full characterization of each few - cycle laser shot . </S>",
    "<S> the method is robust and the laser pulses can be characterized within a few hours using typical personal computers .    from the qrs  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the momentum distributions of hati electrons can be expressed as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the returning electron wave packet and @xmath5 is the elastic differential cross section ( dcs ) between the field - free electrons and the target ion . </S>",
    "<S> the qrs is a quantitative version of the well - known rescattering model  @xcite . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> electrons which are released earlier in the laser field may be driven back to recollide with the target ion . in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ qrs ] ) , the momentum @xmath6 of the returning wave packet ( not directly measured ) is related to the measured photoelectron momentum @xmath7 via @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the vector potential of the laser field at the time of recollision . in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ prar ] ) , the upper sign refers to the right side while the lower sign refers to the left side . </S>",
    "<S> ( all the equations are written in atomic units unless otherwise noted . ) following the qrs  @xcite , the magnitude of @xmath9=@xmath10 . the angles @xmath11 and @xmath12 are defined with respect to the laser polarization axis , and @xmath12 is measured from the direction of the  incident beam \" , i.e. , of the returning electrons . for hati electrons along the polarization axis , @xmath11=0 ( right ) or @xmath13 ( left ) , @xmath12=@xmath13 , and @xmath7=@xmath14=@xmath15 .    according to the qrs  @xcite , the wave packet @xmath4 depends mostly on the lasers only , while the dcs is solely the property of the target . </S>",
    "<S> due to this separability the experimental hati spectra can also be written as the product of a volume - integrated  wave packet \" @xmath16 with the dcs  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for each pulse , there are two returning wave packets , one from the left , the other from the right , along the polarization axis . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) shows the  left \" and  right \" electron spectra from a typical single - shot measurement . </S>",
    "<S> using @xmath17 , where @xmath18 for atomic targets are easily calculated , for example , the right wave packet can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> similarly a left wave packet @xmath19 can also be obtained . by comparing these  experimental \" wave packets with </S>",
    "<S> those @xmath16 obtained theoretically , the laser parameters used in the experiment are retrieved . since the wave packet in the qrs </S>",
    "<S> is obtained from strong field approximation , the calculation is a few thousands times faster than from solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> this speed - up makes it possible to carry out near real - time retrieval of laser parameters from experimental data . to perform volume integration , </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the spatial distribution of each laser shot is gaussian and all the electrons from the interaction volume are collected . </S>",
    "<S> thus only the peak intensity at the laser focus and its pulse length ( defined as the full - width at half - maximum of the intensity ) , in addition to the cep , will be retrieved . </S>",
    "<S> we also assume that the peak intensity and pulse duration of each individual shot do not change , i.e. , only the cep is changed randomly . </S>",
    "<S> the wavelength is assumed to be known .    in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , 4500 single - shot data were collected . </S>",
    "<S> we first determine the peak intensity and pulse duration used in the experiment . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> , we define a single quantity called energy moment @xmath20 for each shot , @xmath21 where the momentum @xmath6 of the returning electron is related to the momentum @xmath7 along the polarization axis ( and energy @xmath22 ) by @xmath7=1.79@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , from the experimental electron spectra like fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ( or better the spectra summed over all the shots , on the left or on the right ) we estimate @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where @xmath23 is close to about 5@xmath25 and @xmath24 is about 10@xmath25 , where @xmath25 is the ponderomotive energy . </S>",
    "<S> these selections are made since the qrs is valid only for hati electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the precise values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 are not important . using the left wave packet for all the 4500 shots , 4500 values of @xmath20 s </S>",
    "<S> are calculated from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ moment ] ) , using fixed @xmath23 and @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> these calculated values are displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) where the horizontal axis is divided into 90 sections . </S>",
    "<S> the moments @xmath20 calculated from the first 50 shots are placed in the first bin , at the vertical positions corresponding to the values of @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath20 s from the next 50 shots are placed in the second bin . </S>",
    "<S> the process continues till the energy moments from all the shots are registered . </S>",
    "<S> note that the @xmath20 s are distributed nearly uniformly within a band . </S>",
    "<S> the average value of @xmath20 , or @xmath26 , was calculated to be 16.46 ev and was found to be independent of the pulse duration . using the qrs , the @xmath26 values ( averaged over the whole 2@xmath13 range of the cep ) </S>",
    "<S> were found to be 15.64 , 16.05 and 16.46 ev , respectively , for peak intensities of 1.2 , 1.3 and @xmath27 w/@xmath28 . by choosing peak intensity at @xmath27 w/@xmath28 , and for pulse durations of 4.5 , 4.7 and 5.0 fs , </S>",
    "<S> respectively , we found that the best fit to the ( vertical ) band width is for pulse duration of about 4.6  fs , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the energy moments calculated over the single shots allow the determination of the peak intensity and pulse duration easily .    in the above analysis , only the energy moments from the left wave packets were considered . </S>",
    "<S> if the right and left detectors are exactly identical , then the same peak intensity and pulse duration should be obtained from the right wave packets . from figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(c , d ) , it is clear that the two detectors are not exactly the same . if we were to use the data from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(d ) , we would obtain a peak intensity of @xmath29 w/@xmath28 and pulse duration of 4.8  fs . </S>",
    "<S> we checked that these conclusions are not changed much when the values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 are varied .    </S>",
    "<S> once the peak intensity and pulse duration are known , we retrieve the cep for each shot following the procedure of wittmann _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_.  @xcite . in their method , between @xmath23 and @xmath24 , </S>",
    "<S> another intermediate energy @xmath30 was chosen ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the total electron yield @xmath31 between @xmath23 and @xmath30 from the left detector is evaluated , and a @xmath32 from the right detector in the same energy range is calculated . </S>",
    "<S> define the asymmetry @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> a similar asymmetry parameter @xmath34 is defined for the electron yields between @xmath30 and @xmath24 . using ( @xmath35)=(37.9 , 57.5 , 64.8 ) ev as in wittmann _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_.  @xcite , the ( @xmath36 ) for each laser shot is plotted as a point in 2d , and the results for all the shots are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) . on top of the plot , </S>",
    "<S> three theoretical curves are shown , for peak intensity of @xmath27 w/@xmath28 and pulse durations of 4.5 , 4.7 and 5.0  fs , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> from the three curves , a duration of 4.7  fs gives the best overall fit to the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> this number happens to be the average of 4.6 fs and 4.8  fs derived from fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the theory curve is simply a lissajous parameter plot of @xmath37 and @xmath34 , versus the implicit variable , the cep . </S>",
    "<S> the theory expects a perfect ellipse . due to the intrinsic errors in experimental electron spectra , </S>",
    "<S> the experimental  ellipse \" acquires a width , and the ellipse is distorted due to the difference in the left and right detectors .    </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the ellipse depends on the choice of ( @xmath35 ) used in the calculation of @xmath37 and @xmath34 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) , we show another choice of these parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the size and the orientation of the ellipse are changed . however , the actual retrieved cep s are insensitive to such choices . </S>",
    "<S> take laser shots , # 829 , # 1138 and # 4000 as examples . </S>",
    "<S> we retrieve the cep by drawing a straightline from ( @xmath38)=(@xmath39 ) to the experimental point ( marked by large yellow dots ) . from the intercept of this line with the theoretical curve , we read out the cep . </S>",
    "<S> for these three shots we found their cep values are 129@xmath40 , 279@xmath40 and 16@xmath40 , respectively , with an error of about 3@xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> no effort was made to optimize the choices of the three energy points .    to illustrate that the cep of each laser shot indeed varies randomly </S>",
    "<S> , we show the retrieved cep for shot numbers from 1000 to 1050 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly the cep varies randomly from shot to shot .    </S>",
    "<S> the present method can also be used to determine the cep of the  phase - stabilized \" laser pulses . </S>",
    "<S> we have electron momentum spectra from kling _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_.  @xcite . from their hati electron momentum spectra </S>",
    "<S> , we deduced that the peak intensity is @xmath41 w/@xmath28 and the pulse duration is 5.0  fs . </S>",
    "<S> the mean wavelength of the laser used was 738 nm . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) , we show the parametric plots using ( @xmath35)= ( 10.0 , 13.0 , 20.0 ) ev for the 19 measured points . </S>",
    "<S> the  size \" of the ellipse is about the same as in fig .  2 since the pulse duration of 5.0 fs is close to the 4.7  fs in fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the scattering of the experimental data points from the theoretical ellipse is much larger for these  phase - stabilized \" laser pulses . </S>",
    "<S> this large scattering reflects the lack of good phase stabilization . as shown in wittmann _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_. , performing single - shot measurements on these  phase - stabilized \" pulses shows shot - to - shot cep variations up to about 20@xmath40 . using the present method to retrieve the cep </S>",
    "<S> , we found that the retrieved cep depends more sensitively on the values of ( @xmath42 ) used in the analysis , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4(b ) , where two sets of energy values were used to obtain the cep for each measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the straightline in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4(b ) was drawn so that the line best fits the deduced cep s from successive measurements . </S>",
    "<S> on the whole the phase decreases as the  shot number \" increases , thus the phase has been stabilized at least partially .    </S>",
    "<S> the determination of cep is easier for shorter pulses . </S>",
    "<S> previously , kling _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_.  @xcite reported hati electron momentum spectra for longer pulses . </S>",
    "<S> their data were analyzed by micheau _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_.  @xcite earlier , also using the qrs , but the method assumed that cep differences between successive measurements are constant . </S>",
    "<S> for this same set of data , micheau _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_. found a pulse length of 6.7  fs and peak intensity of @xmath43 w/@xmath28 . using the present method we analyzed the 40  shots \" from kling _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_.  @xcite , and found that the pulse length is 7.0 fs and the peak intensity is @xmath43 w/@xmath28 , close to the values from micheau _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_.  @xcite . for these longer pulses , </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetries @xmath37 and @xmath34 are much smaller , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> due to the remaining jittering of the phase stabilized pulses from shot to shot , the scattering of the experimental asymmetries around the theory ellipse are much larger . </S>",
    "<S> for the ten measurements over the 2@xmath13 range , we notice again that the retrieved cep s depend more sensitively on the ( @xmath42 ) used for the retrieval , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4(d ) , similarly to what was observed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4(b ) .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , using the recently developed quantitative rescattering theory , we propose an all - non - optical method to efficiently retrieve accurate peak laser intensity , pulse duration and the cep of each single laser shot from the measured high - energy ati electron spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the method is very robust . </S>",
    "<S> the computational effort is very small and requires no iterations . unlike wittmann _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_.  @xcite , we show that there is no need to retrieve the peak intensity and pulse duration using the optical method . in the future </S>",
    "<S> , cep dependence measurements can be carried out using non - phase - stabilized lasers . by simple cep </S>",
    "<S> tagging , the strong - field effects on the waveform of ultrashort pulses can be accurately carried out to achieve temporal resolution of a few attoseconds . </S>",
    "<S> the present all - non - optical method also characterizes the laser pulses in the interaction region directly and avoid errors introduced by the propagation of the laser beam . </S>"
