    "since the first observation by grnberg _",
    "@xcite of antiferromagnetic coupling of fe films separated by a cr spacer , the interlayer exchange interaction between ferromagnetic layers separated by a non - magnetic spacer has been a subject of intense research in the last few years .",
    "the decisive stimulus came from the discovery , by parkin _",
    "@xcite , of _ oscillations _ of the interlayer exchange coupling in fe / cr / fe and co / ru / co multilayers , as a function of spacer thickness .",
    "furthermore , parkin @xcite showed that this spectacular phenomenon occurs with almost any metal as a spacer material .",
    "this review will be restricted to the case of interlayer coupling across non - magnetic metallic spacer layers .",
    "this excludes the cases of non - metallic spacer @xcite , of antiferromagnetic spacer such as cr or mn @xcite and of rare - earth multilayers @xcite .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that the physical mechanism of the coupling in these cases is quite different from the one to be discussed here .",
    "the magnetic coupling energy per unit area can usually be expressed as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the angle between the magnetizations of the two magnetic layers , and @xmath3 is called the interlayer coupling coupling constant .",
    "higher order terms in an expansion in powers of @xmath4 are also observed ; such terms , which give rise to non - collinear alignment of the magnetizations , are believed to be of non intrinsic origin and to be related to defects such as roughness @xcite .",
    "such effects will not be considered here .",
    "in addition , due to space limitation , the important question of the role of alloy disorder and interdiffusion @xcite will not be addressed .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present as simply as possible the mechanism of interlayer exchange coupling in terms of quantum interferences due to electron confinement in the spacer layer .",
    "the understanding of this mechanism relies on ideas due to various authors @xcite .",
    "the presentation give here is based on the one of ref .",
    "the emphasis will be on physical concepts and pedagogical clarity rather than on mathematical rigor .",
    "it is organized as follows : in the next section , an elementary discussion of quantum confinement is given ; in section [ sec : ixc ] , it is then shown how spin - dependent confinement in the spacer layer gives rise to interlayer exchange coupling ; section [ sec : asympt ] is devoted to the limit of large spacer thicknesses , for which particularly simple results are obained ; sections [ sec : maglayer ] and [ sec : overlayer ] treat the variation of interlayer exchange coupling with magnetic layer thickness and non - magnetic overlayer thickness , respectively ; finally , in section [ sec : strength ] the strength of the interlayer exchange coupling is discussed in comparison with experimental data .",
    "the point of view adopted here reflects the author s subjective views on the topic .",
    "in particular , due to space limitation , the important literature devoted to _ ab initio _ calculation will not be discussed in detail here .",
    "the interested reader can find complementary information in the various review papers on this subject which have been published recently @xcite .",
    "for the sake of clarity , we shall first consider an extremely simplified model , namely the one - dimensional quantum well , which nevertheless contains the essential physics involved in the problem .",
    "then , we shall progressively refine the model in order to make it more realistic .",
    "the model consists in a one - dimensional quantum well representing the spacer layer ( of potential @xmath5 and width @xmath6 ) , sandwiched between two `` barriers '' @xmath7 and @xmath8 of respective widths @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and respective potentials @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "note that we use the term `` barrier '' in a general sense , i.e. , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are not necessarily positive .",
    "furthermore , the barrier widths , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , can be finite or infinite , without any restriction .",
    "let us consider an electron of wavevector @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 ) propagating towards the right in the spacer layer ; as this electrons arrives on barrier @xmath8 , it is partially reflected to the left , with a ( complex ) anplitude @xmath15 is in turn reflected on barrier @xmath7 with an amplitude @xmath16 , an so on .",
    "; however , this property will generally not hold for three - dimensional systems to be studied below . ]",
    "the module @xmath17 of the reflection coefficient expresses the magnitude of the reflected wave , whereas the argument @xmath18 represents the phase shift due to the reflection ( note that the latter is not absolutely determined and depends on the choice of the coodinate origin ) .",
    "the interferences between the waves due to the multiple reflections on the barriers induce a modification of the density of states in the spacer layer , for the electronic state under consideration .",
    "the phase shift resulting from a complete round trip in the spacer is @xmath19 with @xmath20 if the interferences are constructive , i.e. , if @xmath21 with @xmath22 an integer , one has an increase of the density of states ; conversely , if the interferences are destructive , i.e. , if @xmath23 one has a reduction of the density of states .",
    "thus , in a first approximation , we expect the modification of the density of states in the spacer , @xmath24 , to vary with @xmath6 like @xmath25 furthermore , we expect that this effect will proportional to the amplitude of the reflections on barriers @xmath7 and @xmath8 , i.e. , to @xmath26 ; finally , @xmath24 must be proportional to the width @xmath6 of the spacer and to the density of states per unit energy and unit width , @xmath27 which includes a factor of @xmath28 for spin degenaracy",
    ". we can also include the effect of higher order interferences due to @xmath22 round trips in the spacer ; the phase shift @xmath29 is then multiplied by @xmath22 and @xmath26 is replaced by @xmath30 .",
    "gathering all the terms , we get , @xmath31 as will appear clearly below , it is more convenient to consider the integrated density of states @xmath32 the modification @xmath33 of the integrated density of states due to electron confinement is @xmath34 a simple graphical interpretation of the above expression can be obtained by noting that @xmath35 , for @xmath36 complex ; thus , @xmath37 is given by the argument , in the complex plane , of a point located at an angle @xmath38 on a circle of radius @xmath26 centred in 1 . this graphical construction is shown in [ fig : graphic ] .",
    "the variation of @xmath37 as a function of @xmath6 is shown in [ fig : deltan ] , for various values of the confinement strength @xmath26 . for weak confinement ( a )",
    ", @xmath37 varies with @xmath6 in sinusoidal manner .",
    "as one increases the confinement strength ( b ) , the oscillations are distorded , due to higher order interferences .",
    "finally , for full confinement ( c ) , @xmath37 exhibits some jumps that correspond to the appearance of bound states .",
    "we note however , that the period @xmath39 of the oscillations of @xmath40 does not depend on the confinement strength , but only on the wavevector @xmath41 , namely , @xmath42 .",
    "so far , we have implicitely restricted ourselves to positive energy states .",
    "negative energy states ( i.e. , of imaginary wavevector ) are forbidden in absence of the barriers @xmath7 and @xmath8 , because their amplitude diverges either on the right hand side or on the left hand side , so that they can not be normalized .",
    "this matter of fact no longer holds in the presence of the barriers if @xmath11 ( or @xmath12 , or both @xmath11 and @xmath43 ) is negative : the negative energy states , i.e. , varying exponentially in the spacer , can be connected to allowed states of @xmath7 or @xmath8 . in order to treat these states consistently",
    ", we simply have to extend the concept of reflection coefficient to to states of imaginary wavevector , which is straightforward .",
    "one can check that , with this generalization , ( [ eq : th : deltan ] ) acounts properly for the contribution of the evanescent states .",
    "physically , this can be interpretated as a coupling of @xmath7 and @xmath8 by tunnel effect @xcite ..",
    "let us now study the modification of the energy of the system due to the quantum interferences . in order to conserve the total number of electrons ,",
    "it is convenient to work within the grand - canonical ensemble , and to consider the thermodynamic grand - potential , which is given by @xmath44 \\",
    ",   n(\\varepsilon ) \\ , \\rmd\\varepsilon \\nonumber \\\\ & = & - \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } n(\\varepsilon ) \\ , f(\\varepsilon)\\ ,   \\rmd\\varepsilon .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at @xmath45 , this reduces to @xmath46 the energy @xmath47 associated with the interferences is the contribution to @xmath48 corresponding to @xmath37 , @xmath49      the generalization of the above discussion to the more realistic case of a three - dimensional layered system is immediate . since the system is invariant by translation parallely to the plane",
    ", the in - plane wavevector @xmath50 is a good quantum number .",
    "thus , for a given @xmath50 , one has an effective one - dimensional problem analogous to the one discussed above .",
    "the resulting effect of quantum intereferences is obtained by summing on @xmath50 over the two - dimensional brillouin zone .",
    "the modification of integrated density of states per unit area is @xmath51 and the interference energy per unit area is @xmath52      the case of a thin overlayer deposited on a substrate is of considerable interest . in this case , one of the barriers ( say , @xmath7 ) consists of the vacuum , and barrier @xmath8 is constituted by the substrate itself .",
    "the potential of the vacuum barrier is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the the work function ; thus it is perfectly reflecting for occupied states , i.e. , @xmath55 . on the other hand ,",
    "the reflection on the substrate ( or coefficent @xmath56 ) may be total or partial , depending on the band matching for the state under consideration .",
    "the spectral density of the occupied states in the overlayer can be investigated experimentally by photoemission spectroscopy ; in addition , by using inverse photoemission , one can study the unoccupied states .",
    "if furthermore these techniques are used in the `` angle - resolved '' mode , they give information on the spectral density _ locally in the @xmath50 plane_.    for a given thickness of the overlayer , the photoemission spectra ( either direct or inverse ) exhibit some maxima and minima corresponding , respectively , to the energies for which the interferences are constructive and destructive .",
    "when the confinement is total , narrow peaks can be observed , which correspond to the quantized confined states in the overlayer , as was pointed out by loly and pendry @xcite .",
    "quantum size effects due to electron confinement in the photoemission spectra of overlayers have been observed in various non - magnetic systems @xcite . in particular , the systems au(111)/ag / vacuum and cu(111)/ag / vacuum offer excellent examples of this phenomenon @xcite .",
    "so far our discussion concerned exclusively non - magnetic systems .",
    "qualitatively new behavior can be expected when some of the layers are ferromagnetic . a case of particular interest",
    "is the one of a paramagnetic overlayer on a ferromagnetic substrate .    in the interior of the overlayer ,",
    "the potential is independent of the spin ; therefore the propagation of electrons is described by a wavevector @xmath57 which is spin - independent .",
    "the reflection coefficient on the vacuum barrier , @xmath58 , is also spin - independent .",
    "however , the ferromagnetic substrate constitutes a spin - dependent potential barrier ; thus , the substrate reflection coefficients for electrons with a spin parallel to the majority and minority spin directions of the substrate , respectively @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "it is convenient to define the spin average @xmath61 and the spin asymmetry @xmath62 in this case , the electron confinement in the overlayer gives rise to a spin - dependent modulation of the spectral density versus overlayer thickness ; the period of the modulation is the same for both spins , whereas the amplitude and phase are expected to be spin - dependent .",
    "the quantum size effects in paramagnetic overlayers on a ferromagnetic substrate have been investigated by several groups @xcite .",
    "the systems studied most are cu overlayers on a co(001 ) substrate and ag overlayers on a fe(001 ) substrate .",
    "ortega and himpsel @xcite observed a quantum size effect in the normal - emission photoelectron spectra of copper overlayer on fcc cobalt ( 001 ) substrate .",
    "they observed peaks due to quantum size effects both in the photoemission and in the inverse photoemission spectra an oscillation of the photoemission intensity .",
    "these quantum size effects manifest themselves also by an oscillatory behavior of the photoemission intensity at the fermi level ; as the observed oscillation period ( 5.9  atomic layers ) is close to the long period of interlayer exchange coupling oscillations in co / cu(001)/co , they suggested that the two phenomena should be related to each other ; they also claimed that the observed oscillations in photoemission are spin dependent and due mostly to minority electrons .",
    "a direct confirmation of this conjecture has been given independently by garrison _",
    "_ @xcite and by carbone _",
    "@xcite by means of spin - polarized photoemission .",
    "they found that both the intensity and the spin - polarization exhibit an oscillatory behavior with the same period ( 5  6 atomic layers ) , but have opposit phases , which indicates that the quantum size effect does indeed take place predominantly in the minority - spin band as proposed by ortega and himpsel @xcite .",
    "recently , klsges _",
    "_ @xcite and kawakami _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have observed spin - polarized quantum size effects in a copper overlayer on cobalt ( 001 ) for a non - zero in - plane wavevector corresponding to the short period oscillation of interlayer exchange coupling in co / cu(001)/co ; they observed short - period oscillations of the photoemission intensity in good agrement with the short - period oscillations of interlayer coupling .",
    "this observation provides a further confirmation of the relation between quantum size effects in photoemission and oscillation of interlayer exchange coupling .",
    "photoemission studies of quantum size effects have also been performed in other kinds of systems such as ferromagnetic overlayer on a non - magnetic substrate , or systems comprising more layers @xcite .",
    "photoemission spectroscopy undoubtly constitutes a method of choice for investigating quantum size effects in metallic overlayers : this is due to its unique features , which allow selectivity in energy , in - plane wavevector , and spin .    besides photemission ,",
    "spin - polarized quantum size effects in paramagnetic overlayers on a ferromagnetic substrate are also responsible for oscillatory behavior ( versus overlayer thickness ) of spin - polarized secondary electron emission @xcite , linear @xcite and non - linear @xcite magneto - optical kerr effect , and magnetic anisotropy @xcite .",
    "however , these effects usually involve a summation over all electronic states , so that the quantitative analysis of the quantum size effects may be fairly complicated .",
    "let us now consider the case of a paramagnetic layer sandwiched between two ferromagnetic barriers @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "now , the reflection coefficients on both sides of the paramagnetic spacer layer are spin dependent .",
    "_ a priori _ the angle @xmath2 between the magnetizations of the two ferromagnetic can take any value ; however , for the sake of simplicity , we shall restrict ourselves here to the ferromagnetic ( f ) configuration ( ie . , @xmath63 ) and the antiferromagnetic ( af ) one ( i.e. , @xmath64 ) .    for the ferromagnetic configuration",
    ", the energy change per unit area due to quantum interference is easily obtained from ( [ eq : th : qse - energy-3d ] ) , i.e. , @xmath65 \\ , \\rmd\\varepsilon \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this equation , the first and the second term correspond respectively to majority- and minority - spin electrons .",
    "the antiferromagnetic conguration is obtained by reversing the magnetization of @xmath8 , i.e. , by interchanging @xmath66 and @xmath67 ; thus the corresponding energy per unit area is @xmath68 \\ , \\rmd\\varepsilon \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the interlayer exchange coupling energy is @xmath69 \\",
    ", \\rmd\\varepsilon \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be simplified as @xmath70 in the limit of weak confinement .",
    "the above expression for the iec has a rather transparent physical interpretation .",
    "first , as the integrations on * k*@xmath71 over the first two - dimensional brillouin zone and on the energy up to the fermi level show , the iec is a sum of contributions from all occupied electronic states .",
    "the contribution of a given electronic state , of energy @xmath72 and in - plane wavevector * k*@xmath71 , consists of the product of three factors : the two factors @xmath73 and @xmath74 express the spin - asymmetry of the confinement due to the magnetic layers @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , while the exponential factor @xmath75 describes the propagation through the spacer and is responsible for the interference ( or quantum size ) effect .",
    "thus , this approach establishes an explicit and direct link between oscillatory iec and quantum size effects such as observed in photoemission .",
    "in the limit of large spacer thickness @xmath6 , the exponential factor oscillates rapidly with @xmath72 and * k*@xmath71 , which leads to substantial cancellation of the contributions to the iec due to the different electronic states .",
    "however , because the integration over energy is abruptly stopped at @xmath76 , states located at the fermi level give predominant contributions .",
    "thus the integral on @xmath72 may be calculated by fixing all other factors to their value at @xmath76 , and by expanding @xmath77 around @xmath76 , i.e. , @xmath78 with @xmath79 the integration ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) yields @xmath80 where @xmath81 in the above equations , @xmath82 is a vector spanning the _ complex fermi surface _ ; the velocity @xmath83 is a combination of the group velocities at the points @xmath84 and @xmath85 of the fermi surface .    next , the integration on @xmath86 is performed by noting , that , for large spacer thickness @xmath6 , the only significant contributions arise from the neighboring of critical vectors @xmath87 for which @xmath82 is stationary . around such vectors ,",
    "@xmath82 may be expanded as @xmath88 where the crossed terms have been canceled by a proper choice of the @xmath89 and @xmath90 axes ; @xmath91 and @xmath92 are combinations of the curvature radii of the fermi surface at @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the integral is calculated by using the stationary phase approximation @xcite , and one obtains @xmath95 where @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 correspond to the critical vector @xmath100 , and @xmath101 in the above equation , one takes the square root with an argument between @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "this analysis shows that _ in fine _ , the only remaining contributions in the limit of large spacer thickness @xmath6 arise from the neighborhood of states having in - plane wavevectors * k*@xmath104 such that the spanning vector of the fermi surface @xmath105 is stationary with respect to * k*@xmath71 for * k*@xmath106*k*@xmath104 , and the corresponding contribution oscillates with a wavevector equal to @xmath107 .",

    "this discrepancy may be due to an error in the estimation of the curvature radius @xmath130 of the fermi surface , and of the fermi velocity @xmath131 , which are quite tricky to obtain accurately for @xmath132 .",
    "turning now to the comparison between theory and experiment , we notice that the calculated values of @xmath129 are considerably larger than the measured ones .",
    "at least two reasons can contribute to this discrepancy .",
    "the first one is the effect of interface roughness , which generally tends to reduce the amplitude of the coupling oscillations @xcite ; this effect is particularly pronounced for short - period oscillatory components , as is indeed confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the second reason is of intrinsic character : the theoretical values of @xmath129 given in table [ tab : amplitude ] correspond to the asymptotic limit , whereas the experimental data have been obtained for spacer thicknesses below 15  al . as appears clearly from fig .",
    "6a of ref .",
    "@xcite and from fig . 13 ( bottom ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , the asymptotic regime is attained only for thicknesses above 20 to 40 al ; below , the envelop of the oscillations deviates significantly from a @xmath133 behavior , and the apparent amplitude in the range relevant to experiments is typically a factor 2 smaller than the asymptotic amplitude .",
    "this preasymptotic correction is attributed to a strong energy dependence of @xmath134 @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss the long - period oscillatory component .",
    "as appears from table [ tab : amplitude ] , the situation is quite confusing : not only the various theoretical results disagree with each other , but some of them @xcite _ underestimate _ the coupling strength as compared to the experiment @xcite , a fact which can not be explained by the effect of roughness or interdiffusion .",
    "the long - period oscillatory component arises from the center @xmath135 of the two - dimensional brillouin zone . here",
    "again , for the same reason as above , one has @xmath136 .",
    "the minority - spin reflection coefficient , on the other hand , is considerably smaller than for the short - period oscillation , and one has @xmath137 @xcite , so that @xmath138 @xcite .",
    "this very small spin - dependent confinement explains the very small values of @xmath139 obtained by the authors which rely on the asymptotic expression ( [ eq : j_asympt ] ) obtained from the stationary phase approximation @xcite .",
    "however , as seen from fig . 2 of ref . @xcite and fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath140 increases very strongly with @xmath141 and full reflection is reached at a distance @xmath142 from @xmath135 ; indeed , the low reflectivity arises only in a narrow window around @xmath135 . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this gives rise to a strong preasymptotic correction , and explains why the stationary phase approximation approximation yields an _ underestimated _ value of @xmath139 . on the other hand , if the @xmath141 integration is performed without using the stationary phase approximation , as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , a much higher value of @xmath139 is obtained ; the latter is larger than the experimental one @xcite by a factor 2.5 , which seems plausible in view of the effect of roughness and interdiffusion .",
    "our knowledge of the phase of the oscillations is much more restricted as this aspect of the problem has attracted little attention so far , with the notable exception of the work of weber _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . on general grounds , in the case of total reflection ( as is the case for @xmath143 ) , one expects the phase to vary with magnetic layer thickness and/or with chemical nature of the magnetic layer ; conversely , for a case weak confinement ( as is the case for @xmath140 ) , one expects the phase to be almost invariant @xcite .",
    "these general trends are indeed confirmed experimentally by weber _",

    "this is due to the excellent lattice matching between au and bcc fe ( with rotating the cubic axes of the latter by 45@xmath152 ) , and to the availability of extremely smooth fe substrates ( whiskers ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the co / cu(001 ) case discussed above , for fe / au(001 ) , one has total reflection of minority - spin electrons both at @xmath132 ( short - period oscillation ) and @xmath153 ( long - period oscillation ) , and @xmath154 is almost independent of @xmath141 around these points , as appears clearly from fig .  1 of ref .",
    "therefore , the associated preasymptotic correction should not be very strong .    indeed , as is seen from table [ tab : amplitude ] , the predicted amplitudes are quite large , both for the short - period and long - period oscillatory components @xcite .",
    "these predictions are fairly well confirmed by state - of - the - art experimental studies @xcite , although the predicted amplitude of the long - period component is too large by a factor 6 .",
    "clearly , even for this almost ideal system , further work is required to achieve a satisfactory quantitative agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "as has been discussed in detail in this review , there is a great deal of experimental evidence that the mechanism of quantum confinement presented above is actually the appropriate one to explain the phenomenon of oscillatory interlayer exchange coupling .",
    "this mechanism is entirely based upon a picture of independent electrons .",
    "this may seem paradoxal at first sight , in view of the fact that exchange interactions are ultimately due to the coulomb interaction between electrons .",
    "in fact , this independent - electron picture can be be justified theoretically and is based upon the `` magnetic force theorem . '' a thorough discussion of this fundamental ( but somehow technical ) aspect of the problem is given elsewhere @xcite .    in spite of the successes encountered by the quantum confinement mechanism ,",
    "a number of questions remain to be clarify for a full understanding of the phenomenon . in particular",
    ", one needs to assess in a more quantitative manner than has been done so far the validity of the asymptotic expression ( [ eq : j_asympt ] ) ; a first attempt towards addressing this issue is given in ref . @xcite .",
