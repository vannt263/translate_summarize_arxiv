    "physical vapor deposition ( pvd ) processes , such as the well established cathodic arc evaporation ( cae ) and dc magnetron sputtering ( dc - ms ) , as well as the promising high power pulsed magnetron sputtering ( hppms , often referred to as hipims ) technology can be used for the production of hard protective coatings in corrosion and wear resistance applications @xcite . in this context",
    "a uniform layer of coating material is an essential requirement . to optimize industrial pvd processes in terms of the quality of the obtained coatings ,",
    "it is important to understand not only the discharge characteristics , but moreover to obtain a detailed picture of the neutral gas flow inside the reactor chamber .",
    "the governing parameter commonly used for the analysis and the characterization of the gas flow regime is the knudsen number @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 allows to approximately estimate the flow regime in a given setup by specifying the degree of gas rarefaction @xcite .",
    "it is commonly defined as the ratio of the mean free path @xmath2 to a representative ( but local ) spatial scale @xmath0 , @xmath3    in a gas in an equilibrium state with number density @xmath4 , the mean free path can be estimated by @xmath5 , where the hard sphere collision cross section @xmath6 may be used .",
    "a representative length scale @xmath0 can be chosen based on geometric considerations . moreover , following boyd et al .",
    "@xcite it can be defined through the normalized gradient of a local flow property @xmath7 by @xmath8 .",
    "bird suggests a choice of @xmath7 based on the mass density @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this is unfeasible for incompressible flows , which can be assumed in the case investigated ( with a low mach number of at maximum @xmath10 ) .",
    "thus we choose the momentum as the characteristic flow property @xmath11 .",
    "this choice of _ kn _ based on either the geometric or the gradient approach is addressed in a later context .    regarding the analysis of the flow regime based on @xmath1 ,",
    "the following distinctions can be made :    for @xmath12 , continuum models based on the navier - stokes equations  usually implemented in computational fluid dynamic ( cfd ) simulations ",
    "allow for a precise description of the gas flow .",
    "such cfd models have found widespread applications in manifold areas of aerospace and automotive engineering @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in situations where @xmath13 the navier - stokes equations prove inadequate for the description of rarefied gas flows , e.g. , in micro / nano scale gas flows @xcite , or in gas flows commonly used in low pressure pvd applications .",
    "this is due to non - local effects in the multi dimensional velocity space , as well as inappropriate treatment of gas / wall interactions .",
    "moreover , in plasma processing a continuum representation ( implying a maxwell - boltzmann energy distribution ) is likely not valid , due to the interaction of neutral gas particles with non - equilibrium species ( heavy particle , or electrons ) , leading to an overall non - equilibrium situation . under rarefied conditions , in general ,",
    "only kinetic models based on the boltzmann equation provide an accurate description .",
    "such scenarios are often solved by means of the direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) method proposed by bird @xcite . at very low pressures where a stochastic description of the particle interaction with the background gas is justified ,",
    "the test particle monte carlo ( tpmc ) method @xcite is most commonly used . when using the dsmc method the boltzmann equation",
    "is directly solved by means of following the trajectory of a sufficiently large number of pseudo - particles subject to collisions among themselves , as well as with the surrounding walls .",
    "it is interesting to note that , although hydrodynamic and monte carlo methods have been studied extensively @xcite , generalized limitations for the validity of the different models in the transition regime @xmath14 are not given .",
    "the aim of this work is to discuss the validity of a conventional continuum model in the transition regime . for the analysis we apply the commercially available continuum fluid solver _ fluent",
    "in order to allow for a detailed comparison , we have modified  with respect to boundary conditions  the dsmc solver _ dsmcfoam _ @xcite . in this work",
    "we analyze the neutral gas flow inside a reactor chamber used for dc - ms and hppms processes .",
    "we present a brief description of the investigated reactor system and motivate our analysis of the two different numerical algorithms .",
    "we give a short review of both numerical models .",
    "a detailed discussion of simulation results of the identical vacuum setup obtained via the two models is provided .",
    "finally , the results are summarized and a conclusion is drawn .",
    "we provide suggestions on the validity of either continuum solution based cfd simulations and kinetic models .",
    "the cemecon cc800/9 custom coating unit , investigated in this work , is typically used for dc - ms and hppms processes . as illustrated in figure [ fig:3d_geometry ] ,",
    "the main processing chamber has a floor space of @xmath15 @xmath16 .",
    "additionally , the main chamber is extended towards the pump by a narrowing pump chamber .",
    "while the gas inlets ( a ) are along two of the corners of the main chamber at the left side , the pump ( e ) is mounted at the large flange at the right side . inside the main chamber",
    "there are six sample holders ( c ) .",
    "these sample holders can be static or rotating using a planetary gearing . behind the sample holders two magnetron cathodes ( b ) are mounted .",
    "the main chamber and the pump chamber are separated by a heater ( d ) .",
    "the coating unit is typically operated at pressures around 0.5 pa . for this study",
    "we assume that argon is used as process gas at a flow rate of @xmath17 sccm , while ( molecular ) nitrogen is used as reactive gas at a flow rate of @xmath18 sccm .",
    "all walls are assumed to have a constant temperature of @xmath19 k.     from geometric considerations , the typical geometric dimension @xmath0 ranges from about one centimeter ( e.g. , at small features , the substrates and cathodes ) up to a few tens of centimeters ( at open space in the vacuum chamber ) .",
    "additionally , for the pressure of 500 mpa , a mean free path of @xmath20 cm can be approximated for an equilibrium gas assuming a molecular diameter of @xmath21 for argon @xcite . in consequence , one finds the knudsen number @xmath22 in the limits @xmath23 . while the lower limit suggests that continuum models can be readily used for a numerical analysis , the upper limit enforces that only a kinetic treatment of particles is valid for a description of the gas flow . in the transition regime , however , no definite statement can be made .",
    "therefore , to gain insight in the gas flow  and the models  an investigation of results from a continuum model based on the navier - stokes equations , as well as a kinetic dsmc simulation model , is desired .",
    "the modeling of magnetron sputtering processes , involving the interaction of plasma with neutral background gas ( in this work argon and molecular nitrogen ) , as well as the interaction of heavy particles with target materials ( sputtering ) and walls / substrates ( deposition ) is of very complex nature . several authors have investigated the theoretical background of sputtering processes in terms of the plasma / wall interaction @xcite , the description of the deposition of sputtered material on substrates and walls ( including the chemical interaction with gas phase species ) @xcite , as well as the analysis of the plasma , particularly for hppms processes @xcite . the numerical investigations are often based on particle based models @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we concentrate on the neutral gas flow ; the interaction of the neutral gas with charged particles from the plasma , energetic heavy particles sputtered off the targets ( e.g. , gas rarefaction effects ) @xcite , as well as the resulting interaction with the walls ( i.e. , the deposition process ) are intentionally left for a later analysis . for our analysis",
    "we employ the cfd software _",
    "fluent _ and a modified version of the dsmc implementation _ dsmcfoam _ provided with the freely available _ openfoam _ simulation package @xcite .    for the cfd simulations ,",
    "the _ fluent _ software release 14 @xcite is used .",
    "we simulate the gas flow using a pressure based fluid model using the piso method @xcite .",
    "additional we use a rng k - epsilon turbulence model @xcite for robust convergence . for further improvement of the numerical solution scheme ,",
    "two neighbor and two skewness correction iterations are applied , respectively .",
    "the ideal gas law is used to obtain the gas density from the pressure and the gas temperature .",
    "the walls are described by slip boundary conditions . as for the parameters , we set a mass flux and the wall temperature corresponding to the flow rate and temperature specified in the setup description .",
    "we further set the boundary condition at the pump to @xmath24 mpa .",
    "the dsmc method is based on the idea that a sufficiently large number of pseudo - particles ( also referred to as simulators ) is kinetically simulated , interacting among each other by means of a given set of collision processes @xcite . in this ensemble ( here in the converged state approximately 8 million simulators ) , each pseudo - particle represents a large number of physical particles , in our case @xmath25 . by the original authors of _ dsmcfoam",
    "_ , the solver was benchmarked against a number of examples from the literature @xcite and was used for various studies of rarefied gas flow @xcite . in version 2.1.1 used for this analysis , the implementation provides a simulation tool with the capabilities for arbitrary 2d/3d geometries , an arbitrary number of gas species , variable hard sphere ( vhs ) collisions , larsen - borgnakke internal energy redistribution , and it allows for unlimited parallel processing @xcite .",
    "the original code has been modified to allow for appropriate boundary conditions for both gas species in the present problem : at the gas inlets mass flow rates are specified and at the outlet / pump an absorption probability allows to indirectly assign the pressure inside the vacuum chamber . if a particle hits the pump surface , with a probability @xmath26 it is removed from the simulation domain ; otherwise it is thermally re - emitted into the volume .",
    "this procedure is performed for both species , argon and molecular nitrogen , respectively . in consequence , the modified version of _ dsmcfoam _ allows to simulate the neutral gas flow inside arbitrary bounded geometries . regarding the specified parameters",
    ", we again assume a mass flux and wall temperature as presented above .",
    "further we set the absorption rate at the pump to a pressure - fitted value of @xmath27 . for the vhs collision cross sections we use the values suggested by @xcite .",
    "the larsen - borgnakke scheme for redistribution of internal energies is applied only to species with internal degrees of freedom available , which in our case  due to its diatomic nature ",
    "does affect only the molecular nitrogen .",
    "in addition , we assume complete thermalization of the particles once they impinge on the walls . to accurately describe the temporal and spatial dynamics",
    ", we apply a time - step size of @xmath28 @xmath29s ( a fraction of the mean collision time ) and a typical cell size of about @xmath30 cm ( at maximum approximately the mean free path ) .    due to the fundamental `` ab - initio '' treatment",
    "a dsmc model describes the gas flow in the transition regime more accurately compared to cfd models .",
    "this holds particularly for particle / wall interactions .",
    "this hypothesis will be verified in the next section , where we present 3d simulation results for the cc800/9 custom coating unit . for both numerical approaches",
    "the same geometry has been used .",
    "we start our analysis of the two different model approaches by comparing the spatial distribution of the mass flux ( or momentum ) calculated by the two models . in figure [ fig:3d_side ] the mass flux for both cases",
    "is indicated by the color - scaled streamlines . the quantitative agreement between both model results",
    "is well justified , as the mass flux through the chamber  in both cases  is imposed by the boundary conditions . the absolute mass flow integrated over the areas of the inlet or outlet ,",
    "respectively , is enforced to be exactly equal in both simulations .",
    "however , there is a substantial difference in the spatial distribution of the mass flow . in the cfd results a large `` eddy '' appears , circulating around the substrate holders . it can be argued that this circulation may be a physical phenomenon . as we investigate a steady state result",
    "it is not an immediate consequence of the turbulence model which has been used .",
    "furthermore , in comparison with the more fundamental dsmc simulations ( which naturally include turbulence ) it is clearly not observed . in principle",
    "one can well imagine that there are scenarios that involve large circulating flows .",
    "however in our case the kinetic model does exclude this possibility . in summary",
    "we conclude that a break down of the cfd model assumptions is observed . due to the externally imposed behavior of the total mass flow through the chamber ,",
    "the spatial distribution of the pressure is a more reliable indicator for our analysis . by considering a sectional plane along the direction of the @xmath31-axis , but in the center of the main vacuum chamber",
    ", a more detailed picture can be obtained .",
    "this is given in figure [ fig:2d_center ] .",
    "in the pressure profile calculated using the dsmc method a smooth decrease can be observed above the substrate holders ( @xmath32 cm ) .",
    "this region is characterized by open space and thus the flow is governed by a locally small knudsen number of @xmath33 .",
    "this suggests that the cfd method can predict a similar  and therefore physical  gas flow .",
    "the cfd results ( figure [ fig:2d_center ] , bottom ) the pressure drop in this region is also characterized by a smooth transition from the gas inlets ( left ) towards the pump ( right ) .",
    "in contrast , in the center region at the substrate holders ( @xmath34 cm ) , the dsmc results show a more distinct , but still smooth pressure drop . in this more `` crowded '' region",
    "the knudsen number is significantly larger , @xmath35 .",
    "a dynamic pressure occurs in front of the substrate holders and the flow bends around the obstacles . here",
    "the gas flow is dominated by particle / wall interactions .",
    "the results obtained by the cfd model show an obviously different pressure profile . strongly fluctuating  and most likely unphysical  gradients in the pressure profile can be found between the far left wall at the gas inlets and the substrate holders .",
    "it can be reasoned that these fluctuations are a direct consequence of the large circulating flow observed for the mass flux . on the basis of the arguments presented earlier , however , a physical explanation of these structures would be doubtful .",
    "this result suggests that , as expected , in regions of higher knudsen numbers the cfd model reaches the limits of its validity . by investigating figure",
    "[ fig:1d_center ] , where the pressure profiles for both approaches are exemplary extracted along two lines ( in the central plane above and between the substrate holders ) , this becomes even more evident . while the dsmc results ( figure [ fig:1d_center ] , top ) again suggest a smooth transition to lower pressures from the gas inlets towards the pump , the cfd results contradictory claim a smooth , but strongly fluctuating pressure profile",
    "this emphasizes the unphysical nature of the cfd results in regions of larger knudsen numbers .",
    "the results suggest that in regions where gas / wall interactions dominate , only kinetic models can accurately predict a physically correct gas flow .",
    "even more pronounced , this is observed directly at wall surfaces , where the gas flow is strongly distorted . in figure",
    "[ fig:2d_target ] , a plane parallel to the sectional plane of figure [ fig:2d_center ] is shown  but now at the cathodes .",
    "clearly , the effect of an incorrect treatment of the boundaries can be observed in the cfd simulations . at small features , e.g. , at the edges of the substrate holders , cathodes , or at the transition of the main to the pump chamber",
    ", numerical artifacts can be found .",
    "here the cfd model predicts steep gradients ( at the cathode surfaces ) and layer - like structures ( at the top and bottom , far right in the main vacuum chamber ) . in contrast , the dsmc results show physically smooth pressure gradients .",
    "this proves that the cfd model is well justified in regions of small and moderate knudsen numbers , but fails in regions where the gas flow is dominated by gas / wall interactions .",
    "an interesting aspect can be observed when investigating the energy distribution of a given gas species in the kinetic simulations and the maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) energy distribution , which is implicit in cfd models @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "the temperature is a direct quantitative measure of the energy distribution .",
    "in contrast , in kinetic models like the particle based dsmc method the energy distribution of a gas species can in principle have any shape .",
    "this is the main advantage of kinetic models .",
    "the shape is governed by all kinds of energy sources and/or sinks , e.g. , due to the interaction of neutral particles with energetic particles or due to energy accommodation at walls of different temperatures .    for the modeling and simulation of magnetron",
    "sputtering processes energy sources and sinks can be realized in terms of additional models ( e.g. , models of the plasma ) , or by inclusion of a flux of energetic non - equilibrium particles ( e.g. , sputtered particles ) . in this work , however , we concentrate on the neutral gas dynamics .",
    "( the coupling to a plasma model or the interaction with sputtered particles will be part of a subsequent study . )    as suggested by the boltzmann h - theorem @xcite , for a neutral gas flow without additional energy sources / sinks a mb energy distribution is the natural outcome . in figure [ fig:0d_particledistribution ]",
    "the energy distributions of ar and n@xmath36 particles sampled from the dsmc model in the center region at the substrate holders are given .",
    "the results are compared to an analytical evaluation of the mb distribution for a defined temperature of 300 k. the outcome of the fully kinetic simulations is in fact almost perfectly described by a mb energy distribution .",
    "due to disagreement of the results for macroscopic observables  the spatial particle distribution and the gas flow  in the cfd and the dsmc model , it can not be stated that the agreement of the energy distributions implies the validity of continuum methods . the validity is rather determined by the importance and accuracy of the gas / wall treatment , as well as non - local effects in energy space . in this respect a ( properly defined ) local knudsen number may be used . while a definition of the flow regime determined by the mass density gradient as proposed by bird @xcite can not always be applied ( e.g. , for incompressible flows ) , the gradient based definition with an appropriate choice of flow property ( e.g. , momentum ) , or a definition based on geometric considerations are reliable measures of the flow regime . both definitions",
    "have been specified earlier . to illustrate this the local knudsen number calculated from the momentum gradient of the dsmc results",
    "is plotted in figure [ fig:2d_knudsennumber ] .",
    "this gradient based knudsen number profile clearly highlights the problematic spots , providing detailed spatially resolved information about the flow regime .",
    "additionally , as can be seen from the range of values , there is very good quantitative agreement between the geometric estimate and the gradient based calculation .",
    "however , unlike geometric considerations , the gradient based definition can only be applied _",
    "after _ simulation results have been obtained , not _",
    "before_. consequently  with a careful choice of the flow property @xmath7  both definitions may be readily used to determine the flow regime . when a transitional or even rarefied gas flow is found , the correct physics can only be captured by means of a kinetic model approach . in such cases",
    "continuum methods are vaguely appropriate , only if the global flow behavior is of main interest , but not the detailed flow characteristics at small geometric features .",
    "in the present work the neutral gas flow under process conditions in the industrial scale pvd reactor cc800/9 custom is analyzed .",
    "the validity of a continuum model in the transition flow regime , characterized by a knudsen number ranging between @xmath23 ( based on geometric considerations ) , is investigated .",
    "in particular , the analysis was accomplished using the cfd simulation tool _",
    "fluent _ , as well as a modified version of the kinetic simulation tool _",
    "dsmcfoam_. while the results from the continuum model remain approximately valid only up to a knudsen number @xmath37 , the kinetic model is able to predict the physically correct gas flow in all flow regimes , also with larger knudsen numbers of @xmath38 .",
    "the kinetic approach provides a more precise description especially at small geometric features .",
    "in addition , it can be easily extended to particular model requirements . with respect to the modeling of deposition processes ( e.g. , dc - ms or hppms ) ,",
    "the sputtering process can be modeled , e.g. , by providing an initial thompson energy distribution paired with a cosine - law angular distribution for sputtered particles @xcite .",
    "moreover , for a deeper physical understanding , the kinetic model can be coupled to `` effective '' plasma models , or to a kinetic description of the ions , allowing for more complex and more complete energy exchange processes and chemical reactions .",
    "consequently , it allows for a detailed analysis of the coating formation on the substrates in industrial , as well as research pvd processes .",
    "it can be stated that only kinetic simulations are able to appropriately merge the physics of the gas flow , the particle / wall interactions and the particle / particle interactions in sputtering processes .",
    "the development of a particle based kinetic simulation of all heavy particles  neutrals and ions  similar to the particle in cell ( pic ) method @xcite will be the topic of a later study .",
