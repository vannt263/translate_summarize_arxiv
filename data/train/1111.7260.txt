    "the gerda  @xcite and majorana  @xcite experiments are designed to search for the neutrinoless double - beta ( @xmath1 ) decay of @xmath0ge using isotopically - enriched high - purity germanium ( hpge ) detectors .",
    "the experiments differ in basic approach and in the shielding philosophy for background suppression .",
    "detectors in gerda   are directly immersed in liquid argon , which acts both as cooling medium and as passive shielding against external @xmath2 radiation .",
    "the commissioning of gerda  was successfully completed and the phase  i data taking has recently started with eight hpge detectors enriched in @xmath0ge ( total mass of about 15  kg ) .",
    "the design adopted by majorana  consists in operating hpge detectors in an ultra - radiopure vacuum cryostat surrounded by passive lead shielding .",
    "the majorana   collaboration is currently constructing two modules of hpge detectors , with a total mass of about 40  kg of natural and enriched germanium , and is scheduled to begin data taking with the first module in 2013 .    in spite of the different shielding design of the two experiments , they use many of the same materials and employ similar detector technologies .",
    "since 2004 , gerda  and majorana  have taken advantage of this overlap by collaborating in an open way on topics of common interest . in particular",
    "they jointly develop and maintain a common and flexible monte carlo framework , mage  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of having a shared software project is that it avoids duplication of effort for software tools of common interest , thus easing debugging and validation efforts .",
    "following this experience , a new shared software project has been initiated by gerda  and majorana called majorana - gerda  data objects ( mgdo ) .",
    "the core function of this software is to provide a collection of c`++ `  objects to encapsulate hpge detector array event data and related analytical quantities .",
    "mgdo  thus provides a shared standard for the storage , access , and manipulation of gerda  and majorana  data .",
    "it also includes implementations of a number of general - purpose signal processing algorithms to support advanced detector signal analysis .",
    "mgdo  is designed as a set of class libraries exploiting the object - oriented paradigm .",
    "virtual base classes are provided which define abstract interfaces .",
    "such an approach makes the code flexible , easing future extensions and user customization .",
    "the source code is written in the c`++ `  programming language , allowing for the interfacing and extension of mgdo  with other general - purpose software for scientific computing .",
    "in particular , mgdo  adopts the system of units , physical constants , and several other tools provided by the clhep libraries  @xcite .",
    "mgdo  may also optionally be built against fftw3  @xcite for its fast digital fourier - transform routines , and may be built against root  @xcite for its advanced data storage and analysis tools .",
    "the tools provided in mgdo  can be divided in two main categories : data objects and transforms .",
    "the `` data objects '' are c`++ `  classes which encapsulate complex data and physical quantities , for example digitized waveforms , detector parameters , and channel cross - talk matrices .",
    "the aim of the data objects is to support data management and handling : the existence of an mgdo - defined standardized format eases the exchange and the cross - comparison of information , for example between monte carlo simulations and experimental data , or between different detector systems .",
    "root  wrappers for the data objects are also provided , which makes possibles the storage of mgdo  data objects in a root - based format .",
    "a concrete example of one of our key data objects , mgwaveform , is presented in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "the other main category of tools provided by mgdo  are `` transforms '' , general - purpose algorithms for digital signal processing .",
    "they encompass digital filters and other utilities , such as as smoothing , differentiation and extremum finders .",
    "fourier and wavelet transform routines are provided to enable analysis in the time domain , the frequency domain , or both .",
    "having many commonly - used algorithms available avoids code duplication in experiment - specific analysis software , and thus enhances testing , validation and performance optimization .",
    "root  wrappers for transforms are also provided to enable their use in interactive root  sessions .",
    "transforms are discussed in more detail in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "one of the key data objects provided by mgdo  is mgwaveform .",
    "it is designed to store and manipulate a digitized waveform produced by any kind of detector ( an hpge detector , a photo - multiplier , etc . ) . at its heart , mgwaveform is simply an array containing the individual samples of the waveform , plus a number of auxiliary attributes such as the sampling frequency , a time value to associate with the start of the trace , and the waveform type ( e.g.  voltage pulse , current pulse , etc . ) .",
    "the public interface of the class consists mostly of protected get and set methods for the attribute i / o , and of custom operators implementing widely - used waveform - waveform or waveform - scalar operations ( product , sum , etc . ) .",
    "the definition of custom operators facilitates the basic handling of waveform by internally managing the loop over the individual samples and by providing a consistent output .",
    "the `` rootified '' version of the class , mgtwaveform , has additional public methods which are inherited from the root  interface and provide direct connection to the root  i / o , graphical , and analytic utilities .",
    "for example , mgtwaveform provides functions to represent the waveform as a histogram object ( th1 ) that can be drawn or fit .",
    "it also provides methods to set a waveform from a function object ( tf1 ) , or to treat the waveform as a tf1 to be used itself as a fit function .",
    "an advantage of mgwaveform is that it can be used as a standard output format .",
    "experimental waveforms can be stored as mgwaveform objects , while the output of monte carlo simulations can be also directly produced as mgwaveforms .",
    "this allows the real and simulated waveforms to be treated on exactly the same footing by the analysis , easing inter - comparison , validation , adoption of simulated pulses into analysis routines , etc .",
    "furthermore , having a common format facilitates the exchange of information between gerda  and majorana , including data and monte carlo results of common interest .",
    "other data objects are available in mgdo , as for instance mgtevent .",
    "mgtevent is an mgdo  class designed to encapsulate the full information of events : it includes a set of waveforms ( one per channel ) and additional data attributes , such as a time stamp and daq flags .",
    "the mgdo  transforms are general - purpose algorithms for operations on mgwaveform data objects .",
    "the possible output of a transform is either a new mgwaveform ( e.g.  for filters or smoothers ) , or a set of scalar parameters ( e.g.  rise times or extrema ) , or both .",
    "each transform is implemented as a class inherited from the general virtual class mgvwaveformtransformer .",
    "the base class provides a general interface making it easy to add new user - specific transforms .",
    "implemented transforms that give a new waveform as output include ones which calculate and subtract a baseline , calculate the numeric derivative using simple ( three - point ) or more complex ( five - point or rc derivative ) algorithms , smooth the waveform using a moving average or triangular smoothing , and apply a trapezoidal filter @xcite .",
    "some of the scalar parameters calculated by transforms based on the input waveform(s ) include the @xmath3 difference of two waveforms , the global maximum or minimum of a waveform , and the rise time within given limits , e.g.  10% and 90% of the amplitude .",
    "a complex digital analysis of a real - life experiment can be implemented as a chain of mgdo  transforms , each performing a basic step of the processing .",
    "an example of chain , involving the smoothing and differentiation of a charge pulse , is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : transformchain ] .",
    "( -300,180)(0,0)[l]*(a ) * ( -300,115)(0,0)[l]*(b ) * ( -300,50)(0,0)[l]*(c ) *",
    "the tools available in the mgdo  library are used in the analysis software under development by majorana  and gerda .",
    "both the gerda  analysis framework gelatio  @xcite as well as the majorana  analysis toolkit `` gat '' rely on mgdo  for the i / o structure and for the basic digital filters used in signal processing .",
    "raw data produced in the gerda  and majorana  apparatuses as well as in detector test stands and simulations are transformed in mgdo  data objects and stored as root  files .",
    "this allows the treatment of all data with the same analysis framework , irrespective of the native daq binary format and of the type of detector .",
    "digitized traces from both hpge detectors and photo - multipliers ( e.g.  from veto detectors ) are treated identically and are stored in arrays of mgwaveforms inside mgtevent objects .",
    "furthermore , the gelatio and gat analysis modules implementing the waveform analysis are built as chains of mgdo  transforms , thus favoring the re - use of the code and avoiding unnecessary duplication .    although the specific applications by the majorana  and gerda  experiments drove the design and the development of the toolkit , the mgdo  libraries , and in particular mgwaveform and its transforms , are generic enough to be applicable beyond the context of germanium - based neutrinoless @xmath4 decay experiments .",
    "it could be of potential interest for other low - background experiments from the perspective of setting up a standard and portable format which is suitable for the sharing and the inter - exchange of data and information .",
    "we would like to express our gratitude to the majorana  and gerda  collaborations for the support given to this joint initiative .",
    "we thank in particular r.  henning for his continuous help and advice in the design and in the development of mgdo .",
