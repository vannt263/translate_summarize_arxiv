    "has been extensively investigated @xcite-@xcite .",
    "many practical quantum systems exist in the form of quantum ensembles .",
    "a quantum ensemble consists of a large number of ( e.g. , @xmath0 ) single quantum systems ( e.g. , identical spin systems or molecules ) .",
    "each single quantum system in a quantum ensemble is referred to as a member of the ensemble .",
    "quantum ensembles have wide applications in emerging quantum technology including quantum computation @xcite , long - distance quantum communication @xcite , and magnetic resonance imaging @xcite . in practical applications ,",
    "the members of a quantum ensemble could show variations in the parameters that characterize the system dynamics @xcite , @xcite .",
    "such an ensemble is called an inhomogeneous quantum ensemble @xcite .",
    "for example , the spins of an ensemble in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments may have a large dispersion in the strength of the applied radio frequency field ( rf imhomogeneity ) and their natural frequencies ( larmor dispersion ) @xcite .",
    "in complex systems , there are intrinsic inhomogeneities of even chemically identical molecules due to different conformations and diverse environments @xcite .",
    "the classification of inhomogeneous quantum ensembles is a significant issue and has great potential applications in the discrimination of atoms ( or molecules ) , the separation of isotopic molecules and quantum information extraction .",
    "however , quantum mechanics forbids deterministic discrimination among nonorthogonal states @xcite .",
    "a useful idea is to first drive the members of a quantum ensemble from an initial state to different orthogonal states corresponding to different classes ( e.g. , eigenstates ) before classifying them .",
    "usually , it is impractical to employ different control inputs for individual members of a quantum ensemble in physical experiments . hence , it is important to develop new approaches for designing external control fields that can simultaneously steer the ensemble of inhomogeneous systems from an initial state to different target states when variations exist in their internal parameters .",
    "some quantum control techniques such as the multidimensional pseudospectral method @xcite , @xcite , the lyapunov control methodology @xcite and the sampling - based learning control approach @xcite may provide inspiration for the solution to this problem .    in this paper",
    ", we recast the quantum ensemble classification task as a supervised quantum learning problem and present a systematic classification methodology by using a sampling - based learning control ( slc ) method @xcite , @xcite in quantum discrimination . in this method , we first learn an optimal control strategy to steer the members in a quantum ensemble belonging to different classes into their corresponding target states , and then employ a physical read - out process ( e.g. , projective measurement , fluorescence images of molecules @xcite , stern - gerlach experiment for spin systems @xcite , @xcite ) to classify these classes . for example , the states of single molecules could be read out using a visualization technique , where the highly photostable chromophore dinaphtoquaterrylenebis ( dicarboximide ) ( dnqdi ) is embedded in thin polymer films in concentrations sufficiently low to allow individual dnqdi molecules to be spatially resolved in an epifluorescence confocal microscope ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "it is feasible to read out the intensity of the single - molecule fluorescence after they are excited with laser pulses . for a spin ensemble ,",
    "when some members are driven to spin up and the other are driven to spin down , it is feasible to physically separate the two classes of members using stern - gerlach experiments @xcite .",
