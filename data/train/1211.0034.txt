    "topological insulators ( tis ) in both two and three spatial dimensions constitute an active topic of current condensed matter research.@xcite the non - trivial bulk band topology of three - dimensional ( 3d ) strong topological insulators causes the crossing of surface states at time - reversal invariant points in the surface brillouin zone and gives rise to a two - dimensional surface metal . in the vicinity of such crossing points ,",
    "the effective surface theory takes the form of a dirac equation of massless fermions , where spin and momentum are locked together .",
    "a fundamental property of this `` helical '' surface metal is a suppression of backscattering : electrons with opposite momenta have orthogonal spin projections , such that impurity scattering @xmath0 is impossible without a spin flip . as a result",
    ", the metallic state is protected from the influence of non - magnetic disorder , and weak localization is replaced by weak antilocalization.@xcite this scenario of forbidden backscattering has been tested in recent experiments@xcite utilizing powerful fourier - transform scanning tunneling spectroscopy@xcite ( ftsts ) . in this technique ,",
    "energy - dependent spatial variations of the local density of states ( ldos ) are analyzed in terms of quasiparticle interference ( qpi ) , i.e. , quasiparticle scattering processes due to impurities .",
    "the qpi results obtained on 3d tis such as bi@xmath1sb@xmath2 and bi@xmath3te@xmath4 were found to be consistent with a heuristic picture of electron scattering in a helical liquid , with backscattering being suppressed .",
    "these results prompt the question as to how scattering from _ magnetic _ impurities on the surface of tis is manifest in observables such as the qpi patterns obtained by ftsts .",
    "in fact , recent experiments@xcite on bi@xmath3te@xmath4 doped with dilute magnetic fe atoms purport to demonstrate from the qpi pattern signatures of time - reversal symmetry breaking .",
    "however , one must be careful to distinguish a fluctuating magnetic moment from one which is static on the large timescale of the sts experiment .",
    "the latter situation implies magnetic long - range order , whose existence requires a sufficient density of magnetic moments and low temperature .",
    "then , every impurity moment is polarized , and time - reversal symmetry is broken.@xcite interestingly , it has been shown theoretically that such static magnetic impurities do not lead to backscattering being visible in qpi ; within lowest - order born approximation , a static local field is entirely invisible in qpi.@xcite    in this paper , we focus instead on the case of fluctuating magnetic impurities , relevant to the dilute limit . the interaction between the impurity moment and the electrons of the surface metal leads to mutual spin flips ,",
    "such that backscattering could be allowed although time - reversal symmetry remains unbroken .",
    "it is such spin - flip processes which lead to kondo screening of the impurity moment in standard metals.@xcite therefore the key question , also relevant to the experiments of ref .",
    ", pertains to the signatures in qpi of the kondo interaction between the helical metal and the impurity . to answer this , we solve the problem of a single kondo impurity on the surface of a 3d ti numerically exactly , and calculate the induced qpi pattern which of course now includes inelastic scattering off the magnetic moment .",
    "our main findings are as follows .",
    "( i ) the magnetic impurity is described by a standard su(2)-symmetric impurity model , despite spin ",
    "momentum locking and hexagonal warping effects of the surface states of a real ti . as a result , the impurity moment is always kondo screened in the low - temperature limit , unless the chemical potential is tuned exactly to the dirac point .",
    "( ii ) while scattering off a kondo impurity does not open new scattering channels in momentum space as compared to a non - magnetic impurity , it leads to a distinct _ energy _ dependence of the qpi pattern , which moreover exhibits universal scaling in terms of both scanning energy and temperature .",
