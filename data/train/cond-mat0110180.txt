    "the effect of fast modes ( e.g.  short wavelength modes neglected in a galerkin approximation ) is often described by noise  @xcite . as a consequence ,",

    "now , we consider @xmath4 as a fixed parameter , but below we will be concerned with situations where @xmath4 varies slowly in time .",
    "of course , one may be interested in situations where noise enters in a different way , for instance @xmath5 depending on @xmath6 as well , or coloured noise .",
    "there exist different methods to characterize the dynamics of the langevin equation .",
    "a popular approach is to determine the probability density @xmath7 of @xmath8 , which gives all information on the instantaneous state of the system .",
    "for instance , the probability that @xmath8 belongs to a subset @xmath9 of phase space is given by the integral of @xmath7 over @xmath9 .",
    "the density is given by the normalized solution of the fokker ",
    "planck equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the diffusion matrix .",
    "in particular , in the isotropic case @xmath12 , admits the stationary solution @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the normalization . for small @xmath3 ,",
    "the stationary distribution is sharply peaked around the minima of the potential . for an arbitrary initial distribution , however , the fokker ",
    "planck equation can not be solved in general , and one has to rely on spectral methods , wkb approximations and the like .    even if we have obtained a solution of , this approach still has serious shortcomings .",
    "the reason is that the probability density only gives an instantaneous picture of the system . if , for instance , we want to compute correlation functions such as @xmath15 for @xmath16 , solving the fokker ",
    "planck equation with initial condition @xmath17 is not enough : we need to solve it for _ all _ initial conditions @xmath18 .",
    "quantities such as the supremum of @xmath19 over some time interval are even harder to handle .",
    "it is important to take into account that the stochastic differential equation does not only induce a probability distribution of @xmath8 , but also generates a measure on the paths , which contains much more information . for almost any realization @xmath20 of the brownian motion , and any deterministic initial condition @xmath17 ,",
    "the solution @xmath21 of is a continuous function of time ( though not differentiable ) .",
    "the random variable @xmath22 for fixed @xmath23 is only one of many interesting random quantities which can be associated with the stochastic process .",
    "first - exit times form an important class of such alternative random variables , and have been studied in detail .",
    "if @xmath9 is a ( measurable ) subset of phase space , the first - exit time of @xmath8 from @xmath9 is defined as @xmath24 for instance , if @xmath9 is a set of the form @xmath25 , containing a unique equilibrium point which is stable , then the distribution of @xmath26 is asymptotically exponential , with expectation behaving in the small - noise limit like kramers time @xmath27 a mathematical theory allowing to estimate first - exit times for general @xmath28-dimensional systems ( with a drift term not necessarily deriving from a potential ) has been developed by freidlin and wentzell  @xcite . in specific situations ,",
    "more precise results are available , for instance the following . if @xmath9 contains a unique , stable equilibrium point , subexponential corrections to the asymptotic expression   are known , even for possibly time - dependent drift terms  @xcite .",
    "the case where @xmath9 contains a saddle as unique equilibrium point has been considered by kifer in the seminal paper  @xcite .",
    "the situation where @xmath9 contains a stable equilibrium in its interior and a saddle on its boundary is dealt with in  @xcite , employing the method of matched asymptotic expansions .",
    "the limiting behaviour of the distribution of the first - exit time from a neighbourhood of a unique stable equilibrium point as well as from a neighbourhood of a saddle point has been obtained by day  @xcite .",
    "we remark that more recently , another approach has been introduced , which mimics concepts from the theory of dissipative dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "the main idea is that for a given realization of the noise ( i.e. , in a quenched picture ) , paths with different initial conditions may converge to an attractor , which has similar properties as deterministic attractors .",
    "of course , in experiments , this random attractor is only visible if we manage to repeat the experiment many times with the same realization of noise .",
    "the method of choice to study the langevin equation also depends on the time scale we are interested in .",
    "consider for instance a one - dimensional double - well potential @xmath29 , @xmath30 , with a barrier of height @xmath31 .",
    "assume that @xmath17 is concentrated at the bottom @xmath32 of the right - hand potential well .",
    "if the noise is sufficiently weak , paths are likely to stay in the right - hand well for a long time .",
    "the distribution of @xmath8 will first approach a gaussian in a time of order @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the curvature at the bottom of the well ( the variance of the gaussian is approximately @xmath35 ) . with overwhelming probability",
    ", paths will remain inside the same potential well , for all times significantly shorter than kramers time @xmath36 . only on longer time scales will the density of @xmath8 approach the bimodal stationary density .",
    "the dynamics will thus be very different on the time scales @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "random attractors can be reached only in the last regime . in particular , results in @xcite stating that for the double - well potential @xmath1 , the random attractor almost surely consists of one ( random ) point apply to the regime @xmath40 .    in the present work ,",
    "we are interested in situations where the parameter @xmath4 varies slowly in time , that is , we consider stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) of the form @xmath41 such situations occur if the system under consideration is slowly forced , for instance by an external magnetic field , by climatic changes , or by a varying energy supply .",
    "note that the probability density of @xmath8 still obeys a fokker ",
    "planck equation , but there will be no stationary solution in general .",
    "the main idea of our approach to equations of the form is the following . for sufficiently small @xmath42 and @xmath3 , and on an appropriate time scale ,",
    "we show that the paths @xmath43 can be divided into two classes .",
    "the first class consists of those paths which remain in certain space ",
    "time sets , typically in the of potential wells ( but in some cases , they may switch potential wells ) .",
    "the geometry and size of these sets depends on noise intensity and shape of potential .",
    "the second class consists of the remaining paths , which we do not try to describe in detail , but whose overall probability is small , typically exponentially small in some combination of @xmath42 and @xmath3 . in this way , we obtain in particular concentration results on the density of @xmath8 without solving the fokker  planck equation , but we also obtain global information on the stochastic process , including correlations , first - exit times , transition probabilities and , for instance , the shape of hysteresis cycles .    the slow time dependence of @xmath4 introduces a new time scale . if , for instance , @xmath4 is periodic with period @xmath44 , then depends periodically on time with period @xmath45 . since the shape of the potential changes in time , the definitions and of the kramers and relaxation times no longer make sense .",
    "we can , however , define these time scales by @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 denote , respectively , the maximal values of barrier height and curvature of a potential well over one period .",
    "our results typically apply to the regime @xmath49 that is , we require that @xmath50 and @xmath51 . the minimal curvature and barrier height , however , are allowed to become small , or even to vanish .",
    "we can describe the paths behaviour on time intervals including many periods of the forcing , as long as they are significantly shorter than the maximal kramers time .",
    "we find it convenient to measure time in units of the forcing period .",
    "after scaling @xmath23 by a factor @xmath42 , the relevant time scales become @xmath52 when scaling the brownian motion , we should keep in mind its diffusive nature , which implies that in the new units , its standard deviation grows like @xmath53 .",
    "equation   thus becomes @xmath54 in the deterministic case @xmath55 , we will sometimes write this equation in the form @xmath56 , which is customary in singular perturbation theory . throughout the paper , we will assume that @xmath1 , @xmath5 and @xmath4 are smooth functions , that @xmath57 grows at least like @xmath58 for large @xmath59 , and that the matrix elements of @xmath5 , as well as @xmath4 , have uniformly bounded absolute values .",
    "a large part of the paper is devoted to one - dimensional systems , and we come back to the multidimensional case in section  [ sec_g ] .    the aim of this paper is to illustrate our methods by applying them to a number of physically interesting examples .",
    "we thus emphasize the conceptual aspects , and refrain from giving mathematical details of the proofs , which will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we start , in section  [ sec_sw ] , by explaining the basic ideas in the simplest situation , where most paths remain concentrated near the bottom of a potential well .",
    "we also briefly describe the dynamics near a saddle .",
    "the three subsequent sections are devoted to more interesting cases in which paths may jump between the wells of a double - well potential . note that we restrict our attention to double - well potentials only to keep the presentation simple , but the dynamics in more complicated multi - well potentials can be described by the same approach .    in section  [ sec_sr ]",
    ", we discuss the phenomenon of stochastic resonance , where noise allows transitions between potential wells which would be impossible in the deterministic case .",
    "we compute the threshold noise intensity needed for transitions to be likely , and show that most paths are close , in a natural geometrical sense , to a periodic function .",
    "this provides an alternative quantitative measure of the signal s periodicity to the commonly used signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "section  [ sec_hy ] is devoted to hysteresis , which is also characteristic for forced bistable systems . for sufficiently strong forcing ,",
    "one of the two potential wells disappears , causing trajectories to switch between potential wells even when no noise is present ( ) . as a result , even in the adiabatic limit , the instantaneous value of the parameter @xmath4 does not suffice to determine the state of the system : solutions follow hysteresis cycles . in absence of noise , their area is known to scale in a nontrivial way with the frequency of the forcing .",
    "our methods allow us to characterize the distribution of the random hysteresis area for positive noise intensity .",
    "in particular , we show that for noise intensities above an amplitude - depending threshold , the typical area no longer depends , to leading order , on amplitude or frequency of the forcing .    in section  [ sec_bd ]",
    ", we consider the effect of additive noise on systems with spontaneous symmetry breaking , i.e. , when the potential transforms from single to double well . in the deterministic case ,",
    "solutions are known to track the saddle for a considerable time before falling into one of the potential wells , a phenomenon known as bifurcation delay .",
    "we characterize the effect of additive noise on this delay , and on the probability to choose one or the other potential well after the bifurcation .",
    "furthermore , we give results on the concentration of paths near potential wells which allow , in particular , to determine the optimal relation between speed of parameter drift and noise intensity for an experimental determination of the bifurcation diagram .    finally , section  [ sec_g ] contains some generalizations .",
    "we first discuss analogous results to those of section  [ sec_sw ] for multidimensional potentials .",
    "this formalism allows us to treat the effect of the simplest kind of coloured noise , given by an ornstein  uhlenbeck process , in a natural way .",
    "we conclude by discussing the dependence of previously discussed phenomena on noise colour .",
    "we are grateful to anton bovier for helpful comments on a preliminary version of the manuscript .",
    "thanks the wias for kind hospitality .",
    "we start by discussing situations in which the noise intensity is sufficiently small , compared to the depth of a given potential well , for paths to remain concentrated near the bottom of the well during a long time interval . in section  [ ssec_swl ] , the solvable linear case is used to compare the information provided by the fokker ",
    "planck equation and by the pathwise approach . in section  [ ssec_swn ] , we show that our method naturally extends to the nonlinear case .",
    "we briefly describe the dynamics near a saddle in section  [ ssec_es ] .",
    "it is instructive to consider first the case of a linear force ( that is , of a quadratic potential ) , which can be solved completely .",
    "a general one - dimensional , time - dependent quadratic potential can be written as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the location of the potential minimum , and @xmath62 is the curvature of the potential .",
    "the sde   takes the form @xmath63 where @xmath64 . throughout this paper",
    ", we will use @xmath65 to denote the linearization of the force at an equilibrium point @xmath66 , with @xmath67 if the equilibrium is stable , and @xmath68 if it is unstable . in this subsection and the following one , we consider the stable case , and assume that @xmath69 for all @xmath23 under consideration , where @xmath70 is a positive constant . for simplicity",

    "@xmath92 since @xmath71 is negative , @xmath91 tracks the bottom @xmath61 of the potential well with a small lag : @xmath93 if @xmath61 moves to the right , and @xmath94 if @xmath61 moves to the left .",

    "the spreading of @xmath8 is proportional to the noise intensity and inversely proportional to the square root of the curvature of the potential : flatter potentials give rise to a larger spreading of the distribution .    up to now",

    "the typical width @xmath264  is our measure of the deviation from the deterministic periodic function , which tracks one potential well in the small - noise case , and switches back and forth between the wells in the large - noise case .",
    "theorem  [ thm_srp ] implies in particular that for the periodic signal s amplification to be optimal , the noise intensity @xmath3 should exceed the threshold @xmath267 .",
    "larger noise intensities will increase both spreading of paths ( especially just before they cross the potential barrier ) and size of transition window , and thus spoil the output s periodicity .",

    "the situation is the same as if there were an effective potential barrier  of height proportional to @xmath278 .",
    "another remarkable fact is that for @xmath255 , neither the transition probability nor the width of the transition windows depend on the driving amplitude to leading order . in the remainder of this subsection",
    ", we are going to explain some ideas of the proof of theorem  [ thm_srp ] , which will hopefully clarify some of the above surprising properties .",
    "the first step is to understand the behaviour of the solutions of in the deterministic case @xmath55 .",
    "this problem belongs to the field of dynamical bifurcations , the theory of which is relatively well developed .",
    "we follow here a framework allowing to determine scaling laws of solutions near bifurcation points , which has been presented in @xcite .",
    "the main idea is that when approaching a bifurcation point @xmath279 , the distance between the adiabatic solution and the static equilibrium branch scales like @xmath280 for @xmath281 , and like @xmath282 for @xmath283 .",
    "the rational numbers @xmath284 , @xmath285 and @xmath286 are universal exponents , which can be deduced from the newton polygon of the bifurcation point .",

    "it is thus sufficient to understand what happens in a small of the almost - bifurcation .",
    "note that if @xmath287 , the right - hand well and the saddle merge at @xmath288 .",
    "it is thus helpful to consider the translated variable @xmath289 , which obeys the differential equation @xmath290 consider the worst  case @xmath291 .",
    "then the right - hand side of describes a transcritical bifurcation between the equilibria @xmath292 .",
    "one shows that the solution @xmath293 tracks @xmath294 at a distance scaling like @xmath295 for @xmath296 , and like @xmath297 for @xmath298 .",
    "in fact , @xmath293 never approaches the saddle closer than a distance of order @xmath297 , which is because the term @xmath299 only dominates during a short time interval of order @xmath297 .",
    "the same qualitative behaviour holds for @xmath300 .",
    "for @xmath272 , one can show that @xmath79 tracks @xmath246 at a distance never exceeding @xmath301 . since @xmath302 is of order @xmath234",
    ", @xmath79 never approaches the saddle closer than a distance of order @xmath234 .",
    "let us now consider the random motion near @xmath303 for @xmath304 .",
    "we denote , as usual , by @xmath140 the curvature of the potential at the deterministic solution @xmath79 . by , @xmath140 behaves , near @xmath231 , like @xmath305 , which we know to behave like @xmath306 for @xmath272 , and like @xmath307 for @xmath275 .",
    "it turns out that theorem  [ thm_swn ] can be extended to the present situation , to show that paths are concentrated in a strip around @xmath79 .",
    "the width of this strip is again related to the standard deviation of a linearized process , and behaves like @xmath308 however , this property only holds under the condition that the spreading is always smaller than the distance between @xmath79 and the saddle , which scales like @xmath309 .",
    "we thus have to require @xmath310 , so that    if @xmath251 , the condition is always satisfied , and thus follows from the generalization of theorem  [ thm_swn ] with @xmath311 ( a ) ;    if @xmath255 , the condition is only satisfied for @xmath258 ( b ) .",
    "it thus remains to understand what happens for @xmath312 if @xmath255 . here the main idea is that during the time interval @xmath257 $ ] , the process @xmath8 has a certain number of trials to reach the saddle . if @xmath8 reaches the saddle , it has roughly probability @xmath313 to move in each direction .",
    "if it moves far enough towards the left , it will most probably fall into the left - hand potential well , and is unlikely to come back for the remaining half - period .",
    "if it moves to the right , it has failed to overcome the barrier , but can try again during the next excursion .",
    "one can define a typical time @xmath314 for an excursion as the time needed for a path starting near @xmath233 to reach and overcome the barrier with non - negligible probability , say with probability @xmath315 .",
    "one can show , by comparison with suitable linearized processes , that this typical time is determined by the condition @xmath316 to obtain this , one first checks that the curvature of the potential is the same , up to sign reversal , at the adiabatic solutions tracking the bottom of the well and the saddle . to overcome the saddle , the integral in",
    "must be of order @xmath42 , similarly as in theorem  [ thm_es ] .",
    "the factor @xmath317 is needed to reach a distance of order @xmath44 from the saddle .",
    "now the maximal number @xmath14 of trials during the interval @xmath257 $ ] is given by @xmath318 finally , the markov property implies that the probability _ not _ to overcome the saddle during @xmath14 trials is bounded by @xmath319 which proves . an important point to note",
    "is that the transition probability is not determined by the curvature of the potential at the saddle , but by the curvature at the deterministic solution tracking the saddle , which may be larger for small @xmath70 .",
    "another case of interest is the ginzburg ",
    "landau potential with @xmath320 and @xmath321 , @xmath322 .",
    "then @xmath110 is always symmetric , with minima at @xmath323 and a barrier height @xmath324 becoming small at integer times .",
    "the associated sde is @xmath325 as before , transitions between potential wells are most likely when the barrier is lowest .",
    "we can thus define a transition probability as in , with @xmath326 .",

    "the main difference with respect to the previous case is that due to the symmetry , @xmath241 can never exceed @xmath313 .",
    "the limiting process obtained by letting @xmath3 go to zero but keeping @xmath255 is no longer a deterministic function , but a bernoulli  process , choosing between the left and the right potential well with probability @xmath313 at integer times ( ) .",
    "another difference lies in the distribution of barrier crossing times in the transition window . in the asymmetric case",
    ", paths may overcome the saddle as soon as @xmath312 , and are unlikely to return to the shallower well . in the symmetric case , paths may jump back and forth between both wells up to time @xmath336 , before settling for a potential well .",
    "other mechanisms leading to stochastic resonance have been examined , for instance periodic forcing which is not deterministic , but affects the noise intensity , a situation arising in power amplifiers @xcite .",
    "this case can be analyzed by the same method as the previous ones , but the results are quite different .",
    "let us consider the motion in a static symmetric double - well potential , described by the sde @xmath337 where @xmath338 is fixed and @xmath72 is periodic .",
    "we assume that @xmath339 for all @xmath23 .",
    "theorem  [ thm_swn ] shows that for sufficiently weak noise , paths starting at time @xmath242 at the bottom @xmath340 of the right - hand potential well remain concentrated in a strip around @xmath340 , with width proportional to @xmath341 .",
    "this holds as long as the spreading is smaller than a constant times the distance @xmath340 between well and saddle .",
    "the probability to cross the saddle before time @xmath23 is bounded by @xmath342 and @xmath266 .",
    "thus if @xmath115 reaches its maximum @xmath343 at time @xmath106 , the probability to see a transition during one period satisfies @xmath344 note that here , as the potential is static , the threshold value for the noise intensity can be guessed from kramers time , assuming constant @xmath115 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath115 is _ not _ necessarily constant , we see that for @xmath255 , transitions are likely to happen in the time interval during which @xmath345 . for instance , if @xmath72 behaves quadratically near its unique maximum , this transition window is given by @xmath346 in contrast to the previous cases , however , the transition times are less concentrated , in the sense that for times @xmath347 before the transition window , @xmath348 a similar argument as in the previous cases shows that for @xmath255 , @xmath349 where @xmath350 is the length of the transition window .",
    "if the potential is made asymmetric , so that a constant term @xmath351 is added to the drift term in , the critical noise intensities needed to reach the saddle from the shallower left - hand well and the deeper right - hand well will be different ( one can check that their ratio is @xmath352 ) . as a consequence , transitions from the shallower to the deeper well will be likely as soon as the noise intensity exceeds the smaller threshold , while transitions in both directions are likely when the noise intensity exceeds the larger threshold .",
    "when the noise intensity drops below the smaller threshold again , @xmath8 will be in the deeper right - hand well with larger probability .",
    "the net effect is that @xmath8 will visit both wells near integer times , but has only small probability to remain in the shallow well after the transition window .",
    "thus the periodic signal is not amplified in the same way as discussed before , but nevertheless we observe an amplification mechanism which allows to read off at which times the threshold is exceeded .",
    "hysteresis is another characteristic phenomenon of bistable systems .",
