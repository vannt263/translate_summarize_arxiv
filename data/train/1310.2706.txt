    "einstein s general theory of relativity ( gtr ) @xcite is based on a pure tensor theory of gravity where gravitational constant is taken as a time - independent quantity .",
    "but brans - dicke ( bd ) theory @xcite is a scalar - tensor theory of gravity where the gravitational constant is a time - dependent quantity .",
    "bd theory is the simplest extension over gtr through the introduction of a time - dependent scalar field @xmath0 as @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 , where the scalar field @xmath0 couples to gravity with a coupling parameter @xmath4 known as the bd parameter .",
    "interestingly bd theory can be transformed to gtr in the limit @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "solar system observations require @xmath7 @xcite . also bd type model can be regarded as the lowest limit of kaluza - klein and string theories @xcite .",
    "again bd theory explains many cosmological phenomena such as inflation @xcite , early and late time behaviour of the universe @xcite , cosmic acceleration and structure formation @xcite , coincidence problem @xcite and problems relating to black holes @xcite .",
    "primordial black holes ( pbhs ) are those black holes which are formed in the early universe through variety of mechanisms such as inflation @xcite , initial inhomogeneities @xcite , phase transition and critical phenomena in gravitational collapse @xcite , bubble collision @xcite or the decay of cosmic loops @xcite . a comparision of cosmological density of the universe with the density associated with a black hole , at any time after bigbang , shows that formation mass of pbh would have same order as that of horizon mass .",
    "thus pbh could span wide mass range starting from planck mass @xmath8 to more than @xmath9 . from hawking s point of view",
    "black holes emit thermal radiation quantum mechanically @xcite .",
    "so black holes will evaporate depending upon their formation masses .",
    "smaller the mass of pbhs , quicker they evaporate . as density of a black hole varies inversely with its mass , high density which is possible in the early universe ,",
    "is required to form lighter black holes .",
    "so pbhs are the only black holes whose masses could be so small that they became able to evaporate completely by the present epoch through hawking evaporation @xcite . early evaporating pbhs",
    "could account for baryogenesis @xcite , in the universe . on the other hand , longer lived pbhs could act as seeds for structure formation @xcite and could also form a significant component of the dark matter @xcite . again in refs @xcite , it is concluded that pbhs could take comparatively more time to evaporate due to accretion of radiation which makes them long lived .",
    "accordingly the standard picture of cosmology , the universe is radiation - dominated in the very beginning of its evolution and now it is matter - dominated .",
    "this gives the decelerated expansion of universe through its evolution .",
    "but the observations of distant measurements to type ia supernovae ( snia ) @xcite indicate that the expansion of universe is accelerating in the present epoch and that two - third of the critical energy density exists in a dark energy component with a large negative pressure and of unknown composition .",
    "the simplest possibility of dark energy is vacuum energy .",
    "recent data shows that dark energy occupies @xmath10 of universe and @xmath11 is occupied by some other matter .",
    "snia observations also provide the evidence of a decelerated universe in the recent past with transition from decelerated to accelerated occuring at redshift @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "so the vacuum energy should be started from @xmath13 i.e. @xmath14 .",
    "the equation of state parameter @xmath15 is the most acceptable candidate for dark energy .    in this work ,",
    "we examine the evolution of pbhs only in vacuum - dominated era using bd theory . in our study , we consider vacuum energy accretion by pbhs and its effect on their evaporation .",
    "we also present a comparision between our results and the corresponding results of standard cosmology @xcite .",
    "for a spatially flat @xmath17 friedmann - robertson - walker universe with scale factor @xmath18 the first friedmann equation using brans - dicke theory in vacuum dominated era is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the vacuum energy density    the energy conservation equation is given by    @xmath21    @xmath22 is the equation of state parameter and for vacuum energy @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the hubble parameter .",
    "so equation ( 2 ) gives vacuum energy density @xmath25 is a constant .    from our previous paper @xcite",
    ", we have obtained the time dependent gravitational constant for vacuum dominated era by matching the time dimension of each term of friedmann equation ( 1 ) as    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the present value of the gravitational constant and @xmath28 is the present age of the universe .",
    "using equation ( 3 ) , the above friedmann equation can be expressed as    @xmath29    the solution of this equation gives    @xmath30    where equations ( 3 ) and",
    "( 4 ) give the expressions for @xmath31 and scale factor @xmath16 .",
    "pbh mass can be changed by accumulating vacuum energy .",
    "the mass of pbh increases due to accretion with a rate given by    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the black hole radius , @xmath34 and @xmath35 denotes the vacuum energy accretion efficiency . now using the above expressions of @xmath36 and @xmath37 with equation ( 3 )",
    ", we can write equation ( 6 ) as    @xmath38    on integration the above equation gives    @xmath39}^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 is an initial mass of pbh formed at time @xmath41 i.e @xmath42^{-1}t_i$ ] .    now the equation ( 8) becomes @xmath43}^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now using the numerical values of different quantities like @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , we obtain    @xmath48^{-1}\\ ] ]    this equation gives the mass of pbh due to accretion only .",
    "we can also write equation ( 10 ) as @xmath49}^{-1}\\ ] ]    for validity of above equation @xmath50    for large time t , @xmath51 and we get @xmath52 the variation of pbh mass with time due to accretion only is shown in figure-1 .",
    "the figure-1 shows that at a particular time the mass of pbh increases with increase in accretion efficiency and for a particular accretion efficiency mass saturates after a particular time .",
    "due to hawking radiation @xcite , the rate of decrease of pbh mass is given by    @xmath53    where @xmath54 denotes the black body constant , @xmath55 is the hawking temperature .    using the solution of @xmath1 with the above expressions of @xmath36 and @xmath56 in vacuum dominated era we can write the rate of decrease of pbh mass as    @xmath57    we ,",
    "now , study the evolution of pbh by considering both accretion and evaporation in vacuum dominated era .    in this case , the rate of change of pbh mass is given by    @xmath58    this equation can not be solved analytically .",
    "so we use numerical method to solve it .",
    "the evaporation of pbh for different accretion efficiencies is shown in figure-2 .     for different accretion efficiencies ]",
    "the figure - 2 shows that with increase in accretion efficiency life - time of pbh increases .",
    "comparision of the above results with those of standard cosmology [ 1 ] shows many interesting differences . in standard cosmology vacuum energy accretion",
    "is only possible upto a critical time @xmath59 which depends on accretion efficiency and formation time and beyond which accretion stops while in brans - dicke theory vacuum energy accretion is possible for all values of time ( t ) eventhough the accreting mass saturates beyond certain time depending on accretion efficiency .",
    "we also observe that in bd theory the accretion of vacuum energy by pbh occurs at a smaller rate leading to quicker evaporation compared with standard cosmology @xcite .",
    "further , the evaporation time in bd theory is found to depend upon vacuum energy accretion efficiency whereas in standard cosmology it is independent of the accretion efficiency .",
    "the evaporation time of pbh formed at @xmath60 for both brans - dicke ( bd ) theory and standard cosmology ( sc ) are shown in the table-1 .",
    "@xmath61 & @xmath62 & @xmath63 + 0 & @xmath64 & @xmath65 + 0.2 & @xmath66 & @xmath67 + 0.4 & @xmath68 & @xmath67 + 0.6 & @xmath69 & @xmath67 +",
    "here we study the evolution of primordial black hole ( pbh ) in vacuum - dominated era within brans - dicke cosmology .",
    "first we obtain the expression for scale factor @xmath16 and the gravitational constant @xmath1 in vacuum - dominated era .",
    "then we study the accretion of vacuum energy by pbhs .",
    "first we notice that the accretion efficiency has an upperbound of @xmath70 .",
    "we , then , find that pbh mass increases with accretion efficiency leading to longer life as the accretion efficiency takes higher values .",
