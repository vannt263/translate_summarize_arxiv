    "the evidence for a @xmath1 symmetry of the superconducting pairing in the high - t@xmath3 cuprate superconductors ( htcs ) is nowadays overwhelming@xcite .",
    "nonetheless it is well known that a secondary gap component of different symmetry can develop either spontaneously or driven by external factors , like a magnetic field , magnetic impurities as well as the proximity to an interface @xcite .",
    "the first important consequence is that the nodal lines of the gap located along the diagonals of the brillouin zone ( @xmath4 direction ) can be removed , deeply altering the low energy properties .",
    "secondly , this kind of superconducting state can break the time - reversal symmetry with important consequences on the physical properties@xcite . specifically",
    "a superconducting state with mixed @xmath5 symmetry has been invoked in refs .",
    "@xcite to explain the thermal conductivity anomalies in @xmath6 ( bi2212 ) @xcite , in ref .",
    "@xcite to account for the properties of single quasiparticle states observed in the vortex core @xcite , and in ref .",
    "@xcite as a possible explanation of the momentum and temperature dependence of the damping of quasiparticles .",
    "scanning tunnelling experiments in @xmath7 ( ybco ) @xcite and in @xmath8 ( lsco ) @xcite have also shown clear deviations from the pure @xmath1-wave symmetry . while the lsco results have been originally interpreted in terms of a @xmath9 wave , a recent reanalysis based on the results of the present report",
    "has shown that the @xmath5 symmetry is a more faithful description of the experiments@xcite .",
    "our main motivation comes indeed from tunnelling experiment on ybco films @xcite , which have evidenced that the zero - bias conductance peak associated with a pure @xmath1 gap function@xcite undergoes a _",
    "doping- _ and _ magnetic - field - dependent _ splitting .",
    "this can be interpreted @xcite in terms of a secondary time - reversal breaking component of the superconducting gap .",
    "it is quite important to notice that the amplitude of the splitting has a power - law dependence on doping and magnetic - field .",
    "the ( zero - field ) splitting is in fact linear in the deviation from the optimal doping for overdoped samples , and it is zero for underdoped samples .",
    "moreover , starting from a finite ( zero ) value at zero field , the splitting increases linearly in the overdoped ( underdoped ) materials with the magnetic field , while it displays a square - root dependence close to optimal doping .",
    "these power - law dependencies are strong indications of a critical behavior due to a second - order phase transition and are hardly accounted for by surface or disorder effects alone .",
    "the above result suggests therefore a doping - driven _ bulk _ transition .",
    "the observed fraction of @xmath10 pairing increases with @xmath11 , but it must be noticed that it never exceeds the @xmath12 of the principal one in all the measured samples@xcite .",
    "these experimental situation leaves the door open for at least two scenarios . in the first one , discussed in a different context in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath10 component keeps increasing by further doping and eventually the gap becomes of pure @xmath10 symmetry . in the alternative scenario , which is supported by our analysis ,",
    "the @xmath10 fraction does not monotonically increase , but it starts to decrease at some doping , leading to a smaller dome beneath the @xmath1 , where the mixed order parameter is stable .",
    "our scenario is also consistent with other experiments which put severe upper bounds for any imaginary component of the gap ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent discussion ) .    the experimental framework described above suggested us to carry out a systematic analysis of the specific properties which may favor the occurrence of a mixed superconducting state in some cuprates and not in others . to achieve this goal",
    ", we quantitatively analyze the role of band - structure effects ( van hove singularity ( vhs ) , bilayer splitting , and orthorhombic distortion ) , and of the form of the pairing interaction in determining the weight of the secondary component ( if any ) , the features of the phase diagram and the behavior of observables like the specific heat .",
    "we rely on the simple bcs approach to make the role of the above ingredients more transparent .",
    "we notice that the fact that the @xmath5 order parameter , when observed @xcite , establishes in the overdoped regime , where strong correlation effects are less important .    in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the formalism and discuss in different subsections the effects of the fermi surface ( a ) , the bilayer splitting ( b ) , the orthorhombic distortion ( c ) and of a qcp ( d ) . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss how a phase diagram for the secondary component can be drawn , and sec .",
    "iv is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "general theoretical constraints for the appearance of a bulk mixed order parameter have already been studied , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite . in particular , in the first of these works it has been shown that the mixed state is more likely to establish close to a surface than in the bulk and that the @xmath0 wave is the most favored secondary component in both cases .",
    "here we recall some basic symmetry arguments and derive the bcs equations .",
    "the strong anisotropy of the htcs allows us to focus on a purely two - dimensional lattice system , characterized by the @xmath13 point group .",
    "only the four harmonics corresponding to the one - dimensional irreducible representations of the group are compatible with singlet pairing .",
    "we can write them as@xcite @xmath14 then , the gap function can be written as @xmath15 where the index @xmath16 labels the different representations and @xmath17 , with integer @xmath18 , denotes a lattice site ( we take the lattice spacing @xmath19 ) . the primed sum is restricted to inequivalent sites under the symmetry of the lattice ( i.e. , to the different lattice distances ) . if we require the invariance of @xmath20 under the point group transformations , the gap function has to transform either like a single representation , or like a complex ( time - reversal breaking ) combination of the form @xmath21 with @xmath22 .    expanding the bcs equation in the same harmonics , it is easy to realize that the appearance of a harmonic labeled by @xmath23 is controlled by the correspondent component of the pair potential @xmath24 . in a generic model for the cuprates",
    "the on - site interaction ( @xmath25 ) is repulsive ( positive ) due to strong local repulsion .",
    "the longer distance part ( @xmath26 ) is instead attractive ( negative ) and it is reasonably assumed to be a decreasing function of distance .",
    "we can therefore restrict to the smallest distance harmonics . in the following we always use the symbol @xmath27 to denote the modulus of the @xmath28 . for @xmath29 , the only nonzero harmonic belongs to the @xmath30 representation , and corresponds to the isotropic @xmath31-wave , which is ruled out by the repulsive @xmath25 .",
    "for @xmath32 the @xmath30 and @xmath33 representations are associated with the extended @xmath34 and @xmath1 waves , respectively . for @xmath35 ,",
    "the non - vanishing harmonics are related to the @xmath36 and @xmath10 waves ( @xmath30 and @xmath37 representations ) .",
    "if we take a complex combination of the form @xmath38 , with both @xmath39 and @xmath40 real , each gap parameter affects the other only through the quasiparticle spectrum and the secondary pairing can be viewed as a bcs coupling between the bogoljubov quasiparticles of the primary superconducting phase .",
    "the bcs equations then read @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the inverse temperature , @xmath43^{1/2}$ ] , with @xmath44 , @xmath45 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the band dispersion is @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are nearest and next - nearest neighbor hoppings and @xmath49 is the chemical potential .",
    "density functional theory gives a typical value for the hopping @xmath47 in the htcs of @xmath50 m@xmath51 , while @xmath52 assumes different values in the various compounds@xcite .",
    "these values can however be reduced by a factor of two by correlation effects , that can be estimated by fitting the angular resolved photoemission spectra with a tight - binding model . as we will see later in more detail ,",
    "the value of @xmath52 has important effect on the dos , since it controls the position of the van hove singularity ( vhs ) .    being the largest attractive coupling @xmath53 controls the principal component of the gap , which can be @xmath1 or @xmath54 . for typical values of the particle density in the htcs , both low doping and the vhs of the two - dimensional dos",
    "strongly favor the @xmath1 symmetry , which thus represents the principal component of the superconducting gap even in the simplified bcs approach @xcite .",
    "we take henceforth @xmath55 in eqs .",
    "( [ bcs1]),([bcs2 ] ) .",
    "the spectrum for the secondary @xmath56 component is therefore ( pseudo)gapped by the principal @xmath57 gap @xmath39 . as a consequence",
    ", the mixed order parameter establishes only for @xmath58 larger than a critical value @xmath59 , as opposed to the case of the cooper instability in the metallic phase , which takes place for arbitrarily small coupling .",
    "the critical coupling for both @xmath10 and @xmath36 secondary pairing is determined by solving the bcs equations ( [ bcs1]),([bcs2 ] ) with @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively .",
    "the only difference between these two cases is the different form of the harmonic @xmath62 that weights the same kernel in @xmath63 .",
    "this kernel , in turn , is affected by the presence of the @xmath57 wave .",
    "the @xmath57 gap in the @xmath64 spectrum strongly suppresses the contributions from the @xmath65 points @xmath66 , while it does not affect much the nodal lines .",
    "the @xmath10 wave has nodes along the @xmath67 directions and is maximum along the diagonals , while the @xmath36 has its maximum contributions from the @xmath65 points , just like the @xmath57 .",
    "it is therefore clear that the @xmath10 is most likely candidate for the secondary component @xcite .",
    "a numerical solution of the above eqs . ( [ bcs1]),([bcs2 ] ) confirms the above arguments , finding @xmath59 always larger for @xmath36 than for @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , the appearance of the @xmath36 component is generally associated to a first - order transition from pure @xmath57 to pure @xmath36 , since the continuous mixing is unlikely due to the strong competition between the two harmonics .",
    "this kind of scenario is clearly incompatible with the experiments , in which the secondary component appears in a continuous way .",
    "the continuous transition from @xmath1 to @xmath5 gap is therefore the most natural candidate if a pure @xmath1 is to be modified by a small secondary component , as suggested by the experiments on ybco@xcite and on lsco @xcite .",
    "next , we evaluate the critical value of @xmath58 to get @xmath10 pairing , @xmath68 , assuming a given value of @xmath53 .",
    "a similar analysis has been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite for a continuous model , and in ref.@xcite for a lattice model . in the latter case , in which the effect of a two - dimensional dos is considered",
    ", it is always found that @xmath69 .",
    "this would imply that a secondary component is possible only taking a potential which increases with the distance , at least going from nearest to next - nearest neighbors .",
    "this condition seems hard to be realized in a microscopic model , where the interaction is naturally a decreasing function of distance .",
    "similar results have been obtained also within a @xmath47-@xmath70-@xmath71 model in @xcite , where the @xmath72 and pure @xmath10 establish , respectively , for @xmath73 and @xmath74 , which are clearly not representative of the cuprates . in the case of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath75 may be smaller than one for some values of the parameters , but this only comes from the assumption of a flat dos , which is clearly not representative of the htcs .    having in mind that for a plausible microscopic potential @xmath76 , in the following we explore the conditions for the appearance of the secondary harmonic obeying this constraint .",
    "first we notice that the larger is the value of @xmath53 is , the smaller is the ratio @xmath75 . in other words , if both the couplings are large , a secondary component may appear also for @xmath76 .",
    "the above claim can be understood as follows : if we increase @xmath53 , @xmath39 also increases , and it has different effects on the two equations .",
    "the integral @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ bcs2 ] ) does not change much by increasing @xmath39 , due to the @xmath77 factor , while @xmath78 instead contains @xmath79 , and it is therefore substantially reduced by @xmath39 . since , from eqs .",
    "( [ bcs1]),([bcs2 ] ) , @xmath80 , this implies that , at fixed band dispersion , the larger is @xmath53 , the smaller is the ratio @xmath75 and then the mixed state is more favored .",
    "the argument above shows that strong coupling is necessary for the appearance of a secondary component@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath53 can not be increased indefinitely without pushing the value of @xmath39 to unphysical values .",
    "if we want to increase the @xmath57-coupling at fixed @xmath39 we can introduce a cut - off @xmath81 in the integrals .",
    "this cut - off is not just an artifact to push the system to stronger coupling , but naturally measures the typical energy scale of the attractive potential . in the forthcoming calculations we take @xmath82 m@xmath51",
    "as we see in the following , this choice of cut - off leads us to reasonable phase diagrams without assuming unphysical values of the gap .",
    "now we discuss the role of different physical effects on the value of the critical @xmath58 .",
    "some preliminary considerations may be done before numerically solving the bcs equations . in a bcs approach",
    ", the bandstructure influences the values of the gap and of the critical temperature only through the dos .",
    "in particular , the vhs plays the main role , strongly favoring the pure @xmath57 pairing .",
    "other harmonics may be stabilized only for doping values for which the chemical potential is sufficiently far from the vhs .",
    "this means that , if we want the @xmath10 to appear for dopings , like the ones of the experiments , the vhs must be relatively close to half - filling .",
    "this is realized for cuprates with closed fermi surface like lsco .",
    "to explain the appearance of the secondary component in ybco we therefore have to invoke some other effects , like orthorhombic distortion or bilayer splitting .",
    "both this effects are expected to help the secondary component to appear , because they `` regularize '' the vhs .",
    "we discuss the role of these effects in the following subsections .",
    "the final subsection is instead dedicated to the form of the pairing potential @xmath84 , and in particular to the possible role of a qcp in the charge sector close to optimal doping@xcite .       as a function of the doping @xmath11 for @xmath85 , @xmath86 and different values of the ratio @xmath87 .",
    "when the curve crosses the line @xmath88 the appearance of the secondary harmonics becomes possible with @xmath76.,width=340 ]    as we mentioned above , the position of the vhs plays an important role in determining the symmetry of the order parameter within the bcs approach .",
    "the ratio @xmath89 is a direct measure of the position of the vhs , and consequently of the shape of the fermi surface . for @xmath90 ,",
    "the vhs lies at the chemical potential at half - filling .",
    "increasing @xmath89 , the density for which the chemical potential lies at the vhs moves away from half - filling .",
    "consequently , the stability of the pure @xmath57 wave extends to larger doping , making the appearance of the @xmath10 more difficult .",
    "we numerically solve eqs .",
    "( [ bcs1 ] ) and ( [ bcs2 ] ) to make the analysis more quantitative .",
    "the results are reported in fig . 1 . here",
    "we take @xmath53 constant as a function of doping , just to avoid the complications of many varying parameters and to disentangle the effect of the vhs .",
    "it is understood that @xmath53 will depend on doping in a realistic description of the cuprates .    according to the discussion above ( @xmath76 )",
    ", the secondary harmonics can only appear , roughly speaking , when @xmath91 .",
    "the appearance of the secondary harmonic is more likely as the doping increases , but the minimal doping @xmath92 above which @xmath91 increases with @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath92 assumes values compatible with the experimental findings only for ( small ) values of @xmath87 such that the fermi surface is closed , while an open fermi surface pushes @xmath92 to exceedingly large values .",
    "this analysis suggests that the @xmath5 pairing may likely occur in lsco , where the fermi surface is expected to be closed , at least in the optimal and overdoped region .",
    "other physical effects must be invoked for open fermi surface materials like ybco or bi2212 .",
    "materials like ybco and bi2212 have relatively large values @xmath93 , and therefore open fermi surfaces , which favor , according to the previous analysis , a pure @xmath57 pairing .",
    "however , the strict two - dimensionality assumed up to now overestimates the effect of the vhs , which strongly favors the @xmath1 wave .",
    "ybco and bi2212 , as opposed to lsco , are indeed multi - layer cuprates . introducing the multi - layer structure of bi2212 and ybco results in a `` regularization '' of the vhs",
    "arpes measurements in bi2212 show indeed a bilayer splitting @xmath94 at the m points which , although smaller than the one predicted by band - structure calculations @xcite , is sizable , and varies from 88 m@xmath51 to 140 m@xmath51 @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of similar data on ybco ( where arpes measurements are much harder to perform ) , but the bare values of @xmath95 in bi2212 and ybco are similar , so that we can expect similar renormalized values .    to analyse the role of a bilayer structure we introduce a band splitting of the form @xmath96 which modifies the effective dos and splits the vhs partially spoiling the @xmath57 principal component .",
    "on the other hand , the nodal regions are not affected and so one expects the ratio @xmath97 to decrease as soon as @xmath98 . in fig.[nuovafig ] we show the doping dependence of @xmath97 for the same values of @xmath53 and of @xmath81 as in the case of fig.[tprimo ] .",
    "the two curves with open and solid squares corresponds to the case @xmath99 and @xmath100 respectively and are , as expected , lower than that for @xmath101 .",
    "as can be seen in the figure , the second of these curves , which still compatible with the measured value of @xmath102 is bi2212 , has been lowered enough to cross the @xmath103 line .    in conclusion",
    ", the bilayer splitting helps the @xmath10 component to establish at least in all those doping regions for which the chemical potential falls in the dip of the density of states centered at @xmath104 , leaving one of the two fermi surfaces open .",
    "this is a relevant scenario for the case of ybco and bi2212 in which the fermi surfaces is open .     as a function of the doping @xmath11 for @xmath85 , @xmath86 and different values of the splitting parameter @xmath95 and of the orthorhombic parameter @xmath105 .",
    "the upper curve is the same as that shown in fig.[tprimo].,width=340 ]      another important effect that lowers the impact of the vhs on the pairing in the cuprates is an orthorhombic splitting of the bands .",
    "this is accounted for by taking a dispersion of the form @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "in this way @xmath108 and the kernel containing @xmath109^{1/2}$ ] that enters the equations ( [ bcs1]),([bcs2 ] ) , are no longer symmetric functions with respect to the @xmath13 group . in any case",
    "this kernel can still be expanded in terms of the @xmath13-harmonics and one can solve the resulting coupled equations . however ,",
    "if the orthorhombic distortion is small , one can neglect the effects on the symmetry of the gap and take only the larger effects on the density of states . in doing this , one neglects the @xmath33-@xmath30 and @xmath37-@xmath110 mixing that arises because the @xmath13-group symmetry of the system has been lowered to @xmath111 .",
    "in fact , the basis functions for the two one - dimensional representations of @xmath111 that couples to the singlet are given by @xmath112 respectively , and what we do in the following is to project our solutions on the original @xmath57 and @xmath10 harmonics in order to understand the role of a small orthorhombic distortion on the @xmath113 solution .",
    "the density of states is then qualitatively similar to the bilayered one .",
    "in fact the vhs is split and one expects that when the chemical potential lies in the dip the secondary @xmath10 component is again favored with respect to the case with @xmath114 .",
    "the results are represented by the two curves with crosses and stars in fig.[nuovafig ] .",
    "we have used for @xmath115 the same value of @xmath50 m@xmath51 as before for @xmath47 and varied the ratio @xmath116 denoted as @xmath117 .",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath81 are still those of the fig.[tprimo ] . in the case of @xmath118 ( crosses )",
    "the ratio @xmath97 , although lower than for the isotropic one , is still greater than @xmath119 , as well as that for @xmath120 ( stars ) even if in this last one the characteristic upward curvature coming from the presence of the dip in the dos can be clearly seen . as for the bilayer case",
    "we have used a constant value for @xmath53 aiming at analysing the effects of band structure of the orthorhombic distorted compounds on the critical coupling , and we have evidenced that the @xmath10 secondary component is favored by this effect .",
    "the values of @xmath117 that we have used are representative of the case of the cuprates according to , e.g. , ref.@xcite where a value of @xmath121 is found by means of _ ab - initio _",
    "calculations for the case of lsco .",
    "we now discuss how the form of the pair potential can be important to obtain the @xmath72 order parameter .",
    "in particular , we discuss how this phenomenology can be related to the qcp scenarios for htcs@xcite . in this context",
    ", it has been suggested that the pairing may be mediated by quasi - critical fluctuations close to the qcp in the charge and/or spin sector(s ) located near optimal doping . in this framework",
    "the correlation function of the critical fluctuations determines the functional form of the pairing potential .",
    "a few different qcp have been proposed , ranging from magnetic and/or charge ordering , to time reversal breaking . in the last part of this section",
    "we briefly discuss the case of charge and spin ordering , while here we first discuss some general consequences of a qcp near optimal doping which are independent on the nature of the ordered phase .",
    "far from criticality ( i.e. , far from optimal doping ) the short - range components @xmath122 may decrease strongly with the distance . at criticality",
    "the correlation saturates below a non - universal length scale , and all the components of the potential below this scale become of the same order of magnitude . @xmath58",
    "then becomes of the order of @xmath53 , favoring the appearance of a secondary component of the gap .",
    "this establishes the connection between the @xmath123 transition and the underlying quantum criticality .",
    "one may notice that , close to the qcp , where various couplings are of the same order of magnitude , higher - order harmonics should in principle be considered within each irreducible representation .",
    "the main outcome of this extension would only be a more detailed description of the gap profile , without changing the symmetry of the order parameter . observed deviations from a pure @xmath57 gap",
    "can be explained in this context @xcite .",
    "we now consider the specific case of a pairing interaction mediated by the fluctuations around a charge ordering qcp , with an incommensurate ordering vector @xmath124 . the effective interaction between quasiparticles in the cooper channel",
    "can be written as @xmath125 where @xmath126 is a residual local repulsion , @xmath127 is the attraction strength , @xmath128 is a `` mass term '' measuring the distance from criticality , and @xmath129 contains the momentum dependence of the interaction .",
    "the sum over the eight momenta @xmath130 makes the interaction symmetric under the @xmath13 group .",
    "the real - space expression for ( [ potcr ] ) is particularly useful in light of the previous analysis .",
    "we can in fact write @xmath131 the local repulsion obviously enter only in the on - site coupling and does not therefore play any role in the @xmath123 transition .",
    "@xmath132 are dimensionless functions of @xmath128 and the lattice distances * r*. when the system is at the critical point , i.e. , in the limit @xmath133 , all the @xmath134 approach the same value regardless of the index * r * , as we expected from the general arguments given above .",
    "the dependence on the critical vector * q * is entirely contained in the symmetry factor @xmath135 , i.e. , in the above defined harmonics computed at the ordering vector * q*. the first two coupling constants that enter the bcs equations ( [ bcs1 ] ) and ( [ bcs2 ] ) are then given by @xmath136 and @xmath137 @xcite .",
    "the modulation of the couplings introduced by the critical momentum * q * determines regions in which some coupling may become repulsive , thus making the correspondent harmonic impossible to establish .",
    "in particular , the @xmath72 symmetry is possible only if both @xmath53 and @xmath58 are attractive , i.e. , for @xmath138 $ ] and @xmath139 $ ] .",
    "moreover , the ratio @xmath140 is proportional to the form factor @xmath141 , and it is therefore maximum at @xmath142 .",
    "the mixed symmetry order parameter is therefore more likely for small ordering vectors .",
    "the contribution to the pairing interaction coming from the spin sector can be written in the same way as ( [ potcr ] ) , with an opposite sign .",
    "this implies that pairing mechanisms based on antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations@xcite , with ordering vector @xmath143 strongly favor @xmath57 pairing , which is maximum for this vector , while the @xmath58 coupling is repulsive for the same vector .",
    "even taking into account small incommensurations around the antiferromagnetic vector , spin fluctuations mechanisms do not favor the appearance of the @xmath72 order parameter . because of the relevance of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in the underdoped region of the phase diagram of the cuprates this analysis indicates that the mixed @xmath72 state should not be present at least in the extremely underdoped compounds , in agreement with the experiments .    to summarize the main outcome of this section",
    ", the proximity to a qcp helps in meeting the necessary conditions for the mixed symmetry ( i.e. , strong coupling and @xmath140 close to 1 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the specific nature of the qcp ( like , e.g. , charge and/or spin ordering ) may introduce sign modulations of the real - space interaction , making some components repulsive , and therefore suppressing the correspondent harmonics . the pairing mechanism based on antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations @xcite strongly favors the @xmath57 pairing , but suppresses the @xmath10 channel , leading to pure @xmath57 .",
    "mechanisms based on charge fluctuations support instead a secondary @xmath10 component besides a primary @xmath57 provided the characteristic ordering wave vector @xmath144 is not too large ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "and @xmath113 pairing in the htcs .",
    "the parameters , which are appropriate for open fermi surface cuprates , are given in the text.,width=340 ]    we can now draw a phase diagram for the @xmath113 pairing by fixing @xmath53 for each doping @xmath11 , such that the mean field critical temperature for @xmath57 pairing ( which we interpret as the temperature for cooper pair formation without phase coherence in the underdoped regime ) grossly follows the behavior of the pseudogap temperature @xmath146 for small values of @xmath11 , and becomes negligibly small for the doping at which @xmath147 vanishes in the overdoped regime . in this way we phenomenologically introduce the doping dependence of the principal component of the interaction @xmath148 . in particular @xmath148 will be larger at low doping and decrease toward weak coupling in the overdoped regime . around optimal doping",
    "we obtain @xmath149 , which is larger than the value we used to draw the diagrams of figs . 1 and 2 , and , according to the previous discussion on the relevance of the strong coupling , is more favorable for the @xmath2 pairing .    on the other hand",
    ", we consider the less favorable situation in terms of bandstructure by using the single - layer isotropic dispersion ( @xmath150 and @xmath151 ) . according to the previous analysis , in order to have a chance to observe a @xmath10 component in this unfavorable situation",
    ", we need to assume a small value of @xmath152 which gives a closed fermi surface in the relevant doping range .",
    "the value of the interaction is obviously crucial .",
    "here we take , at any doping , @xmath153 , a relatively large value , which , as we have seen , can be reasonably reached if a qcp is located close to optimal doping .",
    "this constant value of @xmath140 allows us to analyse the combined role of the density of states and of the doping dependence of the principal coupling . in fig .",

    "[ phd ] , the mixed @xmath5 order parameter is stabilized in a small dome slightly shifted in the overdoped region , @xmath154 , and the @xmath10 gap is always only a small fraction of the @xmath57 gap .    the shape of the mixed state region is the consequence of the balance between two main effects : _",
    "i ) _ the @xmath10 can establish only when the vhs is far enough from the chemical potential , and therefore appears only above a given value of the doping . _",
    "ii ) _ further overdoping , @xmath148 decreases and pushes the system toward weak coupling , where the mixed order parameter ceases to be stable for reasonable values of @xmath140 .",
    "the dome shape is therefore an unavoidable consequence of taking a sensible value for the ratio @xmath155 . only by releasing this physical condition , and taking @xmath156 the @xmath10 component may indefinitely increase by overdoping , eventually leading to a pure @xmath10 pairing in the heavily overdoped region @xcite .",
    "the re - analysis of the lsco data@xcite with a @xmath157 gap parameter , clearly displays the closure of the dome in the overdoped region , in qualitative agreement with our analysis .",
    "we note that small variations of the ratio @xmath140 can significantly modify the amplitude of the secondary component . at doping @xmath158 , for example , by slightly enhancing @xmath140 from 0.8 to 0.9 ,",
    "the critical temperature for the @xmath113 state is enhanced by a factor of @xmath159 .    up to now",
    ", we have found that the @xmath160 transition can be found for values of the parameters appropriate to the single layer isotropic case with open fermi surface .",
    "the discussions of sec .",
    "ii b , c have shown that , as soon as small perturbations of the pure two - dimensional bandstructure are considered , the constraints for the onset of the secondary component are partially released .",
    "the data of fig .",
    "2 show in fact that for a realistic value of the bilayer splitting , the whole region @xmath161 becomes compatible with a @xmath157 order parameter .",
    "analogously , a small orthorhombic distortion lowers the values of the critical coupling .",
    "once realistic bandstructure parameters involving the above effects are used , the appearance of the time - reversal breaking order parameter in lsco and ybco , as well as the doping dependence , can be easily explained in the simple bcs approach .",
    "the physical mechanisms leading to the mixed order parameter here presented have however a general content which does not depend explicitly on the use of the bcs approach .",
    "it is important to stress that the dome behavior of the mixed order parameter does not depend on the details of the calculations , and represents a generic result within our approach .",
    "the experimental studies which motivated our work identified the transition to the mixed @xmath72 wave with the splitting on the zero bias conductance peak .",
    "here we finally discuss the possibility to provide a further experimental signature of the mixed order parameter by measuring the variation of the specific heat coefficient @xmath162 at @xmath123 transition . for the parameters used to draw the phase diagram of fig .",
    "3 , we have computed the mean - field jump of the specific heat at @xmath163 , where the secondary component is maximum , and the effect of the second transition should be more evident .",
    "we actually computed the entropy as a function of temperature , and extracted the specific heat from @xmath164 .    in this specific case , at the transition from the metal to the @xmath57 superconductor we obtain @xmath165 . at the @xmath72 transition ( which occurs approx . at @xmath166",
    "k in this case ) we obtain instead @xmath167 .",
    "we note that the absolute value of @xmath168 in the latter case is about two orders of magnitude smaller then in the former , higher temperature transition .",
    "even though fluctuation effects are expected to round the mean - field jump , our estimated value of @xmath168 suggests that the effect could be still experimentally detected .",
    "we have performed a systematic analysis of the possibility of a @xmath157 symmetry pairing in the cuprates by means of the simple bcs approach which is indeed justified by the experimental evidence that the mixed order parameter establishes in the overdoped region .",
    "our results are compatible with all the available indications of @xmath2 pairing in ybco and lsco . we have separately discussed the role of the bandstructure effects and of the pairing potential . since the vhs is an obstacle to the mixed pairing , all the effects that lower the impact of the singularity result in an enhanced tendency toward the @xmath157 pairing . in particular , the bilayer splitting characteristic of multilayer cuprates and the orthorhombic splitting of the bands both favor the mixed order parameter .",
    "the relevance of the bilayer splitting suggests that , bi2212 is also likely to show a mixed order parameter , with a small mixing of the same order of ybco .    as far as the pairing potential is concerned , we have shown that a mixed - symmetry superconducting state is more likely to establish at strong coupling . in particular , it can appear for @xmath155 only at strong coupling .",
    "the presence of a qcp around optimal doping is an important ingredient , since it enhances the coupling and makes the next - nearest neighbor component of the pairing potential ( responsible for the @xmath10 pairing ) of the same order of the nearest neighbor one ( responsible for @xmath57 ) .",
    "the main result of our analysis is that a mixed order parameter of the form @xmath157 can be stabilized in a small dome contained in the larger @xmath57 region with a pairing potential being a decreasing function of the distance , i.e. , @xmath76 .",
    "contrary to other scenarios , the @xmath10 component does not grow indefinitely with increasing doping and it is always smaller than the @xmath57 .",
    "the only way to obtain an indefinitely increasing @xmath10 component is to take an unphysically large ratio @xmath156 .",
    "we have also shown that @xmath157 pairing is more likely to occur for materials with closed fermi surfaces such as lsco , and in compounds where an inter - layer hopping splits the vhs .",
    "the less important role of the vhs in the electron - doped materials may lead to the @xmath157 state also in these family of compounds .",
    "we have also discussed the impact of the secondary transition on specific heat measurements , showing that the relative jump of the linear specific heat coefficient is a fraction of the jump at the primary ( higher temperature ) transition to the @xmath57 superconducting phase .",
