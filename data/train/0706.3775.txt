    "in two previous papers  @xcite , we introduced a formalism to compute multi - particle production in field theories coupled to strong time - dependent external sources .",
    "the qcd example of such a field theory is the color glass condensate ( cgc )  @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we considered a @xmath0 theory ; we believe however that most of our results are of general validity and can be extended to gauge theories  @xcite .    in this paper , we will address a problem in multi - particle production that was not considered in refs .",
    "specifically , the approach developed there did not include scattering processes that are important for the dynamics of the system at late times .",
    "these are the so called _ secular terms _ which are of higher order in the coupling constant ( loop corrections ) and are accompanied by growing powers of time  @xcite .",
    "the secular contributions must be resummed to obtain sensible results . in a quantum field theory ,",
    "this resummation is performed in principle by solving the dyson - schwinger equations . in practice ,",
    "the dyson - schwinger equations are difficult to solve . for a system of fields coupled to an ensemble of particles",
    ", it is well known that the dyson - schwinger equations can be approximated by a boltzmann equation for the distribution of particles .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to extend the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite to derive a kinetic equation that includes the late time contributions to multi - particle production in field theories with strong external sources .",
    "we have in mind the dynamics after a heavy ion collision , where the classical field produced by the colliding nuclei expands rapidly into the vacuum along the beam direction .",
    "our approach may also be of relevance to descriptions of the decay of the inflaton field and thermalization in the preheating and reheating phases of the early universe  a nice review with relevant references can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in both cases , as the classical field evolves , the occupation number decreases and it is more appropriate to describe the higher momentum modes of the system in terms of particle degrees of freedom .",
    "the connections between the classical approximation in field theory and kinetic equations in the framework of nuclear collisions were previously discussed by mueller and son @xcite , and subsequently by jeon @xcite .",
    "they considered a system of fields in the presence of an ensemble of particles described by a distribution @xmath1 . performing a classical approximation in the path integral describing the evolution of this system and a gradient expansion in the obtained dyson - schwinger equations",
    ", these authors obtained a kinetic equation for @xmath1 .",
    "an obvious question arises : with what accuracy does this kinetic equation reproduce the boltzmann equation one would obtain without performing the classical approximation ? the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite find that the kinetic equation obtained from the classical path integral reproduces correctly the collision term in the boltzmann equation to leading power of @xmath1 and ( surprisingly ) the first subleading term in @xmath1 as well .",
    "we shall adopt a more _ ab initio _ approach here by considering a system that does not contain any particle degrees of freedom _ initially _ , but where the fields are coupled to a strong time - dependent external source @xmath2 .",
    "the external source is assumed to be a stochastic variable that belongs to an ensemble of charges specified by a distribution @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "this is the typical set up in the description of heavy ion collisions in the color glass condensate framework where @xmath3 $ ] represents the distribution of color charges . because of the expansion of the system , one may anticipate that the system can be described by field theory methods at early times and by kinetic theory and hydrodynamics at later times .",
    "the matter in this regime in heavy ion collisions has interesting properties ; two noteworthy possibilities are dynamically generated topological charge  @xcite and plasma instabilities possibly leading to turbulent color fields  @xcite .",
    "this matter has been called an glasma  @xcite and understanding its dynamical evolution holds the key to a deeper understanding of the strongly interacting quark gluon plasma ( sqgp ) that may be formed at later times  @xcite .",
    "the    we will address here general questions about the dynamical evolution of such matter in the simplest possible context of a scalar ( @xmath0 ) field theory  :    * _ what is the kinetic equation one obtains in field theories coupled to strong external sources ?",
    "_ knowing the answer to this question is important for one to handle correctly the transition region between a field theory description and kinetic theory .",
    "indeed , one expects from the work in refs .",
    "@xcite that there exists a window in time where both approaches correctly describe the dynamics  .",
    "this suggests that the kinetic equation in the overlap regime must know about the coupling of sources to fields at earlier times .",
    "how is this manifest , how important is this effect and how does it go away ? * _ what terms in the kinetic equation are important at different stages of the expansion ? _ the previous question hints that we will obtain a kinetic equation that has additional terms absent in the conventional boltzmann equation .",
    "we would like to understand how this generalized boltzmann equation converges to the usual one at late times .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : nbar ] , we shall remind the reader of relevant formulae in the derivation  @xcite of the average number @xmath4 of produced particles . in section",
    "[ sec : dyson ] , we shall write down the dyson - schwinger equations for the two - point functions in theories with time dependent strong sources .",
    "these provide the starting point for a derivation in section [ sec : boltz ] of the corresponding kinetic equation for the glasma .",
    "we observe that the coupling of the field to an external source leads to an inhomogeneous term in this kinetic equation . in section [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the properties of the different terms appearing in the kinetic equation . albeit the collision term in the kinetic equation looks identical to the collision term in the usual boltzmann equation , it contains novel contributions to the self energy that are of 0-loop and 1-loop order .",
    "we discuss the power counting for these different contributions and assess their relative contribution at different stages of the temporal evolution of the glasma .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary and outlook emphasizing unresolved issues .",
    "an appendix addresses how the averaging over the sources @xmath2 in our formalism can be re - expressed in terms of the usual ensemble average implicit in the derivation of kinetic equations .",
    "we consider the theory of a real scalar field @xmath5 with cubic self - interactions , coupled to an external time dependent source @xmath6 .",
    "the lagrangian of the model is @xmath7 in @xcite , we systematically calculated particle production from these sources . in the color glass condensate framework that this toy model mimics ,",
    "the colliding projectiles are represented by a statistical ensemble of currents @xmath2 .",
    "physical quantities are obtained by averaging over all possible realizations of the @xmath2 s . in this section",
    ", we shall discuss the calculation of the average number of produced particles in a given configuration of @xmath2 s .",
    "a general formula for the average number @xmath4 of produced particles is @xmath8 the number of particles produced with a certain momentum @xmath9 is defined as the expectation value of the `` out '' number operator in the initial state .",
    "this formula gives the number of particles at asymptotic times , after the particles have decoupled  .",
    "a simple reduction formula gives  @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the wave function remormalization factor .",
    "the expectation value in the right hand side of this equation has two important features  : ( i ) the vacuum state is the `` in '' vacuum state on both sides and , ( ii ) the two fields inside the correlator are not time - ordered .",

    "is shown in figure [ fig : tree ] .",
    "note also that @xmath37 vanishes if the external source @xmath6 is zero . ] . at tree level , because @xmath24 , the sum over the @xmath36 indices in the schwinger - keldysh formalism at all the internal vertices of the tree ( including the sources ) can be performed by using the identities @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the free retarded propagator . ] .",
    "when this sum is performed , all propagators in the tree diagram can be simply replaced by retarded propagators .",

    "an algorithm was sketched to compute @xmath4 at next - to - leading order ( one loop ) in terms of the retarded classical field and of retarded fluctuations propagating in the classical field background .    in practice",
    ", one has to truncate the loop expansion . as we will discuss in the next section , the correct way to perform practical calculations",
    "is within the framework of the dyson",
    " schwinger equations .",
    "the main problem with the loop expansion described in the previous section is that , in general , truncations in @xmath42 will lead to an incorrect large time limit of the number of produced particles .",
    "this can be traced to secular terms containing powers of the time that invalidate the perturbative series in the large time limit .",
    "this can be cured by appropriate resummation ; the well known way to do this is to solve dyson - schwinger equations  @xcite . in this section",
    ", we shall discuss the dyson - schwinger equations obeyed by the two - point functions @xmath43 of the schwinger - keldysh formalism .",
    "we will see that the presence of a disconnected contribution to these 2-point functions leads to interesting features in the corresponding dyson - schwinger equations .",
    "it is straightforward to write a dyson - schwinger equation for the connected part of the 2-point function , @xmath44 , that resums self - energy corrections  : @xmath45{\\bs g}^{\\rm c}(v , y)\\ ; , \\label{eq : dsc0}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is a 1-particle irreducible connected self - energy , _ evaluated in the presence of external sources_. we shall not write here explicitly the @xmath47 indices carried by the various objects .",
    "instead , we write the time integrations as integrals over the complete schwinger - keldysh contour @xmath48 .    it is convenient to extract from this self - energy a local piece , by writing @xmath49 except for the background field , which is a genuine local contribution to the self - energy , there is a certain arbitrariness in this separation because it depends on the momentum scale at which we resolve the system . a contribution to the self - energy that does not change significantly over space - time scales on the order of the compton wavelength @xmath50 can be treated as a mean field at that scale .",
    "therefore , the mean field term @xmath51 will contain the classical field , and possibly changes in the dispersion relation due to medium effects  .",

    "such an approach has been pursued numerically in @xcite , but has not been attempted yet in the context of heavy ion collisions in the cgc framework .",
    "the dyson - schwinger equations we wrote down in the previous section contain all the necessary physics but their solution is likely too difficult ; they therefore by themselves do not provide any practical insight into the dynamics of high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "one can simplify the problem a step further by transforming the dyson - schwinger equations for the 2-point functions into kinetic equations .",
    "however , as we shall discuss shortly , doing so requires that certain assumptions be satisfied .",
    "as is well known , the boltzmann kinetic equation describes the space  time evolution of particle phase space densities .",
    "therefore , to achieve a kinetic description , the formalism considered thus far should be extended to incorporate an ensemble of particles .",

    "the time - scale at which resummation becomes necessary is related to the transport mean free path in the system , namely , the time between two large angle scatterings undergone by a particle .",
    "this resummation makes the distribution @xmath67 time ",
    "dependent reflecting the changes induced by collisions on the particle phase space distribution . under certain approximations to be discussed later , this temporal evolution is governed by a boltzmann equation .",

    "however , this conclusion is incorrect because of the presence of external sources which drive the system out of equilibrium .",

    "the extension ( [ eq : sk - f ] ) of the propagators leads to dyson - schwinger equations that are formally identical to eqs .",

    "for instance , in the mv model @xmath81 $ ] is a gaussian , which implies that all the sources must be connected pairwise .",

    "is displayed in figure [ fig : tree_j ] .",
    "note that the `` loop order '' of a given diagram is a meaningful concept only for diagrams _ before _ they are averaged over @xmath2 . indeed , as one can see by comparing the figures [ fig : tree ] and [ fig : tree_j ] , the diagram before the @xmath2-average has 0 loops and is of order @xmath98 .",

    "replace the green s functions with the quasi - particle ansatz and drop the spectral function @xmath101 which appears as a factor in all the terms .    if the terms proportional to @xmath66 were absent from eq .",
    "( [ eq : cnc1 ] ) , the steps outlined above would result in the well - known boltzmann ",
    "vlasov equation , @xmath104 the extra term we have in the dyson  schwinger equations , proportional to @xmath66 , will modify the boltzmann ",
    "vlasov equation .",
    "two key features of this novel term will prove essential in our derivation .",
    "the first is that @xmath105 does not depend on whether the points @xmath32 and @xmath33 are on the upper or lower branch of the time contour .",
    "this is because the expectation value of the field , for equal values of the sources @xmath106 and @xmath107 , is the same on both branches of the contour .",
    "the second feature is that the non - connected part of the propagators drops out of the spectral function , for the same reason .",
    "hence , @xmath108 utilizing these two properties , we can perform the gradient expansion for this additional term in the same way as performed for the usual self - energy correction .",

    "therefore , our final expression for the kinetic equation is @xmath110 the novel `` source term '' @xmath109 in this equation is non - zero even if the particle distribution @xmath111 is zero .",
    "it is therefore responsible for @xmath73 not being a fixed point of the above equation ; the solution of this equation is non - zero at later times even if the initial condition had a vanishing particle distribution . in the next section",
    ", we will discuss further significant differences between this kinetic equation and the conventional boltzmann - vlasov equation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : boltz0 ] ) .",
    "in this section , we shall discuss the various terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : boltz ] ) with emphasis on the differences between these and those appearing in the conventional boltzmann kinetic equation .",
    "we first consider the vlasov term ( @xmath112 ) in the boltzmann equation .",
    "we note that in performing the average of the _ mean field _",
    "@xmath113 , over the external sources @xmath2 , the various correlation functions @xmath114 permitted by the distribution of sources @xmath3 $ ] are nearly translation invariant . the dependence of these correlators on the barycentric co ",
    "ordinate @xmath115 is very slow because it arises from the density profile of the colliding nuclei .",
    "therefore the 1-point function @xmath116 , averaged over @xmath2 , also has a very slow dependence on its argument @xmath117 ; its fourier transform with respect to @xmath117 has only modes with momenta on the order of the inverse nuclear radius .",
    "as discussed previously , this scale is very small relative to the typical momentum of the particles under consideration and it is therefore legitimate to approximate it as a vlasov term .    as is well known , the effect of this term in the boltzmann equation is to change the momentum of particles as they move between regions where the external field is different .",
    "indeed , @xmath118 is the force that acts on the particles at point @xmath117 and accelerates them towards regions of lower potential . the mean field",
    "@xmath96 includes not only the classical field directly produced by the external sources , but also possibly a contribution coming from the particles encoded in @xmath111 .",
    "such a modification may arise from a modification of the particle dispersion relation due to the collective action of the other particles .",
