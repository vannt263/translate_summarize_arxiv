    "in general , the cosmological constant @xmath1 is treated as a fixed parameter when one considers the thermodynamic properties of a black hole . but based on some basic theories , which state that physical constants are not fixed a priori and may arise as vacuum expectation values , the cosmological constant may be treated as a variable parameter .",
    "variation of the cosmological constant affects the thermodynamic behaviours of gravitational systems and extends the phase space of the system 1,2,3,4,5 .",
    "indeed , thermodynamic properties of black holes in anti de sitter ( ads ) space are improved in an extended phase space in which the cosmological constant and its conjugate variable are considered as thermodynamic pressure and volume , respectively .",
    "for instance , the study of thermodynamic properties of charged ads black holes shows that a first - order phase transition between large and small black holes occurs which is analogous to the van der waals liquid - gas phase transition @xcite .",
    "this analogy can be improved by extending the thermodynamic phase space in which the same physical quantities are compared with the liquid - gas system @xcite .",
    "for instance , in nonextended phase space we find that the coexistence line is in the @xmath2 plane while in the extended phase space , as in the liquid - gas system , the transition occurs in the @xmath3 plane .",
    "the analogy between a charged black hole and van der waals system has been generalized to the higher dimensional charged black holes , rotating black holes , charged rotating black holes and born - infeld black holes in ads space @xcite . also some relevant discussions in the extended phase space can be found in refs .",

    ", it is worth investigating the effects of dilaton on the the analogy of dilatonic charged black hole as a van der waals system . in an extended phase space",
    ", the mass of black holes does not determine the internal energy but it is related to the enthalpy , which includes a contribution from the energy formation of the system .",
    "the thermodynamic volume @xmath6 can then be deduced in terms of the variables of the black hole spacetime in question which is not necessarily a geometrical volume defined in the spacetime .",
    "this occurs for rotating black holes @xcite , taub - nut and taub - bolt spacetimes and especially for the extreme taub - nut black hole which has a thermodynamic volume with no geometrical candidate at all @xcite .",
    "similar to these cases , we find that the volume for the cases of dilatonic charged black holes depends on the coupling constant of dilaton and electromagnetic fields and it is different from the geometrical volume defined in the spacetime .",
