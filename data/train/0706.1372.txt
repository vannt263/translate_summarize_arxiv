    "with the increased availability of simultaneous radio and observations in the last decade , there is now a large amount of evidence available pointing towards a very close interaction between the accretion disk and the jet in black hole x - ray binaries and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "most convincingly , this disk - jet interaction has been shown for microquasars , i.e. , black hole binaries with strongly relativistic jets such as or . in these systems ,",
    "the correlated flaring in the x - rays , optical / infra - red , and radio seen at certain times is generally interpreted as the evidence for ( ballistic ) ejection events of synchrotron radiation - emitting electron bubbles ( * ? ? ?",

    ", the x - ray flare represents the ejection of the synchrotron radiation emitting bubble , which then adiabatically expands within the jet flow and cools down , resulting in the peak of the emission shifting downwards in frequency with time @xcite .",
    "simultaneous broadband observations of such events , which show minute - long delays between the different wave bands , are consistent with this picture @xcite .",
    "the model has also been confirmed by proper motion measurements in the radio , which reveal intrinsic jet speeds of @xmath1@xmath2 for grs  1915 + 105 @xcite .",
    "comparable behavior was also detected in , suggesting that similar ejections also occur in active galactic nuclei , on correspondingly longer timescales @xcite .    for black hole binaries with weakly relativistic jets",
    ", the evidence for jet - disk - interaction is less direct .",
    "this evidence includes the correlation between x - ray states and radio emission in black hole transients ( e.g. , in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the success of modeling the radio to x - ray broad band spectrum of black hole candidates with outflow - dominated models ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "furthermore , at least for , there is also evidence for the presence of an energetically significant , strong outflow @xcite .",
    "a relativistic jet with @xmath3 has been associated with radio flares in this system @xcite .",
    "apart from grs  1915 + 105 , however , none of these observations shows direct evidence for a causal connection between the x - rays and jet on time scales of minutes .",
    "prompted by this lack of quasi - simultaneous short - term radio  x - ray correlations , in 1998 we initiated a long term monitoring campaign of cyg  x-1 with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) and the ryle telescope .",
    "biweekly 310ksec long simultaneous observations started in 1999 .",
    "previous searches for flares in campaign data taken between 1999 and mid-2003 did not reveal evidence for coherent short term activity in both bands , although a significant correlation on time scales of weeks was found , especially above @xmath010kev @xcite . in this _",
    "letter _ , we report on the observation made on 2005 april 16 , in which the first clear quasi - simultaneous radio  x - ray flare was detected in cyg  x-1 .",
    "the remainder of this _ letter _ is structured as follows . in  [ sec : obs ] we describe the observations , followed by the analysis of the flare in  [ sec : flare ] .",
    "we discuss the physics of the flare in the context of emission models for the radio and x - ray emission in ",
    "[ sec : discuss ] .",
    "we use data from both instruments on - board the _ rxte _ , the low energy proportional counter array ( pca ; * ? ? ? * ) and the high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ; * ? ? ?",
    "the data analysis was performed using the standard _ rxte _ data analysis software , heasoft 6.1.2 .",
    "spectral fitting was performed with xspec 11.3.2aa @xcite .    a crucial part of the observation happened during the early phase of the _ rxte _ observation , shortly after the source rose above the earth s horizon . due to auroral emission in the far ultra - violet and soft x - rays and due to cosmic ray reprocessing in the hard x - rays ,",
    "the earth s atmosphere is not completely x - ray dark . the typical 2.520kev x - ray flux at the typical magnetic latitude of the _ rxte _ orbit is too low , however , to influence our measurements @xcite .",
    "we therefore use all data taken whilst the source was @xmath4@xmath5 above the earth s horizon and had a source offset of @xmath6@xmath7 .",
    "we use pca data from the standard1 mode , which gives the full 2.5128kev pca count rate with a time resolution of 0.125s and no energy information , and from the standard2f mode , a binned data mode with a 128 channel energy resolution and a time resolution of 16s .",
    "x - ray light curves were extracted with the intrinsic time resolution of each mode and then barycentered and rebinned .",
    "the ryle telescope data were taken at 15ghz with a time resolution of @xmath08s .",
    "the typical @xmath8 uncertainty of the radio measurements is 9mjy .",
    "the observations are interrupted every @xmath01600s for phase calibration observations of j2007 + 4029 .",
    "the amplitude calibration of the ryle data corresponds to the flux scale of @xcite and is performed using nearby observations of 3c48 and 3c286 .",
    "see @xcite for further information on the ryle telescope .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ fig : longterm ] , 2005 april marks the possible end of a longer x - ray flaring episode of cyg  x-1 that started in early 2004 @xcite . while clearly defined radio flares are not uncommon in cyg  x-1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , increased radio emission and radio flaring are generally seen when the source is in the intermediate state between the hard and the soft states , while the radio is weak once the x - ray source approaches the soft state ( * ? ? ? * and therein ) . at the time of our pointed observations ,",
    "the soft x - ray flux had just come down from a large flare . shortly after the observation , the 1d averaged 15ghz flux peaked , reaching a maximum of @xmath030mjy , close to the brightest radio flux of cyg  x-1 during 2004/2005 .",
    "figure  [ fig : lc ] shows the 15ghz radio flux and the _ rxte _ pca count rate lightcurve measured on 2005 april 16 .",
    "close to the start of the observation , a radio flare is readily apparent . the total duration of the flare is @xmath015minutes . during this interval",
    "the 15ghz flux increased by a factor of @xmath03 to a peak radio flux of 70mjy .",
    "this radio flux is among the highest seen during the ryle monitoring .",
    "previous radio flares , however , did not occur during pointed _ rxte _ observations @xcite , and the source monitoring provided by the _",
    "rxte_-asm is too coarse to pick up such short lived x - ray events .",
    "_ rxte _ started observing cyg  x-1 about 10 minutes before the peak radio flux .",
    "the x - ray lightcurve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] shows a similar shape to the radio one , although with more substructure .",
    "the earlier maximum of the x - ray flare did not allow _ rxte _ to catch the start of the x - ray flare , or determine whether the maximum x - ray flux seen is indeed the peak of the x - ray flare . a cross correlation ( ccf )",
    "analysis using the algorithm of @xcite reveals a @xmath9s time lag of the radio with respect to the x - rays , where the @xmath8 uncertainty was determined using a standard bootstrapping method with 1000 realizations .",
    "other approaches to calculate the ccf for non - uniformly sampled data @xcite give essentially the same result . with a maximum @xcite - ccf of 0.38 , this analysis formally confirms the general similarity of the x - ray and radio lightcurves ( fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] ) . since the substructure of the x - ray lightcurve , i.e. , the two smaller flares after the main flare , is clearly different from that in the radio flare and since the start of the x - ray flare is not covered by our observations , the peak ccf value is not higher . for the same reasons ,",
    "the formal uncertainty of the lag measurement is rather large .    to characterize the shape of the radio flare",
    ", we fit the radio data ( rebinned to a resolution of 8s ) with the sum of a linear flux trend and a gaussian representing the flare , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a reference time , taken as the center of the time interval analyzed ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the barycentric time of maximum flux occured at @xmath13 with an uncertainty of 15s ( uncertainties are at the @xmath8 level for one interesting parameter ) .",
    "the peak flux of the flare component is @xmath14mjy and the width of the component is @xmath15s .",
    "the flare is superimposed to a continuum with @xmath16mjy , decreasing linearly with @xmath17 .",
    "the high quality of the fit is indicated by its low reduced @xmath18 ( @xmath19 for 233 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the radio flare is therefore symmetric around its maximum .",
    "this symmetry is a marked difference compared to the asymmetric flare of 2004 february 20 @xcite .",
    "modeling the _ rxte_-pca light curve is complicated by the flare already being in progress when the measurements started .",
    "furthermore , contrary to the radio data , where the scatter in the lightcurve is mainly due to the measurement uncertainty , the x - ray data are dominated by strong low - frequency noise onto which the x - ray flare is superimposed .",
    "consequently , the empirical model of eq .",
    "( [ eq : flarefunc ] ) does not result in a good description of the x - ray data .    to study the spectral evolution of cyg  x-1 during the flare",
    ", we perform a spectral analysis of the 2.520kev pca standard2f data at 16s time resolution using a simple photoabsorbed powerlaw , which proves sufficient to describe the spectrum at this lower signal to noise level . for spectra taken during the flare , at pca count rates above @xmath20 , the mean power law index @xmath21 .",
    "the spectrum hardens outside of the flare to @xmath22 ( errors given are the standard deviation of the individual power law fits to the standard2f spectra ) , a value typical for the intermediate state of this source @xcite .",
    "that cyg  x-1 was in the intermediate state on the day of the flare can also be confirmed by modeling the 2.5150kev pca and hexte spectrum of an _ rxte _ observation performed 4h after the flare ( to avoid possible `` contamination '' by the flaring activity ) with the sum of a photoabsorbed ( @xmath23 , held fixed ) , exponentially cut - off broken power law model .",
    "this empirical model has been shown to give a good characterization of the spectral shape of cyg  x-1 @xcite .",
    "the spectral parameters are a lower photon index @xmath24 , breaking at @xmath25 into a power law with @xmath26 . at @xmath27",
    "the exponential cutoff starts with a folding energy of @xmath28 ( all uncertainties are at the 90% level ) . in addition ,",
    "a fe k@xmath29 line from neutral iron is present with an equivalent width of 135ev .",
    "the 310kev source flux is @xmath30 .",
    "the parameters of the continuum are again consistent with an intermediate state and fits well with the empirical picture that radio flaring in black hole candidates occurs most frequently in this state @xcite .    to allow the interpretation of the observed softening during the flare with the general behavior of cyg  x-1 , fig .",
    "[ fig : hardness_int ] shows the x - ray hardness intensity diagram for the pca top layer standard2f 16s spectra in the context of the pointed _ rxte _ observations of the monitoring campaign .",
    "for black hole transients this diagram is seen to have an approximate -shape ( * ? ? ? * and therein ) . as a persistent hard state source , cyg  x-1",
    "is typically found in the top right corner of the diagram . outside of the flare ,",
    "the source is situated at a hardness of @xmath00.55 with a typical 1128kev pca count rate of @xmath0@xmath31 . during the flare the source softens and brightens .",
    "it leaves the region of the diagram where cyg  x-1 is usually found during our monitoring campaign , by moving to higher count rates , for this hardness , than usually observed .    flaring behavior in cyg  x-1",
    "is usually observed whenever the source is close to the `` jet line '' in its hardness intensity diagram , while the radio flux gets quenched once the source moves away from the jet line to the left of the diagram @xcite .",
    "in spectral fits based on the ` eqpair`-model of @xcite , the radio fluxes of cyg  x-1 are at their maximum when the compactness ratio @xmath32 ( fig .",
    "16 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; the compactness ratio is a measure for the relative importance of the energy dumped into the comptonizing plasma and that dissipated in the accretion disk ) , corresponding to a soft power law index of @xmath33 . from our database of spectra of cyg  x-1",
    ", we find that these observations have a @xmath34 hardness ratio of 0.52 , indicated by the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : hardness_int ] . during the 2005 april 16 observation ,",
    "the source was therefore close to this line of maximum radio flux and approached it asymptotically during the flare .",
    "in this _ letter _ we have presented the first evidence for a direct relationship of the x - ray and radio emission in cyg  x-1 on timescales of minutes .",
    "the data show the radio to lag the x - rays by @xmath9s and the x - ray spectral shape to approach the x - ray hardness ratio where the source is typically found at its largest radio flux in our long term monitoring , hinting towards a general similarity of the physics of individual flare events and the overall radio  x - ray connection .",
    "although the x - ray data do not cover the start of the x - ray flare , explaining the rather large uncertainty of the lag determination , the morphological similarities between the x - ray and radio lightcurves also suggest that the same event is observed in both wavebands .",
    "similar events in microquasars show that lags with timescales of several 100s are typical for the coherent behavior of these systems , such as a lag of 310@xmath3520s between the soft x - rays and the ir @xcite and 800s between the x - rays and the radio @xcite in grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "the timescale observed in cyg  x-1 allows us to place an upper limit to the physical separation of the x - ray and radio emitting regions of the accretion / ejection flow .",
    "we assume that the emission coincides with the imaged jet and that the jet is perpendicular to the orbital plane of the hde  226868/cyg  x-1 system ( although this is not a priori certain ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which has an inclination of @xmath36 @xcite . taking light travel time effects into account , for jet speeds of @xmath37 , the lower limit implied by observations of the transient jet ejection discussed by @xcite , the measured delay implies a separation of @xmath38au between the location of x - ray and radio emission . if the jet is relativistic instead , with a speed of @xmath39 , the distance increases to @xmath40au . note that similar values for the length of the jet are obtained by considering that",
    "the @xmath010minute duration of the radio flare is roughly equal to the dynamical timescale of the jet . assuming a distance of 2.5kpc",
    ", these values imply to a maximum projected angular separation between the x - ray and radio emitting region of @xmath41mas .    what is the physics of the observed event ? in the model of @xcite for transient radio events , the inner edge of a thin accretion disk is posited to move rapidly towards the black hole .",
    "the temperature at the inner edge therefore increases , leading to a softening of the source in the _ rxte_-pca as more disk photons enter the instrument s band pass .",
    "this x - ray flare is then followed by the ejection of an electron bubble , which rapidly expands , producing the observed radio emission .",
    "at least qualitatively , this behavior and also the time scales deduced above seem to agree with our observations , although the model was originally invented for the large scale variability of black hole candidates and not for such short events as the one discussed here . note that while the main flare dominates the measured time lag and therefore the sizes estimated above , it is followed by two short spikes , which are both present in the radio and the x - ray lightcurves , but at different time delays .",
    "these spikes could indicate that more than one blob of material was ejected at different speeds but can not be separated once the blobs have expanded and their radiation peaks in the radio .",
    "such a behavior could be typical for flares in cyg  x-1 , since the large radio flare of cyg  x-1 from 2005 feb 20 also shows very little substructure @xcite .    the lack of further detections of radio  x - ray flares in over 1.5msec of simultaneous radio  x - ray data precludes a more detailed discussion of the properties of the ejected material from comparing the source behavior during different flares .",
    "the observation of the flare itself , however , stresses the importance of long - term multi - wavelength campaigns to detect such rare events which are necessary to further our insight into the physics of the emission from black holes .",
