    "several groups have carried out gravitational microlensing observations towards the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) in order to search for massive compact halo objects ( machos ) in the galactic halo . until now , 13 - 17 candidates have been found towards the lmc and the microlensing optical depth @xmath5 from the events is @xmath6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the estimated typical lens mass depends on the adopted galactic kinematic model ranging over @xmath7 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have learned that there are lens objects along the line of sight towards the lmc .",
    "however , the issues of where lens objects are and what they are , are still unclear .",
    "this is because a degeneracy occurs in ordinary microlensing events for which the amplification is described by ( @xcite ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the projected separation of the source and lens in units of the the einstein radius @xmath10 , which is given by    @xmath11    here @xmath12 is the lens mass , @xmath13 is the normalized lens distance and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the observer - lens and the observer - source star distances .",
    "@xmath15 is hereafter assumed to be @xmath16 kpc .",
    "the time variation of the parameter @xmath17 is @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the minimum impact parameter in units of @xmath10 , the time of maximum magnification , the event time - scale and the transverse velocity of the lens relative to the line of sight towards the source star , respectively . from a light curve",
    ", one can determine the value of @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath23 , where @xmath12 , @xmath24 and @xmath22 are degenerate in @xmath23 .",
    "this three - fold degeneracy is the essential difficulty in determining the nature of the lens objects .",
    "there are only marginally possible candidates , viz .",
    "old white dwarfs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , old brown dwarfs ( @xcite ) and primordial black holes ( @xcite ) .",
    "possibilities for non - halo lensing objects have also been discussed , for example , dark objects in a dark heavy component of the lmc itself ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there is also the possibility that the lenses are dark objects in the galactic thick disc .",
    "while the microlensing optical depth @xmath5 by known populations of stars in the galactic thin disc and thick disc is of order @xmath25 ( @xcite ) , a maximal heavy thick disc , which may be surrounded by an extended dark halo composed of particles , is also a possible galactic component as the reservoir of lenses ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such a thick disc can have @xmath26 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , so the summed optical depth including the contribution from the galactic thin disc ( @xmath27 ) and the lmc itself ( @xmath28 , @xcite ) can be close to the observed value .",
    "the three - fold degeneracy can be resolved in some kinds of exotic microlensing events , e.g. , the binary event ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the finite source transit event ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite pointed out that an extensive transit events search would make it possible to discriminate between the lenses in the galactic halo and in the lmc .",
    "the third example is an event with parallax effect , which is essentially detected through the difference of light curves due to the spatial shift of an observer or observers . in such events",
    "we could determine the `` reduced transverse velocity '' @xmath29 of the lens .",
    "examples of the parallax effects are the following .",
    "the annual parallax effect due to the earth s motion around the sun during an event leads an asymmetry in the light curve ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , such events are rare .",
    "this parallax effect generally requires @xmath30 days , while @xmath31 days for typical events .",
    "another effect is parallax by the positional difference of two well - separated observation sites . in this case",
    ", we could measure the relative difference of the peak amplifications and the time at the peak amplifications between both . by observing an event from both a solar - orbit satellite and the earth",
    ", we could utilize the parallax effect in almost every event , while it is difficult from two distant observatories on the earth ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the parallax could be measured by the positional shift of an observer due to the diurnal motion of the earth , which was first advanced by @xcite , and due to the orbital motion of an earth - orbit space telescope such as the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) ( @xcite ) in binary events . in ordinary microlensing events",
    "this effect is quite small , but it is more efficient around the peak of high magnification events .    for galactic bulge events , @xcite discussed the possibility of detecting the finite source size and parallax effects by using two distinct ground - based telescopes in order to break the degeneracy in eme s ( extreme microlensing events , @xmath32 ) . with an approximate estimate for eme observations towards the lmc",
    ", he concluded that it is not feasible .",
    "however , with a more careful estimate , @xcite showed that it is feasible to detect eagle ( extremely amplified gravitational lensing ) towards the lmc .",
    "eagle is similar to the so - called `` pixel lensing '' events ( @xcite ) but more simply defined as the events in which the source star is dimmer than observational limiting magnitude ( ex .",
    "@xmath33 ) , and not concerned whether the source star is resolved or not . some eagles would be eme s .",
    "eagle events could be efficiently detected with the `` image subtraction method '' or ",
    "difference image analysis ( dia ) ",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which has been recently developed and can perform more accurate photometry than dophot and pixel lensing method .",
    "so , we refer the term eagle in this paper .",
    "if lens objects are in the thin or thick disc ( disc events ) , @xmath10 projected onto the observer plane from the source star , @xmath34 is much smaller than that for halo events . in this case",
    "the light curve is more sensitive to the small displacement of the observer position .",
    "therefore the fraction of parallax - measurable eagle events out of all eagle events for disc events will be much larger than that for halo events .",
    "this fraction is useful to discriminate statistically whether the lens objects are mainly in the thick disc or not .    here",
    ", we estimate the rate of parallax - measurable eagle events towards the lmc . in  [ sec : eagle ] we summarize the basic equations of eagle events . in ",
    "[ sec : model ] eagle event rates are estimated . in  [ sec : parallax_hst ] and [ sec : parallax_ground ] we describe the measurement of parallax effect from space and ground telescopes , respectively . in ",
    "[ sec : fraction ] we calculate the fraction of parallax - measurable events . discussion and conclusion are given in ",
    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    "an eagle event is a microlensing event in which a source star is fainter than the observational limiting magnitude .",
    "a highly amplified faint source would be detected as a new star .",
    "@xcite showed that the eagle event rate is fairly high towards the lmc .",
    "however an eagle search has not been involved in the microlensing surveys based on a dophot - type psf fitting photometry , which only measure already detected stars .",
    "a new ccd photometry method called dia , in which an exposure frame is directly compared with a reference frame , enables much more accurate photometry at any place where any star is nt identified on the reference .",
    "this is more powerful for detecting eagle events than the dophot .",
    "many eagle events are expected to be found by dia .",
    "a dim invisible source star with @xmath35-band apparent magnitude @xmath35 must be amplified brighter than eagle detection threshold @xmath36 , which is slightly brighter than the observational limit @xmath37 .",
    "so , the threshold amplitude is written as @xmath38 a corresponding threshold impact parameter @xmath39 which is the largest impact parameter to be detected as an eagle event depends on @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "this can be approximately written as ( @xcite ) @xmath40",
    "here we give adopted models of the galaxy and source stars , and estimate the event rate . since only the relative event rate is discussed , common constant factors @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and the normalization of the luminosity function are not essential .    when we consider microlensing by lens objects in the maximal disc ( ` disc events ' ) , we adopt an exponential disc as the mass density distribution for the galactic thin and thick disc .",
    "since the line of sight to the lmc is almost tangential to the azimuthal direction in the galaxy , the mass density at the region efficient to microlensing is not strongly dependent on the galactocentric radius @xmath43 but only on the height from the disc plane @xmath44 , as long as the disc scale height is much smaller than @xmath45 kpc .",
    "so we assume the disc density distribution only depends on @xmath44 as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the local disc column density and @xmath48 is the scale height of the disc .",
    "for the thin and thick disc we set @xmath49 pc and @xmath50 pc respectively .",
    "a certain acceptable value is @xmath51 @xmath52pc@xmath53 ( cf .",
    "if we adopt this value , due to the maximal disc limit of @xmath54 @xmath52pc@xmath53 estimated from the rotation speed of the galaxy ( @xcite ) , @xmath55 @xmath52pc@xmath53 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the value of the local column density for each disc may be different ( cf . @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "so we take @xmath47 as a model parameter assuming that the combined mass of the thin and thick discs does not exceed the maximal disc limit .",
    "we change the fraction of each component within this limit , i.e. , @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xmath52pc@xmath53 .    for the disc events we assume the power - law mass function @xmath58 of lens objects defined by equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) in @xcite .",
    "the number density of lens objects with the mass between @xmath12 and @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 , where @xmath42 is the mass fraction of the lens objects to the total mass and is assumed to be constant .",
    "we take the upper limit of mass @xmath61 @xmath52 and treat the lower limit @xmath62 and the power - law index @xmath63 as model parameters as @xmath64 or @xmath65 and @xmath66 or @xmath67 ,",
    "i.e. , we assume both the ordinary ( salpeter imf ) and an extreme model for a darker population of stars as a constituent of the maximal disc .",
    "our main results do not depend on this index very much ( see  [ sec : fraction ] ) . for the luminosity function of the source stars in the lmc , @xmath68 , we follow equations ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) in @xcite with the imf index @xmath69 , which is consistent with the luminosity function of the lmc observed by using the hst ( @xcite ) .    for machos ( ` halo events ' ) ,",
    "we adopt the spherical ` standard ' halo model given by ( @xcite ) @xmath70 where @xmath71 @xmath72pc@xmath73 is the local mass density , @xmath43 is the galactocentric radius , @xmath74 kpc is the galactocentric distance of the sun , and @xmath75 kpc is the core radius .",
    "we adopt delta - function mass functions with @xmath76 and @xmath77 @xmath52 because the lens mass function is not well known .    for the observational parameters we assume @xmath78 , which is a typical value for current microlensing programs with a 1-m class telescope . the events with the source star having @xmath79 are normal microlensing events , while ones with @xmath80 are eagle events",
    "we consider two different values for the threshold magnitude ; @xmath36 = 19 and 20 .",
    "the event rates of normal microlensing events ( @xmath81 ) and eagles ( @xmath82 ) , which are proportional to @xmath10 and @xmath83 respectively , are given by @xmath84 @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the upper and lower limit of the luminosity function .",
    "note that the integration is performed @xmath88 for @xmath81 and @xmath89 for @xmath82 .",
    "we calculate the relative eagle event rate @xmath90 for disc events , with the finite source size effect included .",
    "the results for @xmath91 19 and 20 are @xmath92 and 1.83 , respectively , only weakly dependent on parameters of the disc structure @xmath93 and the mass function ( @xmath63 , @xmath62 ) .",
    "this ratio depends on the luminosity function of source stars . as a result , only in the most extreme case that @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 @xmath52 , this ratio is slightly decreased due to finite source size effects . in the case that @xmath97 and @xmath98",
    ", we found that this effect is not negligible only when @xmath99 .",
    "for halo events , the events affected by finite source size effects are only several percent out of all eagle events ( @xcite ) .",
    "so hereafter we neglect the finite source size effect .    for events in which the source star is @xmath100 ,",
    "the period in which the source is visible ( @xmath101 ) is less than 2 days .",
    "then the detection efficiency for such events should be very low .",
    "so we estimated @xmath102 in the case that the source star is @xmath103 , and found @xmath104 and 1.47 with @xmath94 and 20 , respectively .",
    "we checked this ratio in the conservative case of a gentler slope @xmath105 with @xmath97 and @xmath103 , and found it to be 1.15 .",
    "this is still sufficiently high .    in this paper",
    ", we assume that microlensing events ( normal and eagle ) would be detected by a 1-m class alert telescope and the real - time analyses with dia , and then follow - up observations would be performed by an earth - orbit space telescope or a large ground - based telescope .",
    "here we describe the parallax effect observed with an earth - orbit space telescope such as the hst . in the following analysis",
