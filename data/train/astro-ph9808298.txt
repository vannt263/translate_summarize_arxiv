    "the hipparcos satellite ( perryman 1989 ) has provided high quality parallaxes for @xmath12  stars . these data can be used to address a variety of different astrophysical problems .",
    "hipparcos parallaxes for about one hundred nearby dwarfs with metal abundances in the range @xmath5[fe / h]@xmath6   were available to us , before their release to general public , as result of the hipparcos fast proposal n.022 .",
    "these objects had been originally selected because they seemed the most suited for globular cluster distance and age derivations via main sequence fitting technique .",
    "they have already been used in a careful revision of the age of the oldest globular clusters , gratton et al .",
    "( 1997a ) , who obtained ages consistent with inflationary models for the universe , if the value of the hubble constant is in the range 50 - 75 km  s@xmath13  mpc@xmath13 .    besides accurate parallaxes , an appropriate determination of * magnitudes * , * colours * and * chemical composition * of the dwarf sample were crucial in the derivation of distances and ages of gcs via main sequence fitting ( gratton et al . , 1997a ) .",
    "the relation between colour and magnitude of main sequence stars near the turnoff is very steep : @xmath14 .",
    "thus when fitting the main sequence of gc s with sequences of local subdwarfs , an error of only 0.01 mag in the colours translates into an uncertainty of @xmath15 gyr in the derived cluster ages , @xmath16 50 k in the derived effective temperatures , and , in turn , of 0.04 - 0.05 dex in the derived abundances .",
    "moreover , a basic assumption of gratton et al s ( 1997a ) age derivation was that the nearby subdwarfs share the same chemical composition of main sequence stars in globular clusters .",
    "this assumption was verified by a homogenous spectroscopic analysis of both cluster and field stars .",
    "abundance determinations for giants in globular cluster were published by carretta & gratton ( 1997 ) ; cluster main sequence stars are too faint for a reliable analysis until more 8  m class telescopes become available . here",
    ", we present the parallel spectroscopic study for 66 of the 99 nearby dwarfs in our sample .    the main purposes of this study were :    * to provide a photometric data - base for the programme stars to be used both in the globular cluster distance and age derivation and in the abundance analysis .",
    "an accurate and homogeneous photometric data - base for these stars is needed for a number of reasons : first because the determination of reliable absolute magnitudes directly bears upon the availability of accurate apparent magnitudes ; second because @xmath1 , and possibly @xmath3 colours ( the very deep , high resolution , colour magnitude diagrams recently obtained for a number of gcs by hst , are in a photometric band similar to the i band ) are required to build up the subdwarf template sequences to compare with the globular clusters main sequences ; and third because colours ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath4 and possibly @xmath3 ) are necessary to derive the effective temperatures used in abundance analyses .",
    "the vast data available in the literature should be homogenized , compared and implemented with the photometric data collected from the hipparcos / tycho mission , and transformed to a common uniform photometric system . * to provide metal abundances for the programme stars .",
    "the analysis should be homogenous with the globular cluster one , to avoid spurious errors in the derived distances and ages ; accurate because one anticipates that only a few stars will finally be used in the main sequence fitting ( once metal - rich , binary , and too - distant stars are discarded ) ; and should use updated model atmospheres ( kurucz 1993 ) , in order to have consistent results for both the sun and the programme stars ( else systematic errors will be introduced in the globular cluster ages when turnoff magnitudes are compared to isochrones ) * to derive abundances not only for fe , but also for o and for the @xmath10elements ( mainly mg and si ; but also ca and ti ) , because derived ages are affected at a significant level by non - solar abundance ratios .",
    "many studies beginning with the pioneering study by wallerstein et al .",
    "( 1963 ) , through the early echelle surveys of cohen , pilachowski , and peterson ( see pilachowski , sneden & wallerstein , 1983 , and references therein ) to recent large - sample abundance determinations in individual clusters ( reviewed by e.g. kraft 1994 ; carretta , gratton & sneden , 1997 ) have shown that these elements are overabundant in globular cluster stars .",
    "available data indicate that a similar overabundance is shared by metal - poor field stars ( see e.g. wheeler , sneden & truran 1989 ) . however , it is important to verify that this is the case also for the subdwarfs used in the main sequence fitting procedure , since a few subdwarfs are known to have no excess of heavy elements ( king 1997 , carney et al .",
    "* to determine high precision ( @xmath17  km / s error ) radial velocities for the target stars .",
    "these velocities can be compared with values in the literature , thus providing useful information on possible unknown binaries present in our sample .",
    "binary contamination is one of the major concerns in the derivation of distances to globular clusters using the subdwarf main sequence fitting method . * to compare stellar gravities deduced from hipparcos parallaxes with those from ionization equilibrium computations .",
    "several authors have suggested that there may be an appreciable fe overionization in the atmosphere of late f - early k - dwarfs ( bikmaev et al . , 1990 ; magain & zhao , 1996 ; feltzing & gustafsson , 1998 ) .",
    "if this were true , fe abundances derived assuming lte would be largely in error .",
    "gratton et al .",
    "( 1997b ) have shown that it is difficult to reconcile a large fe overionization in cool dwarfs with the rather good ionization equilibrium found for lower gravity , warmer stars ( see e.g. the case of rr lyrae stars : clementini et al . 1995 ) .",
    "but now , thanks to hipparcos , we are able to derive accurate surface gravities directly from luminosities and masses ( the last ones using stellar evolution models ) for a large sample of metal - poor dwarfs ; we can then test whether a significant fe overionization actually exists in these stars by simply comparing the abundances provided by neutral and singly ionized lines . * finally , to use this large , homogenous data set to recalibrate photometric and low @xmath8  spectroscopic abundances , that may be used to obtain moderate accuracy ( errors @xmath18  dex ) abundances for thousands of metal - poor stars . in particular we have tied to our scale the metal abundances by schuster & nissen ( 1989 ) , carney et al .",

    "photometric data ( @xmath19 and strmgren @xmath4 , @xmath20  and @xmath21 ) for all the programme stars ( 99 objects ) have been collected from a careful selection of the literature data available in the simbad data - base .",
    "a few stars ( five objects ) were re - observed .",
    "the hipparcos catalog provides @xmath0 magnitudes and @xmath1 , @xmath3 colours ( in the johnson - cousins system ) for all our objects .",
    "all @xmath3 colours are from the literature , while @xmath0 and @xmath1 are either from the literature or measured from the hipparcos / tycho missions ( grossmann et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "in particular , 55 of our objects have @xmath0  magnitudes directly measured by hipparcos ( @xmath22 ) , and 24 stars have @xmath1 colours measured by tycho , @xmath23 .",
    "data from different sources and in different photometric systems were transformed to a uniform photometric system , using equations which are available in electronic form upon request to the first author .",
    "average magnitudes and colours for the programme stars were derived combining literature and hipparcos data according to an accurate standardization procedure that is briefly outlined below .",
    "final adopted magnitudes and colours for the programme stars are given in table 1 where @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 are in the johnson system , and the @xmath3 and @xmath4 colours are in cousins and strmgren photometric systems , respectively .",
    "uncertain values are marked by a colon .",
    "only the first 20 entries of the table are given in the paper ; data for the remaining stars are available in electronic form .",
    "mean @xmath0  magnitudes ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath1 colours , @xmath25 , were computed as the average of the independent literature data .",
    "these mainly consist of johnson @xmath26 photometry by sandage & kowal ( 1986 ) , carney ( 1978 , 1983a , 1983b ) , carney & latham ( 1987 ) , laird , carney & latham ( 1988 ) , and carney et al .",
    "according to the distribution of individual measures around the average , measures that were more than 0.07 and 0.03 mag off the mean v and @xmath1 values , respectively , were discarded .",
    "the ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath25 values thus obtained were compared with @xmath27 s for the 55 objects with hipparcos @xmath0 magnitudes and @xmath28 s for the 24 objects with tycho colours , respectively .",

    "in general agreement is quite good , once differences in the atmospheric parameters and in the solar analysis are taken into account .",
    "the abundances presented in this paper are on the same scale as those of gratton et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , to which we refer for a thorough comparison with results from other authors .",
    "the overabundances of o and @xmath10 elements we find for the field subdwarfs is also similar to the excesses found for the globular cluster giants ( apart from those stars affected by the o - na anticorrelation , see kraft 1994 ) .",
    "table  [ t : mean ] gives the average element - to - iron abundance ratios for metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath50 ) obtained in this paper , along with the number of stars and the r.m.s scatter of individual stars around the mean value .",
    "averages are computed separately for mcdonald and asiago spectra .",
    "for comparison , we also give the same values derived from the analysis of carretta , gratton & sneden ( 1998 : o and mg ) and gratton & sneden ( 1991 : all other elements ) .",
    "these authors use an abundance analysis technique similar to that described in this paper , but different observational material .",
    "the agreement is excellent , in particular for the mcdonald spectra .",
    "once combined with the abundances obtained by gratton , carretta & castelli ( 1997 ) , the sample of late f to early k - type- field stars with internally homogenous and accurate high dispersion abundances includes nearly 400 stars . although the number of entries in this database may seem quite large , the vast majority of stars of these spectral classes ( the most useful in galactic evolution studies , and those to be used to derive ages for globular clusters via main - sequence fitting techniques ) present in the hipparcos catalogue still lack of accurate metal abundances",
    "however , schuster & nissen ( 1989 ) have shown that fairly accurate metal abundances for late f to early k - type can be obtained using the strmgren @xmath51  photometry , which is available for a considerable fraction of the hipparcos stars .",
    "furthermore , the extensive binary search by carney et al .",
    "( 1994 ) has provided a large number of metal abundances derived from an empirical calibration of the cross correlation dips for metal - poor dwarfs .",
    "finally , metal abundances from an index based on the strength of the ca  ii k line in low dispersion spectra have been obtained by ryan & norris ( 1991 ) . while the small scatter of the correlations with our abundances ( see below ) is testimonial to the efforts made by these authors to accurately calibrate their indices , their metallicity scales were at the mercy of a heterogenous collection of literature studies based on high dispersion analysis . in most cases these calibrating abundances",
    "were derived using model atmospheres different from kurucz ( 1993 ) , and unable to provide solar abundances in agreement with e.g. the meteoritic value .",
    "it is difficult to find out what solar abundance was used in these abundance systems .",
    "it is worthwhile to recalibrate these abundance scales .",
    "the schuster & nissen ( 1989 ) and carney et al .",
    "( 1994 ) abundances correlate very well with our high dispersion results .",
    "schuster & nissen s only differs by a zero point offset ( see panel _ a _ of figure  [ f : figure10 ] ) ; the mean difference is : @xmath52}_{\\rm us}={\\rm [ fe / h]}_{\\rm sn } + ( 0.102\\pm 0.012),\\ ] ] based on 152 stars ( the r.m.s .",
    "scatter for a single star is 0.151  dex ) .",
    "note that here we considered all the stars having high dispersion abundances from gratton , carretta & castelli ( 1997 ) and the present work , and for all these stars we derived abundances following the precepts of schuster & nissen ( 1989 ) .    in the case of carney et al .",
    "( 1994 : panel _ c _ of figure  [ f : figure10 ] ) , a small linear term is also required .",

    "+   ( 0.181\\pm 0.173),\\ ] ] where the error on the intercept is the r.m.s .",
    "scatter around the best fit line .",
    "finally , the scatter is somewhat larger for the abundances determined by ryan & norris ( 1991 : panel _ b _ of figure  [ f : figure10 ] ) .",
    "also , the range where these abundances are available is quite restricted ( [ fe / h]@xmath53 ) , because the used index saturate for more metal - rich stars .",
    "hence , only the offset can be determined .",
    "the best calibration we get ( excluding one star , g059 - 27 , which gives discrepant results ) is : @xmath52}_{\\rm us}={\\rm [ fe / h]}_{\\rm ryan \\ & norris } + ( 0.40\\pm 0.04),\\ ] ] with a r.m.s .",
    "scatter of 0.23 dex for individual stars .    the offsets between the high dispersion abundances and those provided by the above metallicity indicators are mainly due to different assumptions about the solar abundances in the high dispersion analyses originally used in the calibrations .",
    "in most cases , the stellar abundances were derived using the marcs grid of model atmospheres ( gustafsson et al .",
    "1975 ) , while the solar abundances obtained with the empirical model by holweger & mller ( 1974 ) were used .",
    "since the marcs solar model is much cooler in the line forming region than the holweger & mller s one , there is an offset of @xmath18  dex between solar and stellar abundances .",
    "this offset is canceled out when consistent model atmospheres are used for the sun and the stars ( e.g. the solar scaled atmospheres used sometimes , or model atmospheres extracted from the same grid ) .",
    "given the heterogenous nature of the calibrating samples , it is not possible to go further in detail .    once corrected to place them on our scale , errors ( derived from the r.m.s .",
    "scatter of differences with our estimates ) are 0.15  dex for abundances from the strmgren photometry and 0.18  dex for those derived from carney et al .",
    "for the stars having both ( independent ) estimates ( a large fraction of the over one thousands metal - poor dwarfs in the full hipparcos catalogue ) errors are as low as 0.12  dex .",
    "we have collected literature photometric data for a sample of 99 dwarfs with parallaxes measured by the hipparcos satellite , and high resolution spectra have been obtained for 66 of them .",
    "the photometric data were selected through a careful revision of the literature data , and were compared and implemented with the hipparcos / tycho photometric measurements in order to get a homogeneous , and accurate photometric data - base that includes johnson @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , cousins @xmath3 and strmgren @xmath4 s . typical accuracy are 0.014 , 0.011 , 0.016 and 0.022  mag in @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .    the spectroscopic data set consists of high dispersion ( @xmath7 ) , high @xmath8  ( @xmath9 ) spectra obtained at the asiago and mcdonald observatories .",

    "<S> homogeneous photometric data ( johnson @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , cousins @xmath3 and strmgren @xmath4 ) , radial velocities , and abundances of fe , o , mg , si , ca , ti , cr and ni are presented for 99 stars with high precision parallaxes measured by the hipparcos satellite . </S>",
    "<S> these data have been previously used to assist the derivation of accurate distances and ages of galactic globular clusters . </S>",
    "<S> magnitudes and colours for the programme stars were obtained combining and standardizing carefully selected literature data available in the simbad data - base and @xmath0 and @xmath1 values measured by the hipparcos / tycho mission . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of colours for our targets suggests : ( i ) ground - based and tycho @xmath1 s agree well for colours bluer than 0.75  mag , but have a lot of scatter for redder colours ; ( ii ) the hipparcos @xmath3 colours have a very large scatter and a zero point offset of + 0.02  mag compared to the literature values .    </S>",
    "<S> the programme stars have metal abundances in the range @xmath5[fe / h]@xmath6 . the spectroscopic observational data set consists of high dispersion ( @xmath7 ) , high @xmath8  ( @xmath9 ) spectra obtained at the asiago and mcdonald observatories for 66 stars . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is carried out following the same precepts used in previous papers of this series and includes corrections for departures from lte in the formation of the o lines . </S>",
    "<S> the main results are : ( i ) the equilibrium of ionization of fe is well satisfied in late f - early k - dwarfs ; ( ii ) oxygen and @xmath10elements are overabundant by @xmath11  dex .    </S>",
    "<S> this large homogeneous abundance data set has been used to recalibrate the abundance scales of schuster & nissen ( 1989 ) , carney et al . </S>",
