    "the tight correlation recently discovered between stellar velocity dispersion and black hole mass in nearby galaxy bulges @xcite has become the key to our understanding of black hole demographics , as well as a new tool for probing the evolution of galaxies and quasars . an equally important aspect of the @xmath4correlation is its predictive power . while dynamical mass measurements are observationally difficult and only possible for a limited number of galaxies , the @xmath4  relation makes it possible to obtain a black hole mass estimate good to @xmath11 accuracy or better from a single measurement of bulge velocity dispersion .",
    "having such a straightforward method to estimate black hole masses is a tremendous boon to studies of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , because @xmath12  is a fundamental parameter affecting the energetics and emission properties of agns . @xcite and @xcite have recently shown that black hole masses derived for seyfert galaxies via the @xmath4  relation are consistent with masses determined by reverberation mapping , providing added confidence that agns do follow the same correlation as inactive galaxies . for some classes of agns , using the correlations between @xmath12  and host galaxy properties may be the _ only _ reliable way to estimate the central masses .",
    "bl lac objects fall in this category , since more direct methods for determining @xmath12  ( stellar dynamics or reverberation mapping ) can not be applied .",
    "markarian 501 is one of the nearest known bl lac objects .",
    "its redshift is @xmath13 @xcite , corresponding to a distance of 144 mpc for @xmath14 km s@xmath3  mpc@xmath3 .",
    "the host of mrk 501 , also known as ugc 10599 , is a giant elliptical that appears morphologically normal in ground - based images @xcite .",
    "stellar absorption lines are visible in the nuclear spectrum , along with weak emission lines ( ulrich et al .  1975 ; stickel et al.1993 ) .",
    "mrk 501 is also a @xmath0-ray source , and is one of the few extragalactic objects from which tev emission has been detected @xcite .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we present new optical spectra of mrk 501 .",
    "the triplet lines are clearly detected , albeit substantially diluted by the nonthermal continuum .",
    "the stellar velocity dispersion measured from these lines is @xmath2 km s@xmath3 . using this result in conjunction with the @xmath4  correlation",
    ", we derive an estimate of the mass of the black hole in mrk 501 .",
    "observations were obtained with the palomar hale 200-inch telescope and double spectrograph @xcite on 2001 june 24 ut . on the red side , we used a 1200 grooves mm@xmath3  grating blazed at 9400  , and a wavelength setting giving coverage of 84359075   at 0.635 pixel@xmath3 . for the blue side",
    ", we used a 600 grooves mm@xmath3  grating blazed at 4000  , covering 42005950   at 1.72   pixel@xmath3 .",
    "a 2-wide slit was used for all observations .",
    "the total exposure time for mrk 501 was 3.5 hours , broken into individual 30-minute exposures .",
    "the airmass ranged between 1.01 and 1.20 during the observations , and the slit was held at a fixed position angle of 49 .",
    "there were intermittent thin clouds during the observations , and the seeing was typically @xmath15 .",
    "we observed mrk 501 again on june 26 , but due to thick clouds the data were of very poor quality and we do not include these exposures in our analysis .",
    "we also observed 24 stars as velocity templates during the observing run .",
    "the stars included giants , subgiants , and dwarfs with spectral types between f3 and k5 .",
    "each frame was bias - subtracted and flat - fielded using standard techniques .",
    "spectral extractions were performed using a width of 37 , corresponding to 8 pixels on the red side and 6 pixels on the blue side .",
    "the extractions were flux - calibrated using observations of the standard star bd + 174708 , and wavelength - calibrated using exposures of a he - ne - ar lamp , with a final linear shift based on the wavelengths of night sky emission lines .",
    "telluric absorption bands longward of 8925   were removed by dividing by the normalized spectrum of the standard star , but the corrected spectra are extremely noisy longward of 8950  . a few narrow , weak telluric features with equivalent widths of @xmath16 remain in the object spectra in the region 8800 - 8925  .",
    "these features could not be removed by standard star division since the standard star has intrinsic absorption features in this wavelength range that are comparable to , or stronger than , the telluric features .",
    "the spectrum of mrk 501 is displayed in figure [ figspect ] , along with the nearby elliptical galaxy ngc 4278 as a comparison .",
    "several stellar absorption features are clearly visible in the mrk 501 spectrum , despite the strong dilution by nonthermal emission .",
    "these include the triplet lines at @xmath17  , and on the blue side , the g band and _ b_. weak emission lines of [ ] @xmath18 are also detected in mrk 501 , but h@xmath19  emission is absent .",
    "the @xmath20 absorption line has an equivalent width of only @xmath21   ( in comparison with 34   in our k - giant stellar templates ) , indicating that the spectrum is dominated by nonthermal emission .",
    "to measure the velocity dispersion , we used a template fitting routine based on the method described by @xcite , which performs a direct fit of broadened stellar templates to the galaxy spectrum . the object and template spectra are first rebinned to a wavelength scale that is linear in @xmath22 .",
    "the template is broadened by convolution with a gaussian , and its spectral shape is adjusted with an additive dilution , representing the nonstellar continuum , and multiplication by a quadratic polynomial , to allow the continuum shape of the template to match the object .",
    "the galaxy s radial velocity is an additional free parameter in the fit .",
    "this procedure is repeated using a downhill simplex search algorithm @xcite , allowing all parameters to vary freely , to find the parameter values that minimize @xmath23 , yielding the best - fitting gaussian width @xmath8 .",
    "the fitting routine was tested with spectra of velocity dispersion standard galaxies from the catalog of @xcite that were observed during the same run , and in all cases our results agreed well with the previously measured values .",
    "the assumption of a gaussian for the line - of - sight velocity distribution is a reasonable choice given the relatively low signal - to - noise ratio of the mrk 501 spectrum ; our data do not have the sensitivity needed to detect higher - order moments of the velocity distribution .",
    "the high - velocity wings on the velocity profiles due to the central black hole should not be significant given the large spectroscopic aperture , which corresponds to 1.3 kpc @xmath24 2.0 kpc at the distance of mrk 501 .    for the red side spectrum , we chose a fitting region just large enough to contain the ca lines , 84758680  .",
    "the spectrum becomes extremely noisy beyond 8680   and we truncated the fit at that wavelength ; the red wing of the @xmath25 line is essentially lost in this portion of the spectrum due to the telluric water absorption band , even after division by the standard star .",
    "we excluded a few remaining weak telluric features from the fit , including one located in the blue wing of the @xmath20 absorption feature .",
    "the best - fitting template is hd 188056 , a k3iii star ( figure [ figfit ] ) . with this template , the derived velocity dispersion is @xmath26 km s@xmath3 , and the standard deviation among all templates observed during the run is 17 km s@xmath3 .",
    "since template mismatch is the dominant source of uncertainty in the measurement , we combine the template - matching and fitting uncertainties in quadrature for a final result of @xmath27 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the ca triplet region is expected to be less sensitive to stellar population variations than the blue spectral region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so the fit to the ca lines should give the best estimate of the velocity dispersion .",
    "we also performed fits to several portions of the blue spectrum , and found that the best results were obtained for a region just redward of the _ b _  line .",
    "b_line itself did not match the template spectra well , however , and it was excluded from the final fits . over the range 5200 - 5600  , the best - fitting template was the k3iii star hd 125560 , giving @xmath28 km s@xmath3 , in reasonable agreement with the red side results .",
    "however , several of the template stars gave very poor fits , and the standard deviation among all templates for this region was 81 km s@xmath3 .",
    "if we assume that mrk 501 follows the @xmath4  relation defined for nearby galaxies , then it is straightforward to convert our measurement of @xmath8  into an estimate of @xmath12 .",
    "this assumption is supported by the fact that the mrk 501 host galaxy appears morphologically undisturbed , without any indications of recent major merger or interaction events that might cause the galaxy to deviate from the correlation .",
    "the most recent fits to the @xmath4  relation are given by @xcite , who find @xmath29 , and by @xcite , who find @xmath30 . given the disagreement between these two groups , the most conservative approach is to apply both relations and derive a range of possible black hole masses for mrk 501 .",
    "another issue is the fact that @xcite use the luminosity - weighted velocity dispersion within the half - light radius , while @xcite base their fit on the `` central '' velocity dispersion measured within an aperture of radius @xmath31 . for our purposes ,",
    "the distinction between these two choices is not large ; @xcite show that variations in luminosity - weighted velocity dispersion for apertures of different size rarely exceed 10% for @xmath32 .",
    "one possibility would be to use the prescription of @xcite to normalize our measured aperture dispersion to @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "however , this would introduce additional uncertainty as the value of @xmath33 for mrk 501 is not well constrained by existing ground - based imaging data .",
    "values for @xmath33 compiled from the literature by @xcite range from 9  to 20 .",
    "thus , we use our measured velocity dispersion without applying any aperture corrections .    propagating the uncertainty in @xmath8  as well as the uncertainties in the coefficients of the @xmath4  relation , the black hole in mrk 501",
    "has @xmath35 @xmath6  with the @xcite fit , or @xmath36 @xmath6  with the @xcite fit , for a @xmath37 allowed range of @xmath38 @xmath6 . given this result ,",
    "the projected radius of the gravitational sphere of influence ( @xmath39 ) of the black hole in mrk 501 is expected to be @xmath40 .",
    "this raises the possibility that a genuine stellar - dynamical mass measurement could be done with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , if @xmath12  is in the upper half of this uncertainty range .",
    "the main caveat to this result is that the upper end of the @xmath4correlation is rather uncertain at present . in the range",
    "@xmath41 @xmath6 , there are as yet only three galaxies with dynamical @xmath12measurements derived from _ hst _  data . _ hst _  programs currently in progress will rectify this situation during the next few years with many additional measurements , giving better constraints on the amount of intrinsic scatter in the @xmath4  relation in this mass range .",
    "the correlation between black hole mass and galaxy bulge luminosity can also be used to obtain black hole mass estimates .",
    "the mrk 501 host galaxy has a total @xmath42 magnitude of 14.4 ( stickel et al .",
    "1993 ) . correcting for galactic extinction of @xmath43 mag @xcite and applying",
    "a @xmath44-correction of 0.16 mag @xcite , the galaxy has @xmath45 mag for @xmath46 km s@xmath3  mpc@xmath3 . from the fit to the @xmath47 correlation given by @xcite , the expected mass is @xmath48 @xmath6 .",
    "while this value is outside our @xmath37 uncertainty range on @xmath12  from the @xmath4relation , the scatter in the @xmath47 correlation is more than an order of magnitude in @xmath12  at fixed @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "also , the host galaxy luminosity is rather uncertain ; the values compiled from the literature by @xcite show a range of @xmath50 mag among different authors .",
    "( we note that for the adopted luminosity , the galaxy lies very close to the mean faber - jackson relation for nearby ellipticals . )",
    "thus , the level of disagreement between these two @xmath12  estimates is not a cause for concern ; m87 is an outlier by a similar amount in the @xmath9 correlation .",
    "the @xmath4  relation is a much more reliable predictor of @xmath12  because its intrinsic scatter is much smaller , less than @xmath51 @xcite and possibly near zero @xcite .",
    "some previous estimates of the black hole mass in mrk 501 have been obtained by examination of the spectrum and variability of its nonthermal emission .",
    "for example , @xcite derive @xmath12  by combining the variability timescale ( from which they estimate the physical size of the emitting region ) with the assumption that the @xmath0-rays in blazars are produced at @xmath52 schwarzschild radii from the black hole . for mrk 501 and seven other @xmath0-ray blazars",
    ", they find central masses in the range @xmath53 @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite interpret the periodic behavior observed in x - ray and @xmath0-ray light curves as evidence for a binary black hole in mrk 501 , and propose a geometric model for a jet originating from the less massive black hole to estimate @xmath54 @xmath6  and @xmath55 @xmath6  for the two components of the binary .",
    "recently , @xcite have devised a method to estimate @xmath12  in blazars from the peak luminosity and peak frequency . using data for a large sample ( but not including mrk 501 ) ,",
    "they show that their method implies masses of @xmath56 @xmath6  for low - frequency peaked blazars , and @xmath57 @xmath6  for high - frequency peaked blazars .",
    "however , these methods have not been calibrated for galaxies whose black hole masses have been measured dynamically , so it is difficult to assess their accuracy .",
    "black hole masses below @xmath58 @xmath6  in bl lac objects would be difficult to reconcile with the @xmath12@xmath59correlation , since _",
    "_  imaging has conclusively demonstrated that most bl lac hosts are luminous ellipticals @xcite .",
    "in addition , masses of @xmath60 @xmath6  would pose a problem for unified models of radio - loud agns , in which bl lacs are interpreted as radio galaxies oriented with the radio jet along our line of sight ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "nearby fr i radio galaxies , which would presumably appear as bl lac objects if viewed pole - on , have black holes with masses in the range @xmath61 @xmath6(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , for mrk 501 , the central mass derived from either @xmath62 or @xmath49 is consistent with the range of masses expected from unified schemes .",
    "the eddington ratio of the active nucleus in mrk 501 can be determined if its bolometric luminosity is known .",
    "only indirect estimates of @xmath63  are possible , since the observed nonthermal emission is highly beamed . one way to estimate @xmath63  is by comparison with fr i radio galaxies , the unbeamed counterparts of bl lac objects .",
    "bolometric luminosities for four nearby fr i radio galaxies ( m84 , m87 , ngc 6251 , and ngc 4261 ) are available from @xcite , and nuclear emission - line measurements for these objects are listed by @xcite and @xcite . for these four galaxies ,",
    "the ratio @xmath64(h@xmath65+[])/@xmath63  has a mean value of @xmath66 with a scatter of only @xmath67 over an order of magnitude range in @xmath63 .",
    "mrk 501 has @xmath64(h@xmath65 + [ ] ) @xmath68 erg s@xmath3  ( stickel et al .  1993 ) . if its @xmath64(h@xmath65+[])/@xmath63ratio is similar to these local fr i galaxies , as might be expected from unified models , then it has @xmath69 erg s@xmath3  and @xmath10 .",
    "mrk 501 is evidently an extremely sub - eddington accretor ; this strengthens previous indications that nearby tev - emitting blazars are intrinsically weak agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the correlations between @xmath12  and host galaxy properties make it possible to consider new tests of agn unification scenarios , by examining the distributions of black hole masses and eddington ratios between different classes of agns .",
    "such tests have been performed using the host galaxy luminosity to estimate @xmath12  @xcite , but a comparison based on stellar velocity dispersion would provide improved constraints on the central masses , and new probes of the demographics of agn classes such as fr i and fr ii radio galaxies and blazars . also , it would be worthwhile to test whether the black hole masses differ systematically between high- and low - frequency peaked blazars , as advocated by wang et al .",
    "it should be possible to measure stellar velocity dispersions in several other low - redshift bl lac objects . at recession velocities beyond 12,000 km s@xmath3",
    ", the ca @xmath20 line will be redshifted into telluric h@xmath70o absorption bands and difficult to measure accurately , but the _ b _  spectral region will still be observable .",
