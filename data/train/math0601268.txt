    "however , the tower can still be defined even for @xmath25 .    the definition of the stages @xmath26 simplifies for @xmath7 and in fact reduces to a very concrete construction .",
    "namely , let @xmath27 , @xmath28 , be a collection of disjoint intervals in @xmath1 , and define spaces of `` punctured long knots '' as homotopy fibers @xmath29 for each nonempty subset @xmath30 of @xmath31 . since there are restriction maps @xmath32 which commute , the @xmath33 can be arranged in a subcubical diagram ( a cubical diagram without the initial space ) of dimension @xmath21 .",

    "one also recovers theorem  [ t : kontsevich ] as a corollary .",
    "another important connection between _ integral _ finite type theory and embedding calculus is the work of budney , conant , scannell , and sinha @xcite , who study the first three stages of the ordinary taylor tower in detail . using the mapping space model for the tower",
    ", they further give a new geometric interpretation of the unique ( up to framing ) integral type 2 invariant via quadrisecants .",
    "their main result , which in fact holds for @xmath131 rather than @xmath14 , is    ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 6.3)[t : integraltype2 ] the map @xmath132 represents the unique integral additive type 2 invariant .",
    "some further questions are :    * sinha s cohomology spectral sequence may not converge to the totalization of @xmath62 for @xmath25 because it is not clear that @xmath133 commutes with totalization .",
    "further , the taylor tower is not known to converge to the space of knots . another way to say",
    "this is that the maps @xmath134 are not known to be isomorphisms .",
    "if the spectral sequence indeed does not converge to the desired associated graded , then does the genuine taylor tower for @xmath14 contain more information than just the finite type invariants ?",
    "the work in @xcite indicates that this might be the case .",
    "conant has further shown that type @xmath119 invariants show up in stage @xmath135 of the ordinary tower , rather than stage @xmath136 as is the case in the algebraic tower . *",
    "a very closely related question is that of separation of knots by finite type invariants .",
    "since theorem  [ t : intromaintheorem1 ] states that rational finite type invariants are all one finds on the right side of the map @xmath137 , showing that @xmath137 and @xmath138 are surjections would settle the question of finite type invariants separating knots .",
    "* as conjectured in @xcite , can one construct all integral finite type invariants using the collection of evaluation maps and the mapping space model for the taylor tower ?",
    "what are the analogs of quadrisecants for higher order finite type invariants ? * can we show collapse of vassiliev s spectral sequence for @xmath14 directly ?",
    "what are the convergence issues there ? * can one gain topological insight into the common thread between knots in @xmath139 and @xmath140 , namely the kontsevich and bott - taubes integral constructions of finite type invariants ?",
    "this is to be expected , since the latter type of integrals plays a crucial role in the proof of theorem  [ t : intromaintheorem1 ] .",
    "* can we use calculus of functors to study finite type invariants of braids or homology spheres , for example ?",
    "there is another brand of calculus of functors , _ orthogonal calculus _ , due to weiss @xcite , which can be used for studying @xmath7 .",
    "here one considers covariant functors from the category of vector spaces with isometric linear inclusions to the category of spaces or spectra .",
    "to such a functor , orthogonal calculus associates a different taylor tower , whose layers ( fibers of the maps between the stages ) are spectra with actions of the orthogonal groups .",
    "the main ingredient in the proof of this theorem is again the formality of the chains of little cubes operad combined with the interplay between embedding calculus ( which views @xmath142 as a functor of @xmath15 ) and orthogonal calculus ( which views @xmath142 as a functor of @xmath2 ) .",
    "an immediate consequence is      * combining the first statement in corollary  [ c : formalityconsequences ] with corollary  [ c : orthogonalcollapse ] for @xmath144 , we have that the @xmath70 term of the orthogonal calculus cohomology spectral sequence has to be isomorphic , up to regrading , to the @xmath70 term of the vassiliev spectral sequence for @xmath7 , @xmath11 ( although this has not yet been verified directly ) .",
    "can studying the layers of the orthogonal tower , whose explicit description is given in @xcite , give more insight into the combinatorics of the vassiliev spectral sequence an help in computations ?",
