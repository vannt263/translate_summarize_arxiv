    "a membrane is understood as a mapping from two - dimensional surface @xmath0 to @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath0 is of sphere topology , the image @xmath2 corresponds to a spherical membrane .",
    "the shape of @xmath2 is governed by surface tension energy and bending energy , as it is assumed in the surface model of helfrich and polyakov ( hp ) @xcite . as a general framework for phase transitions ,",
    "the landau - ginzburg free energy is also assumed @xcite for membranes , where the tangential vector @xmath3 of the surface is an order parameter . owing to such mathematical backgrounds , the surface shape and its phase structure",
    "have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "almost all shape transformations in membranes are concerned with anisotropic phases such as tubular and planar ( or prolate , oblate ) phases .",
    "an anisotropic phase was predicted in a surface model with a bending rigidity which is anisotropic in the internal direction of the surface @xcite , and the existence of such anisotropic surface was numerically confirmed @xcite .",
    "these anisotropic surface models have also been studied by non - perturbative renormalization group formalization @xcite . moreover",
    ", a tubular surface can also be seen in a surface model with elastic skeleton , where one - dimensional bending energy is assumed @xcite .",
    "however , the origin of the anisotropy in membranes still remains to be clarified .",
    "indeed , it is unclear why the bending rigidity becomes isotropic ( or anisotropic ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is well - known that there exist anisotropic membranes without skeletons @xcite .",
    "an origin of the anisotropic surface shape is considered to be connected with the direction of liquid crystal molecules in liquid crystal elastomers ( lces ) membrane @xcite .",
    "the non - polar orientation property is always assumed for the liquid crystal molecules .",
    "for this reason the mechanical strength of lces depends on whether the molecules are aligned or not . on the other hand ,",
    "the dynamical variables of the hp surface model mentioned above are the surface position @xmath4 and the metric @xmath5 of @xmath0 .",
    "for this reason , one possible explanation for the anisotropic surface shape is that the metric @xmath5 is anisotropic and this anisotropy is represented in @xmath2 in the hp model .",
    "thus , recalling that the finsler metric reflects a space anisotropy in general @xcite , we can implement the molecular orientation property in the hp model by replacing the riemmanian metric @xmath5 with the finsler metric @xmath6 .",
    "in other words , the molecular orientation property can geometrically be implemented in the context of hp model on the basis of finsler geometry , and as a consequence the surface anisotropy can be explained naturally .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to study a surface model on the basis of finsler geometry @xcite . in finsler geometry ,",
    "an infinitesimal length unit is considered to be dependent on the directions , and it gives a more general framework than the riemannian geometry @xcite . because of the length unit anisotropy , we expect that the surface force in membranes ( such as the surface tension and the bending rigidity ) naturally becomes anisotropic if the finsler geometry can be implemented in the surface models . those finsler geometric ( fg ) surface models are expected to provide us a natural framework for describing anisotropic shape transformations in membranes .    in this paper , a finsler geometric surface model for membranes",
    "is studied and monte carlo ( mc ) simulation data are presented .",
    "this model is constructed by extending a discrete surface model of helfrich and polyakov such that the metric function is replaced by a finsler metric .",
    "the assumed finsler metric is defined by using a vector filed @xmath7 on @xmath0 . since the @xmath7 has its own direction on the surface ,",
    "this vector field @xmath7 is considered to be an origin of surface anisotropy .",
    "we should note that the isotropy is restored if @xmath7 is given locally at random . in this case",
    ", the fg model should have the same phase structure as the conventional surface model of helfrich and polyakov .",
    "we firstly check this under several conditions and confirm that the fg surface model is well - defined .",
    "nextly , it is demonstrated that anisotropic surfaces are obtained when @xmath7 is constant and treated as a dynamical variable with the heisenberg spin model hamiltonian .",
    "in this subsection , we briefly summarize the elements of finsler geometry @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a two - dimensional manifold , and let @xmath8 be a curve on @xmath0 such that @xmath9 .",
    "we call @xmath0 a _ finsler space _ if there exists a finsler funtion @xmath10 on @xmath0 such that the finsler length @xmath11 of the curve @xmath8 is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a homogeneous function of degree @xmath14 with respect to @xmath15 . the symbols",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 in @xmath10 denote a point on @xmath8 and a tangential vector at @xmath18 with the direction along which @xmath19 increases , respectively .",
    "thus , we have @xmath20 for any positive @xmath21 .",
    "this equation implies that the finsler length @xmath11 of the curve @xmath8 is independent of the parameter @xmath19 .",
    "for this reason , the finsler length @xmath11 depends only on the ratio @xmath22 , because @xmath23 can be replaced by @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ length_constraint ] ) .",
    "we should note that the definition of eq .",
    "( [ length_curve ] ) can also be written as @xmath25    an example of the finsler function @xmath26 is given by using a vector field @xmath7 such that @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "we call @xmath29 and @xmath30 the euclidean lengths . note that the reparametrization @xmath31 allows us to write @xmath32 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath33 .",
    "this leads to the expression @xmath11 in eq .",

    "let @xmath34 be the tangential plane at @xmath18 .",
    "then , we have a loop made of all end points of the vectors @xmath35 satisfying @xmath36 this equation is obtained by assuming @xmath37 in eq .",

    "the finsler length of @xmath41 is constant , which is 1 in the unit of @xmath42 , and hence it is independent of the direction on the loop .    in the example in eq .",
    "( [ example ] ) , the euclidean length of @xmath11 is given by @xmath43 , which is identical to the finsler length if @xmath44 , and hence finsler length @xmath11 along @xmath8 is implicitly dependent on @xmath7 along the direction of @xmath15 .",
    "thus , we find that the finsler length @xmath11 defined at @xmath18 on @xmath0 depends both on the direction of @xmath7 and on the length of @xmath7 .",
    "since the length of @xmath7 is dependent on @xmath18 , the finsler length depends on the position and the direction .",
    "we assume that @xmath0 is smoothly or piece - wise linearly triangulated in such a way that the euclidean bond lengths are given .",
    "the vertices , the bonds , and the triangles are independently labeled on the triangulated surfaces by sequential numbers .",
    "let @xmath45 , and @xmath46 be respectively the total number of vertices , the total number of bonds and the total number of triangles .",
