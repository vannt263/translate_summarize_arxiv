    "expanding maps of the unit interval have been widely studied in the last decades and the associated transfer operators have proven to be of vital importance in solving problems concerning the statistical behaviour of the underlying interval maps @xcite .    in recent years",
    "an increasing amount of interest has developed in maps which are expanding everywhere except on an unstable fixed point ( that is , an indifferent fixed point ) at which trajectories are considerably slowed down .",
    "this leads to an interplay of chaotic and regular dynamics , a characteristic of intermittent systems @xcite . from an ergodic theory viewpoint",
    ", this phenomenon leads to an absolutely continuous invariant measure having infinite mass .",
    "therefore , standard methods of ergodic theory can not be applied in this setting ; indeed it is wellknown that birkhoff s ergodic theorem does not hold under these circumstances , see for instance @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will be concerned with @xmath0-farey maps , see figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "these maps are of great interest since they are piecewise linear and expanding everywhere except for at the indifferent fixed point where they have ( right ) derivative one .",
    "this makes the @xmath0-farey maps a simple model for studying the physical phenomenon of intermittency @xcite .",
    "moreover , an induced version of the @xmath0-farey maps are given by the @xmath0-lroth maps introduced in @xcite , which have significant meaning in number theory , see for instance @xcite .",
    "thaler @xcite was the first to discern the asymptotics of the transfer operator of a class of interval maps preserving an infinite measure .",
    "this class of maps , to which the @xmath0-farey maps do not belong , have become to be known as thaler maps . in an effort to generalise this work , by combining renewal theoretical arguments and functional analytic techniques , a new approach to estimate the decay of correlation of a dynamical system",
    "was achieved by sarig @xcite .",

    "thus , the question which naturally arises is , whether this asymptotic rate can be related to the asymptotic rate of convergence of iterates of the actual transfer operator .",
    "the results of this paper give some positive answers to this question for @xmath1-expansive @xmath0-farey maps .    as mentioned above , in this paper",
