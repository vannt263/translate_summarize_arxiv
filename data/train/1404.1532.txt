    "thus , we found no indication of spectral variation as a function of the pulsar phase .",
    "following the method reported in @xcite , we detected and selected the agn - like serendipitous sources in the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ fovs ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",

    "this points to the absence of thick molecular clouds in the _ xmm - newton _ fov . since n@xmath37 obtained from x - ray absorption probes all types of nuclei along the line of sight , whereas the latter value samples only atomic hydrogen , this observed value of n@xmath36 is to be expected @xcite .",
    "apart from the pulsar itself , the main feature apparent in the pn fov is the pwn emission . to find the best extraction regions for the pulsar and the nebula , as well as to better evaluate the pwn shape , we created exposure - corrected radial ( around the pulsar ) and linear ( parallel and orthogonal to the main axis of the nebula ) brightness profiles in the 0.3 - 10 kev energy range .",
    "the radial profile is consistent ( @xmath33 = 0.14 ) with the nominal instrument psf @xcite only up to 40@xmath18 from the pulsar due to the relative faintness of the nebula .",
    "the linear profile , with 1@xmath15 width centered on the pulsar and orthogonal to the main axis of the nebula , is also consistent ( @xmath33 = 0.009 ) with the psf , proving the absence of a detectable nebular component in the orthogonal region .",
    "the presence of the nebula in the profile parallel to the main axis is apparent , extending up to @xmath40 from the pulsar and with flux decreasing with distance ( apparent in figure  [ fig1 ] , see also * ? ? ?",

    "using a 25@xmath18 radius extraction circle around the pulsar , we obtained 9794 , 2983 and 3073 counts in the 0.3 - 10 kev energy range in the pn and the two mos detectors , respectively , with a background contribution of less than 4% .",
    "we also used 19380 pulsar counts from the _ chandra _ observations . for the spectral analysis",
    ", we followed @xcite . to better constrain the column density , we fitted the nebular spectra together with the pulsar spectrum .",

    "all the parameters of the spectra from the corresponding regions in _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations were linked , also freezing the absorption column to the previously fitted value .",

    ", we evaluated the background contribution , the pulsar blackbody , and the power law components in different energy ranges , as in @xcite .",
    "we obtained a background - subtracted pulsed fraction of 36.1@xmath171.5% in the 0.3 - 10 kev energy range . dividing the energy range into low energy ( 0.3 - 0.7 kev , where the blackbody accounts for @xmath260% of the counts ) and high - energy bands ( 0.7 - 10 kev , where the power law accounts for @xmath290% of the counts ) we obtained pulsed fractions of 35.8@xmath171.5% and 36.4@xmath171.5% , respectively .",
    "we know the pulsed fraction in each band and the percentage of blackbody , power - law and background contributions , so that we can get the net pulsed fraction of the two spectral components .",
    "the pulsar s power law is pulsed at @xmath238% and the blackbody component at @xmath236% . while at lower energies the curve is quasi - sinusoidal ( a fit with a sinusoid gives @xmath41=1.31 , 17 dof , @xmath33=0.17 ) due to the blackbody contribution , the profile at higher energies is not compatible with a sinusoid ( @xmath41=2.70 , 17 dof , @xmath33=10@xmath59 ) .",
    "the correlation of the power - law photon index with its normalization ( see e.g. figure  [ fig6 ] ) somewhat biases the normalization profile in figure  [ fig5 ] , while the counts profiles in figure  [ fig4 ] are better suited for comparing their shapes .",
    "the peak positions at low ( 0.3 - 0.7 kev ) and high ( 0.7 - 10 kev ) x - ray energies are separated by less than @xmath60 in phase , but they are offset by about a half - rotation from the main @xmath0-ray pulse and the radio pulse ( following @xcite , the radio pulse leads the @xmath0-ray pulse by 0.074@xmath170.006 in phase ) .",
    "to search for possible variation of the x - ray spectral parameters with rotational phase , we first fitted the on- and off - pulse spectra . we define the on - pulse interval to be between phase 0.3 and 0.8 ( values obtained from a fit with a double - step model ) , and the remaining phase bins as off - pulse .",
    "fitting only the power - law counts ( e@xmath320.7 kev ) , we fixed the column density and the photon index to the phase - averaged values , obtaining an acceptable @xmath33=0.047 ( @xmath41=1.21 , 143 dof ) . freeing both the normalization and photon indices we obtain an improved fit ( @xmath33=0.22 , @xmath41=1.09 , 141 dof ) .",

    "a variation of the blackbody temperature with pulsar phase is not statistically compelling ; however , the high pulsed fraction at low energies implies significant pulsation of the blackbody normalization .",
    "the blackbody normalization and power - law normalization and photon index vary with pulsar phase .",

    "the variation with blackbody normalization is similar .",
    "by analyzing the new _ xmm - newton _ observation of psr j1741@xmath12054 , we fully characterized the high - energy emission of this nearby middle - aged radio - faint pulsar .",

    "these observations could also provide a measurement of the pulsar proper motion .",
    "such an analysis is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "modeling the x - ray spectrum of the pulsar requires a composite model , summing thermal and non - thermal components .",
    "both components are @xmath235 - 40% pulsed , with single - peaked light curves and maxima phase - aligned to within @xmath60 in phase .",
    "while the thermal light curve is compatible with a sinusoid , the non - thermal profile has a sharper peak .",
    "the best - fitting thermal spectrum yields a temperature ( @xmath61 k ) , compatible with the theoretical expectations for the cooling of a 390 kyr - old pulsar @xcite .",
    "we note that the best fit temperature of the nsa model ( @xmath62 k ) is below the theoretical expectations , further disfavoring such a model . a pulsed component from thermal cooling",
    "has already been noted for several pulsars @xcite , and that of psr j1057@xmath15226 has a similar pulsed component .",
    "such pulsations can be ascribed to a dependence of the observed emitting area on the line of sight .",
    "@xcite describe a magnetospheric @xmath22blanket@xmath23 caused by cyclotron resonance scattering off the plasma in the magnetosphere that could screen the thermally emitting surface during specific phase intervals , depending on the magnetic field configuration and viewing geometry .",
    "anisotropic heat transfer from the pulsar interior can also explain flux variation across the neutron star surface @xcite .",
    "if the thermal component is due to the cooling of the entire neutron star surface ( 12 km radius ) , from the thermal normalization in the best fit spectrum ( that depends only on the pulsar distance and the emitting radius ) we can derive the pulsar distance to be @xmath2850 pc , with 3@xmath63 limits of @xmath2650 and @xmath21100 pc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , thermal emission from polar caps heated due to downstreaming of @xmath64 @xcite , as seen in the case of psr j0007 + 7303 in the cta 1 supernova remnant , is expected to be generated from much smaller regions ( @xmath65100 m , based on a simple @xmath22centered@xmath23 dipole magnetic field geometry , @xcite ) , which would imply an unrealistic pulsar distance smaller than 10 pc .",
    "distances lower than a few hundred parsecs are greatly disfavored due to the non - negligible value of the column density ( about one fourth of the total galactic column density in this direction ) .",
    "we note that a distance of 850 pc would result in a 110% @xmath0-ray efficiency , defined as @xmath66 , with @xmath67 the luminosity above 100 mev .",
    "the distance range cited above implies an efficiency range of 60 to 180% .",
    "similarly , the x - ray efficiency would be @xmath21.2% ( 0.7 to 2.1% ) .",
    "such an unrealistic @xmath0-ray efficiency could be explained by a beaming factor f@xmath68 less than 1 ( as defined in 2pc ) , or by a moment of inertia larger than 10@xmath69 g @xmath5 .",
    "a 10-bin phase - resolved x - ray spectral analysis reveals variations in the x - ray photon index , in addition to the phase - varying normalizations of the two spectral components , with a softer spectrum during the on - pulse phases ( figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "it is difficult to compare the behavior of j1741 with that of other _ fermi _ pulsars , since the crab is the only one for which such variation was detected , and the crab s non - thermal spectrum becomes softer in the primary - pulse maximum and harder during the bridge between the two maxima @xcite .",
    "although some models have been developed to explain the crab s optical - to-@xmath0-ray behavior ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the physics behind the pulsar s x - ray photon index variations is still unclear .",
    "moreover , unlike the crab , the @xmath0-ray , x - ray and radio peaks of psr j1741@xmath12054 are not aligned , pointing to a clear difference in the geometry and/or altitude above the neutron star surface of the different emitting regions .",
    "indeed , the @xmath0-ray and x - ray peaks are phase - offset by roughly a half rotation , as is also seen in psrs j0007 + 7303 , j1057@xmath15226 and j0659 + 1414 @xcite .",
    "although these differences are expected from different models for the radio and @xmath0-ray bands @xcite , no model is able to account for the offset between @xmath0-ray and x - ray peaks .",
    "the alignment between the thermal and non - thermal x - rays ( seen also in other pulsars , e.g. j0659 + 1414 and j1057@xmath15226 ) , as well as the phase lag with the @xmath0-ray emission coming from the outer magnetosphere , can suggest that the non - thermal emission is generated in a region near the pulsar poles ( e.g. in a polar cap emission model ) .",
    "also , the low x - ray luminosity of radio - quiet pulsars in the x - ray band @xcite suggests that the radio and x - ray emission regions may be in close proximity .",
    "the origin of the phase lag between the radio and x - ray light curves is unclear .",

    "<S> we report the results of a deep _ xmm - newton _ observation of the radio - faint @xmath0-ray pulsar j1741@xmath12054 and its nebula together with the analysis of five years of _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) data . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray spectrum of the pulsar is consistent with an absorbed power law plus a blackbody , originating at least partly from the neutron star cooling . </S>",
    "<S> the nebular emission is consistent with that of a synchrotron pulsar wind nebula , with hints of spatial spectral variation . </S>",
    "<S> we extended the available _ fermi _ lat ephemeris and folded the @xmath0-ray and x - ray data . </S>",
    "<S> we detected x - ray pulsations from the neutron star : both the thermal and non - thermal components are @xmath235 - 40% pulsed , with phase - aligned maxima . </S>",
    "<S> a sinusoid fits the thermal folded profile well . a 10-bin phase - resolved analysis of the x - ray emission shows softening of the non - thermal spectrum during the on - pulse phases . the radio , x - ray and @xmath0-ray light curves are single - peaked , not phase - aligned , with the x - ray peak trailing the @xmath0-ray peak by over half a rotation . </S>",
    "<S> spectral considerations suggest that the most probable pulsar distance is in the 0.3 - 1.0 kpc range , in agreement with the radio dispersion measure . </S>"
