    "the two most efficient ways of identifying galaxies at high redshifts are first , the lyman break broadband - droput technique , and second , observations at submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "for example , surveys with the submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope reveal high - redshift objects via emission from the cold dust they contain @xcite .",
    "conventional wisdom is that the submillimeter observations preferentially select starburst galaxies at @xmath3 because the far - infrared luminosity peak shifts into the submillimeter band @xcite .",
    "most scuba sources are too faint in the optical and near - infrared bands for spectroscopic identification , but @xcite and @xcite have confirmed that most scuba sources in their sample are at @xmath3 . despite all the effort that has gone into scuba searches , lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) still constitute by far the largest well - studied rest - frame - uv selected galaxy samples at high redshift @xcite .",
    "the relation between lbgs and scuba galaxies remains unclear , but recently @xcite have confirmed that some scuba galaxies have the typical rest - frame uv colors as lbgs at @xmath4@xcite . understanding both populations requires a direct comparison of properties , such as stellar mass and dust emission .",
    "the four bands viewed by the infrared array camera ( irac ) aboard spitzer , from 3.6@xmath5 m to 8.0@xmath5 m , cover spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for galaxies at @xmath0 in the rest - frame near - infrared , where the luminosities are good indicators of stellar mass @xcite .",
    "the multiband imaging photometer for sirtf ( mips ) 24@xmath5 m band is an ideal probe of the pah and hot dust emission from lbgs and scuba galaxies .",
    "preliminary studies show that spitzer can easily detect both lbgs and scuba galaxies @xcite .",
    "this letter presents the first study of a large lbg sample in the extended groth strip ( egs ) region based on spitzer observations carried out with deep irac and mips photometry .",
    "we report discovering a new type of lbg , the infrared - luminous lbg ( illbg ) with strong infrared emission at rest - frame 6@xmath5 m , whose properties are very similar to those of scuba galaxies .",
    "illbgs are massive , dusty , and powered mainly by extremely rapid star formation .",
    "irac @xcite observations of the egs were carried out in two epochs : 2004 january and june , covering a @xmath6 strip .",
    "the mips observations were done in 2004 june in scanning mode . limiting flux densities ( 5@xmath7 )",
    "are roughly 0.5@xmath5jy at 3.6 and 4.5 , 2.7@xmath5jy at 5.8 and 8.0 , and 60@xmath5jy at 24@xmath5 m .",
    "we use the same data reduction procedure for both irac and mips data as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the lbg sample in the egs area was taken from @xcite . among a total of 334 objects in the @xcite catalog , 188",
    "are spectroscopically identified as galaxies at z@xmath83 , 3 are qsos , 3 are agn , and 7 are stars . the remaining 133 objects are not identified . in the photometric catalog",
    "253 objects are in the area covered by both irac and mips imaging . of these ,",
    "211 are detected at 3.6@xmath5 m , 199 at 4.5@xmath5 m , 53 at 5.8@xmath5 m , and 44 at 8.0@xmath5 m .",
    "we detect 11 lbg counterparts in the mips 24@xmath5 m image including all 3 qsos and 1 agn identified by @xcite .",
    "of them on the sky .",
    "given the angular resolution of mips , we can not be sure which objects are responsible for the 24  flux , and to be conservative we do not count these two as 24  lbg detections . ]",
    "the 24@xmath5m - detected counterparts are also detected at all shorter wavelengths and are among the brightest sources in the sample .",
    "we define the lbgs with 24 @xmath5 m detections ( @xmath9 ) as infrared - luminous lyman break galaxies ( illbgs ) .",
    "the 24@xmath5 m limiting flux is equivalent to @xmath10 @xmath11 for galaxies at @xmath12 , or @xmath13 if we use the m82 sed to convert the luminosity at 6.2@xmath5 m to the total infrared luminosity .",
    "we compare the lbg sample with a set of lockman hole area scuba sources having secure identifications @xcite.mips area have good radio observations @xcite , but none of the counterparts thereby identified has a known redshift .",
    "in fact , seds suggest that at least two of the four are at @xmath14 .",
    "thus the egs scuba sources do not provide a useful comparison sample , and we compare the egs lbgs with the lockman hole scuba sources instead . ]",
    "@xcite classified these scuba sources into two types ( cold and warm ) based on the dust temperature inferred from their seds .",
    "the cold sources exhibit the 1.6@xmath5 m h@xmath15 opacity minimum bump in the irac bands , a stellar feature typically seen in galaxy seds .",
    "the cold scuba sources are well approximated by the sed of arp 220 , a cold dusty starburst .",
    "the warm sources are agn - dominated with a power - law continuum sed , similar to that of mrk 231 .",
    "there are four cold and two warm sources in the lockman hole scuba sample @xcite .",
    "the lbgs exhibit a much wider range of flux densities in the irac bands than in the k band . figure  1 shows that the range of 3.6@xmath5 m flux densities for the lbgs spans 4 magnitudes compared to only 1.5 magnitudes for the range of k - band flux density seen by @xcite .",
    "figure  1 also shows a correlation between [ 3.6 ] and @xmath16 $ ] for lbgs .",
    "this relation is partially due to a selection effect ( all lbgs are brighter than @xmath17 @xcite ) , but there is an obvious absence of lbgs with blue colors at higher 3.6@xmath5 m flux densities .",
    "all illbgs ( as defined above ) are redder than @xmath16=1.5 $ ] , and most have @xmath16>2.4 $ ] .",
    "three illbgs are so red that they are close to qualifying as extremely red objects ( ero ) ( @xmath16>4 $ ] , wilson et al .",
    "lbgs detected at 8@xmath5 m are redder than other galaxies ( @xmath18\\rangle = 1.95 $ ] versus 0.94 for lbgs detected at 3.6@xmath5 m but not 8@xmath5 m ) but not so red as the illbgs .",
    "all six lockman hole scuba sources have red @xmath16 $ ] colors @xcite , comparable to those of the illbgs .",
    "figure  2 compares the observed lbg colors with those predicted by two simple stellar population synthesis models ( single burst and constant star formation ) .",
    "these two models correspond to two extreme cases of a model having a exponentially decay star formation rate , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the single burst model and @xmath21 is the constant star formation model . for any given @xmath22",
    ", the constant star formation model predicts the reddest @xmath16 $ ] color for galaxies at @xmath23 .",
    "a combination of the two models with varying amounts of dust attenuation can reproduce almost all the lbg colors .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite argue that a model with constant star formation rate fits the seds of near - infrared bright lbgs better .",
    "this model should also be very close to the real star formation history for the 8@xmath5 m bright lbgs and illbgs . as shown in figure  2",
    ", @xmath24 is more sensitive to dust extinction , and @xmath16 $ ] is sensitive to both age and dust extinction for galaxies with constant star formation history .",
    "a rough estimate of the extinction range as @xmath25 is consistent with what @xcite and @xcite measured in their lbg samples .",
    "the lbgs with 8@xmath5 m detections tend to be older but little dustier than those not detected at 8 .",
    "the illbgs are more extreme , most very red in @xmath24 and @xmath16 $ ] , some beyond the model prediction .",
    "@xcite also found that the seds of lbgs with the reddest @xmath26 defied any simple model fitting and argued that those are starburst galaxies with multi - component morphologies , each with different colors .",
    "such a red color could also be due to a significant contribution from an obscured agn , but we argue below that significant agn emission is inconsistent with the @xmath27-[8.0]$ ] colors .",
    "the observed 24@xmath5 m emission ( @xmath286@xmath5 m rest wavelength ) from the illbgs can come from either the power law component of an agn ( e.g. , @xcite ) or from warm dust heated by a starburst ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for strong starbursts ,",
    "the 6.2@xmath5 m pah feature can enhance the observed flux by perhaps a factor of 1.5 @xcite .",
    "as @xcite point out , a key diagnostic for distinguishing between starbursts and agn is the existence of a change of slope around rest 34 : strong agn have nearly a constant slope from 2 to 10@xmath5 m , whereas starbursts show a distinct minimum in the 34  range . translated to an observational criterion , rest @xmath29 implies an agn ( @xcite ; cf .",
    "@xcite fig .",
    "figure  3 shows the @xmath30-[24]$ ] vs @xmath31 color - color diagram for starburst - agn separation suggested by @xcite .",
    "qsos and warm scuba sources exhibit rest - frame @xmath31 color as red as local agns @xcite , while all illbgs except one have @xmath32 .",
    "therefore we suggest that the 24@xmath5 m flux densities of illbgs are mainly due to strong dust emission caused by intensive star formation .",
    "illbgs have much redder @xmath30-[24]$ ] colors than qsos and agns , steeper than typical power - law seds but consistent with strong starbursts .",
    "the scuba sources occupy the same overall portion of color - color space in this plot as do illbgs , agns , and qsos at @xmath33 . in other words ,",
    "the cold scuba sources appear to be arp-220-like starburst galaxies at the upper - left corners , and the warm scuba sources are agns .",
    "we conclude that illbgs , like cold scuba sources , are starburst galaxies .",
    "the faint blue lbgs that lack 24@xmath5 m detections could have dust emission with flux densities below our detection threshold .",
    "for example , even blue dwarf galaxies are found to have dust emission at rest - frame 6@xmath5 m , presumably with pah features @xcite .",
    "we used a stacking technique to assess the average dust emission for the blue lbg population at z=3 .",
    "the lbgs without 24@xmath5 m detection were divided into two groups for stacking : those with 8@xmath5 m detections and those without .",
    "there are a total of 198 lbgs lacking 24@xmath5 m detections including both spectroscopically identified and unidentified ones . in this subset ,",
    "31 lbgs have 8@xmath5 m detections .",
    "the 8@xmath5 m and 24@xmath5 m images for both groups were stacked separately .",
    "the stacking results show a significant difference between lbgs with and without 8  detections .",
    "the lbgs without 8@xmath5 m detections have @xmath34 , right in the range exhibited by local dwarf galaxies as shown in figure  4 .",
    "the upper limit in the @xmath30-[24]$ ] colors is also consistent with colors of local blue dwarf galaxies .",
    "this strongly suggests that most faint blue lbgs in the sample have similar stellar masses , dust obscuration , and star - formation histories as dwarf galaxies in the local universe .",
    "the lbgs with 8@xmath5 m detections , including the illbgs , have @xmath35 , brighter than the local @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath37 and @xmath38-[24 ] \\rangle$ ] for the 8@xmath5m - detected lbgs are only slightly fainter and bluer than those of illbgs , suggesting that they may be similar kinds of galaxies but a little fainter and bluer , just below the 24@xmath5 m limiting flux density .",
    "all the results show that the lbg population is far from uniform .",
    "figures  1 and 4 demonstrate that the lbgs with the largest stellar luminosities , as indicated by 8@xmath5 m flux densities , are older and dustier than the lbgs with lower stellar luminosities . a larger lbg sample with infrared photometry and deeper 8  observations are needed to tell whether there are two distinct populations or a continuous range of galaxy properties .",
    "@xcite conducted a detailed analysis of the stellar populations and estimated stellar masses for the 8@xmath5m - selected lbgs .",
    "all were found to be massive galaxies(@xmath39 ) with the illbgs tending to have higher masses ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "these masses are consistent with the mean dynamic mass of @xmath41 for starburst - type scuba galaxies @xcite .",
    "massive galaxies with @xmath1 have also been found at @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "these observations challenge current theoretical predictions of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "this study provides further confirmation that at least some massive galaxies were formed by @xmath12 , favoring galaxy formation and evolution models assuming more rapid stellar mass accumulation scenarios @xcite .",
    "this infrared study of lbgs reveals that they are a diverse group in terms of both their masses and dust contents .",
    "the observed 8@xmath5 m ( rest 2 ) flux densities , which are roughly proportional to stellar mass , extend over at least 1.5 orders of magnitude , and the ratio of 24 to 8@xmath5 m flux densities , which measure the fraction of ism emission , extends over more than an order of magnitude .    among 253 lbgs in the egs area covered by spitzer ,",
    "5% were detected with @xmath43 .",
    "we refer to these as illbg .",
    "illbgs have much redder observed @xmath16 $ ] colors than the other lbgs in the sample .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath31 colors for most illbgs are stellar with no sign of an agn power - law component .",
    "therefore we suggest that the 24@xmath5 m emission is dominated by dust heated in a massive starburst , probably including some contribution from the pah feature at rest - frame 6.2@xmath5 m .",
    "illbgs and cold scuba sources share the same infrared properties , suggesting that they are closely related and may belong to the same population .",
    "if so , it ought to be possible to detect submillimeter emission from illbgs . both illbgs and cold scuba sources tend to be massive with a typical stellar mass of @xmath1 .",
    "such masses make them candidates for the progenitors of present - day giant ellipticals .",
    "in contrast to illbgs , most lbgs in the sample are only detected at 3.6 and 4.5@xmath5 m and have faint mid - infrared luminosities and blue @xmath16 $ ] colors .",
    "their lower average 8@xmath5 m flux density measured with the stacked image implies that the faint lbgs have much less stellar mass than illbgs , in a range similar to local dwarf galaxies .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath30-[24]$ ] color for average faint lbgs is also consistent with dust emission of local dwarf galaxies .",
