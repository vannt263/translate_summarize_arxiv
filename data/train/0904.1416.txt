    "fermion masses are one of the least understood parts of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "even the charged fermion masses span over five orders of magnitude from the top quark to the electron , begging for a theoretical explanation .",
    "the majority of these masses and mixing angles are precisely constrained by experiment .",
    "still , this wealth of data does not conclusively single out any theory of flavor .    in the near future , this may change dramatically with the discovery of new particles at the weak scale .",
    "new particles may only deepen the mystery , as would be the case if a fourth generation were discovered .",
    "on the other hand , the masses and mixings of the new particles may be governed by the same principles that determine the sm fermion masses . in this case , rather than extending the fermion sector , the new particles will shed light on the existing fermion spectrum .",
    "weak - scale supersymmetry provides examples of both possibilities . in pure gauge - mediated models , for example",
    ", squark and slepton masses are set by flavor - blind contributions , with no connection to the sm fermion masses .",
    "however , in gravity - mediated models and hybrid models with both gauge- and gravity - mediated contributions , squark and slepton masses may receive contributions that are governed by flavor symmetries that also determine the sm fermion masses  @xcite .",
    "the latter possibility leads to non - trivial flavor effects in high - energy experiments  @xcite , opening the possibility for real progress on the sm flavor problem at the large hadron collider , as has been emphasized recently by many authors ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    here",
    "we study the implications of flavor violation for the three - body decays of charged sleptons .",
    "such processes are most relevant for colliders in models with a gravitino lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and a slepton next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) , a generic possibility in models with both gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking  @xcite and gravity - mediated supersymmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "we consider a situation where the lightest particles are a gravitino lsp , several light sleptons , and the lightest neutralino , with the masses of each light slepton less than the mass of the lightest neutralino .",
    "this results in the typical two - body decays of these light sleptons being highly suppressed or kinematically inaccessible , leaving the three - body decays as the dominant decay modes . in these cases ,",
    "the three - body decays are also often the last visible step in cascade decays of squarks and gluinos , and so they impact nearly all supersymmetry searches and studies .",
    "three - body slepton decays have been studied previously in an important , flavor - conserving case , where the authors considered @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with the @xmath3 a mixture of left- and right - handed staus  @xcite .",
    "these decays are characterised by two distinct channels : a `` charge - preserving '' channel @xmath4 with opposite - sign leptons and a `` charge - flipping '' channel @xmath5 with same - sign leptons .",
    "flavor - conserving three - body decays of squarks have also been considered  @xcite , as have flavor - conserving three - body decays with sneutrinos as parent or daughter particles  @xcite .",
    "our work generalizes the charged slepton analysis to the case of arbitrary lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) and arbitrary left - right mixing . in the presence of general lfv , any three - body decay of @xmath6 has up to 9 possible charge - preserving modes @xmath7 and 6 possible charge - flipping modes @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , lfv and left - right mixing bring additional complications that are absent in the flavor - conserving case , including new processes mediated by higgs and @xmath10 bosons , new final states with neutrinos and quarks , and new interference effects in charge - flipping processes .",
    "these complications are well worth confronting , however , as there is a wealth of information in these branching ratios , which may shed light on the sm flavor problem .",
    "these decays , if present , are also relevant more broadly , for example , for supersymmetric searches and precision mass measurements . for example , in the flavor - conserving examples studied previously  @xcite , the final states necessarily contain @xmath11 leptons .",
    "since these decay with missing energy , they degrade searches based on energetic leptons , and they greatly reduce the prospects for precision mass measurements . with lfv , however , even if the lightest slepton is a stau , there may also be decay modes with two electrons , two muons , or an electron and a muon .",
    "even if these branching ratios are suppressed , they may be the more obvious signals at colliders , and they may also provide better opportunities for precision mass measurements .",
    "it is therefore of interest to know the size of these branching ratios , and what determines them .    in the following three sections , we begin with a general discussion of three - body decays and move gradually to more specific scenarios and concrete calculations . in sec .  [",
    "sec : diagrams ] we present the new final states and new feynman diagrams that are relevant to three - body decays once general flavor and left - right mixing are introduced . in sec .",

    "[ sec : plots ] we then show concrete results in two toy models with two - generation slepton mixing to illustrate our results . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we present our conclusions and explain how our results have been incorporated into spice , a publicly available computation package for generating supersymmetric spectra and branching ratios in scenarios with arbitrary slepton mixing .    we stress that , although we strive to give readers a intuitive feel for our results by considering concrete cases in the body of the paper , our analysis is valid for fully general lfv and left - right mixing .",
    "the complete , model - independent calculation is lengthy , but the full expressions for all three - body decay modes are given in a series of appendices .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , an important special case of three - body slepton decays has been discussed previously by ambrosanio , kribs , and martin  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : preserving ] and [ fig : flipping ] are then modified by the inclusion of @xmath23 mixing matrix factors at the interaction vertices .",
    "in addition , new diagrams contribute .",

    "[ fig : preserving ] .",
    "this decay requires neither flavor violation nor left - right mixing .",
    "there are also charge - preserving decays mediated by neutral higgs bosons and the @xmath10 boson , as shown in fig .",

    "the first is generated by left - right mixing terms in the lagrangian , and thus clearly requires left - right mixing to be non - zero .",
    "the other two come from @xmath36 terms , and in the absence of left - right mixing , they are flavor - diagonal in the separate @xmath37 and @xmath38 sectors , even with the presence of lfv in one or both .",
    "thus , in the absence of left - right mixing , the higgs coupling to sleptons is flavor - diagonal in the 6-dimensional space of left and right sleptons and does not contribute to three - body decays .",
    "similarly , the @xmath10 couples to the @xmath37 and @xmath38 sleptons separately , so in the absence of left - right mixing , its couplings are also flavor - diagonal .",
    "note , however , there are no photon - mediated diagrams at tree level , as the photon couples with equal strength to the left- and right - handed sleptons , and so its couplings are always flavor - diagonal . also note that in the case of non - zero left - right mixing but no flavor mixing , the @xmath28 and @xmath10 diagrams exist , but their contributions are only appreciable for certain mass orderings .",
    "namely , only when neither of the two mass eigenstates produced by left - right mixing posses kinematically allowed two - body decays will the three - body @xmath28 and @xmath10 contributions be relevant .",
    "the charge - flipping decay is unaffected by the higgs and @xmath10 boson diagrams , but in the presence of flavor violation , the fermions in the final state may be interchanged .",
    "this implies a new interference effect in the charge - flipping mode which is absent in the flavor - conserving case . in principle",
    ", there should also be a similar interference term in the neutrino decay modes if neutrinos possess majorana masses , but such a term is negligible in the limit of zero neutrino mass .    in summary , for charge - preserving",
    "decays to charged leptons of different generations , the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite may be straightforwardly modified to the general case .",
    "the only modification needed is the insertion of rotation matrices from flavor eigenstates to gauge interaction eigenstates . for",
    "charge - preserving decays to charged leptons of the same generation , however , the higgs and @xmath10 diagrams introduce new contributions to the decay width .",
    "there are also new charge - preserving decays to neutrinos , mediated by charginos and @xmath10 bosons , and to quarks , mediated by higgs and @xmath10 bosons .",
    "finally , in the case of the charge - flipping decays to like - sign leptons , the daughter leptons may be interchanged and thus the decay width must include an interference term between these two diagrams ; however , there are no higgs and @xmath10 contributions to this mode and so there are no further interference terms .",
    "given an understanding of the qualitatively new features introduced by flavor and left - right mixing described in sec .",

    "are typically dominant and sub - dominant , we first note that there is a suppression to the higgs and @xmath10 modes from left - right slepton mixing .",
    "in fact , the explicit higgs and @xmath10 couplings to sleptons depend on the left - right slepton mixing squared , @xmath57 in particular , for @xmath58 not significantly larger than the slepton mass , this is roughly the same order as yukawa suppression .",
    "we thus expect that , at the matrix element level , the higgs or @xmath10 radiated modes are generically suppressed by two powers of left - right mixing relative to the neutralino and chargino modes .",
    "second , to simplify phase space factors , we assume a typical amount of mass squared splitting @xmath59 ; we also neglect lepton masses when they are sub - dominant . under these assumptions ,",
    "the difference in propagator structure between the neutralino mode and that of the higgs and @xmath10 modes becomes apparent .",
    "the neutralino propagator is inversely proportional to @xmath60 , while the higgs ( @xmath10 ) propagator is inversely proportional to @xmath61 , which simply reduces to @xmath62 if the slepton masses are not too far above @xmath63 .",
    "thus , in models where the lightest neutralino and light slepton masses are close , the lightest neutralino pole contribution will be enhanced over the higgs and @xmath10 mass - suppressed contributions .",
    "conversely , as the slepton and neutralino mass scale grows , the higgs and @xmath10 contributions will drop off more slowly than the neutralino contribution .",
    "the three - body decays with two neutrinos or two quarks have much the same form as above with minor changes ( refer to the appendices for details ) .",
    "these changes are as follows : for the neutrino mode , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and the lepton masses are set to zero , hence simplifying the phase space calculation and removing the off - shell higgs contribution .",
    "for the quark modes , there is no off - shell fermion intermediary , and the higgs and @xmath10 modes are only modified with adjusted couplings and quark masses .",
    "the quark modes are , however , enhanced by the color factor and a sum over light flavors . because of these changes , however ,",
    "all of these modes are suppressed relative to the di - lepton mode by left - right mixing .",
    "the quark modes only have contributions from the higgs and @xmath10 diagrams , and thus are suppressed by left - right mixing as noted above . in the majority of models with a light slepton nlsp , the @xmath66 gauge eigenstates are generically lighter than the @xmath67 gauge eigenstates ; for such a model the neutrino modes are suppressed since the neutrino only couples to @xmath67 gauge eigenstates while the light sleptons are primarily @xmath66 states .",
    "indeed , in such a model @xmath68 so the neutrino and quark decay widths are all suppressed by @xmath69 relative to the dilepton modes .    finally , for the charge - flipping di - lepton decay , the matrix element is given by @xmath70 where the negative sign comes from fermi statistics .",
    "the decay width is then @xmath71 with @xmath72,\\ ] ] and @xmath73 is a phase space factor which has a value of 1 for two outgoing leptons of different flavor and 1/2 for two outgoing leptons of the same flavor due to indistinguishable particle statistics . @xmath74 and",
    "@xmath75 both have the same basic form as the result from @xcite , where the only change is the insertion of flavor - mixing coefficients and , for @xmath75 , interchange of @xmath76 and @xmath77 between the two terms ; the new @xmath78 is presented in appendix  [ app : gamma21 ] .",
    "we find that this charge - flipping decay width is of the same order of magnitude as the charge - preserving di - lepton mode , though the flavor structure is markedly different : this is discussed in the next section .",
    "to validate our results and investigate their phenomenological implications , we examine some simple cases of two - slepton mixing . in these examples we consider spectra with fairly degenerate sleptons and lightest neutralino .",
    "the slepton - neutralino degeneracy is motivated by simple gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking scenarios with not too many messengers .",
    "larger splittings are , of course , possible if there are many messengers or in other frameworks , such as minimal supergravity .",
    "the sleptons are taken fairly degenerate so that large mixing angles are consistent with low energy constraints and so may be considered .",
    "we note , however , that these examples are merely illustrative , and our results are valid in any chosen framework with arbitrary mass splittings .",
    "first , we consider @xmath79 mixing parameterized by @xmath80 fig .",

    "[ fig : smuse ] , which shows the decay widths for the charge - preserving channel , demonstrates the typical structure of two - slepton mixing : all decay widths are at most @xmath85 periodic , the sleptons interchange roles ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) at @xmath88 , the @xmath89 and @xmath90 modes are equal at all mixing angles , and at @xmath91 all decay widths are equal . in contrast , the right plot in fig .  [",
    "fig : smuse ] , which shows the charge - flipping channel , demonstrates a different flavor structure .",

    "in addition , note that the @xmath93 mode drops to zero at @xmath91 , because the charge - flipping mode has two diagrams at tree level which cancel at @xmath91 for the @xmath93 mode .",

    "<S> we determine the widths of three - body decays of sleptons , @xmath0 , in the presence of arbitrary slepton flavor violation and left - right mixing . </S>",
    "<S> these decays are important in scenarios in which the lightest supersymmetric particle is the gravitino , a generic possibility in models with gauge- and gravity - mediated supersymmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> three - body decays have been discussed previously assuming flavor conservation and left - right mixing in only the stau sector . flavor violation and general left - right mixing open up many new decay channels , which provide new avenues for precision mass measurements and may play an essential role in solving the standard model flavor problem . </S>",
    "<S> we present results for toy models with two - generation mixing , and discuss the implementation of these results in spice , a program that simplifies collider event simulations of flavor - violating supersymmetric models . </S>"
