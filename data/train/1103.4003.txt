    "we start the introduction by considering the following views of great men : @xmath0``although nobody is in doubt today of the validity of the remarkable interpretation of thermodynamics with which statistical mechanics , following the efforts of boltzmann and gibbs , has recently provided us , it still remains extremely difficult to give a completely accurate justification for it ''    -louis de broglie@xcite .",
    "@xmath0``the problem [ defining the ensemble distribution depending upon the external conditions imposed on a system ] was solved by gibbs , although a rigorous justification of the distributions obtained is a complicated problem that is still not completely solved at the present time .",
    "it is not even clear to what extent this rigorous justification is possible ''    -d .",
    "n. zubarev@xcite .",
    "@xmath0``there is probably no other well - established field of theoretical physical science that is as much plagued by paradox and criticism of its fundamental logic as is statistical mechanics ''    -joseph edward mayer and maria goeppert mayer@xcite    @xmath0    `` if we are describing only a state of knowledge about a single system , then clearly there can be nothing physically real about frequencies in the ensemble ; and it makes no sense to ask , ' ' which ensemble is the correct one ? `` ... gibbs understood this clearly ; and that , i suggest , is the reason why he does not say a word about ergodic theorems , ... ''     e. t. jaynes@xcite    @xmath0    there is lot of confusion regarding ergodic hypothesis in the literature ( regarding whether it is necessary for statistical mechanics or not ) and in the usual discussions of people . also the reasons how and why statistical mechanics works are not properly understood .",
    "the problem appears complicated as one has to take into consideration various ingredients of vary different nature ( from the character of experimental measurements , large number of degrees of freedom , and the microscopic dynamical properties ) involved in the statistical approach for dynamical systems . in the present review we try to dis - entangle various ingredients and present the resolution of the ergodic problem in a simpler and clear way .",
    "a detailed study of literature shows that there are mainly three camps at the foundations of statistical mechanics ( 1 ) ergodic school , ( 2 ) non - ergodic school , and ( 3 ) quantum foundations of statistical mechanics .",
    "we critically analyse all the three approaches to reach on a broader understanding of the foundations of statistical mechanics or we attempt to see the `` complete picture '' .",
    "aim of the present review is to show that ergodicity is not relevant for equilibrium statistical mechanics of macroscopic systems ( with tolman and landau ) .",
    "we will see that the solution of the problem is in the very peculiar nature of the macroscopic observables ( they are sum functions ) and with the very large number of the degrees of freedom involved as first pointed out by khinchin .",
    "similar arguments are used by landau based upon the approximate property of `` statistical independence '' .",
    "we critically review these ideas .",
    "we also review the role of chaos ( classical and quantum ) in the foundations of statistical mechanics , i.e. , where it is important and where it is not important . for students and beginners",
    "the purpose of the article is best served if they first understand the first chapter of landau - lifshitz s book on statistical physics and read the little book of khinchin on the mathematical foundations of statistical mechanics .",
    "_ again our motivation is to have a broader view of the subject and a pedagogical presentation . _    in the present section we present a brief summary of the essential topics in the form of questions and answers . in section",
    "ii we review the ergodic approach to the foundations of statistical mechanics by dividing it into further subsections . first defining the ergodic problem and then giving a historical account of how the ergodic problem came up with the works of maxwell and boltzmann . in subsection",
    "ii(c ) the reformulation of the ergodic problem by birkhoff is given and the resolution of the ergodic problem by khinchin is given in subsection d. the role of chaos , integrability , and non - integrability is discussed in subsection e.    in section iii we present the non - ergodic approach .",
    "this section consists of two subsections one on landau - lifshitz s approach and another on e. t. jaynes approach with a critique .",
    "we also advance the plausibility arguments for equal - a - priori probability hypothesis .",
    "the last section is devoted to the quantum foundations of statistical mechanics . in this",
    "we review the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis , the quantum ergodic theory of von neumann , and other recent quantum - statistical typicality approaches .",
    "we will see that von neumann s quantum ergodic theorem is a general statement applicable to systems with many degrees of freedom and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis is a consequence of quantum chaos , other approaches falling under typicality properties are also analyzed .",
    "the issue of compatibility of microscopic time reversibility and macroscopic time irreversibility is not considered here .",
    "this has been clarified in detail in the beautiful papers of jeol lebowitz@xcite(for irreversibility in quasi - isolated systems see@xcite ) .      in their famous book@xcite lev",
    "landau wrote : `` in the discussion of the foundations of statistical physics , we consider from the start the distribution of small subsystems ...... this allows the complete avoidance of ergodic or similar hypotheses , which are in fact not essential as regard to these aims [ i.e. , the foundations of physical statistics ] '' @xmath0    as we know from the most used prescription of gibbs we calculate the phase space averages of dynamical quantities using appropriate ensembles and we find that these phase averages agree very well with experiments .",
    "clearly actual experiments are not done on a hypothetical ensemble they are done on the actual system in the laboratory and these experiments take a finite amount of time . thus it is usually argued that actual measurements are time averages and they are equal to phase averages due to ergodicity ,    @xmath1    now we will give the following reasons against ergodicity .",
    "\\(1 ) if one assumes that during the measurement time the system samples all the microstates and @xmath2 limit of equation ( 1 ) is reached during the measurement time , then ones assumption is wrong .",
    "it is a well know fact that time taken by the system to sample all the available phase is fantastically large ( more than the age of the universe ) .",
    "for example@xcite , if we consider a nanoparticle with @xmath3 nuclei each with spin half and consider only the nuclear spin system .",
    "the total number of quantum state are @xmath4 .",
    "consider that these spins continuously flip from up spin to down spin and vice versa and this spin flipping is caused by phonons from the system and bath in which the nanoparicle is present .",
    "at room temperature this frequency is about @xmath5 cycles per second .",
    "let us assume that each spin makes a transition during this period .",
    "thus the total number of transitions per second is @xmath6 .",
    "the time taken by the system to go over all the states is @xmath7 , and the age of universe is @xmath8 . _ thus clearly during the laboratory measurement time the full ensemble is not realized , and only a very tiny fraction of the total number of the members of the ensemble is realized . _ note that the time scale diverges nearly exponentially with the number of atoms in the sample .",
    "\\(2 ) if one accepts ergodic hypothesis ( and do not accept explanation ( 1 ) ) , that the laboratory measurements are time averages ( measurement time scale being much large as compared to microscopic dynamical time scale ( time taken to flip a spin @xmath9 ) , then one accepts equation ( 1 ) and accepts @xmath2 ) , then time average value of an observable ( or a result of measurement ) in a series of experiments ( repeating the same experiment again and again ) on the same system will agree with ensemble average .",
    "this is in fundamental contradiction with what we observe i.e. thermodynamical measurements are not strictly reproducible@xcite .",
    "fluctuations in thermodynamic measurements are the unavoidable consequence of our lack of control of microscopic dynamics and thus our lack of control of the initial micro - condition at the start of the measurement .",
    "the above discussion against ergodicity opens the question `` but how does statistical mechanics work ? '' and the theory has been so successful . the answer is :    in statistical mechanics we concern with macroscopic systems and with macroscopic observables which are very special ones .",
    "special in the sense that they are `` sum functions '' i.e. , their value for the whole system is equal to the sum of equivalent functions for the small parts of the body ( for example , energy of the whole system is equal to the sum of energies of the small parts of the body ) . due to the property called `` statistical independence '' of small parts of the body ,",
    "the sum functions take almost constant value on the energy hypersurface ( details are given in section ii(d ) ) .",
    "@xmath0the microscopic time taken by the measurement produces that `` same '' value .",
    "thus equality of time average and phase space average is imposed due to the fact of `` temporal constancy of special macroscopic observables in equilibrium '' .",
    "the magnitude of fluctuations goes as @xmath10 .",
    "thus these are very small for macroscopic systems .    put differently , for an extremely large number micro - states ( called typical micro - states ) the macro - state of the system",
    "is the same . only very exceptional micro - states ( `` bad states '' with fantastically small probability )",
    "give non - typical behaviour .",
    "to explain these lines let us consider a macroscopic system and measure an observable .",
    "repeat the experiment many many times , each time the starting micro - state is different but important point is that each time we get approximately the same value for the observable ( since huge number of micro - states are equilibrium micro - states ) .",
    "it is extremely rare that we get a value during a measurement which is very different from the value in other measurements .",
    "this `` typicality '' is at the heart of why statistical mechanics explain thermodynamic behaviour . here",
    "the probability theory inters into statistical description .",
    "the typicality explains its high predictability for macroscopic systems ( even though statistical mechanics has probabilistic basis ) .",
    "as the macro - observables are extremely insensitive to micro - condition and microscopic dynamics , the role of microscopic dynamics is very insignificant in equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "see section ii .",
    "d. for a detailed explanation , and the role of fermi - pasta - ulam problem in this connection ( section ii .",
    "also it is good idea to abandon 19th century philosophy of explaining everything we see around with microscopic dynamics called `` reductionism '' .",
    "boltzmann initially tried to explain 2nd law of thermodynamics with microscopic molecular dynamics but later on realized the need of of statistical laws .",
    "at each level of complexity new laws emerge not explainable `` purely '' by shroedinger equation@xcite .",
    "in standard practice , for example for a system of volume @xmath11 with @xmath12 particles in equilibrium with very large heat bath at temperature @xmath13 , one use s gibbs canonical ensemble    @xmath14    here @xmath15 is the probability to find the system in the infinitesimal phase volume @xmath16 around the phase point @xmath17 [ @xmath18 for a system of @xmath19 degrees of freedom ] .",
    "@xmath20 with @xmath21 called boltzmann constant .",
    "the negative logarithm of partition function @xmath22 is proportional to the free energy of the system    @xmath23    from the free energy and its derivatives all the needed information is extracted .",
    "each time we get the gibbs ensemble averaging , for example , pressure is given as    @xmath24    with hamiltonian @xmath25 as a function of the volume @xmath11 ( through potential function with boundaries etc . ) .",
    "thus our computational algorithm involves phase space averaging .",
    "but the actual experiments are done on the given system in the laboratory ( not on the hypothetical ensemble ) .",
    "measurements during the experimentation take finite amount of time and thus what we measure in laboratory is the time averages not the ensemble averages .",
    "so the immediate question arises how to justify the replacement of time averages with ensemble average .",
    "this is called the ergodic problem .",
    "there is a considerable confusion regarding the precise meaning of ergodic hypothesis .",
    "thus we will present a brief historical account about the origin and its mis - interpretations by ehrenfests@xcite . in this analysis",
    "we will better understand the ergodic program for justifying statistical mechanics .",
    "boltzmann s first attempt to reduce the second law of thermodynamics to a theorem in mechanics appeared in 1866 and his last papers in columns of nature in 1890s regarding his debates on irreversibility . during his scientific career ( 1866 - 1895 )",
    "boltzmann tried to understand the kinetic theory of gases and thermodynamics with many different approaches based on atomic constitution of matter .",
    "favouring one approach at one time and then rejecting it for the another and then returning back again to the previous one .",
    "this is a very distinctive character of boltzmann@xcite .",
    "roughly , from 1866 - 1871 he was interested in deriving second law of thermodynamics purely from mechanics ( in his 1866 paper no probabilistic argument is present ) , in 1867 he reads maxwell s work and his subsequent papers from 1868 to 1871 uses probabilistic notions after maxwell s velocity distribution function . in these papers",
    "he extends maxwell s results to a gas in an external potential ( maxwell - boltzmann law ) . in the paper@xcite of 1868",
    "he first introduces his ergodic hypothesis .",
    "he was considering an isolated gas in an arbitrary initial state ( see ehrenfests@xcite ) , then he argues  based on the empirical fact that systems tend to equilibrium and permanently stay there  that average behaviour over a long time interval will the thermal equilibrium behaviour ( note that this long before his h - theorem ) . according to ehrenfests here he introduces the concept of ensembles ( much before gibbs ) . in justifying the equivalence of ensemble averages and temporal averages he introduces a hypothesis ( note that he do not use the word ergodic at this point",
    ", word ergoden appears much later in his 1884 paper in a different context ) .",
    "thus the present day terminology is largely due to ehrenfests .",
    "note also that this is the birth of modern statistical mechanics .",
    "the older treatments in which statistical aspects are related to single molecules are called ( by ehrenfests ) the `` kineto - statistics of the molecule '' and the 1868 paper treats gas model as a whole and ehrenfests call it `` kineto - statistics of the gas model '' .    important point to be noted here is that the version of ergodic hypothesis which is attributed to boltzmann is stronger than what the founding father has thought :    `` the great irregularity of the thermal motion , and the multiplicity of forces that act on the the body from outside , make it probable that the atoms themselves , by virtue of motion that we call heat , pass through all possible positions and velocities consistent with the equation of kinetic energy , and that we can therefore apply the equations previously developed to the coordinates and velocities of the atoms of warm bodies ''    now the present strong form ( trajectory passing through each and every point of the energy surface for an isolated system ) of ergodic hypothesis can not be attributed to boltzmann , it is the mis - interpretation on the ehrenfests side .",
    "the representative phase point of the system passing through every point of the phase space is impossible .",
    "in fact later in 1913 the impossibility of ergodic systems ( stronger form ) was proved by independently by rosenthal and pancherel on measure - theoretic arguments .",
    "ehrenfests after mis - interpreting the boltzmann ergodic hypothesis proposed some what weaker form and they called it the quasi - ergodic hypothesis , which meant that the trajectory of phase point covers the energy surface densely even though not actually passing through every point of it .",
    "an excellent discussion of this mis - interpretation is given in the work of s. g. brush@xcite .",
    "in the period 1872 - 1878 he wrote two most important papers of his life , the 1872 paper contains what we now call `` boltzmann equation '' and h - theorem .",
    "here he claimed that his h - theorem provided the desired theorem from mechanics to explain irreversibility and second law of thermodynamics .",
    "this came under a serious objection due to loschmidt in 1876 who insisted on the incompatibility of the time - asymmetric behaviour ( shown by h - theorem ) and the time - symmetric behaviour of microscopic equations of motion ( these debates are now well understood and documented@xcite ) . as a result boltzmann rethought the basis of his approach and presented a very different approach in 1877 what we now call permutational argument and his famous result @xmath26 ( see appendix a ) written in modern form by max planck .",
    "equilibrium is now conceived as most probable macro - state instead of stationary macro - state ( in time ) .",
    "it is highly probable for a system initially in a non - equilibrium state to move towards equilibrium state ( real space density distribution in accord with external conditions(potentials ) and maxwellian velocity distribution ) as the phase space volume of the equilibrium macro - state is fantastically large as compared to non - equilibrium state .",
    "thus the equilibrium is most probable state but arbitrary deviations from it are also probable , but it turns out that the probability is fantastically small .",
    "this originates the notions of typicality .",
    "third period , in 1880s he left the `` purely '' probabilistic approach and again went back to his mechanical explanation of the laws thermodynamics ( we see here that boltzmann did not stick to one approach ) .",
    "he wrote an important paper in 1884 largely forgotten by now ( see the review by gallavotti@xcite ) .",
    "this paper is a generalization of a paper by helmholtz on the mechanical models of thermodynamics based on monocyclic systems .",
    "boltzmann proves a theorem called heat theorem , i.e. , @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath13 is the time average of the kinetic energy @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the total energy , and @xmath30 the potential energy which depend on an experimentally controllable parameter @xmath11 .",
    "the motivation here was to find mechanical analogues of thermodynamic entropy .",
    "result was proved for monocyclic systems by helmholtz and boltzmann generalize this for high dimensional systems under the assumption of ergodicity ( note that this is the second time he introduces ergodic considerations ) . in his discrete world - view",
    "he imagined the phase trajectory visiting all the discrete cells of the phase space . with the introduction of some stationary phase space distribution ( he calls it `` monode '' )",
    ", the calculation of difficult time averages can be replaced with much simpler phase averages .",
    "he considers an ensemble of systems in exactly same macroscopic conditions and a family of stationary distributions which he calls `` monode '' ( note that this the introduction of ensembles much before gibbs ) . a monode which verifies the heat theorem is called by him the `` orthode '' . here",
    "( first time ) he considers two orthodes ( 1 ) ergode ( @xmath31 microcanonical ensemble ) and ( 2 ) holode ( @xmath32 canonical ensemble ) , see fig 1 .    as we have seen in section i(a ) , in real thermodynamic measurements we do not have infinite time averages , and thus we are not justified in equating the finite time averages with infinite time averages and then using the ergodic hypothesis ( which has never been proved in generality ) .",
    "the answer to this was already clear to boltzmann .",
    "the answer lies in the peculiarities of the thermodynamic observables and the large number of degrees of freedom involved .",
    "we will discuss this in section ii(d ) .",
    "we also note that the original ergodic hypothesis as envisaged by boltzmann was a weaker statement as compared to modern version of that .",
    "ehrenfests 1911 encyclopedia article@xcite generated lot of interest about ergodic systems in the community of mathematicians ( paul ehrenfest was the student of boltzmann ) . @xmath0if one is able to prove the ergodic hypothesis for a given system i.e. , @xmath33 , then    42    one eliminates the necessity of determining initial state of the system and of solving hamilton s equations .",
    "one justifies the dynamical foundation of statistical mechanics .",
    "clearly , then statistical mechanics reduces to a branch of mechanics .",
    "but story is not so simple .",
    "it is a very difficult problem . in 1931",
    ", g. d. brikhoff@xcite reduced the ergodic property of a dynamical system to an equivalent property called `` metric transitivity '' .",
    "he proves the following theorems :    45    @xmath34 exists for almost every @xmath35 .",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition for the system to be ergodic is that the phase space be metrically transitive .",
    "a system is `` metrically in - transitive ''",
    "iff there exists regions @xmath36 and @xmath37 of phase space such that @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which are invariant under the system s dynamics : @xmath40 and @xmath41 for all @xmath42 .    in simple words phase point",
    "wanders all the available phase space if and only if the system is metrically transitive .",
    "@xmath0this property again can not be experimentally verifiable .",
    "thus the implications of brikhoff s theorems for physical statistical mechanics are inconclusive .",
    "@xmath0but luckily or unluckily , we have seen that ergodicity is not required for doing statistical mechanics of macroscopic systems .",
    "khinchin@xcite(see also the 4th chapter of the book@xcite ) approached the ergodic problem from physical point of view .",
    "he pointed out the importance of the following points    1 .   in statistical mechanical systems of interest",
    "the number of the degrees of freedom is very large .",
    "2 .   in statistical mechanical systems",
    "the observables of interest are very special ones they are `` sum functions '' ( @xmath43 ) .    with these considerations he proves the following two theorems : @xmath0theorem ( 1 ) :",
    "consider a physical quantity @xmath44 pertaining to a single molecule and define phase coefficient of correlation : @xmath45 . if @xmath46 for @xmath47 the function @xmath48 is ergodic ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the physical assumption that goes into this theorem is : `` because of the fact that the given system consists of a very large number of molecules it is natural to expect that knowledge of the state of a single molecule at a certain moment does not permit us to predict anything ( or almost anything ) about the state in which this molecule will be found after a sufficiently long time '' khinchin .",
    "@xmath50this is equivalent to the idea of molecular chaos .",
    "next he proves a much more relevant result ( to physical statistics):@xmath50theorem ( 2)@xcite : @xmath51 here @xmath52 is the actual value of the observable ( no time averaging ! ) pertaining to the whole system , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are @xmath55 .",
    "he proves that the correlation co - efficient between phase functions is actually very small for large @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath0this implies that the physically relevant observable are self averaging !",
    "the above statement is the resolution of the whole problem _ ( for macroscopic systems and sum - function observables ) . _",
    "as far as one is concerned with macroscopic systems ( large @xmath12 ) and sum function observables chaos , integrability , and non - integrability does not play any role in the foundations of statistical mechanics . as usual statistical mechanical systems in the laboratory",
    "are never isolated , the molecular chaos assumption of khinchin seems to be true and the consequences are clear to us .    but for `` isolated '' low dimensional systems and non - sum - function observables the case is not so simple . before 1955",
    "there was a general consensus that weak extraneous interactions makes the statistical mechanical systems ergodic ( phase point wandering the whole of phase space ) .    in 1955 ,",
    "fermi and his collaborators did a numerical experiment on a chain of non - linearly coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "their expectation was that the small non - linear coupling will make the system ergodic ( energy stored initially in one of the normal modes will go over in time to all other modes ) .",
    "but the result was quite surprising .",
    "consider the hamiltonain of the system as @xmath56 .",
    "for @xmath57 system is completely integrable and the energy @xmath58 of each normal mode @xmath59 is conserved .",
    "it was expected that when @xmath60 energy stored initially in one normal mode will `` spread '' to all other modes .",
    "but this did not happen , the energy periodically comes back to the original mode showing no sign of equipartition of energy .",
    "this `` paradox '' can be explained with kam theorem . which states that",
    "if @xmath61 is small enough then on the constant energy surface , invariant tori survive in a region whose measure tends to @xmath62 as @xmath63 .",
    "there is a threshold @xmath64 called kam threshold , if ( 1 ) @xmath65 kam tori play a major role and system does not follow equipartition , and ( 2 ) if @xmath66 then kam tori has a minor role and equipartition happens .      in 1987 , livi , pettini , ruffo , and vulpiani published an important paper@xcite on the relevance of chaos regarding the predictions of canonical ensemble .",
    "they divided the chain into coupled subsystems containing large number of particles ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "let @xmath67 is the per particle time averaged energy of the subsystem @xmath68 and @xmath69 it s heat capacity @xmath70 .",
    "it was found that the time averages limit ( private communication with roberto livi ) ] agrees well with the predictions of the canonical ensemble , even though the system was having the kam tori .",
    "however the story is not so simple .",
    "they also considered another model of coupled rotators in which only @xmath67 showed canonical behaviour not @xmath69 as the integrability - to- non - integrability parameter was changed ( see for details chapter 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "note also that @xmath69 is not a sum function .",
    "thus one can loosely say that _",
    "`` more coarse your observables , less you depend on chaos '' . _",
    "as expressed at the beginning of section i ( a ) , lev landau did not believe in the need of ergodic or similar hypotheses in justifying the foundations of statistical mechanics@xcite . from the beginning they consider a system always present in a bath , i.e. , subsystem in a given system which is in itself present in bigger system ( as in nature no system is ideally isolated ) .",
    "they argue that the extreme complexity of the interactions of the system with the surrounding bodies makes the system s phase point to wander in the phase space .",
    "let in a sufficiently long interval of time @xmath13 the phase point spends @xmath71 amount of time in a given volume @xmath72 of the phase space , then ,    @xmath73    is the probability that , if the system is observed at any arbitrary time , its phase point will be found in the volume @xmath72 .",
    "going to the infinitesimals @xmath74 . here",
    "@xmath75 is the density of that temporal probability distribution , i.e. , @xmath76 is the probability to find the system , observed at any time , in the infinitesimal phase volume @xmath16 .",
    "the important point to be noted here is that we have `` only one '' system under consideration ( no statistical ensemble is considered at this point ) .",
    "the distribution defined @xmath75 is a temporal distribution for that system .    with the introduction of statistical distribution function",
    "one can calculate the mean value of any dynamical quantity @xmath77 as @xmath78 it is obvious by the definition ( 6 ) of probability that the statistical averaging ( equation ( 7 ) ) is exactly equivalent to the infinite time averaging    @xmath79    thus avoiding any ergodic hypothesis , as there is no ad - hoc introduction of any probability distribution .",
    "the @xmath75 is the actual probability distribution in the system s phase space from its temporal behaviour .",
    "but it is non - trivial to prove that    @xmath80    this has never been proved in generality ( it turns out that this is a very difficult problem for a system with large number of degrees of freedom ) .",
    "we will see from landau s argument and with the assumption of `` statistical independence '' that @xmath81 when number of degrees of freedom involved becomes very large .",
    "then they argue@xcite that predictions of statistical mechanics are very reliable due to the fact that the relevant observables take almost constant value on the energy surface .",
    "they also consider `` sum '' functions @xmath82 .",
    "their considerations are based on a very general fact of `` statistical independence '' of various parts ( pertain to subsystems ) of the macroscopic observables ( it is not true for long range interacting systems ) . on `` statistical independence '' they prove : @xmath83 .",
    "one can say @xmath0@xmath84      1 .",
    "the distribution function of two sub - systems is equal to the product of individual sub - systems functions ( statistical independence ) , i.e. , @xmath85 ( for simplicity of notation here @xmath86 ) .",
    "thus log of the distribution function is an additive integral - of - motion .",
    "3 .   due to liouville s theorem ( hamiltonian dynamics )",
    "distribution function is an integral - of - motion ( temporal invariance of the phase space distribution of an ensemble ) .",
    "we have only seven independent additive integrals of motion @xmath88 , and @xmath89(from mechanics ) .",
    "@xmath90 6 .",
    "from which canonical ensemble ensues @xmath91 , say , for a system in a box .",
    "the important point to be noted is that there are @xmath92 other integrals of motion ( excluding the additive ones , i.e. , energy , three components of linear and three components of angular momentum ) .",
    "these remaining integrals of motion are not additive thus they do not play any role in the landau s argument .",
    "thus we see in lev landau s program for the foundations of statistical mechanics , if one starts from the beginning with a system present in a bigger system and one assumes the property of statistical independence and take note of the additive integrals of motion then one can reach the canonical distribution and no ergodic hypothesis is required as we have not constructed any ensemble .",
    "we observe that the property of statistical independence is equivalent to the hypothesis of equal - a - priori probabilities .",
    "we give two reasons :    reason ( 1 ) : there are two views at the foundations of statistical mechanics ( 1 ) is based on the principle of equal - a - priori probabilities ( kubo s book , tolman s etc ) and the ( 2 ) is based on quasi - closed subsystems and the additive integrals of motion ( due to l. d. landau , see their book ) .",
    "if one analyze them carefully one sees that both view - points are consistent with each other , first one comes from the second .",
    "the principle of equal - a - priori probability is just a consequence of the fact that there are mechanical invariants of motion proportional to log of the distribution function for a quasi - closed subsystem @xmath93 ( due to statistical independence ) , which is another integral of motion due to liouville s theorem , thus one has @xmath94 .",
    "the right hand side of this equation is the content of dynamics ( conservation laws ) .",
    "the left hand side consists of a more subtle quantity related to statistical properties and a consequence of the theorem of dynamics and the property of statistical independence . since @xmath95 is constant no matter where is phase point is in the available phase space .",

    "<S> as the title says we want to answer the question ; how and why does statistical mechanics work ? as we know from the most used prescription of gibbs </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the phase space averages of dynamical quantities and we find that these phase averages agree very well with experiments . clearly actual experiments are not done on a hypothetical ensemble they are done on the actual system in the laboratory and these experiments take a finite amount of time . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is usually argued that actual measurements are time averages and they are equal to phase averages due to ergodicity . </S>",
    "<S> aim of the present review is to show that ergodicity is not relevant for equilibrium statistical mechanics ( with tolman and landau ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will see that the solution of the problem is in the very peculiar nature of the macroscopic observables and with the very large number of the degrees of freedom involved in macroscopic systems as first pointed out by khinchin . </S>",
    "<S> similar arguments are used by landau based upon the approximate property of `` statistical independence '' . </S>",
    "<S> we review these ideas in detail and in some cases present a critique . </S>",
    "<S> we review the role of chaos ( classical and quantum ) where it is important and where it is not important . </S>",
    "<S> we criticise the ideas of e. t. jaynes who says that the ergodic problem is conceptual one and is related to the very concept of ensemble itself which is a by - product of frequency theory of probability , and the ergodic problem becomes irrelevant when the probabilities of various micro - states are interpreted with laplace - bernoulli theory of probability ( bayesian viewpoint ) .    in the end </S>",
    "<S> we critically review various quantum approaches ( quantum - statistical typicality approaches ) to the foundations of statistical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> the literature on quantum - statistical typicality is organized under four notions ( 1 ) kinematical canonical typicality , ( 2 ) dynamical canonical typicality , ( 3 ) kinematical normal typicality , and ( 4 ) dynamical normal typicality . </S>",
