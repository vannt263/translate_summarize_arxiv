    "since berry s pioneering work @xcite geometric phases , i.e. contributions to a quantum system s phase which depend only on the geometry of the path traversed by the system in its parameter space , have been the focus of intense theoretical and experimental research .",
    "the majority of the theoretical works discuss various generalizations of berry s original paper , see e.g. @xcite and for a very early work @xcite , and investigate the appearance of geometric phases in systems with complex eigenfunctions , as e.g. open or dissipative systems @xcite .",
    "most experimental works observe geometric phases by tracing the pattern of nodal lines of a wavefunction during adiabatic and cyclic processes @xcite , a technique suggested originally by berry and wilkinson @xcite .",
    "the dissipative nature of a system is commonly suppressed or neglected in experiments ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this was not the case in the recently reported observation of a so - called exceptional point ( ep ) in a microwave cavity experiment @xcite .",
    "such an ep , i.e. the coalescence of two levels of a quantum system , occurs only in dissipative systems , where it is associated with crossings and avoided crossings of the eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "one of the key features of an ep is the appearance of a geometric phase @xcite when it is encircled in parameter space .",
    "if the ep is isolated , in its vicinity the dynamics is predominantly determined by the two states corresponding to the resonances , which coalesce at the ep . there",
    ", our system may be modelled by a two - dimensional non - hermitian , symmetric matrix .",
    "such systems have been analyzed in @xcite and in @xcite , where one can find a complete and very detailed treatise on the essential features of the eigenvalues and -vectors of parameter dependent two - dimensional matrices associated with the singularities .    for two - state systems described by a complex symmetric hamiltonian , the geometric phase associated with an ep @xcite differs from that associated with a diabolic point ( dp ) @xcite , a simple degeneracy between two levels . the only way to determine a geometric phase with our experimental setup @xcite is by recording the change of the pattern of nodal lines when encircling an ep in parameter space . in our microwave cavity experiments",
    "we can only measure the intensity distribution of the electric field , that is , the absolute value of the complex eigenfunctions . however , a premise for the mere existence of a pattern of nodal lines is , that the eigenfunctions remain real throughout the cyclic process .",
    "accordingly , the question arises , whether berry s reconstruction technique can be applied to the complex eigenfunctions of the dissipative microwave resonator discussed in @xcite .    in the present work we first focus on a parametric two - state model adequate for the simulation of our experiment with the dissipative microwave cavity . in doing so , we restrict ourselves to the analysis of those properties of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors , which are observable using our experimental setup",
    ". for more detailed information one might consult @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we calculate the geometric phase that occurs when an ep is encircled . moreover",
    ", we show that for this model a path around the ep exists along which the eigenvectors are approximately real , that is , have an imaginary part being negligible compared to its real part .",
    "indeed , as is explained in more detail below , from the mere fact , that we observe nodal lines rather than nodal points in our experiment we may already conclude , that along the path chosen in our experiment the eigenfunctions have exactly this property .",
    "this then allows us to employ berry s reconstruction technique in a microwave cavity experiment , where the development of the nodal line patterns with the parameters is studied .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : using a two - state model adequate for the simulation of our experiment we analytically calculate in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] the geometric phases that occur when an ep is encircled . by this calculation a path around the ep",
    "is defined , along which the eigenvectors of the system remain approximately real . in sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] the actual microwave cavity experiment is discussed . using the same experimental techniques and a setup similar to the one discussed in @xcite , we here present data from the encircling of a different ep . from the transformation properties of the eigenfunctions and from the existence of a nodal line pattern for every setting of the cavity s parameters we conclude that the eigenfunctions remain approximately real in the experiment while the ep is encircled .",
    "a conclusion is given in sect .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "in this section , we analyze the behavior of the eigenvectors of a two - state quantum system when encircling an ep .",
    "as outlined in @xcite , the two - state hamiltonian appropriate for the simulation of our system in the vicinity of an isolated ep is written in terms of a two - dimensional complex symmetric matrix . accordingly , in the sequel we restrict ourselves to such two - state systems .",
    "in particular , we show that a closed path exists along which the eigenvectors are approximately real and that in accordance with @xcite one needs four turns around the ep in order to restore the original situation .",
    "we use the same notation as in @xcite and write the hamiltonian of the two - state system in the form @xmath0 here , the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 are real and @xmath3 may be complex . expression ( [ hammod ] ) is a complex symmetric hamiltonian . by defining @xmath4 and @xmath5 the eigenvalues , @xmath1 , of @xmath6 can be written as @xmath7 two - state systems described by such a hamiltonian have been studied both analytically and numerically in @xcite . moreover , subtracting @xmath8 from the diagonal elements of @xmath6 given in @xcite and performing a transformation of the type defined in equation ( 3.6 ) of @xcite , the hamiltonian ( [ hammod ] ) can be brought to the form given in equation ( 6.2 ) of @xcite with g=0 , whose eigenvalues and eigenvectors provide the refractive indices and the associated polarization vectors of dichroic , non - chiral crystals",
    ". reference @xcite provides a very detailed description of such crystals at and around three types of singularities , ( called singular axes , c - points of circular polarization , which in the absence of chirality coincide with the singular axes , and l - lines of linear polarization ) that may occur dependent on the choice of the three parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath3 . in the following",
    "we will rederive those properties of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian ( [ hammod ] ) , which are observable using our experimental setup .",
    "the complex eigenvalues coincide if the square root vanishes .",
    "hence , at the two eps of @xmath6 , one has the relation @xmath11 between the parameters of the hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore , the parameter @xmath3 is non - zero at an ep .",
    "else , i.e. if @xmath3 vanishes , the space of eigenvectors is two - dimensional ( see eq .",
    "( [ hammod ] ) ) , and a degeneracy rather than an ep occurs .",
    "since we are interested in the behavior of the eigenvectors of @xmath6 in the vicinity of an ep , we furthermore define the complex parameter @xmath12 which becomes @xmath13 at an ep , i.e. when eq .",
    "( [ epcond ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "the eigenvectors , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , of @xmath6 can then be written as functions of @xmath16 .",
    "normalizing the left hand eigenvectors @xmath17 and the right hand eigenvectors @xmath18 in the biorthogonal sense , they can be defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is defined by @xmath21 this choice of normalization of course defines the left and right eigenvectors only up to an additional phase , which cancels out when evaluating the absolute value of the eigenvectors .",
    "hence , this additional phase may not be observed with our experimental setup ( see sect .",
    "[ sec:3neu ] ) .",
    "when varying @xmath16 continuously along a closed curve around one of the eps , i.e. around @xmath22 or @xmath23 , the phase of @xmath24 will change by @xmath25 .",
    "accordingly , _ one _ of the square - root functions in the second line of eq .",
    "( [ deftheta ] ) , namely that corresponding to @xmath26 , changes its sign , whereas @xmath27 will return to its original value as long as exactly one ep is encircled .",
    "hence , encircling an ep implies a change from @xmath28 to @xmath29 , where @xmath30 that is , @xmath31 to compare the eigenvectors of @xmath6 before and after encircling an ep in the @xmath16-plane , we use the abbreviation @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes some value of @xmath16 . starting from this initial value",
    "@xmath33 we track the development of the eigenvectors of @xmath6 when an ep is encircled . comparing the eigenvectors before and after encircling an ep , i.e. inserting @xmath20 and @xmath34 into eq .",
    "( [ eigenvecmod ] ) , then yields the transformation scheme @xmath35 while inserting @xmath20 and @xmath36 leads to @xmath37 both schemes have been observed experimentally @xcite in a particularly shaped microwave billiard ( see sect .  [ sec:3 ] ) by changing the orientation of the closed loop around the ep , as indicated by the symbols @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "changing the orientation of the loop is equivalent to following a given scheme backwards . in both cases , _ four _ turns around the ep are needed in order to restore the original situation ( see also @xcite ) . at this point",
    "we note , that if @xmath16 changes continuously along a closed curve , which encircles _ both _",
    "eps , then the sign of _ both _ square - root functions in the second line of ( [ deftheta ] ) will change , that is , each of the eigenvectors @xmath40 and @xmath41 transforms into itself . if , however , both eps are encircled with opposite orientation by tracing out an 8 , then both eigenvectors will acquire an extra phase @xmath42 , that is a phase which coincides with berry s phase for the encircling of a diabolical point ( see sect .",
    "[ sec:3neu ] ) .    the resulting transformation schemes ( eqs .",
    "( [ phasena ] ) and ( [ phasenb ] ) ) are not surprising since the eigenvectors ( [ eigenvecmod ] ) have a branch point of a fourth root at the ep .",
    "this can be easily seen by noting that ( i ) the tangent in eq .",
    "( [ deftheta ] ) depends on @xmath43 and ( ii ) an additional square root is needed for the computation of the sine- and cosine - functions in eq .",
    "( [ eigenvecmod ] ) , from the tangent viz .",
    "@xmath44 if @xmath16 is real , the components of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , are real .",
    "hence , if @xmath16 is sufficiently far from the eps , i.e. @xmath45 the eigenvectors are approximately real .",
    "keeping only terms up to the first order in @xmath46 we obtain @xmath47 therefore the eigenfunctions are approximately real along the path sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , which either follows the real axis of the complex @xmath16-plane or fulfills eq .",
    "( [ largeb ] ) .",
    "we note here that along the lower part of the path sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , i.e. far away from @xmath48 , the components of the eigenvectors depend only linearly on @xmath46 .",
    "we therefore expect , that the experimentally measured eigenvectors vary only slightly along this part of the path .",
    "if the nodal line patterns are tracked along this path in an experiment , they can be used to reconstruct the eigenstates according to berry and wilkinson @xcite .",
    "in the following section we will discuss why _ only _ the transformation schemes ( [ phasena ] ) and ( [ phasenb ] ) are observed in experiments ( see @xcite and sect .  [ sec:3 ] ) .",
    "one can redefine the eigenvectors such that @xmath49 this conserves the biorthogonal normalization . if the phase @xmath50 is e.g. constructed @xcite so that after two loops around an ep it equals @xmath42 then one obtains @xmath51 after two loops .",
    "this seems to disagree with the schemes ( [ phasena],[phasenb ] ) claiming that @xmath52 after two loops . in the present section",
    "we show that the experimental result ( [ phasena ] ) for the phase change of the eigenvectors ( [ eigenvecmod ] ) remains unchanged under the replacement ( [ eigenvectorswithphase ] ) . in the first subsection",
    "the essence of the argument is presented in a rather general and abstract way . in the second subsection",
    "the loops around an ep are described in a more physical way . in the third subsection",
    ", we consider eigenstates with an additional phase , as defined in ( [ eigenvectorswithphase ] ) , and show , that the results of the second subsection remain unchanged . in the last subsection we show that the present arguments yield the well - known geometrical phase occurring when a dp is encircled .      in the experiment described in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] and in @xcite the development of the eigenvectors ( [ eigenvecmod ] ) is tracked .",
    "their coefficients are analytical functions of @xmath16 everywhere except at the eps .",
    "analytical functions are arbitrarily often differentiable . in this sense",
    "they are the smoothest possible functions .    except for a parameter - independent phase ,",
    "the vectors ( [ eigenvecmod ] ) are even the only analytical representation of the eigenvectors , because a system of biorthogonal eigenvectors is well defined up to an arbitrary phase @xmath53 as introduced in ( [ eigenvectorswithphase ] ) with a complex @xmath16 .",
    "the phase is real in all the domain where one is allowed to choose the path @xmath54 . except for the constant",
    "there is no analytical function which is real on some area in the complex plane .",
    "hence , multiplying ( [ eigenvecmod ] ) with a phase factor depending on @xmath16 yields non - analytical eigenvectors .    instead of claiming that the experiment follows ( [ eigenvecmod ] ) , one can therefore state that ( [ eigenvecmod ] ) is the smoothest interpolation between the experimental pictures of the eigenfunctions . in this sense",
    "it is the simplest mathematical interpretation of the sequence of wave functions presented in fig .",
    "3 . according to the argument of ockham s razor @xcite one can not hope for anything else .    in the next subsection",
    ", a physical process is discussed that allows to explicitly follow a given eigenvector on a path encircling an ep .",
    "it yields in sect .",
    "[ sec:3neu.3 ] the result announced above .      the physical process is the one introduced by berry in @xcite  modified to the treatment of complex symmetric ( instead of hermitian ) @xmath6 and to loops around an ep ( instead of a dp ) .",
    "let @xmath55 depend on a set @xmath56 of parameters .",
    "the eigenvectors @xmath57 , @xmath58 and eigenvalues @xmath59 depend on @xmath56 .    in a first step ,",
    "we consider @xmath60 as a function of time .",
    "the state @xmath61 of the system is the solution of the time dependent schrdinger equation @xmath62 , i.e. @xmath63 expanding @xmath61 into the instantaneous eigenstates @xmath64 at time @xmath65 and assuming , that the parameter @xmath66 is changed so slowly , that the adiabatic approximation is applicable @xcite , we obtain latexmath:[\\[|\\psi(t)\\rangle = \\exp\\left ( -i \\int_0^tdt'e_n(\\vec{r}(t'))\\right ) \\exp\\left(i\\phi ( \\vec{r}(t'))\\right )    adiabatic approximation implies , that at each instant @xmath65 the state @xmath68 is proportional to the instantaneous eigenstate @xmath64 , if it is proportional to @xmath69 at time @xmath70 .",
    "the dynamical phase @xmath71 is well known .",
    "of special interest is the additional phase @xmath50 which is due to the motion in parameter space . with the ansatz ( [ phaseintegral ] ) , schrdingers equation ( [ schroedingereq ] ) yields the equation @xmath72 for the phase @xmath50 . using biorthogonality",
    "this gives @xmath73 the solution is @xmath74 the last integral is a path integral in @xmath56-space .",
    "the parameters move along the path @xmath54 between time zero and time @xmath65 .",
    "this means that the time has only served to parameterise the path .",
    "the last integral is independent of time and should therefore be valid not only for an adiabatic process but also in the present experimental context , where a continuous variation of the parameters is considered .",
    "let @xmath75 be the real and imaginary parts of b , and let @xmath76 , @xmath77 be defined as in ( [ eigenvecmod ] ) .",
    "then ( [ alphaeq2 ] ) is a path integral in the complex plane of b , viz . @xmath78",
    "the integrand is analytic everywhere except at the eps .",
    "the function @xmath79 is multivalued ",
    "it is defined on a riemannian surface rather than the complex plane .",
    "but on that surface , it is analytic everywhere . especially it is continuous on every path @xmath54 that avoids the eps .",
    "along such a path one has @xmath80 the first line of this equation holds because @xmath81 is just the transpose of @xmath77 .",
    "the result is due to the biorthogonal normalisation .",
    "hence , the choice ( [ eigenvecmod ] ) for the eigenfunctions leads to @xmath82 if the path @xmath54 does not cross an ep .",
    "in other words : our choice of the normalization implies that the total phase acquired by a state @xmath68 when encircling an ep in parameter space is obtained from the change of the eigenstates , that is , from the transformation schemes ( [ phasena],[phasenb ] ) . as will be shown in the next subsection",

    "[ sec:3neu.1 ] one shows that @xmath91 , as long as the path does not cross an ep . as a result",
    ", our choice of the normalization of the eigenstates has the specific property , that all phase changes acquired by a state @xmath68 when encircling an ep are solely obtained from the transformation schemes ( 13,14 ) independent of the phase conventions chosen for the eigenstates  in agreement with the argument given in sect .",
    "[ sec:3neu.1 ] . for comparison",
    "we briefly discuss  in the following subsection  the well - known phase that occurs when a diabolic point is encircled .",
    "a diabolic point is a degeneracy of the eigenvalues such that there are two linearly independent eigenvectors .",
    "it is most easily obtained as a degeneracy in a system described by a real , symmetric @xmath6 .",

    "encircling corresponds to moving the vector @xmath96 around the origin , e.g. with @xmath97 this yields the eigenvectors @xmath98 and @xmath99 one sees that encircling a dp changes the sign of the eigenvectors  this is berry s phase @xcite .    strictly speaking",
    ", the path ( [ parametrization ] ) can not be represented as a closed curve in the complex plane of @xmath16 . according to ( [ parametrization ] ) , @xmath16 is real for all @xmath100 except @xmath101 , where it goes to infinity . in order to circumvent this difficulty one can add a small imaginary part to @xmath3 and replace ( [ h12zero ] ) by @xmath102 by virtue of ( [ parametrization ] ) , the parameter @xmath103 then moves on a path that has the shape of a figure - eight and encircles the eps at @xmath104 and @xmath105 in opposite directions .",
    "we have convinced ourselves that such a closed path changes the phase of the eigenvectors by @xmath42  in agreement with berry s phase .",
    "the parameterisation in terms of @xmath16 is similar to the one discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , the authors of @xcite did not exactly specify the path chosen for encircling a dp .",
    "note that a closed path which encircles both eps in the same sense does not change the phase of the eigenvectors .",
    "the geometric phases which occur when an ep is encircled have been observed for the first time in the microwave cavity experiment described in @xcite .",
    "flat microwave resonators as the one used in @xcite are commonly known as microwave billiards and form one cornerstone for the experimental investigation of quantum chaotic phenomena ( for an overview see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "they compose an analog computer that solves the schrdinger equation for quantum billiards .",
    "the circular resonator employed in the experiment @xcite was manufactured of copper and divided by a conducting wall into two approximate half - circles .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] shows a photograph of the cavity without its lid .",
    "an opening of length @xmath106 in the wall couples the two semi - circular parts of the cavity .",
