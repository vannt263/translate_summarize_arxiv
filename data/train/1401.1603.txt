    "radiochromic film dosimetry with flatbed scanners and gafchromic films ( ashland inc . , wayne , nj ) has been extensively studied in the literature@xcite .",
    "high spatial resolution , near water equivalence@xcite and weak energy dependence@xcite make radiochromic films convenient for measurements whenever sharp dose gradients , tissue heterogeneities or charged particle disequilibrium conditions exist .",
    "this opens up a wide range of applications for radiochromic films in the field of radiotherapy .",
    "recently , different multichannel dosimetry methods have been proposed to take into account the information conveyed by all three color channels delivered by the scanner .",
    "micke _ _ et al__@xcite proposed the use of channel - independent perturbations to compensate for variations in the thickness of the active layer , artifacts , nonuniform response of the scanner or other disturbances .",
    "they found a substantial gain in dosimetric accuracy using this method . van hoof _ _ et al__@xcite found that this method performs at least as well as the conventional single - red - channel dosimetry .",
    "mayer _ _ et al__@xcite derived a closed - form solution to obtain the dose employing channel - independent perturbations .",
    "they also compared different single , dual and triple channel methods , and found better agreement between planned and calculated dose distributions using the average dose of all three channels in comparison to using the channel - independent perturbations method . in an earlier article@xcite ,",
    "our group suggested calculating the film dose as the weighted mean dose of all three channels .",
    "for each channel , the inverse of the mean square error obtained during the film calibration was used as weight . with this method",
    ", triple - channel dosimetry was found to be substantially superior to single - red - channel dosimetry .",
    "the purpose of this work is to compare both weighted mean and micke - mayer methods , considering them as special cases of a more general channel - independent perturbations method .",
    "deficiencies and important problems associated with both methods will be explained . to overcome these problems ,",
    "an improved multichannel film dosimetry method will be introduced .",
    "its performance against the other methods will be verified by comparing film dose distributions with planned as well as with measured dose distributions .",
    "in addition , other elements of the dosimetry process will be compared : film types@xcite , scanning modes@xcite , scanning waiting - time windows@xcite and choices of reference dose distribution .",
    "channel - independent perturbations are obtained by applying a first order taylor expansion to the dose due to a small perturbation :    @xmath3    micke _ _ et al__@xcite derived the dose from the optical density ( od ) of the irradiated film .",
    "mayer _ _ et al__@xcite used pixel values directly . in this study , better results were found in preliminary tests using net optical density@xcite ( nod ) in comparison to using od .",
    "therefore , the channel - independent perturbation consists of a change in nod and is represented by @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 represents the dose absorbed by the film at point @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is the absolute dose measured by the channel @xmath8 , _",
    "i.e. _ , red ( r ) , green ( g ) or blue ( b ) channel , when no disturbance is present , and it is calculated directly from the calibration model . in this study ,",
    "the calibration model includes the lateral correction@xcite and the sensitometric curve .",
    "@xmath9 is the first derivative of the dose , with respect to the nod , at point @xmath6 .",
    "finally , @xmath10 is an error term accounting for the difference between the dose absorbed by the film and the dose measured in the channel @xmath8 after correction by the perturbation .    both for reflection@xcite and transmission mode scanning , the nod , denoted by @xmath11 ,",
    "was defined as    @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 represent pixel values of nonirradiated and irradiated films , respectively , after applying lateral corrections .",
    "our previous results@xcite found better fit when lateral corrections are absolute corrections independent of dose , and sensitometric curves are polynomial fits of order four .",
    "hence , lateral corrections were calculated as    @xmath15    where @xmath16 represents uncorrected pixel values , the @xmath17 axis is parallel to the ccd array , @xmath18 is the _ x _ coordinate of the center of the scanner , @xmath19 represents corrected pixel values , and @xmath20 are fitting parameters .",
    "sensitometric curves followed    @xmath21    and @xmath22 was    @xmath23    where @xmath24 are fitting parameters .",
    "the values of @xmath4 and @xmath10 for @xmath25 in eq.([eqsystem ] ) are unknown . as a result ,",
    "the absorbed dose @xmath5 can not be obtained directly .",
    "however , one can examine different probability density functions ( pdf ) for @xmath4 and @xmath10 and , if @xmath5 is known , analyze how well these models reproduce the absorbed dose distribution .",
    "given the pdfs of @xmath26 , symbolized by @xmath27 , and of each @xmath28 , symbolized by @xmath29 , the joint pdf of @xmath30 , symbolized by @xmath31 , is :    @xmath32    taking into account that @xmath26 and @xmath28 are not independent from each other : @xmath33    let us consider that the error terms are distributed normally with zero mean and @xmath34 variance : @xmath35    the joint pdf of @xmath30 becomes : @xmath36    three different models for @xmath27 will be considered :    \\a ) normally distributed perturbation ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath37 ) :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 represents the number of color channels ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath40 ) and    @xmath41    @xmath42    @xmath43    \\b ) truncated normal distribution with @xmath44 :    @xmath45    excluding a normalizing term independent of @xmath30 .",
    "\\c ) uniform distribution with @xmath44 : is a special case of eq.([truncated ] ) where @xmath46 goes to infinity , therefore @xmath47 .",
    "the most likely value of the absorbed dose @xmath30 , symbolized by @xmath48 , is the one that maximizes @xmath31 . the exponential term in @xmath31 , @xmath49 ,",
    "can be expressed in terms of @xmath30 as a gaussian function :    @xmath50    where    @xmath51    and    @xmath52    a is defined in eq.([adef ] ) and    @xmath53    @xmath54    @xmath55    @xmath56    eq.([dose ] ) and eq.([uncertainty ] ) can be considered , respectively , as the estimated absolute dose and its type b uncertainty @xcite .",
    "this result is exact for normally distributed perturbations and an approximation for truncated normal and uniform distributions .",
    "four models of channel - independent perturbations were compared : weighted mean ( wm ) , micke - mayer ( mm ) method , uniform distribution ( ud ) and truncated normal distribution ( tn ) .",
    "they are summarized in table  [ tab : models ] .",
    "the weighted mean method is a limit case of eq.([eqsystem ] ) in which @xmath57 .",
    "thus , all three channels are independent of each other , which implies that correlations between channels are neglected .",
    "the method employed by micke _ _ et al__@xcite and mayer _ _ et al__@xcite is a special case of eq.([eqsystem ] ) where all @xmath58 are equal and @xmath27 is uniformly distributed . under these premises ,",
    "eq.([dose ] ) becomes :    @xmath59    which coincides with the closed - form solution derived by mayer _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in the dose associated to this model becomes :    @xmath60    the uniform distribution model is a more general and realistic model for the perturbation than the mm one . in this case , @xmath27 is uniformly distributed but the @xmath58 can differ .",
    "finally , the truncated normal distribution model considers that @xmath27 follows a truncated normal distribution .",

    "protocols t provided better results than t , and t better than r. however , the differences are not significant . in table  [ tab : pair_23 ] , there is almost no difference between employing film type ebt2 ( 2 ) or ebt3 ( 3 ) . table  [ tab : pair_em ] shows significant ( @xmath61 ) differences between calibration with planned ( p ) or measured ( m ) reference dose distributions .",
    "this result could be explained assuming that , for the edw plan used in the calibration , the dose distribution measured with matrixx has less uncertainty than the dose planned with eclipse 10 .",
    "table  [ tab : pair_em ] shows significantly ( @xmath61 ) better results for the gamma analysis with planned ( p ) than with measured ( m ) dose distributions .",

    "in addition to these , two novel models were proposed , a more realistic extension to the micke - mayer model which uses uniform distributed perturbations but allows the error terms to differ from one channel to another , and a truncated normal distribution , which comprises the other models as particular or limit cases .",
    "a closed - form formula for dose calculation was derived for all four models , and it coincides with the published one@xcite in the case of the micke - mayer model . in addition , type b uncertainties in film dose due to the channel - independent perturbations method were obtained .    in order to assess the performance of the models , a set of tests",
    "was devised in which the dose distributions obtained from films were compared to either planned , or measured dose distributions . in these tests , the truncated normal distribution model provided the best agreement between film and reference doses , both for calibration and @xmath0-index verification , and proved itself superior to both the weighted mean model , which neglects correlations between the channels , and the micke - mayer and the uniform distribution models , whose accuracy depends on the properties of the sensitometric curves . as a conclusion , we feel confident to recommend the truncated normal distribution model of channel - independent perturbations for multichannel dosimetry .    along with the models , other factors which could influence the dosimetry process were also evaluated .",
    "no significant differences were found between transmission mode scanning and reflection mode scanning , between @xmath1 min versus @xmath2 h waiting - time window or between employing ebt2 or ebt3 films .",
