    "from computer games and medicine to weather predictions and new technologies , nearly every aspect of our lives is influenced by mathematical modeling .",
    "a primary barrier to forward progress in teaching mathematical modeling across our partner disciplines is misconceptions and biases around what constitutes modeling .",
    "we ( the co - authors ) are part of an interdisciplinary working group at the national institute for mathematical and biological synthesis ( nimbios ) that has brought together mathematicians , biologists , and education researchers to address teaching quantitative biology , especially modeling .",
    "each of us has experienced reaching out to collaborate with a member of another discipline , only to have the conversation shut down before it has really started because of the naive assumptions we make about the other s discipline .",
    "we posit that if mathematicians and biologists alike can improve their understanding of the similarities and differences in their approaches to and language around modeling , then each discipline will play a more effective role in advancing the other @xcite , and we will be able to teach this valuable skill more effectively . in this paper",
    "we describe a framework for models and modeling that can bridge the communication gap between disciplinary boundaries , enabling mathematicians , statisticians , and biologists to come together to improve student learning .    in 2012 ,",
    "the president s council of advisors on science and technology ( pcast ) released the _ engage to excel _ report @xcite .",
    "the report recommended that we should engage in a national experiment that encourages faculty from math - intensive fields other than math to be involved in teaching mathematics as a way to help close the mathematics achievement gap @xcite .",
    "the subtext is that traditionally trained mathematics educators are failing at helping our students succeed at mathematics as applied to science and technology .    soon after , the national research council ( nrc ) released a study , titled _ the mathematical sciences in 2025 _ , which suggested that in order for the mathematical sciences to remain strong in the united states , the education of students should be conducted in a cross - disciplinary manner that reflects these ever - changing realities @xcite .",
    "this requires a rethinking of the curricula in the mathematical sciences , especially for mathematics and statistics departments , in order to provide the additional quantitative skills needed for students entering the workforce in the fastest growing career fields , such as those in stem .",
    "mathematics professional societies responded to this call with the _ common vision _ project , which identified ways of improving undergraduate curricula and education in the mathematical sciences by bringing together leaders from five mathematical and statistical associations @xcite .",
    "the project summarized the collective recommendations of seven other curricular guides on undergraduate education from the associations , as well as added its own suggestions for improving undergraduate education in the mathematical sciences , especially in the first two years .",
    "the _ common vision _",
    "project concluded that departments should increase efforts to update curricula , support evidence - based pedagogical methods , and establish connections with other disciplines .    from the survey of curricular guides ,",
    "the _ common vision _",
    "project identified six themes for improving undergraduate curricula .",
    "they are : ( 1 ) to find more pathways into and through the curriculum for both stem and non - stem majors ; ( 2 ) to increase the presence of statistics in student training ; ( 3 ) to increase the use of modeling and computation in order to enhance conceptual understanding and introduce the scientific method into math classes ; ( 4 ) to connect to skills needed in other disciplines ; ( 5 ) to improve communication skills through technical writing and presentations ; and ( 6 ) to aid in the transition from secondary to post - secondary education as well as from two - year to four - year institutions for transfer students .",
    "modeling can play an important part of several of these themes , not just where it is mentioned explicitly . _",
    "common vision _ notes that an early introduction to modeling , along with statistics and computation , can be a pathway `` into and through mathematical sciences curricula '' @xcite .",
    "the society for industrial and applied mathematics ( siam ) suggests that professional societies play a greater role in the incorporation of modeling throughout the undergraduate curriculum @xcite , such as through the now - created siam special interest activity group on applied mathematics education , that recommends the development of a first - year modeling course that `` precedes and motivates the study of calculus and other fundamental mathematics for stem majors '' @xcite .",
    "the american statistical association s curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs in statistical science suggests that incorporating statistical modeling with simulations into mathematics courses can improve computational skills @xcite .",
    "the mathematics association of america s subcommittee on curriculum renewal across the first two years ( crafty ) released a report in 2004 @xcite , titled _ the curriculum foundations project : voices of the partner disciplines _ , which emphasized mathematical modeling in math courses .",
    "the report noted that `` every disciplinary group in every workshop '' identified mathematical modeling as an essential part of training students in the first two years of their undergraduate experience .",
    "furthermore , having students engage in mathematical modeling can `` provide a mechanism for communication , expression , and reasoning that is cross - cultural and cross - disciplinary '' @xcite , while having students develop a `` set of transferable skills that has the potential to be far more impactful on their futures '' @xcite .",
    "these findings are not exclusive to mathematics departments , but in fact run parallel to findings within mathematics partner disciplines .",
    "for example , in biology , three reports , _",
    "bio2010 _ by the national academy of science ( nas ) , _ vision and change _ by the american association for the advancement in science ( aaas ) and the _ scientific foundations for future physicians ( sffp ) _ report of the american association of medical colleges - howard hughes medical institute committee , all mention the important role of mathematics , and specifically modeling , in the future of biology as a discipline @xcite . _ bio2010 _ outlines , in an incredible amount of detail , the core concepts that future research biologists need from mathematics and computing , which include multiple mentions of modeling ( both mathematical and statistical ) throughout , as well as a section devoted to important modeling concepts . _",
    "vision and change _ specifically names the _ ability to use modeling and simulation _ as a _ core competency _ ( emphasis added ) .",
    "the _ sffp _ report also identifies modeling as a _ core competency _ in the following way : students should be able to `` apply quantitative knowledge and reasoning  including integration of data , modeling , computation , and analysis  and informatics tools to diagnostic and therapeutic clinical decision making . ''",
    "based on the anecdotal experience of the co - authors , it seems that there are disciplinary differences by what is meant by models and modeling between mathematicians , statisticians , and biologists .",
    "for example , does modeling require the use of data , or even numbers ?",
    "does it require symbolic equations or formulas ? does a schematic qualify as a model ?",
    "this is compounded on the mathematical side by the historical , philosophical , and physical separation of departments of mathematics and statistics on large campuses , and the teaching of statistics in many different departments ( statistics , mathematics , biology , psychology , economics , business , education , kinesiology , etc . ) on many campuses , both large and small . on the biological side",
    ", there are many different subdisciplines , each with their own rich modeling traditions , _ e.g. _ , physiological modeling , ecological modeling , and more recently , systems biology modeling , among others .",
    "there is also the specific field of mathematical biology , whose practitioners may move fluidly between the identities of mathematician and biologist . if , in all of this diversity , we are not clear about our definitions of models and modeling , then our students will not be clear .",
    "we think , however , that it is possible to articulate an overarching framework for models and modeling that will unify what seem like disparate traditions with the advantage of improving student learning .    ) .",
    "each arrow is an activity in the modeling process ( defined in table [ table : arrows ] ) . ]    for our discussions below , we define _ model _ as a simplified , abstract or concrete representation of relationships and/or processes in the real world . by simplified ,",
    "we mean that it corresponds to a caricature of the real world rather than the real world itself ( figure [ fig : elephant ] ) .",
    "we categorize representations of models into five types : * experiential * , * numerical * , * symbolic * , * verbal * , and * visual * ( figure [ fig : framework ] , boxes ) .",
    "this `` rule of five '' categorization has been used previously in different contexts and will be discussed in detail in the next section @xcite .    with model representations as _ objects _ clearly defined , we now define _ modeling _ as a _ process_. we define modeling as 1 ) the process of moving from observations of the real world to a model , 2 ) moving from one model representation to another model representation , or 3 ) comparing different models ( figure [ fig : framework ] , arrows ) .    in the sections below",
    ", we will explain what we mean by the `` rule of five '' framework , give illustrative examples of both model representations and the modeling process using the logistic growth model , the hardy - weinberg equilibrium ( hwe ) model , and a physical model of the structure of dna , and show how this framework works whether approached from the point of view of mathematics , statistics , or biology . while our focus in this paper is to provide a framework that will facilitate communication between mathematicians , statisticians , and biologists , this framework is adaptable to any stem discipline .",
    "the crafty report , described above , noted that by engaging in mathematical modeling , students have an opportunity to describe their work , `` * * analytically * * , * graphically * , * numerically * , and * verbally * '' @xcite .",
    "these model descriptions are historically referred to as `` the rule of four '' @xcite .",
    "this concept came about in the 1980s and 1990s when it was recognized that over half of students enrolled in calculus courses in the united states did not finish the course @xcite .",
    "this led to a number of calculus reform projects , many of which were funded by the national science foundation .",
    "several of these projects used a `` multiple representation approach , '' @xcite as was suggested in the national council of teachers of mathematics _ curriculum and evaluation standards for school mathematics _",
    "these ideas then came to the forefront with the work of hiebert and colleagues @xcite .",
    "hiebert argued that in order to learn mathematics , a student must understand mathematics .",
    "such understanding occurs when there is a continually evolving and strengthening network of connections to internal mental representations of mathematical ideas and procedures .",
    "hiebert proposed a framework to aid in the understanding of mathematics by making connections between * numerical * , * graphical * , and * symbolic * representations .",
    "note that the * symbolic * representation was called * analytical * by crafty above and has also been called * algebraic * by other projects .",
    "the _ calculus connections project _ of oregon state university implemented a reform calculus emphasizing the representations of * graphical * , * numerical * , and * symbolic * , and the importance of switching between representations @xcite .",
    "olaf project _ also described moving among the representations of * graphical * , * numerical * , and * algebraic * as being crucial to learning the concepts of calculus @xcite .",
    "the _ calculus consortium _ at harvard university coined the term `` rule of three '' in their reform textbook @xcite .",
    "the `` rule '' stated that equal weight should be given to describing topics * algebraically * , * numerically * , and * geometrically * @xcite .",
    "note that the original word choice for the representations `` parallels '' course descriptions at the secondary level @xcite . in the second edition of the text @xcite , this became a `` rule of four '' with a fourth equal - emphasis on * verbal * descriptions of math problems by teachers and students . in subsequent editions of the text @xcite , the descriptions of the four representations became * graphical * , * numerical * , * symbolic * , and * verbal*. since the inception of calculus reform in the 1990s , it is now commonplace to see a wider variety of problems and the use of multiple representations in `` traditional '' math textbooks @xcite .",
    "more recently , a fifth rule was proposed by simundza in a laboratory course for precalculus @xcite .",
    "this fifth rule , * experiential * , is , in the words of simundza , a `` direct sensory experience of quantitative phenomena '' @xcite .",
    "the importance of the * experiential * representation is alluded to in the american mathematical association of two - year colleges ( amatyc ) standards where they propose that mathematics be taught like the sciences as a laboratory discipline @xcite .",
    "we are also using * experiential * for model representations , because introducing students to multiple forms of representation have been shown to improve student learning .",
    "the first principle guideline from the universal design for learning ( udl ) is a recommendation to provide students multiple forms of representation since there are diverse ways learners comprehend information @xcite .",
    "udl is a framework that addresses high variability in learners responses to instruction by suggesting flexibility in the curriculum to meet the varied needs of the students . using multiple representations",
    "can allow students to make connections within and between concepts @xcite .",
    "when students solved problems using more than one representation , student performance was better than for those learners who used a single strategy @xcite .    the use of multiple forms of representation and the `` rule of five '' mirrors the parable of the blind men and the elephant as seen in figure [ fig : elephant ] .",
    "john godfrey saxe s poem version of the parable describes six blind men touching different parts of an elephant in order to `` understand '' it @xcite .",
    "each blind man compares each different elephant part to an everyday object that is similar - a wall ( side ) , snake ( trunk ) , spear ( tusk ) , tree ( knee ) , fan ( ear ) or rope ( tail ) . just as in the parable",
    ", it is only through the use of different forms of representation that we may hope to gain the truest understanding of a problem .",
    "interestingly , this analogy to the parable also works when considering the different ways in which mathematicians and biologists approach problems - each is experiencing one aspect of the problem , and through communication using a common language around modeling , we can create together a clearer picture of the world .",
    "as discussed above and shown in figure [ fig : framework ] and table [ table : boxes ] , we extend the `` rule of five '' from its original use as an aid to calculus and precalculus instruction to a useful general description of model representations .",
    ".the five types of model representations , corresponding to figure [ fig : framework ] with their definitions and classroom examples . [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < \" , ]     table [ table : arrows ] describes the modeling activities contained in the arrows between boxes in figure [ fig : framework ] .",
    "we felt that it was important to present a fully connected graph to be inclusive of all potential uses of this framework , although some activities ( arrows ) would be more commonly performed than others . for each activity",
    ", we have suggested ideas for how the framework could be used in the classroom in the context of teaching models of logistic growth , hardy - weinberg equilibrium , or the structure of dna . since the reader may be least familiar with * experiential * activities",
    ", we have chosen to describe the connections to - and - from * experiential * representations both below and in table [ table : arrows ] .",
    "for an arrow description and classroom example of all other connections , see table [ table : arrows ] .",
    "* experiential * representations can either be simulations , physical models , or the conducting of a laboratory or field experiment . moving from * experiential * to * verbal * ( arrow 1 ) involves generating a formal scientific hypothesis , which implies mechanism , making predictions , or collecting qualitative observations from an experiment . moving from * verbal * to * experiential * ( arrow 2 ) is the converse , designing and executing an experiment to provide evidence for a hypothesis . moving from * experiential * to * numerical * ( arrow 3 ) involves collecting quantitative data from either an experiment or simulation . moving from * numerical * to",
    "* experiential * ( arrow 4 ) refers to * numerical * data fed into a simulation or used to create a physical model .",
    "it could also mean validation of a model against new experiments . moving from * symbolic * to * experiential * involves coding equations to create simulations ( arrow 17 ) .",
    "arrow 18 ( * experiential * to * symbolic * ) is the converse .",
    "for example , experienced modelers might immediately recognize logistic growth and write the equation for it . moving from * experiential * to * visual * involves drawing a sketch , graph , or schematic based on experiential observations ( arrow 19 ) .",
    "arrow 20 ( * visual * to * experiential * ) involves making a physical model from a drawing , such as making a physical three dimensional model of dna from a two - dimensional drawing ( constructing an ikea book shelf from purely visual instructions and doing origami from folding schematics are two everyday examples of this ) .",
    "we want to emphasize that work performed entirely within one particular box alone is not `` modeling '' per se , but the province of the disciplinary context within which the work is performed .",
    "for example , a set of qualitative observations alone is a model representation for biologists ( see table [ table : boxes ] ) .",
    "however , the process of designing and setting up the experiment to collect those qualitative data based on a scientific hypothesis ( arrows 1 and 2 in figure [ fig : framework ] and table [ table : arrows ] , i.e. going from * verbal * to * experiential * and back ) is a modeling activity . in another example , solving a system of differential equations to obtain formulas ( * symbolic * box , figure [ fig : framework ] ) is a mathematics activity and may be an important part of the larger modeling process , but alone is not a modeling activity .",
    "however , using a differential equation to run a simulation ( arrow 10 in figure [ fig : framework ] going from * symbolic * to * numerical * ) or using the solution to plot a graph ( arrow 15 in figure [ fig : framework ] going from * symbolic * to * visual * ) are modeling activities . in a third example , `` application '' problems in which students are given a formula and asked to use it to compute an answer without explaining the meaning is not modeling @xcite .",
    "however , more extended problems in which models are used to create simulated data ( arrow 10 in figure [ fig : framework ] going from * symbolic * to * numerical * ) , and in which these results are checked against additional data ( arrow 4 in figure [ fig : framework ] going from * numerical * to * experiential * ) are a much better illustration of modeling",
    ".      we are certainly not the first group to describe a conceptual framework for modeling .",
    "recently siam has documented their take on the modeling process @xcite .",
    "these types of diagrams usually talk about the iterative process of modeling , _ i.e. _ going back and forth between the different stages .",
    "they can be more or less rigid in specifying a particular order of the steps in the modeling process @xcite .",
    "we want to distinguish our paper from this previous literature in two ways : 1 ) by describing a framework for modeling that is inclusive of approaches taken by mathematicians , statisticians , and biologists , and 2 ) emphasizing that the * experiential * representation is crucial for student learning . in what follows ,",
    "we give three examples of pathways through the modeling process / framework , starting from the point of view of mathematicians , statisticians , and biologists .",
    "what these three pathways have in common are that they are `` messy '' and reflect what happens in actual expert practice @xcite .    as we noted previously , a modeling investigation becomes more and more valuable as the number and variety of connections made between different model representations increases . in teaching modeling to students",
    ", it is very helpful to begin the modeling process with something * experiential*. ideally this would use real observations of biological phenomena , as would be done in biology laboratory courses .",
    "if this is not possible , a manipulatable representation of a model would serve as a reasonable starting point ( for example , in biology courses without a lab component , or in mathematics / statistics courses ) .",
    "actual experiments and simulated experiments both belong in the * experiential * box ( figure [ fig : framework ] ) .",
    "depending on the initial experience , * experiential * observations might generate either qualitative or quantitative data , which lead to * verbal * and * numerical * representations of a model , respectively .    in our first example",
    ", coming from the mathematical point of view , we talk about the derivation of a logistic growth model that follows the path * experiential * @xmath0 * numerical * @xmath0 * visual * @xmath0 * verbal * @xmath0 * symbolic*. we begin with an * experiential * representation by performing an experiment to measure the growth of a bacterial culture over time . if this can not be done in class , one could find a time lapse video of the phenomenon .",
    "this approach to developing a * numerical * model would be to use raw population data to calculate absolute and relative growth rates .",
    "one could then obtain a * visual * representation of the model by plotting the data in different ways ( for example , population size versus time , or relative growth rate versus population size ) .",
    "then these steps lead to a * verbal * model consisting of the assumption that the growth rate is proportional to population .",
    "an alternate path would go from * experiential * @xmath0 * verbal * @xmath0 * symbolic * when the * symbolic * model is obtained from the qualitative observation that more parents produce more offspring . in either pathway , the * symbolic * representation of the model does not come directly from qualitative data ( * verbal * box ) or quantitative data ( * numerical * box ) , but comes rather from a * verbal * representation obtained from the initial observations . in this example , the * verbal * representation leads to a * symbolic * representation in the form of a differential ( or difference ) equation .",
    "the pathway can then be extended from * symbolic * @xmath0 * numerical * @xmath0 * visual * by running a simulation to produce data generated by the mathematical * symbolic * model , which can be graphed . or the pathway can be extended from a * symbolic * to * experiential * representation by creating an animation with computer graphics . the pathway can be extended from * symbolic * directly to * visual * by solving the equation analytically and using the resulting formula to prepare a graph . in either case , the * visual * representation may contribute a statement of model behavior to the * verbal * representation .",
    "note that in this description of these pathways , the boxes and arrows are traversed several times and the order of the traversal is not fixed .",
    "the previous example illustrates a modeling pathway that leads to a * symbolic * representation of a mechanistic mathematical model ( logistic growth ) .",
    "the next example illustrates a modeling pathway leading to a * symbolic * representation of a statistical model , given in the context of hwe , which is typically taught in introductory biology courses .",
    "pulling from previous experiments and observations ( * experiential * @xmath0 * verbal * ) , students are introduced to the five major forces in evolution : ( 1 ) selection , ( 2 ) genetic drift , ( 3 ) mutation , ( 4 ) gene flow , and ( 5 ) non - random mating @xcite .",
    "to arrive at the probability model ( * symbolic * ) of hwe , we first assume a null * verbal * model that no evolutionary forces are present .",
    "in particular , suppose we have an isolated ( no gene flow ) , infinite population ( no genetic drift ) where random mating , no selection , and no mutation occurs .",
    "a simplified genetic model also assumes one locus and two alleles .",
    "given this * verbal * model , the * symbolic * probability model representation is derived ( hwe ) stating that allele and genotypic frequencies do not change in subsequent generations .",
    "many times this is where instruction stops , but it is informative to mention that this probability model can then be used to statistically test for the presence of hwe , which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for lack of evolutionary forces .",
    "this is accomplished by measuring genotypic frequencies in a population of interest ( * experiential * @xmath0 * numerical * ) and then performing a chi - squared test to the null probability model of hwe ( * numerical * @xmath0 * symbolic * ) .",
    "results of the test are then used as evidence for the presence or absence of evolutionary forces ( * symbolic * @xmath0 * verbal * ) .",
    "it should be noted that most hypothesis testing in statistics follows this pathway : observed data collected from experiment ( * experiential * @xmath0 * numerical * ) is tested against a null probability model ( * numerical * @xmath0 * symbolic * ) , and the results are used as a quantification of evidence for a biological hypothesis ( * symbolic * @xmath0 * verbal * ) .    finally , let s describe a pathway followed by biologists .",
    "one of the most famous physical models in molecular biology is the physical model of the structure of dna created by james watson and francis crick , that inspired the more abstract schematic that appears in their _ nature _ paper @xcite . to build this model",
    ", they integrated both quantitative and qualitative data from multiple sources ( * numerical * and * verbal * @xmath0 * experiential * ) .",
    "this physical model enabled a hypothesis about mechanism ( * experiential * @xmath0 * verbal * ) : `` it has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material '' @xcite .",
    "one of the co - authors of the current paper regularly uses building a chemically - correct physical model of dna as an activity in her courses . students gain a much deeper understanding of the chemical structure of dna from the direct manipulation of the physical model than from * verbal * descriptions or * visual * aids alone .",
    "note that in this example , not all of the boxes or arrows were traversed , yet it is still an example of the process of modeling that enhances student learning .",
    "ultimately , the results of a modeling investigation need to be checked against original or new qualitative and/or quantitative data ( or even other mathematical models ) .",
    "this is what is called _",
    "model validation_. a careful critique can almost always identify features of the biological system that are missing from the model . in biology , a large amount of stochasticity is often superimposed on deterministic phenomena , so we can not expect a model to exactly reproduce experimental data .",
    "our first example of a modeling pathway , using * experiential * activities to examine logistic growth , would almost surely lead to a data set that does not precisely match the deterministic logistic growth example .",
    "oftentimes , however , an important part of the modeling process includes recognizing when a model may need to be further refined to address the question at hand . in the course of a modeling investigation with students , the instructor s role often is to remind students to pause , validate the model , and if needed , begin again with the modeling process to refine it .    in the instructional setting , we can use figure [ fig : elephant ] to remind students that modeling is theoretical science rather than mathematics per se .",
    "results obtained from the study of a particular mathematical model pertain only to that model . whether they are useful in understanding the biological setting depends on comparing and contrasting model formulation with corresponding biological process and model - generated data with observed or experimental data .",
    "this is a key ingredient in encouraging students to engage in the modeling process . even if students are moving through the boxes and are hence `` modeling",
    ", '' it is imperative to remind them that they are working in a conceptualized model of reality @xcite .",
    "they are using caricatures of reality , not dealing with reality itself , and the assumptions and results should be critically analyzed in that light .    in our example model of logistic growth , there are a number of models that one can use for limited growth",
    ". if the per capita growth rate is constant , the population is growing exponentially @xmath1 .",
    "however there are a number of ways in which a population can experience a decreasing per capita growth rate that results in limited growth .",
    "each of these limited growth scenarios says something different about the process of growth or the growth relationship and each results in slightly different limited growth curves .",
    "when the inflow of a population is exponential and the outflow is mediated by intraspecific competition for resources , @xmath2 , this is equivalent to saying that overall , the per capita growth rate is linear @xmath3 .",
    "however , growth may be limited by other processes which may result in a non - linear decrease of per capita growth rate . in this case",
    ", one might fit many types of mathematical models to the data set and select the model that minimizes error and avoids over - fitting , for example by using a measure such as the akaike information criterion ( often referred to as aic ; for a review of model fitting , see @xcite ) .",
    "the model that has the lowest aic may tell you something about which processes may be driving the population .    in some cases , the fact that a model is not matching the outcomes observed in reality can also be important .",
    "such is the case with the primary use of the hwe model discussed above .",
    "this model predicts the distribution of offspring genotypes in a population given a list of assumptions . if those assumptions are true , and if in the parent generation the probability or frequency of allele a occurs is @xmath4 and the probability that allele a occurs is @xmath5 , then the next generation will have the following distribution of genotypes : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "if the observed distribution in the offspring does not match , this is useful , because then we know that one of the assumptions of the hwe model have been violated .",
    "hwe is considered a classic use - case of a null model in biology @xcite .",
    "we have synthesized a framework around modeling with the view that a unified framework allows us to be more purposeful practitioners around the teaching of modeling . in this paper",
    ", we particularly emphasize the importance of the * experiential * component in the engagement of students and quality of learning .",
    "our use of `` experiential '' in the context of modeling is slightly different than , but is still in alignment with , what is meant by `` experiential learning '' in other contexts @xcite .",
    "there is an abundance of evidence that experiential learning can improve student learning outcomes @xcite .",
    "there is also early evidence that adopting this type of framework , in particular multiple model representations and movements between them , can lead to success in subsequent quantitative courses @xcite .",
    "some students may enter into the learning experience more comfortable with a subset of these representations due to their own ways of knowing or professional identity , but the goal is that they should know all and be able to move between them .",
    "`` understanding science , '' a website that lays out a framework for the process of science , suggests the following three main actions for bringing the process of science into the classroom : ( 1 ) make it explicit , ( 2 ) help the students reflect upon it , and ( 3 ) give it context , again and again @xcite . because modeling is theoretical science , we suggest the same actions to bring our modeling framework into the classroom to strengthen both students understanding of , and abilities in , modeling .",
    "we list these actions again here with specific modeling framework examples :    * be explicit . *",
    "tell your students what you are doing , and why , in the context of modeling .",
    "teach students the modeling framework , including definitions of models and modeling , the different model representations ( boxes ) , and the many modeling activities ( arrows ) .",
    "be clear that biologists are already engaged in modeling but may not realize it or use the same language or approach as mathematicians or statisticians .",
    "there are many first steps with which one can begin modeling , and it does not have to begin the same way that was outlined in our example modeling pathways . teaching any arrow can be a first step in teaching modeling as long as one is explicit in connecting it to the modeling process .    *",
    "help them reflect ( and connect ) .",
    "* have students reflect upon the modeling process by assigning metacognitive exercises , such as a one - minute paper . work with instructors from different disciplines to help students make connections between classes to solidify their understanding of modeling .",
    "using a common framework can help us engage in conversations with colleagues from other disciplines , and thus bring the connections to our students .",
    "* give it context , again and again .",
    "* ground the modeling investigation in the biological problem , using the * experiential * representation .",
    "use the framework to acknowledge and clarify the various approaches that each discipline takes to solving the same scientific problem .",
    "show that different practitioners have different paths through the boxes that are equally valid .",
    "give examples of different paths in the same context .",
    "while traversing the modeling pathways may be intuitive for expert practitioners , some studies have found that students have difficulty translating between model representations @xcite , although the facility of translation did vary depending upon the specific relations selected @xcite . yet , in keeping with the recommendation from understanding science to be explicit @xcite , one study showed that simply telling students the purpose of the multiple representations can have a positive impact on learning @xcite . in particular , schwonke _",
    "et al_.  conducted two studies , collecting gaze data from students viewing multiple representations of the same problem . from the initial study ,",
    "many students did not understand why they should have different representations and why they should transfer between them . to improve the transitions between representations , one group of students in a follow - up study ( reported in the same paper @xcite ) received additional instructions explaining the `` bridge between [ the ] problem texts and equations , '' while a control group did not have these instructions .",
    "et al_.  concluded that an explanation of the different representations improved the learning outcomes for both low- and high - prior knowledge students , but in different ways .",
    "the low - prior knowledge group seemed to `` transfer knowledge more easily between representations , '' while the high - prior knowledge students benefited because they paid more attention to the different representations .",
    "our conclusion from this prior work is that while it is important for the instructor to facilitate use of multiple model representations and modeling activities , it is most valuable when the reasons behind it are made clear to the students , _",
    "i.e. _ , make it explicit , reflect and connect , and provide context @xcite .    for information and ideas around using our framework for teaching ,",
    "see the following collection at qubeshub.org ( https://qubeshub.org/groups/nimbios_wg_teachingquantbio/collections/a-interdisciplinary-framework-for-teaching-modeling--primus-paper ) @xcite .",
    "there have been numerous calls for mathematicians to work more closely with members of partner disciplines , such as biology , to improve student learning and retention in stem ( _ e.g. , the mathematical sciences in 2025 _ and _ a common vision _ , @xcite ) .",
    "analogous to this , there have been numerous calls for biologists to incorporate more mathematical modeling into their curriculum to better prepare students for future careers in research and the health professions ( _ e.g. , vision and change _ , _ bio2010 _ , _ scientific foundations for future physicians _ , @xcite ) . despite this widespread agreement on what needs to happen , implementing the recommendations",
    "has been slow .",
    "one barrier that must be overcome to initiate true transdisciplinary conversations and collaborations on improving the modeling curriculum is to agree upon a common definition of what is meant by models and modeling between biologists , mathematicians , and statisticians .",
    "therefore , we have proposed adapting the `` rule of five '' , which has previously informed calculus reform efforts , to describe a framework for modeling that can bring all the disciplines together .",
    "this framework defines five types of model representations ( * experiential * , * verbal * , * numerical * , * visual * , and * symbolic * ) and modeling activities that provide flexible routes through a modeling investigation by students .",
    "we give examples about what the implementation of this framework may look like in the classroom , along with the associated benefits to student learning @xcite . in particular , an advantage for students working with * experiential * representations is that they provide an entryway for understanding models that do not require the abstraction of * symbolic * or * visual * representations , the integration of detail needed to understand a * numerical * representation , or the conceptual knowledge and reading comprehension needed to understand a * verbal * representation .",
    "finally , we share resources that we think will be helpful for others to use .",
    "we also hope this framework will unify practitioners coming from different parent fields ( mathematics , statistics , and biology ) and allow them to find the similarities and differences in their approaches to modeling , leading to more productive interdisciplinary conversations .",
    "making the connections explicit to students in different disciplinary courses will reinforce the concepts for students and empower them to apply knowledge from one domain to another , making them informed citizens for the 21^st^ century . in their professional futures , students will not encounter textbook questions with multiple choice answers . instead , they will hear a wildlife biologist discuss the rate of population growth , they will see a graph in a paper that they are reading , they will monitor a population , or they will use software to run management scenario planning . a student that can move between these representations to help solve problems is one with a superior preparation for the profession .",
    "we have a trained disciplinary identity , but we are all modelers .",
    "we can work together to help our students be modelers , too .",
