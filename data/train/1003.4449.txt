    "in this paper , we prove that the wrapped fukaya category of a cotangent bundle is expressible in terms of purely homotopy - theoretic data :    [ thm : main_thm ] if @xmath0 is an oriented closed smooth manifold , then any cotangent fibre generates the wrapped fukaya category of @xmath1 with background class @xmath2 given by the pullback of the second stiefel - whitney class of @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the triangulated closure of this fukaya category is quasi - isomorphic to the category of twisted complexes over @xmath3 .    in @xcite",
    ", nadler shows that a different version of the fukaya category of a cotangent bundle which he constructed with zaslow in @xcite whenever @xmath0 is real analytic , is equivalent to the category of constructible sheaves on @xmath0 .",
    "[ rem : sign - error ] the result uses the existence of coherent orientations of moduli spaces of holomorphic discs with boundary on any collection of lagrangians whose second stiefel - whitney class is the restriction of the same background class in the cohomology of the total space , as well as the identification of an appropriate twist of the symplectic cohomology of @xmath4 with the homology of the free loop space of @xmath0 .",
    "the fact that the untwisted version of symplectic cohomology is not in general isomorphic to the homology of the free loop space was verified by seidel for the case of @xmath5 in @xcite , in an attempt to elucidate the source of a sign discrepancy between the construction of a viterbo restriction map on symplectic cohomology @xcite , and a generalisation established by kragh in @xcite using generating functions .",
    "there is also a version of theorem [ thm : main_thm ] , stating that the _ untwisted _ wrapped fukaya category of @xmath4 is also generated by a fibre , and is equivalent to the category of modules over the chains of the based loop space of @xmath0 with twised coefficients ( see remark 1.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "note that as a consequence of the above equivalence , we conclude that the grothendieck @xmath6-group of the wrapped fukaya category of @xmath4 is free of rank @xmath7 , and is generated by the class of a cotangent fibre .",
    "since the zero section intersects the fibre in exactly one point , we find that the homomorphism @xmath8 is realised by taking the euler characteristic of the space of morphisms to ( or from ) the zero section .",
    "the fact that the wrapped fukaya category is _ generated _ rather than split - generated does not follow from the machinery of @xcite . rather , it is a consequence of the existence of an @xmath9 homomorphism @xmath10 from the wrapped floer cochain complex of a cotangent fibre to the pontryagin differential graded algebra @xmath11 of chains on the based loop space , which was constructed in @xcite . on homology",
    "this homomorphism induces a map @xmath12 this map has a closed string analogue from symplectic cohomology to the homology of the space of free loops @xmath13 which is compatible with the grading of both sides by the set of components of the free loop space .",
    "such a map was first proposed by cieliebak and latschev in @xcite who used it to compare algebraic structures in symplectic field theory with those coming from string topology . in section [ sec : count - half - cylind ] , we give a realisation of this map in the setting of floer theory . note that this is one place where the orientability assumption is used : in general , the twisted version of symplectic cohomology that we consider is isomorphic to the homology of the free loop space with coefficients in the orientation bundle of the base , pulled back by evaluation at the basepoint .",
    "[ prop : maps_iso ] @xmath14 and @xmath15 are both isomorphisms .",
    "the statement of this proposition was communicated to the author by schwarz in summer 2009 as an announcement of results obtained and to be written jointly with abbondandolo .",
    "subsequently , a sketch of the proof for @xmath16 was included in section 5 of @xcite .",
    "given the nature of the construction , one can use the same method to show that @xmath17 is an isomorphism , and we briefly discuss the relevant signs in appendix [ sec : signs - orientations ] .",
    "in addition to proposition [ prop : maps_iso ] , the proof of theorem [ thm : main_thm ] relies essentially on the results of @xcite , which defines a map from the hochschild homology of the @xmath9 algebra @xmath18 to symplectic cohomology : @xmath19 which we review in section [ def : floer_datum_discs_interior_puncture ] .    in section [ sec : an - ad - hoc ] , we construct a map @xmath20 which we expect to be an isomorphism since it should be a version of goodwillie s isomorphism from @xcite .",
    "while we do not prove this , we shall prove in appendix [ sec : hitting ] that the fundamental class of @xmath0 , included as constant loops in the homology of the free loop space , lies in the image of @xmath21 .",

    "knowing the two vertical arrows are isomorphisms and that the identity of @xmath24 maps to the fundamental class of @xmath0 under @xmath25 , the commutativity of diagram , together with lemma [ lem : fundamental_class_in_image ] , implies that the identity in symplectic cohomology lies in the image of @xmath26 . by theorem 1.1 in @xcite , we conclude that @xmath27 split - generates the wrapped fukaya category of the cotangent bundle .    to pass from split - generation to generation",
    ", we note that corollary 1.2 in @xcite extends the @xmath9-homomorphism @xmath10 to a functor from the wrapped fukaya category of @xmath4 to the category of twisted complexes over @xmath28 .",
    "since @xmath27 split - generates the wrapped fukaya category , this is a cohomologically fully faithful embedding , and hence every object of the wrapped fukaya category of @xmath4 is in fact isomorphic to an iterated cone of cotangent fibres .    at first sight ,",
    "our claim about the existence of a natural map from hochschild homology to symplectic cohomology would seem to indicate that we failed to account for a dualisation , or at least to properly name one of the two groups .",
    "the reason for the confusion is the fact that , while there is a natural map in the direction we indicated , there is also another from symplectic cohomology to hochschild cohomology . in the case of wrapped fukaya categories of sufficiently nice manifolds ( i.e. ones with enough lagrangians ) ,",
    "both of these maps are expected to be isomorphisms , and hence hochschild homology and cohomology are isomorphic .",
    "the isomorphism between them is expected to be part of the _ calabi - yau _ structure on the wrapped fukaya category , and is sufficiently non - trivial that its existence ( in this setting ) has not yet been proved .",
