    "star - forming nuclear rings in the inner regions of early- and intermediate hubble type ( sa - sc ) galaxies are one of the key pieces to understand the transport of gas to the nuclei of galaxies and therefore how secular evolution proceeds . the basic picture of how these rings form seems well established , both theoretically and observationally , and is usually associated to the interplay between bar - driven inflow and bar resonances ( e.g. @xcite ) . a non - axisymmetric gravitational potential , nearly always due to the presence of a stellar bar or oval distortion , causes the gas to lose angular momentum and spiral in towards the nucleus .",
    "during the inflow , and because of its dissipative nature , the gas accumulates around the radii at which the stellar orbits experience dynamical resonances with the rotating bar potential . in the case of the nuclear rings discussed here",
    "this typically happens at the inner lindblad resonance .",
    "when observed in more detail , the gas enters the ring via two tightly wound spiral arms or dust lanes . at the contact points between the dust lanes and the ring , the gas becomes less turbulent , and enters the almost circular orbits delineating the ring .",
    "while it is clear that there is abundant ( molecular ) gas throughout the ring , there is some debate about how and where star formation occurs .    in this paper",
    "we present our efforts to understand the preferred model of star formation along the rings , based on sinfoni integral - field observations , of circumnuclear star - forming rings in five nearby spiral galaxies ( ngc613 , ngc1079 , ngc1300 , ngc5248 , ic1438 ) .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a more complete discussion of the full sample .     and [ feii ] as a function of time for instantaneous starburst99 models .",
    "the maximum contribution of each of the three lines occurs in distinct , yet overlapping , time episodes .",
    "we use this property to produce a more accurate age dating of the stellar clusters along the star - forming rings ( see text ) .",
    "data shown here are for models with z=0.02 , an imf slope @xmath1=2.35 , with an upper mass limit of 100 @xmath2 .",
    "models for other metallicities , imf slopes and upper mass limit show similar behaviour.-2 ]",
    "measuring the relative ages of the different stellar clusters ( i.e. hotspots ) along the ring is a difficult task .",
    "the orbital time scales in the ring are short ( e.g. a few tens of myr ) . in order to perform the age dating",
    "it is therefore imperative that one uses a tracer that it s sensitive to these time scales .",
    "the most widely used diagnostic for this purpose is the h@xmath1 emission line .",
    "there are several reasons why this line is a popular choice .",
    "first , it is an optical emission line that can be easily measured .",
    "second , its equivalent width ( ew ) decreases almost monotonically with time for an instantaneous burst ( see the starburst99 prediction , @xcite ) allowing us determine the evolution stage of a cluster depending of the ew value .",
    "the use of this emission line , however , is limited to clusters in the age range 3 to 10 myr , and therefore any inferred age differences have to be small ( few myrs ) . below 3 myr the ew of the h@xmath1 is almost constant , and above 10 myr the value is well below typical detection limits ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "an alternative approach is to make use of several spectral lines , whose emission peak at different times . in our case we use the flux of three emission lines that are prominent in the nir spectra of the star forming regions in our sample of galaxies : hei , br@xmath0 , and [ feii ] . under the assumption that the underlying bulge / disk can be considered quiescent , and that most of the emission is produced in the ring itself , line fluxes are a better probe than the ews because they require an accurate knowledge of the continuum emission not only from the hot spot itself but also the underlying bulge and/or disk , which is very hard to measure .",
    "the hei and br@xmath0 lines are both produced by photo - ionization in the vicinity of o- or b - type stars .",
    "given that the ionization energy for the hei line is higher than that of br@xmath0 , it requires the presence of hotter and more massive stars , and hence its flux falls off more rapidly after an instantaneous burst than that of the br@xmath0 line .",
    "the time range covered by these two lines is from 0 to 10 myr .",
    "larger ages can be probed with the [ feii ] line ( a tracer of fast shocks produced in supernova remnants ) whose contribution is almost constant from 3 to 35 myr , where it sharply decreases . with these three lines",
    "we are therefore able to probe ages in the range between 0 and 35 myr , which represents a good match to the expected travel time of gas and star clusters around the ring .",
    "an illustration of their evolution with time ( as predicted by starburst99 ) is presented in figure  1 .",
    "note that in the figure heii ( @xmath44686 ) has been used as a surrogate for hei , and [ feii ] ( @xmath41.26@xmath5 m ) for [ feii ] ( @xmath41.64@xmath5 m ) .",

    "the blue channel represents hei , green br@xmath0 , and red [ feii ] emission .",
    "note that - at least in the southern half of the ring - the hottest stars ( as marked by he i emission in blue ) are located immediately downstream from the contact points .",
    "in contrast , the [ feii ] emission in red occurd predominantly further along the ring , with br@xmath0 emission dominated the region in between .",
    "this map supports the _",
    "pearls on a string _ scenario , where star formation is triggered at the odrs , forms stellar clusters than then age passively along their orbit .",

    "this map supports the _ pearls on a string _ scenario , where star formation is triggered at the odrs , forms stellar clusters than then age passively along their orbit .",
    "figure from @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "in figure  2 we illustrate two plausible mechanisms that describe how star - formation proceeds along the cirnumnuclear rings . in the first scenario ,",
    "the _ popcorn _ model , gas enters the ring and accumulates around it with no preferred location .",
    "once a critical density is reached , the gas becomes unstable to gravitational collapse and star formation is triggered . in this model ,",
    "individual hot spots collapse at random times and locations within the ring , and therefore there is no systematic age sequence . in the figure ( left plot ) the different star bursts are denoted by the star symbols and the different colors indicate different star formation epochs .",
    "in the second scenario , figure  2 ( right ) , gas enters the ring at the intersection between the bar major axis and the inner lindblad resonance .",
    "downstream from this location , a point that we will call overdensity region ( odr ) , the gas density becomes sufficiently high to ignite star formation in a short - lived burst .",
    "a young cluster formed there will continue its orbit around the ring , but star formation will cease as soon as the first supernova explosions expel the gas . a series of starbursts triggered in the odr will then produce a sequence of star clusters that enter the ring like _",
    "pearls on a string_. in this scenario , the star clusters should show a bi - polar age gradient around the ring , with the youngest clusters found close to the odr , and increasingly older cluster ages in the direction of rotation , up to the opposite odr .",
    "this is shown in the figure where the color sequence blue - green - red denotes clusters with increasing age .    in figure  3",
    "we put these two models to the test by showing the observations for ngc613 , one of the five galaxies in our sample . in the left panel",
    "we display a f666w hst image of the nuclear regions .",
    "the ring is oulined with an ellipse , and two star symbols mark the position of the odrs ( based on the regions with highest dust extinction in the ring ) . in the right panel",
    "we present a false - color image constructed from the sinfoni emission line maps of hei , br@xmath0 , and [ feii ] assigned to the blue , green , and red color channels , respectively .",
    "the bottom half of the ring shows the trends expected under the _ pearls on a string _ picture : an age sequence ( blue - green - red ) in the different hotspots .",
    "the sequence is less obvious in the top part of the ring due to the strong interaction between the ring and the presence of a well - known radio jet @xcite . in the whole sample ,",
    "not shown here , three out of five galaxies show some evidence for an age gradient of hot spots along the ring , while the remaining two galaxies have incomplete information and thus are consistent with either model .    at this point",
    "our results are not totally conclusive , although they favour the _",
    "pearls on a string _ model .",
    "larger samples are needed to shed more light on this issue . nevertheless , as demonstrated in this contribution , the proposed method of using nir line ratios to estimate relative ages of young star clusters is a very powerful tool for this purpose.-2"
