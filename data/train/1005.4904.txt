    "the modern theory of complex rational maps began with the work of fatou and julia during world war i @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "their theory ( exposited well in @xcite ) shows that for @xmath0 a complex rational function of degree @xmath1 , the riemann sphere splits into two disjoint sets ( now known as the fatou and julia sets of @xmath0 ) based on the dynamics of @xmath0 . in the 1970s ,",
    "mandelbrot used computers to produce remarkable images of these sets and of the separating curves between them @xcite .",
    "mandelbrot particularly studied the julia sets of quadratic complex polynomials , and he characterized when these sets are connected ( this yielded the famous mandelbrot set ) .",
    "the early 1980s saw an explosion of research in this area , due in part to mandelbrot s work .",
    "douady and hubbard made important advances in the theory of complex polynomials , especially quadratics @xcite , @xcite . to this day",
    ", quadratic polynomials remain the best understood in this theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the work of bielefeld , fisher , and hubbard on preperiodic polynomials along with the work of poirer on periodic polynomials have greatly improved our understanding outside the quadratic case @xcite , @xcite .",
    "non - polynomial rational maps have proved more difficult to study ; most results deal only with those maps with low degree and small post - critical set ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in the 1980s ,",
    "douady and hubbard employed a procedure now know as _ mating _ to combine pairs of quadratic polynomials to produce quadratic rational maps .",
    "this would allow them to apply to rational functions their machinery for polynomials .",
    "interestingly , they found that mating some pairs of quadratic polynomials does not produce rational maps , and so the question arose as to when two quadratic polynomials are ` mateable ' .    to answer the mateablity question ,",
    "thurston considered a family of branched covering maps from the sphere to itself that topologically resemble complex rational maps .",
    "these maps became commonly referred to as thurston maps , and thurston characterized when these maps are equivalent to complex rational maps by the existence or non - existence of obstructing multicurves ( see theorem [ thm : thurston ] in this paper ) @xcite .",
    "researchers have also considered _ topological polynomials _ , which are thurston maps that behave like complex polynomials .",
    "the mateability of quadratic complex polynomials has since been solved by rees , and others have contributed to this general area @xcite",
    "@xcite @xcite .",
    "however , we remain interested in thurston s theory partially because of its implications outside of complex dynamics . in fact",
    ", the concepts in the preceding paragraph have analogues in the theory of three - manifolds .",
    "for instance , a thurston map admitting an obstruction is analogous to a compact , oriented , irreducible three - manifold having a nonperipheral incompressible torus . for more details regarding this connection ,",
    "see the survey papers of mcmullen : @xcite @xcite .",
    "thurston proved his characterization and rigidity theorem using teichmller theory , so naturally links exist there as well .",
    "much about thurston obstructions remains mysterious .",
    "while producing an obstruction for a specific example may not be difficult , no one has yet discovered an algorithm for determining the existence or non - existence of an obstructing multicurve in the general setting ( although pilgrim has found that if an obstruction exists , it must be of a canonical form ) @xcite . the berstein - levy theorem for hyperbolic topological polynomials",
    "( see theorem [ thm : levy ] ) remains the best result for the _ non_-existence of an obstruction @xcite .",
    "more recently , kameyama and pilgrim have established algebraic criteria for thurston equivalence of rational maps , but a general algorithm remains elusive @xcite @xcite .",
    "topological polynomials which admit obstructions have not seen much study .",
    "usually , researchers use thurston s characterization to topologically construct complex polynomials . however , hassinsky and pilgrim @xcite and bonk and meyer @xcite have used obstructed topological polynomials to define metrics on the sphere that are not quasisymmetric to the standard sphere",
    ". such metrics interest analysts who seek geometric criteria for quasisymmetric equivalence to the standard sphere .",
    "the motivation from this problem comes from cannon s conjecture .",
    "our main result serves as a partial converse to the berstein - levy theorem :    [ thm : main ]    suppose that a polynomial mapping scheme satisfies one of the following conditions :    1 .",
    "at least one ( non - attractor ) period of length at least two and not containing critical values , 2 .",
    "at least two ( non - attractor ) periods not containing critical values , 3 .",
    "at least two non - attractor periods both of length at least two , or 4 .",
    "at least four non - attractor periods .",
    "then this scheme is realized by a topological polynomial that is not equivalent to any complex polynomial .",
    "fortunately , new tools from the theory of self - similar groups have proved very powerful in the study of post - critically finite complex rational maps .",
    "we use these tools to prove theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "a group of automorphisms of an infinite rooted @xmath2-ary tree is said to be _ self - similar _ if the restriction of the action of any group element on the subtree below any vertex ( which is isomorphic to the entire tree ) is another element of the group .",
    "this element is called the _ restriction _ of the original group element at that vertex .",
    "equivalently : a group is self - similar if it can be generated by a finite - state automaton .    the prototypical self - similar group is the grigorchuk group , introduced in 1980 @xcite .",
    "this group is _ contracting _ ; that is , if we fix a vertex sufficiently far from the root of our tree , we will have that the mapping that takes a group element to its restriction at the fixed vertex is decreasing in terms of the wordlength of the group .",
    "grigorchuk used the contracting property to prove a variety of interesting results about his group , particularly that it exhibits what were at the time new types of growth and amenability @xcite .",
    "the study of self - similar groups grew out of the power of the techniques grigorchuk employed .    a decade after grigorchuk introduced his group , fabrykowski and gupta defined their own group with intermediate growth @xcite .",
    "bartholdi and grigorchuk studied the schreier graphs of the action of this group on the levels of the tree and found that these graphs converge to a fractal set @xcite .",
    "this work helped to inspire nekrashevych to define the limit set of a contracting self - similar group .",
    "he then related these self - similar limit sets to the fractal julia sets of complex rational maps by defining the _ iterated monodromy group _ ( @xmath3 ) of a such a map .",
    "he showed that the limit set of the @xmath3 of a rational map is homeomorphic to the map s julia set @xcite .",
    "earlier , pilgrim had also considered a monodromy action by an absolute galois group on the set of belyi polynomials @xcite .",
    "iterated monodromy groups have proved to be a rich source of interesting groups .",
    "grigorchuk and uk have studied the properties of @xmath4 , also known as the basilica group @xcite , @xcite .",
    "their work , along with a result of bartholdi and virag , shows that this group is an example of a new kind of amenability @xcite .",
    "bux and prez have studied the properties of @xmath5 and shown it to have intermediate growth like grigorchuk s group @xcite . additionally , the fabrykowsi - gupta group is , in fact , an iterated monodromy group of a cubic polynomial @xcite .",
    "recently , bartholdi and nekrashevych used the theory of self - similar groups to tackle questions of thurston equivalence and thurston obstructions @xcite . using the iterated monodromy groups of topological polynomials satisfying particular post - critical dynamics , bartholdi and nekrashevych defined a new self - similar group of actions of the pure mapping class group on these polynomials and proved that it is contracting . since the restriction map on this group leaves the thurston equivalence class invariant , the contracting property allowed them to algebraically determine the thurston equivalence class of these topological polynomials .",
    "nekrashevych continued this work to provide a description of topological polynomials and their iterated monodromy groups in terms of twisted kneading automata @xcite .",
    "these automata encode all the topological data needed to determine the thurston equivalence class of the topological polynomial . further ,",
    "every self - similar group generated by a twisted kneading automaton is isomorphic to the iterated monodromy group of some topological polynomial .",
    "this characterization allows us to translate topological and dynamical questions about these polynomials into algebraic questions which we can answer with explicit computations in these groups .",
    "we utilize this characterization of topological polynomials to prove theorem [ thm : main ] and produce many examples of obstructed topological polynomials realizing these mapping schemes .",
    "we determine whether multicurves are obstructions to a polynomial @xmath0 by considering the dehn twists about the curves as elements of the self - similar group constructed from the iterated monodromy groups of polynomials with similar post - critical dynamics to @xmath0 .",
    "if restriction map acts cyclically on these dehn twists , then the multicurve must be an obstruction .    while this result does not provide a complete categorization of mapping schemes in terms of their realizability by obstructed topological polynomials",
    ", we do discuss some aspects of mappings schemes requiring further study in order to prove such a characterization .",
    "the author thanks ilya kapovich , kevin pilgrim , sarah koch , and volodia nekrashevych for their helpful conversations .",
