    "the interest in quasi two - dimensional devices capable of manipulating waves revived with the formulation of the generalized reflection and snell s laws @xcite , which shows a possibility of tailoring the direction of reflected and transmitted waves by introducing gradient phase shifts at the interface between two media . the generalized laws of reflection and refraction have been applied for controlling the direction of transmitted and reflected waves in electromagnetism @xcite and acoustics @xcite . by appropriately varying the phase shift introduced along the metasurface between @xmath0 and @xmath1 the propagation direction of the reflected / refracted wave can be controlled .",
    "these approaches enable tailoring the energy propagation direction , but with important restrictions of the efficiency ( the amount of energy that is sent into the desired direction is smaller than the energy introduced in the system , even for lossless metasurfaces ) .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated that some additional considerations about the power conservation can be applied over the conventional generalized reflection and snell s laws for ensuring full control of electromagnetic energy flow @xcite .",
    "this advance has attracted much attention due to the possibility of dramatic improvements of conventional solutions , especially for steep reflection or transmission angles . for electromagnetic waves ,",
    "the basis of this `` second generation '' of gradient electromagnetic metasurfaces has been established and numerically verified , and reflective metasurfaces the theoretical findings have been already confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "however , it appears that the synthesis tools for acoustic metasurfaces do not benefit from the new knowledge . in the acoustic reflection scenario ,",
    "the generalized reflection law has been experimental demonstrated @xcite using labyrinthine unit cells which provide a phase - shift profile with the @xmath1 span in the reflection coefficient phase . however , in view of the results of @xcite , the performance of these designs is not optimal because significant energy is spread in unwanted directions .",
    "theoretical studies based of inhomogeneous impedance along the metasurface @xcite show the coexistence of more than one reflected wave . for perfect control of anomalous reflection or , in other words , for allowing arbitrary changes of the direction of reflected plane waves ,",
    "we need to ensure perfect steering of all the incident power into the desired direction avoiding generation of parasitic waves propagating in other directions or losses in the system .    on the other hand ,",
    "the same approach based on the generalized snell s law has been applied for the design of refractive acoustic metasurfaces @xcite .",
    "the direction of the transmitted wave is controlled by linearly modulating the local phase shift in transmission through the metasurface . for the design of unit cells ,",
    "different topologies have been used , including space - colling structures @xcite , slits filled with different density materials @xcite or straight pipes with helmholtz resonators in series @xcite .",
    "one problem addressed in the design of refractive metasurface was the required impedance matching of each meta - atom in order to obtain total transmission . in this sense , substantial improvements in the design of matched unit cell have been achieved by using tapered labyrinthine units @xcite .",
    "however , as it has been recently demonstrated for the electromagnetic scenario @xcite , by ensuring perfect matching in the microscopic design of the metasurface ( individual design of each meta - atom ) we can not obtain the proper macroscopic behavior of the metasurface .    in this work we present the foundations for the synthesis of perfect acoustic metasurfaces , overcoming the fundamental limitations of conventional designs .",
    "the study covers two different scenarios : anomalous reflection and transmission of acoustic plane waves . with the purpose of simplifying the presentation and emphasizing the novelty of this approach , in both cases",
    "the analysis starts with a comprehensive overview of the known approaches based on the generalized reflection and snell s laws . after identifying the weaknesses of current designs , we propose new methods which ensure perfect control of acoustic energy in reflection and refraction",
