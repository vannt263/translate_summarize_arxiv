    "the measurement of the @xmath0 boson mass ( @xmath1 ) is one of the most interesting precision electroweak observables . in the standard model ( sm )",
    ", the mass of the @xmath0 boson can be calculated with higher precision  @xcite than the existing measurement uncertainty  @xcite , thus providing motivation for improving the statistical and systematic uncertainties on the measurement .",
    "the comparison between the theoretical prediction and the measurement provides a stringent test of the sm and constrains beyond - standard model ( bsm ) theories .    at hadron colliders ,",
    "the mass of the @xmath0 boson is extracted from inclusively - produced @xmath0 bosons decaying to electrons or muons and the associated neutrinos . at the tevatron ,",
    "almost pure samples of such candidate events have been identified with backgrounds typically smaller than 1% .",
    "the momenta of the decay electrons and muons have been measured with a precision of @xmath2% , allowing a @xmath0 boson mass measurement with precision of 0.02%  @xcite .",
    "the calibration of the electron and muon momenta is the single most important aspect of the @xmath1 measurement . in the approximation that the @xmath0 boson undergoes a two - body decay , the distribution of the transverse momentum ( @xmath3 )  @xcite of the charged lepton has the characteristic jacobian edge at half the mass of @xmath0 boson . in practice ,",
    "electroweak radiative corrections modify the lepton @xmath3 spectrum , mainly due to the emission of photons from the decay lepton . if no correction were applied for this radiative process , the @xmath1 measurement would be biased by @xmath4  mev  @xcite  . ] .    in the first run ii measurement  @xcite of the @xmath0 boson mass ,",
    "the wgrad  @xcite and zgrad  @xcite programs were used to calculate the qed radiative correction .",
    "wgrad and zgrad are exact next - to - leading order ( nlo ) electroweak matrix element calculations of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 processes , respectively . in order to increase the precision of the qed radiative correction for the @xmath0 boson mass measurement ,",
    "higher - order calculations were used , as implemented in the horace  @xcite and photos  @xcite programs .",
    "these programs calculate the emission of multiple photons with the appropriate rates , energy and angular distributions .",
    "photos uses the exact first - order matrix element of @xmath0 and @xmath7 boson decay for the photon emission kernel . for multiphoton radiation ,",
    "photos uses an iterative solution for this kernel , developed on the basis of an exact and complete phase space parametrization .",
    "this ensures not only resummation of leading - logarithm contributions of higher orders , but the infrared region of the phase space is accurately simulated as well  @xcite .",
    "horace is a parton - level electroweak monte carlo generator for precision simulations of charged - current and neutral - current drell - yan processes .",
    "horace uses the full phase space for each radiated photon , and there is no ordering of the photons ( i.e. in angle or transverse momentum ) in multi - photon emission  @xcite .",
    "two versions of the horace program are available . the old version  @xcite implements a multi - photon emission qed parton shower algorithm for the simulation of final - state radiation ( fsr ) in the leading - logarithmic approximation , without initial - state radiation ( isr ) and without interference between isr and fsr . in this sense",
    "the old horace program is similar to the photos program , which also implements multi - photon fsr .",
    "old horace does not include full one - loop electroweak corrections , but it mimics the real radiation matrix element for the description of the photon radiation in @xmath0 and @xmath7 boson decays , in the leading - logarithmic approximation  @xcite .",
    "there is also a new horace program  @xcite , which implements multi - photon isr and fsr with interference , and also matches each photon to the exact matrix element calculation of one - loop electroweak corrections and single - photon emission  @xcite .",
    "the photos program provides a generic interface to any other event generator such that all charged leptons produced by the latter can be passed through the photos fsr algorithm .",
    "we use this feature as follows .",
    "we generate @xmath0 and @xmath7 boson events for the tevatron @xmath8 collisions at @xmath9  tev , including higher - order qcd matrix elements and qcd resummation effects , but without loops or emission of electroweak bosons .",
    "we interface these events to photos such that the events from the chain contain the qed - fsr photons added by photos .",
    "we save photons with @xmath10  mev and the events are processed with a detector simulation  @xcite to make the pseudo - data and the mass - fitting templates .    in this paper",
    "we present comparisons between the distributions and the mass - fitting results obtained from the old horace and photos programs .",
    "to make a direct comparisons between quantities sensitive to qed physics , we need to ensure that the underlying boson and lepton distributions are identical between old horace and photos . for this purpose",
    "we use the `` born '' mode of old horace to generate born - level @xmath11 and @xmath12 events , which are then processed through photos .",
    "the born mode generates these purely @xmath13 parton processes with no radiative photons .",
    "these events are compared with events from old horace run in the qed multi - photon emission fsr mode .",
    "both old horace and photos are run in the `` exponentiation '' mode .",
    "all of the events used in these comparisons have unit weights .",
    "for all generated events we make a generator - level cut on the partonic center - of - mass energy @xmath14  gev to remove the contribution of the photon pole for neutral - current events .",
    "for consistency , we also apply this cut on the charged - current events .    in fig .",
    "[ zeedistributions ] we compare the distributions for photon emission rates as well as the energy and angular distributions for the @xmath15 process . for these comparisons",
    "we consider photons with energy @xmath16 mev ; photons with lower energy than this threshold are not counted and ignored in the distributions .",

    ", the photon angular distribution shows about 10% difference at small angles , a difference that is not correlated with photon energy . as we show in sec .",

    ", we also perform a fit to the ratio of electron calorimeter energy to track momentum ( @xmath38 ) , which is used by the cdf experiment to obtain the calorimeter calibration using the electron track . in @xmath7 boson events",

    "tables  [ massdiffsphotos ] and  [ massdiffshorace ] shows the differences along with their statistical uncertainties .",
    "table  [ massdiffsphotos ] uses photos templates and is essentially identical to table  [ massdiffshorace ] which uses horace templates .",
    "the two tables provide validation that the comparison of the two pseudo - data samples does not depend on the template choice , as long as the same templates are used for the fits being compared .",

    "the statistical errors are shown .",
    "the templates and pseudo - data use 10 billion events at the generator level as the input to the detector simulation . [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we find that the qed generators old horace and photos agree with each other in the photon rates and distributions .",
    "the only noticeable difference is in the photon angular distribution for the @xmath15 process , at small angular separation from the nearest lepton .",
    "we quantify the comparison by computing relative @xmath0 and @xmath7-boson mass shifts , and find them to be consistent with @xmath39  mev within statistical uncertainties .",
    "we conclude that a systematic uncertainty of 0.7 mev would account for any differences in the fsr multi - photon emission between the horace and photos algorithms .",
