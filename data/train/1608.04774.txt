    "magnetic properties of wannier - mott excitons are extensively studied since their first observation at the adsorption edge of cu@xmath1o crystal  @xcite .",
    "recent enhanced experiments and a theoretical analysis have discovered a rich energy structure of the excitons in this crystal @xcite .",
    "fine exciton structure is mainly determined by spin properties of carriers forming the exciton states . during the last two decades ,",
    "the spin properties of exciton complexes have attracted considerable attention due to overall interest in spin physics and their possible applications in the field of spintronics  @xcite .",
    "a major part of experimental studies has been fulfilled for the iii - v heterostructures grown by the molecular beam epitaxy . in particular , the ingaas / gaas and gaas / algaas quantum wells  ( qws ) were studied due to their high quality allowing experimental observation of the fine energy structure of excitons  @xcite ( earlier works are reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in these works ,",
    "the magnetic field is applied along the growth axis and zeeman splitting of the one or several lowest states of excitons are studied using various experimental methods .",
    "the splitting , @xmath2 , is discussed in terms of exciton @xmath0-factor , @xmath3 , defined by relation : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the bohr magneton , @xmath6 is the magnetic field , and @xmath2 is the distance between exciton states active in @xmath7 and @xmath8 circular polarizations .",
    "it has been found that the exciton @xmath0-factor strongly depends on the qw width  @xcite and on the magnetic field magnitude when it exceeds several teslas  @xcite . in particular , the inversion of the exciton @xmath0-factor measured in small magnetic fields has been reported in refs .",
    "@xcite when the qw width varied from a few nm to a few tens of nm . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath0-factors in a 20-nm al@xmath9ga@xmath10as / alas multi qw structure are reported to vary in the range from @xmath11 to @xmath12 for different excited exciton states .",
    "this variation is non - monotonic in energy of the quantum - confined exciton states .",
    "the exciton @xmath0-factor variations have been attributed to the variation of the hole @xmath0-factor because the electron @xmath0-factor weakly depends on the qw width  @xcite .    the physical origin of the hole @xmath0-factor variation",
    "is supposed to be the coupling of the heavy - hole and light - hole states  @xcite .",
    "an admixture of the light - hole exciton states obeying a huge @xmath0-factor  @xcite may considerably change the heavy - hole exciton @xmath0-factor .",
    "large variation of exciton @xmath0-factor for different quantum - confined exciton states has been experimentally observed in several heterostructures with wide qws  @xcite .",
    "effect of the quantum confinement of excitons in the qws gives rise to quasiperiodic peculiarities in optical spectra corresponding to the quantization of the center - of - mass exciton motion  @xcite .",
    "for such qws , interfaces do not considerably affect magnetic properties of excitons , which remain similar to those for bulk crystal .",
    "this fact strongly simplifies theoretical analysis .",
    "the @xmath0-factor modification has been treated as the mixing of the relative motion of electron and hole in the exciton and the motion of the exciton as the whole  @xcite .",
    "the quantum confinement stronger affects the exciton states when the qw becomes narrower .",
    "theoretical analysis of excitons in such qws should consider an interplay of the square qw potential and the coulomb potential .",
    "such consideration is rather simple for the case of a relatively thin qws , which width does not exceed the exciton bohr radius ( @xmath13 nm for the gaas - based heterostructures ) .",
    "for these qws , the coulomb potential can be treated as a perturbation , compared to the quantum confinement effect  @xcite .",
    "the problem of exciton magnetic properties in qws of intermediate width ( @xmath14 nm for the gaas ) , which are suitable for many applications , is more complicate .",
    "there is no analytical solution for such qws  @xcite .    in this paper , we experimentally study zeeman splittings of several quantum - confined exciton states in the intermediate - width ingaas qws .",
    "we also provide a theory describing the zeeman splitting of the ground and excited exciton states in the qws .",
    "the theory is based on the numerical solution of the shrdinger equation for an exciton .",
    "the numerical approach is performed in two steps .",
    "first , we obtain a separate system of wave functions for the heavy - hole and light - hole exciton states and then we take into account the hh - lh coupling . the coupling of the unperturbed states is accounted according to the luttinger hamiltonian for degenerate valence band of the gaas crystal .",
    "the comparison of the calculated zeeman splittings with those found from the experimental study of exciton excited states shows convincing agreement of the obtained results .",
    "in such a way , we verify that large change of exciton @xmath0-factor with number of the exciton quantization level in the intermediate qws is really caused by the coupling of the heavy - hole and the light - hole exciton states . the good agreement with the experiment allow us to understand",
    ", which interactions are mainly contributing to the @xmath0-factor modifications .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ experiment ] , we present results of experimental study of exciton photoluminescence ( pl ) in magnetic field .",
    "these experiments are then discussed in terms of a theoretical approach described in section  [ theory ] . in section  [ modeling ] , important details of numerical solution of the the schrdinger equation are given .",
    "then we discuss a universal character of the @xmath0-factor renormalization effect for qws with different thicknesses .",
    "conclusion section sums up the main results of our study .",
    "we studied gaas / ingaas nanostructures grown by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) technique .",
    "three samples containing ingaas layers surrounded by gaas barriers have been grown .",
    "first sample , p554 , contains the qw with nominal width 95 nm and indium concentration of about 2% .",
    "the second sample , p592 , contains three spatially separated qws with the nominal widths 30 , 36 , and 41 nm and the indium concentrations 4 , 5 , and 7% , respectively . finally , the third sample , p531 , contains four separated qws ( 4 , 7 , 10 , and 12 nm with 5% of in ) . the layer thickness in all the samples has a gradient , therefore the actual width of the wide qws ( wider than 30 nm ) was determined from the microscopic modeling of the exciton spectra ( see details in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for the points on the samples where the magnetic measurements were made , the fitted values of width are 87 , 33 , 40 , and 45 nm for the 95- , 30- , 36- , and 41-nm qws , respectively .",
    "the samples were cooled down to the liquid helium temperature .    to obtain the exciton energy positions , we have measured the pl spectra of the sample rather than the reflectance spectra because of simplicity of the experimental technique and the analysis of the spectra .",
    "similar technique has been used in several publications , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the pl was excited non - resonantly using a ti - sapphire or a he - ne laser .",
    "spectral resolution of the setup was sufficiently better than the typical width of features in the pl spectra .",
    "we discuss the data for the first sample only in this section since the results are similar for all studied samples .",
    "is the pl originated from the 2s and higher hydrogen - like exciton states .",
    "[ flo : figure1 ] ]    the pl spectra were fitted with a series of lorentzian contours , as shown in figure  [ flo : figure1 ] .",
    "the small width of peaks demonstrates high quality of the sample and leaves no doubt in the spectrum interpretation .",
    "the physical origin of the peaks is the pl of the quantum confined exciton states  @xcite . due to the high radiative rate and small energy distance between the states ,",
    "the exciton thermalization is suppressed and the hot pl is observed .",
    "the feature marked by ex@xmath15 is supposed to be the pl of the excited s - like exciton states .",
    "magnetic field effects were studied in faraday configuration , i.e. , the magnetic field was parallel to the excitation axis and perpendicular to the qw plane .",

    "evolution of the circularly polarized pl spectra in the magnetic field up to 3 t is shown in figure  [ flo : figure2 ] .",
    "the left and the right part of plot represent the @xmath7 and @xmath8 polarizations , respectively .",
    "lines formed by the pl peaks are curved upwards due to a diamagnetic shift .",
    "a difference in the line shifts for @xmath7 and @xmath8 polarizations is the clear indication of the line splitting discussed below .    besides the exciton lines , several weaker spectral lines",
    "are observed , which start from energy  @xmath17ev and demonstrate almost linear behavior .",
    "these are the states originated from the excited states of exciton .",
    "similar to the 2s , 3s , etc .",
    "hydrogen states , they have greater mean electron - hole distance as compared to the ground state . hence they readily reach the so - called diamagnetic exciton limit  ( the loudon criterion  @xcite ) at relatively low magnetic field . in the diamagnetic exciton , the electron and the hole are mainly confined by the magnetic field and only a weak confinement along the magnetic field is caused by the coulomb attraction . in the limit of high magnetic field , the carriers occupy landau levels , and the transition energy exhibits linear dependence on the magnetic field .",
    "the energy interval between the ground exciton state and the point at zero tesla where landau levels meet is the experimentally observed 1s-2s distance .",
    "accurate data processing gives value of 3.2@xmath180.2mev .",

    "the pl in opposite circular polarizations exhibits clear splitting , which decreases with the exciton state number increasing and even becomes inverse for the 6-th state .",
    "the fifth state here is of particular interest as its total magnetic momentum appears to be zero , as experiment shows . in the next sections we focus on the splitting behavior and develop a theory to explain this phenomenon .",
    "we consider an exciton as a coulomb - interacting electron - hole pair .",
    "the conduction band is two - fold degenerate due to the 1/2 electron spin .",
    "the valence band in a semiconductor of the gaas type has a four - fold degenerate structure , which is described by the luttinger hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the exciton hamiltonian can be written in the basis of eigenstates of the z - projection of the hole angular momentum operator , @xmath19 :    @xmath20    in this expression , @xmath21 is the electron effective mass , @xmath22 is the free electron mass , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is the momentum operator of electron ( hole ) , and @xmath25 is the unity @xmath26 matrix .",

    "expression  ( [ full ] ) is the hamiltonian for an exciton in a qw heterostructure consisting of semiconductor layers of cubic symmetry .",
    "the schrdinger equation with hamiltonian  ( [ full ] ) can not be solved analytically in general case . in the case of a bulk semiconductor ,",
    "the valence - band - describing terms can be rearranged in two matrices : the diagonal one and small addition with both diagonal and non - diagonal elements , which can be treated as perturbation  @xcite .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian is decomposed into four independent hamiltonians .",
    "the schrdinger equation with these hamiltonians describes separately the internal electron - hole motion and the center - of - mass ( cm ) motion of the hh- and lh - excitons .",
    "resulting eigenfunctions are the plain waves for the cm - motion and the hydrogen - like functions for the relative electron - hole motion .    for an exciton in a qw , similar separation of variables",
    "is impossible even ignoring the hh - lh coupling . in particular",
    ", the introduction of cm coordinates does not separate variables along the z - axis . for a qw of an intermediate width , the consideration of a qw potential as a perturbation to the coulomb potential leads to unacceptable controversies .",
    "therefore , we have to use a numerical procedure to solve the six - dimensional problem for an electron and a hole interacting by the coulomb potential and confined in a finite - depth qw of an intermediate width .",
    "the peculiarities of studied heterostructures further complicates the problem .",
    "first , the lattice constants of inas and gaas differ , therefore the ingaas / gaas qw is strained .",
    "the strain induces a hh - lh splitting that results in a decrease of the hh - lh coupling compared to the unstrained material .",
    "second , a segregation of indium atoms during the growth process changes the average width of the qw and breaks the presumed rectangular profile of the qw potential  @xcite .",
    "we account for this effect choosing an appropriate qw width to get good correspondence of the calculated exciton energy spectrum with that obtained experimentally .",
    "we propose the numerical solution of the problem in two steps .",
    "first , we solve the schrdinger equation with the basic hamiltonian , which is the first line of hamiltonian  ( [ full ] ) .",
    "then we use the obtained wave functions as a constrained basis to compose a hamiltonian matrix and diagonalize it .    at the first step ,",
    "we make use of cylindrical symmetry of the problem with the basic hamiltonian and divide it into the problems of smaller dimensionality .",
    "in particular , the schrdinger equations for excitons with the heavy and light holes can be solved separately .",
    "the movement of exciton as a whole along the qw layer ( the xy - plane ) can be separated from the relative electron - hole motion in this plane .",
    "the corresponding schrdinger equation is readily solved with plane waves as wave functions describing the exciton cm motion in the xy - plane . introducing the cylindrical coordinates @xmath49 and @xmath50 for the xy - plain relative motion",

    ", the conserved cylindrical symmetry allows one similar wave function factorization  @xcite , which we discuss in the next section .    at the second step , we form a matrix of total hamiltonian  ( [ full ] ) using the obtained wave functions of the basic hamiltonian , @xmath55 , as a basis .",
