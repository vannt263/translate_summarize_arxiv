    "understanding the underlying mechanisms of the electronic transport properties of nanostructures in the quantum coherent regime is of great fundamental interest , and also of foremost importance for possible applications in nanoelectronics devices and quantum computing .",
    "the scanning gate microscopy ( sgm ) technique , born more than a decade ago,@xcite provides additional information about coherent transport beyond that obtained in traditional transport experiments , and has therefore attracted considerable interest .    in sgm ,",
    "the transport through a nanostructure is measured while the charged tip of an atomic force microscope ( afm ) is scanned over the sample . the tip - induced potential scatters electrons and",
    "thereby influences the sample s transport properties .",
    "one then studies how transport coefficients , for example the linear conductance through the nanostructure , depend on the position of the tip over the sample .",
    "the technique ( for a brief review see ref .  [ ] ) has been applied to quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) defined in two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) , @xcite and to a variety of other systems , including carbon nanotubes,@xcite quantum dots fabricated in various systems ( semiconductor 2degs,@xcite carbon nanotubes,@xcite semiconductor nanowires,@xcite and graphene @xcite ) , small aharonov - bohm rings,@xcite hall bars,@xcite edge channels,@xcite quantum billiards,@xcite and bilayer graphene.@xcite    recently , sgm has been extended to so - called scanning probe microscopy @xcite , where the scanning of a charged tip together with the measurements of the resulting coulomb blockade peaks energy - shifts of a one - dimensional quantum dot enables the extraction of the electronic wave - functions density profile .",
    "numerical calculations of the conductance changes as a function of the tip position in the non - perturbative case yield conductance maps closely related to the local current flow.@xcite already in the first sgm measurements on qpcs@xcite the idea was advanced that the conductance maps image the current flow .",
    "tip - induced features , such as interference fringes , were observed for qpc - tip distances below the phase coherence length , but larger than a thermal length .",
    "those patterns were attributed to the interference between electron paths scattered back to the qpc by the tip , and by an impurity within a thermal length of the tip.@xcite such interference patterns disappear for very clean samples@xcite except at very low temperatures,@xcite where the thermal length exceeds the qpc - tip distance .",
    "interestingly , the pattern for a qpc tuned to the first conductance plateau has been observed to be rather different from the one obtained when the qpc is tuned to the first step.@xcite the spacial periodicity of the interferences when the tip moves away from the qpc was expected to be half a fermi wave - length , assuming it would be due to the interference between the electron path scattered back by the tip with another one that does not visit the tip .",
    "though this is consistent with most experimental observations , recent experiments show different periodicity in different regions of the same sample@xcite and challenge this simple picture .    in the presence of strong afm probes , the interpretation of sgm data in terms of electron flow appears consistent with numerical studies of the local current density and the sgm response in qpcs @xcite . on the other hand , sgm experiments on small ring structures combined with numerical simulations",
    "@xcite have concluded that in this situation the conductance change is related to the local density of states rather than to the local current .",
    "though a generally applicable theory leading to an unambiguous and quantitative interpretation of the sgm data is still lacking , experiments continue to propose novel and interesting uses of the sgm technique . for example , while theoretical modeling suggested looking for interaction effects in the regime where the tip is very close to the qpc,@xcite experimental evidence indicates that sgm in the nonlinear transport voltage regime gives access to information about electron - electron scattering inside the sample.@xcite    in spite of the numerous measurements and theoretical investigations to be found in the literature , it is not always obvious how the now considerable quantity of data is to be interpreted .",
    "further theoretical studies of coherent transport in the presence of a local scatterer are needed to fill in the gaps of current understanding .    in a previous paper,@xcite",
    "we initiated a systematic approach to the theory of the conductance change induced by a weak local perturbation .",
    "the resulting general expressions allow one to calculate the correction to the conductance to first and second order in the perturbation caused by the tip , starting from the scattering properties and wave - functions of the unperturbed nanostructure .",
    "it was found that the first order correction is suppressed when the qpc is tuned to a conductance plateau .",
    "this explains a change in the sgm response depending on the tuning of the qpc , and is consistent with a thermal enhancement of the interference patterns proposed for a qpc tuned close to the edge of a plateau @xcite .",
    "most of the experiments performed up to date use a very strong tip - induced potential to obtain significant contrast .",
    "such a regime most likely requires higher order corrections to be considered or a non - perturbative approach .",
    "however , within the goal of investigating the electronic properties of the unperturbed sample , a perturbative approach appears as the first step towards the understanding of what is measured by non - invasive sgm , and experiments relying on weaker probes would also be desirable  as required , for example , for the recently proposed scanning probe microscopy setup@xcite .",
    "this paper provides a detailed derivation of the expressions presented in ref .  [ ] , and addresses the question of the relationship between the sgm signal and local quantities , such as the current density , by applying the general formulas to the case of the sgm response of a qpc with abrupt openings .",
    "this model is capable of reproducing quite accurately and in a controlled way the features related to the qpc conductance quantization , and , crucially , allows one to obtain expressions for the scattering wave - functions , thus making it possible to compare the sgm response to the local current density .",
    "these two quantities are directly related only if : ( i ) the qpc is tuned to a conductance plateau , and ( ii ) the symmetry of the structure is such that the wave leaving the qpc can be written as the product of a radial and an angular part , as it is for an outgoing wave from a point - like source in a clean medium .",
    "however , when the symmetry of the structure is broken by imperfections of the sample or by disorder in the neighboring 2deg , even on a plateau the sgm response is no longer given by the local current density .",
