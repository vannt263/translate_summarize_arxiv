    "chicos , the california high school cosmic ray observatory , is a large ground array of plastic scintillator detectors located at schools and universities in the los angeles , california area .",
    "siting the array in a large urban area takes advantage of existing infrastructure to power the array as well as school internet connections for data transfer .",
    "the array has been observing extensive air showers since early 2003 , with the goal of measuring the flux and arrival direction distribution for ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( above @xmath2ev in primary energy ) .",
    "the chicos array covers an area of @xmath0400 km@xmath1 with an average site - to - site spacing of approximately 2 km ( see figure [ fig : arrayshower ] ) .",
    "chicos uses thin ( @xmath5 10 cm ) plastic scintillators of area @xmath6 to measure the energy deposited in the detectors by charged particles .",
    "when a series of individual detector hits passes cuts and is considered a candidate shower event , the measured densities are used to determine the location and energy of the primary cosmic ray .",
    "the time of hits in each detector is used to determine the primary direction . to properly reconstruct the arrival direction ,",
    "it is necessary to know the shape of the shower front .",
    "furthermore , the direction and energy are correlated since a more inclined shower must traverse a greater atmospheric slant depth resulting in an `` older '' shower . since chicos is sited at an atmospheric depth of @xmath0975g / cm@xmath1 ,",
    "well beyond shower maximum , inclined showers are attenuated relative to vertical showers . in the analyses presented here , `` ground '' refers to an elevation of 250 m msl ( see figure [ fig : arrayshower]a ) .",
    "@xmath8{array.eps } & \\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{shower - geometry.eps }       \\\\ [ 0.4 cm ] \\mbox{\\bf ( a ) } & \\mbox{\\bf ( b ) } \\end{array}$ ]    in order to reconstruct ultra - high energy showers from chicos data , we have performed extensive simulations of proton - initiated showers in the energy range @xmath2 to @xmath3 ev , using the aires simulation package for extensive air showers@xcite .",
    "we present chicos - appropriate parameterizations for both the charge density , or lateral distribution function ( ldf ) , and the time distribution function ( tdf ) of ground particles in an ultra - high energy shower .",
    "these parameterizations are employed in the analysis of chicos shower data using a chi - squared minimization algorithm , giving preliminary reconstructions of energy and arrival direction for observed events above @xmath2 ev .",
    "showers in the chicos energy range typically contain @xmath9 to @xmath10 particles , and may have an density of @xmath111/m@xmath1 out to 1 km or more from the shower core .",
    "the time distribution of a typical shower , at km - scale distance from the core , is characterized by both shower curvature delay and shower time spread in the range of several microseconds .",
    "see figure [ fig : arrayshower]b for a schematic shower front and the definition of terms used to describe the shower s geometry .",
    "the chicos data acquisition system samples the amplitudes and times of scintillator signals at 12.5ns intervals .",
    "multiple hits within a shower are individually resolved . reconstructing primary energy and direction from this data",
    "requires mathematical models for both the ldf , @xmath12 , and the arrival time distribution , @xmath13 .",
    "we used version 2.6.0 of the aires extensive air - shower simulation program@xcite to simulate proton - initiated uhecr showers .",
    "hadronic interactions were modeled with qgsjet@xcite .",
    "we performed simulations at zenith angles @xmath14and primary energies @xmath15 ) = ( 18,18.5,19,19.5,20,20.5)$ ] .",
    "simulations at these energies almost always employ _ thinning _ or statistical sampling of particles .",
    "we set thinning to begin at @xmath16 , with the aires statistical weight factor set to @xmath17 .",
    "shower particles were tracked down to @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "finally , all ground particles were required to have energy @xmath20 to correspond to chicos detector thresholds .",
    "we performed 10 simulation runs at each set of shower parameters . in the analysis",
    "four categories of histograms were considered :    the number of electrons and positrons as a function of @xmath21 in 50-m bins from 100 m to 10000 m .    the number of electrons and positrons as a function of @xmath21 and @xmath22 in 50 m and 50ns bins respectively .    the same ( items 1 and 2 ) for muons ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "these histograms were averaged over the ten runs and the standard deviation of the runs was used as the uncertainty in the histogram .",
    "to model the ldf , we began with the approach of the agasa experiment , which was similar to chicos in many ways but with important differences in location and hardware .",
    "agasa used a parameterization of a modified nkg formula@xcite .",
    "thus we also began with the functional form : @xmath25 where @xmath21 is in meters and @xmath26 is in particles/@xmath27 .",
    "all parameters are potentially functions of the zenith angle @xmath28 , energy @xmath29 ( in ev ) , and species of the primary cosmic ray .",
    "note that @xmath30 is an _ effective _ molire radius allowed to vary in order to fit the shower shape subject to the energy threshold .",
    "@xmath8{ldf5.eps } & \\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{tdf2.eps }       \\\\ [ 0.4 cm ] \\mbox{\\bf ( a ) } & \\mbox{\\bf ( b ) } \\end{array}$ ]    figure  [ fig : samples ] shows the simulation with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this example shows the typical contrast between muon and electron distributions , motivating us to parameterize the distributions independently of one another . for each species , we employed an iterative process of fitting all individual histograms , fixing or partially fixing parameter values , and refitting for the remaining parameters .",
    "our final ldf parameterizations are given by equation [ eq : ldf ] with the parameters listed in table [ table : param ] .",
    "examples of these formulae are drawn as solid curves over the aires output histograms in figure [ fig : samples]a .",
    ".[table : param ] ldf parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     turning to the shower front curvature delay and the spread of arrival times , we note that there is no well - motivated and accepted model similar to the modified nkg formula",
    ". therefore a purely phenomenological model was developed .",
    "as with the lateral distribution function , muons and electrons are treated separately in our parameterizations . rather than fitting an average arrival time and spread , we model the shape of the shower with a full time distribution function for curvature time delay : @xmath33 &   \\mbox{if   $ \\delta t\\geq a$ } ;          \\\\          0 &     \\mbox{if   $ \\delta t <",
    "a$}.\\end{array } \\right . \\label{eq : tdf}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is an overall normalization constant .",
    "we find that in fact , over the chicos energy range , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 may be considered functions of @xmath38 and @xmath28 without introducing a dependence on @xmath29 .",
    "an example of the muon tdf model is shown in figure [ fig : samples]b .",
    "we are presently working to integrate the final tdf parameterization in our shower reconstruction algorithm ; it will replace a modified agasa time delay formula currently in use .",
    "the aires simulations and resulting shower parameterizations presented here are appropriate for the chicos location and instrumentation . as such , these results allow preliminary shower reconstruction ; final reconstructed energies and directions await further refinements in our treatment of individual detector response .",
    "a smaller - scale `` chiquita '' array has been deployed within chicos to build a data set for showers at energies @xmath39 to @xmath2ev ; analysis of the chiquita data is presented elsewhere in these proceedings and provides us with a test bed for the reconstruction technique and detector modeling@xcite . in analyses of chiquita showers",
    "we have also performed limited comparisons of aires outputs with the results of the corsika simulation package@xcite , finding good agreement between the two .",
    "we thank s. ligocki for recent work on shower analysis software . we thank los alamos national laboratory for donation of scintillator detectors , and ibm for donation of computer equipment .",
    "we acknowledge support from the national science foundation , the weingart foundation , and the california institute of technology ."
