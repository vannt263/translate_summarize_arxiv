    "a system of relativistic particles can be quantized as a constrained system by using the auxiliary field formalism ( also known as einbein field formalism ) to get rid of the square root term in the lagrangian @xcite . applied to the qcd lagrangian",
    ", this technique yields hamiltonians for mesons or baryons @xmath0 depending on auxiliary fields @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the way of removing these fields for physical applications is not well defined and can lead to ambiguities . in practice ,",
    "these fields , representing for instance the energy density for the particles , are finally treated as @xmath2-number and determined from the minimum energy conditions @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an eigenvalue of @xmath0 .",
    "when the interaction @xmath5 between particles does not depend on @xmath1 , the values of @xmath1 which minimize the hamiltonian operator @xmath0 ( and not @xmath4 ) are @xmath6 .",
    "the eigenvalue equation reduces then to a spinless salpeter equation with the potential @xmath5 .",
    "so , in this case , the auxiliary field formalism can be considered as an approximation of the spinless salpeter equation @xcite .",
    "although handling a relativistic expression for the kinetic energy term is not a serious problem with nowadays numerical algorithms , a nonrelativistic expression is always simpler , specially for many body calculations . in a sense",
    "the auxiliary field formalism simulates a relativistic expression with the simplicity of a nonrelativistic one .",
    "the price to pay is a further minimization on eigenenergies .",
    "the values of @xmath1 are generally different for various radial excited states and this leads to non - orthogonality among them .",
    "this is another price to pay .",
    "an aim of this paper is to study whether these drawbacks are very inconvenient or not .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : sse ] , we consider the case of two identical particles interacting via a potential independent of auxiliary fields .",
    "we solve the eigenvalue equations for hamiltonians written in the auxiliary field formalism and for corresponding hamiltonians in spinless salpeter equations .",
    "then , we compare the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for these two approaches and discuss the problem of non - orthogonality . the study is first made for a toy model where most of the results are analytical and then in a more realistic one which relies on a precise numerical treatment .",
    "it is now believed that the color field between a quark and an antiquark in a meson can be approximated by a rigid string , carrying both energy and angular momentum .",
    "some years ago , a phenomenological model taking into account this particular string dynamics has been developed : the relativistic flux tube model @xcite .",
    "the classical equations of motion take the form of a coupled system of nonlinear equations in which a particular quantity is introduced , the transverse velocity of the ends of the string , where the particles are located .",
    "more recently , a lagrangian for a rotating string was derived from the qcd lagrangian @xcite . adopting a simple straight line ansatz for the string ,",
    "another coupled system of nonlinear equations was obtained , containing auxiliary functions for the particle energy density and the string energy density @xcite . in this case , the potential does depend on the auxiliary fields . in sec .",
    "[ sec : string ] , we show that these two approaches are exactly the same , provided all auxiliary functions are correctly eliminated from the rotating string hamiltonian .",
    "in the formalism of auxiliary fields , the hamiltonian @xmath7 for two particles with the same mass @xmath8 , interacting via a potential @xmath5 which does not depend on @xmath9 , is written @xcite ( @xmath10 ) @xmath11 the philosophy of this formalism is to keep the simplicity of the nonrelativistic form of the kinetic energy operator , to get the eigenenergies in terms of auxiliary fields , and to get rid of them through a minimization procedure .    as mentioned , the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this hamiltonian depends on @xmath9 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the orbital angular momentum and @xmath14 ( 0 , 1 , the vibrational quantum number .",
    "the physical solutions are obtained by choosing for each eigenstate the value of @xmath9 which minimizes its energy .",
    "we will note @xmath15 the value of @xmath9 minimizing the eigenvalue @xmath16 .",
    "the following notations will be used @xmath17 applying the hellmann - feynman theorem @xcite to @xmath7 , we find @xmath18 it follows immediately that @xmath19 and that @xmath20 applied to @xmath7 , the virial theorem yields @xmath21 . if the potential v is a homogeneous function of @xmath22 of degree @xmath23 , the formula  ( [ hftheo3 ] ) can be simplified .",
    "we have then @xmath24    the scalar product @xmath25 is proportional to @xmath26 because of the orthogonality of the spherical harmonics .",
    "but , for a fixed value of @xmath13 , two eigenstates with different values of @xmath14 are not orthogonal since they are characterized by different values of @xmath9 .",
    "so , it is interesting to compute the quantity which measures the overlap of two states @xmath27 we have obviously @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and we can expect that @xmath30 .",
    "another way of dealing with auxiliary field is to minimize not the eigenvalues but the hamiltonian operator itself and impose the condition @xmath31 , @xmath9 being considered as an operator by its own . in the case of hamiltonian  ( [ hn ] ) , it is easy to determine that the value of the auxiliary field @xmath9 which realizes this condition is @xmath32 .",
    "the minimal hamiltonian  ( [ hn ] ) then becomes @xmath33 which is simply a spinless salpeter hamiltonian with the same potential @xmath5 .",
    "we note its eigenvalues and eigenstates by @xmath34 it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , that we always have @xmath35 .",
    "if the two ways of treating the auxiliary field were expected to be very similar , one sees that the first method simulates the effect of a relativistic kinetic energy term with a nonrelativistic one ; the potential is kept unchanged .",
    "the differences @xmath36 give an indication on the quality of this procedure .",
    "since the minimal energy eigenvalues of @xmath7 are upper bound of the eigenvalues of @xmath37 and since these two hamiltonians have in some sense the same physical content , their corresponding eigenstates must be very similar . by computing the overlap @xmath38",
    "we can expect that @xmath39 .    if we define @xmath40 we can also expect that @xmath41 , because of the relation  ( [ hftheo2 ] ) . in both models ,",
    "@xmath8 is sometimes considered as the current mass , and @xmath42 or @xmath15 are then interpreted as the constituent mass , which , in this formalism , is state dependent .",
    "for two massless particles , the relativistic virial theorem @xcite yields @xmath43 . if the potential v is a homogeneous function of @xmath22 of degree @xmath23 , new relations can be written .",
    "we have then @xmath44    when the mass @xmath8 increases , the differences existing between the two approaches @xmath7 and @xmath37 tend to vanish and @xmath45 for all values of quantum numbers .",
    "in order to quantify these differences , we will study two models containing a confining potential , which is the relevant kind of interaction for the hadronic physics .",
    "in particular , we will focus our attention on the case @xmath46 , for which we expect the largest discrepancies between the two approaches .",
    "we first consider a  toy model \" for which most of the calculations are analytical .",
    "let us choose @xmath47 and @xmath46 . in this case",
    ", @xmath7 is a harmonic oscillator hamiltonian .",
    "its solutions are well - known and we have @xmath48 the regularized radial part of the wave function is noted @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the usual radial harmonic oscillator wave function and where dimensioned factors ensure that the eigenstates @xmath51 are normalized .",
    "the values of the parameter @xmath9 minimizing the energies are given by @xmath52 and the calculation of the eigenenergies yields @xmath53 the relation @xmath54 can also be obtained directly from formula  ( [ hftheo4 ] ) .",
    "the overlap of two eigenstates can be computed easily .",
    "knowing the values of @xmath15 ,",
    "we have @xmath55 where the function @xmath56 is given , with its properties , in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath57 is independent of @xmath58 and decreases with increasing values of @xmath13 and @xmath59 .",
    "for instance , we have @xmath60 , which is the worse case .",
    "considering the states as orthogonal is thus always a good approximation .    in order to solve the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath37 for our toy model ,",
    "let us consider the following nonrelativistic hamiltonian @xmath61 solutions for @xmath62 are known @xcite .",
    "the eigenenergies are given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the @xmath65th zero of the airy function @xmath66 ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 , .",
    "the regularized and normalized radial part of the eigenvectors is written as @xcite @xmath69 let us note that we have @xmath70 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath71 is converted into the hamiltonian @xmath37 with @xmath47 and @xmath46 by the duality transformation @xmath72 , provided the parameters @xmath58 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 are related by @xmath75 @xcite . due to this relation , we have immediately the property @xmath76 in order to compare energies @xmath77 and @xmath78 given respectively by relations  ( [ tennl ] ) and ( [ tes ] ) , we can use the following approximation for the numbers @xmath64 @xcite @xmath79^{2/3}.\\ ] ] with this formula , whose error decreases when @xmath14 increases , relation  ( [ tes ] ) can be written @xmath80 so we have immediately the ratio ( independent of @xmath58 ) , @xmath81 numerically , we found that the ratio @xmath82 is around 0.944 for @xmath83 and tends rapidly towards the asymptotical value  ( [ tesrat ] ) as @xmath14 increases .    from relation  ( [ tul ] ) and the duality transformation , the regularized function of s - wave eigenvectors of @xmath37 can be obtained in the momentum space @xmath84 consequently , the quantity @xmath85 can be calculated by the following integral ( @xmath86 ) @xmath87 and we find that @xmath88 .",
    "the relation @xmath89 can also be obtained directly from formula  ( [ virial ] ) .",
    "since the fourier transform of a harmonic oscillator is also a harmonic oscillator ( with a phase factor ) , the overlap @xmath90 can be computed in the momentum space .",
    "we obtain @xmath91 ^ 2,\\ ] ] which is independent of @xmath58 .",
    "we have checked numerically that @xmath92 and that @xmath90 decreases monotonically when @xmath14 increases .",
    "for instance , @xmath93 .",
    "one sees that , when @xmath14 increases , the eigenvalues for the two formalisms are almost the same ( to within 6% ) , whereas the corresponding wave functions can differ appreciably .",
    "the previous toy model was interesting because most of the quantities can be calculated analytically .",
    "however , it lacks some physics .",
    "first the real confining potential is more alike a linear one , and second there exist one gluon exchange contributions which add a coulombic term , important at short distance . in order to stick more to the true physical situation ,",
    "we switch , in this section , to a more realistic model .",
    "of course , this study needs a complete numerical treatment .    in the framework of a semirelativistic potential model ,",
    "a more realistic interaction to simulate the dynamics between a quark and an antiquark inside a meson is certainly what is called the funnel potential @xcite @xmath94 the values chosen here for the parameters @xmath95 and @xmath73 can be considered as typical .",
    "the eigenvalue equations for hamiltonians @xmath7 and @xmath37 with this potential have been numerically solved by the lagrange - mesh method @xcite .",
    "this technique is very accurate and can be implemented easily for both nonrelativistic or semirelativistic kinematics .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the quantities @xmath96 are presented , as a function of the mass @xmath8 , for the three lowest states ( 1s , 2s , 1p ) obtained with the potential  ( [ vreal ] ) . as expected , @xmath97 decreases when the quark mass increases .",
    "the corresponding curves for the quantities @xmath98 present the same profiles .",
    "thus we only present more results for the case of a vanishing quark mass which maximizes the error .    in table",
    "[ tab1 ] , some energies @xmath99 and @xmath100 are given for @xmath101 and @xmath102 , for the potential  ( [ vreal ] ) and @xmath46 . the difference @xmath103 can be quite large , around 100  mev for the ground state .",
    "it increases for increasing values of @xmath14 and decreases for increasing values of @xmath13 .",
    "the quantity @xmath42 is also given in this table ; it increases with @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 can differ from @xmath42 by several tens of mev , but the curves @xmath16 always present a flat minimum around @xmath15 .",
    "so it is not necessary to obtain a precise value of @xmath15 to obtain a good value of @xmath100 .    the overlap @xmath104 is given in table  [ tab2 ] for @xmath105 and for @xmath106 , for the potential  ( [ vreal ] ) and @xmath46 . except in the case",
    "@xmath107 , the overlap is very small .",
    "so the eigenstates @xmath108 can be considered as quasi - orthogonal .",
    "this conclusion is the same than in the toy model , and we can hope that it is a universal conclusion , valid whatever the potential @xmath5 .    in table",

    ", one can consider a string with an energy density between the quark and the antiquark .",
    "this string is itself a dynamical object . here",
    "we examine two such approaches .",
    "we first quickly present the relativistic flux tube model , which is essentially phenomenological , and then the rotating string model within the formalism of auxiliary fields , which has a more firm foundation on qcd theory .",
    "lastly , we show that these two models are completely equivalent .      in the simplest version of the relativistic flux tube model @xcite ,",

    "effective hamiltonians for hadron dynamics can be derived from the original qcd lagrangian .",
    "these hamiltonians can depend on auxiliary fields , representing for instance the quark energy density @xcite .",
    "when the interaction does not depend on these fields ( exactly or by approximation ) , it is possible to reduce the effective hamiltonian to a semirelativistic one ( spinless salpeter ) .    in the first part of this paper",
    ", we have compared the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for hamiltonians written in the auxiliary field formalism @xmath7 and for the corresponding spinless salpeter hamiltonians @xmath37 .",
    "we have only considered the case of two particles with the same mass and two different confining interaction : a  toy \" quadratic potential and a more realistic funnel potential .",
    "we have shown that the eigenvalues of @xmath7 are close to the eigenvalues of @xmath37 , but the relative differences can exceed 10% .",
    "the overlap of corresponding eigenvectors for the two approaches is generally close to unity for ground states , but it deteriorates when the vibrational quantum number increases .",
    "it appears that , if precise calculations are desired , it is better to solve directly a spinless salpeter equations : accurate numerical techniques exist for two - body @xcite , and many - body @xcite problems .",
    "hamiltonians with auxiliary fields can be useful if one searches to obtain analytical results , as it is the case in ref .",
    "the non - orthogonality resulting in this formalism is not a serious problem , the radial excited states being quasi - orthogonal .",
    "the phenomenological semirelativistic flux tube hamiltonian has been developed in order to take into account the string dynamics in a meson @xcite .",
    "another model derived from the qcd lagrangian , the rotating string , has been more recently developed @xcite .",
    "but the rotating string hamiltonian depends on auxiliary fields .    in the second part of this paper",
    ", we have shown that the classical equations of motion of the rotating string reduce exactly to the classical equations of motion of the semirelativistic flux tube , provided all auxiliary fields are correctly eliminated .",
    "the complete equivalence of both models has two virtues : to provide a natural interpretation of the auxiliary field in term of the transverse velocity and to reinforce the relevance of the relativistic flux tube model ( which was considered up to now as a phenomenological one ) , since it is equivalent to a model based on firm qcd grounds .",
    "the set of coupled equations for these two models are very complicated to solve numerically @xcite .",
    "the difficulties are essentially the same for both approaches , with the supplementary necessity to perform a minimization within the rotating string formalism in order to determine the value of the auxiliary field for the quark energy density .",
    "it is then more interesting to work directly with the semirelativistic flux tube model .",
