    "fusion rules play a very important role in conformal field theory @xcite , in the representation theory of vertex operator algebras @xcite , and in quite a few other areas .",
    "for example , fusion rules were used in @xcite to obtain information on d - brane charge groups in string theory which on the other hand correspond to certain twisted k - groups .",
    "this line of research found a mathematical culmination in the theorem by freed , hopkins and teleman @xcite , showing that twisted equivariant k - theory can be identified with a fusion ring . in @xcite a connection was found between the fusion rules for the virasoro minimal models and elementary abelian @xmath0-groups .",
    "further work in @xcite extended this idea to find a connection between the fusion rules for type @xmath1 and @xmath2 on all levels , and elementary abelian @xmath0-groups and @xmath3-groups .",
    "this was extended as far as was possible in @xcite to the case of @xmath4 for any rank @xmath5 and any level .    in @xcite",
    "an introduction was given to the subject with major focus on the algorithmic aspects of computing fusion rules for affine kac - moody algebras .",
    "in particular , it was emphasized that the kac - walton algorithm @xcite for fusion coefficients is closely related to the racah - speiser algorithm for tensor product decompositions , which was the subject of earlier work @xcite .",
    "@xcite included a conjecture on fusion coefficients which restates the frenkel - zhu theorem @xcite in a form which shows it to be a beautful generalization of the classical parasarathy - ranga rao - varadarajan tensor product theorem @xcite .",
    "that conjecture had already been made by walton @xcite in 1994 , but we believe that it has not been proven up until now .",
    "an outline of the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "we give the definition of a fusion algebra in section two , then we give notation and background about finite dimensional simple lie algebras in section three .",
    "this includes facts about irreducible representations , contravariant hermitian forms on them , special results for @xmath6 and its representations , and projection operators . in section four",
    "we briefly give notations about affine algebras leading to the level @xmath7 fusion algebra associated with simple lie algebra @xmath8 . in section five",
    "we discuss tensor products of irreducible finite dimensional modules for @xmath8 and the prv theorem . in section six we state the frenkel - zhu fusion rule theorem , the walton conjecture ,",
    "what it says in the special case when @xmath9 , and a corollary relating fusion coefficients to tensor product multiplicities .",
    "we begin the proof of the walton conjecture by rewriting the frenkel - zhu theorem in several ways . in section seven",
    "we review the proof of the prv theorem and refine it to help find a relationship between the spaces which occur in the frenkel - zhu theorem and the walton conjecture . in section eight",
    "we put all these pieces together to finish the proof of the walton conjecture .",
    "let us begin with the definition of fusion algebra given by j. fuchs @xcite .",
    "a fusion algebra @xmath10 is a finite dimensional commutative associative algebra over @xmath11 with some basis @xmath12 so that the structure constants @xmath13 defined by @xmath14 are non - negative integers .",
    "there must be a distinguished index @xmath15 with the following properties .",
    "it is required that the matrix @xmath16 = [ n_{a , b}^\\omega]\\ ] ] satisfies @xmath17 . because @xmath18 , either @xmath19 or @xmath20 must be an order 2 permutation matrix ,",
    "that is , there is a permutation @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 write @xmath24 and call @xmath25 the conjugate of @xmath26 .",
    "use it to define the non - negative integers @xmath27 which , by commutativity and associativity of the algebra product , are completely symmetric in @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . using this",
    "we also find that @xmath31 is a multiplicative identity element in @xmath10 and @xmath32 .",
    "in this paper we are interested in the structure constants of fusion algebras that are associated to affine lie algebras .",
    "now we will introduce notations and review some basic results needed later .",
