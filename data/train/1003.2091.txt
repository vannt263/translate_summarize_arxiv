    "fracture processes in heterogeneous materials are an important technological problem that has attracted the interest of the scientific community since a long time  @xcite . due to the complex interaction between failures and the subsequent redistribution of local stresses ,",
    "the development of adequate statistical models for fracture propagation is an extremely hard and challenging undertaking .",
    "the probably most important class of approaches to the study of fracture processes is that of fiber - bundle models ( fbm s )  @xcite . despite their simplicity ,",
    "fbm s are able to describe the main processes that can lead to a propagation of fractures and eventually to a complete breakdown of real heterogeneous materials .",
    "fiber - bundle models refer to a bundle of @xmath0 parallel fibers that are clamped at both ends and stretched by a common force  @xmath1 .",
    "the fibers have a stochastic distribution of individual strength thresholds , and the different versions of fbm s that have been considered can be distinguished by their assumptions with respect to the stress redistribution after the failure of one of the fibers .",
    "the usual experimental setup considered and analyzed in the fbm literature can be described as follows : the force  @xmath1 is gradually increased from zero until the weakest fiber breaks , and the transfer of its stress to the surviving fibers may then induce an avalanche of subsequent failures .",
    "if the fiber bundle reaches an equilibrium with no further failures , the force  @xmath1 is increased again until the next fiber breaks , and this procedure is repeated up to the complete breakdown of the entire bundle .",
    "the main quantities of interest in connection with this procedure are the distribution of avalanche sizes and the ultimate strength of the fiber bundle , defined as the maximum stress  @xmath2 the system can support before it breaks down completely .",
    "an alternative but equivalent procedure is to apply a finite force  @xmath1 to the system , so that immediately all fibers with a strength threshold smaller than @xmath2 fail . the ultimate strength of the fiber bundle",
    "is then determined by the maximum @xmath2 value that does not lead to a failure of the entire system .",
    "the oldest and most well - known fbm is that where the stress of a failing fiber is distributed equally between the surviving fibers ( global load sharing , gls )  @xcite . for this model",
    ", the strength of the fiber bundle as well as the form of the avalanche - size distribution can be determined analytically  @xcite .",
    "local load sharing ( lls ) fiber - bundle models , on the other hand , are much more difficult to analyze  @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the stress of a failing fiber is only transferred locally , typically to the surviving nearest neighbors .",
    "lls models have been studied mainly via monte - carlo simulations and analytical results have only been obtained for one - dimensional models with essentially nearest - neighbor load transfer .    in most studies ,",
    "the strength thresholds of the individual fibers are assumed to be distributed according to a weibull distribution ( typically with a weibull index @xmath3 ) . for simplicity",
    ", however , uniform strength - threshold distributions ( sometimes with a finite lower cutoff ) have also been considered  @xcite .",
    "the two idealized extremes of global load sharing and of load transfer to nearest neighbors only are not adequate assumptions for most real systems .",
    "attempts have therefore been made to interpolate between gls and lls behavior  @xcite .",
    "hidalgo et al .",
    "@xcite , e.g. , assume that the stress transfer after a failure decays as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the distance from the broken fiber , and they study the failure - propagation behavior of such a system as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "a similar model ( with @xmath7 ) has been studied by curtin  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have introduced a class of failure - propagation models that can represent , in a stochastic sense , the main characteristics of realistic load - redistribution mechanisms , but are still amenable to an analytical treatment .",
    "we have applied our approach to an illustrative prototype example for cascading failure propagation in large infrastructure networks , e.g. , power grids . in particular , we have analyzed the probability of a complete system breakdown after an initial failure , and we have found that the model exhibits interesting critical dependencies on parameters that characterize the failure tolerance of the individual elements and the range of load redistribution after a failure .    in this paper , we apply our stochastic approach to the problem of fracture propagation in fiber bundles and analyze two models that interpolate between global and local stress redistribution .",
    "the first is a stochastic version of the @xmath8-model of hidalgo et al .",
    "@xcite , and the second a fiber - bundle equivalent to our prototype example of ref .",
    "we consider an experimental setup where initially all fibers carry the same stress @xmath9 and where the individual strength thresholds @xmath10 are randomly distributed according to a probability density @xmath11 that is zero for @xmath12 .",
    "we then examine the consequences of the breaking of a single fiber and concentrate on the calculation of the following quantities :    a.   the _ no - cascade probability _",
    "@xmath13 , i.e. , the probability that an initial failure does not induce any further failures ; b.   the _ breakdown probability _",

    "@xmath15 , defined as the largest @xmath16 such that @xmath17 for all @xmath18 .",
    "we note that , in contrast to most of the other fiber - bundle models , our stochastic models neglect any spatial correlations in the load transfer after a failure . the only other model , as far as we are aware of , that also uses a stochastic ( rather than a spatially correlated ) stress redistribution is that of dalton et al .",
    "@xcite , where it is assumed that the load of a failing fiber is transferred to a fixed number ( @xmath19 ) of randomly chosen surviving fibers .",
    "in addition , we use strength - threshold distributions that are truncated below the initially applied stress  @xmath9in contrast to most models studied in the fiber - bundle literature . there exist , however , a number of investigations that also consider truncated threshold distributions  @xcite , so that a direct comparison with our results can be made .    in sect .",

    "thus , the threshold distribution has to fulfill  @xmath22 for all @xmath23 .",
    "on the other hand , we are interested in a situation where already an infinitesimal increase of the external force leads  with probability one in the limit @xmath24to the breaking of exactly one fiber , and we thus require @xmath25 .    when a fiber breaks , its stress has to be taken over by the remaining intact fibers of the bundle . in our stochastic load - redistribution model",

    ", we require that the failed stress will be shared _ on average _ by the remaining intact elements , i.e. , the mean of @xmath30 has to fulfill the condition @xmath33    due to the stress increment a fiber has obtained after a failure event , its stress itself might be above its critical threshold . in general , the initially failing fiber might thus induce the failure of @xmath34 other fibers , thereby starting a failure cascade .",
    "we then assume that all overloaded fibers fail simultaneously and that their stress is again redistributed according to the rule  , where now both the pre - failure stresses  @xmath27 of each of the @xmath35 intact fibers and the stresses  @xmath29 of each of the @xmath36 failing fibers will , in general , be different random variables .",
    "if this process leads to the further overloading of @xmath37 fibers , it continues to a next cascade stage , and so on . eventually , either the bundle stabilizes again , i.e. , all fibers are stressed below their respective strength thresholds , or it breaks down completely , i.e. , all @xmath0 fibers fail .",
    "note that , in general , during the failure cascade , the load redistribution and hence the @xmath30-distribution will be modified .",
    "whereas the details of such a modification , which can depend on topological changes , are very difficult to model , one at least has to take into account one dominant effect : as the number of fibers  @xmath38 that are still intact at cascade stage  @xmath39 decreases , the mean  @xmath40 has to increase in accordance with eq .   with @xmath0 replaced by  @xmath38 .",
    "below , we will discuss how to fulfill this requirement for the chosen forms of load redistribution .      for our setup of fracture - propagation experiments",
    ", we have to truncate the distribution of strength thresholds below @xmath41 . in the literature on fiber - bundle models ,",
    "the strength thresholds  @xmath10 of the individual fibers are usually assumed to be distributed according to a weibull distribution with density @xmath42 , where mostly the weibull index  @xmath3 is used .",
    "truncation then leads to a distribution of the form @xmath43 in addition , we shall also consider uniform distributions that are truncated below the initial stress  @xmath9 : @xmath44    in sects .",

    ", however , we can achieve an approximate description of the cascade dynamics by noting the following points :    a.   the failure of a fiber leaves the stress in the majority of the intact fibers nearly unaffected , i.e. , maximally leads to changes of the order of @xmath45 .",
    "thus , along the failure cascade , the stress of the intact fibers is approximately given by the initial stress @xmath9 .",
    "b.   the remaining number of fibers always stays infinitely large and thus the number of further failures induced by a failing fiber is distributed according to a poisson distribution . c.   the interaction between different failures can be neglected , i.e. , in the case of several induced failures , the failure cascades resulting from each of these failures can be treated as being independent .    under these assumptions ,",
