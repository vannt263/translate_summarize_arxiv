    "we define a @xmath0 to be any polyhedron whose vertices and edges are exactly the vertices and edges of the cubic lattice in @xmath1 , and which forms an embedded topological surface ( or @xmath2-manifold ) in @xmath1 .",
    "( we pick fixed orthonormal coordinates on @xmath1 ; and we view the cubic lattice as a cell - complex with vertices at @xmath3 . ) it follows that cubic polyhedra are connected , non - compact and unbounded , and of course have faces that are among the square faces of the cubic lattice .",
    "note that we allow adjacent coplanar squares , and still consider them to be distinct faces of the polyhedron .",
    "a hamiltonian path in a graph ( 1-complex ) is a connected subcomplex which forms a 1-manifold and includes every vertex ( 0-cell ) of the graph . by analogy",
    ", we could describe cubic polyhedra as the `` hamiltonian surfaces '' in the 2-skeleton of the cubic lattice : they are the subcomplexes which form connected 2-manifolds including every edge of the lattice .",
    "( banchoff  @xcite used such hamiltonian surfaces in the 2-skeleton of the @xmath4-cube as examples of tight polyhedral surfaces ; for @xmath5 his example is a quotient of our cubic polyhedron @xmath6 . )    note that we do not allow the configuration consisting of two touching cube corners ( which would correspond to a pair of opposite triangular loops in the octahedron ) because such a vertex would be a nonmanifold point .",
    "given a cubic polyhedron @xmath0 , every edge in the cubic lattice is incident to two faces of @xmath0 , and we call it a or a depending on whether these faces are perpendicular or coplanar .",
    "similarly , every vertex has valence six , and we find that ( up to isometry ) there are only two possibilities for the configuration of incident squares , as shown in figure  [ typemsz ] . to see this ,",
    "consider the vertex figure of the cubic lattice , a regular octahedron .",
    "the two vertex configurations correspond to the two possible hamiltonian cycles in the 1-skeleton of this octahedron .",
    "in the first possible configuration , a ( @xmath7 ) vertex , all six incident edges are creases , alternating up and down , making the vertex indeed a ( polyhedral ) monkey - saddle . the normal vector at an @xmath7 vertex ( meaning the average of the normals to the six incident faces ) points along one of the four body - diagonals ; the monkey - saddle configuration can occur in four possible orientations .",
    "[ typemsz ]    the second configuration , a vertex , has two incident flanges , in opposite directions along a common .",
    "this configuration comes in left- and right - handed versions , which we call @xmath8 and @xmath9 vertices , respectively . the normal vector at a screw vertex points along one of the two face - diagonal lines perpendicular to the axis .",
    "there are six orientations for an @xmath8 vertex or for a @xmath9 vertex , corresponding to the choice of axis and normal lines .",
    "our problem of classifying cubic polyhedra comes down to figuring out all the ways that these vertex configurations can be fit together to fill up all of space .",
    "an uncountable number of polyhedra can be built , with surprising variety ; but there is also certain rigidity which aids our classification , culminating in our /.",
    "before giving some examples , we prove two useful lemmas which let us extend a finite configuration to a complete polyhedron .",
    "[ lem : refl ] suppose we are given compatible configurations at the vertices within a rectangular box ( which can be finite , infinite or bi - infinite in each of the coordinate directions ) .",
    "this can be extended to a complete cubic polyhedron , by repeated reflection in the sides of the box ( which are planes at half - integer coordinate values ) .",
    "the edges meeting the boundary of the box do so perpendicularly ( as do their incident faces ) no matter whether they are creases or flanges .",
    "thus the half of each such edge or face within the box reflects to the half outside ; the fact that each vertex within the box has a legal configuration means the same is true at all reflected vertices .",
    "[ lem : uniq ] given the configuration of faces along an edge @xmath10 , the configuration at either endpoint @xmath11 of that edge is determined uniquely by its type @xmath7 , @xmath8 or @xmath9 . in particular , if the vertex configurations at the ends of @xmath10 are @xmath7 and @xmath7 , or @xmath8 and @xmath9 , then these configurations are mirror images of each other .",
    "if @xmath10 is a flange , then its vertices must be screws with axis along @xmath10 , which ( together with the flange normal ) fixes their orientation .",
    "if @xmath10 is a crease , then there are four possible orientations of that crease .",
    "if @xmath11 is type @xmath7 , it has four possible orientations ; if it is type @xmath8 ( or @xmath9 ) it has four possible orientations with axis perpendicular to @xmath10 . in any case , the possibilities correspond bijectively to the four for the crease along @xmath10 .",
    "these simple lemmas immediately give us the two symmetric cubic polyhedra shown in figure  [ symmpoly ] :    [ symmpoly ]    up to isometry , there is a unique cubic polyhedron @xmath6 with all monkey - saddle vertices , and there is a unique cubic polyhedron @xmath12 with all screw vertices whose types @xmath8 and @xmath9 alternate in checkerboard fashion .",
    "existence follows from lemma  [ lem : refl ] , starting with a single @xmath7 or @xmath8 vertex @xmath13 in a @xmath14 box .",
    "rotating the configuration at @xmath13 will just rotate the entire polyhedron .",
    "uniqueness then follows from lemma  [ lem : uniq ] , working outward from @xmath13 .    of course",
    ", @xmath6 is the infinite regular polyhedron @xmath15 as described by coxeter  @xcite , with symmetry group transitive on flags .",
    "we can view @xmath12 as a new uniform polyhedron : its faces are all regular polygons and its symmetry group acts transitively on the vertices , but the faces or edges around a vertex fall into more than one transitivity class .",
    "later we will see four more uniform examples among our cubic polyhedra .",
    "any cubic polyhedron @xmath0 has , by definition , six squares meeting at every vertex .",
    "thus it has an equal quantum @xmath16 of total gauss curvature at each vertex .",
    "the surface is an alexandrov space with curvature bounded above by zero .",
    "this negative curvature spread uniformly throughout space suggests that @xmath0 should have nontrivial topology everywhere , whether or not @xmath0 is triply periodic .    to examine this ,",
    "consider an arbitrary loop in the edges of @xmath0 ( which are the edges of the lattice ) .",
    "it can be written ( homologically ) as a sum of square ( four - edge ) loops . given a square loop @xmath17 , either @xmath17 is spanned by a square in @xmath0 and thus is trivial in @xmath18 , or @xmath17 is a closed geodesic in @xmath0 and thus ( because of the nonpositive curvature ) is nontrivial .",
    "in fact , the square loop @xmath17 is nontrivial in @xmath18 only if it is nontrivial in @xmath19 : suppose there is a compact spanning surface @xmath20 for @xmath17 within @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath20 is just the square convex hull of @xmath17 , then @xmath17 is nontrivial",
    ". otherwise @xmath20 is not contained in the convex hull of @xmath17 , so it must have an extreme point away from @xmath17 . but",
    "neither kind of vertex in a cubic polyhedron can be an extreme point .",
    "incident to any vertex @xmath11 of the cubic lattice are twelve squares , four in each of the three directions . in a cubic polyhedron @xmath0 ,",
    "independent of whether @xmath11 is a monkey - saddle or screw vertex , exactly two of the four squares in any direction are present in @xmath0 .",
    "the missing squares exhibit nontrivial loops in @xmath19 , which are thus equidistributed in space .",
    "( note that these loops are not all independent . )",
    "we note also that every cubic polyhedron @xmath0 is orientable . if not , there would necessarily be some orientation - reversing square loop .",
    "we merely need to check the nine possible @xmath21 planar diagrams ( defined below in section  [ sec : examples ] ) with a missing central square , to see that this is impossible .",
    "if a cubic polyhedron @xmath0 has orientation - preserving translational symmetry with respect to some index @xmath22 sublattice of the cubic lattice , then it projects to a compact orientable surface @xmath23 in the quotient torus ( which has volume @xmath22 ) .",
    "this surface @xmath23 has @xmath22 vertices ( with total gauss curvature @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 edges and @xmath26 faces , so it must have euler number @xmath27 and genus @xmath28 .",
    "( note , however , that there are @xmath26 missing squares within this torus .",
    "they form loops that generate @xmath29 but are clearly not independent since @xmath30 has rank only @xmath31 . )    for example , @xmath6 and @xmath12 both have translational symmetry with respect to the even integer lattice @xmath32 , with @xmath33 , so they have quotients of genus three .    we can induce a smooth constant - curvature ( hyperbolic ) metric on a cubic polyhedron , by giving each square face the metric of a square in the hyperbolic plane sized to have internal angle @xmath34 .",
    "our interest in cubic polyhedra arose from the fact that the first two examples mentioned above were reminiscent of certain classical triply - periodic minimal surfaces of schwarz ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , we expect that @xmath6 will relax to the p surface and @xmath12 to the clp surface .",
    "( see figure  [ sch ] ) .",
    "[ sch ]    we have performed numerical simulations to confirm this , using brakke s evolver  @xcite .",
    "we subdivide the faces and let the geometry relax under a flow which decreases the willmore bending energy  @xcite .",
    "( we use this rather than mean - curvature flow , since the minimal surfaces we flow towards are unstable . ) further experiments , starting from other cubic polyhedra , indicate that many , but not all , will relax to minimal surfaces in a similar way .",
    "( a typical example is shown in figure  [ minsurf1 ] ; we have used pictures like this on posters and in the first author s _ ptolemy mathcard _ series . )",
    "we plan to report on these experiments in a future paper .",
    "[ minsurf1 ]    our cubic polyhedra themselves are discrete minimal surfaces , in the sense of pinkall and polthier  @xcite . just as a smooth surface is minimal if it is critical for surface area , a triangulated surface is defined to be discrete minimal if the first variation of its area is zero , under motion of any interior vertex . for a more general polyhedral surface ,",
    "we introduce diagonals to triangulate it , and note that the condition of discrete minimality is independent of the choice of these diagonals .    given a surface @xmath0 made of squares , it is not hard to check that @xmath0 is discrete minimal at a vertex @xmath11 exactly when @xmath11 is the center of mass of the incident faces or edges .",
    "this happens whenever @xmath11 has valence six , as in our cubic polyhedra , but also for exactly one other configuration at @xmath11 : four coplanar squares . at the end of this paper",
    ", we briefly consider the calssification of this more general family of all discrete minimal surfaces within the cubic lattice .",
    "we can combine monkey - saddle and screw vertices in an astounding variety of ways . to generate a cubic polyhedron from any of the complexes in figure  [ lotsexamples ]",
    ", we can repeatedly reflect across the front and back bounding planes , and translate vertically and to the right and left .",
    "these examples are meant to suggest that the full class of cubic polyhedra is quite large and varied .",
    "we introduce some graphical notation to help discuss examples .",
    "given a cubic polyhedron @xmath0 , we use a to illustrate a slice through @xmath0 along some oriented plane @xmath35 in the cubic lattice .",
    "a planar diagram will have shaded squares corresponding to the faces of @xmath0 in @xmath35 , black edges corresponding to the faces of @xmath0 incident to @xmath35 from above , and grey edges corresponding to the faces of @xmath0 incident to @xmath35 from below .",
    "so for example , a monkey - saddle vertex will always appear ( up to congruence ) as  , and a screw vertex will appear ( up to congruence ) as either   or  , depending whether or not the axis of the vertex is normal to the plane of the diagram .",
    "figure  [ lotsexamples ] also shows planar diagrams for the examples .",
    "[ lotsexamples ]      let @xmath36 be a ( square ) face , which we think of as horizontal , in a cubic polyhedron @xmath0 .",
    "each of the four edges of @xmath36 is either a crease or a flange , but successive edges can not both be flanges , because the vertex between them would then have two perpendicular flanges .",
    "furthermore , if there are successive creases , the neighboring squares across them have to alternate up and down ( from the plane of @xmath36 ) .",
    "we deduce that a ( partial ) planar diagram in the plane of @xmath36 must look like one of the four possibilities in figure  [ partialdiag ] .",
    "[ partialdiag ]    we say that @xmath36 is a face of @xmath0 if no adjacent faces are coplanar with @xmath36 , that is , if all its edges are creases . the four adjacent faces across these creases must alternate up and down .",
    "( this is the first case in figure  [ partialdiag ] . )",
    "the complete configuration of @xmath0 in a neighborhood of @xmath36 is then given ( up to isometry ) by one of the six planar diagrams in figure  [ towerdiag ] .",
    "[ towerdiag ]    [ flangediag ]    to see this , consider how monkey - saddle and screw vertices ( whose axes must be vertical ) occur in cyclic order around @xmath36 .",
    "there are _ a priori _ six possibilities : , , , , , and , where these record the types of vertices in a slice through @xmath0 by dots on the integer lattice , with unfilled dots   for @xmath7 vertices and filled dots   for screw vertices . for each of these six possibilities , the fact that the central square @xmath36 is normal means that there is a uniquely determined configuration as in figure  [ towerdiag ] .",
    "a face @xmath36 of @xmath0 which is not normal has , among its edges , either one flange or two opposite flanges . if there is one flange , it is the horizontal axis connecting two screw vertices .",
    "the other two vertices of @xmath36 can be either monkey - saddles or screws ( with vertical axis ) ; the three resulting configurations are shown in figure  [ flangediag ] .",
    "a face @xmath36 with two ( opposite ) flanges among its edges must be in one of the last two configurations shown in figure  [ partialdiag ] .",
    "note that the second one , where each flange connects two screws of the same handedness , is the unique configuration of a face @xmath36 with two opposite creases bent to different sides :    [ lem : crease ] suppose a face @xmath36 in a cubic polyhedron has two opposite edges which are creases , and the two adjacent faces across these edges lie on opposite sides of the plane containing @xmath36 .",
    "then the other two edges of @xmath36 are flanges , and each of them is the common axis of two successive screw vertices of equal handedness .",
    "we will not illustrate the nine possible diagrams around a missing square in a cubic polyhedron .",

    "each one of these can stack vertically only to its mirror image .",
    "so @xmath39 must be generated by reflections from any of its layers .",
