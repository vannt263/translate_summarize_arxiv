    "topological defects arise whenever spontaneous symmetry breaking leads to a topologically nontrivial manifold of vacua or ground states .",
    "defect configurations involving spatially nonuniform order fields are of considerable interest in any field theory which possesses them as their topological quantum numbers distinguish them from vacua with uniform order fields .",
    "a complete understanding of the physical significance of defects requires a good knowledge of their field and energy profile and much effort has been devoted over the years to this subject ( see  @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "applications range all the way from fundamental physics to cosmology and condensed matter phase transitions .    for a symmetry breaking phase transition @xmath0 ,",
    "the vacuum manifold is given by the coset space @xmath1 , and @xmath2-dimensional defects are classified by the homotopy group @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the spatial dimensionality .",
    "for field theories with a relatively simple field content and abelian homotopy groups the associated topological defects are essentially isolated fundamental objects  they do not intersect .    in more complicated field theories",
    "new possibilities arise involving composite defects or intersecting arrays of defects .",
    "such configurations add a new layer of mathematical and physical richness .",
    "the simplest examples are @xmath2-dimensional defects whose boundaries are themselves ( @xmath5)-dimensional defects  @xcite .",
    "another example is furnished by theories with non - abelian homotopy groups , such as the quaternionic fundamental group of @xmath6 , in which topological defects of a fixed dimension ( strings ) intersect .",
    "some time ago carroll and trodden  @xcite considered the case of defects which terminate when they intersect defects of equal or higher dimensionality , such as strings ( @xmath7 ) ending on domain walls ( @xmath8 ) . the defects on which other defects end were termed _ dirichlet topological defects _ ( dtd ) , in analogy with d - branes in string theory  @xcite , extended objects on which fundamental strings can terminate .",
    "it is important , of course , to keep in mind that there are important differences between the two sets of objects , as emphasized in  @xcite .",
    "related configurations are of interest in several contexts .",
    "strings terminating on walls can arise in yang - mills theories  @xcite as well as in grand unified models , where they may be of use in tackling the monopole problem  @xcite .",
    "in nonabelian gauge theories , non - intercommuting cosmic strings provide a further example .",
    "in addition , in higher spatial dimensions , the required symmetry breaking schemes can lead to a nonabelian unbroken gauge group , and the phenomenon of confinement for the resulting defects .",
    "the rich variety of symmetry breakings and associated ground state manifolds in condensed matter systems provides a particularly concrete context to study topological defects , including the dirichlet class studied here .",
    "in fact an @xmath9 vortex filament in the nonchiral superfluid @xmath10 phase can terminate at a domain wall interface separating this phase from a superfluid @xmath11 phase  @xcite , thus realizing a string terminating on a wall .",
    "since interesting nonlinearities arise both in the cores of such defects and at the points at which distinct classes of defects intersect , it is important to have explicit solutions at hand to study , rather than simply a classification of the associated vacuum structure which guarantees their existence . some work along these lines has already been performed , particularly in the case of defects networks in supersymmetric theories  @xcite ( for related work in the context of d - branes see  @xcite ) .",
    "this is the focus of the current paper , whose outline is now provided . in section  [ wew ]",
    "we treat the case of walls ending on walls , followed in section  [ sew ] by the case of global strings ending on walls . in section  [ gsew ]",
    "we add gauge fields and treat the case of local strings terminating on walls . in each case",
    "we give explicit field and energy profiles . throughout this paper we work in three spatial dimensions .",
    "the simplest example of a dtd is a wall ending on another wall .",
    "walls are produced by the spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries .",
