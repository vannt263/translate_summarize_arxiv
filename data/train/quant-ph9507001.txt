    "the schrdinger interpretation of the wavefunction ( schrdinger 1928 , barut 1988 ) would be extremely useful if it were consistent . then quantum theory would provide a direct means to address the problem of particle structure , and an immediate route to construct generally covariant field theories founded upon analogy with classical continuum physics .",
    "of course , there are two long  standing problems that obstruct consideration of this historical proposal .",
    "firstly , quantum interactions entangle states , leading to non  separable densities in configuration space .",
    "secondly , dispersion is ever present , so that general localized solutions are unavailable ( schrdinger 1926 ) . taken together , these difficulties are insurmountable in a linear theory , and the continuum option must fail .    in this paper we show that both difficulties can be overcome within a larger theory based upon nonlinear wave  equations .",
    "for this purpose we combine : the mathematics of kibble ( 1978,1979 ) , and weinberg ( 1989 ) ; the continuum viewpoint of schrdinger ( 1928 ) ; the measurement scenario of penrose ( 1993 ) ; and the physical mechanism of environmentally induced decoherence ( zurek 1981,1982,1991 ) .",
    "the argument hinges upon exploiting the verified classical conservation laws to select an explicit quasi ",
    "classical coarse  graining ( cf .",
    "gell - mann and hartle 1993 ) .",
    "this approach is closest in spirit to bell s idea of _ beables _ ; some special class of quantities representing the reality on which laboratory observations are founded ( bell 1973 ) . here reduced one  body densities and currents are advanced to play this role .",
    "nonlinearity is then invoked to obtain a generic physical mechanism to suppress the macroscopic dispersion which would otherwise spread out the observable fields .",
    "thus nonlinearity is to assume that role now given to observers . assuming that an objective theory should be free of an external observer _ at all levels _",
    ", we are led to constrain the nonlinearity by demanding this at the _ simplest level_.    since gravitation is universally attractive , and is not directly tested at the quantum level , we focus upon it as the means to suppress dispersion .",
    "the outcome is a possible new avenue to a theory of individual events  although , for simplicity , this paper treats only newtonian gravity to secure the foundation for more general nonlinear theories .",
    "the key motivation behind this line of enquiry is the cosmological conundrum posed by quantum measurement ( bell 1981 ) .",
    "nonlinear theories offer new modes of physical interaction that do not quantum entangle .",
    "since the observer is now treated as a separable ( i.e. non  entangled ) participant in quantum mechanics , nonlinear wave  equations are an attractive option for the physical treatment of measurements ( jones 1994b ) .",
    "however , their interpretation remains problematic .",
    "this suggests that we look for a specific theory , using self  consistency and the question of measurement as guides ( jones 1995 ) .",
    "for one massive scalar particle with nonlinear gravitational self  interactions the goal of observer  free localization is achieved , and the theory is self  consistent .",
    "correspondence principle arguments are then used to obtain a many  particle theory . the gravitational wave ",
    "equation lies within the generalized dynamics of weinberg ( 1989 ) , and resembles the approximate equations of hartree ",
    "fock electromagnetism ( brown 1972 ) .",
    "quasi  classical coarse  graining plays a central role in the physical interpretation of these equations according to the continuum viewpoint of schrdinger ( 1928 ) .",
    "as soon as the initial obstructions to it are overcome one realizes that quantum field theory is perhaps open to a significant reformulation in toto .",
    "for instance , as barut ( 1990 ) has noted in his attempt to reformulate qed as a linear theory with nonlinear self  energy terms , the time  like component of a particle current need not be of definite sign if it is a _ charge density _ , and not a _",
    "probability density_. hence the dirac equation might be viewed as describing a single entity",
    ". then one might simplify the conceptual basis of quantum field theories , to free them from the shackles of perturbative method , and render them closed theories applicable to the entire cosmos .",
    "thus one may perceive already the outlines for a program of unification based upon nonlinearity , the schrdinger interpretation , and a more physical approach to quantum measurement .    since the interpretation of nonlinear theories has been a major historical stumbling block the early material , sections @xmath0 through @xmath1 , is devoted to addressing this within a continuum philosophy a l schrdinger ( 1928 ) .",
    "graining is dealt with early on , in section @xmath2 .",
    "then , in section @xmath3 , we generalize lagrangian dynamics to complex fields in configuration space . in sections @xmath4 through @xmath5",
    ", we construct the nonlinear theory of pure newtonian gravity . its relevance",
    "is then discussed in the concluding section .",
    "schrdinger ( 1928 ) , einstein ( 1956 ) , and de broglie ( 1960 ) , were each dissatisfied with the copenhagen interpretation , and sought some means to rid quantum mechanics of its reliance upon the philosophical notion of observers .",
    "one possible option they considered is to introduce nonlinearity , so that the microscopically tested superpositions are inhibited at the macroscopic level of the observing instrument .",
    "the difficulty is to locate a candidate nonlinearity , and to interpret such theories consistently .",
    "here we reconsider the continuum viewpoint espoused by schrdinger ( 1928 ) , and seek to complete his conception .    the easiest way to appreciate",
    "the historical ambiguity surrounding the interpretation of the wavefunction is to examine a _ nonlinear _ wave  equation , such as @xmath6 ( later we consider a general self ",
    "potential @xmath7 $ ] in place of the term @xmath8 ) .",
    "such equations arise frequently as the hartree ",
    "fock approximation to an interacting quantum field theory ( see e.g. , brown 1972 , kerman and koonin 1976 ) .",
    "although of practical utility , they are generally ignored in discussions of fundamental physics - -  primarily because the program of canonical quantization leads always to a linear theory ( dirac 1958)./i\\hbar = \\{f , g\\}_{\\rm pb}$ ] ( dirac 1958 ) . jones ( 1992 , 1994b ) has shown that this algebraic correspondence is incompatible with linearity .",
    "the copenhagen theory _ does not _",
    "contain its classical limit !",
    "thus we examine the physical correspondence principle afresh and look for new principles in place of the canonical method . ]",
    "most importantly , the orthodox copenhagen interpretation demands linear equations",
    ". a measurement might occur at any instant , due to the intervention of an observer . in virtue of the split , between dynamics and the observational process",
    ", one must ensure that quantum evolution preserves transition probabilities .",
    "wigner s theorem asserts that the only continuous probability preserving maps on the space of states are linear unitary ( for a recent review see jordan ( 1991 ) ) .",
    "linearity for unobserved systems is thus reconciled with  and demanded by  the postulate of a quantum jump during measurements .    to go beyond this simplistic idealized picture",
    "we need to recognize the pragmatism which lies at its root .",
    "it is a successful algorithm for conducting computations , but it ignores the physical basis of measurements . to probe coherent few  particle dynamics one must first ensure conditions of isolation",
    "this we describe by introducing a single wavefunction for the object system  neglecting the rest of the universe . however , subsequently this isolation must be broken  when a measurement is made . at this stage",
    "the theorem of wigner becomes suspended , and the collapse postulate is invoked . in practice , one is then ascending the scale from the few particles of interest to the collective behaviour of many within the measuring apparatus .",
    "therefore , it is natural to associate any breakdown of the superposition principle with emergent many  body nonlinearities .",
    "consider the quantum description of a many  body laboratory instrument , see fig .",
    "[ meas ] . through the collective evolution of its constituents it gives concrete form to information gained about the microscopic world .",
    "although copenhagen physics assumes a discrete picture of the microworld , the quasi  classical level resembles a continuum . since our sole experience of the micro ",
    "world is founded in observations at this level ( bohr 1928,1949 ) one must admit the logical possibility of a continuum foundation to all physics . given the huge gulf in scale ( @xmath9 in number ) between micro and macro physics , a continuum whole may well fluctuate ( when stong fields are involved ) to appear composed of discrete parts  the idealized point  like particles of copenhagen quantum physics .",
    "bell ( 1973 ) has sought a more objective theory through his concept of `` beables '' , some class of quantities representing the objective status of observing instruments .",
    "such beables are readily imagined as fields defined in ordinary space ",
    "time which describe the totality of the atomic world , and the observing instrument .",
    "the main conceptual problem is to recover the notion of elementary particles , as separate well  localized entities .",
    "the continuum field must appear composed of fluctuating indivisible parts , and we must ensure that any fundamental level of determinism is inaccessible to direct empirical control .    here",
    "we treat particles as an idealized concept appropriate to the _ weak  field limit _ when observable continuum fields decompose into several distinct lumps .",
    "then we may subsume copenhagen physics as an ideal case , and employ it as a known limit to guide the formulation of new equations .",
    "some immediate guidance to a viable coarse  grained continuum interpretation may be found in practical many  body equations like ( [ nlse ] ) . there",
    "the quantity @xmath10 is interpreted as denoting the density of particles in an aggregate . examining ( [ nlse ] ) , we construct the current @xmath11 and so readily verify the equation of continuity @xmath12 where @xmath13 ( provided the nonlinear self ",
    "potential @xmath14 is real  valued ) .",
    "thus we can interpret _ macroscopic _ conserved currents in two different ways .",
    "they could describe the evolution , in probability density , of very many point  like particles spread as @xmath15 , or the flow of continuum matter .",
    "recall , both born and schrdinger , each employed current conservation to defend their respective interpretations . with the ancient greeks , we may ask again : _ does nature give preference to the discrete or continuum viewpoint?_.",
    "so what are the problems with the continuum viewpoint ?",
    "firstly , the candidate for a macroscopic `` beable '' continuum field must be generated from a wave in configuration space .",
    "secondly , we must explain how a physics based upon this assumption could exhibit the discrete and stochastic behaviour we observe in quantum experiments .",
    "evidently , the key avenue into such a theory must lie within that role now played by the copenhagen observer .",
    "as soon as we drop the born interpretation something must be found in place of the observer .",
    "presently , this agent serves to connect wavefunctions with the laboratory reality .",
    "therefore , the continuum coarse  graining must effect a similar mapping from the abstract mathematics into the concrete world of observations .    since wavefunctions are generally formulated as fields on a configurational space ",
    "time , the mapping into observable fields must reduce fields in @xmath16 dimensions down to the familiar @xmath17 dimensions apparent in the laboratory .",
    "hence we conceive of an observable level whose dynamics is determined at an unobservable level , with the two levels linked by dimensional reduction .",
    "the idea is perhaps familiar already from string theory , where embarassing dimensions are compactified away , and one has the sophistication to recognize that mere mathematics is not reality , but can serve our efforts to model it .",
    "many such prescriptions are possible , so we must adopt some principle to guide the search . the avenue we take",
    "is to look for quasi ",
    "classical conservation laws , and confine attention to mappings which recover these .",
    "the rationale is clear : _ observable fields must display the observed conservation laws_.    consider , therefore , the many  body schrdinger equation for @xmath18 particles , each of mass @xmath19 . in accordance with established physics",
    "we describe these by a wavefunction @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a @xmath22vector in configuration space .",
    "the corresponding schrdinger equation reads @xmath23\\psi({\\bf x};t),\\ ] ] where @xmath7 $ ] is a general real  valued potential .",
    "higher dimensional conservation laws in configuration space are easily obtained from ( [ generic ] ) .",
    "for instance , one may form a @xmath22vector many ",
    "body current @xmath24 composed of @xmath18 different @xmath2vector partial currents @xmath25 along with the corresponding scalar density @xmath26 thus we obtain a many  body equation of continuity @xmath27 where `` @xmath28 '' denotes the natural @xmath22vector dot product .    such conservation laws would normally be introduced to discuss the joint measurement of @xmath18 particles . to do this in practice",
    "would require @xmath18 detectors , each of them composed of many particles .",
    "therefore , we put a particle picture aside , and concentrate upon how one is to describe the instrumental readout of a notional meter .",
    "the `` needle '' position is encoded jointly in the collective state of very many particles , and so a coarse  grained treatment will suffice , see again fig .",
    "[ meas ] . in classical point",
    "mechanics the mass density @xmath29 is one candidate to describe the substance of this pointer . in classical continuum physics",
    "we simply smear out each of the @xmath18 delta functions with a density @xmath30 , and integrate over configuration space . in analogy with this familiar case the quantum entanglement",
    "may be submerged from direct view by integration of the many  body density ( [ partialdensity ] ) .",
    "hence we obtain a _ reduced one  body density _ @xmath31 and the corresponding _",
    "reduced one  body current _ @xmath32 in copenhagen physics one would recognize these as describing the probability density and current for `` finding '' all @xmath18 particles at once , neglecting the correlations among them .",
    "this is exactly the kind of coarse  graining we require to describe quasi  classical instrumental readouts .",
    "further , by integration of ( [ manybody ] ) we obtain @xmath33 a _ reduced one  body equation of continuity_. hence we recover the familiar quasi  classical law of ( local ) mass conservation , without appeal to an observer .",
    "a suitable general prescription , consistent with these principles , is the familiar one ",
    "body field operator of standard many  body physics .",
    "specifically , we consider the quantities @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the many  body state , and a typical one  body operator may be written @xmath36 with @xmath37 , and @xmath38 the usual field creation and annihilation operators and @xmath39 is generally a @xmath40number distribution ( e.g. @xmath41 for momentum ) .",
    "thus we arrive at an explicit prescription for what gell  mann and hartle ( 1993 ) have referred to as a quasi  classical coarse graining of the quantum micro  reality .",
    "to complete the interpretation we advance a simple hypothesis : _ only reduced one  body quantities are directly observable  all other observations must be derived from these . _",
    "the purpose behind this postulate is to secure the foundations for a continuum theory , in which there is no need to introduce an external observer that must `` find '' the many particles which comprise a macroscopic instrumental readout .",
    "now the correspondence principle of bohr ( 1928 ) is met directly in the construction of the observable level along with the non  classical property of quantum entanglement . via coarse  graining this property becomes reconciled with our direct experience of apparently continuous quantities formulated in a @xmath17 dimensional space  time .",
    "however , unlike classical continuum physics , the dynamics of the observable fields drawn above is not determined by _ their _ values , but rather those of @xmath42 .    obviously , quantum non ",
    "separability remains important in determining the behaviour of such reduced fields , but we are free of the need to explain it within the reductionist model of particles . the quantum world is restored to a whole , although it can resemble a collection of parts whenever the quantum correlations among these are negligible .",
    "for instance , under isolated conditions , e.g. a diffuse gas , the many  body wavefunction can be well  approximated by a factored product ( brown 1972 ) @xmath43 the one  body density reduces to a simple classical sum of @xmath18 terms @xmath44 , and these behave as independent extended `` particles '' . unlike in classical physics , the indistinguishability of identical `` particles '' now follows in consequence of the fundamental hypothesis . taking a symmetrized wavefunction @xmath45;t\\right),\\ ] ] with @xmath46 denoting permutations , and",
    "sign @xmath47 for bosons , and @xmath48 for fermions , one sees that the one  body density has , in general , @xmath18 distinct lumps . in copenhagen physics",
    "different species of particle are distinguished by their quantum numbers .",
    "exact conservation laws yield exact quantum numbers ( itzykson and zuber 1985 ) .",
    "similar consideration can be applied to fields .",
    "if each coordinate @xmath49 has identical one  body conservation laws , then observation of their sum via ( [ onebodydensity ] ) will offer no means to associate any one of @xmath18 lumps with a particular coordinate .",
    "the identity of elementary field coordinates is lost by integration for observable fields whose form is invariant to permutations among these .",
    "theories of this kind afford a very natural explanation for the unrepeatable nature of quantum observations .",
    "there are many @xmath42 which generate similar one  body fields but these need not evolve identically , since it is the wavefunction which serves as the initial condition",
    ". since only reduced quantities are observable ( by hypothesis ) , the experimental conditions are inexactly reproducible , of necessity .",
    "the theory remains deterministic , but only some approximate causality is testable .",
    "this is an encouraging sign , but it remains to formulate a clear locality criterion for the dynamics of fields in configuration space . evidently , the observational requirement upon locality is that effective superluminal communication be ruled out .",
    "this demand applies at the level of the observable fields , but the usual quantum non ",
    "locality persists in non  classical correlations among observable field values at different space ",
    "time points .",
    "the position is similar to the non  local but non  communicating theory of bohm and bub ( 1966 )",
    ". we must remember that the bell inequality exclusions ( bell 1988 ) apply only to local hidden variables theories .",
    "how any physical non  locality is judged depends greatly upon our assumption of what is observable .",
    "unlike in copenhagen physics , the reduced one  body continuum fields are to describe the objective and observable state of an entire cosmos , including quantum transitions .",
    "a partial explanation for these is available via the physical mechanism of decoherence ( zurek 1981,1982,1991 ) .",
    "recall that the transition probabilities , and the basis in which a superposition is finally resolved , are explained therein by appeal to environmental effects .",
    "these wash out off  diagonal coherences in the density matrix leaving only diagonal entries in the so  called zurek `` pointer basis '' ( zurek 1981 ) .",
    "each of these appears weighted by the appropriate quantum transition probability , see fig .",
    "[ scenario](a ) .    however , it remains to locate some physical mechanism that can reduce the many diagonal entries to just one manifest outcome .",
    "here we take up a suggestion due to penrose ( 1993 ) , that a gravitational nonlinearity may resolve gross macroscopic superpositions .",
    "the idea is that , while gravitation is very weak , it is sensitive to the collective state of a very large assembly of particles .",
    "for example , a dead cat and a live cat generate very different gravitational potentials .",
    "since gravitation is a localizing force , it may intervene to choose just one lump before the situation becomes absurd .",
    "interestingly , non  entangling nonlinearities can cross  couple the diagonal entries in a decohered density matrix  _ without _ demanding any further tracing over the environment .",
    "therefore , the two ideas seem strongest when combined .",
    "we suggest a two  step scenario : probabilities fixed by decoherence , and individual events selected by a nonlinear instability , see fig .  [",
    "scenario](b ) .",
    "this scenario resembles the gravitational stochastic reduction idea of disi ( 1989 ) , except that no assumption of intrinsic quantum jumps is needed .",
    "consistent with the preceding interpretation we consider replacing many ",
    "body operator quantized fields by fields in configuration space .",
    "thus we study generalizations of the familiar linear dynamics for complex  valued fields in configuration space .",
    "one is in search of a formalism which enables the extraction of linear operators in the weak  field limit of small nonlinearity .",
    "this demand reflects the physical necessity that the structures of the present theory be recovered in an orderly manner .",
    "that is , just as the metric field introduced in general relativity subsumes the flat minkowski space metric , we must ensure that a nonlinear formalism is a _ natural _ generalization of the familiar physical structure of linear operators acting upon a hilbert space . in this way both the mathematics and physical concepts of a nonlinear theory may contract upon those of its predecessor .",
    "some guidance is provided by the previous geometrization of quantum dynamics due to kibble ( 1979 ) , along with the introduction , by weinberg ( 1989 ) , of a restriction upon the allowed hamiltonians which enforces the requisite operatorial structure . here",
    "we present a new argument to constrain a lagrangian system of dynamics , so that relativistic extension is possible ( itzykson and zuber 1985 ) .    consider a wavefunction in configuration space with @xmath18 particle coordinates , and one time coordinate .",
    "we are thus pre  occupied , at first , with a non  relativistic dynamics .",
    "we seek a prescription for such which may effectively subsume and generalize the standard one .",
    "to begin we decompose the complex field into a pair of real  valued fields @xmath50 being its real and imaginary parts .",
    "as such , we may employ understanding of the classical theory of lagrangian dynamics to obtain a nonlinear dynamics for complex fields .",
    "recognize , however , that the classical parallel is in no way reflected in physical concepts .",
    "the `` classical fields '' drawn above support no physical dimension , as they are the real and imaginary parts of a complex quantity .",
    "they are also fields in configuration space , the like of which was not encountered prior to the discovery of schrdinger dynamics .    to deal first , in isolation , with the unfamiliar aspect of configuration space consider the case of a single real  valued field , @xmath51 , and make the obvious identifications : @xmath52 ; @xmath53 ; and @xmath54 .",

    "one may perceive , in this simple observation , the magnificent opportunity to fix , once and for all , the precise form of the mathematical formalism into which all physical content must be poured . an inclusive nonlinear quantum theory must employ a generalized dynamics compatible with complex  valued fields . evidently , this must be a restriction founded within complex geometry .",

    "if this is not done , then it may happen that @xmath87 and @xmath88 are not complex conjugates of one another , in which case one would select just one pair of equations anyway .",

    "the condition ( [ compatibility ] ) is immediately satisfied by the time ",

    "a sufficient condition for the hamiltonian functional is then @xmath92}{\\delta \\psi({\\bf x};t ) } \\psi({\\bf x};t ) = \\int d^{3n}{\\bf x}\\ , \\frac{\\delta h[\\psi,\\psi^{*}]}{\\delta \\psi^{*}({\\bf x};t ) } \\psi^{*}({\\bf x};t).\\ ] ] as an example , return to ( [ nlse ] ) and observe that this equation may be derived from @xmath93 \\equiv \\int d^{3}{\\bf x}\\ , \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2 m } \\nabla_{\\bf x}\\psi^{*}({\\bf x};t)\\cdot\\nabla_{\\bf x}\\psi({\\bf x};t ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\pm\\frac{\\kappa}{2 } \\int d^{3}{\\bf x}\\int d^{3}\\tilde{{\\bf x } } \\psi^{*}({\\bf x};t)\\psi^{*}(\\tilde{{\\bf x}};t ) \\delta^{(3)}({\\bf x } -\\tilde{{\\bf x } } ) \\psi({\\bf x};t)\\psi(\\tilde{{\\bf x}};t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which certainly satisfies the complex compatibility conditions ( [ compatibilitytwo ] ) .",
    "however , such equations do not respect the scaling invariance @xmath94 that is typical of the present theory .",
    "as haag and bannier ( 1978 ) , kibble ( 1978 ) , and weinberg ( 1989 ) have suggested , this scale invariance is physically desirable in order to include separated systems properly .",
    "as later emphasized by jones ( 1994a ) , this same property is responsible for the general possibility of _ nonlinear operators _ , and thus a nonlinear spectral theory  _ i.e. quantized behaviour in a nonlinear theory_.    demanding scale invariance at the level of the action , via @xmath95 = \\lambda i[\\psi,\\psi^ { * } ] = i[\\psi,\\lambda\\psi^{*}],\\ ] ] leads directly to ( [ homogeneity ] ) , once we differentiate against @xmath96 .",
    "thus the kibble  weinberg formalism is fully characterized as the _ complex and projective hamiltonian dynamics_.    that a mathematical structure of such importance could go unrecognized for so long is surprising .",
    "however , this is surely due to the subtleties of complex geometry .",
    "the present formalism first generalizes the classical fields of one space coordinate into configuration space .",
    "this entails a change in the conceptual stand taken , but leaves the mathematics unaltered .",
    "this step complete , we proceed to restrict the lagrangian dynamics to ensure compatibility with complex numbers . at this stage",
    "one might be excused for thinking a restricted mathematics would be less frutiful .",
    "however , the demand of a complex projective structure introduces new structures that are not supported by its general embedding .",
    "the important conclusion for physics is that our demand for a fully inclusive lagrangian dynamics for complex fields has here met with a unique solution !",
    "thus we have identified the natural mathematical system an inclusive nonlinear quantum theory _ must _ employ if it is to recover past successes .",
    "it is a remarkable thing to enter upon a wider physical framework via the mathematical restriction of the now discarded classical theory .",
    "the interesting novelty of this restriction to complex fields is the natural occurrence of nonlinear operators , via the presence of non  bilinear hermitian forms . to construct these",
    "we consider ( [ homogeneity ] ) , as applied to the hamiltonian functional , and so obtain the canonical operator decomposition @xmath97 = \\int\\int d^{3n}{\\bf x}d^{3n}\\tilde{{\\bf x}}\\ , \\psi^{*}(\\tilde{{\\bf x}};t ) \\frac{\\delta^{2 } h[\\psi,\\psi^ { * } ] } { \\delta \\psi^{*}(\\tilde{{\\bf x}};t )   \\delta       \\psi({\\bf x};t)}\\psi({\\bf x};t),\\ ] ] along with the subsidiary condition @xmath98 } { \\delta \\psi^{*}({\\bf x};t ) } = \\int d^{3n}\\tilde{\\bf x}\\ , \\frac{\\delta^{2 } h[\\psi,\\psi^ { * } ] } { \\delta \\psi^{*}({\\bf x};t)\\delta \\psi(\\tilde{\\bf x};t ) } \\psi(\\tilde{\\bf x};t).\\ ] ] thus homogeneous hamiltonian functionals can always be recast in the form of generalized expectation values , where the matrix elements of the operator depend upon @xmath42 .",
    "however , at each @xmath42 these can be diagonalized using the linear spectral theory ( kreyszig 1989 ) .",
    "thus a complete set of states is available to erect a tangent hilbert space at each point on the manifold of all normalizable @xmath42 .    combining these observations with the dynamical equations ( [ wham ] )",

    "this is most interesting in connection with the spectral theory of nonlinear dynamical systems .",

    "one may verify ( [ ansatz ] ) as being an appropriate ansatz for nonlinear eigenfunctions .",
    "the recent experiments of bollinger et al .",
    "( 1989 ) yielded an upper bound of @xmath109 for the relative magnitude of nonlinear self  energy effects in freely precessing beryllium nuclei .",
    "this , and other similar null results ( for a review see bollinger et al .",
    "( 1992 ) ) , show that single ",
    "particle nonlinearities are physically uninteresting to contemplate .",
    "however , these null results do not exclude the emergent model of penrose ( 1993 ) , where quantum nonlinearity is to intrude whenever a macrosopic body , containing many particles , is split by an amplified chain of interaction with a single micro ",
    "particle into a gross superposed state .",
    "then the degree of nonlinearity felt by one particle will be subtly dependent upon the context into which it is placed , i.e. emergent effects are possible .",
    "therefore , we confine attention to the study of many  body nonlinearities , and further look to physical sources of self  interaction . among the four known physical interactions only gravitation is not directly tested at the quantum level .",
    "although it is weak , it does not screen , and so could play a decisive role in collective many  body physics . for our concern ,",
    "the main question is how quantum gravity modifies dispersion .",
    "consider a universe containing just one scalar massive neutral particle . in the linear theory dispersion",
    "will spread the wave  packet , ultimately without limit .",
    "an observer is then invoked to find the particle here , or there , from time to time ( heisenberg 1949 ) .",
    "thereafter , the observer assigns a new @xmath42 to represent his or her knowledge about the particle state .",
    "the localization achieved is thus determined by the accuracy of the measuring device .",
    "unfortunately , there is no measuring device out there to observe the universe .",
    "thus a copenhagen physicist must conceive of a _ cosmic observer _",
    ", to sit above all , and conjure from among all possibilites the histories that are , see fig .",
    "[ cosmo](a ) .",
    "necessarily , one has passed outside of physics at this point , which we prefer to avoid . in place of the observer , in place of the arbitrary selection of a cosmic initial condition",
    ", one may give preference to a theory which was explicit about what an observer is ( bell 1973 ) .",
    "ideally , we should make no presumption of sentience ( wigner 1962 ) , and so adhere to the established model of matter ruled by a few fundamental interactions , independent of consciousness .    within nonlinear theories",
    "the scope for treating interactions is much wider .",
    "for instance , via a potential @xmath110 $ ] the wavefunction of the universe experiences a separable dynamical back  reaction .",
    "such potentials may function as a non  sentient observer to achieve the necessary localization , see fig .",
    "[ cosmo](b ) . in this model",
    "all effects now attributed to the observer should be traced to nonlinear self  interactions .",
    "hence we seek to replace the copenhagen obsever by a localizing self  interaction .",
    "the options are : 1 ) strong force , 2 ) weak force , 3 ) electromagnetism , and 4 ) gravitation . among these only gravitation",
    "is not directly tested at the quantum level .",
    "it is _ universally attractive _ , and _",
    "additive_. gravitational localization grows stronger with mass  density , whereas dispersion decreases with mass . in the competition between effects that dominate at either end of this spectrum one may set a scale for the onset of emergent behaviour",
    "for the problem of one particle in an otherwise source  free universe the only interaction that is possible , and which may be plausibly invoked to achieve both of the aforementioned aims , is the gravitational self ",
    "energy due to the stress  energy of its own wavefunction .    ordinarily second ",
    "quantization is invoked to treat the physics of self  energy . however , this approach has encountered severe and persistent difficulties for gravitation . the field theory is non  renormalizable and thus unpredictive ( isham 1992 ) .",
    "as noted previously by barut ( 1990 ) , the physical effect of self  interaction can be modelled within nonlinear theories using a self ",
    "potential @xmath110 $ ]",
    ". then one need not `` second  quantize '' gauge fields in order to equip their sources with self  interaction .",
    "in place of the traditional procedure we look for a self  potential consistent with the continuum interpretation , and corresponding with the classical treatment of self  energy . the obvious choice is to take @xmath111 as the mass density for our particle .",
    "then the physical correspondence principle is met by adopting the poisson equation @xmath112 as its source . solving this we obtain the _ gravitational self",

    "the result is a non  perturbative and finite mass renormalization @xmath116 , given by @xmath117 .",
    "this choice recovers classical continuum results in a direct manner .",
    "however , it remains to incorporate this term into a wave  equation which recovers the copenhagen free  particle results when @xmath118 may be regarded as negligble relative to the wavepacket kinetic energy .",
    "this demand is met once we choose the hamiltonian functional @xmath93 = \\int \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2 m } \\nabla\\psi^{*}({\\bf x};t)\\cdot\\nabla\\psi({\\bf x};t)\\,d^{3}{\\bf x } }   \\nonumber \\\\   & &   - \\frac{gm^{2}}{2{\\cal n}[\\psi,\\psi^ { * } ] } \\int\\int \\frac{\\psi^{*}(\\tilde{\\bf x};t)\\psi^{*}({\\bf x};t )            \\psi(\\tilde{\\bf x};t )     \\psi({\\bf x};t ) } { |{\\bf x } - \\tilde{\\bf x}| } \\,d^{3}\\tilde{\\bf x } d^{3}{\\bf x } , \\label{oneparticleenergy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where scaling by @xmath119 $ ] in the second term ensures that ( [ homogeneity ] ) is satisfied . using ( [ wham ] )",
    ", we deduce the corresponding _ gravitational schrdinger equation _ @xmath120 this generalizes the free  particle wave  equation to include gravitational self ",
    "energy while ensuring that we can recover the familiar dirac formalism of linear operators upon a hilbert space via ( [ operator ] ) .",
    "also , the term @xmath121 ensures that the copenhagen rule for forming expectation values will recover the self  energy functional ( [ oneparticleenergy ] ) .",
    "the main feature of interest is the existence of a spectral theory for ( [ oneparticle ] ) which runs analogous to that for the hydrogen atom .",
    "every wavefunction fixes a self  potential , and the time ",
    "independent schrdinger equation has a complete family of eigenstates .",
    "certain wavefunctions will then be eigenstates of their own potential , and these are stationary states of the system as a whole .",
    "thus we may reinterpret quantization as a _ nonlinear eigenvalue problem _ ( cf .",
    "schrdinger 1928 ) , and trace the apparently discrete properties of nature to the existence of quantized stationary states .",
    "to obtain a consistent many  particle theory , in which gravitation remains a non  entangled observer , we look for a non  entangled treatment of mutual interaction .",
    "it must meet the correspondence principle , and allow for a consistent treatment of quantum statistics .    here",
    "we take inspiration from the hartree ",
    "fock approximation ( brown 1972 ) , which provides a very simple physical model for nonlinear mutual interactions .",
    "the method derives from a variational principle ( kerman and koonin 1976 ) , and is fully compatible with quantum statistics .",
    "it replaces the usual two  body pairwise entangling interactions by a sum of one  body non  entangling potentials . in electromagnetism",
    "the source term for these is just the one  body charge density . for electromagnetism",

    "since the one  body density ( [ onebodydensity ] ) is the source for the gravitational field this theory is consistent with the intended physical interpretation .",
    "observable fields are one  body fields , and the candidate observer monitors only these",
    ". hence we advance ( [ manybodydynamics ] ) as a plausible equation consistent with a continuum quantum theory .",

    "nevertheless , we can contrast it with the canonically quantized theory specified by the coulomb potential @xmath126 just as with many ",

    "purely spectral studies of the bulk excitations of a cold assembly of many neutral particles , such as a dense bose ",
    "einstein condensate , could arbitrate in favour of either theory .",
    "thus the _ principles _ of copenhagen physics are open to _ falsification _ via tests of the continuum alternative .",
    "the significance of this simple observation can not be overstated .",
    "since the treatment of self  energy here adopted is consistent with that employed by barut ( 1990 ) in his nonlinear self  field quantum electrodynamics , a self  consistent non  perturbative continuum quantum field theory is technically possible , see fig[forked ] .",
    "furthermore , since he found agreement with perturbative qed ( at least to @xmath127 ) , one may take the prospect of it _ being correct _ rather seriously .",

    "nevertheless , the problem of quantum gravity , and the question of quantum measurement seem always to elude a physical solution within the orthodox scheme of thought .",
    "some years ago , weinberg ( 1989 ) suggested that we look to nonlinear theories as a means to test the principle of linear superposition , the most central tenet of copenhagen quantum mechanics ( dirac 1958 ) .",
    "the stumbling block has been to locate new physical principles compatible with nonlinearity .",

    "here we have addressed the problem of interpreting nonlinear theories in a predictive scenario that is motivated by the outstanding difficulties in quantum gravity , and quantum measurement .",
    "thus we approach the construction of a nonlinear foil with clear physical problems in mind - -  we grant that the nonlinear option may be _",
    "correct_.    the resulting theory differs in its underlying principles in a clear manner : particles are to be replaced by continuum fields ; wavefunctions are interpreted objectively using the device of coarse  graining ; observers are replaced by a localizing self  interaction ; jumps are replaced by a two  step measurement scenario ; and the problem of quantized values is re  interpeted as a nonlinear eigenvalue problem .",
    "the search for new principles represents a logical game directed at locating a nonlinear theory which has at least the same level of scope and consistency as the copenhagen theory .",
    "this process led to the equation ( [ manybodydynamics ] ) , as a consistent and predictive candidate .",
    "this equation meets the two most precious demands of speculative physics : it is falsifiable ; and it is suggestive .",
