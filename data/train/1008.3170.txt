    "the principle of general covariance has had a long ( and somewhat checkered ) history in physics ( @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , this principle is often taken to mean slightly different things and it is unclear what the physical ramifications of various formulations are .",
    "@xcite contains a careful exposition of the issues surrounding this idea .",
    "here , motivated by @xcite and @xcite , we adopt the following precise definition : a lagrangian field theory is generally covariant provided ( _ i _ ) the lagrangian density is equivariant with respect to the action of spacetime diffeomorphisms , and ( _ ii _ ) all fields are variational .",
    "general covariance is of course a desirable property for a physical theory to possess , and it is quite useful when investigating classical field theories from both structural and computational points of view ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    unfortunately , there are various ways in which general covariance can fail to hold .",
    "the most obvious is that the lagrangian density @xmath0 just does not have the required behavior under changes of coordinates ; for instance , for the 1 + 1 klein  gordon equation @xmath1 with mass @xmath2 on @xmath3 , we have @xmath4 which is visibly coordinate - dependent .    a straightforward way to repair is to rewrite it as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the minkowski metric .",
    "now we have @xmath7-equivariance , but at the price of introducing the ( nonvariational ) field variable @xmath6 .",
    "this brings us to another way that a theory may fail to be generally covariant : it may contain an `` absolute '' or `` background '' object in the sense of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , in which case ( _ ii _ ) can not be satisfied . in @xmath6",
    "is an absolute object ( `` prior geometry , '' in the terminology of  17.6 of @xcite ) ; as long as @xmath6 is immutable , the theory is still not generally covariant , despite the fact that the klein  gordon equation , which now takes the form @xmath8 is certainly an invariant statement .",
    "however , if we insist that @xmath6 be dynamic , then varying it in yields @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the stress - energy - momentum tensor density of the klein  gordon field .",
    "this forces @xmath11 , so that we have produced a system which is not equivalent to that with which we started . to undo _ this _ problem",
    ", we must modify the lagrangian once again , possibly by adding in a source term for the metric @xmath6 ( e.g. , regard @xmath6 as gravity ) .",
    "but in doing so we would likely still obtain an inequivalent ( albeit consistent ) system .",
    "failing this we can not allow @xmath6 to be variational .",
    "so even in this basic example , we have two starting points based on : , which is not spacetime diffeomorphism covariant but in which all fields are variational , and , which is the other way around .",
    "thus goals ( _ i _ ) and ( _ ii _ ) are more difficult to accomplish  simultaneously  than might be expected . and @xcite , the catch is to do this while keeping all fields variational , without materially changing the theory . ]",
    "and clearly we need to be more subtle than simply `` turning background fields on . ''",
    "there are other contexts in which similar issues arise .",
    "we may have a field theory which does not have a desired covariance property ( not necessarily related to spacetime diffeomorphisms ) ; can we modify it in such as way as to attain covariance while maintaining equivalence with the original system ? a well - known example of what we have in mind is provided by gauge theory . in this case",
    "we have a lagrangian which is invariant under the action of a finite - dimensional lie group , and we would like to enlarge the invariance group to the full gauge group .",
    "this can be accomplished by means of the utiyama minimal coupling trick which , however , necessitates introducing a ( nonvariational ) connection .    in this paper",
    "we show how to solve these and similar problems by systematically introducing new _ dynamic _ fields into the formalism ; basically , subject to a few mild assumptions , we prove that _ _ we can enlarge the covariance groups of field theories as desired while leaving solution spaces essentially unchanged .",
    "_ in particular , our constructions provide a prescription for making _ any _ field theory generally covariant , as well as lead to natural derivations of both the stckelberg lagrangian and the utiyama minimal coupling trick ( conveniently understood ) as special cases .",
    "as usual in classical field theory we start with a configuration bundle @xmath12 whose sections , denoted @xmath13 , are the fields under consideration .",
    "the dimension of @xmath14 is taken to be @xmath15 , and we suppose that @xmath14 is oriented",
    ". is a genuine spacetime , but in principle it need not have a lorentzian structure ( e.g. , topological field theories ) . ]",

    "we write @xmath23 evaluated on the ( @xmath17 ) jet prolongation of a section @xmath13 , the lagrangian density becomes a function of @xmath24 , where @xmath25 for @xmath26 ; we shall abbreviate this when convenient and simply write @xmath27 .",

    "gives @xmath312 note that @xmath313 are the components of the matrix @xmath314 , and as @xmath315 is pointwise an element of the bundle @xmath316 , this expression is nothing but the identification of @xmath315 as belonging to @xmath317 corresponding to the identification @xmath318 given by @xmath319 , where @xmath320 is the lie algebra of @xmath273 .",
    "if we write @xmath259 for the variables of @xmath321 , we have finally @xmath322 on the other hand , the first jet bundle of @xmath323 is @xmath324 .",

    "we can thus drop the factor of @xmath273 in the fiber on which @xmath96 is defined and simply view @xmath327 we now notice that :    1 .",
    "the bundle @xmath317 is the bundle of connections of the principal bundle @xmath328 of which @xmath329 is an associated vector bundle .",
    "the expression @xmath330 is the covariant derivative of the field @xmath13 with respect to the connection @xmath331 .",
    "3 .   from the variational equations",
    "@xmath332 can be written @xmath333    this is the well - known _ minimal coupling _ ( or _ utiyama _ ) trick .",
    "our prescription thus transforms the @xmath273-invariant lagrangian density @xmath35 into a @xmath240-invariant lagrangian density @xmath117 by changing partial derivatives into covariant derivatives with respect to a connection .",

    "lagrange equations ( for the matter fields ) in gauge theory .",
    "some remarks are in order :    we have seen in  [ secf ] that the euler  lagrange equations of @xmath96 for the fields @xmath334 are equivalent to the euler  lagrange equations of @xmath35 for @xmath335 .",
    "this is of course still true .",
    "but if instead we consider the fields on which the modified lagrangian density depends to be @xmath259 and @xmath13 , this result no longer holds .",
    "indeed , the variational equation with respect to @xmath259 forces @xmath336 which is in general inconsistent with the dynamics of the original variational problem ( compare ) .",
    "this is why the minimal coupling trick requires the addition of a source term depending on the connection @xmath259 and its first derivatives to the lagrangian density . this term must be gauge - invariant ; while the yang  mills lagrangian density is the usual choice , a result of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) provides a characterization of all such lagrangians in term of the curvature of the connection .    on the other hand , it is amusing to wonder what would happen if we treated @xmath259 as simply a background field , and then generally covariantized the theory as in  3b ? ` second covariantization ' ?",
    "connections @xmath259 of the type @xmath314 are flat .",
    "thus the prescription we provide here is the minimal coupling trick where the new field ( the connection ) has no curvature .",
    "as the curvature is understood as the field strength of @xmath259 , this explains physically why for these connections , the euler ",
    "lagrange equations of the covariantized theory will be equivalent to those of the original theory : a gauge transformation can be used to reduce @xmath337 . @xmath79    the condition for @xmath259 ( as a section of @xmath338 ) to be flat is equivalent to the covariance field @xmath65 being a holonomic section of @xmath339 .",
    "hence we could say that the classical minimal coupling trick just takes the construction of  [ secf ] and assumes that the connection @xmath259 need not be holonomic .",
    "this can be seen , somehow , as natural because the new lagrangian density @xmath96 depends only on @xmath259 , not on @xmath65 , and hence we could ` forget ' that @xmath259 is induced by the holonomic section @xmath65 . @xmath79",
    "finally , suppose the group of @xmath238-bundle automorphisms under consideration acts neither ` horizontally ' ( as in  2 ) nor purely vertically on @xmath29 ( as in  3 ) . for instance , consider a field theory based on a trivial principal bundle @xmath340 , which is not generally covariant and which we wish to gauge .",
    "since @xmath41 acts on @xmath341 and both it and the gauge group @xmath342 can be realized as sections of bundles over @xmath14 , we may straightforwardly extend our technique to this case , regarding the group @xmath343 as sections of @xmath344 , and then covariantizing with respect to @xmath240 .",
    "the case when the relevant group @xmath240 can not be realized as sections of some bundle over @xmath14 is more complicated ; nonetheless , our constructions still work with the following adjustments . as in @xcite",
    "we `` concatenate '' @xmath345 and @xmath32 to obtain the modified configuration bundle @xmath346 .",
    "sections of this bundle will consist of pairs @xmath347 , where @xmath243 is a @xmath238-bundle automorphism and the `` fields '' @xmath348 are related to the original fields by @xmath349 .",
