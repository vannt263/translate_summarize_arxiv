    "reduced basis ( rb ) methods are effective tools for approximating the solution manifolds of parameterized evolution problems by low - dimensional linear spaces , enabling fast online evaluation of the solution for arbitrary parameter values . for linear problems ,",
    "the pod - greedy algorithm @xcite is by now an established reduction approach which has recently been proved to be optimal in the sense that exponential or algebraic convergence rates of the kolmogorov @xmath0-width are maintained by the algorithm @xcite .",
    "the approach has been further extended to nonlinear settings in @xcite based on empirical interpolation of the nonlinear operators .    for convection dominated problems with low regularity however , the performance of rb - methods is limited by the fact that translation of functions is nonlinear in the translation vector : the solution has to be approximated at every location in space it is being transported to , resulting in merely linear decay of the @xmath0-width .",
    "our aim is therefore to extend the above approaches by additionally allowing transformations of the reduced spaces given by an appropriate group action on the solution space .",
    "originally developed for the study of relative equilibria of evolution equations @xcite , the _ method of freezing _ allows us to obtain such a decomposition of the solution into a group and shape component for arbitrary lie group actions , provided they satisfy the equivariance condition ( [ equivariance ] ) . combining this method with rb - techniques , we obtain a new nonlinear reduction method for parameterized nonlinear evolution equations .",
    "assume we are given a parameter dependent nonlinear cauchy problem of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a function of space for each @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath4 is a partial differential operator acting on @xmath5 .",
    "given a lie group @xmath6 acting smoothly on @xmath5 by linear operators , we want to decompose the solution @xmath7 into a group component @xmath8 and a shape component @xmath9 such that @xmath10 here the action of @xmath6 on @xmath5 is denoted by a lower dot .",
    "as a guiding example consider the action of the lie groups @xmath11 on functions @xmath12 via translation , i.e. @xmath13 for @xmath14 . in this case , if @xmath7 is a solution of ( [ problem ] ) drifting along a certain trajectory in space , we want to find a decomposition ( [ decomp ] ) such that the drift is captured by the evolution of @xmath15 whereas @xmath16 becomes as stationary as possible , only describing the change of the shape of @xmath7 over time",
    ".    note that , in general , the group action does not have to be induced by a mapping of the underlying spatial domain ( e.g. shifts or rotations ) but can also involve more general transformations of @xmath5 .    inserting ( [ decomp ] ) into ( [ problem ] )",
    ", we formally get @xmath17 which can be rewritten as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an element of the lie algebra @xmath20 of @xmath6 , i.e. the tangential space of @xmath6 at its neutral element @xmath21 .",
    "since the decomposition ( @xmath22 ) introduces @xmath23 additional degrees of freedom , the resulting system is now underdetermined .",
    "it is the main idea of the method of freezing to compensate for these degrees of freedom by adding appropriate algebraic constraints @xmath24 which force @xmath25 to have minimal change over time .",
    "these constraints are called _",
    "phase conditions_. thus , the group component of the solution is automatically determined by the phase condition , and no a - priori knowledge of the evolution of the solution is necessary .    if one further assumes that the operator @xmath4 is _ equivariant _ under the group action , i.e. @xmath26 the system decuples into the partial differential algebraic equation ( pdae ) of index one @xmath27 with @xmath28 and the ordinary differential equation @xmath29 , called the _",

    "different choices of phase conditions are possible @xcite .",
    "we will restrict ourselves here to the so - called _ orthogonality phase condition _ : assuming that @xmath5 is equipped with an inner product , we require that the evolution of @xmath25 is at each point in time orthogonal to the action of @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath32 for all @xmath33 . inserting ( [ frozenproblem ] ) , we obtain @xmath34 after choosing a basis for @xmath20 , this leads to a linear @xmath35 equation system for @xmath19 . denoting the basis vectors by @xmath36 , this system can be written as @xmath37_{r , s } \\cdot \\bigl [ \\mathfrak{g}_{\\mu , s}(t ) \\bigr]_s      + \\bigl [ \\bigl(\\mathcal{l}_\\mu(v_\\mu(t)),\\ , \\mathfrak{e}_r\\,.\\,v_\\mu(t)\\bigr ) \\bigr]_r",

    "depending on the specific problem , many different choices of space - time discretizations of the frozen system ( [ frozenproblem ] ) are possible . to keep the notation simple , we will restrict ourselves to an explicit euler time - stepping :    [ def : frozenscheme ] let an @xmath41-dimensional space @xmath42 and discrete parameter dependent operators @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 on @xmath42 be given , approximating the operators @xmath4 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . since @xmath20 acts on @xmath5 by linear operators , we can assume that the @xmath48 are linear .",
