    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are close binary systems that consist of an accreting white dwarf ( the primary ) and a secondary component that usually resembles a main - sequence star .",
    "@xcite comprehensively reviews cvs .",
    "dwarf novae , or u geminorum stars , are a subclass of cvs that can be further subclassified based on their outburst behavior . the su ursae majoris stars ( referred to as ugsu ) form a subclass of dwarf novae that undergo occasional superoutbursts in addition to normal outbursts . superoutbursts occur less frequently than normal outbursts , but are brighter and last longer . during a superoutburst , characteristic oscillations called `` superhumps '' develop in the light curves .",
    "the measured superhump period , @xmath2 , is usually a few percent longer than the measured orbital period , @xmath3 .",
    "almost all known su uma stars have @xmath4 hr . the superhump period excess , @xmath5[(@xmath6/@xmath3 ] , is an important quantity for these stars .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that @xmath1 correlates well with the mass ratio @xmath8 , which is otherwise difficult to obtain .",
    "another class of dwarf novae are the wz sagittae stars ( ugwz ) , which are extreme examples of the su uma - type stars .",
    "wz sge stars exhibit large - amplitude outbursts ( @xmath9 6 mag ) that occur less frequently than the those of the ugsu ( @xcite ) .",
    "wz sge stars do exhibit superhumps in their light curves , but do not appear to have any ` normal ' outbursts .    here we present observations of the dwarf nova identified with the rosat x - ray source rxs j053234.9 + 624755 ( hereafter rx0532 + 62 ) .",
    "the discovery of this star , which lies in camelopardalis , is described by @xcite .",
    "@xcite classified it as a u gem - type dwarf novae with a recurrence time scale of 133 days .",
    "the relatively frequent outbursts show that this star is not a ugwz .",
    "rx0532 + 62 underwent a well - observed superoutburst in 2005 march . during this outburst a superhump period , @xmath2 , of 0.0571(2 ) d ( 82.2 mins ) was reported by tonny vanmunster ( cba belgium ) ; ] @xcite independently found a similar , but less accurate , value of @xmath10 .",
    "we undertook observations of this star to independently determine the orbital period , @xmath3 , and allow determination of the superhump period excess , @xmath1 .",
    "we took spectra using the mdm observatory 1.3 m mcgraw - hill telescope on kitt peak during two observing runs in 2005 september and 2006 january .",
    "we used the mark iii spectrograph and a thinned @xmath11 site ccd detector , with a 600 line mm@xmath12 grism that gave spectra spanning from 4500   to 7000   at 2.3   pixel@xmath12 . in all , 106 spectra of rx0532 + 62 were taken with typical exposure times of 480 s , along with frequent comparison spectra to maintain the wavelength calibration . at the beginning and end of every photometric night , we observed flux standards to determine an absolute flux calibration .",
    "table 1 gives a journal of observations .",
    "the system was in quiescence for all the observations reported here .",
    "we also obtained direct images with the mdm 2.4 m hiltner telescope . a site @xmath13 ccd with an image scale of 0.275 arcsec pixel@xmath12",
    "was used , with filters matching the johnson ubv and kron - cousins i passbands .",
    "the stars in the field were calibrated using @xcite standards .",
    "exposures were obtained while the sky appeared photometric , and the reduced images were processed using the daophot program as implemented in iraf ( @xcite ) .",
    "positions for stars in the field were derived by fitting a plate model to 39 usno a2.0 stars ( @xcite ) ; the fit had an rms error of 0.37 arcsec .",
    "table 2 shows the celestial positions , magnitudes , and colors of rx0532 + 62 and the field stars .",
    "figure 1 shows the field around rx0532 + 62 along with the measured v magnitudes .",
    "we reduced the spectra using standard iraf routines , except for the extraction of one - dimensional spectra from the two - dimensional images . for this , we used an original implementation of the optimal extraction algorithm developed by @xcite ; the primary advantage over the iraf @xmath14 routine was an improved rejection of bad pixels .",
    "the time averaged and flux - calibrated spectrum of rx0532 + 62 is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the spectrum appears typical of dwarf novae , showing strong broad emission lines .",
    "the double peaks in the emission lines imply that the orbital inclination is not too far from edge - on . to measure the emission line radial velocities we used the convolution method described by @xcite .",
    "the steep sides of the line profile were measured by convolving the line with a function consisting of positive and negative gaussians displaced by an adjustable separation .",
    "the emission lines widths and strengths were measured in the time - average spectra ; the results are given in table 3 .    to search for @xmath3 in the radial velocities",
    ", we used the `` residualgram '' method as described by @xcite .",
    "figure 3 shows the result for the 2005 september data .",
    "table 4 gives the parameters of the best sine fits of the form @xmath15 $ ] , and the rms scatter @xmath16 around the best fits .",
    "figure 4 shows the velocities folded on the period adopted from the combined ( 2005 september , 2006 january ) data , together with the best - fitting sinusoid .",
    "the 2005 september data did not unambiguously determine the correct choice of daily cycle count because of the limited hour angle coverage available early in the observing season .",
    "the 2006 january data were taken in order to resolve the ambiguity , but for unknown reasons the velocities had greater scatter than the 2005 september data .",
    "we also measured velocities of the h@xmath17 emission in an attempt to resolve the daily cycle count .",
    "the h@xmath17 velocities corroborated the h@xmath0 measurements , but the period remained ambiguous .",
    "however , we know @xmath10 , and that the @xmath3 of an su uma - type should be a few percent less than @xmath2 .",
    "this guides our choice of cycle count , which yields 0.05620(4 ) d for the 2005 september data .",
    "the run - to - run cycle count is ambiguous , but periods consistent with all the data are given by @xmath18 where the numerator is the measured interval between blue - to - red crossings of the h@xmath0 emission velocities determined from our two observing runs , and the denominator is constrained to integer values .",
    "combining our @xmath3 with the previously measured @xmath2 , we find @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite plot log(@xmath1 ) against log(@xmath20 ) for a large number of systems with hydrogen - rich secondaries . on this plot ,",
    "rx0532 + 62 lies near the short - period end , where systems appear to be evolving through the period minimum .",
    "these occupy a relatively wide range of @xmath1 values .",
    "rx0532 + 62 is toward the top of this range , as if it has evolved into the turnaround region relatively recently .",
    "@xcite fits the empirical relation between @xmath1 and the mass ratio @xmath21 as @xmath22 . using our @xmath1 value ,",
    "we determine @xmath23 , which is typical for dwarf novae with similar periods is computed here using only the uncertainty in @xmath1 ; imperfections in the empirical relation are ignored . ] .",
    "we conclude that rx0532 + 62 is a typical su uma star lying near the minimum period for hydrogen - rich secondary systems .    _",
