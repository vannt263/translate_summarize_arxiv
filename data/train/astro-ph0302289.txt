    "synthesis models for the hard x - ray background , which require a large population of heavily obscured agn ( e.g. setti & woltjer 1989 ) , predict that about 85 per cent of the accretion power in the universe is absorbed ( fabian & iwasawa 1999 ) .",
    "this absorbed energy is expected to be re - emitted in the infrared  millimetre waveband .",
    "one of the most interesting discoveries from the previous , _ rosat _ , era was that a small number of faint x - ray sources were identified with extremely red optical / infrared counterparts ( newsam et al .",
    "1997 ; lehmann et al .",
    "extremely red objects ( eros ) were discovered more than a decade ago ( elston , rieke & rieke 1988 ) but their connection with the broad extragalactic population is only just becoming clear .",
    "it is thought that the population is bimodal ; eros are either ( 1 ) elliptical galaxies at high - redshift ( @xmath56 ) , their red colours being produced by an evolved stellar population , or ( 2 ) they are starburst galaxies at high - redshift ( @xmath57 ) and their red colours are produced by the suppression of uv light from young stars by dust",
    ". however , there is growing evidence that the population of eros might be more diverse than originally thought with several sources showing evidence of agn activity ( smith et al .",
    "2001 ; pierre et al . 2001 ; afonso et al .",
    "2001 ) . in a recent study",
    ", the x - ray colours of eros in the _ chandra _ deep field north suggest that 9 out of 13 of them have x - ray emission from obscured agn ( alexander et al .",
    "the other @xmath58 are likely to be a mixture of low - luminosity agns , normal ellipticals and starbursts .    the first deep survey made with _",
    "xmm - newton _ was a 100  ks observation of the lockman hole ( hasinger et al .",
    "follow - up observations revealed a population of eros .",
    "most of these eros have high x - ray - to - optical flux ratios indicating the presence of an obscured agn ( mainieri et al .",
    "the large collecting area of _ xmm - newton _ makes it possible to examine their x - ray spectra on a case by case basis , providing an excellent opportunity to determine the origin of their x - ray emission , and thereby investigate the role of buried agn in these objects . to elucidate the connection between the x - ray and global properties of eros we here report on radio , millimetre , submillimetre and optical / near - infrared observations of five objects selected from the 100  ks _ xmm - newton _ observation of the lockman hole .    throughout this paper",
    "we define spectral index , @xmath59 , as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the flux density at frequency @xmath62 .",
    "we assume @xmath63  kms@xmath64mpc@xmath64 , and @xmath65 throughout unless otherwise stated .",
    "our sample comprises five out of six of the reddest sources ( those satisfying @xmath66 ) in the 100  ks _ xmm - newton _ observation of the lockman hole ( hasinger et al .",

    "it is immediately clear that ero3 is much softer than the other eros : it is the only source detected below 0.5 kev but it is the weakest source at energies higher than 2 kev . as expected , this difference is borne out by spectral fitting .    initially , each of the ero spectra were fitted with a power law model , absorbed only by the galactic column in the direction of the lockman hole ( @xmath177 @xmath1 ; lockman et al .",

    "the @xmath68-band half - light radius of ero4 , as well as the optical / near - infrared colours , are consistent with an early type galaxy at @xmath221 assuming passive luminosity evolution ; this suggests that the agn in this source contributes very little to its optical / near - infrared light .",
    "in contrast to ero4 , the two ` dusty starburst ' eros and the source with an ambiguous colour classification ( ero2 ) are unusually compact in the @xmath68-band images , suggesting that their near - infrared emission includes a significant contribution from the absorbed agn .",
    "the column densities measured in the x - ray ( @xmath222 for @xmath221 ) do not preclude such a possibility .",
    "indeed , the dust - reddened optical / near - infrared colours of agn are indistinguishable from the colours of young , massive stellar populations , and therefore it is possible that these three sources were selected as eros because they contain dust obscured agn rather than dusty star formation .",
    "this potential agn contribution means that the optical / near - infrared colours alone are not sufficient to determine the nature of the host galaxies in these three objects .",
    "however , the submillimetre detection of ero5 suggests that this source _ is _ a dusty starburst galaxy . in section  [ sec - rnir ]",
    "we argue that it is a ulirg forming stars at a rate of @xmath223  m@xmath196yr@xmath64 .",
    "the detection of radio emission from ero1 suggests that this source is also a dusty , star - forming galaxy .",
    "however , the lack of any detectable radio or submillimetre emission from ero2 suggests that like ero4 , it could be an absorbed agn hosted by a quiescent , early type galaxy .",
    "it is thus apparent that absorbed agn are found in both types of ero : elliptical galaxies at @xmath221 and high - redshift dusty starbursts .",
    "eros such as ero2 and ero4 , which correspond to the first type , have properties that are consistent with a normal galaxy containing an agn which is viewed through an obscuring torus , as expected from agn unified schemes ( antonucci 1993 ) , and hypothesized in large numbers to explain the x - ray background ( e.g. comastri et al . 1995 ) . in these cases ,",
    "the dust is located close to the agn itself , and may be hot .",
    "at least two hard x - ray sources discovered by _",
    "chandra _ have been shown to exhibit these properties ( wilman , fabian & gandhi 2000 ; see also deane & trentham 2001 ) .",
    "eros such as ero1 and ero5 , which correspond to the second type , appear to be undergoing vigorous star formation .",
    "in these sources some obscuration of the agn could be due to warm dust and gas which is associated with the star - forming regions , rather than an obscuring torus .",
    "such sources may be agn at an earlier evolutionary phase than the unobscured agn population ( e.g. fabian 1999 ) .",
    "whatever the host galaxy , if the agn makes a significant contribution to the @xmath68-band flux the position of the source on the colour - colour diagram could be shifted relative to position of the host galaxy , and we caution against applying photometric redshift techniques to compton - thin agn ( e.g. crawford et al . 2002 ) .",
    "if we assume that the @xmath224  kev flux density is little affected by absorption then the agn are characteristic of those found at the break of the x - ray luminosity function ( @xmath225 ) to within a factor of @xmath226 .",
    "for example , ero5 at @xmath67 has an intrinsic luminosity , @xmath227 erg  s@xmath64 , while ero1 at @xmath228 would have @xmath229 ergs@xmath64 compared to @xmath225 @xmath230 ergs@xmath64 ( page et al .",
    "this result implies that four out of five of our eros contain absorbed agn with equivalent luminosities to those that make up the bulk of the unobscured component of the extragalactic x - ray background .",
    "the only ero in our sample that does not appear to have a significant contribution from an agn is ero3 .",
    "if it does contain an agn , then the x - ray spectral fitting suggests that it can not be absorbed by a significant amount of material .",
    "its diffuse , extended near - infrared morphology , however , shows that such an unabsorbed agn must be weak , because it makes a negligible contribution to the @xmath68-band light .",
    "alternative sources of the x - ray emission are powerful starburst activity or halo emission from a massive elliptical galaxy in a deep gravitational potential .",
    "the former case is unlikely for a number of reasons .",
    "firstly , ero3 was undetected in both the submillimetre and radio bands showing that star formation is not occurring on a massive scale ; the limit derived from the deep radio map is sfr @xmath216 m@xmath214yr@xmath64 at @xmath182 .",
    "secondly , its x - ray flux corresponds to a luminosity @xmath231 erg  s@xmath64 ( @xmath182 ) or @xmath227 erg  s@xmath64 ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "this luminosity is too large for almost any conceivable starburst ; the brightest x - ray starburst known is ngc  3256 with @xmath232 erg  s@xmath64 ( moran , lehnert & helfand 1999 ) , more than an order of magnitude less luminous than ero3 .",
    "the temperature that we obtain from the fit to the x  ray spectrum ( @xmath233 13 kev , see fig .",
    "3 ) and the luminosity are , however , within the range of values found for cd galaxies locally ( osullivan , forbed & ponman 2001 , matsushita 2001 ) . this is consistent with the optical / ir colour and size results discussed above and suggests that ero3 is likely to be the dominant galaxy of a cluster .",
    "( 3.0,3.25 )    these results are in good agreement with those deduced from the _ chandra _ deep field north survey ( alexander et al .",
    "they claim that x - ray selected eros that were detected in the hard band are absorbed agn ( 9 out of 13 sources ) , while the 4 sources detected only in the soft band have x - ray emission from less energetic processes .",
    "in particular , a stacking analysis of those eros with @xmath234 that were not individually detected resulted in a statistical detection in the soft band .",
    "they argue that this result is consistent with that expected if the majority of these sources are typical elliptical galaxies .",
    "x - ray spectral fitting shows convincingly that 4/5 of our sources are absorbed agn , and that the other source is likely to be an elliptical galaxy , albeit a very luminous example .",
    "although our sample is small , two of the absorbed agn are likely to contain substantial quantities of warm dust . we speculate that the other absorbed agn might contain only hot circumnuclear dust .",
    "these properties are in keeping with the predictions of models for the x - ray background ( fabian & iwasawa 1999 ) .",
    "this result might also suggest that eros detected as counterparts to faint submillimetre galaxies ( e.g. smail et al .",
    "1999 ) have a reasonable chance of being associated with agn , although we have already noted that only @xmath235 per cent of eros in the lockman hole sample are x - ray sources ( section  [ sec - sample ] ) . similarly , alexander et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find that only @xmath236 per cent of the @xmath237 ero population are obscured agn to the depth of their survey .",
    "another study ( smail et al . 2002 ) suggests that this number could be as low as 2 per cent although their x - ray data are not as deep as those presented by alexander et al .",
    "a recent comparison between faint _ xmm - newton _ sources and submillimetre galaxies selected from the bright end of the number counts showed an overlap of 4 out of 16 , with only one of these sources identified as both an x - ray source and an ero ( ivison et al .",
    "however , these limits only constrain the fraction of eros which contain compton - thin agn",
    ". it will require considerably deeper x - ray observations to detect a population of compton - thick eros with x - ray luminosities similar to , or lower than , the 5 eros studied in this paper .",
    "1 .   we present multifrequency follow - up observations and analysis for 5 out of 6 eros identified in the 100 ks _ xmm - newton _ observation of the lockman hole .",
    "they have enough counts in the x - ray band to allow spectral fitting .",
    "four of them are best - fitted by an absorbed power law model with redshift dependent column densities of @xmath0  @xmath1 .",
    "they are most probably compton thin , obscured agn .",
    "the fifth source has a best fit thermal spectrum and might be a massive elliptical galaxy with x - ray emission associated with its halo .",
    "2 .   the eros have optical / near - infrared colours consistent with dusty sources or normal elliptical galaxies .",
    "@xmath68-band imaging data show that those sources with elliptical colours have sizes predicted for elliptical galaxies at @xmath238 .",
    "the other three sources are smaller than the model predictions ; it is likely that in these cases the host galaxy is dominated by light from the agn , consistent with them being compton - thin agn .",
    "the dust content of the eros is investigated with sensitive observations in the submillimetre and radio bands .",
    "of the two agn with dusty colours , one of them is detected at 850  @xmath116 m which we interpret as emission from warm dust heated by young stars .",
    "the other is detected at 1.4 and 4.9  ghz suggesting that it also is a galaxy undergoing a burst of star formation , albeit at a less spectacular rate .",
    "of the two sources with elliptical - like colours , one of them ( that with the best - fit thermal x - ray spectrum ) is undetected in the submillimetre and radio bands .",
    "the other is a faint radio source  this radio emission might be attributable to the agn .",
    "we argue that the fifth source , an agn with an ambiguous colour classification , has relatively little warm dust , and that the nucleus makes a significant contribution to the @xmath68-band light .",
    "we suggest that the agn with non - dusty colours might contain hot dust that provides viewing angle dependent obscuration ( e.g. a circumnuclear torus ) , while the dusty agn might be obscured by warm dust and gas associated with starburst activity .",
    "the latter might be in an earlier evolutionary phase than the agn hosted by quiescent , early type galaxies .",
    "the eros that host agn have luminosities within a factor of 5 of those found at the break of the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity function , i.e. they have luminosities equivalent to agn that make up the bulk of the unobscured x - ray background .",

    "the comparison sources , both at @xmath240 , are plotted in the observed frame , and have not been shifted in flux level .",

    "the _ isocam _",
    "data have large uncertainties but nevertheless there is reasonably good evidence that the agn have rising spectra between the @xmath68-band and the mid - infrared whereas the starburst - like hr  10 shows the opposite behaviour .",

    "submillimetre spectral index of @xmath242 practically rules out a self - absorbed synchrotron origin for the submillimetre radiation unless the source varied in between the observations which we consider to be unlikely .",
    "although the spectrum is just consistent with that expected for a homogeneous synchrotron source in the optically thick regime ( maximum slope of 2.5 ) such sources have never been observed with turnovers in the far - infrared ( see e.g. discussion in hughes et al .",
    "the most likely interpretation is thus that the submillimetre flux is due to thermal emission from dust .",
    "the radio emission from ero5 is likely to include a large contribution from the agn .",
    "the spectral index between the radio and submillimetre bands is @xmath243 which would place the source at @xmath244 if the radio emission is attributed to star formation alone ( e.g. carilli & yun 1999 ; dunne , clements & eales 2000 ) . turning this argument around , and assuming that all of the submillimetre emission is from dusty star formation , the predicted 1.4  ghz flux density in the observer s frame is approximately @xmath245jy at @xmath67 .",
    "this result implies that most of the @xmath246  mjy emitted at 1.4  ghz is from processes other than star formation .",
    "could the source be radio - loud ?",
    "our 1.4-ghz radio image constrains the source size to be @xmath247 arcsec . at @xmath67",
    "the projected size must thus be smaller than about 8.6 kpc ( or about 12.1 kpc if @xmath248 ) if it is to remain unresolved in our radio images .",
    "the data presented by blundell , rawlings & willott ( 1999 ) show that classical double radio sources have linear sizes ranging from several thousands of kpc to less than one kpc so our size constraints are consistent with a radio galaxy or mis - aligned quasar .",
    "another diagnostic for radio - loudness is the two - point spectral index ( @xmath249 ) measured in the rest frame between 4.86  ghz and the @xmath74-band , where radio - loud sources have indices @xmath250 ( zamorani et al .",
    "we can k - correct the radio data using the observed spectral index between 4.86 and 1.4  ghz of @xmath251 , and the observed @xmath68-band flux corresponds approximately to the rest frame @xmath74-band flux . the calculated index is @xmath252 which falls just into the radio - loud regime .",
    "however , only 0.5 mags of extinction would be required at @xmath68 to place the source on the other side of the divide .",
    "given that ero5 is extremely dusty we consider this very likely to be the case , and so it is most probably radio - quiet according to this diagnostic .",
    "we note that the observed radio flux density and radio spectral index are consistent with those found for radio quiet quasars ( barvainis , lonsdale & antonucci 1996 ) .",
