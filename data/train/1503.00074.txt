    "the rs oph system is composed of a massive ( @xmath9 1.35 m@xmath8 , kato , hachisu @xmath10 luna 2008 ) white dwarf ( wd ) primary accompanied by a red giant secondary of estimated spectral class around m2 iii ( worters et al .",

    "the outburst takes place due to a thermonuclear runaway ( tnr ) on the wd surface that accretes matter from the secondary red giant companion .",
    "the outburst causes ejection of mass @xmath9 10@xmath7 - 10@xmath13 m@xmath8 at a high speed of @xmath9 4000 km s@xmath5 ( e.g. buil 2006 ) .",
    "previous studies of outbursts indicate that the wd mass of rs oph is possibly increasing due to the accumulation of a percentage of the accreted matter on its surface .",
    "consequently , the mass of the wd in rs oph may gradually reach the chandrasekhar limit and explode as a type ia supernova - this has made rs oph an object of great significance to the astrophysicists .",
    "however , there have been considerable debates about this hypothesis ( starrfield et al .",
    "2004 , wood - vasey @xmath10 sokoloski 2006 ) .",
    "+ rs oph was detected in outburst previously in 1898 , 1933 , 1958 , 1967 , 1985 ; its latest outburst was discovered on 2006 february 12.83 ut ( hirosawa 2006 ) .",
    "the reason for the much shorter recurrence period in the rs oph system , in comparison to classical novae ( cne ) , is due to combined effect of the high wd mass and a high accretion rate ( starrfield et al .",
    "1985 , yaron et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the two recent outbursts of rs oph in 1985 and 2006 have been observed intensively over a wide range of wavelengths , from x - rays to the radio regions ( bode 1987 ; evans , bode , obrien @xmath10 darnley 2008 ) .",

    "the nova light curves also behave similarly ; they decline fast with @xmath15 @xmath9 6 and @xmath16 @xmath9 17 days ( rosino 1987 , munari et al .",
    "the key result of the 1985 and 2006 observations was the detection of a shock that is generated while the ejecta interacts with the surrounding wind of the red giant secondary ( bode @xmath10 kahn 1985 , das et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) and a non - spherical bi - polar shape of the nova ejecta ( e.g. , taylor et al .",

    "1986 ) , and an interstellar reddening of e(b - v ) = 0.73 ( snijders 1987 ) .",
    "+ however , despite plenty of observations of rs oph , the abundance analysis of the nova ejecta has not been done adequately .",
    "a few values have been calculated , for example , from optical studies of the 1985 outburst , anupama @xmath10 prabhu ( 1985 ) derived a helium abundance of @xmath19 = 0.16 ; evans et al .",

    "we have used the photoionization code cloudy ( version 13.02 ; ferland et al . , 2013 ) to generate spectra , by varying the parameter values .",
    "model generated spectra are then compared with the observed emission line spectra , the best fit model is chosen by calculating the corresponding @xmath21 values .",
    "the procedure of modeling is described in section 3 ; results obtained from the analysis is described in section 4 .",
    "we use the cloudy photoionization code , c13.02 ( ferland et al . , 2013 ) for the abundance analysis in rs oph .",
    "the benefit of using photoioinization models is that in addition to elemental abundances , they also provide estimate of several other parameters , e.g. , density , source luminosity , source temperature etc .",

    "the physical condition of the shell is described by the density , inner and outer radii , geometry , covering factor ( fraction of 4@xmath22 sr enclosed by the model shell ) , filling factor ( ratio of the contribution of the dense shell to the diffuse shell ) and elemental abundances ( relative to solar ) .",
    "the density of the shell is set by a hydrogen density parameter and the elemental abundances , relative to hydrogen , are set by the abundance parameters .",

    "in addition , cloudy was unable to adequately reproduce a few of the observed lines , e.g. , si ii ( 0.5041 , 0.5056 @xmath14 m ) , fe ii ( 0.5235 , 0.5276 , 0.5317 @xmath14 m ) , [ fe xiv ] ( 0.5303 @xmath14 m ) , n iii ( 0.4641 @xmath14 m ) , raman emission band ( 0.6830 @xmath14 m ) , he i ( 1.1969 , 1.2527 @xmath14 m ) , n i ( 1.2074 , 1.2096 , 1.2470 @xmath14 m ) , o i ( 1.1287 , 1.3164 @xmath14 m ) , [ mn xiv ] ( 2.0894 @xmath14 m ) and he i ( 2.1120 @xmath14 m ) .",

    "+ overall abundance values for rs oph , calculated from the mean of these modeled results , are presented in table 3 .",
    "abundances are given as logarithm of the numbers relative to hydrogen and relative to solar .",
    "the derived values show that the helium , nitrogen , neon , iron and argon abundances are all enhanced relative to solar , while the oxygen and aluminium abundances are solar with respect to hydrogen , and silicon abundances are subsolar with respect to hydrogen .",
    "we note that there is no prominent line of oxygen in the observed spectra .",
    "our determination of the oxygen abundance is based on the feature at 0.5017 @xmath14 m that is blended with he i and fe ii .",
    "therefore the calculated abundance value of oxygen may incorporate a significant error .",
    "similarly , the calculation of abundances of silicon , argon and aluminium is based on one or two observed lines only .",
    "modeling of multi - wavelength spectra , observed over a longer time scale may improve the level of accuracy .      using the parameter values determined from the present analysis",
