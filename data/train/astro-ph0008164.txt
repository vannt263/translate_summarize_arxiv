    "more than sixty years ago , oosterhoff ( 1939 ) discovered that galactic globular clusters could be classified into two groups according to the frequency distribution of the periods of their rr lyrae variables .",
    "he suggested that the absolute median magnitude of the variables may differ from one cluster to another , but since his result was based on data for only five clusters , an extension of the investigation would be desirable .",
    "subsequent studies by oosterhoff ( 1944 ) and van agt & oosterhoff ( 1959 ) showed that the division into two groups was indeed more general .",
    "is 0319 , the mean period of the rrab variables @xmath2 is 0549 , and the proportion of the variables classified as type c ( @xmath3 ) is @xmath4 .",
    "the comparable figures for the ooii clusters are @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "] at the same time , sandage ( 1958 ) demonstrated that a difference of @xmath8 between the rr lyrae variables in the two groups could account for the observed difference in the periods .",
    "meanwhile , evidence for a connection between oosterhoff type and heavy element abundance was mounting .",
    "arp ( 1955 ) reported that the spectra of giant stars in the ooii clusters m15 and m92 had excessively weak metal lines and kinman ( 1959 ) reached a similar conclusion in a study of integrated spectra of globular clusters .",
    "( kinman s investigation was based on the spectral type obtained from a comparison of the g band with the h@xmath9 line . ) as a result of these findings , it is generally assumed that oosterhoff type is associated with metal abundance .",
    "however , in their seminal paper on the oosterhoff groups , van albada and baker ( 1973 ) pointed out that the distribution of color on the horizontal branch was a more important factor .",
    "they found that the fraction of hb stars on the blue side of the rr lyrae gap was greater in ooii clusters .",
    "consequently , they suggested that the rr lyrae variables in the ooii clusters must be evolving from blue to red through the instability strip , while those in the ooi clusters evolve from red to blue .",
    "this difference in direction of evolution , combined with a hysteresis effect in the pulsations could account for the difference in periods and the different proportions of rrc stars between the two groups .",
    "later , gratton , tornamb & ortolani ( 1986 ) and lee , demarque & zinn ( 1990 , hereafter ldz ) pointed out that the rr lyrae variables in the ooii clusters could be post zahb stars whose zahb phase is on the blue side of the instability strip .",
    "one would therefore expect the rr lyrae variables in the ooii clusters to evolve redward and to have lower masses and higher luminosities than those in ooi clusters .    in oosterhoff",
    "s original investigations , @xmath0 centauri was considered to belong to group ii , the long period group , but when freeman & rodgers ( 1975 ) discovered that there was a diversity in composition among its rr lyrae variables , some investigators recognized that it had properties of both groups .",
    "butler , dickens & epps ( 1978 ) pointed out that the rr lyrae variables with [ fe / h ] greater than @xmath10 have the characteristics of type i and that the more metal poor stars exhibit type ii characteristics . taking a different approach , caputo & castellani ( 1975 ) demonstrated that the period - frequency plot for the low luminosity rrab stars showed ooi characteristics and suggested that @xmath0 cen provides a link between the two oosterhoff groups . the purpose of the present investigation is to use pulsation theory to derive relative masses for the @xmath0 cen rr lyrae variables to test the hypothesis that the ooii variables have lower masses and higher luminosities than the ooi variables .",
    "our study is based on the observations made by the ogle team .",
    "in 1993 , 1994 and 1995 , ccd observations of @xmath0 centauri were made as a side - project of the ogle ( optical gravitational lensing experiment ) team . as a result ,",
    "three papers on variable stars have been published by kaluzny and his collaborators ( kaluzny _ et al .",
    "1996 , 1997a , 1997b ) .",
    "the first two papers deal with eclipsing binaries , sx phe stars and spotted variables , and the third , hereafter referred to as k97b , presents periods and light curves for 140 rr lyrae and population ii cepheid variables . _",
    "the present investigation is based on the @xmath11 magnitudes for 128 of the stars studied by k97b .",
    "our sample consists of all of the stars with mean v magnitude between @xmath12 and @xmath13 and periods less than 09 , with the exception of ogle # 95 , 96 , 171 and 208 for which k97b published periods close to one half day and amplitudes less than @xmath14 mag .",
    "the ogle observations included seven different fields : 5139a , b , c , bc , d , e and f. field 5139b , which covered the most central part of the cluster , contained more rr lyrae variables than any of the other fields , but many of these stars were included in other fields as well .",
    "since there are zero point shifts as large as @xmath15 mag from one field to another , it was desirable to consider as many stars as possible in one field only .",
    "consequently , if a star was observed in field b , our analysis is based only on the observations in field b. some stars were observed only in fields e and f , and in these cases , we used the data from field e. in general , we included only magnitudes for which the listed error was less than @xmath16 mag for our analysis .",
    "however , for ogle # 194 , we included all magnitudes with errors less than @xmath17 in order to obtain sufficient phase coverage ..    to begin our analysis , we plotted a light curve for each star using the period listed in table 1 of k97b .",
    "for some stars , we found small phase shifts in the curves , and in these cases , we revised the periods .",
    "our adopted periods are listed in table 1 and light curves , arranged in order of increasing period , are shown in figure 1 .",
    "all but one of the periods agree to within 00001 of those published by k97b . for star",
    "ogle # 149 , we found a much shorter period , 0378 compared with the k97b value 0609 .",
    "an examination of fig .",
    "1 shows how the general characteristics of the light curves change with period .",
    "it was in a study of the rr lyrae variables in @xmath0 cen that bailey ( 1902 ) set up his three subclasses @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "he considered v8 ( ogle # 199 , p=05213 ) to be a typical star for subclass @xmath18 , v3 ( ogle # 184 , p=084126 ) for subclass @xmath19 and v35 ( ogle # 78 , p=03868 ) for subclass @xmath20 .",
    "the stars of subclass @xmath20 have the shortest periods and type @xmath19 have the longest periods .",
    "in addition , the light curves for the three subclasses differ in amplitude and in shape .",
    "it was subsequently demonstrated by schwarzschild ( 1940 ) , in a test of the period - density relation for rr lyrae variables in m3 , that the @xmath20-type variables were most likely pulsating in the first overtone , while the @xmath18- and @xmath19- types were pulsating in the fundamental mode . since this mode difference",
    "was recognized , the distinction between @xmath18 and @xmath19 has usually been disregarded and both groups have been referred to as rrab types . however , because of the high quality of the light curves of fig .  1 , the difference between types @xmath18 and @xmath19 is very clear .",
    "there is a sudden change in slope about halfway up the rising branch of the @xmath19 type light curves .",
    "other stars classified as @xmath19 by bailey and subsequently by martin ( 1938 ) in his major study of @xmath0 cen are variables 15 , 26 , 34 , 38 , 54 and 85 ( ogle # 124 , 120 , 90 , 170 , 74 and 176 respectively ) and the light curves for all of these stars show that same characteristic .    in table 1 , we list for each star the ogle i d # , the variable number from sawyer hogg s ( 1973 ) catalogue , the field , our adopted period , the @xmath11 amplitude , the mean @xmath11 magnitude and the mode of pulsation according to the location of the star in the period - amplitude diagram . the period - luminosity ( p - l ) and period - amplitude ( p - a ) relations are plotted in fig .  2 .",
    "the points in the p - a diagram seem to fall into different regimes which we interprete to be due to different modes of pulsation and have therefore plotted a different symbol for each mode .",
    "also , among the fundamental mode and second overtone pulsators , there are two sequences in the p - a plot .",
    "a mean magnitude of @xmath21 roughly divides the stars into these two sequences .",
    "we assume these occur because stars of both oosterhoff classes are present in @xmath0 cen",
    ". this will be discussed further in section 3 . in table 1 ,",
    "the fundamental mode pulsators are denoted as f and the overtone pulsators as 1st , 2nd or 3rd , depending on the mode of pulsation .",
    "the amplitudes and mean magnitudes listed in table 1 were obtained from fits of the v magnitudes to a fourier series of the form : @xmath22 where @xmath0 is ( @xmath23/period ) . for each star , the epoch was taken as hjd @xmath24 so that @xmath25 in the equation refers to ( hjd-@xmath24 ) and hjd represents the heliocentric julian date of the observation .",
    "for the fundamental mode pulsators , the order of the fit @xmath26 was 8 and for the overtone pulsators , it was 6 .",
    "the adopted mean @xmath11 magnitude is @xmath27 from the fit of equation 1 . in order to classify the light curves of the fundamental mode pulsators as normal ( n ) or peculiar ( p ) , we used equations derived by kovcs & kanbur ( 1998 ) for testing the compatibilty condition of jurcsik & kovcs ( 1996 , hereafter jk ) .",
    "the mean periods for the stars in our sample are as follows : 0649 for the 59 fundamental mode , 0383 for the 48 first overtone and 0304 for the 21 second and third overtone pulsators .",
    "the mean periods for the fundamental and first overtone are very close to those derived by van agt and oosterhoff ( 1959 ) for the oosterhoff type ii clusters .",
    "thus , even though @xmath0 cen seems to contain rr lyrae variables of both oosterhoff groups , most belong to group ii .",
    "although we have classified many of the rr lyrae stars as second overtone pulsators ( rre stars ) , the possibility of the existence of rre stars has been the subject of some debate in the literature .",
    "a few years ago , stellingwerf , gautschy & dickens ( 1987 ) calculated a model for a second - overtone pulsator with an amplitude similar to first overtone pulsators .",
    "they predicted that the light variation of an rre star should have a sharper peak at maximum light .",
    "however , they noted that they could not exclude the possibility that rre stars may have lower amplitudes and sinusoidal light variations .",
    "the rre candidates that we have identified in @xmath0 cen have sinusoidal light variations and low amplitudes compared to the fundamental mode and first overtone pulsators .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 3 where we show the light curves for the three stars that bailey considered the prototypes for his subclasses @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 along with the curve for ogle # 191 ( v184 ) , one of the stars we have classified as rre .",
    "there is a distinct progression in amplitude and degree of symmetry from subclass @xmath18 through @xmath20 and # 191 forms a natural extension to the sequence",
    ".    studies of p - a relations have led many other investigators to recognize plausible rre candidates .",
    "evidence for an rre star in the field ( v2109 cygni ) has been presented by kiss _",
    "et al . ( 1999 ) .",
    "credible rre candidates have also been identified in the globular clusters m68 ( van albada & baker 1973 ) , ngc 4833 ( demers & wehlau 1977 ) , ic 4499 ( clement , dickens & bingham 1979 , walker & nemec 1996 ) , m3 ( kaluzny _ et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter k98 ) and m5 ( kaluzny _ et al .",
    "2000 , hereafter k2000 ) .",
    "in addition , recent studies of m2 ( lee & carney 1999a ) and ngc 5466 ( corwin , carney & nifong 1999 ) indicate that there may be second overtone pulsators in these clusters as well .",
    "however , kovcs ( 1998a ) compared the rre candidates in m68 and ic 4499 with the other rrc stars and concluded that their relative magnitudes and colors were incompatible with the assumption that they were rre stars .",
    "furthermore , the models of bono _ et al .",
    "( 1997 , hereafter referred to as b97 ) predict that a plot of amplitude versus period ( or temperature ) for first overtone pulsators shows a characteristic ` bell ' shape with amplitudes decreasing at shorter periods and higher temperatures .",
    "one would therefore expect the first overtone variables with the shortest periods to have the lowest amplitudes .",
    "this is exactly what clement & shelton ( 1999a ) found in a recent study of the globular cluster m9 ; the p - a plot for the overtone pulsators had the classic ` bell ' shape .",
    "thus , it is possible that some of the short - period , low - amplitude variables in @xmath0 cen are pulsating in the first overtone mode .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the shifts in the period - luminosity plot for the stars in the different period - amplitude regimes of fig .  2 indicate the existence of more than two pulsation modes . among the stars plotted in the upper panel of fig .",
    "2 with @xmath28 between @xmath29 and @xmath21 , the rre candidates ( solid triangles ) have @xmath30 in the range @xmath31 to @xmath32 while the other rrc stars ( open circles ) have longer periods ( @xmath30 between @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) .",
    "the luminosities of both groups are comparable .",
    "rre stars are expected to have shorter periods and lower amplitudes so we might assume that the stars with shorter periods are rre stars .",
    "on the other hand , if they are all rrc stars , the stars with shorter periods must have higher temperatures and/or higher masses .",
    "this is required by the period - density relation ( see equation ( 7 ) ) .",
    "if the temperatures are the same , the stars with shorter periods must have higher masses .",
    "however , when we consider the amplitudes , it turns out that the short period stars can not have higher masses .",
    "b97 made a number of plots to illustrate the dependence of amplitude for first overtone pulsators on temperature , mass and luminosity .",
    "their diagrams demonstrate that , at constant temperature and luminosity , stars with lower amplitudes have lower not higher masses .",
    "this implies that if the solid triangles represent first overtone pulsators , they must have higher temperatures than the others .",
    "in fact , they must be hotter by @xmath34 ( almost 500k ) . another puzzling feature to note in the period - amplitude plot of fig .",
    "2 is the general tendency for amplitude to decrease with increasing period for the solid triangles brighter than @xmath35 .",
    "this is not the characteristic ` bell ' shape predicted by b97 for period amplitude plots of first overtone variables .",
    "we therefore conclude that these stars are probably not first overtone pulsators ; rather they are pulsating in the second overtone mode .",
    "there may even be third overtone pulsators among the rr lyrae population in @xmath0 cen ! _ _ _ _",
    "most of the second and third overtone pulsators listed in table 1 have no sawyer hogg numbers .",
    "this is because their amplitudes are generally lower than those of the rrc stars and as a result , they were not identified in the earlier photographic studies of @xmath0 cen by bailey ( 1902 ) and martin ( 1938 ) .",
    "it is also possible that the four stars that we exluded from our investigation , ogle # 95 , 96 , 171 and 208 are second overtone pulsators .",
    "an independent argument for the existence of rre stars has been proposed by the macho consortium . in a study of rr lyrae variables in the lmc ,",
    "alcock _ et al .",
    "( 1996 ) showed that the period frequency distribution had three peaks , at periods of 058 , 034 , and 028 respectively .",
    "they interpreted this to mean there were three pulsation modes . in fig .  4 , we plot a period - frequency distribution for the ogle sample of @xmath0 cen rr lyrae variables",
    ". it also has three peaks , but the periods associated with the peaks are longer than those in the lmc .",
    "they occur at periods of 063 , 040 and 032 .",
    "we assume that the periods for the peaks differ because most of the rr lyrae variables in @xmath0 cen have ooii characteristics , while the lmc has mainly an ooi population .",
    "an examination of figure 2 shows that , although there are some rrc stars with periods of approximately 032 ( @xmath36 ) , the peak would not occur if there were no rre stars .",
    "we therefore concur with alcock _ et al . that the reason for the extra peak at short periods in the period - frequency distribution of both systems is the presence of rre stars .",
    "there is another important difference between the period - frequency distributions of @xmath0 cen and the lmc  the size of the peaks . for @xmath0 cen",
    ", they are all at approximately the same height , but for the lmc , the height of the peak increases with period , thus implying there are more rrab stars than rrc stars and more rrc stars than rre stars .",
    "it is well known that ooi systems have more rrab stars than rrc stars and van albada and baker ( 1973 ) attributed this to different predominant directions of evolution through the instability strip for the two groups , accompanied by a hysteresis effect in the pulsation .",
    "this could account for the fact that the lmc has significantly fewer rre stars than rrc stars .",
    "however , it may also be a detection problem because the rre stars have lower amplitudes . _ _      with accurate ccd photometry , it is possible to identify low level changes in the amplitudes of rr lyrae variables and a number of such changes have been noted .",
    "walker ( 1994 ) found short term variations in the light curve of the short period rrc ( rre candidate ) star v5 in m68 .",
    "more recently , olech and his collaborators found changes on time scales of a few days in the light curves of three rrc stars in m55 ( olech _ et al .",
    "1999a ) and one in m5 ( olech _ et al .",
    "they also found that these stars all had multiple periods .",
    "for example , in their analysis of v104 in m5 , they identified two clear peaks in the periodogram at periods of 0332 and 0311 and they attributed these to the presence of non - radial oscillations , similar to those observed in many @xmath37 scuti stars .",
    "theoretical calculations made by van hoolst _",
    "1998 ) have demonstrated that non - radial modes can be excited in rr lyrae variables as well .",
    "non - radial oscillations have also been detected in some rr lyrae stars in the galactic bulge by moskalik ( 2000 ) and in the lmc by kovcs _",
    "et al . ( 2000 ) .",
    "_ _ _ _    the ogle dataset for @xmath0 cen includes a number of rr lyrae stars that change on a time scale of days . in particular , k97b commented on the instability of the light curve of # 162 , but an examination of the light curves of fig .",
    "1 indicates that there are others as well . in fig .  5 , we show a light curve for # 186 , based on 10 consecutive nights in 1995 .",
    "the observations for each night are plotted with a different symbol and it is very clear that there are changes on the scale of a few days . in fig .",
    "6 , we present @xmath38-transforms for # 186 ; the real data are plotted in the upper panel and the prewhitened data in the lower panel .",
    "the diagram indicates that there are two well defined periods , just as olech _",
    "et al . found for the stars that they studied .",
    "thus we conclude that # 186 is an rre star that exhibits non - radial pulsations . _        in the last few years",
    ", two methods have been devised for deriving luminosities of rr lyrae variables from fourier parameters .",
    "since there is a range of more than @xmath39 in the apparent @xmath11 magnitude among the rr lyrae variables in @xmath0 cen , it provides a good sample for testing these methods .    in an investigation of hydrodynamic pulsation models for rrc stars , simon & clement ( 1993a , b ) analysed the light curves and derived the following relationships : @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the luminosity in terms of the sun s luminosity , @xmath43 is the mass in solar units , @xmath44 is the pulsation period in days , @xmath45 is the fourier phase difference ( @xmath46 ) computed from the fit of equation ( 1 ) to the points .",
    "( the standard deviations of the fits for @xmath47 and @xmath48 to equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) were @xmath49 and @xmath17 respectively . )",
    "thus the analysis indicated that @xmath45 depends essentially on mass and luminosity and that it is insensitive to metallicity .",
    "this means that equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) can be applied to stars with different metal abundance .",
    "once the mass and luminosity have been evaluated , the effective temperature can also be calculated from the period - density relation which can be expressed in the following form : @xmath50 kovcs and his collaborators took a different approach .",
    "they derived empirical formulae for calculating @xmath51 by studying systems in which there are large numbers of rr lyrae variables , e.  g. the sculptor dwarf galaxy .",
    "for the rrc stars , kovcs ( 1998b ) derived the following formula for calculating the absolute magnitude : @xmath52 where @xmath44 is the period , @xmath53 is the phase difference @xmath54 based on a sine series fit , @xmath55 is the fourth order amplitude and the standard deviation of the fit was @xmath56 .",
    "the zero point was based on the baade - wesselink luminosity scale of clementini _ et al .",
    "it should be noted that the luminosity scale for rr lyrae variables is still the subject of some controversy , but even if there is an error in the zero point for equation ( 5 ) , the relative ranking of the magnitudes will not be affected . _    in table 2 , we list the fourier phase differences @xmath53 , @xmath45 , ( along with their errors ) and the amplitude @xmath55 for all of the overtone pulsators derived from equation ( 1 ) .",
    "also included are @xmath51 , @xmath47 and @xmath43 calculated from equations ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) and [ fe / h]@xmath57 values recently determined by rey _ et al .",
    "( 2000 , hereafter r2000 ) from c@xmath58 photometry .",
    "the stars are arranged in order of increasing period .",
    "the asterisks beside some of the star numbers refer to the oosterhoff type and will be discussed further in section @xmath59 . in our calculations of @xmath51 , @xmath47 and @xmath43 ,",
    "we included only the stars for which the error in the phase difference is less than @xmath14 .",
    "for most of the short - period stars , the errors are large , particularly those for @xmath45 .",
    "this is because of their low amplitudes and sinusoidal light curves .",
    "kovcs fourier fit was based on a sine series , but the parameters that we list in table 2 are based on a cosine series . therefore , to put our values for the phase differences on the same system as his , we subtracted @xmath60 from @xmath53 before we computed @xmath51 . in fig .  7",
    ", we plot the computed @xmath61 and @xmath51 against the mean @xmath11 magnitude .",
    "the first overtone pulsators are plotted as solid circles and the second overtone pulsators as open triangles .",
    "the crosses represent stars not considered to be cluster members .",
    "the open circles enclosed in boxes denote four anomalous variables # 132 , # 169 ( v123 ) , # 185 ( v47 ) and # 73 ( v68 ) which all have unusually high values of @xmath53 according to table 2 .",
    "we have classified them as rrc stars even though they all have periods greater than 044 .",
    "the envelope lines in the upper panel are separated by @xmath62 , the uncertainty in the calibration of equation ( 2 ) and most of the solid circles lie either on these lines or between them .",
    "it appears that equation ( 2 ) is effective for predicting the relative luminosities of the rrc stars .",
    "the envelope lines in the lower panel are separated by @xmath63 , the uncertainty in kovcs ( 1998b ) calibration and here the fit is not quite so good .",
    "for the faintest first overtone pulsators , the predicted magnitudes are too bright . on the other hand , equation ( 5 ) predicts fainter values of @xmath51 for the second overtone pulsators due to their shorter periods and lower @xmath55 .",
    "no values of @xmath61 were computed for second overtone pulsators because the errors in their @xmath45 values were all greater than our threshold @xmath14 because of their low amplitudes . _    in fig .",
    "8 , we show the relationship between @xmath61 and @xmath51 calculated from the fourier parameters .",
    "they correlate well and this leads us to conclude that the two outliers plotted as crosses in fig .",
    "7 at @xmath64 ( # 97 and # 192 ) are not cluster members .",
    "they just happen to be in the field of view .",
    "another star that is probably not a member is # 181 which , with @xmath65 , is off the scale of fig .",
    "however , it is plotted in fig .  8 and lies between the envelope lines .",
    "the outlier at @xmath66 in fig .",
    "8 is star # 185 ( p=0485 ) , one of the anomalous stars with large @xmath53 .",
    "the light curve for this star has an inflection on the rising branch that is different from most of the other rrc stars .",
    "the light curve for # 169 is similar , but it is not plotted in fig .  8 because its @xmath45 error is greater than @xmath14 .",
    "if it were , the point would also lie to the right of the envelope lines .",
    "an empirical formula for relating the absolute magnitude to period and fourier coefficients for rrab stars was derived by kovcs & jurcsik ( 1996 ) : @xmath67 in table 3 , we list the fourier amplitude @xmath68 , phase difference @xmath45 , @xmath51 calculated from equation ( 6 ) for the rrab variables with ` normal ' light curves and the [ fe / h]@xmath57 values recently determined by r2000 .",
    "the stars are listed in order of increasing period .",
    "the fourier coefficients in equation ( 6 ) are based on a sine series . therefore , to put our coefficients from table 3 on the appropriate system , we added @xmath69 to @xmath45 before calculating @xmath51 . in fig .",
    "9 , we plot @xmath51 against @xmath28 and the two quantities correlate reasonably well . however , the fit for the @xmath0 cen rrab stars is not as good as the fits for ngc 6171 and m3 based on the observations of clement & shelton ( 1997 ) and kaluzny _ et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "the envelope lines have a slope of unity and their separation @xmath70 represents the uncertainty in the values of @xmath51 derived from equation ( 6 ) .",
    "most of the points fall between the two lines , but # 174 ( v84 ) with @xmath71 is displaced by more than @xmath72 mag .",
    "bailey did not determine a period for this star , but in fig .",
    "1 , it is clear that its light curve has the classic ` @xmath19 ' characteristics in spite of its relatively short period ( 05799 ) . in their paper on the chemical inhomogeneity of @xmath0 centauri , freeman & rodgers ( 1975 ) found that the strength of the ca ii k - line for this star was greater than that of any of the other 27 rr lyrae variables in their sample . we therefore conclude that # 174 ( v84 ) is a foreground star that belongs to a different population . _",
    "in a study of the period - amplitude relation of rrab stars in the ooi globular clusters m107 , m4 , m5 , m3 , and the ooii clusters m9 , m68 and m92 , clement & shelton ( 1999b ) found that the period - amplitude relation for rrab stars appears to be a function of oosterhoff type .",
    "they therefore concluded that evolutionary effects were more important than metal abundance for determining where a star lies in the period - amplitude plane provided the star had a ` normal ' light curve . in fig .",
    "10 , we plot @xmath73 versus @xmath30 for the @xmath0 cen fundamental mode pulsators with ` normal ' light curves and for first overtone stars with errors less than @xmath14 in @xmath45 .",
    "only stars that are considered to be members of the @xmath0 cen population according to the discussion in sections @xmath74 and @xmath75 are included in the plot .",
    "stars with @xmath76 are plotted as solid triangles or solid circles and the fainter stars are plotted as open triangles or open circles .",
    "the straight line between @xmath77 and @xmath78 is a least squares fit to the rrab stars with @xmath76 and its location in the p - a plane is close to the line that clement & shelton ( 1999b ) derived for ooii rrab stars .",
    "most of the ( solid ) points lie very close to this line ; their mean deviation @xmath79 is @xmath80 .",
    "their mean period is 0673 , a value appropriate for an ooii classification .",
    "jurcsik ( 1998a ) has previously pointed out that the bulk of the rrab stars in @xmath0 cen comprise a very homogeneous group and one can see this in fig .  10 .",
    "the straight line between @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the ooi p - a relation that clement & shelton ( 1999b ) derived from the m3 data of k98 .",
    "several of the fainter rrab stars ( the open circles and the open triangles ) lie close to this ooi relation .",
    "the mean period for the fainter stars is 0542 , a typical ooi value .",
    "thus the p - a relation for the rrab seems to be effective for distinguishing between oosterhoff types .",
    "the fainter rrab stars are more metal rich on the average ; their mean [ fe / h ] is @xmath83 compared with @xmath84 for the stars with @xmath85 .",
    "however , there is not a strong correlation between @xmath28 and [ fe / h ] .",
    "this point has already been made by r2000 and by demarque _",
    "et al . ( 2000 ) who note that the luminosity also depends on evolutionary status or hb morphology . _    the other lines in fig .",
    "10 represent least squares fits to the p - a relations for the rrc stars in m3 ( ooi ) and m68 ( ooii ) based on the data of k98 and walker ( 1994 ) . in this case , the distinction between ooi and ii is not so marked for stars brighter or fainter than @xmath21 .",
    "it seems that , for the rrc stars , the @xmath35 cutoff distinguishing between ooi and ooii types is too faint .",
    "therefore , in our discussion of rrc stars in the next section , we decide oosterhoff type according to position in the p - a diagram .",
    "rrc stars with periods less than 035 lie closer to the m3 line and so we consider them to be ooi variables .",
    "stars with periods in the range 035 to 043 are considered to be ooii variables .",
    "the ooi stars are indicated by single asterisks and the ooii stars by double asterisks in table 2 .    a curious feature of fig .",
    "10 is the existence of first overtone pulsators with periods in the range of 044 to 054 .",
    "m68 does not have any overtone pulsators with such long periods , even among the double - mode pulsators whose first overtone periods range from 039 to 041 . these long period stars in @xmath0 cen",
    "are brighter than the others and as we noted in section @xmath86 , they have unusually large values for @xmath53 .",
    "the stars with the inflection on the rising branch of the light curves ( # 169 and # 185 ) are among them .",
    "the recent study of m5 by k2000 shows that m5-v76 has similar properties .      in section @xmath74",
    ", we showed that equation ( 2 ) , which was derived from hydrodynamic pulsation models by simon & clement ( 1993a ) , successfully ranks the relative luminosities of the @xmath0 cen rrc stars .",
    "k2000 reached the same conclusion in their recent study of m5 .",
    "we now use the masses computed from equation ( 3 ) , which was also derived from the models , to compare the masses and luminosites of rrc stars in clusters belonging to both oosterhoff groups .",
    "our results are summarized in table 4 where we compare the data for @xmath0 cen with six other well studied globular clusters , three from each oosterhoff group .",
    "these are m107 ( clement & shelton 1997 ) , m5 ( k2000 ) , m3 ( k98 ) , m55 ( olech _ et al .",
    "1999a ) , m68 ( walker 1994 ) and m15 ( clement & shelton 1996 , based on the data of silbermann & smith 1995 ) .",
    "for each cluster , we list [ fe / h ] , the number of stars analysed , their mean period , mean mass , mean luminosity and mean temperature .",
    "for these last three quantities , we also include the standard error of the mean .",
    "most of the [ fe / h ] values are taken from the compilation of zinn ( 1985 ) , but for @xmath0 cen , they are means of the [ fe / h]@xmath57 values derived for the individual stars by r2000 .",
    "the @xmath0 cen variables are segregated according to oosterhoff type .",
    "the four bright stars with periods greater than 044 are not included .",
    "their derived masses are uncertain because they are well below the range of the models which were computed for masses ranging from @xmath87 to @xmath88 . the clusters are arranged in order of increasing @xmath47 which is , in general , the order of decreasing metal abundance and decreasing temperature .",
    "the mean period increases through the sequence until m68 and m15 , the two ooii clusters that have the highest frequency of double - mode rr lyrae variables ( rrd stars ) . in these two clusters , the overtone pulsators with periods longer than 039",
    "are rrd stars and as a result , the mean periods for their rrc stars are shorter than those for m55 .",
    "the masses calculated from equation ( 3 ) are low compared with those derived from evolutionary models ( dorman 1992 ) and other investigations of pulsation .",
    "however , the relative ranking is in agreement with masses derived from the analysis of rrd stars .",
    "studies of pulsation models by kovcs _",
    "1992 ) , cox ( 1995 ) and bono _ et al .",
    "( 1996 ) all indicate that the rrd variables in the ooii clusters m15 and m68 are more massive than those in the ooi clusters m3 and ic 4499 .",
    "most of their models indicate that the difference between the two is approximately @xmath89 .",
    "three of these clusters are included in table 4 which indicates that the rrc stars in m15 and m68 are @xmath90 more massive than the ones in m3 .",
    "another point to note about m68 and m15 is that the masses derived for their rrc stars from @xmath45 are considerably higher than those for @xmath0 cen and m55 .",
    "if this is correct , then the data of table 4 suggest that the double - mode phenomenon may occur only in higher mass stars .",
    "recent studies of m55 and @xmath0 cen have not revealed any rrd stars .",
    "furthermore , nemec , nemec & norris ( 1986 ) analysed martin s ( 1938 ) published observations of the @xmath0 cen rr lyrae variables and found no rrd stars .",
    "freyhammer , andersen & petersen ( 1998 , 2000 ) have detected multi - mode pulsation in a few variables in @xmath0 cen , but they are sx phe , not rr lyrae variables . _ _ _    another feature of the sequence of masses listed in table 4 is the discontinuity at the interface between the two oosterhoff groups .",
    "although there is an increase of mass with luminosity among the clusters in each group , there is a sudden drop in mass at the transition .",
    "the ooii rrc stars in @xmath0 cen and m55 have lower masses and higher luminosities than the ooi rrc stars in @xmath0 cen and m3 .",
    "this is exactly what is predicted by ldz .",
    "the ooii rr lyrae variables are evolved stars from the blue horizontal branch so that when they cross the instability strip , they have lower masses and higher luminosities than the ooi variables .",
    "we now use the period - density relation to compare the masses of the rrab stars of the two oosterhoff groups in @xmath0 cen .",
    "the period - density relation can be expressed as a relationship among pulsation period , luminosity , mass and surface effective temperature . from models based on opal opacities ,",
    "cox ( 1995 ) derived a relation for fundamental mode rr lyrae pulsators with composition comparable to the @xmath0 cen variables ( z=@xmath91 ) : @xmath92 our procedure is to select pairs of stars for which the amplitude is the same ( within @xmath16 mag ) , one from each oosterhoff group according to the p - a diagram of fig .",
    "10 , and then use the period - density relation to calculate the difference in mass . from equation ( 7 ) , we derive : @xmath93 where @xmath94 refers to the apparent bolometric magnitude .",
    "we limit our selections to pairs of stars in the same field so that the luminosity difference obtained from the observations is reliable .",
    "otherwise the shifts in zero point between the different fields would introduce large uncertainties into the results .    in order to apply equation ( 8)",
    ", we need to know the temperature differences , but the temperatures of the stars are not known .",
    "our approach therefore is to evaluate @xmath95 for three different assumed values of @xmath96 , selected in the following manner .",
    "we choose our first value @xmath97 because b97 showed that the correlation between amplitude and effective temperature of fundamental mode pulsators does not have a strong dependence on mass or luminosity .",
    "their study was based on nonlinear pulsation models with helium content @xmath98 . on this basis",
    ", one would expect a one - to - one correspondence between amplitude and temperature .",
    "our second value for @xmath96 is @xmath99 .",
    "we choose this value because sandage ( 1993 ) presented evidence that ooii rrab stars are cooler than those of ooi .",
    "for rrab stars at the blue fundamental edge of the instability strip , he derived the relationship : @xmath100 $ ] . among the star pairs",
    "we have selected , the ooii rrab stars are more metal poor by an average amount @xmath101 . therefore , based on sandage s relationship , we derive a mean @xmath102 .",
    "we choose our third value @xmath103 because our analysis of the rrc stars in @xmath0 cen also indicates that the ooii rr lyrae variables are cooler .",
    "according to the data of table 4 , the mean temperature of the ooii rrc stars in @xmath0 cen is lower by @xmath104 than that of the ooi stars . for equation ( 8)",
    ", we also need to know the bolometric corrections ( bc ) in order to compute @xmath94 .",
    "jurcsik ( 1998b ) derived equations for relating bc to [ fe / h ] and temperature and from her equations , we derive the following relationship : @xmath105.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we use equation ( 9 ) to calculate @xmath106 for each assumed value of @xmath96 .",
    "our selected pairs of stars ( seven in all ) are listed in table 5 .",
    "also listed are the observed differences @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 $ ] and the @xmath111 values calculated from equation ( 8) according to the different assumptions for @xmath96 . on the last line , the mean value for each quantity is listed . for each assumed temperature difference ,",
    "the mean mass of the ooii stars is lower than the mean for the ooi stars , just as we found for the rrc stars .",
    "this is further support for the ldz hypothesis .",
    "if the ldz hypothesis is correct , one would also expect to find that the periods of ooii rr lyrae stars increase .",
    "this is exactly what has been found in a recent study of the period changes of rrab stars in @xmath0 cen by jurcsik ( 2000 ) and jurcsik _ et al .",
    "although our analysis of the rrab star pairs indicates that , in general masses are lower and luminosities are higher for the ooii stars , there are individual cases that are exceptions . for example , the ooii star # 147 has a higher mass than the ooi star # 154 for all of our assumed values of @xmath112 .",
    "this is because # 147 is so much brighter than # 154 that its mass must also be larger to account for its observed period .",
    "another anomalous star is # 113 . for six of the seven pairs listed in table 5 , the ooii star is brighter , but the ooi star # 113 is brighter than its ooii counterpart . in fact , it is brighter than any of the other stars that lie near our adopted ooi p - a relation . an examination of fig .",
    "1 shows that its light curve does not have the characteristic bump and dip preceding the rise to maximum light .",
    "theoretical light curves published by b97 illustrate that , at constant mass and temperature , models with higher luminosity have a less pronounced bump .",
    "this is exactly what we observe in the light curve of # 113 .",
    "it may have a mass and temperature similar to the other ooi stars , but it is more luminous . with high quality light curves based on ccd observations , it is becoming possible to distinguish between different models .",
    "our analysis of the rr lyrae stars in @xmath0 cen has confirmed that the cluster contains variables with the properties of both oosterhoff groups .",
    "we have also presented evidence to illustrate that both the rrc and rrab ooii variables belong to a more evolved population than the ooi variables . on the average ,",
    "the ooii variables are less massive , more luminous stars that have spent their zahb phase on the blue side of the instability strip .",
    "the same conclusion can be reached from a comparison of the first overtone pulsators in the ooi cluster m3 and the ooii cluster m55 .",
    "one explanation for this advanced evolutionary state is that their zahb masses are low because of a high mass - loss rate at the tip of the red giant branch .",
    "alternatively , it could be that the masses of their main sequence progenitors are lower and consequently , the ooii variables are older .",
    "this is the conclusion that lee & carney ( 1999b ) reached in their investigation of m2 and m3 , two clusters that have similar metallicities , but different oosterhoff types . by comparing the difference in color between the base of the giant branch and the main sequence turnoff",
    ", they estimated that the ooii cluster m2 is about 2 gyr older than the ooi cluster m3 .",
    "it is possible that the oosterhoff dichotomy in @xmath0 cen is also due to an age difference .",
    "recent studies of @xmath0 cen by hilker & richtler ( 1999 ) and hughes & wallerstein ( 2000 ) present evidence for a range in age of at least 3 gyr .",
    "both groups performed strmgren photometry ( hilker & richtler observed red giants and hughes & wallerstein observed stars near the main sequence turnoff ) and both found that the more metal rich stars are at least 3 gyr younger .",
    "the data listed in tables 4 and 5 of the present paper indicate that the ooi rr lyrae variables in @xmath0 cen are more metal rich than the ooii variables .",
    "thus if the age - metallicity correlation can be extended to hb stars , a difference in age may be the cause of the oosterhoff dichotomy in @xmath0 cen .",
    "an examination of dorman s ( 1992 ) oxygen - enhanced models for hb stars with [ fe / h]=@xmath113 and @xmath114 ( metallicities comparable to those observed in the @xmath0 cen rr lyraes ) shows that at @xmath115 ( a temperature appropriate for the instability strip ) , there are models with [ fe / h ] = @xmath114 and @xmath116 that are less massive than models with [ fe / h]=-1.48 .",
    "however , the mass difference between the two is less than @xmath117 .",
    "the mass differences listed in tables 4 and 5 are greater .",
    "clearly , there is still more work to be done before we can fully understand the evolution of rr lyrae variables and the oosterhoff dichotomy .",
    "we would like to thank giuseppe bono , bruce carney , marcio catelan , johanna jurcsik , andy layden , geza kovcs , joergen petersen , robert rood , horace smith and allen sweigert for discussing this work during the course of the investigation .",
