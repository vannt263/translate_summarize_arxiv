    "the galactic plane monitoring performed by the integral satellite has led to the discovery of a number of new high mass x ",
    "ray binaries ( hmxbs ) in the last 5  years @xcite .",
    "several of these new sources are transients associated with ob supergiants and show short outbursts ( a few hours , as observed with integral , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these sources have been called supergiant fast x  ray transients ( sfxts ) , and their x  ray transient behavior is quite surprising since neutron stars accreting from the winds of supergiant companions were known to be persistent . since their bright x  ray emission , reaching 10@xmath0  erg  s@xmath1 , is concentrated in very short outbursts , they are difficult to discover , but sfxts may be a large ( and probably predominant ) population of massive x  ray binaries . their quiescent level has been observed so far only in a few sources : igr  j17544@xmath42619 @xcite and igr  j08408@xmath44503 @xcite ) , and is at about 10@xmath2  erg  s@xmath1 , thus making sfxts a class of transients with a large dynamic range ( @xmath3@xmath8 ) . among them ,",
    "particularly interesting is the case of igr  j112155952 , which is the only sfxt to date which displays periodic outbursts @xcite with a period of 329 days ( or a half of this , as recently discovered with _",
    "swift_/xrt ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the _ swift _ monitoring during the 2007 february outburst of igr  j11215@xmath45952   represents the deepest and most complete set of x  ray observations of an outburst from an sfxt , allowed thanks to the predictable behavior of the recurrent outbursts @xcite .",
    "these observations demonstrated that the accretion phase during the bright outburst lasts longer than previously thought : a few days instead of hours , with only the brightest phase lasting less than one day , and being characterized by a large variability with several flares lasting from a few minutes to a few hours @xcite .",
    "these observations allowed us to propose an alternative explanation for the sfxt outburst mechanism , which accounts for both the narrow shape of the igr  j112155952 x  ray lightcurve and the periodicity in the outburst recurrence .",
    "this model suggests the possible presence of a preferential plane in the wind mass loss from the supergiant , an equatorial wind `` disk '' , which should also be inclined with respect to the orbital plane of the binary system to explain the shortness of the outburst @xcite : in this framework , x  ray outbursts are produced when the neutron star crosses this equatorial disk component , which is denser and slower than the `` polar '' wind component .",
    "thus , depending on the truncation of the disk , its orientation and inclination with respect to the orbital plane , together with the system eccentricity , the neutron star will cross once or twice the disk , resulting in periodic or quasi - periodic outbursts .",
    "this implies that basically _ all _ sfxts should display a periodicity in the outburst recurrence , or a double periodicity , depending on the different possible geometries discussed in @xcite .",
    "we note that this scenario attempts to describe in a coherent way not only sfxt outbursts but also hmxbs as a class .    stimulated by these _ swift _ results on igr  j11215@xmath45952 we are performing the first sensitive wide - band x ",
    "ray monitoring campaign of the activity of a sample of sfxts .",
    "a sensitive monitoring campaign carried out as frequently as possible and spanning very long timescales is crucial to fully characterize the behavior of sfxts , to determine the properties of their quiescent state ( where the accumulation of large observing time is needed to allow a meaningful spectral analysis of this faintest emission ) , to monitor the onset of the outbursts and measure the outburst recurrence period(s ) .",
    "determination of the outburst pattern is fundamental in order to discover the supposed periodicities ( or quasi - periodicities ) implied by our proposed model . a positive ( or negative ) result will be possible only after several months of observations ( for example , the period for the outburst recurrence in igr  j112155952 is @xmath3165  days )",
    "this will allow us to reach a firm conclusion about periodic or non - periodic behavior .",
    "a monitoring with these aims is now possible only with the _ swift _ satellite , which offers a good sensitivity combined with a broad - band coverage ( from optical / uv to hard x  rays ) and , most importantly , a unique flexibility .",
    "this latter becomes crucial when observing transients with short outbursts , in order to rapidly modify the original schedule when they show indications of an imminent outburst ( possible `` bounces '' in the light curve , which would normally be missed ) , to catch not only the ourburst but also its onset .",
    "here we report on the results of the first four months of this on - going campaign with _ swift _ , which targeted the following sources : igr  j16479@xmath44514 , xte  j1739@xmath4302 , igr  j17544@xmath42619 and igr  j18410@xmath40535 ( see @xcite and references therein , for an updated review of the parameters of these systems ) .",
    "the targets have been selected considering sources which , among several candidates of this newly discovered class of sources , are confirmed sfxts , i.e.  they display both a `` short '' transient ( and recurrent ) x  ray activity and they have been optically identified with supergiant companions ( see references in @xcite ) . in particular , xte  j1739 - 302 and igr  j17544@xmath42619 are generally considered prototypical sfxts : xte  j1739@xmath4302 was the first transient which showed an unusual x  ray behavior @xcite , only recently optically associated with a blue supergiant @xcite .",
    "igr  j16479@xmath44514 has displayed in the past a more frequent x  ray outburst occurrence than other sfxts , ( see , e.g. walter et al .",
    "2007 ) , and offers an _ a priori _ better chance to be caught during an outburst .",
    "ax  j1841.0@xmath40536/igr  j18410@xmath40535 , on the other hand , is an interesting source which , together with igr  j112155952 , is the only sfxt where a pulsar has been detected @xcite and which may offer the opportunity to determine the orbital parameters from the pulsar timing on long timescales .",

    "we report here on the results of the first sensitive long term x  ray monitoring of sfxt lightcurves , performed with _ swift _ , focussing on the out - of - outburst x  ray behavior .",
    "the first months of these observations of a sample of four transients reveal that they spend most of the time in a low - level x  ray activity which is far from being a true quiescent state .",
    "all four of these sources display , outside the bright outbursts , a highly variable low level x  ray activity , characterized by a flaring behavior with a large dynamic range : more than one order of magnitude for all the sources .",
    "the average spectra of this x  ray emission are characterized by hard powerlaw photon indexes ( in the range 12 ) , high absorbing column densities , and average fluxes which translate into x  ray luminosities of a few 10@xmath5  erg  s@xmath1 ( see table  [ sfxts : tab : spectra ] ) , assuming the distances optically determined by @xcite ) , up to an average level of 68@xmath1110@xmath6  erg  s@xmath1 observed in igr  j16479@xmath44514 .",
    "previous x  ray observations of sfxts outside outbursts consist of a few short exposures with asca , _",
    "swift_/xrt , _ chandra _ , xmm-_newton _ , which were not part of a systematic monitoring campaign . during these observations",
    "the true quiescent state was caught in igr  j17544@xmath42619 @xcite , in igr  j08408@xmath44503 @xcite , and probably in xte  j1739@xmath4302 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this quiescence is characterized by a luminosity of about 10@xmath2  erg  s@xmath1 , and by a very soft spectrum : for example , in igr  j17544@xmath42619 , the fit with a power law resulted in a photon index of almost 6 @xcite .",
    "the kind of low - level activity we observe now with _",
    "swift _ on long timescales of months , has only been observed before in single short exposures targeted on igr  j17544@xmath42619 @xcite and on xte  j1739@xmath4302 @xcite , during observations which covered only a few tens of ks .",
    "our _ swift _ monitoring campaign , after four months of observations ( on average 12ks of net exposure per source twice or three times a week depending on the source ) , has already demonstrated that accretion at a low level rate is a very frequent and more typical state in sfxts , and that instead the quiescence seems to be a much rarer behavior for these sources than previously thought .",
    "these findings firmly establish that sfxts can not be considered as sources which undergo long periods of quiescence only occasionally interrupted by the sudden accretion of matter from the wind of the supergiant companion .",
    "instead , they continue accreting matter even when they are not in outburst , over long timescales of months , with a large variability in the x  ray flux .",
    "we measured the pulsar period in xrt data of the sfxt igr  j18410@xmath40535 . compared with the period determined in asca data by @xcite",
    ", there is evidence for a spin - up trend , with a pulse period difference of @xmath21p=@xmath40.0386@xmath22  s , and an average period derivative , p , of @xmath23  s  s@xmath1 , between the two determinations separated by @xmath32965  days .",
    "since the orbital parameters are unknown , it is not possible to correct for the doppler delay due to the orbital motion in the binary system .",
    "moreover , a spin - up trend is often observed in hmxbs ( see e.g. @xcite ) induced by the accretion torque @xcite , thus at this stage it is not possible to discriminate between the two effects . to estimate the maximum possible shift on the pulse period due to the orbit",
    ", we can assume that the pulsar is orbiting near to the surface of the ob supergiant companion ; in this case the shift is about 0.2% difference between the two period measurements , which is less than what we observe , thus a good fraction of the pulse period change is real .",
    "more determinations of the spin period are needed to characterize the orbit , and will hopefully be available in the next months of this observing campaign . on the other hand ,",
    "besides the large intensity variability and hard spectral properties , this is a further confirmation of the fact that this source is still accreting matter even at much lower rates than in outburst .",
    "the main hypotheses proposed to explain the sfxts behavior ( especially their outburst durations ) are based on the structure of the wind of the ob supergiant companions .",
    "int zand ( 2005 ) originally proposed that the sudden accretion of material from the clumpy wind of the supergiant could give rise to the bright short outbursts .",
    "negueruela et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggested that sfxts orbits should be highly eccentric to explain the low luminosity in quiescence .",
    "more recently , the idea of a clumpy and spherically symmetric wind has been associated with an eccentric and/or wide orbit ( walter & zurita heras 2007 , @xcite ) . for these authors",
    "the main difference between the sfxts and the persistent hmxb depends on the number of clumps encountered and accreted by the compact object along its orbit : in persistent systems the rate is very high because the orbit lies within @xmath32 stellar radii from the supergiant , while in the sfxts the orbit probably lies at higher distances , in a region where the wind clumps density is much lower .",
    "@xcite suggest that outside this radius the space is effectively void , and the probability for the neutron star to accrete a wind clump very low . in this model",
    "the sfxt outbursts are produced by the accretion of a single clump and the x  ray luminosity can be used to determine the mass of the clump , knowing the flare duration @xcite . in this case , the mass of the single clumps accreted to explain the low level flaring activity we observe with _ swift _ should be about two orders of magnitude lower than during the bright outburst ( where the luminosity exceeds 10@xmath0  erg  s@xmath1 ) , assuming the same flare duration .",
    "a second hypothesis has been proposed by @xcite and is based on the shape of the lightcurve observed during the 2007 outburst from the unique sfxt displaying periodic outbursts , igr  j11215@xmath45952 .",
    "this set of observations clearly demonstrated that the sfxts outbursts can not be produced by the accretion of a single clump , nor by a spherical distribution of clumps .",
    "the x  ray lightcurve of the 2007 february outburst was too narrow and steep to be explained by an enhanced accretion rate when the neutron star approaches the periastron passage orbiting a supergiant with a spherically symmetric wind , even in a binary system with an extremely high eccentricity .",
    "this strongly suggested some degree of anisotropy in the supergiant wind , which could be explained by the presence of a second denser wind component ( besides the polar spherically symmetric wind ) in the form of an equatorial wind `` disk '' from the supergiant donor .",
    "the shortness of the outburst is also indicative of an equatorial wind which is inclined with respect to the orbital plane .",
    "a flaring activity was detected and could be explained with a wind that is inhomogeneous in addition to being anisotropic @xcite .    basically , the main difference between the two hypotheses resides indeed in the spherical ( e.g. @xcite ) vs.   anisotropic wind @xcite . in both models",
    "the low - level x  ray activity could be explained : in the first scenario , it could probably be produced by clumps with a distribution of sizes and masses ( breakup of clumps to smaller sizes at larger distances in the eccentric case , or a distribution of clump sizes in the non - eccentric case ) , while in the anisotropic wind scenario the low level x  ray emission is very easily explained by the fact that the neutron star , when not undergoing a bright outburst , is not crossing the `` disk '' wind component from the supergiant donor , but in any case accretes matter from the polar supergiant wind , which is faster and two orders of magnitude less dense than the equatorial wind component .",

    "<S> this monitoring demonstrates that these transients spend most of the time accreting matter , although at a much lower level ( @xmath31001000 times lower ) than during the bright outbusts , and that the `` true quiescence '' , characterized by a soft spectrum and a luminosity of a few 10@xmath2  erg  s@xmath1 , observed in the past only in a couple of members of this class , is probably a very rare state . </S>"
