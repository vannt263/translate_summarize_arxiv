    "pulsars are often depicted as relatively simple objects : a highly magnetized , fast rotating neutron star ( ns ) emitting radiation along its poles .",
    "most emission models start from this basic picture , in principle common to all isolated pulsars .",
    "the rotation of the magnetic dipole induces an electric field near the polar caps in vacuum , which is then short circuited by an e@xmath7 pair plasma ( ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) , or in space - charge limited flow , which is screened at a pair formation front ( arons & scharlemann 1979 ) .",
    "models seek then suitable regions of particle acceleration .",
    "although the radio emission is thought to originate in the polar regions of the magnetosphere ( e.g michel 1991 and references therein ) , the high - energy emission is now thought to originate from the outer magnetosphere , with the original polar cap concept ( daugherty & harding 1996 ) having been superseded by outer - gap ( cheng , ho & ruderman 1986 ; romani 1996 ) and slot - gap ( arons 1983 , muslimov & harding 2004 ) models .",
    "the picture that has emerged is that radiation is emitted in a continuous , very broad , spectral range , with curvature radiation producing most of the gev emission ( romani 1996 ) and synchrotron and/or compton scattering by cascade products producing the near - infrared to soft @xmath0-ray  emission ( takata & chang 2007 , harding et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the high energy emission properties of pulsars were revealed in the 1990s when use of the egret experiment on the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ ( e.g. thompson , 2001 and references therein ) led to the multiwavelength spectral characterization of half a dozen @xmath0-ray  pulsars , including the discovery of the radio - quiet pulsar geminga ( halpern & holt 1992 ) , the second brightest steady gev source in the @xmath0-ray  sky . amongst",
    "the egret legacy was a sample of 170 unidentified sources , 74 of which are at @xmath8 ( hartmann et al .",
    "it has now been found that @xmath9 egret unidentified sources have counterparts in the _ fermi _  large area telescope ( lat ) first year catalog ( abdo et al . 2010b ; 1fgl ) and a large fraction of those lying on the galactic plane turned out to be pulsars ( abdo et al .",
    "2008 , 2009a , 2009b , 2010a , 2010b ) , a result anticipated by several authors ( yadigaroglu & romani 1995 , cheng & zhang 1998 , harding & muslimov 2005 ) .",
    "in fact , it is very plausible that many more radio - loud or radio - quiet pulsars are hidden in the unidentified galactic lat sources , although estimates are highly dependent on details of the different emission mechanisms . at this point",
    "it is still unclear what makes some @xmath0-ray  pulsars radio - loud and some radio - quiet .",
    "understanding the distinct properties of the individual sources will surely lead to a better understanding of models for the emission mechanisms , for example , the connection between the radio and the near - infrared to the @xmath0-ray  component .",
    "the source 2cg 078 + 2 was one of about twenty @xmath0-ray  sources detected by the _ cos - b _",
    "satellite 30 years ago ( swanenburg et al . 1981 ) .",
    "the source is in the line of sight towards the supernova remnant g78.2 + 2.1 .",
    "the remnant comprises a 1-degree - diameter , circular , radio shell with two bright and broad opposing arcs on its rim ( higgs , landecker & roger 1977 , wendker , higgs & landecker 1991 ) .",
    "the remnant has a kinetic distance of about 1.5 kpc ( landecker , roger , and higgs 1980 ; green 2009 ) and is estimated to have an age of 5400 yr ( sturner & dermer 1995 ) .",
    "2cg 078 + 2 is often cited as @xmath0-cygni due to its proximity to the second magnitude foreground star ( m@xmath10 = 2.2 , spectral type f8iab ) that lies on the eastern edge of the remnant although there is no other physical association between the supernova remnant ( snr ) and the star .",
    "a small hii region , located close to the star , forms the @xmath0-cygni nebula .    the @xmath0-ray  source , next cataloged as 3eg j2020 + 4017 ( hartmann et al . 1999 ) ,",
    "was suspected to be either extended emission from the snr or a pulsar formed in the supernova event ( sturner & dermer 1996 ) . soon after its june 2008 launch , the _ fermi _",
    "@xmath0-ray  space telescope highlighted the discovery of a radio - quiet pulsar in the cta-1 snr ( abdo et al .",
    "2008 ) as a first light result .",
    "this was followed by the discovery of twenty - three other @xmath0-ray  pulsars using blind search techniques ( abdo et al .",
    "2009b , saz parkinson et al .",
    "2010 ) , among them psr j2021 + 4026  lying within the egret error circle of 3eg j2020 + 4017 .",
    "psr j2021 + 4026  is a 265-ms pulsar with a spin - down age of 77 kyr and a total spin - down luminosity of 1.1@xmath11 erg / s .",
    "interestingly , most of the pulsars discovered by the lat with blind searches have not been seen at other wavelengths .",
    "in fact , only three of the 26 discovered to date have been detected in radio ( camilo et al . 2009 ; abdo et  al .",
    "2010c )    even before the _ fermi _  discovery of pulsations , and because the egret @xmath0-ray  properties of the source matched those of known @xmath0-ray - pulsars ( hard , steady and in the galactic plane ) , the search for the radio and x - ray counterpart of this source began ( brazier et al .",
    "1996 ; becker et al .",

    "we have previously ( becker et al .",
    "2004 , weisskopf et al .",
    "2006 ) performed _ chandra _  observations ( obsids 3856 & 5533 ) aimed at different portions of the @xmath0-cygni field and these pointings were based on the best known @xmath0-ray  positions available at the time .",
    "the latter _ chandra _  observation , obsid  5533 , overlapped with about 3/4 of the _ current _ fermi - lat 99%-confidence positional error circle and detected several potential x - ray counterparts , including the source designated as `` s21 '' as reported in weisskopf et al .",
    "subsequently , trepl et al .",
    "( 2010 ) reanalyzed the available _ chandra _  data and also used xmm - newton data to search for a counterpart .",
    "they identify source 2xmm  j202131 + 402645 , at virtually the same location as the _ chandra _  source `` s21 '' , as the likely counterpart because the x - ray source position fell within the @xmath154-radius fermi - lat 95%-confidence positional error circle at the time ( 0fgl , abdo et al .",
    "we note that the most recent fermi - lat error circle radius ( 2fgl , abdo et al .",
    "2011 ) is 0.6  (  3 ) and no longer includes `` s21 '' .",
    "we re - evaluate the situation using both the greatly improved lat source localization and the position measured from timing of psr j2021 + 4026 .",
    "the current work describes a new observation that completes the _ chandra _  coverage of the field . as a result of these observations ,",

    "moreover , we also show that the x - ray source is dominated by thermal , not powerlaw , emission . in this regard ,",
    "it is interesting to compare this source with geminga , one of the best studied radio - quiet @xmath0-ray  pulsars , which is older ( 340 ky ) and less luminous ( @xmath16 erg / s ) than psr j2021 + 4026  but has a similar period and period derivative .    ",

    "source # 20 is consistent with being pointlike .",
    "we used the xspec ( v.12.5 ) spectral - fitting package ( arnaud , 1996 ) to perform spectral fits to the 44 x - ray point sources .",
    "we treat source # 20 separately in  [ s : s20_spectrum ] .",
    "data were binned to obtain at least 10 counts per spectral bin before background subtraction .",
    "the background was determined after masking off a circular region around each of the 44 detected x - ray sources corresponding to a circle of radius 25 times the uncertainty listed in column 6 of table  [ t : data_x ] and then averaging over the remaining pixels .",
    "individual response matrix and ancillary response files appropriate to each source position were created for this analysis using the mkacisrmf and mkarf tools available in ciao version 4.2 .",
    "a sufficient number of counts were detected from source # 20 to perform more extensive spectral analysis .",
    "figure  [ f : s20_spectrum ] shows the x - ray spectrum of source # 20 with background subtracted .",
    "data were again binned to obtain at least 10 counts per bin before background subtraction . the background is less than 3% of the signal plus background from the region that includes source # 20 .",
    "we begin our spectral analysis by first considering single - component spectral models ( table  [ t : smodels ] ) with a multiplicative absorption component : an absorbed power law ( powerlaw in xspec ) ; an absorbed black body ( bbodyrad ) ; and three different absorbed neutron star atmosphere models , is assumed throughout for purposes of computing effects of gravitational redshift in the neutron star atmosphere models ] namely , nsa ( pavlov et al . 1995 ) , nsmax-1260 and nsmax-130190 ( ho , potekhin & chabrier 2008 ) .",
    "for computing absorption , we utilized abundances ( xspec s wilm ) from wilms , allen , & mccray ( 2000 ) with cross - sections ( vern ) from verner et al.(1993 ) and allowed for interstellar extinction by grains using the model ( tbabs ) of wilms , allen , & mccray ( 2000 ) .",
    "all of these models provide statistically adequate fits to the data in the 0.5 - 8.0 kev range ( table  [ t : smodels ] ) .",
    "( we note that so did a fit to an absorbed mekal model . ) from the hi in the galaxy ( dickey & lockman , 1990 ) , one infers a column density @xmath31  @xmath32 through the galaxy in the direction of source # 20 , implying that values below this should be expected if there is no circumstellar absorption , and this is indeed the case ( table  [ t : smodels ] ) .",
    "next we posit that the very steep power law index of almost 5 is not physical , but indicative of a soft , thermal component .",
    "the bbodyrad model s normalization , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the radius of the emitting area in km and @xmath35 is the distance to the source in units of 10  kpc , corresponds to an emitting area of @xmath36 , assuming the association of the pulsar with g78.2 + 2.1 at a nominal distance of @xmath37 .",
    "this is much smaller than a typical ns radius , but not very different than the standard polar cap radius , @xmath38 which for @xmath39  s and @xmath40  km is 0.42  km .",
    "conversely , if we assume the emission comes from a ns with a characteristic radius of 13 km , then the bbodyrad norm implies a source distance of @xmath41 kpc , well outside the galaxy .",
    "this distance estimate drops for the different ns - atmosphere models , e.g. down to 13 kpc ( table  [ t : smodels ] ) , still somewhat distant to remain within the galaxy .",
    "in addition , the temperature estimates of the ( cooling ) ns , range from @xmath42 to @xmath43 , with the precise value depending on the model ( table  [ t : smodels ] ) . these estimates are consistent with those expected for a pulsar of an estimated age somewhere between 5400 and 77000 years , depending of course on the equation of state , composition of the heat - blanketing envelope , and the degree of superfluidity in the star s core .",
    "( see yakovlev et al .",
    "2010 and references therein for recent details on the subject of cooling nss . )",
    "we then ask whether or not combining a power law with the other models is indicated by the data .",
    "table  [ t : dmodels ] tabulates the change in @xmath18 , the f - statistic , and the probability that combining models has significantly improved the quality of the fit .",
    "the table also tabulates he derived spectral parameters . in all cases combining various thermal models with a power law",
    "does improve the quality of the fit with a confidence better than 2-sigma , but not 3-sigma .",
    "moreover , these two - component models allow a wide latitude for the uncertainties of the best - fit parameters and hence these parameters are not as constrained as one might wish .",
    "this follows from the fact that all of the single models ( table  [ t : smodels ] ) themselves provide statistically adequate fits .",
    "thus , the 3-sigma contours for any two - component model allows for one or the other of the component models to have a zero norm ",
    "e.g. a power law component is not completely _ required _ by the data at this level of significance . keeping this proviso in mind",
    ", we continue to examine the two - component models .",
    "certainly the physical interpretation of the data is perhaps more sensible when both components are introduced , especially in light of the strong @xmath0-ray  emission which can not arise from any single - component `` thermal '' model spectrum .",
    "in addition , both the inferred ns temperatures and distances implied by the two - component models ( table  [ t : dmodels ] ) , with the possible exception of the bbodyrad+powerlaw model , are consistent with what one might expect for a young cooling neutron star within the galaxy .",
    "the considerations of the single - component models in the previous section lead one to conclude that we are perhaps seeing a hot spot of size comparable to the polar cap rather than thermal emission from the entire surface of the neutron star and with a temperature higher than one expects from cooling of a neutron star at an age @xmath44 years .",
    "it is thus possible that the bulk of the emission comes from heating of the polar cap by backflowing accelerated particles .",
    "the expected luminosity and temperature from heating by positrons produced by curvature radiation of primaries in a space - charge limited flow model is @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( harding & muslimov 2001 ) .",
    "this luminosity is deposited over an area roughly that of the polar cap and radiated on a timescale less then the heat diffusion timescale across field lines to other areas of the ns .",
    "the temperature @xmath47 is close to that determined from the bbodyrad and nsa model fits allowing for the gravitational redshift .",
    "it is therefore quite possible that the x - ray emission from psr j2021 + 4026 is dominated by polar cap heating .    on the other hand , many well - studied neutron stars that exhibit both x - ray and @xmath0-ray  emission have composite x - ray spectra , showing non - thermal power law magnetospheric emission and/or hot polar cap emission in addition to the lower - temperature full surface thermal emission ( e.g. geminga , psr b0665 + 14 , psr b1055 - 52 , see de luca et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "while the present data quality do not demand such two - component models , the inferred distances from such two - component fits , e.g. , @xmath48  kpc for the ns atmosphere models ( table  [ t : dmodels ] ) become reasonable for plausible stellar radii assuming full surface emission . this distance is larger than the kinematic distance to the snr  78.2@xmath42.1 of 1.5  kpc but is comparable to the distance to the cygnus arm at galactic longitude @xmath1578 .",
    "thus , it is possible that a two - component model , with full - surface cooling and magnetospheric power law emission present at lower levels , might be needed to accurately describe the emission physics . in practice ,",
    "decomposing such complex x - ray spectra requires good statistics and phase - resolved x - ray spectroscopy . for a target",
    "this faint , extremely long observations or next - generation x - ray satellites are clearly required .",
    "there are similarities and differences between the x - ray spectrum of psr j2021 + 4026  and two of the other radio - quiet @xmath0-ray  pulsars with detected x - ray emission , geminga and cta 1 .",
    "first psr j2021 + 4026 , like geminga ( jackson and halpern , 2005 ) and cta 1 ( caraveo et al .",
    "2010 ) , may also be characterized by two spectral components , a thermal component and power law . in geminga",
    ", however , the power law component begins to dominate above about 0.5 kev and @xmath49 is about 5.7 . for psr j2021",
    "+ 4026  the power law dominates above 2.5 kev and @xmath49 is higher , as one would expect as psr j2021 + 4026 , based on its spin - down age , is younger .",
    "the spectral indices for the power law components for source # 20 and geminga are not dissimilar , but one needs to recognize the large uncertainty in the measurements reported here .",
    "another , possibly important , spectral difference between the two x - ray spectra is that , in the case of geminga , the blackbody component gives an emission radius that is plausible for a ns radius .",
    "this is not so for psr j2021 + 4026 . in this case",
    ", the neutron star atmosphere models seem to yield more physically reasonable parameters than the bbodyrad+powerlaw model .",
    "if we assume that the younger and hotter star still has an atmosphere while the older geminga does not , then these results are sensible .",
    "finally , there is a weak extended emission feature near source # 20 that may be indicative of a pwn . if so , then it extends no more than 0.04 to 0.17  pc from source # 20 ( assuming a distance of 1.5 to 6.0  kpc , respectively ) and contributes @xmath157% of the x - ray counts detected from source # 20 and its surroundings .",
    "emission associated with the geminga pwn has a similar extent and contributes  10% of the non - thermal x - ray flux of the pulsar , but only about 1% of the total flux ( pavlov et  al .",
    "2010 ) .    for cta 1 , the measured temperature ,",
    "powerlaw index and emission radius are @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 km for a powerlaw+bbodyrad model , and @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 km for powerlaw+nsa , with slightly lower @xmath18 for the former ( caraveo et al .",
    "2010 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the emitting radius is significantly smaller than a standard ns radius .",
    "thus , similar to psr j2021 + 4026 , cta-1 shows a possible heated polar cap component , with a temperature very close to the model prediction of @xmath56 ( harding & muslimov 2001 ) , however , the emitting radius in this case is a factor of 2.5 larger than the polar cap radius .",
    "cta 1 does not show evidence for a cool component , with the upper limits making it unusually cool for its age .",
    "the _ fermi_-lat normally localizes @xmath0-ray  sources using the incident @xmath0-ray  photon directions .",

    "( 2011 ) .",
    "the position determination from timing of this pulsar is hampered by the large contribution from rotational instabilities common in young pulsars and manifest as `` timing noise '' .",
    "therefore , we have taken two different approaches to try to confirm the association between psr j2021 + 4026  and source # 20 . for this analysis",
    ", we used @xmath0  rays  detected by the lat from 2008 aug 4 to 2011 mar 12 , selecting only those within @xmath58 from the previous best position ( ray et al .",

    "we chose only photons belonging to the most restrictive `` diffuse '' class according to the `` pass  6 '' instrument response functions ( see atwood et al .",
    "2009 ) , which have the lowest background contamination .",
    "furthermore , we selected only photons with a zenith angle of @xmath59 , to reduce contamination due to secondary - atmospheric @xmath0  rays .",
    "as a first test , we evaluate the significance of the @xmath0-ray  pulsations by assuming the pulsar is at each of the candidate x - ray source locations seen in our chandra observation ( table  [ t : data_x ] ) .   for each candidate location",
    ", we transform arrival times to the barycenter using the x - ray position and then use the prepfold routine from the presto pulsar package ( ransom , eikenberry & middleditch 2002 ) to find the frequency ( @xmath60 ) , and its first and second derivatives , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which maximize the statistical significance of the pulsation . figure  [ f : pulse_timing ] shows the results from this exploratory search , where it is clear that source # 20 gives the maximum significance for pulsation using this algorithm .",
    "this indicates that of the possible x - ray sources in the field , source # 20 is the most likely x - ray counterpart .",
    "next , we use pulsar timing to fit for the position of the pulsar , as described in ray et al .",
    "we measured 55 times of arrival ( toas ) based on 22-day integrations spanning the data set described above .",
    "the typical uncertainty on each toa measurement was 4.7 ms .",

    ", we observe very large residuals and the @xmath63 of the fit is very poor .",
    "this poor model fit means that the statistical errors in the fitted right ascension and declination reported by tempo2 are unreliable . to get an estimate of the systematic error in the position fit , we use the following procedure .",
    "we added 5 so - called `` wave '' terms to the timing model to account for the timing noise using harmonically - related sinusoids ( hobbs et al .",
    "we then perform a fine scan over a positional grid around the location of source # 20 .",
    "holding the position fixed at each grid point , we fit for the spin and wave parameters .",
    "the grid position with the lowest resulting @xmath18 for the fit is r.a .",
    "20@xmath121@xmath229@xmath3.683 , decl .  @xmath4402654.61  ( j2000 ) .",
    "this new timing position is @xmath64 away from the one reported in ray et al .",
    "( 2011 ) which was based on 14 fewer months of data .",
    "based on the @xmath18 map over the grid , we estimate the 95% confidence region of the new timing position to be an ellipse of dimensions 26@xmath6510 , as shown in figure  [ f : snapshot ] .",
    "the separation between the position of source # 20 and the refined timing analysis position obtained here is @xmath66 and source # 20 lies outside the 95% confidence region .",
    "a precise evaluation of systematic timing errors is complicated by the ( erratic ) timing behavior of the pulsar itself and the relatively short data span with respect to the 1-year modulation that is introduced by an incorrect position .",
    "that is , the position can be perturbed by any component of the timing noise that appears to be a 1-year sinusoid .",
    "the magnitude of this effect is difficult to estimate because we have just one realization of the stochastic timing noise process in our data .   to see the potential contribution ,",
    "we have plotted an estimate of the timing noise contributions in figure  [ f : tnoise ] .   here , we assume that the parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 are dominated by the secular spindown of the pulsar , while any higher order frequency derivatives and all of the wave parameters are dominated by timing noise .",
    "clearly , this is a red - noise stochastic process .",
    "note that a position error of 10@xmath67 will introduce a sinusoidal term with a 1-year period and an amplitude of 24 ms . to get another estimate of the systematic error",
    ", we fit a timing model including the pulsar position to three overlapping segments of data , the first half of our data span , the middle half , and the last half .",
    "these three fitted positions are separated by 79@xmath67 , giving another estimate of the systematic error resulting from timing noise .",
    "based on these considerations , we adopt @xmath64 as an estimate of the systematic error in the timing position .",
    "combining , in quadrature , this systematic error estimate with the error estimated in ray et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) results in the smaller , 10.3  radius , circular 95% confidence region depicted in figure  [ f : snapshot ] .",
    "source # 20 lies within this region .    in summary , when using pulsar timing to derive a position at the few arcsec level it is important to allow for low frequency ( year timescale ) timing noise .",
    "we have done this two ways : first , by adding wave terms to the solution and allowing these terms to vary when deriving an error in our grid search .",
    "second , by time slicing the data and looking at how the derived position changes . as seen in figure  [",
    "f : snapshot ] , each of these methods gave similar sized error regions that overlap .",
    "as reported in weisskopf et al ( 2006 ) and repeated in  [ s : oi ] , there are no cataloged optical counterparts for source # 20 .",
    "this is not surprising as , with the exception of the @xmath68 crab , most optically detected pulsars have magnitudes @xmath69 .",
    "in addition the field of psr j2021 + 4026  is crowded and optical observations are further hampered by the presence of the 8@xmath70 magnitude star bd+39 4152 ( = v405 cyg ) one arcmin away to the east .",
    "we present here observations of the field taken on october 31 , 2008 with the optic orthogonal frame - transfer camera on the kit peak national observatory , 3.6 m , wisconsin , yale , indiana , & noao ( hence wiyn ) telescope . the optic camera , with a 10@xmath71 field and plate scale 0.141@xmath72/pixel , allows improved image quality through `` orthogonal transfer '' ( ot ) rapid electronic guiding following motions of a reference star ( tonry et al .",
    "we used bd+39 4152 itself as the guide star and were able to correct at 50hz , collecting @xmath73s dithered exposures in @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "these frames were subject to standard calibrations , except for the flat field frames which were assembled by applying image shifts matching those of the ot guiding during the individual science exposures .",
    "the resulting image stacks have final psf widths of 0.87@xmath72 ( @xmath74 ) and 0.62@xmath72 ( @xmath75 ) near the guide star ; the psf width increases by @xmath76% toward the edge of the frame .",
    "we estimate that the frame is aligned to the _ chandra _  coordinates with @xmath77 precision .",
    "figure  [ f : wiyn_r2_i2 ] shows a portion of the optic frames in @xmath74 and @xmath75 centered near the position of source # 20 .",
    "note the secondary reflections of bd+39 4152 and the strong scattering background , especially in @xmath75 .",
    "magnitudes were corrected to the sdss photometry scale using observations of the calibration star ru 149f ( smith et al . 2002 ) .",
    "we measured the fluxes of the faintest detectable stellar sources in the vicinity of our target position and used these to estimate upper limits ( @xmath78% confidence ) on the undetected optical flux for source # 20 of @xmath79 mag ( the sensitivity is severely limited by scattered flux ) and @xmath80  mag .",
    "some of the diffuse emission toward the right ( west ) of the @xmath74 image is part of larger scale filamentary structure visible over several arcminutes .",
    "this is likely h@xmath81/[nii ] associated with the @xmath0  cygni  snr itself .",
    "we note that this remnant has been poorly studied in the optical .",
    "mavromatakis ( 2003 ) described extensive diffuse line emission over a @xmath82 region , but found little filamentary emission and was not able to detect the very faint filaments seen in our data .",
    "no corresponding x - ray structure is seen , supporting the claim in mavromatakis ( 2003 ) that the @xmath0  cygni  remnant is dominated by low velocity shocks .",
    "deep narrow band imaging to trace this structure could be useful in testing the connection , if any , between psr j2021 + 4026 and the @xmath0  cygni  snr .",
    "there is a drop in the _ chandra _  energy response above the mirror coating s iridium - m edges ( @xmath83  kev ) , thus any source with a substantial fraction of its detected photons above 2  kev is indicative of a very hard spectrum .",
    "figure  [ f : hratio ] shows the x - ray color - color diagram for the 21 sources that have more than 15 source counts .",
    "the diagram comprises 3 bands : s ( soft ) covering 0.5 to 1.0 kev ; m ( medium ) covering 1.0 to 2.0 and h ( hard ) 2 to 8 kev with t ( total ) simply the sum of s , m and h. the color ratios that comprise figure  [ f : hratio ] are given in columns 8 & 9 of table  [ t : data_x ] .",
    "the x coordinate in figure  [ f : hratio ] ( h - s)/t measures how hard the spectrum is and the y coordinate ( m / t ) measures how centrally peaked the spectrum is .",
    "positive source counts requires data points to be inside the triangle , but background subtraction causes a few to appear slightly outside .",
    "sources with ( h - s)/t greater than 0.5 are spectrally very hard and are likely background agns shining through the galactic plane .",
    "only one of this group of sources , # 42 , has a cataloged optical counterpart ( table  [ t : data_oi ] ) .",
    "sources with negative values of ( h - s)/t likely have thermal spectra and are plausibly lightly absorbed foreground stars . note that source # 20 has the highest fraction of counts in the 1 - 2 kev band .",
    "two x - ray sources , other than source # 20 , have sufficient counts to warrant a spectral analysis : # 3 , the brightest in the field ; and # 32 .",
    "we first fit the source  # 3 data using absorbed powerlaw , bbodyrad , and mekal models .",
    "none of these models provided acceptable fits to the data , @xmath18  being 48.3 , 57.2 , 70.8 , respectively , for 32 degrees of freedom .",
    "the only two - component+ model that provided an acceptable fit was a two - temperature mekal model with @xmath18  of 23.4 for 30 degrees of freedom , further indicating that this is a foreground star .",
    "the results of our spectral analysis , following the procedures discussed in  [ s : s20_spectrum ] , are in table  [ t : s3_spectrum ] .",
    "the data for source # 32 are well - fit by an absorbed powerlaw model ( @xmath18  of 15.7 for 19 degrees of freedom ) , but , as with source # 20 , the powerlaw index is very steep being 3.4 . in this case , however , neither a single - temperature mekal model nor a bbodyrad model provide as compelling fits ( @xmath18  of 46.9 & 23.9 respectively ) , although the latter is statistically acceptable .",
    "there is simply too much uncertainty to firmly classify this source on the basis of the x - ray spectroscopy alone .",
    "the general paucity of counts also precludes a sensitive time - variability analysis for almost all these sources .",
    "nonetheless , one of the three x - ray - brightest sources , # 32 , shows evidence for a significant temporal variation , suggestive of stellar coronal emission .",
    "the existence of both a likely 2mass and usno candidate counterpart ( table  [ t : data_oi ] ) reinforces this interpretation in which case simple spectral models might not be expected to fit the data , as we have seen (  [ s : s32_spectrum ] )      we searched for candidate optical counterparts to the detected x - ray sources .",

    "three additional optical counterparts to the x - ray sources were detected in the low exposure guide sector allowing improved frame registration .",

    "using the _ chandra _  x - ray observatory , we continued our search ( becker et al .",
    "2004 , weisskopf et al . 2006 ) for possible x - ray counterparts to the intriguing @xmath0-ray  source now known as psr j2021 + 4026 .",
    "we found 44 x - ray sources in a field centered on the psr j2021 + 4026  position , located along the line - of - sight toward the @xmath0-cyg snr .",
    "only one of these sources , # 20 , can reasonably and with high confidence be taken as the x - ray counterpart to the @xmath0-ray  source .",
    "there are a number of reasons supporting this conclusion .",
    "first and foremost , our x - ray source # 20 , is only 14.7  distant from the best - fitting @xmath0-ray  timing position .",
    "in addition , this separation is within the combined statistical and systematic errors on that position .",
    "there are also no other x - ray sources detected within 66  of the @xmath0-ray  source position to a _",
    "chandra _ source - detection limit of @xmath1510@xmath98 erg  @xmath32  s@xmath99 in the 0.5@xmath1008.0 kev bandpass making it highly unlikely that any of the other x - ray sources in the field are candidate counterparts .",
    "furthermore , the spectrum of source # 20 has a shape consistent with soft ( @xmath101 to @xmath102 ) thermal emission as expected from a young neutron star though perhaps somewhat higher than expected from the spin - down age of 77000  yr estimated for psr j2021 + 4026 .",
    "there is also a hint of extended diffuse x - ray emission in the vicinity of source # 20 that may be an associated pwn .",
    "with source # 20 as the counterpart , we infer @xmath103 , not atypical of young isolated neutron stars ( e.g. , becker 2009 ) . if source # 20 is not the x - ray counterpart , the flux ratio is at least 30@xmath65 larger , which would be substantially larger than the observed ratio for other @xmath0-ray  pulsars .",
    "a similar argument using the optical data also supports source # 20 as the counterpart : our r@xmath104 limit implies a lower limit of @xmath105 , with some uncertainty due to extinction .",
    "this is already larger than the maximum value for x - ray binaries ( @xmath1515 ) or bl lacs ( @xmath15100 ) and is approaching typical values for isolated neutron stars ( @xmath106 ) ( e.g. schwope et al .",
    "thus , based on the x - ray / optical evidence alone , source # 20 is likely an isolated neutron star and is the likely counterpart for psr j2021 + 4026 .    finally , the x - ray spectrum has a shape consistent with the soft thermal emission expected from a young neutron star .",
    "this emission likely represents a fraction of the stellar surface heated by back - flowing particles generated by magnetospheric activity ( eg .",
    "harding & muslimov 2001 ) . at present",
    "the fitted parameters suggest that this thermal component implies a relatively large distance , @xmath107 kpc , incompatible with an association with snr g78 + 2.1 .",
    "however , the fits also indicate a complex spectrum with at least two components ; much higher s / n data will be needed to extract strong spectral constraints .",
    "of course , a heated polar cap suggests that sensitive observations should also be able to detect x - ray pulsations at the 265  ms spin period , the definitive test of the counterpart s association .",
