    "ever since the first achievement of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in ultracold atomic gases  @xcite , matter wave solitons have been the central focus of many experimentalists and theorists  @xcite .",
    "solitons are the result of the interplay between nonlinearity and dispersion and keep their shape while traveling . in becs , nonlinearity originates from collisional interactions between atoms , which can be readily tuned via feshbach resonances  @xcite . in general , there are two types of solitons : a bright soliton with a density bump for attractive interactions and a dark soliton with a density notch and a phase jump for repulsive interactions .",
    "both bright and dark solitons have been experimentally observed in cold atoms with contact interactions  @xcite .",
    "however , for such contact attractive interactions , bright solitons can only exist in one dimension ( 1d ) , but not in two dimensions ( 2d ) where the states either collapse or expand  @xcite .",
    "different from the local nonlinearity resulting from contact interactions , the non - local nonlinearity can stabilize a 2d bright soliton  @xcite , in particular , the nonlinearity introduced by the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "this interaction is long ranged and anisotropic with the strength and sign ( i.e. repulsive or attractive ) depending on the dipole orientation . when an external rotating magnetic field is applied to reverse the sign of the interaction  @xcite , or the dipoles",
    "are completely polarized in a 2d plane  @xcite , the dipolar interaction can become attractive and 2d bright solitons can be , therefore , stabilized under appropriate conditions . it is essential to note that although the relevant interaction in common experiments with cold atomic gases is contact , increasing interest has been focused on the atoms with large magnetic moments that possess dipole - dipole interactions  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the bose - einstein condensation of several dipolar atoms such as chromium  @xcite , dysprosium  @xcite , and erbium  @xcite , as well as the degeneracy of a dipolar fermi gas  @xcite have been observed in experiments .",
    "recently , the spin - orbit coupling between two hyperfine states of cold atoms has been experimentally engineered  @xcite . and this achievement has ignited tremendous interest in this field because of the dramatic change in the single particle dispersion ( induced by spin - orbit coupling ) which in conjunction with the interaction leads to many exotic superfluids  @xcite(also see  @xcite for review ) .",
    "such change in dispersion also results in exotic solitons even when the interaction is contact , including bright solitons  @xcite , dark solitons  @xcite , and gap solitons  @xcite for becs , as well as dark solitons for fermi superfluids  @xcite .",
    "these solitons exhibit unique features that are absent without spin - orbit coupling , for instance , the plane wave profile with a spatially varying phase and the stripe profile with a spatially oscillating density for becs , as well as the presence of majorana fermions inside a soliton for fermi superfluids .",
    "also , the violation of galilean invariance  @xcite by spin - orbit coupling dictates that the structure of solitons changes with their velocities .    on the other hand , spin - orbit - coupled becs with dipole - dipole interactions  @xcite",
    "have also been explored , and intriguing quasicrystals  @xcite as well as meron states  @xcite have been found .",
    "however , whether a soliton can exist in such becs in 2d with long ranged dipole - dipole interactions and spin - orbit dispersion has not yet been investigated .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the existence and properties of a bright soliton in a two species spin - orbit - coupled dipolar bec in 2d with repulsive contact interactions via both the variational method and the imaginary time evolution of the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) .",
    "the dipoles are completely oriented along the @xmath0 direction in the 2d plane in order to provide an effective attractive dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "thanks to such attractive interactions , we find two types of solitons : a plane wave soliton ( when the repulsive intraspecies contact interaction is larger than the repulsive interspecies one ) and a stripe soliton ( when the interspecies one is larger ) .",
    "these 2d solitons as the ground states can not exist for a system with pure attractive contact interactions and spin - orbit coupling .",
    "such solitons are highly anisotropic and their size is also reduced by spin - orbit coupling . finally , we study the moving solitons , which are nontrivial because of the lack of galilean invariance .",
    "the size of a soliton first increases and then decreases with the rise of the velocity and this change is anisotropic .",
    "the moving soliton also tends to be plane wave even when its stationary counterpart has the stripe structure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the energy functional and the time - dependent gpe , which are used to describe a spin - orbit - coupled dipolar bec . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate the bright soliton by performing the minimization of the energy of the variational ansatz wave functions and an imaginary time evolution of the gpe",
    ". the properties of such soliton are also explored by the former method .",
    "then , we study the nontrivial moving solitons in sec .",

    "we consider a rashba - type spin - orbit - coupled bec and write its single particle hamiltonian as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the momentum operator , @xmath3 is the atom mass , @xmath4 is the spin - orbit coupling strength , and @xmath5 are pauli matrices .",

    "in writing down the ansatz ( [ ansatz_pw ] ) , we have assumed that the wave vector @xmath59 is in the @xmath0 direction .",
    "the prerequisite of this assumption is that the rotation symmetry  @xcite about the @xmath9 axis has been broken by the dipole - dipole interaction .",

    "this elongated configuration allows the existence of a 2d soliton  @xcite and also requires the wave vector to be along @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "although the wave vector @xmath59 of the ground state is along @xmath0 , there are still two options : negative and positive directions in terms of the time - reversal symmetry @xmath78 ( i.e. @xmath79 with the complex conjugate operator @xmath80 ) .",

    "this degeneracy may be broken by the interaction so that the ground state is either @xmath83 or @xmath84 , or a certain superposition state of them . but",
    "this degeneracy breaking should not happen at @xmath86 since the interaction energy only depends on the total density which is independent of @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",

    "for the stripe soliton , we note that @xmath91 corresponds to the ground state as the energy contributed by @xmath88 is @xmath92  @xcite .    to evaluate the variational parameters @xmath93 , @xmath55 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath87 , we minimize the energy @xmath94 after substituting @xmath95 in eq .",

    "[ movingsoliton](e ) and fig .",
    "[ movingsoliton](f ) ) when it approaches zero .",
    "[ movingsoliton](a ) and fig .",
    "[ movingsoliton](b ) demonstrate that @xmath151 suffers a sharp decline from one to near zero as @xmath152 and @xmath153 increase , indicating that a moving soliton tends to be a plane wave state .",
    "the reason is the broken rotation symmetry of the single particle hamiltonian by the velocity induced zeeman field , giving rise to a ground state of the single particle system lying at one momentum point located along the @xmath75 ( @xmath0 ) direction when the velocity is along that direction .",
    "this also explains why the phase of a moving plane wave soliton with the velocity along the @xmath75 ( @xmath0 ) direction varies along that direction .",
    "furthermore , fig .",
    "[ movingsoliton](a ) demonstrates that the width of the soliton gradually grows when the velocity along the @xmath0 direction is enlarged , to explain the growth , we consider the plane wave ansatz in eq .",
    "( [ ansatz_pw ] ) which yields an additional term @xmath155 for the single particle energy when a soliton moves ; this energy decrease enlarges exponentially with the decline of @xmath93 ( i.e. increase of the width ) , leading to an expanded soliton with the rise of the velocity . however , this is not a monotonous behavior and the soliton begins shrinking when the velocity goes larger , due to the enlarged @xmath59 by the velocity induced zeeman field , similar to increasing spin - orbit coupling . on the other hand ,",
    "when the velocity is along the @xmath75 direction , the width of the soliton gains a sudden rise as the velocity varies , as shown fig .",
    "[ movingsoliton](b ) .",
    "this corresponds to a change from a stripe soliton with the wave vector along the @xmath0 direction to a plane wave soliton with the wave vector along the @xmath75 direction . for the stationary solitons , the soliton with the wave vector mainly along the @xmath0 direction has lower energy than the one with the wave vector mainly along the @xmath75 direction as the dipoles are completely oriented along @xmath0 .",
    "but the zeeman field induced by the presence of a velocity along the @xmath75 direction gives rise to the single particle ground state that possesses the wave vector along @xmath75 .",
    "the two states with the wave vector along these two directions compete and change from the former to the latter ( i.e. first order phase transition ) . for the decrease of the width when @xmath152 goes even larger",
    ", the reason is the same as the case for @xmath153 . when a stationary soliton is plane wave , the moving behavior is similar except that the moving soliton is always the plane wave soliton .",
    "we have studied the bright solitons as the ground states in a spin - orbit - coupled dipolar bec in 2d with dipoles completely polarized along one direction in the 2d plane .",
    "it is important to note that the solitons are the ground states in 2d , but they are the metastable states in quasi-2d where the true ground state would collapse and there is an energy barrier between the soliton state and this ground state . two types of solitons have been found : a plane wave soliton and a stripe soliton .",
    "the former has the plane wave phase variation and its two components are slightly spatially separated ; while for the latter , the density of each component is spatially oscillating and the variational ansatz suggests that four points in momentum space are involved . both plane wave and stripe solitons are highly anisotropic and their size is decreased by spin - orbit coupling .",
    "these solitons can not exist as the ground states in a 2d system with pure attractive contact interactions and spin - orbit coupling .",
    "moreover , the shape of these solitons changes with their velocities due to the absence of galilean invariance , and this change is anisotropic .    the 2d bright soliton , albeit mainly plane wave soliton , can also exist when equal rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling is considered . in experiments ,",
    "this type of spin - orbit coupling has been engineered by coupling two hyperfine states of atoms through two counterpropagating raman laser beams  @xcite and such setup could be employed to realize this spin - orbit coupling in dysprosium  @xcite with large dipole - dipole interactions .",
