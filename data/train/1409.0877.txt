    "the _ ab initio _ theoretical description of light nuclei is based on direct solution of the nuclear many - body problem given realistic nucleon - nucleon interactions . in no - core",
    "configuration interaction ( ncci ) calculations  @xcite , the nuclear many - body problem is formulated as a matrix eigenproblem .",
    "the hamiltonian is represented in terms of basis states which are antisymmetrized products of single - particle states for the full @xmath2-body system of nucleons , _",
    "i.e. _ , with no assumption of an inert core .",
    "in practice , the nuclear many - body calculation must be carried out in a truncated space .",
    "the dimension of the problem grows combinatorially with the size of the included single - particle space and with the number of nucleons in the system .",
    "computational restrictions therefore limit the extent to which converged results can be obtained , for energies or for other properties of the wave functions . except for the very lightest systems ( @xmath3 )",
    ", convergence is generally beyond reach . based on the still - unconverged calculations which are computationally feasible",
    ", we seek to obtain a reliable estimate of the true values of observables which would be obtained in the full , untruncated space .",
    "improved accuracy may be pursued both through the development of bases which yield accelerated convergence , as considered here , and by developing means by which robust extrapolations can be made  @xcite .",
    "a prominent feature in light nuclei is the emergence of halo structure  @xcite , in which one or more loosely - bound nucleons surround a compact core , spending much of their time in the classically - forbidden region .",
    "a realistic treatment of the long - range properties of the wave function has been found to be essential for an accurate reproduction of the halo structure  @xcite .    however , ncci calculations have so far been based almost exclusively upon bases constructed from harmonic oscillator single - particle wave functions .",
    "the harmonic oscillator radial functions have the significant limitation that they display gaussian asymptotic behavior , _",
    "i.e. _ , falling as @xmath4 for large @xmath5 .",
    "the actual asymptotics for nucleons bound by a finite - range force are instead expected to be exponential , _",
    "i.e. _ , falling as @xmath6 .",
    "observables which are sensitive to the large - distance asymptotic portions of the nuclear wave function present a special challenge to convergence in ncci calculations with a conventional oscillator basis .",
    "such `` long - range '' observables include the root - mean - square ( rms ) radius   an essential observable for halo nuclei   and @xmath7 moments and transitions .",
    "the @xmath8 dependence of the relevant operators in both cases preferentially weights the larger-@xmath5 portions of the wave function .",
    "the results for these observables in ncci calculations are in general highly basis - dependent  @xcite .",
    "the difficulties encountered in using an oscillator basis to describe a system with exponential asymptotics may be illustrated through the simple one - dimensional example of the schrdinger equation with a woods - saxon potential . in fig .",
    "[ fig - ws - soln ] , we see the results of solving for a particular eigenfunction in terms of successively larger bases of oscillator radial functions . in the classically forbidden region , where the potential is nearly flat , the tail of the wave function should be exponential .",
    "it should thus appear as a straight line on the logarithmic scale in fig .",
    "[ fig - ws - soln ] .",
    "inclusion of each additional basis function yields a small extension to the region in which the expected straight - line behavior is reproduced .",
    "however , for any finite number of oscillator functions , there is a radius beyond which the calculated tail is seen to sharply fall below the true asymptotics .",
    "we are therefore motivated to consider alternative bases which might be better suited for expanding the nuclear wave function in its asymptotic region .",
    "the coulomb - sturmian functions  @xcite , which are obtained as solutions of the sturm - liouville problem associated with the coulomb potential , constitute a complete set of square - integrable functions with exponential asymptotics .",
    "these functions have previously been applied to few - body problems in atomic  @xcite , hadronic  @xcite , and nuclear  @xcite physics .",
    "the framework for carrying out ncci calculations with general radial basis functions   and with the coulomb - sturmian functions , in particular   has been developed in ref .",

    "motivated by the disparity between proton and neutron radial distributions in the neutron - rich halo nuclei , we explore the use of proton - neutron asymmetric bases , with different length scales for the proton and neutron radial basis functions .",
    "we also examine the possibility of extracting rms radii for the proton and matter distributions based on a relatively straightforward estimate , the `` crossover point ''  @xcite , pending further development of more sophisticated extrapolation schemes  @xcite . the bases and methods",

    "the many - body basis is defined by taking antisymmetrized products of these single - particle states .",
    "the structure of the many - body calculation is independent of the details of the radial basis .",
    "the choice of radial basis enters the many - body calculation only through the values of the hamiltonian two - body matrix elements ( or higher - body matrix elements , if higher - body interactions are present ) , which we must first generate as the input to the many - body calculation .",
    "the choice of radial basis subsequently also enters into the extraction of observables ( electromagnetic moments and transitions , radii , _ etc . _ ) , from the densities obtained in the many - body calculation  @xcite . here",
    "the relevant inputs are the one - body or two - body matrix elements of the observable operators with respect to the given basis .",
    "the nuclear hamiltonian for ncci calculations has the form @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the galilean - invariant , two - body relative kinetic energy operator , and @xmath27 is the nucleon - nucleon interaction . a lawson term  @xcite proportional to the number @xmath28 of center - of - mass oscillator quanta",
    "may also be included , to shift center - of - mass excitations out of the low - lying spectrum .",
    "( the center - of - mass dynamics for ncci calculations with the coulomb - sturmian basis , including the effect of a lawson term , are investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) however , a lawson term is not essential for the present calculations , since we consider only the ground state , and the calculations of observables ( discussed below ) make use only of relative operators , which are , by construction , insensitive to the center - of - mass degrees of freedom .",
    "the relative kinetic energy decomposes into one - body and two - body terms as @xmath29 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime on the summation @xmath30 over nucleons indicates @xmath31 , @xmath2 is the nuclear mass number , and @xmath32 is the nucleon mass .",
    "the one - body term may be calculated simply in terms of one - dimensional radial integrals of the operator @xmath33 , with respect to the radial basis functions .",
    "since the two - body term is separable , matrix elements of this term may likewise be calculated in a straightforward fashion for any radial basis , in terms of radial integrals of the operators @xmath34 and angular momentum recoupling coefficients  @xcite .",
    "calculation of the two - body matrix elements for the interaction , however , is more involved if one moves to a general radial basis .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon interaction is defined in relative coordinates .",
    "the oscillator basis is special , in that matrix elements in a relative oscillator basis , consisting of functions @xmath35 , can readily be transformed to the two - body oscillator basis , consisting of functions @xmath36 , by the talmi - moshinsky transformation  @xcite .",
    "we therefore start from the two - body matrix elements @xmath37 generated with respect to the oscillator basis , and only then carry out a change of basis in the two - body space  @xcite .    specifically , the change of basis for interaction two - body matrix elements is accomplished by the transformation @xmath38 where we label single - particle orbitals for the oscillator basis by unbarred symbols @xmath39 and those for the coulomb - sturmian basis by barred symbols @xmath40 .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for detailed definitions and normalization conventions . )",
    "the coefficients @xmath41 are obtained from the one - dimensional overlaps of the harmonic oscillator and coulomb - sturmian radial functions , @xmath42 .",
    "it may be noted that the oscillator length @xmath43   with respect to which the original oscillator two - body matrix elements of the interaction are represented   will in general be different from the length scale @xmath44 of the coulomb - sturmian functions   defining the basis for the many - body calculation .",
    "the change - of - basis transformation in  ( [ eqn - tbme - xform ] ) is , in practice , limited to a finite sum , _",
    "e.g. _ , with a shell cutoff @xmath45 .",
    "the cutoff @xmath46 must be chosen high enough to ensure that the results of the subsequent many - body calculation are cutoff - independent , as verified by carrying out calculations with differing cutoffs .",
    "the accuracy obtained for a given cutoff may in general be expected to depend upon the oscillator and coulomb - sturmian length parameters defining the initial and final bases for the interaction , respectively , as well as upon the characteristics of the interaction ( _ e.g. _ , softness ) , nuclear eigenstates , and observables under consideration .",
    "the radius observables considered in the study of halo nuclei are the rms radii of the point - nucleon distributions : the proton distribution radius @xmath47 , the neutron distribution radius @xmath48 , and the combined matter distribution radius @xmath49 .",
    "the rms radius of the proton , neutron , and matter distributions are related as @xmath50 , and therefore only two out of three of these may be considered as independent observables . although @xmath48 is perhaps conceptually linked most naturally to neutron halo structure , @xmath47 and @xmath49 are most commonly quoted , in recognition of experimental considerations ( see sec .  [ sec - results - expt ] ) .",
    "the radii are all taken relative to the center of mass of the full set of nucleons , _",
    "i.e. _ , protons and neutrons in aggregate , and are obtained from the expectation values of the relative square - radius operators defined in  ( [ eqn - r - defn ] ) .",

    "specific relations needed for evaluating the two - body matrix elements of the proton and neutron relative square - radius operators with respect to an arbitrary basis may be found in the appendix .      any single - particle basis , including  ( [ eqn - ho - r ] ) or  ( [ eqn - cs - s ] ) , has , as a free parameter , an overall length scale , which we may denote by @xmath12 . for the oscillator basis , this is traditionally quoted as the oscillator energy @xmath53 , where @xmath54^{1/2}}.\\ ] ] in deference to the convention of presenting ncci results as a function of @xmath53 as the basis parameter",

    "this @xmath53 has no direct physical meaning as an energy scale for the coulomb - sturmian basis .",
    "however , the inverse square - root dependence remains , so that a factor of two change in @xmath53 still describes a factor of @xmath56 change in length scale ( illustrated for both harmonic oscillator and coulomb - sturmian bases by the dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig - scheme - radial ] ) .    beyond an overall length scale ,",
    "there is additional freedom in length scales which may be exploited in constructing the basis .",
    "the many - body basis states ( antisymmetrized product states ) constructed from a single - particle basis are orthonormal so long as the single - particle states are orthonormal .",
    "orthogonality for single - particle states of different @xmath18 or @xmath24 follows entirely from the angular and spin parts of the wave function . only orthogonality _ within _ the space of a given @xmath18 and @xmath24 follows from the radial functions , _",
    "e.g. _ , for the coulomb - sturmian functions , @xmath57\\,\\delta_{l'l}\\delta_{j'j}$ ] .",
    "we are therefore free to choose @xmath12 independently , firstly , for each @xmath18 space ( or @xmath24 space ) , as @xmath58 ( or @xmath59 ) , and , secondly , for protons and neutrons , as @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",

    "the second observation raises the possibility of proton - neutron asymmetric length scales , which might be advantageous for nuclei with significant disparities between the proton and neutron distributions , in particular , halo nuclei .",
