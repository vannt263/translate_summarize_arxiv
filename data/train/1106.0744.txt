    "their mcd normalizations are consistent with being the same within the error bars",
    ". the parameters of the hard component have large uncertainties , making it hard to constrain any trend . based on the mcd model , the above results provide one explanation of our large fast variability : it is caused by the fast variations in the mass accretion rate , with the disk truncated at a constant radius .",

    ", the source would be at about 0.3 and 1.0 eddington luminosity in xmm1 and xmm2 , respectively , common values seen in the thermal state of bh x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "we note that the light crossing time of the inner accretion disk around a bh with this mass is @xmath150 s , about the timescale on which the source begins to show strong variability ( figure  [ fig : lcfft ] ) .",
    "the above mass estimate is consistent with that using the bh mass vs. bulge luminosity relations ( section  [ sec : srcandobs ] ) , considering the large uncertainties of both methods .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the nature of the soft excess is still unclear .",
    "the above thermal disk model is one of the several competing models invoked ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the problem with this explanation is that the soft excesses from a sample of agn with a large range of mass and luminosity have characteristic temperatures spanning a narrow range ( @xmath10.10.2 kev ) , which is hard to explain @xcite .",
    "the narrow range of the characteristic temperatures of the soft excesses finds a natural explanation if they are due to atomic processes .",
    "there are two main scenarios , i.e. , absorption and reflection .",
    "@xcite proposed the soft excess as an artifact of strong , relativistically smeared , partially ionized absorption .",
    "we test this model using the swind1 model from xspec .",
    "we use the model swind1(pl ) , with @xmath127 required to be @xmath1673.5 to make sure that it is not the steep pl describing the soft excess .",
    "we obtain the values of @xmath178 to be 1.32(114 ) and 1.31(283 ) for xmm1 and xmm2 , respectively .",
    "both observations require strong velocities ( @xmath280.5 and 0.29@xmath250.02 speed of light for xmm1 and xmm2 , respectively ) to smear the absorption / emission lines , which is hard to achieve from a radiatively driven accretion disk wind @xcite .",
    "the difference between xmm1 and xmm2 is mainly due to different absorption column densities and smearing velocities , requiring dramatic changes in the absorber .    in the reflection model ,",
    "a series of soft x - ray emission lines below 2 kev , if strongly relativistically blurred , can produce the smooth soft excess feature .",
    "we follow @xcite to use the model kdblur(pl+reflionx ) , where kdblur is the relativistic convolution and reflionx is a table model of the ionized reflection ( see their references therein ) . in the fits we force xmm1 and xmm2 to have common values of @xmath134 , the inclination , and the fe abundance .",
    "we obtain @xmath178=0.95(111 ) and 1.34(281 ) and reflection flux fractions @xmath10.94 and 1 ( 0.210 kev , unabsorbed ) for xmm1 and xmm2 , respectively .",
    "the fits require a low inclination ( 17.1@xmath257.6@xmath140 ) , a high fe abundance ( @xmath179 solar value ) , and a steep illuminating power - law spectrum ( reaching the upper index limit of 3.3 allowed in the model ) .",
    "the disk emissivity index is different between these two observations ( @xmath180 and 8.99@xmath250.89 for xmm1 and xmm2 respectively ) , implying a very different disk structure .",
    "this model infers a highly spinning bh , with the inner disk radius at 2.38@xmath250.38 and @xmath181 gravitational radii for xmm1 and xmm2 respectively .",
    "compared with the results from @xcite , the above values are extreme but not unique .",
    "we see that both the absorption and reflection models invoke extreme environments to explain our source .",
    "the former requires absorbers at very high velocities and varying dramatically .",
    "the latter requires very steep illuminating spectra and very different disk emissivities between xmm1 and xmm2 . in comparison ,",
    "the thermal disk emission explanation for the soft component in our source is more reasonable . in this model ,",
    "the difference between xmm1 and xmm2 is simply due to the change in the accretion rate .",
    "we note that the inferred inner disk temperatures are lower than the typical characteristic temperatures of the soft excesses in agn , which might indicate that the soft component of our source has a different nature from soft excesses in agn .",
    "our spectral fits did not combine both the uv and x - ray spectra .",
    "there is about one order of magnitude difference ( about 9@xmath11 ) between the uv fluxes of the thermal disk inferred from the soft x - ray spectral fits and the om measurements ( section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "this can be due to several factors .",
    "first , we have only used the simple mcd model , while a more realistic disk spectral model is probably needed to fit broadband data ( about three decades in frequency here ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . secondly , the starlight or hot gas emission might be significant in the uv .",
    "this is supported by the little variability of the uv emission between xmm1 and the _ swift _ observation in 2011 february .",
    "finally , some uv emission might come from the reprocessing of the x - ray emission in the outer disk or surrounding gas .",
    "upper bounds .",
    "note that the _ rosat _ observation was made in 1992 october .",
    "the solid curve is @xmath182^{-5/3}$ ] erg s@xmath8 , and the dotted curve is @xmath183^{-5/3}$ ] erg s@xmath8 .",
    "[ fig : longtermlc ] ]    we show above that the x - ray emission in xmm1 and xmm2 can be best explained as coming from a thermal disk around a smbh with a mass of @xmath1@xmath176@xmath184 .",
    "the transient nature of the source makes it a great tidal disruption event candidate .",
    "this is further supported by the extreme softness of its x - ray spectra and the inactivity of the nucleus of the candidate host galaxy ic 4765-f01 - 1504 .",
    "the inactivity of ic 4765-f01 - 1504 , i.e. , not an agn , is indicated by its lack of significant optical emission lines ( figure  [ fig : optspec ] ) . as our new optical spectrum",
    "was made four years after the flare , this also implies no detection of optical emission lines due to the flare at this stage . the 2mass ir colors ( table  [ tbl : counterpart ] ) also put this galaxy in the region occupied by inactive galaxies in the color - color diagram ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the estimated bh mass allows the tidal disruption of a solar - type star to be observable @xcite .",
    "the luminosity reached 6.4@xmath1410@xmath141 erg  s@xmath8 , which is about the average seen in other candidates @xcite .",
    "however , no previous candidates had soft x - ray spectra with such high quality during the peak of the flare to allow for the detailed spectral studies here .",
    "one main feature of tidal disruption events is the temporal evolution .",
    "such events are predicted to rise on timescales of several months and decay on timescales of months / years @xcite .",
    "the decay approximately follows @xmath185 , where @xmath186 is the tidal disruption time , for most candidates @xcite , consistent with the theory .",
    "xmm1 is fainter than xmm2 , and they are separated by 211 days .",
    "if our source is due to tidal disruption , xmm1 should probably be in the rising phase , and xmm2 in the decay phase .",
    "we plot the luminosity curve in figure  [ fig : longtermlc ] .",
    "two decay curves following @xmath187 are also plotted , with xmm2 assumed to be in the decay .",
    "the dotted and solid curves assume @xmath186 to be at half a year and one month before xmm1 , respectively .",
    "these assumptions are reasonable , as the minimum period for the material to return to the smbh ( so as to accrete ) after disruption is on the order of a month @xcite .",
    "these curves predict that the source luminosity in the _ swift _ observation in 2011 february should be a factor of about 20 less than xmm2 .",
    "our detection limit is consistent with this . in the above",
    ", we concentrate only on the decay , as the connection from the rise to the decay is uncertain .",
    "the rise could probably take months , and there could be a short period of several months when the luminosity is maintained near the eddington limit @xcite .",
    "future sensitive x - ray observations in the decay are needed to constrain the long - term evolution .",
    "we see that our source showed large fast x - ray variability , with an rms of @xmath121% ( section  [ sec : pds ] ) in both observations .",
    "if they are really dominated by the thermal disk emission , the above rms value is high , compared with the values of @xmath55% typically seen in the thermal state of neutron - star ( ns ) or bh low - mass x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "we note that our rms was integrated over two decades in frequency , the same as the above studies . besides , in low - mass x - ray binaries , the power of the thermal disk typically scales with the frequency as @xmath188 @xcite , while the power for our source is steeper , scaling approximately as @xmath189 .",
    "large fast variability and steep power can be seen sometimes in the thermal state of x - ray binaries , such as the flaring branch of bright nss @xcite , which was ascribed to some local instability in the inner disk by @xcite . for the case of our source , we have shown in section  [ sec : pds ] that its fast variability can be explained as due to fast variations in the mass accretion rate , which , in the context of a tidal disruption event , could reasonably be ascribed to shocks during drastic compression and distortion of the stellar material @xcite .",
    "this does not occur in low - mass x - ray binaries , in which the mass is transferred through the roche lobe .",
    "thus we speculate that the large fast variability and the steep power in the thermal state is intrinsic to tidal disruption events . among the previous tidal disruption event candidates with thermal x - ray peaks ,",
    "the peak of was the best observed .",
    "it showed an increase of a factor of @xmath13 during the peak , but it was over four days @xcite , and the data quality was not high enough to investigate the variability on much shorter timescales .",
    "is unlikely to be an agn from the lack of bright optical emission lines . in the following",
    "we briefly compare the x - ray properties of our source with ultrasoft agn to show their similarities and differences .",
    "nls1 galaxies typically show the steepest soft - x - ray spectra among agn and have a typical photon index of around 3 @xcite .",
    "the simple fits of the xmm1 and xmm2 spectra using the pl model indicate an extreme softness of our source that is not seen in nls1s .",
    "we estimate the optical - to - x - ray spectral slope @xmath190 using the flux densities in the rest frame of 2500   and 2 kev @xcite . we obtain @xmath190=1.76@xmath250.03 . the luminosity density in the rest frame of 2500",
    "  is @xmath191=(1.48@xmath250.24)@xmath1410@xmath192 erg s@xmath8 hz@xmath8 . with this value of @xmath191",

    "we note , however , the possible large uncertainty of @xmath190 for our source , whose star light contamination might be large , as discussed above .",
    "there have been several ultrasoft agn claimed in the literature .",
    "the nls1 galaxy wpvs 007 has the softest x - ray spectrum among agn detected during the _ rosat _ all - sky survey , with @xmath127@xmath18 if fitted with a pl or @xmath194@xmath1@xmath195 ev with a bb @xcite .",
    "it can be explained as emission from the inner disk @xcite , but the quality of the data and the lack of simultaneous observations above 2.4 kev could make its soft excess due to the presence of a warm absorber @xcite .",
    "the narrow - line quasar phl 1092 has  observations , and the x - ray spectra are steep ( @xmath127@xmath145 ) , but the pl fit is not good when it is bright @xcite . its bright spectrum in 2003 was fitted with a model of mcd+pl plus an absorption line and a reflection component by @xcite ; its soft excess was ascribed to the mcd component ( @xmath194=114@xmath254 ev ) , as in our study . the nls1 galaxy 1h",
    "0707 - 495 also shows an intense soft excess .",
    "its x - ray spectra from  show @xmath127@xmath13.8 @xcite .",
    "they were fitted with a model of bb+pl plus a reflection component by @xcite . from this model , both the thermal disk emission and the reflection contribute to the soft excess , but the latter dominates .",
    "we note that the above ultrasoft agn show large short - term variability factors of a few and/or long - term variability factors of a few hundred , similar to our source .",
    "thus the variability of our source is not extreme compared with nls1s , but the softness of its x - ray spectra is hardly challenged .",
    "we note that the soft component in our source cools in low states , which is not generally seen in nls1s ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we explore the possibility that is not associated with the smbh in ic 4765-f01 - 1504 .",
    "if it is an ultraluminous x - ray source ( ulx ) in this galaxy , it would have a luminosity about one order of magnitude brighter than the brightest ulx reported thus far , i.e. , hlx-1 @xcite .",
    "however , as derived above , both the spectral fits and the variability argument imply that this source most probably has a mass of @xmath110@xmath310@xmath4 , and it should be within 0.5 kpc ( 3-@xmath11 error ) of the galaxy center .",
    "being so massive and so close to the galaxy center , it seems unlikely to be a source other than the central smbh .",
    "thus we deem that our source is not a ulx in ic 4765-f01 - 1504 .",
    "the other possibility is that is a foreground galactic source .",
    "following @xcite and using the 0.210 kev absorbed flux of 1.92@xmath1410@xmath196 erg s@xmath8 @xmath16 ( table  [ tbl : mcd+pl ] ) , we have the x - ray to ir flux ratio @xmath197 for our source , making it unlikely to be a coronally active star .",
