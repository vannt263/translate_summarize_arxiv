    "their approach was based on ideas from rapid adiabatic passage in two - state quantum systems @xcite .    in this paper , this method is further extended to realize a potentially highly efficient broadband sfg and dfg with a single crystal .",
    "this is achieved by treating the two simultaneous collinear second - order parametric processes @xmath5 and @xmath6 in analogy to coherent population transfer in three - state `` vee '' quantum systems .",
    "the analogy to level crossings in atomic systems @xcite ensues from the linearly chirped qpm gratings @xcite that we use to this end .",

    "therefore the three eigenvalues of @xmath25 cross at two different distances @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , thereby creating a crossing pattern in analogy with two parallel energies crossed by a third , tilted energy in quantum physics @xcite .",
