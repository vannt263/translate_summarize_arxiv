    "while the spectral properties of a singlet @xmath1-wave superconductor are largely unaffected by weak non - magnetic impurities  @xcite , the pair - breaking effect of magnetic impurities leads to the gradual destruction of superconductivity .",
    "remarkably , the suppression of the quasi - particle energy gap is more rapid than that of the superconducting order parameter , admitting the existence of a narrow ` gapless ' superconducting phase  @xcite in which the quasi - particle energy gap is destroyed while the superconducting order parameter remains non - zero .",
    "now , according to the conventional ( mean - field ) description formulated in the seminal work of abrikosov and gorkov ( ag ) , an energy gap is maintained up to a critical concentration of magnetic impurities ( at @xmath2 , @xmath3% of the critical concentration at which superconductivity is destroyed ) . yet , being unprotected by the anderson theorem , it seems likely that the gap structure predicted by the mean - field theory is untenable and must be destroyed by ` optimal ' fluctuations of the random impurity potential .",
    "indeed , since the pioneering work of ag , several authors  @xcite have explored the nature of ` sub - gap ' states in the superconducting system .",
    "the aim of this work is to present a detailed investigation of the spectrum and profile of sub - gap states in superconductors subject to a weak magnetic and non - magnetic impurity potential , thus systematically improving upon the mean - field theory of ag .",
    "our preliminary findings have already been reported in a recent letter  @xcite .    in the earliest works on the subject",
    "@xcite , attention was focussed on the the influence of strong magnetic impurities . in particular , in the unitarity limit , it was shown that a single magnetic impurity leads to the local suppression of the order parameter and creates a bound sub - gap quasi - particle state  @xcite . for a finite impurity concentration , these intra - gap states broaden into a band  @xcite merging smoothly with the continuum bulk states .",
    "by contrast , starting with a _ weak _ magnetic impurity distribution ( i.e. one in which the magnetic scattering can be treated within the born approximation ) , the mean - field theory of ag  @xcite predicts a gradual suppression of the quasi - particle energy gap . defining the dimensionless parameter @xmath4 where @xmath5 represents the value of the homogeneous self - consistent order parameter , and @xmath6 denotes the born scattering time due to magnetic impurities , the ag theory shows the gap to follow the relation @xmath7 showing an onset of the gapless region at @xmath8 ( note @xmath9 throughout ) . within the same mean - field theory , for @xmath10 ,",
    "the self - consistent order parameter varies as @xmath11 $ ] where @xmath12 represents the order parameter of the clean superconductor , confirming that the order parameter is finite at the onset of the gapless phase .",
    "the precise variation of the quasi - particle energy gap is compared to that of the self - consistent order parameter in fig .",
    "[ fig : gap_delta ] . staying within the framework of the mean - field theory ,",
    "one can obtain a smooth interpolation between the strong and weak impurity scattering behaviors  @xcite .",
    "however , even for weak disorder , it is apparent that optimal fluctuations of the random potential must generate sub - gap states in the interval @xmath13 , and therefore provide non - perturbative corrections to the self - consistent born approximation used by ag . extending the arguments of balatsky and trugman  @xcite , a fluctuation of the random potential which leads to an effective born scattering rate @xmath14 in excess of @xmath15 over a range set by the superconducting coherence length",
    ", @xmath16 induces quasi - particle states down to energies @xmath17 .",
    "these sub - gap states are localized , being bound to the region or ` droplet ' where the scattering rate is large .",
    "the situation bears comparison with band tail states in semi - conductors . here",
    "rare or optimal configurations of the random impurity potential generate bound states , known as lifshitz tail states  @xcite , which extend below the band edge .",
    "however , the correspondence is , to some extent , superficial : band tail states in semi - conductors are typically associated with smoothly varying , nodeless wavefunctions . by contrast , the tail states below the superconducting gap involve the superposition of states around the fermi level . as such , one expects these states to be rapidly oscillating on the scale of the fermi wavelength @xmath18 , but modulated by an envelope which is localized on the scale of the coherence length @xmath19 .",
    "this difference is not incidental .",
    "firstly , unlike the semi - conductor , one expects the energy dependence of the density of states in the tail region below the mean - field gap edge to be ` universal ' , independent of the nature of the weak impurity distribution , but dependent only on the pair - breaking parameter @xmath20 . secondly , as we will see , one can not expect a straightforward extension of existing theories  @xcite of the lifshitz tails to describe the profile of tail states in the superconductor .    in the bcs approximation ,",
    "the random system we consider is specified by the gorkov hamiltonian @xmath21 where the matrix components index the particle / hole content , and @xmath22 denotes the normal component of the random hamiltonian .",
    "here we take @xmath23 to be spatially homogeneous and determined self - consistently from the conventional ag mean - field theory .",
    "we will assess the validity of this assumption below .",
    "in addition to the weak potential impurity distribution @xmath24 , the particles experience a quenched random magnetic impurity distribution @xmath25 where @xmath26 represents the exchange coupling and pauli matrices @xmath27 operate on the spin indices .",
    "the magnetic @xmath28 and non - magnetic @xmath24 random impurity potentials are both taken to be gaussian @xmath29-correlated with zero mean and variance @xmath30 respectively , and @xmath31 represents the average density of states ( dos ) per spin of the normal system .    to keep our discussion simple , and to make contact with the ag theory , we will take the quenched distribution of magnetic impurities to be ` classical ' and non - interacting throughout . for practical purposes ,",
    "this entails the consideration of structures where both the kondo temperature  @xcite and , more significantly , the rkky induced spin glass temperature  @xcite are smaller than the relevant energy scales of the superconductor .",
    "the remaining energy scales are arranged in the quasi - classical and dirty limits : @xmath32 where @xmath33 represents the transport time associated with non - magnetic impurities .",
    "we remark that these limits are not compatible with the situation in which the magnetic impurities provide the only source of scattering , i.e. @xmath34 .",
    "we should not , therefore , expect a straightforward comparison with the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite .    within the approximations above",
    "we will derive a quasi - classical field theory of the disordered superconducting system .",
    "following the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite we will express spectral properties of the system in terms of an intermediate energy scale action which accommodates the quantum interference properties of the superconducting system . by investigating stationary inhomogeneous instanton field configurations of the action , we will expose the structure and profile of the sub - gap states , and thereby obtain an analytical expression for the dos to exponential accuracy .",
    "finally , we will comment on the universality of the present scheme by applying the same technique to investigate ` gap fluctuations ' in a quantum dot coupled by open channels to a superconducting terminal .",
    "although the analysis is straightforward , the technology is somewhat involved .",
    "we have therefore decided to summarize the main conclusions of this investigation here in the introduction .",
    "in particular , we will show that , in the vicinity of the mean - field gap edge , the sub - gap dos of the @xmath0-dimensional system is dominated by tail states which are confined to droplets of size @xmath35 the corresponding sub - gap dos takes the form @xmath36\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 denotes the bare dimensionless conductance and @xmath38 represents a dimensionless function of the control parameter @xmath20 ( @xmath39 const . ) . when reparameterized in terms of the dos just above the mean - field gap edge  @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 the expression for the sub - gap dos",
    "can be brought to the more compact form @xmath42\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath43 some numerical constant .",
    "in the zero - dimensional system , although the interpretation of the optimal fluctuation as a localized droplet is no longer appropriate , the expression above correctly interpolates to @xmath44 and coincides with the universal expression for gap fluctuations proposed in ref .",
    "the surprising dependence of the result on the dimensionless distance from the mean - field gap is one of the reasons why a lifshitz argument appears difficult to construct for this problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : ft ] a theory of the statistical properties of the gorkov green function is developed within the framework of a supersymmetric field theory involving a non - linear @xmath45-model functional .",
    "here we follow closely the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ( c.f . ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as a result",
    "we identify the conventional ag mean - field equation with the homogeneous saddle - point equation of the effective action .",
    "in section  [ sec : inhomo ] we show that the non - vanishing of the dos beneath the gap predicted by the standard ag theory is due to the appearance of inhomogeneous `` instanton '' saddle points of finite action .",
    "we identify the profile of these instantons with the envelope modulating the quasi - classical sub - gap states .",
    "the instanton configurations considered break the underlying supersymmetry of the action , and a detailed examination of fluctuations is required to understand how supersymmetry is restored by zero modes , as well as to appreciate fully how these configurations are able to contribute to the dos . in section  [ sec : zerod ] we examine the zero dimensional limit of the problem and compare our results to the recent literature  @xcite . in doing so , we provide an explanation of the universal results reported in ref .",

    "[ sec : discuss ] we speculate on potential generalizations of the results presented here .",

    "this completes the analysis of the saddle - point solution together with the corresponding action .",

    "the resolution of both problems lies in the nature of the fluctuations around the symmetry broken mean - field solution .",
    "these field fluctuations can be separated into `` radial '' and `` angular '' contributions .",
    "the former involve fluctuations of the diagonal elements @xmath141 , while the latter describe rotations including those grassmann transformations which mix the bf sector  @xcite .",
    "both classes of fluctuations play a crucial role .      before turning to the technical analysis ,",
    "let us outline qualitatively the influence of the fluctuations around the mean - field . as usual , associated with radial fluctuations around the bounce , there exists a zero mode ( due to translational invariance of the solution ) , and a negative energy mode .",
    "the latter , which necessitates a @xmath160 rotation of the corresponding integration contour to follow the line of steepest descent ( c.f .",
    "@xcite and see below ) , has two effects : firstly it ensures that the non - perturbative contributions to the local dos are non - vanishing , and secondly , that they are positive .",
    "turning to the angular fluctuations , the breaking of supersymmetry is accompanied by the appearance of a grassmann zero mode separated by a gap from higher excitations which restores the global supersymmetry ( c.f .",

    "this in why the usual ag dos is just given by evaluating the source ( [ eq : dos_source ] ) at the supersymmetric ag saddle point .",
    "since @xmath190 and @xmath191 are both positive definite , integration over the fermion - fermion degrees of freedom merely generates some ( weakly energy dependent ) positive prefactor .",
    "the boson - boson sector is more interesting .",
    "in particular , it is straightforward to verify that the action for the components @xmath192 simply reflects the longitudinal variation @xmath193 with @xmath194 .",
    "thus the action for @xmath192 is the one that could have been written down from the outset : it is that of the fluctuations of @xmath125 around the bounce instanton discussed in section  [ sec : inst ] . to address the influence of this class of fluctuations we can draw on the standard literature  @xcite .    to perform the gaussian integration over the fields @xmath192",
    ", we form the expansion @xmath195 in terms of the eigenfunctions @xmath196 of the quadratic operator in the action for @xmath192 . now",
    "the action for @xmath192 exhibits a zero mode @xmath197 due to translational invariance of the action ( the bounce can be positioned anywhere in space ) .",
    "this zero mode must be accommodated by the introduction of a collective coordinate which in turn introduces a jacobian factor associated with the change of variables from @xmath198 to the collective coordinate .",
    "furthermore , since the instanton is a bounce , the zero mode @xmath199 has a node , and hence there exists a ground state of @xmath200 with negative energy .",
    "this requires the contour for the integration variable @xmath201 to be deformed away from the real axis  it takes a right turn at zero and heads in the negative imaginary direction . in the context of the contour drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : bounce_contour ] , this is because we have to get back to the real axis for @xmath125 .",
    "this deformation of the integration contour has a profound consequence .",
    "while the contribution to the sub - gap states from the bounce solution alone vanishes ( recall that the instanton was confined to the line @xmath137 , so that @xmath202 remains imaginary ) , the rotation of the integration contour introduces a factor of @xmath203 resulting in an imaginary contribution to the green function below the gap .",
    "this is turn would signify a non - zero sub - gap dos .",
    "the mechanism operates in the related context of landau levels broadened by disorder and discussed by efetov and marikhin  @xcite ( see also an earlier paper by affleck  @xcite ) .",
    "it is reassuring to note that the deformation of the integration contour , which is constrained to return to the undeformed bosonic contour , is unambiguous , and gives rise to only positive definite contributions to the dos . finally , as usual , since the contour only runs over half a gaussian for @xmath204 , its contribution yields a factor of @xmath205 .",
    "this completes the discussion of the contribution to the functional integral from the bosonic degrees of freedom .",
    "finally we turn to the role of the grassmann fluctuations . considering the supersymmetric structure of the action ,",
    "it is immediately clear that supersymmetry breaking must be accompanied by the existence of zero mode in the grassmann sector which restores the supersymmetry .",
    "indeed , an inspection of the potential @xmath206 identifies a zero energy eigenfunction gapped from the others ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : goldstino ] )  @xcite .",
    "this situation may be compared with the analysis of andreev and altshuler  @xcite , who identified a stationary phase saddle - point that determines the oscillatory part of energy level correlation functions for normal diffusive conductors .",
    "again this saddle - point is more correctly a manifold of points related by supersymmetry , but the fact that it is spatially uniform guarantees that the spectrum of grassmann fluctuations is truly gapless .",
    "this zero mode indicates the existence of a degenerate manifold parameterized by a grassmann coordinate .",
    "the integration of unity over this grassmann coordinate yields zero , which ensures the necessary normalization condition @xmath207\\rangle_{v , s}=1 $ ] is met .",
    "a non - zero result can be obtained only if there is a prefactor ( or source term ) that breaks supersymmetry . making use of the dos source ( [ eq : dos_source ] ) ,",
    "we expand in @xmath208 to find the lowest order part quadratic in the grassmanns ( at order @xmath209 ) @xmath210 from this result , we see that the local sub - gap dos remains non - zero only in the vicinity of the instanton where the supersymmetry is broken .",
    "thus , taking into account gaussian fluctuations and zero modes , one obtains the non - perturbative , one instanton contribution to the sub - gap dos : @xmath211\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the factor @xmath212 represents the jacobian associated with the introduction of the collective coordinate  @xcite , @xmath213 is the overall factor arising from the non - zero modes , and the grassmann zero mode wavefunction @xmath214 is normalized such that @xmath215 here we have assumed that the @xmath216 integration only contributes to the positive prefactor . we have checked this numerically for a few cases and expect a general statement could be made by moving to a different parameterization .",
    "( [ eq : dosresult ] ) is the main result of this section .",
    "note the non - perturbative nature of the result , both in the coupling constant @xmath217 of the @xmath45-model , and the ( dimensionless ) spin scattering rate @xmath20 .",
    "the calculation above was tailored to the consideration of the quasi one - dimensional geometry .",
    "the generalization to higher dimensions follows straightforwardly .",
    "in particular , it is necessary to seek inhomogeneous solutions of the saddle - point equation  ( [ eq : firstint ] ) where the gradient operator must be interpreted as the higher dimensional generalization .",
    "generally , this equation must be solved numerically . however , for energies @xmath84 in the vicinity of the gap @xmath107 , an analytic expression for the energy scaling can be obtained .    using the approximation to @xmath219 $ ]  ( [ eq : approxv ] ) valid when @xmath220 , the exponential dependence of the sub - gap dos can be deduced in higher dimension . in this limit",

    "leaving aside the practical relevance of this situation , theoretical motivation is provided by a recent paper  @xcite that explored this regime using a random matrix analysis .",
    "however , before turning to the consideration of the zero - dimensional limit of the present problem let us first try to draw some intuition from a closely related investigation of a different system comprised of a normal quantum dot contacted to a superconducting terminal ( as shown in fig .",

    "the sub - gap correction is found by identifying a second inhomogeneous instanton configuration that breaks supersymmetry at the level of the action  @xcite .",
    "both solutions merge at the mean - field gap .",
    "now , following the arguments above , it is simple to see how the phenomenology of ref .",
    "@xcite fits into the same general scheme : in this case the relevant coordinate of @xmath85 interpolates between the inhomogeneous mean - field solution and the instanton .",
    "the result is a sub - gap dos which assumes the familiar form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gentail2 ] ) , with appropriately defined geometry dependent parameters @xmath107 and @xmath301 .",
    "naturally the introduction of @xmath302 transverse dimensions gives the expected energy dependence of @xmath303 in the exponent .    in the opposite limit @xmath304 ( not considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , gradients of @xmath85 are heavily penalized and the coupling to the lead _ must _ be retained in its ` logarithmic form ' , with @xmath85 being taken as constant in the dot .",
    "( indeed , the logarithm is crucial to reproduce even the mean - field expression for the dos  ( [ eq : gendos ] ) with the correct coefficients . )",
    "this is the true zero - dimensional limit treated above .",
    "as we have seen , with this action , one recovers the known universal expression for the spectrum of gap fluctuations below the mean - field edge .",
    "to conclude , we have developed a quasi - classical field theory describing a superconductor in the dirty limit with weak magnetic impurity scattering .",
    "the abrikosov - gorkov mean - field treatment of this system , showing a diminished but hard gap in the dos , can be straightforwardly recovered as a homogeneous saddle - point of the effective action .",
    "where zero dos is predicted by the mean - field theory , there exist spatially inhomogeneous saddle - point configurations that break supersymmetry at the level of the action .",
    "a careful analysis of fluctuations around these instanton configurations demonstrate how supersymmetry is restored by a manifold of equivalent configurations parametrized by a grassmann coordinate , but more importantly how the configurations give rise to a finite , though exponentially small , dos .",
    "in contrast to band tail states in semi - conductors , the quasi - particle nature of the sub - gap states leads to universality of their properties .",
    "finally , let us remark on the connection of the results presented above to related problems in the literature .",
    "the resulting expression for the dos ( [ eq : genres ] ) was found to be non - perturbative in the @xmath45-model coupling @xmath305 , which measures the strength of non - magnetic disorder .",
    "we note that other non - perturbative results in disordered systems have been obtained by related instanton calculations . as well as the investigation of tail states in semi - conductors  @xcite , a supersymmetric field theory was developed by affleck  @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) to investigate tail states in the lowest landau level .",
    "there it was shown that tail states correspond to instanton configurations of the _ @xmath61-field action _",

    "it is also interesting to compare the present scheme with the study of ` anomalously localized states '  @xcite ( see also , ref .",
    "there one finds that long - time current relaxation in a disordered wire is also associated with instanton configurations of the @xmath45-model action .",
    "finally , a lifshitz argument has been applied on the level of the usadel equation in the study of gap fluctuations due to inhomogeneities of the bcs interaction  @xcite .",
    "although we have focussed largely on the question of tail states below the mean - field quasi - particle gap of a superconductor with magnetic impurities , we expect the instanton approach developed here to be more widely applicable .",
    "indeed , in this work we have shown the intimate connection between the study of sub - gap states in the magnetic impurity problem and gap fluctuations in hybrid superconductor / normal structures .",
    "furthermore , the same instanton approach describes gap fluctuations in superconductors with a quenched inhomogeneous distribution of the bcs coupling constant  @xcite , as well as quasi - two dimensional superconducting films subject to strong in - plane magnetic fields  @xcite . in both cases the latter",
    "are described by a mean - field theory which assumes the abrikosov - gorkov form .",
    "more speculatively , it seems likely that the same general scheme can be employed to study the influence of optimal fluctuations on the nature of bulk transitions .",
    "for example , in the present system , the transition to bulk superconductivity with reducing magnetic impurity concentration will be preempted by the nucleation of superconducting islands or droplets within the metallic / insulating phase ( c.f . ref .",
    "similarly , the stoner transition to a bulk itinerant ferromagnet in a disordered system will be mediated by the formation of a droplet phase in which islands become ferromagnetic  @xcite . in both cases , we expect these ` droplet phases ' to be associated with inhomogeneous instanton configurations of the corresponding low - energy action .",

    "this happens because @xmath91 becomes ineffective far from the instanton as @xmath311 becomes supersymmetric .",
    "this would reflect in the measure associated with the fluctuations parameterized by @xmath91 , and amounts to a `` stiffness '' . because the rational parameterization has trivial measure , this effect is visible at the level of the action .",
