    "the launch of space photometric missions , such as corot , most , or _ kepler _ , has revolutionized many branches of stellar astrophysics . extremely precise and nearly continuous photometric observations led to many discoveries and improvements in studies of various kinds of variable stars .",
    "one of the fields that benefited the most are detached eclipsing binaries ( debs ) .",
    "these are one of the most important objects for the astrophysics , as they allow to directly determine a number of fundamental stellar parameters , that are difficult or sometimes impossible to obtain otherwise .",
    "the unprecedented photometric quality of _ kepler _ data has opened new possibilities in studies of debs , as it allows for better than before precision in derivation of light - curve - based parameters , like fractional radii or orbital inclination , and observations of various other phenomena , for example : differential rotation , activity cycles , pulsations , including tidally induced , solar - like oscillations , etc .",
    "the _ kepler _ mission has revealed a zoo of objects , showing variety of characteristics .",
    "the photometry alone , however , is not enough to accurately characterize a given deb .",
    "one has to combine it with information obtained from spectra , optimally taken with high resolution .",
    "this information includes for example : precise radial velocities ( rvs ) , monitored in time in order to observe their variability , or atmospheric parameters obtained from spectral analysis .",
    "only such a complete set of data is useful for the purposes of modern stellar astrophysics .",
    "studies of debs are important not only because of the information one can obtain for a particular object .",
    "characterisation of a large number of targets is beneficial for statistical studies , from which one can draw conclusions about , e.g. , the amount of binaries and higher - order multiples , or mechanisms of their formation and evolution .    for this reason , we have started a spectroscopic monitoring of the brightest _ kepler _ debs with the 1.88-m telescope of the okayama astrophysical observatory . for the purpose of precise characterization of stellar components , one should target those debs that are also double - lined spectroscopic binaries ( sb2s ) .",
    "however , it is also possible derive many important information from single - lined ( sb1 ) objects . in this study",
    "we present a sample of such systems , showing the variety they represent  from primary components of exotic binaries , to multiples of different orders .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section [ sec_targets ]",
    "we briefly present the target selection criteria for our whole program , and basic information about the systems presented here .",
    "section [ sec_data ] presents the data used for this study .",
    "section [ sec_analysis ] presents all the methods used for this work , including spectra reduction , derivation of rvs and eclipse timing measurements , modelling rv and light curves , and comparison with isochrones .",
    "the results , are presented in section [ sec_results ] , and the last section contains a short summary .",

    "<S> we present results of our spectroscopic observations of nine detached eclipsing binaries ( debs ) , selected from the _ kepler _ eclipsing binary catalog , that only show one set of spectral lines . </S>",
    "<S> radial velocities ( rvs ) were calculated from the high resolution spectra obtained with the hides instrument , attached to the 1.88-m telescope at the okayama astrophysical observatory , and from the public apogee archive .    </S>",
    "<S> in our sample we found five single - lined binaries , with one component dominating the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the orbital and light curve solutions were found for four of them , and compared with isochrones , in order to estimate absolute physical parameters and evolutionary status of the components . </S>",
    "<S> for the fifth case we only update the orbital parameters , and estimate the properties of the unseen star . </S>",
    "<S> two other systems show orbital motion with a period known from the eclipse timing variations ( etvs ) . for these we obtained parameters of outer orbits , by translating the etvs to rvs of the centre of mass of the eclipsing binary , and combining with the rvs of the outer star . </S>",
    "<S> of the two remaining ones , one is most likely a blend of a faint background deb with a bright foreground star , which lines we see in the spectra , and the last case is possibly a quadruple bearing a sub - stellar mass object .    where possible , we compare our results with literature , especially with results from asteroseismology . </S>",
    "<S> we also report possible detections of solar - like oscillations in our rvs .    </S>",
