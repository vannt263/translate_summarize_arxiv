    "truncations in the stellar population at the edges of disk galaxies are thought to be a common morphological feature ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ?",
    "van der kruit ( 1979 ) and van der kruit & searle ( 1981a , 1981b ) , using photographic images of mostly late - type , edge - on spirals , found that the exponential decline in surface brightness in the inner disks seemed to change quite abruptly to a steeper decline at the edges of the galaxies . in principle , the faint surface brightness of the outer disk region ( face - on @xmath0 ) makes truncations easier to detect in edge - on disks , where line - of - sight integration increases the observed surface brightness .",
    "however , their very edge - on nature makes it difficult to determine if detected truncations are truly _ radial _ in nature , as opposed to azimuthal variations due to , e.g. , strong spiral arms .",
    "the difficulty of clearly identifying disk features ( spirals , bars , rings , etc . ) in edge - on galaxies also makes it hard to see whether truncations might be related to specific morphological and dynamical features in the disk .",
    "@xcite , using very deep exposures of three face - on sbc  sc galaxies , showed that truncations can be clearly identified in face - on disks , and that the decline in surface brightness outside the truncation break is best described by an exponential , steeper by about a factor of two than that for the inner disk .",
    "figure  [ fig : one ] shows an example of such a `` classical '' truncation . despite the apparent prevalence of truncations at 35 scale lengths in edge - on galaxies ( principally late - type spirals ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there _ are _ face - on or moderately inclined galaxies where the disk s surface brightness profile can be traced as a single exponential to larger radii without truncation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; figure  [ fig : one ] shows an example .",
    "in this letter we draw attention to a significant subset ( at least @xmath1% ) of barred s0sb galaxies which exhibit a kind of `` anti - truncation '' : the surface brightness profile becomes _ shallower _ at large radii , so that there is an excess of light above the outward projection of the ( inner ) exponential profile .",
    "while some of these profiles can be explained as light from a round outer envelope or halo ( perhaps the outer extent of the bulge ) dominating at larger radii , the majority can not .",
    "instead , they appear to be continuations of the disk with shallower but still exponential profiles . some of these galaxies show strong asymmetries ( e.g. , lopsided or one - armed spirals ) in the outer disk , and so may represent the result of recent interactions .",
    "the overall sample on which this study is based is described in more detail in @xcite and erwin et al.(2005 ) .",
    "briefly , it consists of all northern ( @xmath2 ) , barred s0sb galaxies from the uppsala galaxy catalog @xcite with @xmath3 , axis ratio @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , and heliocentric @xmath6 ( measurements and classifications from * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter rc3 ) . because there is evidence for inconsistency in hubble types when",
    "spirals in the virgo cluster are compared with field spirals ( e.g. , virgo sa galaxies tend to resemble field sc galaxies ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we excluded virgo cluster galaxies .",
    "( we did , however , include s0 galaxies from the virgo cluster , since there is no evidence for inconsistent classification of these galaxies . ) after eliminating a few galaxies without bars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we had a total of 65 galaxies .",
    "the sample is complete within its selection criteria , but the diameter limit produces a bias in favor of luminous and high - surface - brightness galaxies .",
    "it is obviously biased against _",
    "unbarred _ galaxies ; but since we included both strong and weakly barred galaxies ( sb and sab classifications from rc3 ) , the result is representative of the majority of local , early - type disk galaxies .",
    "we obtained azimuthally averaged , @xmath7-band surface brightness profiles of all the objects .",
    "details of the observations , calibrations , and reduction procedures are given in erwin et al.(2005 ) .",
    "particular attention was paid to ensuring flat and accurately subtracted sky backgrounds , with the halos of bright stars and neighboring galaxies carefully masked out .",
    "the orientation of the outer disk ( position angle and projected ellpiticity ) was derived from free - ellipse fits to the images , or from kinematic studies in the literature ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the final profiles are from logarithmically spaced , concentric ellipses with constant position angle and ellipticity , matching that of the outer disk .",
    "figure  [ fig : one ] shows surface brightness profiles for two moderately inclined galaxies which exhibit `` conventional '' behavior : ngc  2273 shows a classical truncation at 3.3 scale lengths of the inner ( @xmath8 ) disk , while ngc  4596 shows a single exponential profile which extends to at least @xmath9 scale lengths with no hint of a truncation .",
    "the majority of galaxies in our sample have similar profiles , with untruncated profiles being far more common ( see erwin et al .",
    "2005 for the complete set of profiles ) .",
    "at least 25% of the galaxies have profiles with qualitatively different behavior : there is an excess of light at large radii , above the projected exponential disk profile .",
    "the transition happens at surface brightness levels @xmath1025.6 mag arcsec@xmath11 ( mean = @xmath12 ; for comparison , the truncations in pohlen et al .",
    "2002 are at a mean @xmath13 )",
    ". figure  [ fig : big ] presents profiles for 12 of the 16 galaxies which unambiguously show this behavior ( there are other galaxies which may have excess light at large radii , but s / n and sky - subtraction uncertainties make it more difficult to be certain ) . because this is the opposite of a classical truncation",
    " and happens at similar radii ( 3.26.0 inner scale lengths )  we dub them `` anti - truncations '' ; by extending freeman s ( 1970 ) classification scheme we can also refer to them as `` type iii '' profiles .    because these are early - type galaxies ( many of them s0 ) , an obvious interpretation would be that the excess light at large radii is not from the _ disk _ , but rather from the luminous bulge or halo .",
    "this appears to be true for about one - third of the galaxies with anti - truncations ( left - hand column of figure  [ fig : big ] )  all of them s0  which have two characteristics in common .",
    "first , the inflection in the profiles is smooth and curved , which suggests that the outer light is from a separate component , added to the inner light from the disk .",
    "second , the isophotes are elliptical in the inner region and become progressively _ rounder _ at larger radii ( figure  [ fig : ell]a ) ; this is clear evidence for an inclined disk embedded in a more spheroidal outer component .",
    "but the majority of the galaxies ( center and right - hand columns of figure  [ fig : big ] ) have outer isophotes which are _ not _ significantly rounder than the inner isophotes ( figure  [ fig : ell]b ) .",
    "morphologically at least , the excess outer light is still part of the disk . in several of the sab and sb galaxies ( e.g. , ngc  4319 , 4699 , 5740 , 5806 ) , symmetric or asymmetric spiral arms are clearly visible in the region outside the transition , which again argues for the excess outer light being part of the disk .",
    "finally , in most of these profiles the transition is quite sharp , so we are probably not seeing the addition of light from two overlapping components , but rather a single disk with a fairly abrupt change in its density profile .",
    "the outer part of the profile is usually quite exponential ; we show exponential fits to the outer profiles in figure  [ fig : big ] .",
    "could we be seeing thick disks , which are exponential but with larger scale lengths than the brighter thin disks ?",
    "the combined profile of a thin disk and a thick disk should be the sum of two exponentials ; observations of edge - on galaxies show that scale length ratios ( thick to thin ) are almost always less than 2.0 @xcite .",
    "for some of our galaxies , particularly those with smooth transitions between the inner and outer regions , the profile is indeed well fit by a double - exponential ( e.g. , ngc  3489 , 3941 , and 4143 ) .",
    "however , the resulting scale length ratios ( outer to inner , or `` thick '' to `` thin '' ) range from 2.1 to 6.3 , with a mean of 3.8 , which is clearly outside the range of known thin / thick - disk systems .",
    "furthermore , for the galaxies with the sharpest transitions ( e.g. , ngc  3982 , 4371 , 4691 , and 5740 ) , the best - fitting double - exponential produces a distinct excess above the observed profile in the transition region .",
    "we conclude that the outer excesses we see are probably _ not _ thick disks .    so what s going on ?",
    "one clue may be the presence of lopsided / asymmetric spiral arms in the outer regions of some of the `` disky '' galaxies .",
    "ngc  4319 has a dramatic , one - armed outer spiral ( responsible for the excess light between 50 and 100 in the profile ; figure  [ fig : big ] ) which may be connected to a faint structure further out resembling a tidal tail .",
    "ngc  5740 and ngc  5806 have weaker , lopsided spiral distortions in their outer isophotes .",
    "so one possibility is that interactions are responsible in some fashion for the outer excess light in the disks .    in two galaxies ( ngc  4045 and ngc  4612 )",
    ", there are outer rings coincident with the transition between inner and outer slopes ; in three more ( ngc  4371 , ngc  4699 , and ngc  5806 ) , the transition happens at @xmath142.5 times the bar radius , which is the typical size of outer rings ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that the transition might be happening at or near the bar s outer lindblad resonance .",
    "we note that in some galaxies ( e.g. , ngc  4612 and ngc  4699 ) , the transition to the outer profile happens at a relatively small radius and high surface brightness level ; since the outer disk is easily detected in these galaxies , it might be tempting to classify the inner exponential slope as the galaxy s `` bulge '' ( the @xmath15 region of ngc  4699 is in fact referred to this way in * ? ? ?",
    "but these inner regions are where the bars ( and , in ngc  4699 , numerous spiral arms and dust lanes ) are found and are thus _ not _ classical ( kinematically hot ) bulges ; smaller central excesses ( e.g. , @xmath16 for ngc  4699 ) may be better candidates for the bulge proper .",
    "the inner disk regions of these two galaxies , at least , can thus be viewed as `` pseudobulges '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , albeit much larger than those pseudobulges thought to arise from bar - driven inflow , which are necessarily smaller than the bars .    these surface - brightness profiles with outer excesses , which we have termed anti - truncations or type  iii profiles , are found in @xmath1% of our sample ; this should be regarded as a lower limit , since not all of our images reach the same limiting surface brightness and we could be missing similar features at fainter surface - brightness levels .",
    "even if we exclude those galaxies whose isophote shapes indicate we are probably seeing luminous halos or outer bulges ( left - hand column of figure  [ fig : big ] ; 8% of the full sample , or 20% of the s0 galaxies ) , at least 17% of the galaxies appear to have disks with anti - truncation behavior .",
    "disks with anti - truncations thus appear to be _ more _ common than disks with classical truncations ( @xmath17% of the sample ; see erwin et al.2005 ) , at least in barred , s0sb disk galaxies .",
    "we would like to thank the anonymous referee for a careful reading , and especially for suggesting we take a closer look at the issue of thick disks .",
