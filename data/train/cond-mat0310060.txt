    "the statistical mechanics of dilute and semi - dilute solutions of interacting polymers may be greatly simplified by adopting a coarse - graining strategy for this complex many - body system , whereby the initial monomer or segment - level description is reduced to a `` soft - colloid '' representation involving only the centers of mass ( c.m . ) of the polymer coils .",
    "this is formally achieved by tracing out the individual monomer degrees of freedom for fixed positions of the c.m.s of the polymers .",
    "this reduction procedure results in effective interactions between the c.m.s which are state dependent , since they are in fact _ free _ energies of the `` fluid '' of monomers , for each configuration of the c.m.s of the @xmath4 interacting coils . in the low concentration limit",
    ", this free energy reduces to a pairwise additive sum of effective potentials of mean force acting between the c.m.s of overlapping polymers , which depend only on temperature .",
    "such pair potentials were first considered by flory and krigbaum @xcite , and later put on a firmer basis by grosberg _",
    "@xcite , who showed that the effective pair potential between the c.m.s of linear self - avoiding walk ( saw ) polymers remains finite at full overlap in the scaling limit ( where the number of segments @xmath5 ) , and of the order of a few @xmath6 , reflecting the purely entropic origin of the effective interaction in the athermal saw model .",
    "quantitative estimates of the effective c.m .",
    "pair potential between two isolated saw polymers were obtained by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of on- and off - lattice models and by renormalization group calculations @xcite .",
    "these studies show that the zero concentration pair potential is purely repulsive and reasonably well represented by a gaussian of amplitude @xmath7 and width equal to the radius of gyration @xmath8 .",
    "the saw model describes polymers in good solvent .",
    "poor solvent conditions may be modeled by adding a finite attractive interaction between monomers and lowering the temperature .",
    "mc simulations @xcite show that the resulting effective c.m .",
    "pair potential becomes less repulsive as the temperature @xmath9 is lowered , and can become attractive in the vicinity of the @xmath1 temperature .    when the polymer concentration is increased , three- and more - body effective interactions between the polymer c.m.s come into play .",
    "these can also in principle be calculated by mc simulations of clusters of three or more polymers @xcite , but this systematic procedure becomes rapidly untractable , since the effective interactions depend on an increasing number of variables .",
    "an alternative approach is to restrict the effective interactions between polymer c.m.s at finite concentrations to a sum of pair potentials , the latter being determined by an inversion procedure of the c.m .",
    "pair distribution function based on integral equations for the pair structure of classical fluids @xcite .",
    "the price to pay is that the resulting pair potentials now depend on polymer concentration , in addition to temperature .",
    "the variation with concentration is moderate , but significant , in the case of the saw model for polymers in good solvent @xcite , and becomes very strong for polymers in poor solvent @xcite .    since the effective pair potentials are obtained by inverting c.m .",
    "pair correlation data from mc simulations , this strong variation with polymer concentration means that full monomer - level simulations must be carried out for each thermodynamic state of the polymer solution , thus partly defeating the purpose of the coarse - graining strategy .",
    "it is hence important to explore numerically less demanding theoretical methods for the determination of the required polymer pair correlation functions .",
    "one obvious candidate is the polymer reference interaction site model ( prism ) theory , which has proved very successful to determine the pair structure of interacting polymer solutions and melts @xcite .",
    "prism grew out of the rism integral equation of chandler and andersen @xcite for the pair structure of simple molecular fluids .",
    "the theory includes intramolecular connectivity via the macromolecular form factor , and provides accurate monomer - monomer pair distribution functions , @xmath10 .",

    ". pair distribution function , @xmath11 , which needs to be inverted to extract the effective c.m .- c.m .",
    "pair potential , @xmath3 , can be derived from @xmath10 by a simple , accurate relation which was established recently within the prism framework @xcite .",
    "this strategy , which is highly economical on computational resources , is explicitly carried out in this paper , on the basis of the gaussian thread model for interacting polymers @xcite .",
    "prism theory , in conjunction with an approximate closure relation , allows the monomer - monomer pair distribution function @xmath10 to be calculated analytically or numerically depending on the expression for the polymer form factor .",
    "pair distribution function is then extracted from @xmath10 using the relation of ref .",
    "@xcite together with appropriate form factors , and @xmath3 is finally obtained by hypernetted - chain ( hnc ) inversion @xcite .",
    "the variation of the effective pair potential with temperature and polymer concentration is then examined in detail , and compared to the `` exact '' results extracted from mc simulations @xcite .",
    "we consider solutions of @xmath4 linear polymers made up of @xmath12 freely jointed monomers or segments of diameter @xmath13 and spacing @xmath14 .",
    "monomers belonging to the same or different chains are not allowed to overlap , i.e. they experience an infinite mutual repulsion for monomer - monomer distances @xmath15 , and , for @xmath16 , they attract each other via a yukawa interaction , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the energy scale and @xmath19 the range of the monomer - monomer attraction @xcite .",
    "the relevant thermodynamic variables are the temperature @xmath9 [ as usual , we define @xmath20 and the polymer concentration @xmath21 ( number of polymer coils per unit volume ) ; the corresponding monomer density is @xmath22 . as usual , the spatial extension of the chain will be characterized by its radius of gyration @xmath23 and the polymer overlap concentration , at which different chains start to overlap , is defined as @xmath24 . in this model of polymer solutions ,",
    "the attractive interaction ( [ yukawa.eq ] ) represents solvent mediated monomer - monomer interactions in an effective way .",

    "while self - consistent schemes exist to compute the latter as a function of temperature and density , they are quite complex to implement @xcite . in the present work , we will make the simplifying assumption that the polymers obey gaussian statistics .",
    "this approximation , which is in principle only valid in the melt or close to the @xmath1 temperature , is mainly needed for technical reasons , due to the lack of analytical results for non - gaussian polymers .",
    "thus , the form factor @xmath36 is given by the well - known debye expression for ideal chains in the continuum limit , namely @xcite @xmath37,\\ x = qr_g.\\ ] ] replacing this exact form by its simple pad approximant , @xmath38 allows analytic results to be obtained within the thread limit @xcite , but we will see in the following that it can lead to significant problems in the present context .",
    "in this work , we are interested in a mesoscopic level of description of polymer systems . for simplicity",
    ", it is thus useful to get rid of the microscopic details of the polymer model .",
    "a way of doing this in the prism framework is by taking the so - called thread limit . in the case of excluded volume interactions",
    "only , it is defined by letting @xmath13 and @xmath14 go to zero and @xmath12 to infinity , keeping the ratio @xmath39 , @xmath8 and @xmath40 constant @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the attractive part of the monomer - monomer interaction potential was left untouched when taking the thread limit .",
    "however , for simple polymers , it turns out that the range of this attractive tail scales with the monomer size .",
    "thus for this work it seemed physically appropriate to supplement the previous limiting process with the limit of a vanishing range of the attractive potential , namely @xmath41 , keeping the ratio @xmath42 constant . this can be interpreted as a special limit of the theory of refs .",
    "@xcite , as shown in appendix [ thread.app ] .    to escape the trivial case of non - interacting polymers , the thread limit requires a proper formulation of the closures of the prism - oz equation ( [ prismozthread.eq ] ) as well . in this work",

    "@xmath46 , which depends on @xmath47 only , is obtained by imposing that , in the presence of excluded volume interactions only ( i.e. for infinite temperature ) , @xmath48 obeys the hard core condition , @xmath49 .",

    "we first consider in the next section the situation where the interaction site for the effective interaction between polymer coils is chosen to be a monomer ; subsequently effective interactions between polymer c.m.s are discussed in sec .",
    "[ vcc.sec ] .",
    "starting from the original polymer system , the choice of the effective coordinates used to specify the position of each polymer coil , and relative to which the coarse - graining procedure is performed , is largely arbitrary .",
    "most of the time , the center of mass is considered , but it has sometimes been suggested to use specific monomers , like the midpoint or the endpoints , as in refs .",
    "this is a very natural choice for star polymers as well , where the star center provides an obvious reference point @xcite . in this section",
    ", we thus attempt to build such a monomer - monomer ( or site - site ) effective interaction .    in the present prism - based approach , by construction",
    ", no distinction is made between the different monomers on a chain .",
    "however , one can build an effective monomer - monomer interaction based on the concept of an average monomer @xcite .",
    "the idea goes as follows . on each chain",

    "this free energy over the random locations of the tagged monomers on their chains then leads to a quantity which can be given the meaning of an effective interaction between average monomers .    in practice",

    "we first consider the case of excluded volume interactions only , i.e. @xmath57 . the analytic @xmath56 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ vaa.fig ] for various polymer densities .",
    "it diverges at zero separation and , when the density increases , this divergence manifests itself at shorter distances and becomes steeper .",
    "at the same time , the repulsive tail of the potential becomes longer - ranged , as can be clearly seen on the plot of @xmath58 , a quantity playing a crucial role for the calculation of the thermodynamic properties of fluid systems characterized by similar `` soft '' interaction potentials @xcite .",
    "these results are in good qualitative agreement with the simulation data of bolhuis and louis for midpoint and endpoint effective pair potentials @xcite .",
    "recently , much attention has been devoted to the development of analytic expressions for effective pair potentials between the centers of star polymers in solution @xcite . since a linear polymer , seen from one of its endpoints or from its midpoint , can be identified with a one- or two - arm star , respectively , it is interesting to compare those calculations with the present theory .    since , according to eq .",
    "( [ hzero.eq ] ) , @xmath59 vanishes linearly for @xmath60 , @xmath56 diverges like @xmath61 .",
    "such a weak , logarithmic divergence is present in the star polymer models , where it has been derived using scaling arguments , but the prefactor , which should be given by the two - arm result in the limit of very long chains where end effects are expected to be negligible , appears overestimated by the present theory compared to scaling arguments ( which predict a prefactor equal to @xmath62 for a star with @xmath63 arms ) and renormalization group results @xcite .",
    "this quantitative disagreement is not surprising , since the present calculation relies on the use of gaussian form factors in good solvent conditions .",
    "however , a similar calculation done with an approximate form factor reproducing the correct asymptotic behavior of @xmath36 in good solvent still does not provide the correct value and this failure was in fact argued to be inherent to the thread prism approach @xcite .    for large distances",
    ", @xmath56 asymptotically takes a yukawa form @xcite , @xmath64 such a long range behavior was postulated for star polymers , on the basis of the blob picture of the star inner structure .",
    "however , because the blob picture breaks down for small @xmath63 , it was advocated that this asymptotic behavior should not be valid for small functionalities , @xmath65 , and should be replaced by a gaussian tail , by analogy with the behavior of the effective pair potential between chain centers of mass @xcite .",
    "the present calculation does not appear to support this choice .",
    "finally , and maybe more importantly , the present calculation reveals that @xmath56 changes significantly with density .",
    "for instance , the range of the asymptotic yukawa tail more than doubles between @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "if such a behavior also applies to star polymers , it could have a major impact on the calculation of the thermodynamic properties of these systems , in particular on their phase diagrams .    in fig .",
    "[ vaacomp.fig ] , the numerically determined @xmath68 for the exact debye form factor ( [ debye.eq ] ) is compared to the analytic result obtained with the pad approximant ( [ omegaapp.eq ] ) , at various polymer densities .",
    "a thorough analysis shows that the differences between both are only quantitative .",
    "both share the same @xmath61 divergence for small separations , and both display an asymptotic yukawa tail , which is of shorter range when ( [ debye.eq ] ) is used .",
    "comparison of the effective pair potentials between average monomers [ multiplied by @xmath69 obtained with the exact and approximate polymer form factors , ( [ debye.eq ] ) and ( [ omegaapp.eq ] ) respectively , at various densities , in the presence of excluded volume interactions only . from left to right : @xmath70 . ]",
    "we now turn to the effect of the attractive monomer - monomer interaction with changing temperature . in fig .",
    "[ vaatemp.fig ] , the analytic @xmath56 calculated with the approximate chain form factor ( [ omegaapp.eq ] ) is plotted at density @xmath71 for various values of the temperature .",
    "similar results are obtained at all densities , and with the exact debye form factor as well . the effective potential is seen to become less repulsive when the temperature is decreased from @xmath72 to @xmath45 , it vanishes identically at @xmath45 and grows more and more attractive if the temperature is further decreased .",
    "this trend reverts when the `` spinodal '' line is approached , leading to non - monotonous , mostly repulsive effective potentials of increasing range .    but a word of caution is needed here . indeed ,",
    "as shown in appendix [ thread.app ] , at all finite temperatures , the hard core condition @xmath49 is no longer obeyed .",
    "thus , the effective pair potential between average monomers does not diverge at full overlap as it should , if this condition was consistently enforced at all state points",
    ". this might not be so important , since , as it has already been mentioned , the product @xmath58 is in general more relevant than the potential itself , and in this quantity the short range details of the potential are strongly reduced by the vanishing prefactor .",
    "another source of concern is that it is not known to what extent the results obtained below @xmath45 when approaching the `` spinodal '' line are physically meaningful , since the corresponding remnant of a binodal line , which would properly identify the domain of existence of the low density phase , is not known in the present theory @xcite . for these reasons ,",
    "the present results are only given for reference and would need to be validated , both by implementing alternative integral equation schemes or by investigating @xmath56 as a function of temperature by molecular simulation .",
    "effective pair potentials between average monomers , obtained with the approximate polymer form factor ( [ omegaapp.eq ] ) , at various temperatures , for the reduced density @xmath71 . ]    to summarize , we have shown in this section that integral equation theories for macromolecular systems , like the present thread prism theory , could be useful tools to compute monomer - based effective interaction potentials between polymers . at least in the case of excluded volume interactions only , they lead to very reasonable predictions for the effective interactions between average monomers on polymer chains , compared to the presently available simulation and theoretical results .",
    "but , the concept of an average monomer , which is needed in the present theory because , at variance with star polymers , there is no obvious choice of a reference monomer , is rather artificial and in practice conceals significant technical difficulties .",
    "indeed , this concept has a simple meaning only in the limit of very long chains , where all monomers can be considered as equivalent . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effective interactions between central monomers and between end monomers have been found to differ considerably , showing that strong finite length effects should be expected on effective interactions between average monomers .",
    "thus , for a better control of these finite size effects , an alternative approach seems desirable , and it has been found that considering effective interactions between polymer c.m.s is appropriate in this respect .",

    "[ prism.sec ] , on physical grounds , we supplement the previously applied limiting process with the limit of a vanishing range of the attractive potential , namely @xmath41 , keeping the ratio @xmath42 constant . to take this supplementary limit in the rmpy / hta closure , we need to evaluate @xmath130 .",
