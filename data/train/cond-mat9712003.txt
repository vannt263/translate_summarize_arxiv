    "copper - oxides with a @xmath0 plane containing line - defects , which results in ladder - like arrangments of @xmath1-atoms@xcite , have recently received considerable attention@xcite .",
    "in addition to being interesting physical systems themselves@xcite , they may be considered , on the theoretical side , as an important stepping - stone to understand the fully @xmath2 @xmath0 planes of cuprate superconductors .",
    "namely their special geometry makes two - legged ladders a realization of a particularly simple ` rvb'-type state , and developing a ` technology ' for handling such rvb states clearly is one of the key issues in the theory of high - temperature superconductors . in the following ,",
    "we want to derive a simple theoretical description of the spin dynamics and single - hole dynamics of ladders .",
    "thereby we follow an approach which is similar in spirit to the landau theory of fermi liquids : we use a simple picture of an ` rvb spin liquid ' and its excitation spectrum and parameterize the dispersion of the spin excitations by few parameters , which are then obtained by matching the results to lanczos calculations and finite - size analysis . using this parameterization",
    "we make quantitative predictions for various dynamical correlation functions which can be compared to exact diagonalization ( and experiment ) .",
    "the theory actually allows to make rather detailed predictions , which in all cases studied are in good agreement with lanczos results .",
    "we also discuss possibilities to extend the calculation to @xmath2 systems .",
    "+ we consider the standard @xmath3 model on a @xmath4-leg ladder with @xmath5 rungs .",
    "more precisely , the hamiltonian reads @xmath6 here @xmath7 denotes a summation over all pairs of nearest neighbors on the ladder , for bonds along the legs we choose @xmath8 and @xmath9 , for bonds along the rungs @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in the following",
    "we adopt the values @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , which may be roughly appropriate for actual the materials .",
    "we choose the @xmath15-axis along the direction of the legs , the @xmath16-axis along the rungs .",
    "to begin with , we consider the case of half - filling and , following ref.@xcite define the following operators : @xmath17 these create either a singlet or the three components of a triplet on the sites @xmath18 and @xmath19 . following a large number of workers@xcite",
    ", we will start out from the ` rung - rvb state ' , @xmath20 , which is the ground state in the limit @xmath21 ( here @xmath22 denotes the nearest neighbor of @xmath18 in @xmath16-direction ) .",
    "let us now consider the effect of switching on @xmath23 .",
    "obviously this will create ` fluctuations ' in the vacuum state , and it is of importance to clarify the nature of these .",
    "due to the product nature of the vacuum it is sufficient to consider just one @xmath24-site plaquette , see figure [ fig1 ] for the labelling of sites .",
    "for @xmath23@xmath25@xmath26 the ground state is @xmath27 , with energy @xmath28 .",
    "it might appear that the fluctuation with the lowest cost in energy would be a ` @xmath29-degree swap ' , i.e. a transition to a state with singlets along the legs : @xmath30@xmath25@xmath31 .",
    "this state has energy @xmath32 , i.e. it is degenerate with the vacuum in the limit @xmath33@xmath25@xmath23 .",
    "this line of thinking , however , is incorrect .",
    "the reason is that @xmath30 is not orthogonal to the vacuum , more precisely one finds @xmath34 .",
    "the most natural way to proceed is to form the orthogonal complement @xmath35 , which ( after normalization ) is found to be @xmath36 the ( manifestly rotation invariant ) expression on the r.h.s .",
    "thereby is nothing but the clebsch - gordan combination of two triplets along the rungs into a singlet .",
    "this shows , that the ` true ' excitation is the double triplet , rather than a state with singlets along the legs , or , put another way , that the state @xmath30 is redundant and can be discarded if we keep @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the same holds true for the last candidate state for a fluctuation , namely two triplets along the legs coupled to a singlet : @xmath39 again we find that this state is not orthogonal to the vacuum either , and orthogonalization again yields @xmath38 .",
    "the only fluctuation we have to take into account therefore is the formation of two triplets on adjacent rungs , the respective matrix element is @xmath40 .",
    "the energy increases by @xmath41 , which we interpret as twice the ` energy of formation ' of a single triplet .",
    "let us now assume that a double triplet has been formed , and consider its further development .",
    "first , the two triplets can ` recombine ' and we return to the vacuum ; the matrix element for this process again is @xmath42 .",
    "second , the two triplets can ` swap their species ' .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath43@xmath44@xmath45 there is a matrix element of the form @xmath46@xmath25@xmath47 .",
    "the last possibility is that one of the triplets interacts with a singlet on the as yet ` untouched ' rung next to it . to study this in more detail we consider a @xmath24-site plaquette containing spin @xmath48 .",
    "it is convenient to form the states @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "they are triplets with @xmath51-component @xmath26 .",
    "next we consider which state could mix with one of these states . a first possibility would be two ` rung triplets ' , coupled to a triplet : latexmath:[\\[|4\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } ( t_{14,x}^\\dagger t_{23,y}^\\dagger - t_{14,y}^\\dagger t_{23,x}^\\dagger )    @xmath15-reflection , whereas @xmath53 both have negative parity .",
    "this state therefore can not be admixed@xcite .",
    "the next possibility is latexmath:[\\[|5 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } ( t_{12,z}^\\dagger s_{43}^\\dagger - s_{12}^\\dagger t_{43,z}^\\dagger )    @xmath15-parity ) , but this state is actually identical to @xmath55 . finally , one could think of two triplets along the legs coupled to form a triplet : @xmath56 .",
    "the ` 90-degree swap ' to a triplet along the leg ( see the state @xmath57 ) would give a redundant state and , most importantly , ` anharmonic processes ' whereby a triplet decays into two triplets ( see the states @xmath57 or @xmath58 ) are not possible either .",
    "clearly , this absence of anharmonicity leads to a considerable simplification of the physics - it is the ultimate reason why , as will be seen later , the spin correlation function in a ladder is remarkably ` coherent ' .",
    "+ there is one last process we need to discuss .",
    "it may happen that two triplets of unlike species which have been created in different pair creation processes ` collide ' .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath59 there is a matrix element of the type @xmath60@xmath25@xmath42 , which describes two triplets of unlike species ` hopping over ' one another .",
    "+ we now represent the presence of a triplet on the @xmath61 rung by the presence of a ` book - keeping boson ' created by @xmath62 . grouping the three possible triplet states into a single 3-vector , @xmath63@xmath25@xmath64",
    ", we can describe all processes involving non - redundant states by the following manifestly rotation - invariant hamiltonian @xmath65 this hamiltonian has also been derived by gopalan _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "the form of the hamiltonian ( [ eff ] ) suggests a quite obvious approximation , namely to break down the quartic terms in a bcs - like fashion , e.g. : @xmath66 as a next step , we might assume that the hopping integrals and pair creation matrix elements in ( [ eff ] ) are renormalized in a gutzwiller - like fashion , to mimic the effect of the hard - core constraint .",
    "after fourier transform , we would thus arrive at an approximate hamiltonian of the form @xmath67 . \\label{eff1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assuming that the @xmath68 in this hamiltonian are _ free bosons _ this is readily solved by the ansatz @xmath69 to give the ( @xmath70-fold degenerate ) dispersion @xmath71 the parameters @xmath72 , @xmath73 should be calculated in some approximate fashion , by mean - field and gutzwiller - approximation to the original hamiltonian ( [ eff])@xcite .",
    "we note , however , that there are a number of difficulties with such an approach : the density of bosons @xmath74 can be obtained from the spin correlation function along the rungs using the identity @xmath75 .",
    "the spin correlation function thereby can be estimated from exact diagonalization results .",
    "for @xmath76 we thus obtain @xmath77 .",
    "the quantum fluctuations thus are strong , and we may expect that the matrix elements for propagation and pair creation in ( [ eff ] ) are heavily renormalized . on the other hand",
    ", the matrix elements of the quartic terms in ( [ eff ] ) will not be renormalized at all due to the hard - core constraint , because these terms do not change the boson occupation of any site .",
    "we may thus expect a subtle interplay of gutzwiller projection and mean - field decomposition and to avoid poorly controlled approximations we resort to numerical techniques to extract the parameters of the hamiltonian ( [ eff1 ] ) and , in doing so , moreover check the quality of the mapping to noninteracting bosons _ per se_. to that end we define the operator @xmath78 if the rung @xmath79 is in a singlet state , @xmath80 transforms it into the @xmath51-component of the triplet ; if the rung is in any of the triplet states , the state is annihilated .",
    "this operator , while acting entirely within the hilbert space of the original ladder system , thus may be viewed as a realization of the hard - core boson creation operator .",
    "next , using standard lanczos techniques , we evaluate the following green s functions : @xmath81 where @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) denote the ground state wave function ( energy ) of the ladder and @xmath84 is the ( 1 dimensional ) fourier transform of @xmath85 .",
    "our goal is to map the spin excitations of the ladder onto a system of free ` quasi - bosons ' goverened by the hamiltonian ( [ eff1 ] ) .",
    "if we want to compare spectral properties , we have to take into account that the _ spectral weight _ of the hard - core bosons may be strongly renormalized .",
    "for example , as a rigorous identity we have @xmath86\\rangle$]@xmath25@xmath87@xmath88@xmath89 , rather than @xmath48 as it would be for free bosons . to discuss the spectral functions we therefore assume that @xmath90@xmath91@xmath92 , where @xmath93 is a free boson operator , and @xmath94 the wave function renormalization constant .",
    "+ assuming then that the free bosons @xmath93 are indeed described by a hamiltonian of the form ( [ eff1 ] ) one can derive the following expressions for the above green s functions : @xmath95 in other words , the wave function renormalization @xmath94 as well as the energy @xmath72 and pair creation amplitude @xmath73 can be read off from the dispersion of the _ pole strength _ in the green s functions ( [ theory ] ) .",
    "then , using the obtained values of @xmath72 and @xmath73 to calculate the dispersion of the _ excitation energy _ from ( [ tdisp ] ) and comparing with the actual numerical values should provide a stringent cross - check for the validity of the mapping to the free - boson hamiltonian ( [ eff1 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] compares @xmath96 and @xmath97 and @xmath98 . to begin with",
    ", the @xmath96 shows a series of sharp dispersive peaks , which however trace out a rather unusual dispersion with a shallow local minimum at @xmath99@xmath25@xmath26 .",
    "next , @xmath97 has a pronounced low energy peak too , which coincides with that of @xmath96 .",
    "the residuum changes sign at approximately @xmath100 ( note that @xmath101 is an _ off - diagonal _ matrix element of the resolvent operator ; its residuum therefore need not be positive definite ) , the magnitude is nearly identical at @xmath99@xmath25@xmath26 and @xmath99@xmath25@xmath102 .",
    "this suggests a @xmath99-dependence of the form @xmath103 , as one would expect for a pair amplitude corresponding to pair creation on nearest neighbors .",
    "similarly , @xmath98 shows low energy peaks coniciding with those of @xmath96 .",
    "the dispersion of the weight , however , is more complicated than for the pairing amplitude .",
    "for a quantitative analysis , we proceed to figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "part ( a ) shows first of all the weight @xmath94 obtained from @xmath104 .",
    "remarkably enough , @xmath94 is quite independent of @xmath99 and moreover close to the estimate of @xmath89 obtained from @xmath86\\rangle$ ] . the fact that @xmath94 is indeed fairly @xmath99-independent is a first indication for the applicability of a free boson hamiltonian . to avoid a proliferation of adjustable parameters we take the @xmath99-average , which is @xmath94@xmath25@xmath105 ( nearly independent of @xmath5 for @xmath106 ) . using this value of @xmath94",
    "we then calculated the @xmath72 and @xmath73 and fourier transform them with respect to @xmath99 . for simplicity",
    ", we terminate the fourier series after the third ( i.e. @xmath107-like ) term .",
    "this gives already a very satisfactory fit to the data , as seen in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "figure [ fig3]b shows the comparison of the numerical excitation energy and the dispersion calculated from ( [ tdisp ] ) , using the values of @xmath72 and @xmath73 extracted from the weights of the correlation functions .",
    "there is quite reasonable agreement , which indicates that the effective free - boson hamiltonian itself is a quite good description of the spin dynamics .",
    "+ we proceed to extrapolate the results to the infinite chain . to that end",
    ", we performed the calculation for different @xmath5 and calculated the fourier coefficients of @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "then , figures [ fig3](c ) and ( d ) show plots of these fourier coefficients vs. @xmath108 .",
    "the plots rather obviously suggest that all of the fourier coefficients can be    expressed as @xmath109 to good accuracy .",
    "the extrapolated values @xmath110 are given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we note in passing that these values give a ` spin gap ' ( i.e. the energy of the triplet with @xmath111 ) of @xmath112 , in agreement with exact diagonalization@xcite and dmrg calculations@xcite .",
    "let us now briefly discuss these values . for the pairing amplitude @xmath73 we have a by far dominant @xmath113-component , @xmath114 , consistent with pair creation / annihilation on nearest neighbors .",
    "the second - nearest neighbor amplitude is substantially smaller , and also the uniform component is very small .",
    "+ the results for the renormalized energy @xmath72 are more surprising . to begin with",
    ", the constant term is @xmath115 , rather than @xmath33@xmath25@xmath23 , as one would expect .",
    "a possible explanation for this strong increase is that a triplet on ( say ) the rung number @xmath18 blocks the ` pair creation ' of triplets on the pairs @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "the corresponding loss of fluctuation energy increases the energy cost for creating a triplet , i.e. the on - site energy of a triplet .",
    "in addition , presence of a triplet will partially inhibit the motion of other triplets and thus cause a further loss of delocalization energy .",
    "quite obviously these effects combined are quite substantial .",
    "next , the coefficient of the nearest - neighbor harmonic is rather small ( only @xmath118 ) .",
    "this may be understood simply in terms of a gutzwiller - like reduction of the mobility due to the ` excluded volume ' occupied by other triplets .",
    "moreover , the terms which describe the ` exchange hopping ' and effectively propagate a triplet by one lattice site may interfere destructively with the ` ordinary ' motion of a triplet , and thus reduce the effective hopping integral .",
    "a further surprise is the large amplitude for second - nearest neighbor hopping . here",
    "one could envisage processes where the propagating triplet encounters a pair of triplets , recombines with one of them and thereby transfers its momentum to the remaining triplet , so that the propagating triplet effectively has been transferred by two sites .",
    "such a process would be proportional to the probability of finding a quantum fluctuation , which is rather high in the present case .",
    "all in all , the data show that the propagation of the triplets is strongly renormalized in the relatively dense and strongly interacting ` background ' of the other triplets .",
    "+ assuming that the ` effective hamiltonian ' ( [ eff1 ] ) with the extrapolated parameters in table [ tab1 ] gives a good description of the spin dynamics , we proceed to calculate dynamical correlation functions relevant to experiment .",
    "we consider the spin operator on a single rung and ` translate it ' into the language of the hard - core bosons .",
    "the operator @xmath119@xmath25@xmath120 turns a singlet into an @xmath43-triplet and vice versa ; the other two types of triplets are annihilated , whence : @xmath121@xmath25@xmath122@xmath123@xmath124 .",
    "next , the operator @xmath125@xmath25@xmath126 annihilates a singlet and converts e.g. @xmath127@xmath91@xmath128 ( compare ( [ triplets ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath121@xmath25@xmath126 therefore must be bilinear in the triplet operators and the only possibility is @xmath129 . from its acting on @xmath127",
    "the prefactor must be @xmath130 , whence : @xmath121@xmath25@xmath126@xmath91@xmath131 .",
    "obviously this is also the only way to construct a hermitean operator ( @xmath121@xmath25@xmath126 is the operator of total spin on one rung ) from the triplets .",
    "a subtle point is the renormalization of the spectral weight : whereas @xmath121@xmath25@xmath120 actually changes the number of quasi - bosons and thus should be renormalized in a similar fashion as the hard - core boson addition and removal spectra , @xmath121@xmath25@xmath126 does not change the boson occupation of any rung and thus should remain essentially unrenormalized . based on these considerations , we multiply @xmath121@xmath25@xmath120 by @xmath132 , but leave @xmath121@xmath25@xmath126 unrenormalized . then , upon fourier transformation of the single rung operators and switching to the bond - bosons we obtain the spin correlation functions : @xmath133 note that @xmath134 for @xmath135 ; this is what must come out because unlike conventional spin - wave theory the ` rung - rvb ' state is an exact singlet , and both hamiltonians , ( [ eff ] ) and ( [ eff1 ] ) are rotationally invariant ; the ground state thus is an exact singlet , whence the operator of total spin must annihilate it .",
    "the obtained spin correlation functions are shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "we first note the rather different intensity of the two correlations functions . as    could be expected on the basis of ( [ scs ] ) , the correlation function for @xmath136@xmath25@xmath102 consists essentially of a single peak , whereas the spectrum for @xmath136@xmath25@xmath26 has more ` cusp - like ' appearance .",
    "it is interesting to note that these differences are reproduced quite well by the results of lanczos calculation , which are also shown in figure ( [ fig4 ] ) : the @xmath136@xmath25@xmath102 spectrum is indeed remarkably sharp , with nearly all the spectral weight concentrated in just one peak for every momentum . it should be noted that the agreement of the dispersion is not really surprising , this was actually seen already in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the dispersion of the _ peak intensity _ , however , also agrees very well with the lanczos result and thus provides further evidence for the correctness of the mapping to the boson hamiltonian .",
    "+ by contrast , the spectra for @xmath137 usually consist of several peaks and one can already envisage how these spectra develop into the cusp - like spectra produced by our theory .",
    "the dispersion of the ` peaks ' for @xmath136@xmath25@xmath26 is in good agreement with theory , showing a shallow maximum at @xmath138@xmath88@xmath139 and approaching zero for @xmath140 .",
    "all in all , the spin correlation function is obviously very well reproduced by our calculation .",
    "we proceed to a discussion of the ` energy correlation function ' @xmath141 , i.e. the dynamical correlation function of the operator @xmath142 apart from being a further probe of the spin dynamics , this correlation function plays a key role in the theory of phonon - assisted two - magnon absorption by lorenzana and sawatzky@xcite .",
    "it therefore can be probed experimentally in infra - red absorption measurements . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the operator @xmath143 , which is easy to ` translate ' to the quasi - boson system .",
    "namely one can replace @xmath144 whence @xmath145 since @xmath143 does not change the number of bosons on any rung , we have not added a factor of @xmath94 .",
    "the other correlation function , @xmath146 is more difficult . in principle , the exchange along a given bond along the legs of the ladder is nothing but the respective part of the effective hamiltonian ( [ eff ] ) .",
    "however , as has been discussed above , if we go over to the simplified hamiltonian ( [ eff1 ] ) there is quite a strong renormalization and also a generation of additional next - nearest - neighbor hopping terms .",
    "we believe this is difficult to treat in a reasonably controlled    way and therefore omit a discussion of this correlation function .",
    "then , @xmath147 is shown in figure [ fig5 ] and compared to lanczos results . unlike the spin correlation function , the detailed agreement of the lineshape between the theory and lanczos is not very good , with the discrepancy being particularly large around @xmath148@xmath25@xmath26 . there",
    ", the lanczos result shows an intense peak at an energy of @xmath149 , which is completely absent in the theoretical spectra .",
    "we believe that this peak corresponds to a ` bi - triplet ' , i.e. a bound state of two triplets on nearest neighbors .",
    "two triplets on nearest neighbors can efficiently lower their energy by using the exchange - like interaction described by the quartic terms in ( [ eff ] ) .",
    "this may produce a virtual bound state similar as the bimagnon excitation familiar from the raman spectrum of the @xmath2 heisenberg antiferromagnet .",
    "our simple particle - hole picture for the correlation function naturally does not take into account such a bound state formation and therefore can not reproduce this resonance . on the other hand , for momenta which are more distant from @xmath148@xmath25@xmath26 the agreement between lanczos and theory improves somewhat .",
    "the theoretical spectra reproduce the lower edge and ` width ' of the spetra reasonably well , and also the @xmath150-dependence of the total spectral weight is approximately correct .",
    "next , we proceed to a theory for photoemission@xcite . to that end",
    ", we need to study the motion of a single hole in the ` spin background ' .",
    "the previous discussion has shown that we needed to retain only singlets and triplets along the rungs and that , as far as the spin dynamics is concerned , all other possible states are redundant .",
    "this suggests to discuss the added hole in such a way that it ` fits ' with the rung basis used for discussing the spin dynamics .",
    "we define bonding and antibonding states of one electron along a rung : @xmath151 where we have represented the parity under @xmath152 as momentum @xmath26 or @xmath102 in @xmath16-direction .",
    "these states have an ` on site energy ' of @xmath153 and we now consider their propagation .",
    "the goal thereby is to interpret a singly occupied rung as being occupied by an ` effective fermion ' , which has the @xmath51-spin and @xmath154 of the respective single - electron state .",
    "then we want to enlarge the effective hamiltonian ( [ eff1 ] ) by terms describing the propagation of these effective fermions as well as their interaction with the triplet excitations .",
    "+ the form of the terms in this effective hamiltonian can be inferred already from the requirements of positive parity under @xmath152 , spin rotation and time - reversal invariance and hermiticity .",
    "we note that the rung - singlet and @xmath155 have positive parity under @xmath152 , whereas the triplets and @xmath156 have negative parity .",
    "then , from the spinors @xmath157 we can construct two @xmath70-vectors @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the vector of pauli matrices .",
    "thereby @xmath160 has odd parity under exchange of the legs , @xmath161 has even parity , and we have @xmath162@xmath25@xmath163 . both vectors are odd under time reversal ( as is @xmath124 ) .",
    "the processes we need to describe are shown schematically in figure [ processes ] : by virtue    the hopping term a singly occupied rung can exchange its position with a ` fully occupied ' rung .",
    "thereby the fully occupied rung can remain in a singlet , change from singlet to triplet ( and vice versa ) , remain in a given triplet state , or remain in a triplet state but change its @xmath164 .",
    "these processes can be described by the following coupling terms , whose form follows simply from the requirements of spin rotation invariance , even parity , and hermiticity : @xmath165 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & c_2 \\sum_n [ \\ ; \\bbox{t}_n^\\dagger\\cdot ( \\bar{n}_{n+1 } \\bbox{s}_{n , n+1 } + \\bar{n}_{n-1 } \\bbox{s}_{n , n-1 } )   + h.c . ]",

    "denoting the hopping term along the legs by @xmath169 we find : @xmath170 next , starting from the state @xmath171 we obtain @xmath172 using these two equations we find @xmath173@xmath25@xmath174 , @xmath175@xmath25@xmath68 , @xmath176@xmath25@xmath174 , and @xmath177@xmath25@xmath178 . + next , we consider the action of the exchange terms along the legs .",
    "namely the electron on a singly occupied rung can exchange with an electron belonging to a singlet or triplet on a neighboring rung .",

    "( [ eff1 ] ) then gives a complete description for the hole motion in the ladder .",
    "+ having found all possible ways of interaction between the hole and the spin excitations , we need to consider a suitable approximation to handle these terms . to begin with , by treating the terms @xmath184 in ( [ c_hopp ] ) in a mean - field like way",

    "will ` block ' quantum fluctuations and hamper the propagation of other triplets , a singly occupied rung will do the same . for the triplets ,",
    "this effect has led to a quite dramatic increase of the ` energy of formation ' of the triplet .",
    "however , the corresponding renormalization of the on - site energy for the hole - like fermions is most likely independent of the @xmath154 of the hole , and hence can be absorbed into an overall constant shift of the spectral function . since , the hole will not be able to propagate by two lattice sites by coupling to a quantum fluctuation , so that we expect that unlike the case of spin excitations there will be no ` dynamically generated ' next - nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "+ performing the fourier and bogoliubov transform we finally arrive at the following hamiltonian @xmath195 \\nonumber \\\\ \\epsilon_{\\bbox{k } } & = & 2t_{eff}\\ ; \\cos(k_x ) - t_\\perp \\cos(k_y ) , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "m(\\bbox{k},\\bbox{q } ) & = & \\delta_{q_y,\\pi}\\ ; [ \\ ; ( 2 t \\cos(k_x - q_x ) + j\\cos(q_x ) ) u_{q_x } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\;&\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; - ( 2 t \\cos(k_x ) + j\\cos(q_x ) ) v_{q_x}\\;].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thereby it is understood that @xmath196 has only one branch with @xmath136@xmath25@xmath26 .",
    "formally , this is already very similar to the hamiltonian derived by schmidt - rink _ et al._@xcite for hole motion in a heisenberg antiferromagnet ; the only differences are that we have spinful holes , a nonvanishing dispersion @xmath197 already for the ` bare holes ' , and @xmath70 branches of spin excitations rather than @xmath48 . in short ,",
    "the hamiltonian is explicitely spin - rotation invariant , as it has to be in a ` spin liquid ' .",
    "technically this does not make any difference and the equation for the self - energy @xmath198 reads now @xmath199 the self - consistency equation can be solved for relatively large systems ( we used @xmath200@xmath201 ) , and the self - energy be used to calculate the hole - like photoemission spectrum @xmath202 if we want to compare this spectrum with lanczos results@xcite , some care is necessary .",
    "the reason is that the spectral function we have calculated above is the one for the creation of a ` bare ' hole .",
    "when calculating the photoemission spectrum , i.e. the spectral function of the operator @xmath203 , there exists the possibility that the annihilation operator ` hits ' a rung in a triplet state . this will lead to terms of the form @xmath204 in the photoemission operator , i.e. the creation of the hole is accompanied by the annihilation of a spin excitation .",
    "if we want to have numerical results for the bare hole spectral function , we therefore should use the fourier transform of the operator @xmath205.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this operator replaces a rung - singlet by a singly occupied bond with the proper @xmath154 , and annihilates any triplet .",
    "this may therefore be considered as a creation operator for a ` bare ' hole .",
    "then , figure ( [ fig7 ] ) compares the ` bare hole ' spectral function obtained by the self - consistent born approximation and the lanczos spectra of the operator @xmath206 .",
    "the agreement is obviously quite good , although the self - consistent born result tends to produce ` too coherent ' spectra and does not put enough weight    into incoherent continua .",
    "this may be an indication that our renormalization of the coupling matrix element @xmath207 by @xmath208 is too strong - a larger coupling would presumably lead to more incoherent weight .",
    "the key features , however , are essentially identical in both spectra : the intense band in the @xmath154@xmath25@xmath26 sector , which disperses slightly upwards from @xmath99@xmath25@xmath26 towards @xmath99@xmath25@xmath209 and then more or less levels off ; the equally intense band in the @xmath210 sector , which starts out at @xmath99@xmath25@xmath102 , disperses towards lower energy and quickly becomes ` overdamped ' .",
    "the scb results somewhat underestimate the bandwidth of the @xmath154@xmath25@xmath26 quasiparticle band and put the @xmath154@xmath25@xmath26 at a somewhat too high energy .",
    "the former could probably be remedied by adjustment of the ` bare hole hopping integral ' @xmath190 - however , since there is no rigorous way to do so , we decided not to do this .",
    "apart from these relatively minor problems , however , there is quite good agreement . + as a last remark we note that a comparison with the ` full ' photoemission spectrum@xcite shows quite substantial differences in the spectral weight of some features .",
    "the additional processes where the photoemission operator annihilates a quantum fluctuation ( in this case a triplet ) thus are quite important for a discussion of the true photoemission lineshape ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of this issue in the 2d systems ) .",
    "in summary , we have derived a simple theory of two - legged spin ladders which reproduces a number of numerical results quite well .",
    "being of comparable simplicity as linear spin wave theory for the planar heisenberg antiferromagnet , the theory nevertheless allows to make quantitative calculations of physical quantities , which in all cases compare favourably with the results of lanczos diagonalization .",
    "just as linear spin wave theory may be viewed as constructing an effective hamiltonian for the pair creation and propagation of fluctuations around the ` neel - vacuum ' , the present theory may be viewed as an entirely analogous expansion around the ` rvb - vacuum ' : the hamiltonians ( [ eff ] ) and ( [ eff1 ] ) may be thought of as describing the dynamics of triplet - like fluctuations around the rvb vacuum , and to discuss the hole dynamics we basically needed to describe the coupling between these triplet - excitations and the doped hole .",
    "the great simplification which made the calculation possible was the special geometry of the @xmath4-legged ladder which immediately suggested a unique rvb - vacuum around which we could ` expand ' the fluctuating ground state .",
    "we note that there actually exists another system with such a unique rvb - vacuum , namely the kondo lattice . for this system",
    "an analogous procedure involving _ fermionic _ fluctuations is possible and leads to excellent results when compared to lanczos diagonalization@xcite .",
    "+ in a two dimensional @xmath3-like system , such a unique vacuum does in general not exist , unless one were to assume some spatial inhomogeneities such as stripes@xcite .",
    "rather , for a translationally invariant state , the most natural vacuum would be a statistical average over all possible dimer - coverings of the plane , where each dimer corresponds to a singlet@xcite .",
    "the analogue of the triplet - like excitations in the ladder then would be states where one or several singlet - dimers are substituted by a triplet , and this excited dimer propagates through the system .",
    "in fact , up to an additional statistical averaging to account for the probability of suitable dimer configurations , the calculation of matrix elements for the pair creation and propagation of these excited dimers proceeds in an entirely analogous way as for the ladder@xcite .",
    "we note that such a picture for the low energy excitations of the rvb state is almost mandatory in the framework of the @xmath211 symmetric theory of cuprate superconductors by zhang@xcite : there , the @xmath102-operator , which actually accomplishes the @xmath211 rotations of spin - excited , half - filled states into doped , superconducting ground states@xcite precisely converts excited dimers with momentum @xmath212 into @xmath213 symmetric hole pairs with momentum @xmath214 .",
    "then , the simplest picture of the so(5 ) rotation from the antiferromagnetic to the superconducting state@xcite would be that a condensate of excited dimers with momentum @xmath212 at half - filling ( i.e. a state with nonvanishing staggered magnetization ) is converted into a condensate of @xmath215-like hole pairs ( i.e. a @xmath215-wave superconductor ) in the doped case .",
    "a description of the spin excitations in @xmath2 in terms of boson - like excited dimers as for the @xmath3 ladder thus may be a very natural starting point for this promising scenario . + instructive discussions with dr o. p. sushkov and dr e. arrigoni are most gratefully acknowledged .",
