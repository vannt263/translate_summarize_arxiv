    "the emergence of coherent structures in time and space though synchronization occurs across the entire breadth of science : vibrating atoms , firing neurons , flashing fireflies , clapping audiences etc . and",
    "has therefore been studied intensively from a mathematical viewpoint @xcite .",
    "synchronization is often analyzed in models which explicitly favor phase synchronization , e.g. in the seminal kuramoto model @xcite and in diffusively coupled models ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in these schemes",
    "the net - interaction between oscillators indeed vanishes in the synchronized state .",
    "however , in many cases , such as fireflies @xcite , cardiac cells , neuronal system and applauding audiences @xcite the interaction between oscillators consists in the exchange of brief pulses , which persist even when the system fully synchronize . since mirollo and strogatz s influential 1990 paper @xcite such systems are often described by a set of non - analytically evolving integrate - and - fire oscillators .",
    "each oscillator is described by a load variable , which is taken to have a concave dependence on a monotonously increasing phase .",
    "when the load reaches a certain threshold , relaxation occurs instantaneously and a pulse is send to all connected oscillators . receiving oscillators jump discontinuously forward by a given amount .",
    "for such systems mirollo and strogatz showed @xcite that full synchronization always occurs .",
    "later ernst , pawelzik and geisel @xcite demonstrated that for excitatory - only couplings , synchronization depends on phase lag , whereas the presence of inhibitory couplings leads to full in - phase synchronization .",
    "the treatment of pulse oscillators in terms of non - analytic integrate - and - fire oscillators is more a tradition than a necessity . in the present paper",
    "we assume that each oscillator is represented by a phase @xmath0 whose time @xmath1 derivative is always equal to a constant rate plus a sum of _ smooth _ but narrow pulses emitted by surrounding oscillators coupled with strength @xmath2 .",
    "synchronization ( asymptotically vanishing phase difference ) always occurs for this system if pulses arrive with a non - zero time lag @xmath3 for a very wide class of adjacencies , including the mean - field setting often considered in the literature .",
    "given the previous results for pulse oscillators @xcite and to illuminate the more detailed discussion below it is natural to begin our analysis of two pulse exchanging phases by considering dirac s delta pulses for the interaction .",
    "@xmath4 integrating the time derivatives tells us that @xmath5 `` jumps '' each time @xmath6 passes through an integer value , @xmath7 , and vise versa for @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath8 , it is straight forward to see , fig .",
    "[ fig : dirac_comb ] , that the two phases are unable to synchronize though in the case of a finite time delay they may leapfrog each other , as the jump of one oscillator can make the other skip its .",
    "obviously dirac delta pulses are unrealistic .",
    "pulses emitted by real systems will have a finite width and a smooth time dependence ( eq .  ( [ eq : general_eom ] ) below ) .",
    "the introduction of smooth pulses changes the behavior in an essential way .",
    "as will be explained below synchronization now takes place whenever a time lag is present , @xmath11 , and in this case complete synchronization occurs for all smooth pulses .    _ general model ",
    "_ we now consider @xmath12 coupled oscillators , each described by a single degree of freedom @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , and each with the same eigenfrequency @xmath15 : @xmath16 oscillators are coupled through an adjancency matrix @xmath17 and a feedback function @xmath18 which has period @xmath19 .",
    "it is only through @xmath18 that periodicity is implemented : @xmath20 describes the effect that the state of @xmath13 ( say , the flashing of a firefly ) has on any other oscillator . as opposed to other models often studied in synchronization , such as the kuramoto model @xcite , the effect of @xmath21 does not disappear in the synchronized state .",
    "we chose @xmath22 at all times such that @xmath0 are monotonically increasing functions in time .",
    "this is achieved by choosing @xmath23 . in our numerical study",
    "below we use a comb of normalised gaussians with period @xmath19 and width @xmath24 , @xmath25 , the jacobi theta function .    in natural systems",
    "time delay is inevitable .",
    "we show that @xmath26 is crucial for synchronization .",
    "we use this term in a strong sense : for any pair @xmath27 of oscillators @xmath28 with @xmath29 , _",
    "i.e._the phase difference between any two oscillators converges to an integer multiple of the period of @xmath21 , which implies @xmath30 . by inspection",
    "it is clear that for the synchronized state to exist indefinitely , @xmath31 needs to be independent of @xmath32 , which means that if synchronization takes place , the difference between any @xmath0 and the solution @xmath33 of @xmath34 with appropriate initial conditions vanishes asymptotically .",
    "provided @xmath35 , the eigenfrequency @xmath15 can be absorbed into @xmath21 , using @xmath36 .",
    "_ simple two oscillator case  _ we now demonstrate that under very general conditions the system in eq .",
    "( [ eq : general_eom ] ) will synchronize in the long time limit .",
    "first we consider the simple case of two oscillators , i.e. @xmath37 and @xmath38 . by considering @xmath39 ,",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath40 is periodic if @xmath41 , _ i.e._synchronization in the strong sense above does not occur without time delay , rather , entrainment is inevitable .",
    "however , integrating the equation of motion eq .",
    "( [ eq : general_eom ] ) numerically on the basis of a simple euler method suggests differently .",
    "better numerical schemes , such as the runge kutta @xcite method , remove the spurious synchronization , which depends on the integration time step and therefore hints at the rle of the time delay effectively implemented by the forward derivative used in the most nave euler scheme .",

    "_ mechanism  _ how is synchronization achieved ?",
    "[ fig : mechanism_theta ] shows @xmath107 and @xmath108 as a function of @xmath1 for @xmath37 .",
    "synchronization occurs because @xmath6 experiences a greater increase in speed by @xmath109 than @xmath5 does by @xmath110 .",
    "this asymmetry comes about because @xmath6 is relatively fast itself when @xmath111 goes through its maximum and @xmath5 is relatively slow when @xmath112 goes through its maximum . as a result",
    "the maximum @xmath112 is broadened as a function of time , and @xmath111 is narrowed ( this effect is minute and thus not visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : mechanism_theta ] ) . therefore , the maximum of @xmath113 enters into @xmath114 for a longer time period than @xmath115 enters into @xmath116 , leading to a speedup of @xmath6 relative to @xmath5 . in summary , synchronization is result of oscillator @xmath32 being slow or fast when going through the maximum of the function @xmath20 .",
    "what rle has the time delay in this ?",
    "the time delay ensures that the trailing oscillator @xmath6 receives a boost at a time when @xmath111 goes through a maximum , while the leading @xmath5 receives its boost at a time when @xmath112 goes through a local minimum . without the time delay",
    ", the effect of the speed - up and the slowdown would indeed be perfectly symmetric .",
    "we notice that the mechanism underlying the synchronization supported by eq .",
    "( [ eq : general_eom ] ) is a kind of doppler effect that makes the received pulse change its duration when the sending oscillator changes its speed .",
    "we see that @xmath5 is ahead of @xmath6 , with the maximum of @xmath111 displaced by @xmath117 ( as indicated ) to the right relative to that of @xmath112 , as initialised . at a given time",
    ", @xmath6 still has to pass through the maximum of @xmath111 when @xmath5 already has .",
    "the phase speed @xmath118 is essentially @xmath119 shifted by @xmath3 to the right , as indicated by the dotted lines . as a result",
    ", the maximum of @xmath120 nearly aligns with the maximum of @xmath111 , _",
    "i.e._@xmath6 is fast when @xmath111 goes through the maximum ( dashed line ) , thereby narrowing it . in turn",
    ", @xmath5 passes very quickly through a low value of @xmath112 , relatively broadening in turn the maximum of @xmath112 . ]",
    "equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : general_eom ] ) provides a remarkably simple mechanism for synchronization . because oscillators lagging behind by a certain amount catch up in every period of @xmath121 by an amount of phase difference proportional to the phase difference at the beginning of the period",
    ", the model can immediately be extended to one with different eigenfrequencies @xmath122 of oscillators or some variation in @xmath123 with @xmath32 or of @xmath21 and even @xmath3 .",
    "an analysis of such extensions follows the derivation above , see @xcite .",
    "it will generally lead to entrainment .",
    "synchronisation by time delay is a viable explanation for natural synchronisation phenomena whenever oscilators respond to the duration of the pulse received .",
    "fireflies are known to be able to change the pulse duration and female fireflies are sensitive to that @xcite .",
