    ", it describes the dynamics of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in the mean field approximation @xcite or the propagation of laser beams in optical fibers @xcite , for which different expressions have been used for the nonlinearity of the refractive index @xcite .",
    "the cubic - quintic nlse @xcite is arguably the simplest model for competing nonlinearities @xcite and has been used in many different contexts , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite and references therein . in two transverse dimensions , which is a relevant case for non - linear optics , the cubic ( focusing)-quintic ( defocusing ) model ( cqnlse ) presents remarkable features .",
    "there are families of stable solitary waves ( solitons and vortices ) which become flattop when the power of the beam is large : the propagation constant never exceeds a critical value @xmath0 and , for growing power @xmath1 , there is a growing region where the amplitude also tends to a critical value @xmath2 , as was established by different numerical and analytical methods in @xcite and later rigorously proved in @xcite .",
    "this behaviour endows the flattop solutions of the cqnlse with the properties of a liquid @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 is a region of constant pressure and the rapid decay from @xmath3 to @xmath4 can be identified with a liquid - vapour interface characterized by a surface tension , leading to effects analogous to capillarity and dripping in regular liquids @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the first neat experimental realization of this liquid of light has been reported recently @xcite , following the proposal of @xcite of engineering the desired optical properties in a coherent medium .",
    "a natural question is whether there are other hydrodynamical properties that can be defined for this kind of solutions of the cqnlse . in this paper",
    "we analyse the drag , namely the force which opposes to the motion of an object within a surrounding fluid .",
    "an `` object '' inside the fluid described by a nlse can be modelled by implementing appropriate boundary conditions at the edge of the moving body , as was done in the framework of superfluidity in @xcite , where similar questions to those addressed here were studied .",
    "we will consider a different approach which might be suitable for nonlinear optics or becs : the probe object is also described by a cqnlse , leading to a bimodal system of coupled equations for two wave - functions @xmath5 , @xmath6 . in non - linear optics @xcite , the @xmath7 typically correspond to different polarizations or different carrier wavelengths while in becs they represent different atomic species in the condensate @xcite or different internal states of the same isotope @xcite , see _",

    "we will restrict ourselves to analysing @xmath11 , namely inter - modal repulsion resulting in a fluid with inmiscible phases , which is the most suitable situation to formulate thought experiments regarding drag forces .    a bimodal cubic - quintic model similar to ( [ eqs ] ) was first introduced in @xcite to discuss the interaction between solitons of both species . variations of this model were later used for the study of vector solitons @xcite , their dynamics @xcite and modulational instability @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out that these works mostly deal with intermodal attraction @xmath12 .",

    "we thus study the effects of the drag force exerted by the @xmath6-fluid on an @xmath5-probe `` object '' .    in section",
    "ii , we discuss the static solutions . in section iii , we find form - preserving traveling solutions which can be interpreted as dragless motion of an object within an inviscid fluid and are therefore related to dalembert s paradox .",

    "<S> we consider a system of two cubic - quintic non - linear schrdinger equations in two dimensions , coupled by repulsive cubic terms . </S>",
    "<S> we analyse situations in which a probe lump of one of the modes is surrounded by a fluid of the other one and analyse their interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we find a realization of dalembert s paradox for small velocities and non - trivial drag forces for larger ones . </S>",
    "<S> we present numerical analysis including the search of static and traveling form - preserving solutions along with simulations of the dynamical evolution in some representative examples . </S>"
