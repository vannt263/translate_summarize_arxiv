    "it is common in mathematics to regard two objects @xmath1 and @xmath2 as being the same if there is an isomorphism between them , that is a pair of maps @xmath3 and @xmath4 such that @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "more importantly , any specific isomorphism @xmath3 gives an explicit means for transporting information about @xmath1 to information about @xmath2 .",
    "the choice of ambient category plays a very important role in this process , especially when we examine two categories with the same objects but different morphisms . for example , first take the category of cw - complexes and continuous maps . in this category , an isomorphism between @xmath1 and @xmath2 gives a formula for transporting cell structures from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "if we now take the category of cw - complexes and homotopy classes of continuous maps , then isomorphisms are now homotopy equivalences .",
    "an isomorphism then no longer gives a recipe for transporting cell structures , but instead only gives a recipe for transporting homotopical information like homotopy and homology groups .",
    "an important property of an isomorphism @xmath3 is that it uniquely determines the inverse @xmath4 by the formulas @xmath5 and @xmath6 ; the proof is exactly the same as that showing that any group element has a unique inverse .",
    "thus we have two concepts which are _ a priori _ different :    * the property that @xmath3 is an isomorphism , and * the structure consisting of a pair @xmath7 of morphisms @xmath3 , @xmath4 such that @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we have then uncovered that a morphism @xmath8 has the property of being an isomorphism if and only if there is a pair @xmath7 with the isomorphism structure , and that moreover the pair @xmath7 is uniquely determined by @xmath8 alone .",
    "this is an example of a structure ( being part of an isomorphism pair ) that is determined in a unique way by a property ( the existence of an inverse ) .",
    "moving up to the case in which the objects of study are now the 0-cells of some 2-category ( or more generally , some bicategory ) , there are now more possible notions of sameness . while we can ask if two 0-cells of a 2-category are isomorphic , it is much more common to ask if they are equivalent .",
    "the canonical example of a 2-category is that of categories , functors , and natural transformations , and in this 2-category we see from experience that equivalence is the natural notion of sameness .",
    "a functor @xmath9 is often defined to be an equivalence if it is essentially surjective , full , and faithful .",
    "it is then shown that a functor @xmath10 is an equivalence if and only if there exists a functor @xmath11 such that the composites @xmath12 are naturally isomorphic to the identity functors @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "this definition identifies a property of a functor @xmath10 that allows us to conclude that two categories @xmath1 and @xmath2 are , in some sense , the same .    on the other hand",
    ", we can make the definition of the structure of adjoint equivalence @xmath14 which consists of a functor @xmath9 , a functor @xmath11 , and two natural isomorphisms @xmath15 such that the following two diagrams commute .",
    "@xmath16 it is clear that if @xmath14 is an adjoint equivalence , then @xmath10 is an equivalence .",
    "it is also well - known @xcite that every equivalence @xmath10 can be completed to an adjoint equivalence .",
    "now @xmath10 no longer determines @xmath17 uniquely , but instead only determines them up to a unique isomorphism preserving the adjoint equivalence structure .",
    "we refer the reader to the paper @xcite for a general discussion of this phenomenon in the setting of algebras for a 2-monad .",
    "the aim of this paper is to establish an analogous result in three - dimensional category theory .",
    "we define two different notions of sameness internal to a tricategory , one a property of a 1-cell and the other a structure involving 1- , 2- , and 3-cells satisfying certain axioms .",
    "these two notions are that of a 1-cell having the property `` is a biequivalence '' on the one hand , and the structure of a biadjoint biequivalence on the other hand .",
    "our main result is that , in any tricategory @xmath0 , every 1-cell which is a biequivalence is part of a biadjoint biequivalence .",
    "the proof of this result proceeds in three steps .",
    "first , we show that it is true for the special case when @xmath18 , the tricategory of bicategories , functors , pseudo - natural transformations , and modifications .",
    "second , we prove a result about transporting biadjoint biequivalences ; more precisely , we show that if a functor @xmath19 satisfies a kind of local embedding condition and @xmath0 has the property that every biequivalence is part of a biadjoint biequivalence , then @xmath20 has that property as well .",
    "finally , we prove that this property is inherited by functor tricategories from the target , so that if @xmath0 is a tricategory in which every biequivalence is part of a biadjoint biequivalence then the same holds for the functor tricategory @xmath21 for any @xmath20 .",
    "the main result then follows from these theorems and coherence for tricategories by considering the yoneda embedding .",
    "we also give two applications of this result .",
    "the first is a transport - of - structure result , showing how biequivalences @xmath9 between bicategories can be used to transport monoidal structures from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "this relies on choosing a weak inverse @xmath11 for the definition of the tensor product on @xmath2 , and then requires the rest of the biadjoint biequivalence structure in order to define the higher cells that are part of the definition of a monoidal bicategory and to check that they satisfy the necessary axioms .",
    "we also indicate how to prove similar results when the monoidal structure is replaced with a braided monoidal , sylleptic monoidal , or symmetric monoidal one .",
    "the second application of the main result is to an elucidation of those monoidal bicategories in which every object is weakly invertible , called picard 2-categories here .",
    "we show that every picard 2-category is monoidally biequivalent to one in which a coherent choice of inverses has been made .",
    "in fact , the result is much stronger in that we show that the forgetful functor from coherent picard 2-categories ( those with a choice of inverses ) to picard 2-categories ( those monoidal bicategories which merely have the property that every object is invertible ) is a triequivalence .",
    "we go on to improve this result by defining functors that preserve a given coherent structure up to equivalence , and show that every monoidal functor between picard 2-categories can be given the structure of such .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the first section is a warm - up in which we give a proof of the fact that every equivalence in a bicategory is part of an adjoint equivalence .",
    "we do this to give the reader a taste of the strategy that will be used later in the tricategorical case so as to clearly indicate the crucial points .",
    "this material is well - known although i am unaware of a reference that presents this result in full detail using the argument we give below .",
    "the second section gives the definitions of biequivalence and biadjoint biequivalence that are at the heart of this paper . both of these we express in the completely general case , working in an arbitrary tricategory @xmath0 .",
    "the definition of biadjoint biequivalence has two forms , with and without the `` horizontal cusp '' axioms , and we discuss briefly why these two definitions are logically equivalent using the calculus of mates .",
    "section 3 gives a proof of our main result in the special case where @xmath22 .",
    "this proof is largely calculation , much as the proof that every equivalence in @xmath23 is part of an adjoint equivalence is done by straightforward calculation in section 1 .",
    "we use that a biequivalence in @xmath24 can be characterized in two different ways : as a functor having a weak inverse or as a functor which is biessentially surjective and a local equivalence .",
    "the proof largely consists of using this alternate characterization of biequivalences , results from section 1 , and the biadjoint biequivalence axioms to construct the other cells of the biadjoint biequivalence .",
    "this is done by constructing the components on objects first , and then building up the rest of the structure afterwords .",
    "the reader will note that the technical difficulties lie in two places : in constructing these cells once the components on objects are given , and in checking that our constructions satisfy all of the biadjoint biequivalence axioms since we only need a subset of them in order to define all the needed cells .",
    "the fourth section provides the proof of our main result , that every biequivalence in a tricategory is part of a biadjoint biequivalence . the proofs in this section",
    "rely very heavily on coherence for tricategories in the form `` every diagram in a free tricategory commutes '' to simplify the pasting diagrams required .",
    "we often leave the particulars of checking axioms to the reader as the diagrams are very large , but we state exactly which axioms are needed in each case .",
    "the bulk of the technical work goes into showing that the components we construct satisfy the axioms required to be transformations , modifications , or perturbations , while the biadjoint biequivalence axioms are immediate .",
    "sections 5 and 6 give the two applications mentioned above .",
    "both of these results should be thought of in the form `` a certain 3-dimensional monad has property p '' in each case . in the case of lifting monoidal structures , the monad would be the free monoidal bicategory monad on the tricategory @xmath24 , and the property p would be a 3-dimensional version of flexibility @xcite . in the case of picard 2-categories , the monad would be the free picard 2-category monad on the tricategory of monoidal bicategories , and the property p would be a kind of 3-dimensional idempotency @xcite .",
    "this is the proper way to view these results , although we do not pursue the details here because of the lack of groundwork on 3-dimensional monads on tricategories .",
    "the author would like to thank bruce bartlett for his interest in these results , and john baez and eugenia cheng for enlightening discussions .",
    "we begin by reviewing the relevant results for bicategories that we will later generalize to tricategories .",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with bicategories and the coherence theorem for bicategories ( see @xcite for coherence for bicategories , or @xcite for a discussion of coherence , including functors , for the case of monoidal categories instead of bicategories ) .",
    "we begin with some basic definitions .",
    "let @xmath25 be a bicategory , and let @xmath26 and @xmath27 be 1-cells in @xmath25 .",
    "an _ adjunction _",
    "@xmath28 consists of a 2-cell @xmath29 and a 2-cell @xmath30 such that the following two diagrams ( the triangle identities ) commute .",
    "@xmath31^{l_{g}^{-1 } } \\ar[rrrrd]_{1_{g } } & 1_{x}g \\ar[r]^{\\eta * 1_{g } } & ( gf)g \\ar[r]^{a } & g(fg ) \\ar[r]^{1_{g}*\\varepsilon } & g1_{y } \\ar[d]^{r } \\\\ & & & & g}\\ ] ] @xmath32^{r_{f}^{-1 } } \\ar[rrrrd]_{1_{f } } & f 1_{x } \\ar[r]^{1_{f}*\\eta } & f(gf ) \\ar[r]^{a^{-1 } } & ( fg)f \\ar[r]^{\\varepsilon * 1_{f } } & 1_{y}f \\ar[d]^{l } \\\\ & & & & f}\\ ] ] we then say that @xmath8 is left adjoint to @xmath33 , or that @xmath33 is right adjoint to @xmath8 .    in the bicategory @xmath34",
    ", the associativity and unit isomorphisms are all identities . in that case",
    ", this definition reduces to the usual definition of an adjunction between functors .",
    "an adjunction @xmath35 is an _ adjoint equivalence _ if @xmath36 and @xmath37 are invertible . in this case , we write @xmath38 .    [ cat ] let @xmath39 and @xmath11 be functors , and let @xmath40 and @xmath41 be natural isomorphisms .",
    "then there is a unique adjoint equivalence @xmath42 in @xmath34 such that @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath43 .",
    "the second triangle identity states that @xmath44 . by the invertibility of @xmath36 ,",
    "this equation is the same as @xmath45 .",
    "the righthand side of this equation is well - defined and @xmath10 is full and faithful since it is an equivalence of categories , so we define @xmath46 to be the unique arrow such that @xmath47 .",
    "we must now check that @xmath37 is natural and that the first triangle identity holds . for naturality",
    ", we consider the square below .",
    "@xmath48^{f } \\ar[d]_{\\eta_{x } } & y \\ar[d]^{\\eta_{y } } \\\\ gfx \\ar[r]_{gff } & gfy } \\ ] ] applying @xmath10 to the diagram and using functoriality gives this square .",
    "@xmath49^{ff } \\ar[d]_{f\\eta_{x } } & fy \\ar[d]^{f\\eta_{y } } \\\\ fgfx \\ar[r]_{fgff } & fgfy } \\ ] ] by the definition of @xmath37 , this square is the naturality square of @xmath50 and thus must commute . by the faithfulness of @xmath10 , the original square commutes as well and so @xmath37 is natural .",
    "for the first triangle identity , we consider the composite @xmath51^{\\eta_{gy } } & gfgy \\ar[r]^{g\\varepsilon_{y } } & gy . } \\ ] ] applying @xmath10 to this yields @xmath52 , which is by definition @xmath53 . now",
    "the following square commutes by the naturality of @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath54^{\\varepsilon_{fgy } } \\ar[d]_{fg \\varepsilon_{y } } & fgy \\ar[d]^{\\varepsilon_{y } } \\\\ fgy \\ar[r]_{\\varepsilon_{y } } & y } \\ ] ] by the invertibility of @xmath55 , we get that @xmath56 .",
    "therefore @xmath57 . once again by the faithfulness of @xmath10 , @xmath58 and",
    "thus the first triangle identity is satisfied .",
    "[ remcat ] we could have just as easily constructed an adjoint equivalence with @xmath59 instead of @xmath43 .",
    "in general it is not possible to require both of these conditions , though , as the choice of either @xmath37 or @xmath60 fixes the other",
    ".    it would be possible at this point to prove , by a series of calculations , an analogous result with @xmath61 replaced by any bicategory , but instead we choose a different approach that generalizes more easily to the case of tricategories .",
    "let @xmath25 be a bicategory , and let @xmath62 be a 1-cell in @xmath25 . then @xmath8 is an _ equivalence _ if there exists a @xmath63 such that @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",

    ", we remind the reader that , for 3-cells in a tricategory , @xmath206 denotes the composition along 2-cell boundaries , @xmath207 denotes composition along 1-cell boundaries , and @xmath208 denotes composition along 0-cell boundaries .",
    "now the second axiom determines the 3-cell @xmath209 .",
    "since the 2-cell @xmath87 is an equivalence , the functor @xmath210 is an equivalence of categories , and in particular the cell @xmath209 uniquely determines the cell @xmath211 .",
    "similarly , since the functor @xmath10 is a biequivalence , @xmath148 is also , so the functor @xmath212 is a biequivalence of bicategories ; thus @xmath213 uniquely determines the invertible modification @xmath137 . by construction ,",

    "the composite @xmath215 equals the composite @xmath216 , and similarly @xmath217 , but we still have associativity and unit equivalences for this composition law .",
    "these are the 1-cells in the biadjoint biequivalence axioms labeled @xmath218 , and they have components on objects given by identites and components on morphisms given by unique coherence 2-cells . for examples ,",
    "the transformation @xmath219 has its component at an object @xmath72 the identity @xmath220 and its component at a 1-cell @xmath62 the unique coherence cell @xmath221 similarly , the modifications @xmath222 and @xmath223 in @xmath138 all have unique coherence 2-cells as their components .",

    "@xmath458    second , we could have asked that the invertible 2-cells @xmath453 could have been the components of a pair of invertible modifications . to express the axioms above as diagrams of modifications would have required that the @xmath459 be the components of transformations , which in turn would require that the functor @xmath410 be covariant instead of contravariant .",
    "thus we would have to restrict attention to those picard 2-categories in which every 1-cell is an equivalence ; in fact , we would need every 1-cell to come as part of a specified adjoint equivalence in order to prescribe @xmath410 as a covariant _",
    "functor_.    third , we could have required a third axiom about how @xmath460 interact with @xmath137 .",
    "this axiom follows from the first axiom by using the biadjoint biequivalence axioms .",
    "in addition , the pastings involved are larger than the one for the axiom above as they involve two different uses of @xmath143 instead of just one , so it requires additional naturality squares .",
    "the 1-cell @xmath463 is given by the following composite where the last arrow is given by a composite of coherence cells and is thus unique up to unique isomorphism by coherence for functors .",
    "@xmath464 it is immediate that @xmath457 is an equivalence 1-cell .",
    "we must now construct the invertible 2-cells @xmath453 and check the two axioms .",
    "the cell @xmath465 is a pasting of coherence cells from both @xmath2 and the functor @xmath10 , together with @xmath466 .",
    "the cell @xmath467 is constructed similarly out of coherence cells and @xmath468 .",
    "the two axioms are straightforward diagram chases .",
    "let @xmath1 be a picard 2-category .",
    "then @xmath1 has a coherent structure which is unique in the following sense : if @xmath386 and @xmath469 are two coherent structures on @xmath1 , then the identity functor on @xmath1 lifts to a coherent functor @xmath470    we leave it to the reader to define coherent transformations and modifications .",
    "a coherent transformation will involve additional data , while a coherent modification will only involve a new axiom .",
    "defined correctly , it is then possible to prove that the forgetful functor from the tricategory in which all cells are coherent to the tricategory @xmath380 is a triequivalence .",
    "this shows that a coherent structure on a given picard 2-category is unique in the strongest possible sense ."
