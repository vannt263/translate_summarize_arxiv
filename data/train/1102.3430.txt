    "to understand the cosmic history of star formation and agn ( active galactic nuclei ) , it is vital to understand infrared ( ir ) emission ; the more intense star formation , the more deeply it is embedded in the dust , hence , such star formation is not visible in uv but in the infrared .",
    "similarly , agn evolutionary scenarios predict that agn are heavily obscured at their youngest , compton - thick stage @xcite . the spitzer and akari satellites revealed a great deal of infrared emission in the high - redshift universe , showing strong evolution in the infrared luminosity density .",
    "for example , at z=1 , @xcite estimated 90% of star formation activity is hidden by dust .",
    "however , to investigate evolution of ir lf , these high - redshift studies need a good comparison sample at z=0 . even today , the often used is the iras lfs @xcite from 1980s , with only several hundred galaxies .",
    "in addition , for more than 25 years , bolometric infrared luminosities ( @xmath26 ) of local galaxies have been estimated using equation in @xcite , which is a simple polynomial , obtained assuming a simple blackbody and dust emissivity .",
    "furthermore , the reddest filter of iras is 100@xmath0 , which does not span the peak of the dust emission for most galaxies , leaving a great deal of uncertainty . a number of studies found cold dust that can not be detected with the iras .",
    "for example , @xcite detected such cold dust with @xmath27k using scuba 450,850 @xmath28 m flux .",
    "@xcite detected cold galaxies with sed peaks at longer wavelengths using spitzer / mips .",
    "these results cast further doubt on @xmath2 estimated using only @xmath29 m photometry .",
    "more precise estimate of local @xmath2 and thus the local ir luminosity function ( lf ) have been long awaited , to be better compared with high redshift work and to understand where the end - point of the cosmic ir density evolution is .",
    "akari , the japanese infrared satellite @xcite , provides the first chance to rectify the situation since iras ; akari performed an all - sky survey in two mid - infrared bands ( centered on 9 and 18 @xmath0 ) and in four far - infrared bands ( 65,90 , 140 , and 160@xmath0 ) .",
    "its 140 and 160@xmath0 sensitivities are especially important to cover across the peak of the dust emission , allowing us to accurately measure the rayleigh - jeans tail of the ir emission . using deeper data and modern models , in this work",
    ", we aim to measure local @xmath2 , and thereby the ir lf . by matching the akari ir sources with the sdss galaxies",
    ", our sample contains @xmath302357 ir galaxies .",
    "compared to the previous work @xcite , the sample is several times larger , allowing us to accurately measure ir lf of the local universe .",
    "the optical spectra of the sdss also allows us to separate ir emission from agn and star - forming galaxies .",
    "this work provides us an important local benchmark to base our evolution studies at high redshift both by the current akari , spitzer , and herschel satellites , and by next - generation ir satellites such as wise , jwst , and spica .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt a cosmology with @xmath31 .",
    "akari @xcite performed an all - sky survey in two mid - infrared bands ( centered on 9 and 18 @xmath0 ) and in four far - infrared bands ( 65,90,140 , and 160@xmath0 ) . in this work ,",
    "we use the version 1 of the akari / irc point source catalog and the akari / fis bright source catalog , which is selected in 90@xmath28 m .",
    "the 5 @xmath32 sensitivities in the akari ir filters ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) are 0.05 , 0.09 , 2.4 , 0.55 , 1.4 , and 6.3 jy @xcite .",
    "in addition to the much improved sensitivity and spatial resolution over its precursor ( the iras all - sky survey ) , the presence of 140 and 160@xmath0 bands is crucial to measure the peak of the dust emission in the fir wavelength , and thus the @xmath2 of galaxies .    to measure @xmath2",
    ", we need spectroscopic redshift of individual galaxies .",
    "we have cross - correlated the akari fis bright source catalog with the sdss dr7 galaxy catalog @xcite , which is the largerst redshift survey in the local universe to date .",
    "we used a matching radius of 20 arcsec , as shown in fig.[fig : sep ] .",
    "this radius is determined based mainly on the positional accuracy of the akari fir sources since for the sdss , positional accuracy is less than 0.1  to the survey limit ( @xmath3522 * ? ? ?",
    "akari s psf size in the 90@xmath28 m filter is 39@xmath171  .",
    "the astrometric accuracy of the akari fis bright source catalog is 3.8  in cross - scan direction and 4.8  in in - scan direction @xcite .",
    "the 20  radius also accounts for the physiscal shift that could be present between the peaks of the fir and the optical emission . at the median redshift of z=0.031",
    ", 20  corresponds to 12 kpc .",
    "the source density of the sdss main spectroscopic galaxies is 92 deg@xmath36 @xcite .",
    "therefore , within the 20  around each akari sources , 0.009 of background galaxies are expected to be present , i.e. , less than 1% of our sources are expected to be a chance coincidence , which should not affect our estimate of the lfs .",
    "see @xcite for a maximum likelihood approach to this .",
    "we do not use galaxies at @xmath37 since ( i ) at such a low velocity , uncertainty from peculiar velocity is too large to estimate distance from spectroscopic redshift , and ( ii ) the akari s photometry of largely extended objects is not finalized yet . we also remove galaxies at @xmath38 to avoid too much evolutionary effect within the redshift range .",
    "we also use sdss galaxies with extinction corrected @xmath39 , where the sdss main galaxy spectroscopic target selection can be considered complete . to obtain reliable lfs",
    ", we only use akari sources with @xmath40 , where completeness is greater than 80% . among these",
    ", 99% of sources have high quality flag of fqual=3 in @xmath41 .",
    "67% of akari sources with @xmath40 in the area covered by the sdss had an optical counterpart .",
    "the rest of the sources are either stars or galaxies fainter than @xmath42 , which are property accounted for the lf computation in section [ sec : vmax ] .",
    "previous sample of local ir lfs was based on iras @xmath43 flux , and thus , it has been a concern that colder galaxies , whose fir emission peak at larger wavelengths , might have been missed in the sample .",
    "our sample is selected using @xmath44 flux , and thus , more robust to such a selection bias .",
    "we found cross - matches of 2357 galaxies , with which we will measure ir lfs . among these , 97 , 98 , and 87% of sources",
    "have measured flux in 65 , 140 and 160@xmath28 m . for these source",
    "the akari irc catalog is also cross - matched .",
    "only 0.8% of fis - sdss sources do not have an irc counterpart within 20 arcsec .",
    "fig.[fig : zhist ] shows a redshift distribution of the sample .",
    "the number of galaxies used are similar to the iras based work by @xcite , despite the twice increase in the optical ( sdss ) sample .",
    "this is due to more stringent cross - matching criterion we used .",
    "akari s improved astrometry allowed us to remove ambiguous cross - ids .",
    "nevertheless , thanks to the large sky coverage of the sdss and akari surveys , this is one of the largest number of galaxies used to construct ir lfs .",
    "for example , previous local ir lfs are based on @xmath30600 galaxies @xcite .       measured by the akari as a function of spectroscopic redshift .",
    "]    for these galaxies , we estimated total ir luminosities ( @xmath2 ) by fitting the akari photometry with sed templates .",
    "we used the lephare codearnouts / lephare.html ] to fit the infrared part ( @xmath457@xmath28 m ) of the sed .",
    "we fit our akari fir photometry with the sed templates from ( chel hereafter * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which showed most promising results among sed models tested by @xcite .",
    "it is a concern that the chel models do not include seds for agn .",
    "however , we show later in section 2.3 that this is not a major problem using observed data .",
    "we did not include iras photometry in the sed fit partly because the better spatial resolution of akari often resolves background cirrus and nearby companion better @xcite , and partly because not all of the akari sources are detected with the iras due to the difference in flux limits .",
    "although the shape of these seds are luminosity - dependent , the large baseline from akari observations ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) allows us to adopt a free scaling to obtain the best sed fit , which is then rescaled to derive @xmath2 . to be precise , we only used @xmath46 m flux to free scale the seds since mid - ir bands can sometimes be affected by the stellar emission . for those sources with low quality flag ( fqual=1 ) , we adopted a minimum error of 25% . in this work",

    "one has to be careful that two different physical mechanisms contribute to total infrared emission of galaxies : one by star - formation and the other by agn .",
    "it is therefore fundamental to separate ir contribution from these two different physics , to understand the evolution of the star - formation and agn activity .",
    "however , this has been notoriously difficult and has been a subject of active debate over the last decades .",
    "many agn / sf separation methods have been proposed such as x - ray , radio luminosity , optical line ratios , pah strengths , submm properties and so on @xcite . often , not all of the indicators do not agree one another , partly due to complicated nature of ir sources ( multiple core , composite ... etc ) .",

    "as expected , the broad - line agn are scattered everywhere in the figure and escapes from the above criteria . therefore , we manually overruled the classification of these broad - line agn , and treated them as agn in the rest of the paper , regardless of the line ratios in fig.[fig : bpt ] . in this process",

    "our @xmath2 of agn include ir emission from an agn host galaxy .",
    "the latter might be dominant in fir wavelength . those galaxies with line ratios consistent to be liners are treated as agn in this paper , but their emission may have nothing to do with an accreting black hole , instead may be from shocks or something else .",
    "therefore , it is possible that these classified as agn in this paper still have significant infrared emission from host galaxies , instead of central black holes . to make the matter worse ,",
    "it is additional unknown how many completely obscured galaxies we miss in our optical classification for both agn and sfg .",
    "while this work had only optical line ratios for classification , the final conclusion must be based on multi - wavelength data .",
    "with accurately measured @xmath2 , we are ready to construct ir lfs . since our sample is flux - limited at @xmath61 and @xmath62 , we need to correct for a volume effect to compute lfs .",

    "an advantage of the 1/@xmath60 method is that it allows us to compute a lf directly from data , with no parameter dependence or a model assumption .",

    "we adoped a redshift where galaxies become fainter than eithter @xmath66- of @xmath44-flux limit as @xmath65 .    for each luminosity bin",
    "then , the lf is derived as @xmath67 , where @xmath60 is a comoving volume over which the @xmath68th galaxy could be observed , and @xmath69 is the size of the luminosity bin , and @xmath70 the completeness correction factor of the @xmath68th galaxy .",
    "note that the @xmath60 method considers both the optical and ir flux limits .",
    "therefore , even an ir source with @xmath71 , a detectable volume of such sources is properly considered by the @xmath60 method as long as ir sources with the same optical - to - ir ratio can be detected at a lower redshift .",
    "see appendix of @xcite and @xcite for more details of a multivariate @xmath60 method .",
    "a very obscured ir galaxy ( with @xmath71 even at the lowest redshift of z=0.01 ) , however , would have a detectable volume of zero , and thus , would not be included in the lf computation .",
    "the number density of such obscured ir galaxies is a matter of interest itself , but requires deeper optical data .",

    "uncertainties in the lf values stem from various factors such as the finite numbers of sources in each luminosity bin , the k - correction uncertainties , and the flux errors .",
    "to compute these errors we performed monte carlo simulations by creating 150 simulated catalogs , where each catalog contains the same number of sources , but we assign each source new fluxes following a gaussian distribution centered at fluxes with a width of a measured error . then we measured errors of each bin of the lf based from the variation in the 150 simulations .",

    ", the most notable difference is at the bright- and faint - end slopes , where the agn and sfg lfs dominate , respectively .",
    "the @xmath23 of agn is slightly brighter than that of sfg .",
    "one of the pioneers in ir agn lf is @xcite , who selected 893 ir galaxies ( of which 118 are agn ) from iras 12@xmath28 m to minimize wavelength - dependent selection biases towards bluer seyfert 1 nuclei and redder embedded agn @xcite . despite small differences such as selection , agn classification , and @xmath2 based on the iras , their total ir lf of agn in their fig.9 is in very good agreement with ours , showing the same agn dominance at larger @xmath2 .",
    "what do these differences in lfs bring to the ir luminosity density , @xmath3 , by agn and sfg ? we estimate the total infrared luminosity density by integrating the lfs weighted by the luminosity , separately for agn and sfg .",
    "we used the double power law outside the luminosity range in which we have data , to obtain estimates of the total infrared luminosity density , @xmath3 , for agn and sfg .",
    "the resulting total luminosity density ( @xmath3 ) is , @xmath25=5.9@xmath82 @xmath5mpc@xmath6 , and @xmath24=1.9@xmath83 @xmath5mpc@xmath6 , as summarized in table [ tab : fit_parameters ] .",
    "errors are estimated by varying the fit within 1@xmath32 of uncertainty in lfs .",
    "the results show that among the total ir luminosity density integrated over all the ir luminosity range , 75% ( @xmath84 ) of ir luminosity density is emitted by the sfg , and only 24% ( @xmath85 ) is by agn at z=0.031 .",
    "the agn contribution is larger than z=0.0081 , however , is still small compared with higher redshift results .",
    "once we have @xmath25 , we can estimate star formation density emitted in infrared light .",
    "the sfr and @xmath2 is related by the following equation for a salpeter imf , @xmath86 ( m ) @xmath87 between @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath89 = 1.72 \\times 10^{-10 } l_{ir } [ l_{\\odot } ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by using this equation , we obtain sfr density = 1.3@xmath170.2 @xmath90 .",
    "if we limit our integration to ulirg luminosity range ( @xmath18 ) , we obtain , @xmath25(ulirg)= 1.4@xmath91 @xmath5mpc@xmath6 , and @xmath24(ulirg)= 2.5@xmath92 @xmath5mpc@xmath6 . in other words , at ulirg luminosity range , agn explain 64% ( @xmath93 ) of ir luminosity , again showing the agn dominance at the bright - end .",
    "note that @xmath24(ulirg ) larger than @xmath94(ulirg ) is apparently inconsistent .",
    "this is due to the limitation in extrapolating the double - power law to obtain @xmath3 .",
    "for example , the agn lf has a flatter bright - end slope of beta=3.1@xmath170.2 than beta of 3.54@xmath170.09 for total lf .",
    "once extrapolated to larger luminosity at @xmath9512.5 , the flatter slope could produce larger @xmath3 once integrated even if all the observed data points for agn are below those of total ir . to obtain more accurate estimate of @xmath3",
    "we clearly need data points in larger luminosity range than the akari observed . in this paper",
    ", we tried to obtain best - estimates of each @xmath3 for agn , sfg , and total . as a result , we caution readers that @xmath94 is not necessarily the algebraical sum of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .    in the lirg luminosity ( @xmath14 ) , results are @xmath25(lirg)= 2.1@xmath96 @xmath5mpc@xmath6 , and @xmath24(lirg)= 1.9@xmath97 @xmath5mpc@xmath6 .",
    "this shows agn contribution is already down to 47% ( @xmath98 ) of ir luminosity in the lirg range .",
    "we have separated the @xmath25 from @xmath24 .",
    "now we are ready to examine the evolution of @xmath99 without contribution from agn . in fig.[fig : tld_all ] , we plot the evolution of @xmath100 as a function of redshift .",
    "higher redshift results are taken from @xcite , who also tried to exclude agn using sed fitting .",
    "results from the spitzer survey and galex survey are also plotted .",
    "the @xmath25 shows a strong evolution as a function of redshift .",
    "the best - fit linear relation is @xmath19(1+z)@xmath20 .",
    "we have removed @xmath2 of optically - classified agn in this analysis . a caveat in this process , however , is that @xmath2 of optically - selected agn perhaps includes some ir emission from star - formation in agn host galaxies . in this sense ,",
    "@xmath25 estimated here is a lower - limit .",
    "however , this should not affect @xmath25 more than 30% since the @xmath24 is smaller than @xmath25 by a factor of 3 as we show in the next section .    in comparison ,",
    "our results are in good agreement with previous works shown in the dash - dotted lines in fig.[fig : tld_all ] . in the form of @xmath101 ( 1+z)@xmath102 ,",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath103 , @xcite obtained @xmath104 , @xcite obtained @xmath105 , obtained @xmath106 .    once the ir luminosity density is separated into ulirg and lirg contribution",
    ", we found @xmath107(1+z)@xmath108 , and @xmath109(1+z)@xmath110 .",
    "@xmath111 shows more rapid evolution than @xmath112 , showing importance of luminous ir sources at high redshift .          in turn",
    ", we can also investigate @xmath24 . by integrating ir lf@xmath113 in fig.[fig : agn_lf ] , we obtained @xmath24=(1.9@xmath114 @xmath5mpc@xmath6 .    in fig.[fig : tld_agn_all ] , we show the evolution of @xmath24 , which shows a strong evolution with increasing redshift . at a first glance ,",
    "both @xmath24 and @xmath25 show rapid evolution , suggesting that the correlation between star formation and black hole accretion rate continues to hold at higher redshifts , i.e. , galaxies and black holes seem to be evolving hand in hand .",
    "when we fit the evolution with ( 1+z)@xmath102 , we found @xmath21(1+z)@xmath22 .",
    "a caveat , however , is that @xmath24 estimated in this work likely to include ir emission from host galaxies of agn , although in optical the agn component dominates .",
    "therefore , the final conclusion must be drawn from a multi - component fit based on better sampling in fir by herschel or spica , to separate agn / sfg contribution to @xmath2 .",
    "the contribution by ulirgs quickly increases toward higher redshift ; by z=1.5 , it exceeds that from lirgs .",
    "indeed , we found @xmath115(1+z)@xmath116 and @xmath117(1+z)@xmath118 .",
    "we have cross - correlated the akari ir all sky survey with the sdss to find 2357 ir galaxies with optical spectra .",
    "using akari s 6-band ir photometry in 9 , 18 , 65 , 90 , 140 , and 160@xmath0 , we have measured @xmath2 via sed model fitting .",
    "the akari s 6 bands cover the crucial far - ir wavelengths across the peak of the dust emission , providing us with more accurate @xmath2 measurements than iras . by separating sfg / agn using optical line ratios , we constructed local ir lfs separately for sfg and agn .",
    "we also computed local infrared luminosity density through the derived lfs , and compared @xmath25 and @xmath24 to those at higher redshifts .",
    "our findings are as follows .    *",
    "the local ir lf with the akari data at the median redshift of z=0.031 agrees well with that at z=0.0081 , and shows smooth and continuous evolution toward higher redshift results from the akari nep deep field .",
    "* by integrating the ir lf weighted by @xmath2 , we obtain the local cosmic ir luminosity density of @xmath3= ( 3.8@xmath4 @xmath5mpc@xmath6 . *",
    "the fraction of agn and composite galaxies show continuous incrase from 25% to 90% at @xmath11912.5 . *",
    "the sfr based on self - absorption , and extinction corrected @xmath52 correlates with @xmath2 for sfgs .",

    "* lirg and ulirg contribute to @xmath3 a little ; only 1.1@xmath16% of @xmath3 is produced by lirg ( @xmath14 ) , and only 0.03@xmath170.01% is by ulirg ( @xmath18 ) in the local universe . *",
