    "the radiation from a black hole known as the hawking radiation has a thermal spectrum @xcite . in the case of a schwarzschild black hole ,",
    "its temperature , namely , the hawking temperature is inversely proportional to mass of the black hole .",
    "the black hole is losing its mass by the hawking radiation and it is increasing its hawking temperature . at the final stage of the radiation ,",
    "its temperature and its intensity explosively increase , therefore the final stage of the black hole is very interesting to particle physicists @xcite .",
    "several authors discussed that the heating - up by the hawking radiation can thermalize the neighborhood of the black hole and thermal phase transition around the black hole can arise .",
    "the qcd phase transition @xcite and the electroweak ( ew ) phase transition @xcite have been discussed .",
    "the local phase - transition around the black hole means the formation of the spherical domain wall which separates region of the symmetric - phase and that of the broken - phase .",
    "the baryon number production and the electroweak baryogenesis scenario have been proposed as an application of the spherical wall @xcite .",
    "the hawking temperature should be much greater than the critical temperature of the phase transition to consider the formation of the wall with the thermal phase transition .",
    "the mean free paths for the radiated particles are much longer than the schwarzschild radius and we should confirm the local thermal equilibrium around the black hole to consider the thermal phase transition . therefore the hawking temperature should be much higher than the critical temperature to guarantee the local thermal equilibrium with the critical temperature .",
    "however , it is natural to ask if the hawking radiation whose temperature is equal to or greater than the critical temperature influences the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) locally .    in this paper , we discuss a hawking radiation in the gauge - higgs - yukawa systems , e.g. , the standard model ( sm ) and the grand unified theory ( gut ) , and we show that a structure of the spherical domain wall around the black hole arises by the field dynamics of the system .",
    "it seems that we need to consider the full dynamics of the field theory to discuss the phenomenon around the black hole and it will be technically difficult , however , only a part of interaction is relevant to the subject because the mean free paths for the gauge interaction is much longer than the radius of the black hole and it simplifies the analysis .",
    "the relevants are interactions between the hawking - radiated particles and the higgs vev .",
    "the radiated particles can be regard as ballistic because of their long mean - free - paths . by founding on these properties ,",
    "we propose a effective model with a _",
    "ballistic approximation_. our model consists from the action for the higgs field and that for the relativistic point particles radiated from the black hole .",
    "we derive an effective action for the higgs field which determines the structure of the higgs vev around the black hole . by considering the effective action ,",
    "the formation of the spherical domain wall around the black hole is shown when the hawking temperature is equal or greater than the energy scale of the higgs - yukawa system .",
    "we will call this mechanism the _ dynamical formation of the spherical wall _ in distinction from the thermal formation of the spherical wall . as realistic cases ,",
    "the formation of the ew wall and that of the gut wall are discussed .",
    "we also discuss a mechanism of the _ spontaneous charging - up of the black hole _ as one of applications of the spherical wall .",
    "we assume the following two conditions : ( i ) a cp - broken phase in the spherical wall and ( ii ) a chiral charge assignment of fermions in the field theory , namely , a c - violation of the theory .",
    "the hawking radiation is neutral for the charge , however the spherical wall has a reflection - asymmetry for the charge on the assumptions .",
    "therefore a charge - transport - mechanism from the wall to the black hole works and it charges - up the black hole .",
    "this mechanism is a variant application of the charge transport scenario in the electroweak baryogenesis model proposed by cohen , kaplan and nelson @xcite .",
    "the two assumptions are equivalent to two of the sakharov s three conditions for the baryogenesis @xcite . in the case of the black hole",
    "whose hawking temperature is ew scale , the black hole can obtain a large amount of the hyper charge .",
    "the black hole with gut temperature can also obtain several charge .",
    "the paper is organized as follows ; in section [ formation.sec ] , the formation mechanism of the spherical wall is discussed . in section [ chargeup.sec ] , a mechanism for the spontaneous",
    "charging - up of the black hole is discussed . in section [ summary.sec ]",
    "we provide a conclusion and discussions .",
    "we will consider a hawking radiation in the gauge - higgs - yukawa system like the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "especially , we will discuss dynamics of the higgs field around the black hole whose hawking temperature is the same energy scale of the system , e.g. , the critical temperature . in the situation , the mean free paths from the gauge interactions are much greater than the length scale for the black hole @xcite , therefore , most of the gauge interactions are not important .",
    "the relevants are the yukawa interactions for the heavy fermions and the gauge interactions between the higgs and heavy gauge bosons .",
    "these particles obtain their heavy mass from the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) through the interactions .",
    "inversely we can expect that the particles radiated from the black hole with high energy and with high density deform the higgs vev around the black hole .",
    "it seems that we need full calculation for the field dynamics to consider the deformation of the higgs vev exactly .",
    "however we can employ the _ ballistic approximation _ for the radiated particles because the mean free paths are enough long and the only yukawa - type interactions are relevant .",
    "namely , the deformation of the higgs vev can be discussed by the relativistic semi - classical kinematics of the each radiated ballistic particles through the relevant interactions .",
    "the approximated system should have lorentz invariance and any ballistic particles obtain their mass by the higgs vev . to discuss the deformation in the ballistic approximation",

    "we have ignored the backreaction from the produced wall into the distribution of the particles , namely , we have ignored the contribution from the non - uniform configuration of the higgs field which is depending on the distance from the black hole .",
    "we note that the ignored contribution to the particle trajectories can be evaluated by solving the equation @xmath38 derived from equation ( [ econst ] ) and it will be a future subject .    by substituting the equation ( [ distribution ] ) into the equation ( [ mueff ] ) , we obtain @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a constant depending on the field theory and we have defined the effective @xmath41 as @xmath42 here we find that the sign of @xmath43 is reversed at @xmath44 , namely , @xmath43 is negative for @xmath45 and @xmath43 is positive for @xmath46 .",

    "the same analysis results @xmath77 then the spherical gut wall around the black hole is also formed when the hawking temperature is greater than the gut scale .",
    "finally we can discuss that the dynamical spherical wall around a black hole may be formed in most of the field theory which has a higgs mechanism when the hawking temperature is greater than the energy scale of the field theory .",
    "we will discuss that the hawking radiation can charge up the black hole by the effect of the spherical domain wall which has been discussed .",
    "we need two assumptions such that ( i ) the domain wall has cp - broken phase and ( ii ) the field theory has fermions with chiral charge assignment .",
    "the standard model satisfies the second assumptions because the left - handed quark and the right - handed quark have different hyper charges . when the first assumption is satisfied , the reflection rate on the wall of the left - handed fermions is different from that of the right - handed fermions .",
    "therefore the domain wall has a charge - reflection - asymmetry when both assumptions are satisfied .",
    "the hawking radiation is charge - neutral , however , the black hole obtains net charge by the effect of the domain wall because a part of the reflected particles return into the black hole , namely the net charge is transported to the black hole .",
    "this process is similar to the `` charge transport mechanism / scenario by the thin wall '' in the electroweak baryogenesis proposed by cohen , kaplan and nelson @xcite . in the charge transport scenario of the electroweak baryogenesis",

    "the charge flux at the wall is given by @xmath90 the summation in the equation is taking over all species of the chiral - charged fermions and the particle - species @xmath27 does not distinguish both the chirality of the particle and the particle / anti - particle .",

    "we have assumed @xmath108 for simplicity . [ dr.eps ] ]    the black hole with the hawking temperature @xmath37 has a finite lifetime @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the total degree of freedom with a fermion correction .",
    "the total charge transported to the black hole in his lifetime by the effect of the wall is @xmath113 where we have assumed the maximum focusing effect .",

    "an action for the many relativistic point particles ( nambu - goto like action ) with higgs coupling and the ordinary higgs action with double well potential are adopted to describe the system .",
    "we expect that the system approximately describes the higgs - yukawa system which is consist from the ordinary dirac action and the bosonic actions .",

    "the charge loss of the black hole has been discussed .",
    "gibbons first proposed this subject by the semi - classical method @xcite and gabriel discussed that this result can be confirmed recently by the functional method @xcite .",
    "they discussed that the charged black hole loses its charge by the pair creation of the charged particles because of the strong electric field around the black hole , namely , a kind of schwinger process works to discharge the black hole .",
    "these calculation are reliable only for @xmath131 where @xmath132 is mass of electron , namely the radius of the black hole should be greater than the compton wave length of the electron .",

    "<S> the formation of the electroweak wall and that of the gut wall are shown as realistic cases . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss a phenomenon of the spontaneous charging - up of the black hole . </S>",
    "<S> the hawking radiation can charge - up the black hole itself by the charge - transportation due to the spherical wall when c- and cp - violation in the wall are assumed . </S>",
    "<S> the black hole with the electroweak wall can obtain a large amount of the hyper charge .    </S>",
