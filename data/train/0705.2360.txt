    "qcd  @xcite is considered to be a well - established theory for the strong interaction . in the high energy regime",
    ", we can use a perturbative approach to understand the theory .",
    "however , at low energy , because of the large coupling constant , perturbation theory is not applicable . in the low energy regime",
    "we can appeal to other methods of analysis , for instance chiral perturbation theory and lattice qcd .",
    "conjectured by maldacena @xcite in 1997 , the ads / cft correspondence is a new approach to this difficult problem .",
    "this conjecture states that a string theory on @xmath0 is equivalent to a conformal theory on the boundary of @xmath1 .",
    "qcd is classically but not quantum mechanically conformal .",
    "however , the ads / cft correspondence has provided important insights into qcd , such as confinement at large distances @xcite and chiral symmetry breaking@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "currently these topics are very active areas of research .",
    "the quantitative correspondence was specified in independent work by gubser , klebanov and polyakov  @xcite and by witten  @xcite @xmath2 which states that the generating functional for correlation functions with a source @xmath3 for some field theory operator is equivalent to the partition function of a supergravity theory where the boundary value of some supergravity field is the source for the field theory operator .",
    "the choice of supergravity field and field theory operator is a matter of matching the representations of the global symmetries of the two pair .    in recent years a new phenomenological approach , based on the rules of the ads / cft correspondence has been developed @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this approach introduces a five - dimensional classical theory in an @xmath4 background where appropriate fields are included in the action to act as sources on the boundary for operators of a qcd - like theory .",
    "this original formulation included only light quark operators and gave a phenomological model of chiral symmetry breaking . in the five - dimensional theory",
    "the symmetry is a gauge symmetry and a simple higgs mechanism is set up to model chiral symmetry breaking in the four - dimensional theory .",
    "the results from these relatively simple and phenomenological models are remarkable and the simplest realisation gives postdictions for several meson masses and decay constants with an average of around @xmath5 error .",
    "since the introduction of this phenomenological action , many advances have been made to model qcd more accurately .",
    "these include the introduction of linear confinement via an appropriately chosen scalar field in the five - dimensional theory@xcite , the inclusion of gluon condensate contributions to qcd quantities@xcite and studies of heavy quark potentials@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .    in @xcite , we considered the impact of a classical scalar field back - reacting on the geometry . in this case the impact on the geometry was most strongly affected by the condensate of light quarks .",
    "the strange quark was introduced @xcite in order to study the kaon sector and found that reasonably accurate predictions could be found for these mesons , too .    in this paper",
    "we ask what the impact of the strange quark on the geometry will be .",
    "we may expect that as the chiral symmetry is broken more explicitly for the strange quark the effect of the strange quark condensate on the dynamics of the theory may be less pronounced .",
    "in this section , we consider the impact of one scalar field on the metric .",
    "the total field content is the gravitational field plus the scalar field , which will be responsible for chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the lagrangian is given by @xmath6 @xmath7 is the five - dimensional ricci scalar , and the metric is @xmath8 the ricci scalar @xmath7 is given by @xmath9 from the action , one can find the equations of motion for the scalar field and for the metric tensor .",
    "@xmath10 + r_{pq } -tr\\partial_{p } \\phi \\partial_{q } \\phi = 0\\ , \\ ] ] and @xmath11 which gives @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 eq.([th5 ] ) and eq.([th6 ] ) give @xmath15 and @xmath16  from eq.([th8 ] ) , the function of @xmath17 can be obtained , given a solution for @xmath3 . then from eq.([th9 ] ) , one can find the potential @xmath18 .",
    "so , at no point do we need to rely on numerical techniques .",
    "we now give an example and show how to find the warp factor in the metric function in the presence of a scalar field .",
    "consider a scalar field , given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 and  @xmath21 are 3 by 3 matrix .",
    "@xmath22 we find @xmath23 then from eq.([th8 ] ) , and the uv boundary condition @xmath24 , the warp factor @xmath17 is found to be @xmath25 we see that the uv behaviour of the metric is not greatly modified by the back reaction of this scalar field .",
    "in this model of qcd , the three relevant operators are @xmath26,@xmath27 .",
    "+ now , let s consider the following action @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "we define the vector and axial - vector gauge bosons to be @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "following @xcite we choose the @xmath33gauge . from this action",
    "the classical value of the scalar field is found to be that we chose in eq.[eq.scalar ] .",
    "substituting @xmath34 back into the action , the mass matrix of @xmath35 and @xmath36 bosons can be calculated @xcite .",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the equations of motion for the vector and axial vector bosons can also be derived from eq.([phenomenaction ] ) . for convenience",
    "we make the following change of variable @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 \\phi_{v}^{\\alpha}(q , z)=0,\\label{eq.phiv}\\ ] ] and @xmath43 \\phi_{a}^{\\alpha}(q , z)=0,\\label{eq.phia}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 , with boundary conditions @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , similarly for@xmath47 .",
    "the mass of the vector and axial vector mesons can be obtained by solving the eigenvalue equations eq.([eq.phiv ] ) and eq.([eq.phia ] ) with @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the decay constants of these mesons can be obtained by @xmath50 where @xmath51 and the mass of the pseudoscalar meson can be obtained by solving @xmath52 with boundary conditions : + @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is defined as the longitudinal part of @xmath55,@xmath56  .",
    "the model now has six free parameters:@xmath63,@xmath64,@xmath65,@xmath66,@xmath67,@xmath68 .",
    "@xmath69 can be obtained by comparing the vector - vector two point function obtained from the ope of qcd to that obtained using the holographic recipe@xcite , giving @xmath70 .",
    "thus there are five free parameters left , we use an iterative method to fit the five free parameters .",
    "we start by fitting the parameters without the back reaction .",
    "that is , as a starting point we choose @xmath71 .",
    "using the following experimental data:@xmath72 , and a semi - global fit for @xmath73 , we then use an iterative search method to fix the free parameters in order to minimise the rms error on the remaining data .",
    "the final fit results are shown in table [ tab : parameter ] .               against theoretical values both with and without back - reaction .",
    "the results without back - reaction are calculated with @xmath75 and those with back - reaction are calculated using the parameters given in table [ tab : parameter ] .",
    ", width=453 ]      we plot the curvature as a function of the radial distance in the ads space , see figure 1 .",
    "figure 1 shows that the back reaction has only a small impact on the scalar curvature in the interval @xmath76 with a maximum of around @xmath77 departure from the pure ads result . for @xmath78",
    "the impact is larger but has no effect on our results .",
    "we also calculate the mass of @xmath79 resonances which is shown in figure 2 . however , because of the small difference between no - back - reaction case and back - reaction case , the two lines are almost indistinguishable on this scale .",
    "as the stringy effects are neglected in our present analysis , they are expected to become important in the uv .",
    "thus , the reliability of the current models will diminish above the scale of chiral symmetry breaking ( around 1200 mev ) .",
    "the main conclusion of this calculation is that even with the addition of strange quark dynamics the geometry and hence the spectra of masses and decay constants are not heavily affected .",
    "this is a non - trivial statement about the impact of the strange quark on chiral dynamics .",
