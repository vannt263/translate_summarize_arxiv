    "the super  kamiokande ( super  k ) experiment has reported evidence for the oscillation of muon neutrinos produced in cosmic - ray induced showers in the atmosphere , via the observation of @xmath0 disappearance as a function of neutrino pathlength and energy @xcite .",
    "the observed @xmath6 signal shows no excess , so is not consistent with substantial @xmath7 oscillation ; therefore the missing @xmath0 must be changing to an `` invisible '' flavor . since a @xmath1 charged - current ( cc )",
    "interaction would produce a @xmath5 lepton , @xmath1 below the 3.4  gev @xmath5 production threshold do not interact via the cc channel .",
    "@xmath1 above this threshold would produce @xmath5 leptons , but @xmath5 decay products would produce a multiplicity of particles . since the data set used to observe @xmath0 oscillation selects only single - particle events , only the resulting disappearance of @xmath0 is thus observed .",
    "an alternative scenario that can explain muon neutrino disappearance is oscillation with a sterile neutrino ( @xmath2 ) , which undergoes neither cc nor neutral current ( nc ) interactions . a fourth flavor of neutrino must be invoked to simultaneously explain apparent neutrino oscillations in three widely separated regimes : atmospheric neutrinos ; solar neutrinos @xcite ; and the lsnd experiment @xcite .",
    "however , studies of the @xmath8 at lep @xcite indicate that any such new light neutrino flavor must not interact via the weak force , leading to speculation about a sterile flavor .",
    "super  k has used two methods to distinguish between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 hypotheses for explaining atmospheric @xmath0 disappearance @xcite .",
    "the first method is to examine events likely to have been caused by nc interactions . while @xmath1 readily undergo such interactions , @xmath2 would not , resulting in a relative suppression of the nc signal .",
    "the second method exploits so - called `` matter effects '' , which reduce the oscillation amplitude of high - energy @xmath3 in the presence of matter @xcite . while the combination of these two analyses disfavors @xmath3 compared with @xmath4 , the observation of appearance of the newly created @xmath1 would be a definitive answer .",
    "presented here are an update to the nc and matter effect analyses and recent attempts to resolve such @xmath1 appearance .",
    "super  k is a 50  kt water cherenkov detector employing 11,146 photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) to monitor an internal detector ( i d ) fiducial volume of 22.5 kilotons . entering and exiting charged particles",
    "are identified by 1885 pmts in an optically isolated outer volume ( od ) .",
    "details of the detector , calibrations , and data reduction can be found in @xcite .",
    "fully - contained ( fc ) events deposit all of their cherenkov light in the i d while partially - contained ( pc ) events have exiting tracks which deposit some light in the od .",
    "the vertex position , number of cherenkov rings , ring directions , and momenta are reconstructed and the particle types are identified as `` @xmath9-like '' or `` @xmath10-like '' for each cherenkov ring . in the current 79.4 kiloton - year ( 1289 day ) fc sample , there are 3490 single - ring @xmath9-like events , 3346 single - ring @xmath10-like events and 3477 multi - ring events .    based on 1268 live days , this detector has also collected 1416 upward through - going muon ( utm ) events produced by atmospheric neutrino interactions in the surrounding rock .",
    "we required a minimum track length of 7  m in the inner detector and an upward muon direction .",
    "downward - going neutrino induced muons can not be distinguished from the 3  hz of cosmic ray muons .",
    "the fc single - ring data sample was analyzed to establish the region in ( @xmath11 ) oscillation parameter space where @xmath0 disappearance is taking place .",
    "this data sample is dominated by quasi - elastic neutrino interactions , which allow the tagging of the flavor of the parent neutrino via the flavor of the observed outgoing lepton .",
    "data was binned by energy , outgoing lepton flavor , and zenith angle of the lepton .",
    "the distance the neutrino has traveled can be inferred from the zenith angle , with those neutrinos coming from above having traveled only tens of km , and those coming from below the whole diameter of the earth . to provide an expected signal , 70 live - years equivalent of monte - carlo ( mc )",
    "data was used . as published by @xcite ,",
    "the number of of observed @xmath10-like events in bins with low energies and long baselines is suppressed compared with the non - oscillated mc expectations .    to evaluate the suitability of possible oscillation parameters , a mc expectation was calculated using the oscillation probability appropriate for both two - flavor @xmath12 and @xmath13 oscillations .",
    "a @xmath14 comparison of these mc predictions and the fc single - ring data yielded allowed regions in ( @xmath11 ) parameter space for both types of @xmath0 disappearance oscillations .",
    "for the case of @xmath13 , matter effects were included , although at the @xmath15  gev neutrino energies in this data sample the matter effects are small and the two resulting allowed regions very similar .",
    "this analysis results in two sets of neutrino oscillation parameters which are consistent with @xmath0 disappearance oscillations for a @xmath1 oscillation partner or a @xmath2 . for details of this fit",
    "see @xcite .",
    "a set of cuts were devised to isolate a comparatively nc rich data set .",
    "these events must be contained , neutrino - induced events with multiple rings , the brightest of which must be identified as an electron . furthermore , to improve the angular correlation of the observed particles to their parent neutrino , the total visible energy must be greater than 400  mev .",
    "this results in a mean angle difference between the parent neutrino and the reconstructed event direction of @xmath16 . when tested on the mc data ,",
    "these cuts produce a data sample containing a 29% fraction of nc events .",
    "the fc single ring sample discussed above contains only @xmath17 nc events .",
    "figure [ fig : mr](a ) shows the zenith angle distribution of these events with predictions from the mc .    since @xmath2 do not interact via a nc channel ,",
    "if the @xmath0 are changing into @xmath2 given sufficient distance to do so then the long - pathlength zenith angle bins coming from below will have comparatively fewer nc events and the ratio of up - to - down events will be reduced .",
    "however , @xmath1 do interact via the nc channel .",
    "thus , if the explanation of the mu - like event suppression observed in the fc data is that @xmath0 are changing to @xmath1 , then the nc event rate coming up from below will remain unchanged , as will the up / down ratio of nc events .",
    "we define `` upward '' as a cosine of zenith angle less than @xmath180.4 and `` downward '' as greater than + 0.4 .",
    "there are 465 upward events and 438 downward events in the nc - enriched sample .",
    "figure [ fig : mr](b ) shows the @xmath19 dependence of the expected up / down ratio in the case of full mixing ( @xmath20 . for @xmath21  ev@xmath22 , the data are consistent with @xmath23 , while the up / down ratio predicted by @xmath24 oscillations is 3.4@xmath25 too low .    using this up - to - down ratio helps to cancel some systematic uncertainties , particularly the rather large uncertainties in the nc cross - sections . the total systematic uncertainty in the up / down ratio of the data and mc is estimated to be @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "to look for the presence of matter effects upon the oscillation amplitude , we turn to a higher energy event sample as matter effects are strongest at high energies .",
    "the partially contained ( pc ) event sample is created by neutrino interactions in the fiducial volume of water which produce an outgoing particle with a high enough energy to escape the inner detector .",
    "pc events in super ",
    "k are estimated to be 97% pure @xmath0 cc and result from parent neutrinos with a mean of 10  gev .",
    "a further requirement of a visible energy of greater than 5  gev raises this mean neutrino energy to 20  gev .",
    "figure [ fig : mr](c ) shows the zenith angle distribution of these events with predictions from mc , as before .",
    "again an up / down ratio is employed to cancel systematic uncertainties using the same angular definition as for the multi - ring sample .",
    "there are 46 `` up '' events and 90 `` down '' events .",
    "figure [ fig : mr](d ) shows the @xmath19 dependence of the expected up / down ratio in the case of full mixing .",
    "since matter effects suppress oscillations to @xmath2 , the up / down ratio would remain near one in the case of @xmath13 oscillations .",
    "however , for @xmath27  ev@xmath22 , the observed up / down ratio is consistent with @xmath12 oscillations and 2.9@xmath25 too low for @xmath28 . the total systematic uncertainty in the up / down ratio is estimated to be @xmath29 .",
    "an even higher energy sample of neutrinos is observed by super ",
    "k and produces upward through - going muon events .",
    "these neutrinos interact in the rock below super  k and produce an outgoing muon with enough energy to reach and completely traverse the detector .",
    "the neutrinos which produce such events have a peak energy of 100  gev , maximizing any possible matter effect suppression of oscillation amplitudes . due to the down - going presence of cosmic ray muons , a `` vertical '' ( @xmath30 ) to `` horizontal '' ( @xmath31 ) ratio is used to probe this sample .",
    "figure [ fig : mr](e ) shows the zenith angle distribution of these events with predictions .",
    "figure [ fig : mr](f ) shows the @xmath19 dependence of the expected vertical / horizontal ratio in the case of full mixing . at the point of @xmath27  ev@xmath22 ,",
    "the data are consistent with @xmath12 oscillation , while the predicted suppression of oscillations via the matter effect on @xmath24 oscillations is again not seen at a significance of 2.9@xmath25 .",
    "we estimated the total systematic uncertainty in the horizontal / vertical flux ratio to be @xmath32 .",
    "all four data samples discussed ( fc single ring , nc , pc , and utm ) are independent .",
    "no data found in one is present in another .",
    "thus , the results of the four can be statistically combined to address the question of @xmath1 versus @xmath2 .",
    "the fc data sample sets the allowable range of ( @xmath35,@xmath36 ) that fit the observed @xmath0 disappearance oscillations for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "each pair of oscillation parameters in those allowed regions is used to generated an expected neutrino signal for each of the other three samples .",
    "this allows a comparison between the up / down or vertical / horizontal ratios observed in each of the three samples and that expected for both hypotheses .",
    "the data samples being independent , the sum of the squares of the three deviations between data and expectations should follow a @xmath37  distribution with three degrees of freedom .",
    "a ( @xmath35,@xmath36 ) pair is disfavored at the 90(99)% c.l . if the value of the sum is greater than 6.3(11.3 ) . for the case of @xmath38 ,",
    "all parameters allowed at 99% c.l . by the fc single - ring @xmath2 case are disfavored by least the 99% c.l . when the other three data sets are examined .",
    "however , all oscillation hypotheses in the @xmath4 fc 90% c.l .",
    "allowed region remain allowed by the three additional data sets .    , and the dashed for @xmath39 , with ( @xmath36 ,  @xmath40)=(@xmath41  ev@xmath42,1 ) .",

    "k data , a global @xmath37 was formed between all the atmospheric neutrino data present in super ",

    "systematic errors were treated in a similar fashion to @xcite .",
    "this global fit has 190 degrees of freedom .",
    "a pure @xmath1 oscillation partner produces expectations which have a @xmath37 difference from the data of 175.0 at the best fit point .",
    "pure @xmath2 as the oscillation partner yields @xmath45 at its best fit , and is disfavored by @xmath46 compared to pure @xmath1 . if the fraction of @xmath2 present in the oscillation sample ( @xmath47 ) is varied between these extremes such that @xmath48 , the maximum fraction of @xmath2 allowed at the 90(99)% c.l . by the complete set of super ",
    "k data is @xmath49% .",
    "thus , it is still possible for @xmath2 to be present in the atmospheric neutrino oscillations as a sub - dominant partner .",
    "in contrast to looking for ( and failing to find ) hints of @xmath2 , one could directly detect the presence of the newly created @xmath1 by observing the @xmath5 appearance associated with a @xmath1 interaction .",
    "this is difficult , because the @xmath5 itself has such a short lifetime that one must look for its decay products and then deduce that a @xmath5 was their parent .",
    "such events are both rather complicated and comparatively rare , as only a small component of the atmospheric neutrino spectrum exceeds the 3.4  gev @xmath5 production threshold .",
    "around 75 such interactions are expected to be in the existing data set .",
    "additionally , neutrino interactions which produce a number of pions or other mesons can mimic a @xmath5 decay within the finite resolution of the super  k detector .",
    "however , three separate analyses have looked for @xmath5 appearance in super ",
    "k , concentrating on hadronic decay modes .",
    "all three were developed using the existing atmospheric neutrino mc as background with a @xmath5 signal injected . to evaluate their expected sensitivity ,",
    "the resulting analyses were also applied to a mc atmospheric neutrino sample with @xmath5 included at the level of maximal mixing and @xmath50 , the remaining range of allowable oscillation parameters being considered here as a systematic error .",
    "the first analysis makes use of the standard super ",
    "k event reconstruction tools , which use likelihood calculations to compute to what degree the observed light pattern matches the expected distribution for a given set of particles .",
    "to isolate @xmath5 events , cuts are imposed on the visible energy , number of rings , number of decay electrons , the fraction of energy in the brightest ring , the distance from the first ring to the decay electron , the max muon momentum , the transverse momentum , and the particle i d of the brightest ring .",
    "the second analysis makes use of a neural - net algorithm , using variables obtained from the likelihood - based tools as input : number of rings found ; number of seeds used as the input to the ring counting algorithm ; number of decay electrons ; particle i d of most energetic ring ; number of muons ; and visible energy .",
    "the net was trained and tested on @xmath5 mc data and asked to classify data events as @xmath5 or not .",
    "the third analysis makes use of the fact that a @xmath5 produced near threshold will decay symmetrically , while a non-@xmath5 pion - production event will have remaining momentum and skew the resulting particles in one direction .",
    "thus , energy flow and jet - finding calculations are made in addition to initial cuts from the standard likelihood analysis .",
    ".@xmath5-appearance analyses , their efficiencies at saving @xmath5 events , the number of @xmath5 they observed , and the expected and observed significances of the signals . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     after development and testing using the mc data as inputs , the analyses were then applied to the atmospheric neutrino data set .",
    "the events were binned into five bins in @xmath51 , since if @xmath1 are being created via oscillations they will be coming upward ( at long pathlengths ) . a comparison between the data ,",
    "the mc expectations with no @xmath5 appearance included , and with an expectation including @xmath5 appearance was made .",

    "three independent data samples are presented that discriminate between the oscillations to either @xmath1 or @xmath2 in the region of ( @xmath35,@xmath36 ) parameter space favored by the majority of the super  k data .",
    "while two - flavor @xmath3 @xmath4 oscillations both fit the low energy charged current data , the pure @xmath2 hypothesis does not fit the higher energy and neutral current samples .",
