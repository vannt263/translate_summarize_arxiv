    "the method of including complete nlo qcd corrections to hard processes in the lo parton - shower monte carlo ( psmc ) , nicknamed , was originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where its first numerical implementation on top of a toy - model psmc was also presented .",
    "it was restricted there to gluon emission only and was elaborated for two processes : @xmath4 production in hadron ",
    "hadron collisions , i.e. the drell  yan ( dy ) process and deep inelastic electron ",
    "hadron scattering ( dis ) .    in the following ref.@xcite ,",
    "the method was implemented for @xmath4 production process at large hadron collider ( lhc ) in combination with sherpa @xcite and herwig++  @xcite psmcs .",
    "many nlo - class numerical results ( distributions of transverse momenta , rapidity , integrated cross sections , etc . ) were presented there and comparisons of the predictions with those from other methods , such as @xcite and @xcite , were also performed .    the main advantage of the method with respect to other , older methods of matching the fixed - order nlo calculations with psmcs ( and ) is its simplicity .",
    "this simplicity stems from the fact that the entire nlo corrections are implemented using a simple positive multiplicative mc weight .",
    "however , in order to profit from it , one has to use in the method parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in a special , so - called monte carlo ( mc ) factorisation scheme and psmc has to fulfil some minimum quality criteria .",
    "most of modern psmcs are good enough for the method .",
    "construction of pdfs in the mc factorisation scheme ( fs ) has evolved step by step : in ref .",
    "@xcite it was defined for gluonstrahlung only ( albeit for two different processes , dy and dis ) . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the pdfs in the mc fs were defined and numerically constructed including also gluon to quark transitions / splittings , relevant for the complete nlo corrections in the dy process , which at the lo level has only quarks and antiquarks in the initial state .",
    "pdfs in the mc scheme in ref .",
    "@xcite were defined in terms of the standard @xmath5 pdfs , and constructed numerically by transforming the @xmath5 pdfs into mc - scheme pdfs , before they were plugged into psmc used in the method .    however , in ref .",
    "@xcite certain elements in the transition matrix @xmath6 , transforming the @xmath5 pdfs into the mc - scheme pdfs could be omitted , because they were not relevant ( i.e.  of a nnlo class ) for the dy process .",
    "these elements of the transition matrix have to be added for any process with initial - state gluons , such as the higgs - boson production elaborated in the present work .",
    "they will be defined and applied in the following , such that the complete transition matrix @xmath6 transforming the @xmath5 pdfs into the mc - scheme pdfs will be specified for the first time .",
    "it will be argued that pdfs in such a mc - scheme can serve in the method for any process at a hadron ",
    "hadron collider in which a colour - neutral single or multiple system of heavy particles is produced . for other processes , with one or more coloured partons in the final state at lo level ,",
    "the method with pdfs in the mc scheme may also work , but this subject is reserved for the forthcoming publications .    the mc factorisation scheme is a complete scheme , such that nlo coefficient functions for any hard process under consideration are known , hence pdfs in the mc fs can be fitted directly to experimental dis and dy data .",
    "however , at present , we obtain them from pdfs in the @xmath5 scheme and leave out direct fitting to data for the future developments .    on the methodological side , as seen in refs .",
    "@xcite , the essence of the method is that certain nlo correction terms in an unintegrated / exclusive form present in the @xmath5 scheme , which are proportional to unphysical dirac - delta terms in transverse momentum of emitted real partons , are removed in the methodology by means of redefinition of pdfs from the @xmath5 to mc scheme .",
    "these ` pathological ' terms are preventing the use of a simple multiplicative mc weight for implementing nlo corrections in the @xmath5 scheme in real - emission phase space , and they complicate implementation of the and methods .",
    "these peculiar terms can be determined and calculated either by means of studying the nlo corrections to hard process ( coefficient functions ) , or , alternatively , by means of integrating soft - collinear counter terms ( similar to these in the catani  seymour method @xcite ) , which define the mc - scheme pdfs in @xmath7 dimensions - matrix transforming pdfs from the @xmath5 to mc scheme . ] .",
    "we are going to calculate them using both methods , obtaining the same results .",
    "last but not least , the nlo calculations for the dy process of ref.@xcite were also compared with nnlo calculations , concluding that they are closer to the latter than the results of the and methods .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following : in section 2 the method is characterised briefly . in section 3",
    "all distributions needed for implementation of the method for higgs - boson production in gluon ",
    "gluon fusion are elaborated , including also many analytical crosschecks and a necessary update of the virtual corrections in soft - collinear counter terms used in ref.@xcite for the @xmath4 ( dy ) process .",
    "section 4 presents numerical results for pdfs in the mc scheme .",
    "then , first numerical results for the total cross section from the method for the higgs production at the lhc are shown in section  5 . finally , in section 6 we summarise the paper and discuss future prospects of our work .",
    "the method was formulated in a few variants . for instance , in the version of ref .",
    "@xcite , the mc weight implementing the nlo corrections sums the contributions from all relevant partons generated in psmc next to the hard process `` democratically '' , such that it works equally well for psmcs based on angular ordering or virtuality ordering , contrary to which requires adding extra gluons to a psmc event . in the present work",
    ", we are going to follow the variant of discussed in ref.@xcite , in which the nlo - correcting mc weight uses only one parton , the one closest to the hard process in the transverse momentum , that is the 1@xmath8 parton generated in the backward evolution ( bev ) in the psmc algorithm with @xmath9-ordering .    in any case",
    ", in the method , the entire event of psmc is preserved and reweighted , contrary to and where the parton attributed to the hard process is generated outside psmc and , only later on , the remaining partons are provided by psmc .",
    "obviously , this puts certain minimum quality requirements on the the psmc : ( i ) the 1@xmath8 parton in bev algorithm has to be generated with the distribution which has a correct soft and collinear limit and ( ii ) its phase space in momentum and flavour space has to be covered completely , without empty regions .",
    "luckily , the above requirement is fulfilled by all modern psmcs for initial - state emissions discussed in this work .",
    "it is worth to comment in advance on the apparent use in the following of the soft - collinear counter terms ( dipoles ) of the catani ",
    "seymour ( cs ) subtraction scheme @xcite .",
    "their role is two - fold : ( 1 ) the cs dipoles serve us as a useful benchmark , as they provide a reference model for qcd distributions of real emissions featuring the exact soft and collinear limits and ( 2 ) the cs scheme helps us in a proper inclusion of the nlo virtual corrections . however , let us point out immediately an important difference between the mc and cs scheme : the cs dipoles do not include virtual corrections , while soft - collinear counter terms ( sccts ) of the do include them , albeit not calculated from feynman diagrams , but deduced from pdf momentum sum rules .",
    "the role of the sccts in the methodology is also much richer than that of the dipoles in the cs scheme ",
    "our sccts not only provide subtractions of soft - collinear singularities in real - emission phase space , but they are also used to define pdfs in the mc factorisation scheme .",
    "moreover , their sums are required to coincide with the corresponding sums of real - parton distributions in psmc .",
    "in the following we are going to collect all distributions needed for implementation of the method for the gluon - fusion higgs production in hadron  hadron collisions",
    ". elements of the matrix transforming pdfs from the @xmath5 to mc scheme will be also obtained as a byproduct .",

    "let us summarise on the motivation of introducing the new , mc pdfs and their main features , in form of a list of questions and answers :    * what is the purpose of mc factorisation scheme ?",
    "it is defined such that the @xmath173 terms due to emission from initial partons disappear completely from the real nlo corrections in the exclusive / unintegrated form , even before psmc gets involved . *",
    "why is the above vital in the scheme ? without eliminating such terms it is not possible to include the nlo corrections using simple multiplicative mc weights on top of distributions generated by psmc . * how to determine elements of the transition matrix @xmath174",
    "? they can be deduced from the difference of soft - collinear counter terms of the mc and @xmath5 scheme or from inspection of the nlo corrections in a few simple processes with initial quarks and gluons in the lo hard process .",
    "we have done it both ways .",
    "* will the same pdfs in the mc scheme eliminate @xmath175 terms for all processes ? this is a question about the _ universality _ of the mc factorisation scheme .",
    "for all processes similar to the dy or higgs - production process , with produced colour - neutral final - state objects , the answer is positive .",

    "( [ eq : transpdf ] ) and  ( [ eq : kmatrix ] ) .",
    "the upper panels show the absolute values of the @xmath5 and mc parton distributions taken at the scale @xmath177 , whereas the ratios of the two are displayed in the lower panels .",
    "two types of mc pdfs are plotted : the complete version ( red solid ) , where both quarks and gluons are transformed , and the `` dy '' version ( green dashed ) , where the gluon is unchanged with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "as discussed earlier , these types of mc pdfs is sufficient for the drell  yan process and it was used in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "hence , we show them here for comparison .",
    "one can see that the differences between the mc and @xmath5 pdfs are noticeable .",
    "in particular , the mc quarks are up to @xmath178 smaller at low and moderate @xmath179 , while they get above the @xmath5 distributions at large @xmath179 . for dy and higgs production ,",
    "the latter has consequences only at large rapidities of the bosons . at the same time",
    ", we notice that the gluon is larger in the mc scheme at low and moderate @xmath179 .",
    "hence , the changes in quarks and the gluon have a chance to compensate each other and , indeed , as we checked explicitly , the momentum sum rules ( [ eq : pdfs - msr ] ) are numerically satisfied for our mc pdfs",
    ".    other quark flavours , when transformed to the mc scheme , exhibit similar changes to those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcpdfs ] for the @xmath180 and @xmath181 quarks .    finally , let us comment briefly on the process - independence ( universality ) of the mc factorisation scheme and the method . if we treat eq .",
    "( [ eq : transpdf ] ) as a definition of pdfs in the mc scheme , then their universality is just inherited from the @xmath5 scheme .",
    "the universality of the method is more involved and it would imply that by means of adoption of these pdfs and a careful choice of the exclusive / unintegrated mc distributions for the initial - state splittings , we are able to eliminate from the nlo real corrections all terms proportional to @xmath182 or @xmath183 , which means that we can impose the nlo real corrections with the multiplicative mc weights in @xmath184 dimensions on top of the psmc distributions .",
    "we are able to state that the above is true for all annihilation process into colour - neutral objects .",
    "this can be deduced from analysing the cs counter terms ( which are compatible with the modern psmcs ) , where both the emitter and spectator are in the initial state .",
    "they are universal within the class of the above annihilation processes and therefore the method features the same property .",
    "the answer to the question whether extending this argument to other processes , with one or more coloured partons in the final state at the lo level , is not trivial and the relevant study is reserved to next dedicated publication .",
    "mc weights of the method for the higgs - boson production in gluon ",
    "gluon fusion are very simple , even simpler than those for drell - yan process , where they depend on the angles of the @xmath4 decay products . for the @xmath45 subprocess we have @xmath185 } =   \\frac{1+z^4 + \\alpha^4 + \\beta^4}{1 + z^4 + ( 1 - z)^4 } \\quad \\leq 1 , \\label{eq : wt - gg}\\ ] ] whereas for the @xmath53 channel",

    "they are just constant terms multiplied by the @xmath188 function . in the  method",
    "they should be included multiplicatively in a parton shower generator for the corresponding process , i.e.  the born - level cross section should be multiplied by the weight @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the virtual+soft - real correction . for the higgs - boson production , it can be read off from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : c2ggmc ] ) and ( [ eq : c2gqmc ] ) to get @xmath191    for the numerical evaluation of the cross sections at the lhc for the proton  proton collision energy of @xmath192  tev , we choose the following set of the standard model ( sm ) input parameters : @xmath193 and the @xmath194-scheme  @xcite for the electroweak sector . to compute the hadronic cross section we also use the mstw2008 lo set of parton distribution functions  @xcite , and take the renormalisation and the factorisation scales to be @xmath195 , where @xmath196 is the higgs - boson mass .",
