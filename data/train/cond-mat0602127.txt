    "the perovskite - type barium zirconate titanate , bati@xmath0zr@xmath1o@xmath2 ( btz ) , has attracted considerable attention as a possible lead - free ferroelectric material to replace the current industry standard lead - based ferroelectrics @xcite .",
    "the particularity of btz is the continuous change of its properties from a ferroelectric behavior at low zr substitution rates to a relaxor ferroelectric ( relaxor ) behavior at higher substitution rates ( 0.25 @xmath6 0.5 ) @xcite .",
    "the low substitution regime has been mainly studied for its interest in lead - free ferroelectric memories @xcite . however , due to the recent report of outstanding electro - mechanical properties in relaxor - based ferroelectric solid solutions @xcite , it is rather the relaxor regime of btz which currently attracts a large research effort .",
    "relaxors are characterized by a broad and frequency - dependent dielectric anomaly as a function of temperature , instead of a sharp and frequency - independent divergence as in classical ferroelectrics . in a relaxor such as pbmg@xmath7nb@xmath8o@xmath9 ( pmn ) ,",
    "the anomaly surprisingly occurs in a cubic average structure which remains centrosymmetric ( non polar ) at all temperatures .",
    "it is generally admitted that the peculiar properties of relaxors are related to the presence of nano - scaled polar regions @xcite , due to different cation shifts in different parts of the structure .",
    "two necessary ingredients are often cited for a relaxor ferroelectric : ( i ) the presence of pb@xmath10 or bi@xmath11 cations ( showing large displacements due to their lone - pair ) and/or ( ii ) a heterovalent cationic disorder ( generating random local electric fields @xcite that break long - range polar correlations ) .",
    "they are both present in the extensively studied model relaxor pmn ( e. g. refs . ) . on the other hand ,",
    "btz relaxors present a homovalent zr@xmath12/ti@xmath12 substitution , which does not give rise to such random electric fields .",
    "therefore , another mechanism has to be considered in order to account for the break of long - range correlated displacements in btz .",
    "it has been proposed that random elastic fields , induced by the difference in size of zr@xmath12 and ti@xmath12 cations , play an important role @xcite .",
    "yet it is not known how , and on which scale such random elastic fields build up .",
    "the bati@xmath0zr@xmath1o@xmath2 solid solution thus opens an interesting route towards the comprehension of the relaxor behavior , and raises much interest @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is intriguing that pbzr@xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath2 ( pzt ) shows no relaxation @xcite while btz does .",
    "the average crystal structure of the btz relaxors ( 0.25 @xmath13 0.5 ) is cubic ( space group @xmath14 ) at any temperature @xcite .",
    "local distortions away from the ideal cubic structure expected from the observation of the relaxation behavior are evidenced by the observation of a first - order raman scattering @xcite , which is forbidden in a perfect primitive cubic structure .",
    "however , the latter technique does not reveal the nature of these distortions .",
    "the aim of the present study is to determine the local structure and chemical order in btz relaxors . for this purpose",
    ", we used exafs ( extended x - ray absorption fine structure ) spectroscopy which is a structural and chemical local probe .",
    "this technique has been proven to be a powerful tool to analyze the local distortions in ferroelectric perovskites ( e. g. refs . ) . on the other hand ,",

    "the local structure parameters were determined up to distances of 4.5  from the zr atoms , giving information on their local environment up to their fourth neighbors .",
    "hence , the zr / ti repartition could be probed , as well as the distortions induced by the substitution of ti atoms by zr ones in batio@xmath2 . in order to have a proper reference for the understanding of the local zr environment",
    ", we also studied bazro@xmath2 under the same experimental conditions .",
    "bati@xmath0zr@xmath1o@xmath2 ( @xmath3=0.25 , 0.30 , 0.35 and 1 ) powders were synthesized by solid state reaction , starting from the appropriate amounts of baco@xmath2 , tio@xmath15 , and zro@xmath15 powders and following the method described in ref . .",
    "they were then characterized by x - ray diffraction at 300 k. all the powders were found to be single phases within the accuracy of the experiment .",
    "the cubic cell parameters are 4.054(1 ) , 4.061(1 ) , 4.072(1 ) , and 4.192(1 )   for @xmath3 values of 0.25 , 0.30 , 0.35 , and 1 respectively .",

    "the two techniques yield quite different values of distances . on one hand ,",
    "the xrd measurements show that the unit cell dimensions of btz samples follow the vegard s law , i.e. , the cell volume linearly increases from its value in batio@xmath2 ( 64.286 @xmath71 ) to that in bazro@xmath2 ( 73.665 @xmath71 ) . in the cubic relaxor samples ,",
    "all the average distances then linearly increase with the zr substitution rate @xmath3 . on the other hand , the distances deduced from the exafs analysis",
    "systematically exceed those expected in the average structure and , with the exception of the zr - ba distance , are found to be independent of @xmath3 . considering that exafs probes the structure on a very local scale ,",
    "the latter observation is direct evidence that the local structure is different from the average structure .",
    "we have shown in sec .",
    "[ results ] that zr - atoms tend to segregate in btz relaxors .",
    "the latter result is in agreement with previous speculations based on raman scattering @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the zr - rich regions consist of bazro@xmath2 spherical inclusions in a batio@xmath2 matrix , one can calculate the mean number of segregated atoms .",
    "it is estimated to 27 , 15 , and 10 in bati@xmath23zr@xmath24o@xmath2 , bati@xmath69zr@xmath70o@xmath2 , and bati@xmath67zr@xmath68o@xmath2 respectively , which corresponds to diameters of 14.1 , 11.5 , and 10.8  @xmath50 .",
    "the exafs study of btz relaxors at the zr k - edge allowed us to evidence local structural deviations from the average cubic structure , as well as chemical inhomogeneities . in the following",
    ", we shall propose a microstructural picture of btz relaxors and discuss its origin and implications on the relaxor behaviour . in order to expose the possible basic physical mechanisms in a clear and simple manner , we will assume that the segregation of zr atoms consists of small inclusions of bazro3 in a batio3 matrix",
    ". however , the real repartition of the zr atoms could be much more complex ( see sec .",
    "[ results ] ) .    such bazro@xmath2 inclusions in btz relaxors must be submitted to a chemical pressure from the batio@xmath2 environment , which has a smaller unit cell volume than bazro@xmath2 .",
    "it is first interesting to note that the zr - o distance in btz relaxors is almost insensitive to this chemical pressure , since it is the same as in bazro@xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ distexafs - drx]-a ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the zr - ba distance decreases with increasing ti - content ( fig .",
    "[ distexafs - drx]-b ) and hence , is more sensitive to the chemical pressure . this latter difference in _",
    "perovskites is well understood within the polyhedral approach : the _",
    "a_-o distance in perovskites is generally more compressible than the shorter _",
    "b_-o distance in the closed - packed bo@xmath60 octahedra @xcite .",
    "insight into the _ b_o@xmath60 linkage can be also gained from the @xmath72 angle value , which deviates considerably from 180@xmath58 ( table [ fitbtz ] ) . in a perovskite structure ,",
    "the presence of buckled zr - o - zr bonds suggests the presence of octahedron tilts . this distortion could be a direct consequence of the chemical pressure exerted by the surrounding batio@xmath2 matrix . within this context ,",
    "let us remind that hydrostatic pressure reveals and/or enhances structural lattice instabilities related to tilts in the perovskite compounds with _ b_o@xmath60 polyhedra more rigid than _ a_o@xmath73 ones @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been proposed in the literature that bazro@xmath2 undergoes a pressure - induced phase transition to the tilted @xmath74 perovskite structure @xcite ( glazer s notations @xcite ) . assuming that the bazro@xmath2 inclusions adopt the latter structure in btz relaxors , the tilt angle calculated from the buckling angle of the zr - o - zr bonds is about 11@xmath58 , which is a reasonable value for a tilted perovskite @xcite . in summary , within our simplified picture , bazro@xmath2 inclusions do not adopt the cubic bulk structure of bazro@xmath2 but present considerable distortions away from it .",
    "the zr environment in btz relaxors appears to be determined by both the high stiffness of the zro@xmath60 octahedra and chemical pressure effects .",
    "let us now discuss the structure around the inclusions .",
    "given that the zr - zr distance is approximately 2% larger than the average _",
    "cation distance deduced from xrd ( fig .",
    "[ distexafs - drx]-c ) , we expect a significant strain at the interface of the bazro@xmath2 inclusions and the batio@xmath2 matrix .",
    "the tio@xmath60 octahedra adjacent to the inclusions likely accommodate the structural misfit between bazro@xmath2 inclusions and the batio@xmath2 matrix .",
    "considering that the cell volume of bazro@xmath2 is larger than that of batio@xmath2 , we expect that these adjacent tio@xmath60 octahedra are submitted to a tensile strain .",
    "although their deformation shape remains an open question , different ti@xmath12 displacements ( and thus polarity ) are expected in the adjacent regions when compared to the batio@xmath2 matrix .",
    "we have already mentioned in the introduction that the ferroelectric pbzr@xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath2 ( pzt ) , similar to btz , does surprisingly present no relaxation , making the comparison of btz to pzt insightful .",
    "first , we note that in both btz and pzt , the mean zr - o distance is almost unaffected by the ti - content , and the observed zr - o distance distribution is of the same order of magnitude @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", the relaxor properties of btz can not be linked to the first neighbour environment of zr atoms .",
    "a key feature for understanding the different behaviors of btz and pzt could lie in the local chemical order , which is known to play a determinant role for relaxor properties ( e.g. the so - called 1:1 mg / nb order on the nanometer scale in pmn ) @xcite . in that context",
    ", it is interesting to note that btz can not be synthesized in the region @xmath75 ( ref . ) , which suggests an important internal chemical strain which inhibits the formation of btz across the whole composition range .",
    "we speculate that the local phase segregation observed for btz relaxors is a precursor for the macroscopic phase separation observed for higher zr substitution rates .",
    "such an internal chemical strain does not seem to exist for pzt since it forms a solid solution whatever the zr / ti ratio .",
    "the distribution of elastic fields is thus expected to differ significantly from btz to pzt .",
    "in particular , the strain around the local phase separation in btz can be regarded as the source of the elastic random fields which have been proposed earlier by farhi et al @xcite .",
    "such elastic random fields ( similarly to electric random fields in common relaxors ) are then considered to lead to particular local pattern of polar regions , which become the source of relaxor properties .",
