    "considered , the kinematical region is below @xmath73 for the decay @xmath1 and below @xmath74 for the others .",
    "one can see that they are far below the @xmath16 wave resonant region ( @xmath75 ) .",

    "in fact , this approximation is often used in parameterizing the @xmath2 wave fsi with phase shift data @xcite .",
    "the full @xmath2 wave @xmath84 @xmath28-matrix can be expressed as    @xmath85    where @xmath86 denotes the full @xmath2 wave @xmath87 @xmath28-matrix in the isospin @xmath88 channel , which is the solution of a set of on - shell coupled channel bses @xcite .",
    "now , the @xmath28-matrix for the @xmath89 decay can be expressed as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the amplitude of the tree diagram ( a ) , @xmath92 is the @xmath2 wave component of @xmath91 and @xmath93 is the two meson loop propagator @xmath94 the numerical calculation is done by introducing a three - momentum cutoff @xmath95 .",
    "the value of the cutoff is taken as that used in @xcite , where the @xmath3 scattering data can be well reproduced up to 1.2 gev , namely , the @xmath3 fsi in our model is consistent with the @xmath3 scattering data .",

    "in the model , the parameters involved are the coupling constants @xmath103 , @xmath15 and @xmath104 .",
    "the values of the parameters can be determined by fitting the experimental data of the @xmath11 process .",
    "it is shown that the resultant @xmath104 value is so small that we can safely take @xmath105 .",
    "the remaining coupling constants @xmath103 and @xmath15 are obtained by fitting the total decay rate and the @xmath0 invariant mass spectrum simultaneously .",
    "the decay data of the @xmath11 process are taken from ref.@xcite .",
    "these bes data are normalized by using @xmath106 and @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "the resultant coupling constants are @xmath108    1.cm -1.5 cm    our best fit to the @xmath0 invariant mass spectrum and the @xmath109 distribution are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : psi ] .",
    "it is found that the @xmath0 invariant mass spectrum is well - fitted , but the theoretical angular distribution is somewhat too flat .",
    "note that in fitting angular distribution , we only consider @xmath109 from -0.8 to 0.8 , because the efficiency correction to the data at large @xmath110 is not accurate enough @xcite .",
    "the deviation in angular distribution implies that the @xmath16 wave contribution is somehow too small .",
    "in fact , as discussed in section  [ sec : for ] , in our calculation , the @xmath16 wave fsi is not included .",
    "it is also found that the @xmath2 wave fsi enhances the invariant mass spectrum considerably .",
    "it should be noted that due to @xmath111 , integrating over @xmath109 will result that the @xmath16 wave contribution is not so important in the invariant mass spectrum .",
    "however , in the angular distribution , the @xmath109-dependence , and consequently the @xmath16 wave effect , will explicitly show up .",
    "thus , we deem that the deviation in angular distribution may be due to lack of @xmath16 wave fsi .",
    "in fact , it can be confirmed in the following way : in ref.@xcite , without fsi , the authors can well - reproduce both the @xmath3 invariant mass spectrum and the angular distribution with @xmath112 , @xmath113@xmath114 and @xmath105 .",
    "however , with the @xmath2 wave fsi , in the best data fitting to the @xmath3 invariant mass spectrum , the resultant @xmath103 is 0.106 which is 3 times less than that in ref .",
    "@xcite , while @xmath113 keeps almost the same value as that in ref .",
    "this means that the effect of the @xmath2 wave fsi is so large that @xmath103 has to be much smaller to explain the @xmath3 invariant mass spectrum . as a consequence",
    ", the @xmath16 wave component is also greatly reduced .",
    "if we naively multiply a factor of 3 to the @xmath16 wave component , the angular distribution can also be reproduced better .",
    "unfortunately , as mentioned above , the @xmath16 wave fsi can not be treated properly in the simple chut approach @xcite .",
    "similar to the case of @xmath8 , in the @xmath9 or @xmath10 decay , @xmath105 can be adopted .",
    "but for the @xmath1 decay , the @xmath2 wave fsi is no longer a main contributor , and a finite value of @xmath104 is requested . with this consideration , mannel et al",
    ". showed that the resultant values of @xmath113 for the @xmath9 and @xmath10 processes are very close , but quite different from that for the @xmath1 process .",
    "the latter one is about ten times larger than the former @xcite .",
    "this is somewhat unnatural . suffice to say , the pions involved in @xmath1 are somewhat harder than in the other bottomonium transitions , and in principle the values of @xmath113 for these processes",
    "should not be the same for different dynamical regions .",
    "however , in the decay processes considered , the vector mesons involved are all in the @xmath2 wave state , and the particles involved are in the same mass scale , and the difference among kinematical regions is not too large .",
    "thus we deem that the values of @xmath113 for these processes should be very close . to reduce the number of free parameters , we take the same @xmath113 value for different @xmath115 decays .",
    "2.cm -1.5 cm    2.cm 1.cm -1.5 cm    the decay data for @xmath9 are taken from @xcite and for @xmath10 and @xmath1 from @xcite . to get the physical coupling constants ,",
    "the data for @xmath9 @xcite is normalized by @xmath116 and @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "our calculated results are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : noxfit]-[fig : nox31fit ] .",
    "it is shown that the resultant @xmath3 invariant mass spectra for both @xmath9 and @xmath10 decays agree with the data values , but the angular distribution for the former one is somewhat flat , which might also be due to the same reason discussed in section  [ sec : psi ] .",
    "on the other hand , there is almost no way to fit the @xmath0 invariant mass spectrum and the @xmath109 distribution of the @xmath118 process simultaneously , even if @xmath113 is further released as a free parameter .",
    "the resultant parameters are listed in tab .",

    "resultant parameters through data fitting .

[",
    "fig : analyze ] . in the figure ,",
    "the solid curves represent our best fitted results , and the dotted , dashed , and dash - dotted curves describe the contributions from the terms without @xmath122 and with @xmath122 only and the interference term respectively , and the dash - dot - dotted curves represent the tree level contributions with @xmath122 only .",
    "the calculated @xmath3 invariant mass spectrum ( fig .  [ fig : analyze ] ( a ) ) shows that the contribution from @xmath122 plays a dominant role , the contribution from the terms without @xmath122 can qualitatively but not quantitatively give the two - peak feature , and the interference term contributes constructively in the smaller @xmath3 invariant mass region but destructively in the larger invariant mass region . the resultant @xmath120 distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : analyze ] ( b ) ) further shows that the contribution from @xmath122 , even in the tree level , produces almost the whole angular distribution structure .",
    "although the scalar meson @xmath24 dynamically generated by the @xmath2 wave @xmath3 fsi in chut @xcite can make a peak around its pole position at about 450 mev in the @xmath3 invariant mass spectrum , the contribution from the diagrams without @xmath122 is not dominant due to smaller values of coupling constants .",
    "thus , an additional @xmath16 wave fsi which provides a flat contribution in the invariant mass region considered will not be an important contributor .",
    "these indicate that the intermediate state @xmath122 is very important in reproducing not only the @xmath119 invariant mass spectrum but also the @xmath123 distribution in the @xmath121 decay .",
    "if we further consider the quark structures of the particles involved , the intermediate state should contain @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "this state might be a tetraquark state , for instance , @xmath126 , with @xmath4 and @xmath5 for @xmath127 or a @xmath128 bound state , for instance , @xmath129 , for @xmath127 .",
    "it should be mentioned that similar mechanism was also proposed by v.v .",
    "anisovich _ et al._@xcite . in their paper ,",
    "a trivial @xmath2 wave coupling was used in the effective vertex @xmath130 which is described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : v0 ] ) in our model with both @xmath2 wave and @xmath16 wave components . with that mechanism ,",
    "they successfully reproduced the @xmath3 invariant mass spectra of the @xmath131 decays , but did not give reasonable @xmath109 distributions due to the dominance of the @xmath3 @xmath2 wave in their model .",
    "as a result , the estimated mass of the additional intermediate state is in the range of 10.4 - 10.8 gev which is located outside the data area of the dalitz plot where the data points in the direction of @xmath132 are located from 9.6 gev to 10.2 gev .",
    "thus the effect of the state does not show up in the dalitz plot .",
    "the mass and width of the intermediate state in our work are different from those in ref .",
    "we also present the dalitz plot for the @xmath1 decay in fig .",
    "[ fig : dalitz ] .",
    "it is shown that although the estimated mass of @xmath122 in our model ( @xmath133 gev ) is inside the data area in the dalitz plot , the signal of @xmath122 in the dalitz plot is not very clear due to its large width of 0.655 gev .",
    "it does not conflict with the cleo experiment @xcite .",
    "moreover , we would mention that with the typical values , @xmath134=10.5 gev and @xmath135=0.15 gev given in ref .",
