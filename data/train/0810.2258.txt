    "electromagnetic decays of vector mesons are a good probe of the hot and dense state created after a nucleus - nucleus collision .",
    "indeed , the emitted lepton pairs , which carry the spectral information of the vector meson at the moment of the decay , undergo a negligible distortion as they travel through the dense medium @xcite .",
    "this fact can in turn tell us about properties of the medium .",
    "we consider interactions with pions ( @xmath1 ) and nucleons ( @xmath2 ) as scatterings of the @xmath0 meson that contribute to its self - energy . in this approach the forward scattering amplitude ( fsa )",
    "is composed of a low energy and a high energy part .",
    "the latter is described by regge parameterization whereas former encompasses two terms , namely a resonance term modeled by breit - wigner functions and background term . in the center of mass ( c.m . )",
    "frame the low energy fsa is written as : @xmath3 here the sum ranges over all breit - wigner resonances that decay into the @xmath0 meson and the particle @xmath4 which is either a nucleon or a pion .",
    "we now briefly explain the different variables involved .",
    "the mass of the resonance @xmath5 is @xmath6 and its total width is @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is the usual mandelstam variable and the magnitude of the c.m .",
    "momentum is given by : @xmath9 \\left [ s - \\left ( m_\\phi - m_a \\right)^2 \\right ] } } { \\sqrt{s } } \\label{eq : qcm}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 are statistical spin / isospin averaging factors : @xmath12 where @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 generic ) is the spin of particle @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the isospin of that particle .",
    "the effective width @xmath16 takes the form @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the total width of the resonance @xmath5 , @xmath19 is the branching ratio of the decay @xmath20 , @xmath21 \\left [ m^{2}_{r } - \\left ( m_\\phi - m_a \\right)^2 \\right ] } } { m_{r } } $ ] , and @xmath22 is the minimal relative angular momentum between @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "the case of the pions is a bit more complicated for the @xmath23 case however , as adler s theorem should be fulfilled .",
    "that is , the pion scattering amplitude on any hadronic target vanishes when @xmath24 in the limit of massless pions @xcite .",
    "consequently , the effective width for @xmath23 now must be rewritten as : @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "finally , the high energy fsa is well described by a regge parametrization of the form : @xmath27 r_{\\phi a}^{i } s^{\\alpha_i}. \\label{eq : f_high}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 can be a nucleon or a pion as mentioned before .",
    "the variables @xmath28 and @xmath29 are regge residues and intercepts which are determined experimentally @xcite .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the fsa are plotted in fig.[pic : re_im_f ] .",
    "these plots are made relative to the rest frame of the heath bath .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the results show that the mass shift overall is small , reaching 38 mev at most .",
    "there is a significant broadening of the width of the @xmath0 meson however . at normal nucleon density and temperature of 150mev ,",
    "the width more than 90 mev .",
    "our results are important for understanding possible in - medium modifications of the @xmath0 meson strongly interacting environments .",
    "studies to estimate phenomenological implications are in progress @xcite .",
