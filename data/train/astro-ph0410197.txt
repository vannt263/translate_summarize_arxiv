    "a wide variety of nonradial oscillations have been previously investigated for neutron stars ( nss ) with the majority of these studies focusing on surface g - modes ( oscillations whose restoring force is gravity ; mcdermott , van horn & scholl 1983 ; finn 1987 ; mcdermott & taam 1987 ; mcdermott , van horn & hansen 1988 , hereafter mvh88 ; mcdermott 1990 ; strohmayer 1993 ; bildsten & cutler 1995 , hereafter bc95 ; bildsten , ushomirsky & cutler 1996 ; strohmayer & lee 1996 ; bildsten & cumming 1998 ; piro & bildsten 2004 ) because their frequencies are similar to many of the oscillations observed from nss ( for example burst oscillations ; muno et al .",
    "these modes are confined to outer regions of the ns surface due to the shear modulus of the ns crust ( as illustrated by bc95 and further discussed here ) , so that their frequencies are independent of the deep ns crust composition and small amounts of energy will lead to large amplitudes .",
    "however one mode has consistently been neglected , which is the wave analogous to a shallow water wave in the outermost parts of the star .",
    "unlike a global surface wave ( i.e. f - mode ) , we expect this wave to be confined to the ns ocean just like the g - modes , but a correct prediction of its frequency requires proper treatment of its eigenfunction at the ocean / crust boundary .    a study of nonradial oscillations on non - rotating , non - magnetic nss was presented by mvh88 for three - component ns models ( consisting of an ocean , crust , and core ) , examining g - modes , acoustic oscillations ( p - modes ) , and f - modes . in addition , mvh88 reported a new set of oscillations , which they called `` interface modes . '' these modes are unique in that they `` live '' ( have amplitudes concentrated ) around discontinuities in the ns structure . for their three - component model",
    ", they found these modes at both the ocean / crust interface and the crust / core interface .",
    "we now undertake a detailed investigation of the ocean / crust interface mode so that it may be used for accreting nss and in the other astrophysical context where a shear modulus is important , crystalline white dwarfs ( wds ) ( e.g. hansen & van horn 1979 , hereafter hv79 ; montgomery & winget 1999 ) .",
    "to focus our analysis we consider the interface mode for a two - component ns model consisting of an ocean and crust .",
    "we use this model because of the simplification provided by the plane parallel geometry of the outer ns layers .",
    "the most important property of the interface mode is how it couples with the top of the ns crust ( figure 1 ) .",
    "mvh88 showed that the interface mode has a large and approximately constant transverse velocity in the ocean , similar to a shallow water wave . indeed this mode can be thought of as a surface wave riding on a compressible crust .",
    "it is therefore not a toroidal mode as one might expect if the interface wave were like a shear wave ( see appendix a ) . as its pressure perturbation rolls over the crust s surface ,",
    "the crust is compressed and sinks .",
    "this flexing causes the interface mode to have a large , negative radial displacement at the discontinuity ( see the right diagram of figure 1 ) in contrast with the typical boundary condition for surface water waves , which treats the crustal boundary as solid with no radial displacement ( see the left diagram of figure 1 ) . since the pressure perturbation also corresponds to a small , positive swell at the top of the ocean , the radial displacement eigenfunction must necessarily have a single node within the ocean .",
    "this simple picture describes the interface mode quite well .",
    "the frequency depends on the properties at the base of the ocean , like a surface ocean wave , but with a frequency that is altered by the non - zero radial displacement at the ocean / crust boundary .",
    "this boundary condition reduces the frequency by @xmath1 from what is expected if the crust were `` solid , '' where @xmath2 is the shear modulus and @xmath3 is the pressure at the top of the crust .",
    "most of the energy of the mode is in the ocean , just as in a shallow surface wave .",
    "we derive the adiabatic perturbation equations for a plane parallel layer in hydrostatic balance with a shear stress in  2 .",
    "these are used in  3 to analytically estimate the interface mode s radial eigenfunction and frequency .",
    "we follow this with a numerical study in  4 that confirms our analytic results and also provides more detail about the eigenfunctions .",
    "we conclude in  5 with a discussion of possible uses for the interface mode in astrophysical contexts .",
    "maybe most exciting among these is an additional mode of oscillation in wds with crystalline cores .",
    "since the pressure scale height in the ns ocean , @xmath4 , is always much less the ns radius , @xmath5 , we approximate the surface as having constant gravitational acceleration , @xmath6 ( neglecting general relativity ) , and plane parallel geometry .",
    "we use @xmath7 as our radial coordinate and @xmath8 as the transverse coordinate .",
    "an additional useful coordinate in this geometry is the column depth , denoted as @xmath9 ( defined by @xmath10 and with cgs units of @xmath11 ) .",
    "the interface mode s period is set by physics at the ocean / crust boundary , and is insensitive to the outer boundary condition . at these depths",
    "the thermal timescale is longer than the mode period ( since @xmath12 and @xmath9 is large ; where @xmath13 is the specific heat capacity and @xmath14 is the flux ) so that the perturbations are adiabatic .",
    "the governing equations of the envelope are conservation of mass , @xmath15 , and momentum , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the stress tensor , and @xmath18 is a radial unit vector ( repeated indices imply the einstein summation convention unless noted otherwise ) .",
    "we neglect the ns spin so that we can focus on the effects of the crust .",
    "rotation can be simply included using the `` traditional approximation '' ( e.g. bildsten , ushomirsky & cutler 1996 ) .    we make eulerian perturbations of the conservation equations , substituting for the dependent variables @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the static background ( this subscript is dropped in subsequent expressions ) .",
    "perturbations are assumed to have the form @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the transverse wavenumber and @xmath23 is the mode frequency .",
    "these eulerian perturbations are related to lagrangian perturbations by @xmath24 . since the background model has no fluid motion we substitute @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the local lagrangian displacement .",
    "we use the cowling approximation and neglect perturbations of the gravitational potential ( cowling 1941 ) , an excellent approximation in the thin outer layers of the ns . keeping terms of linear order , we find @xmath27 for continuity .",
    "in making linear perturbations of equation ( 1 ) we include the effects of a finite shear modulus ( such as in the ns crust ) .",
    "relative displacements then introduce a shear component to the lagrangian stress tensor given by ( landau & lifshitz 1970 ) .",

    "this transition occurs at @xmath37 ( farouki & hamaguchi 1993 and references therein , following the work of brush , sahkin & teller 1966 ) . since the pressure in the crust is dominated by degenerate electrons we rewrite @xmath2 as @xmath38 in the crust @xmath39 is fairly independent of temperature ( except for a small dependence due to the factor of @xmath40 in the denominator ) , so we typically substitute @xmath41 and assume that @xmath42 is constant with depth .    in the adiabatic limit , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the adiabatic exponent .",
    "the lagrangian stress tensor is @xmath45 and the eulerian stress tensor is @xmath46 so that the perturbed momentum balance equation is @xmath47 equations ( 2 ) and ( 9 ) describe the nonradial oscillations .",
    "the fluid viscosity in the ocean barely resists shear so that the lagrangian stress tensor has only diagonal components , @xmath48 . breaking equation ( 9 ) into radial and transverse components , @xmath49 combining equations ( 2 ) , ( 10 ) , and ( 11 ) results in the standard nonradial oscillation equations for an inviscid fluid in hydrostatic balance and plane parallel geometry , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the brunt - visl frequency which measures the internal buoyancy of the envelope .",
    "normal modes of oscillation are found by assuming @xmath52 at the top boundary ( a fluid element riding at the top feels no pressure perturbation ) and then shooting for the bottom boundary condition .",
    "this top condition , though not unique , is fairly robust since little mode energy resides in the low density upper altitudes of the ocean ( bc95 ) .",
    "when @xmath53 , expanding equation ( 9 ) in both the radial and transverse directions , and using the adiabatic condition and equation ( 2 ) to eliminate @xmath54 and @xmath55 , results in @xmath56      \\nonumber      \\\\      & & + ik_x\\frac{d\\xi_x}{dz}\\left ( \\frac{\\mu}{3p } + \\gamma_1 \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath57 the crustal mode equations derived by bc95 .",
    "the second derivatives in equations ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) imply additional boundary conditions at the ocean / crust interface .",
    "we require that @xmath58 is continuous , so that there is no `` space '' between the two layers , and that @xmath59 is continuous , otherwise there is an infinite radial acceleration across the boundary .",
    "furthermore , @xmath60 because the ocean , with no shear modulus , can not sustain finite transverse shear .",
    "we also require the additional boundary conditions that @xmath61 at some depth deep within the crust .",
    "though this is not necessarily the case , it is helpful for estimating the interface mode s frequencies .",
    "we now use these differential equations to analytically derive the frequencies and eigenfunctions of the interface mode . as we explain in appendix a ,",
    "the interface wave is not well described by wkb analysis , so we proceed with use of analogies to shallow ocean surface waves . in ",

    "3.2 we solve for the radial crustal eigenfunction , which we use in @xmath63 to connect to the ocean perturbation and find the radial displacement at the interface . in ",
    "3.4 we summarize our frequency prediction for the interface wave and show how it depends on the temperature and composition of the ns crust .",

    "the frequency of this surface wave is set by specifying the boundary condition @xmath80 . substituting this into equation ( 20 ) we find a frequency @xmath81 to understand this result it is helpful to compare it to the frequency for a mode with @xmath82 as expected for a solid floor , which we denote as @xmath83 .",
    "this results in @xmath84 for @xmath85 we find that @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the scale height at the bottom of the ocean , just as expected for the shallow surface wave .",
    "the interface mode s frequency is then @xmath88 we expect @xmath89 because a positive pressure perturbation will compress the crust ( see the discussion in  1 and figure 1 ) .",
    "equation ( 23 ) shows that flexing of the crust results in a _ lower frequency _ than what would be expected if the ocean floor were solid .      to simplify equations ( 15 ) , so that it can be solved analytically , we order the terms and drop those which are small .",
    "we first relate the ordering of the transverse and radial displacements within the crust .",

    "we solve for @xmath114 , and estimate the mode frequency using equation ( 21 ) , by demanding that @xmath59 be continuous across the ocean / crust boundary to avoid infinite radial accelerations .",

    "the two components which make up our ns envelope are a liquid ocean and a degenerate crystalline crust ( see figure 1 ) . for accreting nss , the composition of each of these components is determined by nuclear burning processes which occur on the surface , especially the rp - process during type i x - rays bursts ( wallace & woosely 1981 ; schatz et al . 1999 , 2002 ) and the hotter burning during superbursts ( cumming & bildsten 2001 ; schatz , bildsten & cumming 2003 ) .",

    "this decreases the energy needed for large mode amplitudes .",
    "the envelope profile is described by the equation of radiative transfer , which after substituting @xmath9 is @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the radiation constant and @xmath146 is the opacity .",
    "the opacity is set using electron - scattering ( paczyski 1983 ) , free - free ( clayton 1993 with the gaunt factor of schatz et al .",
    "1999 ) , and conductive opacities ( schatz et al .",
    "1999 using the basic form of yakovlev & urpin 1980 ) in the liquid region . in the crust",
    "we make no distinction and use the same conductive opacity .",
    "equation ( 39 ) is integrated starting at an outer column depth ( @xmath147 ) and into the envelope .",
    "the outer temperature is set near @xmath148 , a value for which the solutions are minimally sensitive because of their radiative zero nature ( schwarzschild 1958 , or see the discussion in piro & bildsten 2004 ) .",
    "previous studies of constantly accreting nss have shown that the interior thermal balance is set by electron captures , neutron emissions , and pycnonuclear reaction in the inner crust ( miralda - escud , paczyski & haensel 1990 ; bildsten & brown 1997 ; brown & bildsten 1998 ) which release @xmath149 ( haensel & zudunik 1990 ) .",
    "depending on the accretion rate and thermal structure of the crust , this energy will either be conducted into the core or released into the ocean such that for an eddington accretion rate up to @xmath150 of the energy is lost to the core and exists as neutrinos ( brown 2000 ) .",
    "we therefore set the flux in the ocean to a fiducial value of @xmath151 ( as expected for an accretion rate of @xmath152 , about one - tenth the eddington rate ) .",
    "we solve for @xmath131 using the analytic equation of state from paczyski ( 1983 ) which is applicable to both the ocean and crust .",
    "the profiles are continuous across the ocean / crust interface because we assume the same conductive opacity in each region .",
    "figure 2 shows the envelope profile for the variables most important for determining the mode properties .",
    "the dashed line denotes the location of the crust ( which we assume is at a column depth of @xmath153 , near a density of @xmath154 ) .      using the envelope profile of  4.1 , we numerically solve for the interface wave eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies .",
    "we treat each integration as a two eigenvalue shooting problem , first choosing @xmath23 and @xmath91 and then shooting for the bottom boundary condition .",
    "we integrate equations ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) , beginning at the top of the ocean at a column of @xmath155 ( where the unstable burning of x - ray bursts typically occurs ; bildsten 1998 ) where we set @xmath52 .",
    "the boundary conditions at the ocean / crust interface are set by requiring @xmath58 to be continuous , @xmath60 ( which sets @xmath156 ) , and @xmath59 continuous across the boundary ( which sets @xmath117 ) .",
    "the discontinuity of @xmath92 is set using @xmath91 .",
    "we then integrate equations ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) into the ns crust ( we assume that @xmath157 and simply set @xmath158 for these examples ) down to a depth within the crust where we require both @xmath92 and @xmath58 to be zero .",
    "we leave the bottom boundary depth as a free parameter and study how the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions change with this variable .    in figure 3",
    "we show example eigenfunctions with a bottom boundary at @xmath159 . on the same plot",
    "we also compare the analytic eigenfunctions from  3.2 and appendix b. these use the numeric envelope model to set the local scale height and @xmath160 ( its value at the ocean / crust boundary ) to set the eigenvalues .",
    "the numerical eigenvalues are @xmath161 and @xmath162 , which are close to the analytic values of @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , the radial displacement is found to be very large at the interface , relative to its value at the ocean surface .",
    "the energy density ( per logarithm of pressure ) is @xmath165 where @xmath166 , which shows where the mode `` lives . ''",
    "the energy density is also strongly concentrated at the interface , consistent with the result that the mode s properties are set by the envelope at this depth .    as a comparison , we plot @xmath58 for both the correct and the `` solid '' ocean / crustal boundary conditions in figure 4 . for the latter",
    "we find a frequency of @xmath167 .",
    "the linear plot of the amplitudes shows how extreme the radial displacement is at the crust for the interface mode .",
    "we omit comparing @xmath92 and the energy density for the modes since they are almost identical in the ocean .",
    "to study the dependence of the mode s properties on the bottom boundary condition within the crust , we compare the numeric and analytic results as a function of the bottom boundary depth , @xmath168 , in figure 5 . on the left hand side",
    "is the limit when there is no penetration into the crust , in this case both the ratio @xmath169 and @xmath91 are zero and @xmath170 , the values which would be approximated for a shallow surface wave ( see figure 4 ) . as the bottom boundary is set deeper , the frequency decreases , becoming nearly , but not quite equal to @xmath171 .",
    "we have discussed the ocean / crust interface wave , investigating its properties both analytically and numerically for a two - component ns envelope .",
    "we show that it can be understood as a shallow surface wave , with a different radial displacement boundary condition at the bottom of the ocean .",
    "this reduces the frequency by roughly @xmath172 from what would be expected if the crust were instead `` solid . '' in general the interface wave is a global mode of oscillation , so that the entire star must be taken into account to calculate the mode to high precision ( see discussion in appendix c ) .",
    "fortunately , by using our analysis , a fairly good estimate of the mode frequency can be made just from considering the ns properties right near the ocean / crust interface because the majority of mode energy ( @xmath173 ) resides in the ns ocean .",
    "the interface wave should be included in future studies of nonradial oscillations on both accreting and bursting nss . for a non - rotating ns this would result in frequencies of @xmath174 which",
    "would then be altered and split due to the ns spin ( bildsten , ushomirsky & cutler 1996 ) .",
    "the observation of multiple mode periods would greatly assist our understanding of the ns crust .",
    "the g - modes are sensitive to the depth of the crust ( since it provides a bottom boundary ) , while the interface wave is sensitive to both the depth and the value of the shear modulus .",
    "this provides information about the temperature and composition of the crust , which is determined by unstable nuclear burning processes ( x - ray bursts and superbursts ) that happen in the ocean .",
    "since the example considered in this work is a relatively `` cool '' envelope , the g - mode frequencies ( @xmath133 ) are well separated from the interface wave frequency ( @xmath174 ) . on a bursting ns , which has temperatures in the upper atmosphere as high as @xmath175 ,",
    "at least one g - mode has a frequency higher than the interface wave .",
    "the interface wave would then have an additional node in its eigenfunction , due to the relation between g - mode frequency ordering and number of nodes , but its frequency would be unchanged as long as the ocean stays at a temperature of @xmath176 ( since this is where the mode s energy is concentrated ) .",
    "woosley et al . ( 2004 ) show that the thermal wave during an x - ray burst does not penetrate deeply into the ocean , so that our estimates for the interface mode frequency still hold .",
    "the other important astrophysical context where our work can be applied is for old and/or massive wds that have crystalline cores .",
    "this may be seen in the pulsations of bpm 37093 ( kanaan et al .",
    "1992 ) , a high - mass zz ceti star that should be considerably crystallized ( winget et al .",
    "there is also the exciting possibility that some of the pulsators discovered through the sloan digital sky survey ( mukadam et al .",
    "2004 ) may be massive enough to be crystallized .",
    "scaling equation ( 37 ) to the fiducial interior properties of a @xmath177 wd , we find a crustal mode period of @xmath178^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which for the @xmath179 mode is between the periods of the f - mode ( @xmath180 ) and g - modes ( @xmath181 ) .",
    "hv79 ( and more recently montgomery & winget 1999 ) previously calculated the spectrum of g - modes and torsional modes expected for these stars , concentrating on the effects of crystallization .",
    "hv79 do not single out any one mode as a `` crustal mode , '' but in their crystallized models their lowest order g - mode ( which they denote @xmath182 ) matches many of the properties we identify as being characteristic of a crustal mode .",
    "this includes a large radial displacement at the crust and a nearly constant transverse displacement in the wd `` ocean '' ( see figures 1 and 2 of hv79 ) .",
    "furthermore , hv79 find the period of their @xmath182 mode to be between the f - mode and the other g - mode periods , in confirmation of our above discussion .",
    "we thank both phil arras and omer blaes for helpful discussions .",
    "we also thank the referee , michael montgomery , for pointing out the hv79 paper and its relevance to our work .",
    "this work was supported by the national science foundation under grants phy99 - 07949 and ast02 - 05956 , and by the joint institute for nuclear astrophysics through nsf grant phy02 - 16783 .",
    "the interface wave s properties are set by how it is influenced by the finite shear modulus of the ns crust .",
    "unlike g - modes , which see the crust as solid , the interface wave reacts to the crust as if it is a flexible and compressible surface .",
    "we now explain why each of these cases occur .    using @xmath41 , and assuming that @xmath157 , equations ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) can be rewritten as @xmath183          \\nonumber          \\\\          & & + ik_x\\frac{d\\xi_x}{dz}\\left ( \\frac{\\mu_0}{3 } + \\gamma_1 \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath184 the simplest analysis of these equations arises when perturbations scale like @xmath185 and dispersion relations are in the wkb limit ( when the radial wavenumber @xmath186 ) . this results in toroidal and spheroidal modes with frequencies @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the total wavenumber .",

    "these imply that a g - mode with a frequency of @xmath133 ( bc95 ) will be reflected at the interface because of the frequency mismatch .",
    "unfortunately , this analysis can not be extended to the interface mode because it has @xmath192 , in contradiction to the wkb limit .    to see that a mode with a constant transverse velocity ( like the interface wave ) is not excluded from the crust we compare the transverse momentum terms from equation ( 9 ) .",
    "the shear modulus term has two pieces , the larger one is @xmath193 .",
    "this term strongly affects the mode s eigenfunctions when it is comparable to the transverse acceleration of the mode , @xmath194 . using @xmath195",
    "this implies a critical shear modulus of @xmath196 . in the case of g - modes @xmath197 and @xmath198 so that the critical modulus is ( bc95 ) @xmath199 substituting values near the ocean / crust interface for degenerate , relativistic electrons , @xmath200 which is clearly less than the value of @xmath39 from equation ( 6 ) , implying that the g - modes will be excluded from the crust .",
    "one the other hand , the interface wave has a constant transverse velocity so that @xmath201 . using @xmath202",
    ", the interface wave has a critical shear modulus of @xmath203 which is just the actual shear modulus present at the boundary , so the wave must penetrate the crust .",
    "this shows that in the interface wave the transverse momentum is perfectly balanced by the shear stress , so that the ocean / crust boundary behaves like a flexible and compressible surface .",
    "to estimate the transverse crustal eigenfunction , we order the terms from equation ( a2 ) and drop those which are small . using equations ( 24 ) and ( 26 )",
    "we first relate the ordering of the transverse and radial displacements within the curst . dividing equation ( a2 ) through by @xmath58 , multiplying through by @xmath204 and using the above relations , the ordering of each of the terms are @xmath205 the size of these quantities",

    "we substitute the eigenfunction for @xmath58 , equation ( 28 ) into equation ( b2 ) to solve for @xmath92 .",
    "the two constants of integration are set by imposing that @xmath60 at the top of the crust and that @xmath92 ( just like @xmath58 ) goes to zero at @xmath110 , so that @xmath208                          + \\beta\\left[\\left(\\frac{s_{\\rm b}}{s}\\right)^2 - 1\\right]\\right .",
