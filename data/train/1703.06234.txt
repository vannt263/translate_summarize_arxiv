    "spin - dependent scattering has played important roles in many fields of physics for a long time",
    ". spin - dependent asymmetric scattering of electron beams in vacuum provided a foundation of relativistic quantum mechanics  @xcite . in condensed matter physics , spin - orbit scattering of electrons propagating in solids contributes to some transport phenomena  @xcite .",
    "for example , spin - dependent impurity scattering caused by spin - orbit scattering is among the origins of anomalous hall effect and ( extrinsic ) spin hall effect  @xcite .",
    "another direct consequence of spin - orbit scattering is rotation of electron spin , changing interference between wave functions of electrons around an impurity .",
    "this effect on quantum interference is known as the origin of weak anti - localization  @xcite .",
    "interference of wave functions results in a periodic modulation of the local density of states ( ldos ) .",
    "this modulation , known as quasiparticle interference ( qpi ) , has been imaged by spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy ( si - stm ) in a wide variety of materials  @xcite .",
    "qpi has been studied mostly to acquire momentum - resolved information of electronic states from its characteristic periodicity based on an assumption that the scattering center is a scalar one .",
    "this assumption is widely used even for strong spin - orbit coupling systems  @xcite where spin - orbit scattering is also likely to be strong .",
    "however , the role of spin - orbit scattering in qpi is obscure .",
    "a primal difference between spin - orbit and scalar scattering is that the former depends on both spin and momentum of electrons whereas the latter does not .",
    "consequently , spin - orbit scattering can cause additional enhancement or suppression of qpi that is unanticipated for scalar scattering .",
    "et al_. theoretically indicate that spin - orbit scattering enhances new scattering channels for the surface states of topological insulator bi@xmath1te@xmath2  @xcite . in the experiments ,",
    "however , such enhancement and resultant multiple branches of qpi have never been observed  @xcite .    in this paper , exploiting atomic - resolution si - stm and numerical simulations , we reveal that spin - orbit scattering is predominant for qpi of the quasi - two - dimensional states of a polar semiconductor bitei .",
    "we performed a detailed analysis of qpi using the standard @xmath0-matrix formalism with an extended technique to accelerate calculations including not only momentum - independent scalar scattering but also momentum - dependent spin - orbit scattering .",
    "all the components of qpi observed by the experiments are successfully reproduced when spin - orbit scattering is considered .",
    "the key ingredient is the selection rule due to spin - orbit scattering , which selectively enhances one of the main scattering channels contributing qpi of bitei .",
    "our finding demonstrates that spin - orbit scattering is actually observed in qpi and provides a foothold to get better insight into the electronic states through qpi .",
    "bitei has a polar crystal structure with layered stacking of triple layers composed of te , bi , and i layers , and hosts giant rashba - type spin splitting in bulk bands as well as at the surface as observed by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes )  @xcite . a domain structure composed of opposite stacking orders",
    "is found in this material , resulting in two kinds of termination at a single surface  @xcite . especially in the te - terminated areas , differential conductance ( @xmath3 ) images show clear qpi of quasi - two - dimensional states split off from the bulk valence band by the spontaneous electric polarization  @xcite .",

    "spin directions are depicted by the arrows and markers colored in orange and blue ; in - plane components are denoted by the arrows and out - of - plane components are denoted by the markers . ]    to define points to be focused , we briefly summarize qpi of bitei .",

    "figure  [ fig : exp](a ) shows a typical image of qpi in the te - terminated area . the fourier - transformed image shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp](b ) reveals that the qpi patterns consist of three major components : the hexagonal ring surrounding the @xmath7 point , the strong peaks in the @xmath7-@xmath8 direction , and the outermost humps in the @xmath7-@xmath8 direction .",
    "these features are commonly observed in all samples studied . by comparing qpi dispersions with the arpes results ,  @xcite the hexagonal ring and the strong peaks",
    "are assigned to interband scattering between the spin - split bands and intraband scattering between the corners of the hexagonally warped outer branch , respectively , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp](c ) .",
    "the outermost humps change their locations depending on bias voltages for stabilizing the scanning tip , and therefore are attributed to the so - called setpoint effect discussed later .",
    "the near-@xmath7 feature , which varies from one sample to another , originates from nanometer - scale inhomogeneity due to random distribution of defects .",
    "although the positions of the hexagonal ring and the strong @xmath7-@xmath8 peaks are understood as described above , there remains a puzzle in their intensities .",
    "the intraband scattering is mostly forbidden because the backscattering from @xmath9 to @xmath10 is suppressed due to the anti - parallel spin orientations .",
    "the @xmath7-@xmath8 peaks are nevertheless allowed because of deviation from the backscattering . meanwhile , the interband scattering giving the hexagonal ring is always allowed because the spin orientations are almost parallel .",
    "that is , the spin texture of the band structure is more beneficial for the hexagonal ring than for the @xmath7-@xmath8 peaks , although the former is actually weaker than the latter .",
    "this inverted intensity is a robust signature of spin - orbit scattering , as revealed below .",

    "in fact , there are many defects in the field of view of fig .",
    "[ fig : exp](a ) .",
    "however , the three major features of qpi are independent of details of defect distribution as evidenced by the experimental fact that they are observed in all samples . therefore , we postulate that multiple impurities work on overall intensity in a statistical manner  @xcite and a single impurity is a good starting point to discuss qpi patterns .",
    "the ldos is written by the retarded green s function @xmath49 in momentum space , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the fourier transform of the ldos , @xmath52 . here",

    "the enormous amount of calculation has hindered precise and comprehensive analysis of qpi ; calculations have often been done only in a narrow range and at a low resolution of energy and momentum  @xcite .",
    "we find that the fft - based technique is still available for momentum - dependent scattering satisfying a certain condition . because of this method",
    ", the amount of calculation for spin - orbit scattering can be reduced to @xmath65 that greatly accelerates our simulations .",

    "we begin our simulations with a scalar impurity . in this case , the scattering potential is independent of momentum , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is strength of scattering ( @xmath69  ev for all simulations ) .",
    "the @xmath0 matrix is also simplified to a momentum - independent form .",
    "this simplification makes the calculation greatly easy and is why a scalar impurity is widely assumed as scattering center .",

    "the preferential enhancement of the @xmath7-@xmath8 peaks ( fig .",

    "( whether the scattering amplitude is zero or not is easily estimated as written in appendix  [ appendix : amplitudeandspin ] . )",

    "such candidates are found in topological crystalline insulators and weyl semimetals  @xcite .",
    "including other factors affecting qpi intensities would be conducive to better quantifying strength of spin - orbit scattering .",
    "a delta - function scattering potential is used for simplicity in our simulations . in a more realistic case , @xmath68 in eq .",
    "is changed from a constant to @xmath106 for a spherical scattering potential .",
    "since @xmath106 usually decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath107 , qpi intensities are prone to be suppressed at large @xmath107 , where the amplitude of spin - orbit scattering is large .",
    "finite sharpness of a scanning tip also causes a similar effect .",
    "strength of spin - orbit scattering therefore may be underestimated due to these factors .",
    "nevertheless , the strength of spin - orbit scattering obtained for bitei ( 80  @xmath4 ) is much larger than a theoretical value for @xmath61-gaas ( 5.3  @xmath4 ) ,  @xcite being consistent with strong spin - orbit coupling in bitei .",
    "we note that the obtained value is averaged over many defects of multiple kinds .",
    "if defects are separated enough , spin - orbit scattering can be probed at individual defects and may be available for designing and optimizing materials of spin hall effect .",
    "in conclusion , using atomic - resolution si - stm and numerical simulations with the @xmath0-matrix formalism , we identify a signature of spin - orbit scattering in the qpi patterns of bitei .",
    "spin - orbit scattering manifests itself in qpi through a selection rule originating from the scattering amplitude .",
    "our results highlight the importance of the scattering process beyond featureless scalar scattering and , more importantly , suggest a potential capability of qpi measurement as a local , direct ( unaffected by scattering time ) , and quantitative probe of spin - orbit scattering detected heretofore by transport measurements .",
