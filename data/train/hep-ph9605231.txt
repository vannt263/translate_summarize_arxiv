    "v=^0,^0 , ^0,j/ , [ eq:1.1 ] at high energy @xmath5 offers a unique possibility of studying the pomeron exchange at high energies @xcite .",
    "particularly important is the observation that the transverse size of the photon shrinks with the increase of its virtuality @xmath19 .",
    "this property can conveniently be quantified in the mixed @xmath20 lightcone technique @xcite , in which the high energy hadrons and photons are described as systems of color dipoles with the transverse size @xmath21 frozen during the interaction process .",
    "interaction of color dipoles with the target nucleon is quantified by the color dipole cross section @xmath22 whose evolution with the energy @xmath5 is described by the generalized bfkl equation @xcite ( for a related approach see also @xcite ) .",
    "the shrinkage of the photon with @xmath19 together with the small - size behavior of the dipole cross section ( @xmath23 ) leads to what has come to be known as a _ scanning phenomenon _ @xcite : the @xmath6 vector meson production amplitude is dominated by the contribution from the dipole cross section at the dipole size @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the scanning radius r_s .",
    "[ eq:1.2 ] this scanning property makes the vector meson production an ideal laboratory for testing the generalized bfkl dynamics [ gbfkl hereafter ] . at large @xmath19 and/or for heavy vector mesons , the amplitude of reaction ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) becomes short - distance dominated and is perturbatively calculable in terms of the short - distance behavior of the vector mesons wave function .",
    "however , the asymptotic short distance formulas @xcite are not yet applicable at the moderate @xmath26gev@xmath27 of interest in the present fixed target and hera experiments where the scanning radius @xmath25 is still large due to a large scale parameter @xmath28 in ( [ eq:1.2 ] ) as derived in @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "the onset of the short - distance dominance is very slow and there emerges a unique possibility of studying the transition between the soft and hard interaction regimes in a well controlled manner .",
    "furthermore , the scanning phenomenon allows to directly test the steeper subasymptotic energy dependence of the dipole cross section at smaller dipole size @xmath29 , which is one of interesting consequences of the color dipole gbfkl dynamics @xcite .",
    "the scanning phenomenon has particularly interesting implications for the diffractive production of the @xmath3 radially excited vector mesons ^*pvp ,  v(2s)=, , ,, .. [ eq:1.3 ] here one encounters the node effect : a tricky and strong cancellation between the large and the small size contributions to the production amplitude i.e. , those above and below the node position @xmath30 in the @xmath3 radial wave function @xcite respectively .",
    "the node effect is the only dynamical mechanism that gives a strong natural suppression of the photoproduction of excited vector mesons @xmath7 vs. @xmath6 mesons .",
    "for instance , it correctly predicted @xcite the strong suppression of real photoproduction of the @xmath31 compared to the @xmath32 observed in the nmc experiment @xcite and confirmed recently in the high statistics e687 experiment @xcite . in anticipation of the new experimental data on real and virtual @xmath33 photoproduction from hera , it is important to further explore the salient features of the node effect in the framework of the color dipole gbfkl dynamics . at moderate @xmath19 ,",
    "the scanning radius @xmath25 is comparable to @xmath30 .",
    "first , for this reason even a slight variation of @xmath25 with @xmath19 leads to a strong change of the cancellation pattern in the @xmath7 production amplitude and to an anomalous @xmath19 dependence for the electroproduction of the radially excited vector mesons @xcite .",
    "second , the cancellation pattern is sensitive also to the dipole - size dependence of the color dipole cross section @xmath22 which in the gbfkl dynamics changes which energy @xmath5 leading to an anomalous energy dependence for producing the @xmath7 vector mesons as compared to a smooth energy dependence for the @xmath6 ground state vector mesons .",
    "this anomalous @xmath19 and energy dependence of the @xmath7 production offers a unique signature of the @xmath3 radial excitation vs. the d - wave state .",
    "third , at very small @xmath19 , the @xmath7 production amplitude can be of opposite sign with respect to that of the @xmath6 production amplitude ( the overcompensation scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite ) to then conform to the same sign at larger @xmath19 ( the undercompensation scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "we wish to emphasize that the relative sign of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 production amplitudes is experimentally measurable using the so - called sding - pumplin effect ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we develop the color dipole phenomenology of diffractive photo- and electroproduction of the @xmath35 ground state and of the @xmath3 radially excited vector mesons . as stated above , for a large scanning radius",
    ", the large distance contribution to the production amplitude is not yet negligibly small in the so far experimentally studied region of @xmath19 , in particular in the @xmath3 meson production . in this paper",
    "we show that the @xmath19 and energy dependence of the diffractive production of vector mesons offers a unique possibility of studying how the color dipole cross section changes from the large nonperturbative to the small perturbative dipole size .",
    "the problem can be attacked both ways .",
    "first , we present detailed predictions using the color dipole cross section @xcite , which gives a very good quantitative description of the proton structure function from very small to large @xmath19 .",
    "second , we can invert the problem and evaluate the color dipole cross section from the corresponding experimental data . such an evaluation of the dipole cross section is presented here for the first time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we formulate the color dipole factorization for vector meson production amplitudes . in section 3",
    "we present our numerical results .",
    "we find good agreement with the experimental data from the fixed target and hera collider experiments .",
    "the subject of section 4 is the anomalous @xmath19 and energy dependence of electroproduction of @xmath3 radially excited vector mesons . in section 5",
    "we discuss the scaling relations between production cross sections for different vector mesons and the restoration of flavor symmetry in the variable @xmath8 .",
    "we comment on how the scanning phenomenon enables a direct comparison of the spatial wave functions of the @xmath9 and @xmath36 mesons .",
    "the first evaluation of the dipole cross section from the experimental data is presented in section 6 . in section 7",
    "we summarize our main results and conclusions . in the appendix",
    "we describe the lightcone parameterization of wave functions of @xmath6 and @xmath37 vector mesons used in our analysis .",
    "the fock state expansion for the relativistic meson starts with the quark - antiquark state which can be considered as a color dipole .",
    "the relevant variables are the dipole moment @xmath38 which is the transverse separation ( with respect to the collision axis ) of the quark and antiquark and @xmath39 - the fraction of the lightcone momentum of the meson carried by a quark .",
    "the interaction of the relativistic color dipole with the target nucleon is described by the energy dependent color dipole cross section @xmath22 .",
    "the many gluon contributions of higher fock states @xmath40 become very important at high energy @xmath5 .",
    "the crucial point is that in the leading log@xmath41 the effect of higher fock states can be reabsorbed into the energy dependence of @xmath22 , which satisfies the generalized bfkl equation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the flavor blind ( one should really say _ flavor tasteless _ )",
    "dipole cross section unifies the description of various diffractive processes .",
    "to apply the color dipole formalism to deep inelastic and quarkonium scattering and diffractive production of vector mesons one needs the probability amplitudes @xmath42 and @xmath43 to find the color dipole of size @xmath29 in the photon and quarkonium ( vector meson ) , respectively .",
    "the color dipole distribution in ( virtual ) photons was derived in @xcite . in terms of these probability amplitudes ,",
    "the imaginary part of the virtual photoproduction of vector mesons in the forward direction ( @xmath44 ) reads = v|(,r)|^*=_0 ^ 1 dz d^2*r*(,r ) _",
    "v^*(*r*,z ) _",
    "^*(*r*,z ) [ eq:2.2 ] whose normalization is @xmath45 for small size heavy quarkonium the probability amplitude @xmath46 can safely be identified with the constituent quark - antiquark quarkonium wave function .",
    "the color dipole factorization ( [ eq:2.2 ] ) takes advantage of the diagonalization of the scattering matrix in the @xmath20 representation , which clearly holds even when the dipole size @xmath21 is large , i.e. beyond the perturbative region of short distances . due to this property and to the fact",
    "that in leading log@xmath41 the effect of higher fock states is reabsorbed in the energy dependence of the dipole cross section @xmath22 , as a starting approximation we can identify the probability amplitude @xmath43 for large size dipoles in light vector mesons with the constituent quark wave function of the meson .",
    "this provides a viable phenomenology of diffractive scattering which is purely perturbative for small size mesons and/or large @xmath19 and small scanning radius @xmath25 and allows a sensible interpolation between soft interactions for large dipoles and hard perturbative interactions of small dipoles . for light quarkonia and small @xmath19",
    ", this implies the assumption that small - size constituent quarks are the relevant degrees of freedom and the spatial separation of constituent quarks is a major dynamical variable in the scattering process .",
    "the large-@xmath29 contribution to the production amplitude ( [ eq:3.1 ] ) depends on the both dipole cross section for large - size dipoles and the amplitudes of distribution of large - size color dipoles and/or the nonperturbative wave functions of light vector mesons at large @xmath29 , both of which are poorly known at the moment .",
    "still , testing the predictions from such a minimal model is interesting for its own sake and can shed a light on the transition between the soft and hard scattering regimes which is still far from understood .",
    "an analysis of sensitivity to models of the nonperturbative wave functions of vector mesons and of how one can disentangle the effects of large @xmath29 behavior of the wave function and of the dipole cross section , goes beyond the scope of the present exploratory study .",
    "the energy dependence of the dipole cross section is quantified in terms of the dimensionless rapidity @xmath47 , which in deep inelastic scattering equals @xmath48 .",
    "considerations of intermediate masses in diagrams for exclusive production of vector mesons show that to the considered leading log@xmath41 approximation one must take @xmath49 , where x_eff= q^2+m_v^22m_p , [ eq:2.3 ] and @xmath50 is a mass of the vector meson .",
    "the pomeron exchange dominance holds when the regge parameter is large , = 1x_eff=2m_p(q^2+m_v^2)1 .",
    "[ eq:3.1 ] hereafter we write the amplitudes in terms of @xmath51 .",
    "the spin independence of the dipole cross section @xmath51 in ( [ eq:2.2 ] ) leads to the @xmath52-channel helicity conservation : the transversely polarized photons produce transversely polarized vector mesons and the longitudinally polarized vector mesons are produced by longitudinal ( to be more precise , the scalar one ) photons . more explicitly , the form of the forward production amplitudes for the transversely ( t ) and the longitudinally ( l ) polarized vector mesons in terms of the lightcone radial wave function @xmath53 of the @xmath54 fock state of the vector meson reads @xcite _ t(x_eff , q^2)= n_cc_v ( 2)^2   + d^2*r * ( x_eff , r ) _ 0 ^ 1dz z(1-z)\\ { m_q^2 k_0(r ) ( r , z)- [ z^2+(1-z)^2]k_1(r)_r ( r , z ) } + = 1 ( m_v^2+q^2)^2 w_t(q^2,r^2 ) [ eq:2.4 ] _",

    "we show only the leading @xmath19 dependence , suppressing the phenomenologically important departure form the law @xmath80 , whose large @xmath19 dependence can be related to scaling violations in the gluon density ( see ( [ eq:2.8 ] ) and the discussion below ) .",
    "we recall that the shrinkage of the virtual photons and/or the decrease of the scanning radius @xmath25 with @xmath19 is the origin of color transparency effects in diffractive leptoproduction of vector mesons off nuclei @xcite .",

    "for this reason , in the undercompensation regime the destructive interference of the two contributions becomes weaker at higher energy and we predict a growth of the @xmath182 cross section ratios with energy . taking only the pure pomeron contributions into account , we find for the forward cross section ratio @xmath239 at @xmath240  gev , which at hera energies increases to 0.063 and 0.071 at @xmath214gev and @xmath241gev , respectively .",
