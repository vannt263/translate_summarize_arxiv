    "therefore , up to homeomorphism , we may assume @xmath211 and @xmath212 are two generators of the torus .",
    "view @xmath211 and @xmath212 as two edges of a graph with one vertex @xmath33 embedded in the torus . the only face of this embedding has facial walk of @xmath213 which is a @xmath25-gon . the vertex @xmath33 appears on this facial walk four times .",
    "we may technically call these four appearance of @xmath33 as @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "we can only connect @xmath216 with @xmath217 , or @xmath218 with @xmath215 to embed the third loop @xmath219 .",
    "after @xmath219 is embedded , there is no other way to embed any nonhomotopic loop inside the face @xmath50 .",
    "therefore lemma 4.2 is true .    ' '' ''    * proof of theorem  [ thm-4 - 1]*. let @xmath2 be a graph embedded in the torus with embedding @xmath220 . by lemmas  [ lem-2 - 1 ] and [ lem-2 - 2 ] we may assume that @xmath39 contains a spanning disk @xmath58 which contains all vertices of @xmath2 and is bounded by a cycle @xmath32 of @xmath2 .",
    "all edges not contained in @xmath58 are essential edges . if we contract @xmath58 to a point , then each essential edge is a noncontractable loop of the torus . by lemma  [ lem-4 - 2 ]",
    "all essential edges are partitioned into at most three homotopy classes .",
    "certainly it is easier to find the thickness and outerthickness for toroidal embeddings with one or two homotopy classes of essential edges than with three homotopy classes .",
    "therefore we may assume that all three classes are not empty and they are embedded in the torus as shown in figure  [ torus ] .        in order to partition",
    "the edge set of @xmath2 into three outerplanar graphs , our strategy is to choose a spanning supergraph of @xmath58 ( @xmath58 with some essential edges ) as a planar graph and then partition this planar graph into two outerplanar graphs , and use the remaining edges ( all contained in @xmath61 ) as the third outerplanar subgraph .",
    "let @xmath221 and @xmath222 be these three sets of essential edges with @xmath223 for some @xmath224 and @xmath225 . then @xmath226 .",
    "all endvertices of essential edges are contained in the cycle @xmath32 in the clockwise order : @xmath227 @xmath228 .",
    "it is possible that @xmath229 and/or @xmath230 .    for @xmath231 let @xmath232 be the graph consisting of edges in @xmath233 .",

    "we make some reductions .",
    "we may delete all the internal vertices of @xmath88 with degree one since adding a pendant edge to a graph does not increase the outerplanar thickness .",
    "such deletions can be performed successfully .",
    "an internal vertex of degree more than two must be incident to some pendant edges .",
    "so we may suppose that all internal vertices of @xmath88 are of degree two .",
    "if @xmath88 contains some internal vertices then all internal vertices form a path joining @xmath242 to @xmath243 , or @xmath242 to @xmath244 , or @xmath245 to @xmath243 , or @xmath245 to @xmath244 exclusively . in this case",
    "we have ( i ) @xmath236 and @xmath238 , ( ii ) @xmath88 is a path , and ( iii ) @xmath246 is homeomorphic to a cylinder .",
    "if @xmath88 does not contain any internal vertices , then @xmath88 contains two essential edges @xmath247 and @xmath248 for which @xmath249 and @xmath243 may coincide and/or @xmath245 and @xmath244 may coincide .",
    "if @xmath236 and @xmath238 then @xmath88 contains two disjoint edges @xmath247 and @xmath248 , with a possible third edge @xmath250 or @xmath251 , and @xmath246 is homeomorphic to a cylinder . if @xmath252 and @xmath253 , then @xmath88 consists of only one single essential edge @xmath247 . if @xmath252 and @xmath254 or @xmath236 and @xmath253 , then @xmath88 consists of two essential edges forming a path of length two , and @xmath246 is homeomorphic to a degenerate cylinder .",
    "if @xmath88 consists of only two disjoint edges , we add a new edge @xmath255 to connect these two edges to make the new @xmath88 again a path .",

    "if one of @xmath256 and @xmath257 , say @xmath246 , is homeomorphic to a cylinder ( not a degenerate cylinder , i.e. , @xmath236 and @xmath238 ) , then @xmath258 and @xmath259 .",
    "hence @xmath234 and @xmath235 can possibly have at most two common vertices which are @xmath260 (= @xmath261 ) and @xmath262 (= @xmath263 ) . by the structure of @xmath234 and @xmath235 ( similar to @xmath88 , since each is a path ) , @xmath264 is the union of two paths that have up to two common vertices , hence is outerplanar . since @xmath265 is a planar graph , by gonalves @xcite ,",
    "@xmath266 can be partitioned into two outerplanar subgraphs @xmath267 and @xmath268 .",
    "therefore @xmath2 can be partitioned into three outerplanar graphs @xmath269 and @xmath264 .",
    "if none of @xmath256 and @xmath257 is homeomorphic to a cylinder , then @xmath270 , is either a single edge or a path of length 2 . clearly @xmath264 is an outerplanar graph , and by similar reasoning , @xmath2 can be partitioned into three outerplanar graphs .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem  [ thm-4 - 1 ] .    ' '' ''",

    "this is certainly an interesting question after concalves confirmed chartrand et al.s conjecture .",
    "while no counterexample has been found , it seems much more difficult to show that all projective planar graphs have outerthickness @xmath3 because all nonplanar and projective planar graphs have thickness @xmath3 .",
    "also there is even no statement to claim the thickness of the projective plane is @xmath3 .",
    "we are able to show that the thickness of the projective plane and the klein bottle both are @xmath3 and the outerthickness of the klein bottle is @xmath4 .",
