    "today , 30 years after the pioneering work by larson ( 1981 ) , observations and simulations of the interstellar medium ( ism ) are revealing its turbulent nature with higher and higher fidelity ( see , e.g. , elmegreen & scalo 2004 ; mckee & ostriker 2007 ; romeo et al .",
    "a fundamental aspect of ism turbulence is the existence of scaling relations between the mass column density ( @xmath0 ) , the 1d velocity dispersion ( @xmath1 ) , and the size of the region over which such quantities are measured ( @xmath2 ) : @xmath3 the values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and the range of scales spanned by @xmath2 depend on which ism component we consider . in this paper",
    "we focus on cold interstellar gas , which is highly supersonic and hence strongly compressible , and which is known to play an important role in the gravitational instability of galactic discs ( e.g. , lin & shu 1966 ; jog & solomon 1984a , b ; bertin & romeo 1988 , and references therein ) .    in the molecular gas , @xmath6 ,",
    "the scaling exponents are @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and eq .",
    "( 1 ) holds up to scales of a few 100 pc .",
    "in fact , both galactic and extragalactic giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) are fairly well described by larson s scaling laws , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , although the uncertainties are still large ( e.g. , larson 1981 ; solomon et al .  1987 ; bolatto et al .  2008 ; heyer et al .",

    "the scaling exponents are instead @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and eq .",
    "( 1 ) seems to hold up to scales of a few kpc .",
    "a kolmogorov scaling for both @xmath1 and @xmath0 is suggested by the observed power spectra of hi intensity fluctuations , and is also consistent with other measurements ( e.g. , lazarian & pogosyan 2000 ; elmegreen et al .",

    "note , however , that the uncertainties are larger than in the @xmath6 case .",
    "for example , high - resolution simulations of supersonic turbulence suggest a burgers scaling for both @xmath1 and @xmath0 , i.e.  @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( e.g. , fleck 1996 ; kowal & lazarian 2007 ; kowal et al .  2007 ; kritsuk et al .  2007 ; schmidt et al .  2008 ; price & federrath 2010 ) .",
    "other recent simulation surveys suggest that the scaling exponent @xmath4 is significantly affected by turbulence forcing ( federrath et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ) and self - gravity ( collins et al .",
    "2012 ) .    in spite of such a burst of interest in ism turbulence , and in spite of the dynamical importance of cold interstellar gas ,",
    "there have been very few theoretical works aimed at evaluating the effect of turbulence on disc instability .",
    "in fact , traditional stability analyses do not take into account the scale - dependence of @xmath1 ( or @xmath0 ) , but identify @xmath1 with the typical 1d velocity dispersion observed at galactic scales .",
    "the first theoretical work devoted to the gravitational instability of turbulent gas discs was made by elmegreen ( 1996 ) , who assumed larson - type scaling relations [ see eq .",
    "( 1 ) ] and investigated the case @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "he found that the disc is always stable at large scales and unstable at small scales .",

    "they showed that turbulence has an important effect on the gravitational instability of the disc : it excites a rich variety of stability regimes , several of which have no classical counterpart .",
    "see in particular the ` _ _ stability map of turbulence _ _ ' ( fig .  1 of romeo et al .",

    ", there is an important interplay between stars and cold interstellar gas ( e.g. , agertz et al .",
    "2009 ; elmegreen 2011 ; forbes et al .  2011 ; cacciato et al .",
    "the gravitational coupling between these two components does not alter the form of the local stability criterion , @xmath17 , but makes the effective @xmath18 parameter different from both the stellar and the gaseous toomre ( 1964 ) parameters ( bertin & romeo 1988 ; romeo 1992 , 1994 ; elmegreen 1995 ; jog 1996 ; rafikov 2001 ; shen & lou 2003 ; elmegreen 2011 ; romeo & wiegert 2011 ) .",
    "the gravitational coupling between stars and gas also changes the least stable wavelength ( jog 1996 ) , among other diagnostics .    what is the effect of ism turbulence in this more realistic context ?",
    "the first published attempt to answer this question was made by shadmehri & khajenabi ( 2012 ) .",
    "they considered two - component discs of stars and turbulent gas , chose @xmath4 and @xmath5 so as to sample five of the seven stability regimes found by romeo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , and studied the dispersion relation numerically .",
    "their study suggests that turbulence has a significant effect on disc instability even when stars are taken into account .",
    "the goal of our paper is to answer the question above in detail , extending previous work along two directions :    1 .",
    "we perform a rigorous stability analysis of two - component turbulent discs , motivated by observations of ism turbulence in nearby galaxies . in particular , we consider two complementary cases : hi plus @xmath6 , and gas plus stars . in the first case , we examine the dispersion relation analytically , and illustrate how the gravitational coupling between hi and @xmath6 modifies the main stability regimes of gas turbulence , which were originally derived neglecting such a coupling ( romeo et al .",
    "2010 ) . in the second case , we show that there are four stability regimes of galactic interest , similar to those analysed above , but in only one of them do stars play a non - negligible role .",
    "we then focus on such a regime , and illustrate how gas turbulence affects the onset of gravitational instability in the disc , i.e.  the local stability threshold and the corresponding characteristic wavelength .",
    "we apply this analysis to a large sample of star - forming spirals from the hi nearby galaxy survey ( things ) , previously analysed by leroy et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and romeo & wiegert ( 2011 ) , and illustrate how ism turbulence affects a full set of stability diagnostics : the condition for star - gas decoupling , the effective @xmath18 parameter , and the least stable wavelength .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the ( in)stability of two - component turbulent discs is analysed in sect .  2 , our application to things spirals is shown in sect .",
    "3 , the relation between our results and those of shadmehri & khajenabi ( 2012 ) is discussed in sect .  4 , and the conclusions are drawn in sect .  5 .",
    "here we summarize some of the results found by romeo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , which are fundamental to a proper understanding of sects 2.22.4 .",
    "the dispersion relation of a turbulent and realistically thick gas disc is @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the frequency and the wavenumber of the perturbation , and @xmath22 is the epicyclic frequency . @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the mass column density and the 1d velocity dispersion measured over a region of size @xmath25 , as inferred from observations ( see , e.g. , elmegreen & scalo 2004 ; mckee & ostriker 2007 ; romeo et al .",
    "2010 ) : @xmath26 if the disc has volume density @xmath27 and scale height @xmath28 , then @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "the range @xmath30 corresponds to the case of 3d turbulence ( gmcs and hi at small scales ) , whereas the range @xmath32 corresponds to the case of 2d turbulence ( hi at large scales ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath33 introduced in eq .",
    "( 3 ) is the fiducial scale at which @xmath0 and @xmath1 are observed .",
    "this is also the scale at which the toomre parameter @xmath18 and other stability quantities are measured , so that @xmath34 .    the scaling exponents",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 have an important effect on the shape of the dispersion relation [ eq .",
    "( 2 ) ] , and hence on the condition for local gravitational instability ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "as @xmath4 and @xmath5 vary , turbulence drives the disc across seven stability regimes , three of which are densely populated by observations , simulations and models of galactic turbulence ( see fig .  1 of romeo et al .",
    "2010 ) :    * for @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( hereafter _ regime a _ ) , the stability of the disc is controlled by @xmath38 : the disc is stable at all scales if and only if @xmath39 , where @xmath40 depends on @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath41 .",
    "this is the domain of hi turbulence",
    ". both hi observations and high - resolution simulations of supersonic turbulence are consistent with the scaling @xmath42 . in such a case",
    ", the local stability criterion degenerates into @xmath43 , as if the disc were non - turbulent and infinitesimally thin . * for @xmath44 and @xmath37 ( hereafter _ regime c _ ) , the stability of the disc is no longer controlled by @xmath38 : the disc is always unstable at small scales ( i.e.  as @xmath45 ) and stable at large scales ( i.e.  as @xmath46 ) . * for @xmath47 and @xmath37 ( hereafter _ regime b _ ) , the disc is in a phase of transition between stability  la toomre ( regime a ) and instability at small scales ( regime c ) .",
    "this is the domain of @xmath6 turbulence .",
    "note , however , that even small deviations from larson s scaling laws can drive the disc into regime a or regime c , and thus have a strong impact on its gravitational instability .    ) plus @xmath6 in regime a ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) , regime b ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) , or regime c ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) . ]    since regimes a ",
    "c are fundamental to a proper understanding of sects 2.22.4 , we show them in fig .  1 .",
    "note , however , that this simple figure is not meant to be a substitute for fig .  1 of romeo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , which illustrates all seven stability regimes and their relation to the phenomenology of ism turbulence .",
    "until now we have considered hi and @xmath6 separately .",
    "how does the stability scenario change when hi and @xmath6 are considered together ? and how does it change when both gas and stars are taken into account ?",
    "we will answer these questions here and in sects 2.3 and 2.4 .    when hi and @xmath6 are considered together , their gravitational coupling changes how the disc responds to perturbations .",
    "the dispersion relation can be expressed in a form that is particularly useful for discussing the stability properties of the disc : @xmath54 where @xmath55 @xmath56 and @xmath57.-component turbulent disc is @xmath58 , as can easily be inferred from eq .",
    "( 22 ) of rafikov ( 2001 ) .",
    "this equation can not be expressed in a form similar to eq .",
    "( 4 ) , and will not be used in the rest of the paper . ]",
    "note that @xmath59 is the one - component dispersion relation for potential - density waves [ cf .",
    "( 2 ) ] , while @xmath60 describes sound waves modified by rotation ( and turbulence ) . since @xmath61 represents the self - gravity of component @xmath62 , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 4 ) measures the strength of gravitational coupling between the two components .",
    "eqs ( 4)(6 ) are also applicable to two - component discs of gas and stars , even though the stellar component is collisionless and non - turbulent .",
    "this is because stars can be accurately treated as a fluid when analysing the stability of galactic discs ( bertin & romeo 1988 ; rafikov 2001 ) , and because the equations above are valid whether each fluid is turbulent or not .",
    "remember , in fact , that the phenomenology of turbulence is encapsulated in @xmath63 and @xmath64 without altering the form of those equations .",
    "when the disc is made of gas ( g ) and stars ( @xmath65 ) , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are given by eq .",
    "( 3 ) , while the stellar quantities are not .",
    "@xmath68 is the reduced surface density , @xmath69 , where the @xmath21-dependent factor results from the finite scale height of the stellar layer ( vandervoort 1970 ; romeo 1992 , 1994 ; elmegreen 2011 ) .",
    "in contrast , @xmath70 is the radial velocity dispersion and does not depend on @xmath21 , since the pressure term in the dispersion relation is unaffected by disc thickness ( see again vandervoort 1970 ) .",
    "the gaseous and stellar toomre parameters are then defined as @xmath71 and @xmath72 .        as eq .",
    "( 4 ) is quadratic in @xmath73 , it can be solved with elementary methods .",
    "the discriminant is positive , so there are two real roots : @xmath74,\\ ] ] @xmath75 this means that the dispersion relation has two branches that do not cross , @xmath76 , except possibly as @xmath46 or @xmath45 .",
    "the functions @xmath77 satisfy two basic properties , which constrain the gravitational instability of the disc and generalize the stability constraints found in the classical two - component case ( jog & solomon 1984a ; bertin & romeo 1988 ) .",
    "such properties are stated and proved below , and can easily be visualized with the help of fig .  2 .",
    "the cases illustrated represent a disc made of marginally stable hi ( in regime a ) and unstable @xmath6 ( in regimes a  c ) .",
    "* _ property i : _",
    "@xmath78 lies below both @xmath79 and @xmath80 , i.e.  a two - component self - gravitating disc is more unstable ( or less stable ) than each component , whether this is turbulent or not .",
    "this can be proved by noting that @xmath81 is larger than @xmath82 , so that @xmath83 . in turn , this implies that @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the smallest @xmath86 for a given @xmath21 . *",
    "_ property ii : _",
    "@xmath87 is bounded by @xmath88 and @xmath89 , i.e.  this branch is always stable and represents sound waves modified by rotation ( and turbulence ) . to prove this , note that the inequality @xmath83 also implies that @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the largest @xmath86 for a given @xmath21 .",
    "note also that @xmath92 can not be smaller than @xmath93 or larger than @xmath94 , otherwise eq .",
    "( 4 ) would not hold .",
    "therefore it must be @xmath95 .      in sect .",
    "2.1 , we have summarized the main stability regimes of one - component turbulent discs .",
    "let us now extend the discussion to two - component discs of hi and @xmath6 , analysing three cases of galactic interest ( see again fig .",
    "the response of each component is driven by pressure at small scales and by rotation at large scales , while self - gravity acts more strongly at intermediate scales ( see sect .",
    "2.7 of romeo et al .",
    "this means that the gravitational coupling between the two components is negligible as @xmath46 and @xmath45 , and so is the right - hand side of eq .",
    "therefore the two branches of the dispersion relation behave asymptotically as @xmath79 and @xmath80 , i.e.  they converge to @xmath96 as @xmath46 and diverge positively as @xmath45 . since the potentially unstable branch @xmath78 lies below @xmath97 ( cf .",
    "property i ) and @xmath97 has a minimum for @xmath98 , @xmath78 must also have a global minimum below @xmath96 .",
    "thus the disc is stable  la toomre , like each component ( see left panel of fig .  2 ) .",
    "the response of hi is similar to the previous case , while @xmath6 behaves differently ( see sect .",
    "2.5 of romeo et al .",
    "the self - gravity term gets dominant for large @xmath21 and makes @xmath99 negative .",
    "so @xmath78 is also negative in this limit ( cf .",
    "property i ) . for small @xmath21",
    ", @xmath99 is positive since it is dominated by the pressure term ( @xmath100 ) and/or the rotation term ( @xmath101 ) . as neither @xmath102 nor @xmath103 is driven by self - gravity at large scales , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 4 ) is negligible as @xmath46 .",
    "so @xmath78 is positive in this limit , like @xmath103 and @xmath102 .",
    "the disc is then unstable at small scales and stable at large scales , like @xmath6 itself ( see right panel of fig .  2 ) .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath6 is intermediate between the previous two cases ( see sect .  2.3 of romeo et al .",
    "a similar flow of arguments shows that the disc is in a phase of transition between stability  la toomre and instability at small scales , like @xmath6 itself .",
    "the middle panel of fig .  2 illustrates the phase of small - scale instability , which occurs for @xmath104 ( see hoffmann 2010 for a detailed analysis ) .",
    "note how the two components contribute to the gravitational instability of the disc , and how their coupling widens the range of unstable scales .",
    "this case involves three components : hi , @xmath6 and stars . in nearby spiral galaxies , hi and @xmath6 have distinct domains : hi dominates the outer regions of the gas disc , while @xmath6 dominates the inner regions ( e.g. , leroy et al .",
    "we can then consider hi and @xmath6 separately .",
    "this makes sense here because we already know how the gravitational coupling between hi and @xmath6 modifies the main stability regimes of gas turbulence ( see sect .",
    "what we now want to understand is the role that stars play in this stability scenario .",
    "let us then distinguish two cases :    1 .",
    "_ stars plus @xmath6 .",
    "_ since the stellar component populates regime a ( like hi ) and @xmath6 populates regimes a ",
    "c , this case is qualitatively similar to the set of cases analysed in sect .",
    "so there are three stability regimes : stability  la toomre , instability at small scales , and a phase of stability transition .",
    "note that such a variety of regimes is driven by @xmath6 turbulence .",
    "the stellar component can only modify the shape of the dispersion relation ; it can not change the type of stability regime .",
    "note also that there is a mismatch between two important scales .",
    "one is the characteristic scale of stellar instabilities , @xmath105 , which is typically @xmath106 ( see , e.g. , binney & tremaine 2008 ) .",
    "the other is the largest scale at which @xmath6 turbulence has been observed , @xmath107 ( e.g. , bolatto et al .",
    "since @xmath108 is one order of magnitude larger than @xmath109 , the stellar component can not play a significant role in such stability regimes .",
    "therefore this is essentially a one - component case , driven and dominated by @xmath6 . in sect .  3",
    ", we will show that such stability regimes can indeed be frequent in nearby star - forming spirals .",
    "_ stars plus .",
    "_ as both components populate regime a , this is a case of stability  la toomre : @xmath78 has a global minimum , which determines whether the disc is stable for all wavenumbers or not ( cf .",
    "in contrast to case ( i ) , hi turbulence reaches scales as large as 110 kpc ( e.g. , kim et al .  2007 ; dutta 2011 ) .",
    "this makes it possible for the stellar component to ` interact ' with hi turbulence and contribute significantly to two - fluid instabilities , as in the classical case of stars plus non - turbulent gas .",
    "as discussed above , case ( ii ) represents the only stability regime in which stars play a non - negligible role .",
    "we then focus on this case , and analyse how gas turbulence affects the onset of gravitational instability in the disc , i.e.  the local stability threshold and the corresponding characteristic wavelength .",
    "the effect of disc thickness is well known in this context ( romeo 1992 , 1994 ; elmegreen 2011 ; romeo & wiegert 2011 ) .",
    "so we do not take that effect into account .",
    "as this is a toomre - like case , the local stability criterion can be expressed in the usual form @xmath17 , where @xmath110 is the effective @xmath18 parameter . in the classical case of stars plus non - turbulent gas , @xmath110 depends on three parameters : @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 . for analysing @xmath110 in detail ,",
    "it is useful to factor out the dependence on @xmath111 , @xmath114 , and study the stability threshold @xmath115 as a function of @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( romeo & wiegert 2011 ) . when gas turbulence is taken into account via eq .",
    "( 3 ) , @xmath115 depends on five parameters : @xmath118 @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the stellar toomre wavenumber .",
    "a general five - parameter study of @xmath115 is not more useful than a targeted few - parameter analysis .",
    "this is because @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath121 are tightly constrained by observations , and because their observed values fall within a single stability regime ( remember that this is a region of the parameter space where the disc has similar stability properties ) . for these reasons ,",
    "we analyse @xmath115 as a function of @xmath122 and @xmath123 , choosing observationally motivated values of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath121 : @xmath124 , which is the typical scaling of hi turbulence ( see sect .  1 ) , and @xmath125 , which are the median and @xmath126 scatter of @xmath121 in the outer discs of things spirals ( where hi dominates ; see sect .  3 ) .",
    "the range @xmath127 is also representative of clumpy galaxies at intermediate and high redshifts . and @xmath128 .",
    "the median properties of the discs are summarized in his table 1 ( see also his sect .",
    "3.2 ) . using those data , we find that the stellar toomre wavenumber is @xmath129 at @xmath130 and @xmath131 at @xmath128 .",
    "the spatial resolution is @xmath132 and @xmath133 in the two cases ( puech , private communication ) .",
    "this yields @xmath134 at @xmath130 and @xmath135 at @xmath128 .",
    "thus , even at intermediate and high redshifts , @xmath121 is remarkably close to unity and lies within the @xmath126 scatter computed from things . ]    , for discs of stars and turbulent hi vs.  the classical case of stars plus non - turbulent gas .",

    "3 shows a contour map of the stability threshold @xmath115 for classical and turbulent discs .",
    "consider the classical case first , and look at the contour levels @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "their slope changes abruptly across the line @xmath138 , showing that there are two distinct stability regimes .",
    "this fact has a simple explanation in terms of star - gas decoupling ( bertin & romeo 1988 ; romeo & wiegert 2011 ) . when @xmath139 and @xmath140 , @xmath78 has two minima : one at small @xmath21 , where the response of the stellar component peaks ; and the other at large @xmath21 , where gas dominates . for @xmath141 ,",
    "the gaseous minimum is deeper than the stellar one , and therefore it controls the onset of disc instability .",
    "vice versa , for @xmath142 , it is the stellar minimum that determines the stability threshold .",
    "the line @xmath138 separates gas- from star - dominated regimes even when @xmath143 , but the transition is smooth in this case since @xmath78 has a single minimum . in the turbulent case ,",
    "each contour level is on average shifted down .",
    "as @xmath115 increases in the same direction , this means that turbulence lowers the stability threshold , i.e.  it tends to stabilize the disc . in sect .  3",
    ", we will evaluate the statistical significance of this effect .",
    "the global minimum of @xmath78 provides another useful stability diagnostic : the least stable wavelength @xmath144 ( see jog 1996 for the classical case ) . when the disc is marginally stable , the value of @xmath145 is of particular interest .",
    "it is the wavelength at which instability first appears as @xmath111 drops below @xmath115 .",
    "this wavelength can be written as @xmath146 , where @xmath147 .",
    "the characteristic wavelength @xmath148 depends on the same parameters as @xmath115 .",
    "so we adopt the same approach as before , and analyse @xmath148 as a function of @xmath122 and @xmath123 for observationally motivated values of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath121 .    , for discs of stars and turbulent hi vs.  the classical case of stars plus non - turbulent gas .",

    "4 shows a contour map of the characteristic wavelength @xmath148 for classical and turbulent discs . in the classical case ,",
    "the contour levels @xmath149 and @xmath150 are truncated above @xmath138 .",
    "this tells us that such short characteristic wavelengths occur only when stars and gas are decoupled and gas dominates . in fact , star - dominated instabilities appear at longer wavelengths : @xmath151 ( bertin & romeo 1988 ) . note also that the contour @xmath152 is a separatrix .",
    "levels below 0.5 are on the left of this curve ( and connected to the transition line ) , while levels above 0.5 are on the right . in the turbulent case ,",
    "each contour level below 0.3 is on average shifted to the right , i.e.  in the direction of increasing @xmath148 .",
    "this means that turbulence shortens the characteristic wavelength when stars and gas are decoupled and gas dominates .",
    "an opposite , although weaker , effect is detectable for @xmath153 .",
    "other regimes are also affected , but in a more complex way .",
    "this is especially true for @xmath154 , since the separatrix of the parameter plane shifts to larger values .",

    "we now consider a sample of twelve nearby star - forming spirals from things : ngc 628 , 3198 , 3184 , 4736 , 3351 , 6946 , 3627 , 5194 , 3521 , 2841 , 5055 , and 7331 . for these galaxies , a detailed analysis by leroy et al .",

    "hi dominates the gas surface density in the outer disc , typically for @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is the optical radius ( leroy et al .",

    ", we analyse the case @xmath124 in detail , since it represents hi observations fairly well ( see sect .  1 ) .",
    "we have also studied the case @xmath168 , as representative of high - resolution simulations of supersonic turbulence ( see sect .  1 ) , but here we will only mention it when discussing the results of our stability analysis . hereafter",
    "we will refer to the model described above as _",
    "model 1_.          in sect .",
    "2.4 , we have seen that there is a region in the parameter plane where @xmath169 has two minima .",
    "this is the two - phase region introduced by bertin & romeo ( 1988 ) and further investigated by romeo & wiegert ( 2011 ) .",
    "5 shows the two - phase region for classical and turbulent discs . within this region ,",
    "stars and gas are dynamically decoupled and the disc is susceptible to instabilities at two different wavelengths , where the responses of the two components peak . in the stellar phase the disc is more susceptible to long - wavelength instabilities , whereas in the gaseous phase it is dominated by short - wavelength instabilities . along the transition line between the phases , neither component dominates and instabilities occur both at short and at long wavelengths . outside the two - phase region ,",
    "the two components are strongly coupled and instabilities occur at intermediate wavelengths .",
    "we populate the parameter plane with measurements taken from the sample of spiral galaxies , and colour - code them by radius .",
    "we draw the turbulent two - phase region corresponding to the median and @xmath126 scatter of @xmath170 for @xmath171 .",
    "note the following points :    1 .",
    "the two - phase region of a classical disc is symmetric about @xmath172 .",
    "this symmetry is broken for a turbulent disc because gas ( dominant for @xmath173 ) follows turbulent scaling , but stars ( dominant for @xmath174 ) do not .",
    "2 .   the turbulent two - phase region is larger than the classical one .",
    "this follows from the fact that turbulence pushes the minima of @xmath169 further apart , and the maximum between them further up , so as to favour star - gas decoupling .",
    "the transition line appears unaffected by the scatter of @xmath170 .",
    "this is because the shape of the two - phase region depends on @xmath116 and @xmath175 , and @xmath175 is not affected by turbulence ( @xmath176 ) if @xmath42 .",
    "4 .   turbulence increases the size of the stellar phase more than that of the gaseous phase .",
    "recall that the boundary of the two - phase region is marked by the disappearance of the non - dominant peak , i.e. the gas peak in the stellar phase and vice versa .",
    "since turbulence affects the gaseous peak more than the stellar peak , the size of the stellar phase is affected more than that of the gaseous phase .",
    "for @xmath171 , this causes a significant number of measurements to populate the stellar phase .",
    "5 .   for @xmath177 , we find that @xmath178 of all points populate the two - phase region , two - thirds of them in the gaseous phase . in such cases ,",
    "the onset of gravitational instability is controlled by h@xmath179 .",
    "turbulence is expected to play an important role in this process at scales smaller than about @xmath180 ( see sect .",

    "we neglect gas turbulence . on the right , we consider turbulent hi ( @xmath124 ) for @xmath171 .",
    "values of @xmath110 smaller than unity mean gravitational instability .",
    "we indicate the median and @xmath126 scatter of @xmath110 for radii smaller and larger than @xmath186 .",
    "we also colour - code the component that contributes more to disc instability according to the classical condition : gas for @xmath187 , and stars for @xmath188 ( romeo & wiegert 2011 ) .    for @xmath177",
    ", @xmath110 spans a wide range of values , with @xmath189 of points in the unstable regime . here",
    "@xmath190 of points are gas - dominated and tend to be less stable than the star - dominated points ( the median value of @xmath191 is @xmath192 and @xmath193 in the two cases ) .",
    "for @xmath171 , the range spanned by @xmath110 is tighter and only @xmath181 of measurements are in the unstable regime . here",
    "the majority ( @xmath194 ) of points are star - dominated , and there is no clear difference in @xmath110 between star- and gas - dominated points ( @xmath192 and @xmath195 ) .    introducing turbulent scaling for @xmath171 only has a small effect on the measurements .",
    "for @xmath183 , the median of @xmath110 increases by @xmath196 and the @xmath126 scatter by @xmath197 . for @xmath198 , the median increases by @xmath199 and the @xmath126 scatter by @xmath200 .",
    "this suggests that turbulence tends to stabilize the disc ( the median increases ) , although the magnitude of this effect is small and depends on the non - turbulent value of @xmath110 ( the scatter increases ) .",
    "the stabilizing effect of turbulence seems at odds with results from romeo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , who found that the stability of gaseous discs is unaffected by turbulence if @xmath201 . the difference lies , of course , in the gravitational coupling of stars and gas .",
    "consider the approximation for the effective @xmath18 parameter introduced by romeo & wiegert ( 2011 ) :    @xmath202    @xmath203    we see that , even if @xmath204 , the scaling @xmath205 affects the weight factor @xmath206 .",
    "the strength of this effect is determined by the power - law slope @xmath5 .",
    "therefore the effective @xmath18 parameter of turbulent discs always differs from the classical case .",
    "shows radial profiles of the least stable wavelength , @xmath207 , for our sample . on the left",
    "we neglect gas turbulence , whereas on the right we consider turbulent hi for @xmath171 .",
    "colour - coding indicates the component that dominates gravitational instability . as before ,",
    "the median and @xmath126 scatter are indicated separately for small and large radii .    for @xmath177",
    ", there is a clear gap between gas- and star - dominated points ( the median value of @xmath208 is @xmath209 and @xmath210 in the two cases ) .",
    "so the gas - dominated points are characterized by much smaller values of @xmath145 .",
    "the discrepancy is less significant for @xmath171 , apart from a few measurements close to @xmath186 ( @xmath211 and @xmath212 ) .    introducing a turbulent gas component for @xmath171 causes a significant increase in @xmath145 . for @xmath183 , the median of @xmath145 increases by @xmath213 and the @xmath126 scatter by @xmath214 . for @xmath198 , the median increases by @xmath215 and",
    "the increase in @xmath126 scatter is again @xmath214 .",
    "this suggests a tendency of turbulence to boost the least stable wavelength . as for @xmath110 ,",
    "the magnitude of this effect depends on the non - turbulent value of @xmath145 .",
    "there is a small number of gas - dominated measurements for which the least stable wavelength decreases , but these have large uncertainties .",
    "why does turbulence affect @xmath216 more than @xmath110 ?",
    "the answer is twofold .",
    "first , for a purely gaseous disc @xmath145 increases markedly with @xmath110 ( romeo et al .",
    "2010 ) , so that any change in @xmath110 will be amplified in @xmath145 .",
    "second , as stars are taken into account , gas - dominated points can enter the star - dominated regime , where @xmath145 is much larger ( see sect .",
    "both effects depend on the power - law slopes @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "they sum up and drive @xmath145 to significantly larger values .",
    "modelling the gas disc as a single component with an intermediate value of @xmath157 is not the best that can be done . here",
    "we will no longer follow this traditional approach .",
    "we will model the gas disc as made of two components , each with the more representative value of @xmath157 .",
    "a simple way to do it is to treat the inner part of the disc as @xmath6 dominated and the outer part as hi dominated .",
    "we then set @xmath217 for @xmath218 and @xmath156 for @xmath163 ( cf .",
    "introductory part of sect .",
    "besides @xmath157 , there is another quantity that deserves particular attention : the stellar radial velocity dispersion , which we now denote with @xmath219 .",
    "leroy et al .  ( 2008 ) inferred @xmath219 from the vertical velocity dispersion , @xmath220 , assuming that @xmath221 .",
    "in turn , @xmath220 was inferred from the stellar exponential scale height , @xmath222 , using the relation @xmath223 .",
    "gerssen & shapiro griffin ( 2012 ) showed that @xmath224 decreases markedly from early- to late - type spirals .",
    "the average hubble stage of things spirals is @xmath225 , which corresponds to galaxy type sbc ( the mean and the median of @xmath226 are equal ) .",
    "the best - fitting model of gerssen & shapiro griffin ( 2012 ) then yields @xmath227 ( see their fig .",
    "4 ) . concerning @xmath222 , the relation used by leroy et al .",
    "( 2008 ) is not correct .",
    "it is the total surface density in the disc that determines the stellar exponential scale height : @xmath228 , where @xmath229 ( bahcall & casertano 1984 ; romeo 1992 ) . in view of these facts , we set @xmath227 and use the correct relation for @xmath222 .",
    "finally , we implement gas turbulence as in model 1 , i.e.  only for @xmath163 , where the disc is hi dominated .",
    "this is simply because the constant spatial resolution of 800 pc used by leroy et al .",
    "( 2008 ) is too coarse to probe the range of scales affected by @xmath6 turbulence [ see sect .  2.4 , case ( i ) ] .",

    "@xmath191 is more robust , with a difference well below a factor of 2 . in model 2 , both @xmath208 and @xmath191 are smaller for @xmath177 and larger for @xmath171 .    despite these differences ,",
    "the effect of turbulence is comparable in the two models . for @xmath177 , @xmath231 and @xmath232",

    "so h@xmath179 is more decoupled from stars and slightly more dominant . for @xmath171",
    ", @xmath231 is almost identical in the two models , irrespective of the value of @xmath42 .",
    "turbulence increases the median value of @xmath191 by less than 10% in both models .",
    "in contrast , the median value of @xmath208 increases by 2030% in model 2 , i.e. less than in model 1 . summarizing ,",
    "the effect of hi turbulence in model 2 is only slightly weaker than in model 1 .",
    "this points to the robustness of our results .",
    "our results can not be directly compared with those of shadmehri & khajenabi ( 2012 ) , hereafter sk12 .",
    "this is partly because of the wider scope of our paper , which embraces a brand - new application to things spirals , and because most of the analysis carried out by sk12 can not be easily interpreted .",
    "sk12 analysed five stability regimes of gas turbulence : @xmath233 and @xmath36 ; @xmath234 and @xmath235 ; and regimes a ",
    "the first regime corresponds to a fractal dimension @xmath236 higher than 3 , and is therefore beyond the natural range of @xmath4 ( see fig .  1 and sect .  3 of romeo et al .",
    "2010 ) . in the second regime ,",
    "the volume density is scale - independent ( @xmath237 ) , so the medium is incompressible and hence subsonic .",
    "cold interstellar gas is instead dominated by compressible structures and supersonic motions .",
    "therefore even this regime is of marginal interest ( see again fig .  1 and sect .  3 of romeo et al .",
    "regimes b and c are populated by @xmath6 turbulence , which manifests itself at scales less than @xmath107 . in turn , @xmath109 is one order of magnitude smaller than the characteristic scale of stellar instabilities",
    ". therefore stars play a negligible role in these stability regimes [ see sect .  2.4 , case ( i ) ] .",
    "sk12 reached the opposite conclusion .",
    "but this is because they assumed larson - type scaling relations even at kpc scales , disregarding the type of turbulence associated with such regimes .",
    "regime a is populated by both @xmath6 and hi turbulence .",
    "while the @xmath6 case raises the same issue as regimes b and c , the hi case is conceptually simpler .",
    "hi turbulence manifests itself at all scales of galactic interest , so stars can play a significant role in this stability regime [ see sect .  2.4 , case ( ii ) ] .",
    "sk12 reached a similar conclusion .",
    "however , even in this case , their approach is different from ours .",
    "they chose @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath121 so as to sample regime a , and studied the dispersion relation numerically .",
    "we have instead examined the whole regime analytically ( see sect .",
    "we have then chosen observationally motivated values of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath121 , and analysed the onset of gravitational instability in the disc ( see in particular sects 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 ) .    in conclusion",
    ", there is a fundamental difference between our analysis and that of sk12 .",
    "our analysis takes into account the astrophysical relevance of the various stability regimes , as well as the tight constraints imposed by observations of ism turbulence in the milky way and nearby galaxies .",
    "these are important aspects of the problem , which are missing from their analysis .",
    "our analysis of things spirals shows that hi turbulence has a triple effect on the outer regions of galactic discs : ( i ) it weakens the coupling between gas and stars in the development of disc instabilities , ( ii ) it makes the disc more prone to star - dominated than gas - dominated instabilities , and ( iii ) it typically increases the least stable wavelength by 2040% ( the steeper the hi scaling relations , the larger the effect ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the typical 38% increase predicted for the effective @xmath18 parameter .",
    "the effect of hi turbulence is in a sense complementary to the effect of disc thickness .",
    "in fact , disc thickness increases the effective @xmath18 parameter by 2050% ( romeo & wiegert 2011 ) but hardly changes the least stable wavelength ( romeo 1992 , 1994 ) or the condition for star - gas decoupling ( romeo & wiegert 2011 ) .",
    "our analysis of things spirals also suggests that @xmath6 turbulence has a significant effect on the inner regions of galactic discs . for @xmath238 ,",
    "i.e.  where @xmath6 dominates over hi , 6070% of the data fulfil the condition for star - gas decoupling and 7080% of these points represent gas - dominated stability regimes . in such cases ,",
    "the onset of gravitational instability is controlled by @xmath6 .",
    "turbulence is expected to play an important role in this process at scales smaller than about 100 pc ( see sect .",
    "if @xmath239 and @xmath16 , then @xmath6 turbulence drives the disc to a regime of transition between instability at small scales and stability  la toomre , as was first pointed out by romeo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) in the case of one - component turbulent discs .",
    "since this is a regime of transition , even small deviations from the standard @xmath6 scaling laws ( @xmath239 and @xmath16 ) can have a strong impact on the gravitational instability of the disc .",
    "this is true even when the mass densities of hi and @xmath6 are comparable , since small - scale instabilities are more actively controlled by @xmath6 ( see sect .",

    "<S> we investigate the gravitational instability of galactic discs , treating stars and cold interstellar gas as two distinct components , and taking into account the phenomenology of turbulence in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , i.e.  the larson - type scaling relations observed in the molecular and atomic gas . </S>",
    "<S> besides deriving general properties of such systems , we analyse a large sample of galaxies from the hi nearby galaxy survey ( things ) , and show in detail how interstellar turbulence affects disc instability in star - forming spirals . </S>",
    "<S> we find that turbulence has a significant effect on both the inner and the outer regions of the disc . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it drives the inner gas disc to a regime of transition between two instability phases and makes the outer disc more prone to star - dominated instabilities .    </S>",
