    "the delta ( @xmath3 ) plays a very important role in low - energy pion - nucleon ( @xmath4 ) scattering and correlated processes , such as the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "its contribution as an intermediate state , in many instances , supersedes that of the the nucleon .",
    "this happens for two main reasons .",
    "the first one is that the @xmath5 coupling constant is rather large , whereas the other is related to chiral symmetry .    at low energies ,",
    "pion - hadron interactions are well described by effective theories , in which an approximate @xmath6 symmetry , broken by the pion mass @xmath7 , accounts for the smallness of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 quark masses . in this framework ,",
    "elastic pion - baryon scattering is dominated by diagrams involving both contact terms and propagating states . in order to comply with threshold chiral theorems , the latter",
    "are typically given by polynomials in small quantities , such as the pion mass or three - momenta , divided by energy denominators .",
    "when the delta is present , the scale of some denominators is given by the quantity @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are respectively the delta and nucleon masses .",
    "as the difference @xmath13 is small , one has @xmath14 .",
    "delta contributions are given by ratios of small quantities and may turn out to be large . in such cases , numerical values adopted for @xmath3 do influence predictions produced by effective theories , especially those that rely on the small scale expansion@xcite or the heavy baryon approximation@xcite .",
    "in chiral perturbation theory , there is a clear conceptual distinction between the bare baryon masses , present in the lagrangian , and their observed values , which include loop corrections .",
    "the former should , in principle , be preferred as inputs in the evaluation of theoretical amplitudes .",
    "nevertheless , as there is little knowledge available concerning the bare delta mass , one tends to use physical values in calculations . in most cases ,",
    "it is reasonable to expect that this would have little numerical importance . on the other hand ,",
    "in the case of the parameter @xmath3 , which is a small quantity , the influence of loops may become relatively large .",
    "recently bernard , hemmert and meissner@xcite , have stressed that the value of @xmath15 , the delta - nucleon mass splitting in the chiral limit , is an important constraint to lattice data extrapolation .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to estimate the delta @xmath16-term , which controls the change induced in @xmath3 when one goes from bare to physical masses .",
    "this @xmath16-term was studied in the framework of a quark model by lyubovitskij , gutsche , faessler and drukarev@xcite and the reader is referred to their paper for a clear formulation of the problem and earlier works .    according to the feynman - hellmann theorem@xcite the mass @xmath17 of a baryon @xmath18 is related to its sigma - term @xmath19 by @xmath20 .",
    "therefore the sigma - term provides a measure of the shift in the baryon mass due to chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "whenever it is possible to evaluate @xmath19 as a function of @xmath21 , the bare mass @xmath22 can be extracted from the relation m_b = m_b_0 + _ 0^^2 d _",
    "b( ) /  . [ 1.1 ]    as the leading term in @xmath19 is proportional to @xmath23 , it enters directly the mass shift and the difference @xmath24 already provides a crude estimate for the bare value . in the case of the nucleon , one has @xmath25=45 mev@xcite , which amounts to 5% of its physical mass . in chiral perturbation theory , the leading contribution to @xmath25 can not be predicted theoretically .",
    "formally , it is associated with the constant @xmath26 of the second order lagrangian@xcite , which can be extracted from empirical subthreshold information .",
    "the situation of the delta is much worse , for @xmath27 scattering data are not available .",
    "one is then forced to resort to models in order to calculate the delta @xmath16-term , which is associated with the parameter @xmath28 defined in ref.@xcite .    in this work",
    "we estimate @xmath29 using a model which proved to be successful in the case of the nucleon .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ 2 ] we review our calculational procedure in the case of the nucleon and present results for the delta in section [ 3 ] , leaving technical details to the appendices .",
    "the main expressions for both the nucleon and delta @xmath16-terms in configuration space are given in appendix [ b ] , written in terms of the loop integrals defined in appendix [ a ] .",
    "the consistency of our results with standard chiral counting rules is discussed in appendix [ c ] whereas their behaviour in the chiral limit is given in appendix [ d ] .",
    "a summary is provided in section [ 4 ] .",
    "in order to evaluate @xmath29 , we follow a procedure used previously in the study of @xmath30 , the nucleon scalar form factor@xcite , which is briefly reviewed here .",
    "the leading contributions to this function is @xmath31 whereas the triangle diagram , involving only known masses and coupling constants , gives rise to corrections which begin at @xmath32 and are completely determined . at @xmath33 ,",
    "on the other hand , interactions incorporate the low energy constants @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "data on @xmath4 subthreshold coefficients indicate that @xmath36 and @xmath35 are larger than @xmath26 and that their values are approximately saturated by @xmath3 intermendiate states@xcite .",
    "thus , up to @xmath33 , the function @xmath30 can be well represented by the leading tree contribution associated with @xmath26 , supplemented by the two triangle diagrams shown in fig.[fig : diagram ] , involving @xmath37 and @xmath3 intermediate states . in the sequence",
    "we will make use of the fact that , in configuration space , contact and loop contributions split apart , since the fourier transform acts as a filter@xcite . as a result ,",

    ", this regularization procedure amounts to adding @xmath38-functions and their derivatives to @xmath51 .",
    "this gives rise to a regularized form factor which is very large both at @xmath52 and in a sizeable vicinity of that point .",
    "we argue , in the sequence , that this picture is not consistent with the definition of the form factor given by eq.([2.1 ] ) .",
    "pions are goldstone bosons , collective states derived from the @xmath53 condensate .",
    "the corresponding degrees of freedom are appropriately accomodated into non - linear lagrangians and described by the field @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the isospin direction and @xmath56 is the chiral angle .",

    "strong_. it is worth noting that the words _ weak _ and _ strong _ , as used here , are akin to the notion of weak and strong electromagnetic fields developed by schwinger , and * not * at all related to the nature of the fundamental interactions . in the former case , changes in the @xmath53 condensate are small , one relies on the approximation @xmath58 and can employ perturbative techniques , as in chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) . in the latter , disturbances of the qcd vacuum become important and the non - linear nature of pionic interactions manifests itself through the condition @xmath59 . the physical picture behind eq.([2.5 ] ) is that pions , as goldstone bosons , destroy the @xmath53 condensate in order to exist .    when strong fields are present , constraints also apply to the scalar form factor .",

    "[ 2.6 ]    this structure shows that @xmath39 is a bound function and definition ( [ 2.1 ] ) means that the same necessarily happens with the scalar form factor .",
    "the function @xmath60 corresponds to a mass density induced in the vacuum by the presence of the nucleon , which manifests itself in the form of a pion cloud .",
    "far away from the nucleon , eq.([2.6 ] ) yields the density of the condensate , which is negative and equal to @xmath61 . in the description of a nucleon , it is convenient to use a convention for the energy in which the density tends to zero at long distances and @xmath39 is rewritten as _",

    "[ 2.7 ]    in this new convention , the density vanishes when @xmath62 and increases monotonically as one approaches the center of the nucleon as in fig.[fig : snucleon ] . at a critical radius @xmath63",
    "one has @xmath64 , the density becomes that of empty space and the condition _",
    "n(r ) = f_^2 ^ 2 [ 2.8 ]    holds . beyond this point , a further increase in @xmath43 would correspond to @xmath65 . in order to prevent this behaviour",
    ", we assume that the condensate no longer exists in the region @xmath66 , and that the energy density saturates at @xmath67 .",

    "n = r^3 f_^2 ^2 + 4_r^drr^2_n(r ) [ 2.9 ]    instead of eq.([2.3 ] ) .",
    "this procedure is the basis of our model .    in the numerical determination of @xmath25",
    ", we use the results of appendix [ b ] and consider two possibilities for the @xmath68 coupling constant in the lagrangian ( [ b.2 ] ) , corresponding to either the @xmath69 prediction @xmath70 or @xmath71 , which yields @xmath72=120mev for the @xmath3 decay width .",

    "therefore , we note that , although the chiral powers of the pion mass expected from triangle diagrams are not explicit in the expressions of appendix [ b ] , the use of covariant relations among integrals@xcite allows results for partial contributions to the @xmath16-term to be recast in such a way that these powers become apparent , as shown in appendix [ c ] . in appendix [ d ] we show that the formal chiral expansion of eq.([2.9 ] ) gives rise to the expected non - analytic terms ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) and agrees fully with that produced by standard chiral perturbation theory@xcite , provided the renormalization scale is identified with @xmath76 .",
