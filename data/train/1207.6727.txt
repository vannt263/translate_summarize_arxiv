    "the  oscillations are explained in terms of second - order weak processes involving the the ckm matrix element @xmath1 : a broad class of generic extensions of the sm is expected to affect the mixing amplitude , modifying the mixing `` intensity''that is the oscillation frequency  and the phase , .",
    "a non - sm enhancement of   would also decrease the size of the decay - width difference between the light and heavy mass eigenstates of the  meson ,  @xcite . while the oscillation intensity has been measured precisely  @xcite , only loose constraints on the phase were available until recently .",
    "the most effective determination of  and  is achieved through the analysis of the time evolution of flavor  tagged  decays .",
    "the first such analysis was performed by the cdf experiment in 2008  @xcite . immediately after d0 joined . in 2010 the combination of cdf and",

    "the decays , collected by a low  momentum dimuon trigger , are fully reconstructed using four tracks originating from a common displaced vertex , two matched to muon pairs consistent with a  decay ( @xmath3 @xmath4 ) , and two consistent with a @xmath5 decay ( @xmath6 @xmath4 ) . the dimuon mass constraint to the known  mass combined with",
