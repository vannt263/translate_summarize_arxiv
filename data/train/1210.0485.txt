    "the coronal heating @xcite mechanism is one of the major unsolved problems in solar physics .",
    "since the energy flux carried by acoustic waves is too small , the possibility of heating by mhd waves has been investigated intensively as the magnetic structure of the solar corona can play an important role here @xcite .",
    "the propagation of alfvn waves is one of the candidate mechanisms that can carry energy to large distances from the surface , and heat the solar corona .",
    "however , a heating theory based on the alfvn waves faces a couple of difficulties : firstly , the waves have to transport enough energy flux , and secondly , they have to dissipate efficiently in order to deposit the right amount of energy at the right place @xcite",
    ". the alfvn waves may reach the corona even in the absence of highly stratified atmosphere but with lesser propagation speed .",
    "the damping length of alfvn modes is defined by various dissipative processes such as phase mixing @xcite , resonance absorption @xcite , and nonlinear mode conversion @xcite .",
    "phase mixing is a mechanism for dissipating alfvn waves , which was first proposed by @xcite .",
    "when alfvn waves propagating in an inhomogeneous medium , on each magnetic field line , a wave propagates with its own local alfvn speed . after a certain distance or after enough time , these neighboring perturbations will be out of phase .",
    "this ultimately results in a strong enhancement of the dissipation of alfvn waves energy via both viscosity and resistivity . @xcite and @xcite analytically showed that in both the strong phase mixing limit and the weak damping approximation , the amplitude of alfvn waves decays with time as  exp(-t@xmath0 ) .",
    "@xcite calculated numerically the damping times of oscillations in the presence of viscosity and resistivity in coronal loops .",
    "they concluded that the above exponential damping law in time is valid for the lundquist numbers higher than  @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite studied the effect of stratification due to gravity on phase mixing , and found that the wavelengths lengthen when alfvn waves propagate through a stratified plasma .",
    "they concluded that a vertical stratification of density makes phase mixing by ohmic heating less important in coronal heating problem .",
    "they also found that in a stratified atmosphere , the heat will be deposited higher up than in an unstratified atmosphere , and that the viscous heating will be the dominant component in the heating processes at lower heights .",
    "however , in coronal conditions the effect of stratification on efficiency of phase mixing would still be large as the height at which most heat would be deposited through ohmic dissipation is increased considerably by stratification .",
    "moreover , depending on the value of pressure scale height , phase mixing can either be more or less efficient than in the uniform case .",
    "spicules have long been investigated as a coronal heating agent @xcite .",
    "they are grass - like spiky features seen in chromospheric spectral lines at the solar limb @xcite .",
    "these spiky dynamic jets are propelled upwards at speeds of about @xmath2  km  s@xmath3 from photosphere into the magnetized low atmosphere of the sun .",
    "their diameter varies from spicule to spicule having the values from @xmath4  km to @xmath5  km .",
    "the mean length of classical spicules varies from @xmath6  km to @xmath7  km , and the typical life time of them is @xmath8 min . the typical electron density at heights where the spicules are observed is @xmath9 @xmath10 , and their temperatures are estimated @xmath11 k @xcite . @xcite by analyzing the height series of @xmath12 spectra in solar limb spicules observed their transverse oscillations .",
    "the period of them estimated @xmath13 and @xmath14 s. they concluded that these oscillations can be caused by propagating kink waves in spicules .",
    "@xcite based on _ hinode _ observations concluded that the most expected periods of transverse oscillations lay between @xmath15 s , which interpreted as signatures of alfvn waves .",
    "@xcite used _",
    "hinode_/sot observations of spicules , and concluded that upward propagating , downward propagating and standing waves occurred at the rates of about @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , they found that upward propagating waves dominate at lower latitudes , and the medians of amplitude , period , and velocity amplitude are @xmath18 km , @xmath19 s , and @xmath20 km s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "more recently @xcite made time - slice images of spicules , which were observed by _",
    "they concluded that the energy flux stored in spicule axis oscillations is of the order of coronal energy loss in quiet sun .",
    "these results motivated us to study the phase mixing of upward propagating alfvn waves in a stratified atmosphere . to do so",
    ", the section @xmath21 gives the basic equations and the theoretical model . in section @xmath22 the numerical results are presented and discussed , and a brief summary is followed in section @xmath23 .",
    "in the present work we keep the effects of stratification due to gravity in @xmath21d x - z plane .",
    "the phase mixing and dissipation of propagating alfvn waves in a region with non - uniform alfvn velocity is studied .",
    "mhd equations governing the plasma dynamics are as follows : @xmath24 @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are constant viscosity and resistivity coefficients , and other quantities have the usual meaning . in particular , typical values for @xmath30 in the solar chromosphere and corona are @xmath31 and @xmath32 m@xmath33s@xmath3 , respectively . the value of @xmath34 for a fully ionized h plasma is @xmath35 kg m@xmath3 s@xmath3 @xcite .",

    "we presented the perturbed magnetic field variations obtained from our numerical analysis in figure  [ fig3 ] for @xmath82 km , @xmath83 km ; @xmath82 km , @xmath84 km ; and @xmath82 km , @xmath85 km respectively . in these plots",
    "the perturbed velocity and magnetic field is normalized to @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively . in each set of plots",
    "it is appeared that both the perturbed velocity and magnetic field are damped in the developed stage of phase mixing .",
    "but for the perturbed magnetic field.[fig3],title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   but for the perturbed magnetic field.[fig3],title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   but for the perturbed magnetic field.[fig3],title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    further , at the first height ( 1000 km ) , total amplitude of both velocity and magnetic field oscillations have values near to the initial ones . as height increases ,",
    "the perturbed velocity amplitude does increase in contrast to the behavior of perturbed magnetic field .",
    "nonetheless , exponentially damping behavior is obvious in both cases .",
    "this means that with an increase in height , amplitude of velocity oscillations is expanded due to significant decrease in density , which acts as inertia against oscillations .",
    "similar results are observed by time - distance analysis of solar spicule oscillations @xcite .",
    "it is worth to note that the density stratification influence on the magnetic field is negligible , which is in agreement with solar optical telescope observations of solar spicules @xcite .",
    "figures  [ fig4 ] ,  [ fig5 ] show the @xmath88 plots of the perturbed velocity and magnetic field with respect to @xmath63 , @xmath64 for @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 .",
    "they show that in the presence of stratification due to gravity , the damping takes place in space than in time as an important point of these graphs .",
    "it should be emphasized that the damping time scale of the velocity field pattern is longer than the corresponding magnetic field pattern due to the initial conditions .",
    "in other words , in spite of standing waves , propagating waves are stable and dissipate after some periods due to phase mixing @xcite .    for calculating the damping time it is suitable to calculate the total energy ( kinetic energy plus magnetic energy ) per unit of length in @xmath92 direction as :    @xmath93.\\ ] ]    in figure  [ fig6 ] we plot the normalized total energy for three initial wave packet widths , i.e. @xmath94 , @xmath57 , and @xmath95 .",
    "since the treatments of different profiles of total energy are similar and the damping times are very close to each other , hence , we continue our calculations with @xmath57 , which is more logical compared with tube radius . in figure  [ fig7 ] the kinetic energy , magnetic energy , and total energy normalized to the initial total energy are presented respectively from top to bottom .",
    "the damping time calculated from total energy profile is @xmath96 s. actually , spicules have short lifetimes , and are transient phenomena .",
    "we claim that in such circumstances , phase mixing can occur in space rather than in time .",
    "this is in agreement with previous works @xcite",
    ". we can definitely consider it as an uncertain rule of thumb .",
    "are presented from top to bottom respectively.[fig7],title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   are presented from top to bottom respectively.[fig7],title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   are presented from top to bottom respectively.[fig7],title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    the total energy profile is best fitted to the exponential damping function in time ,  exp(-at@xmath97 ) , with @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "since the spicules are structures with low resistivity and viscosity coefficients , so this is in agreement with @xcite work .",
    "so far the presented results in this paper are taken with considering a steady flow ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "actually , it is of interest to investigate the differences in our numerical analysis outputs if the flow effect is omitted . to do that , we repeated the numerical analysis with zero - steady flow .",
    "interestingly , the relevant results did not show significant difference in respect to the case of non - zero steady flow .",
    "a short theoretical scaling may help to clarify this result ; comparing two dimensionless terms in eq .",
    "[ eq : velo ] : the convective term , which is associated with the steady flow , @xmath100 , and the lorentz term , @xmath101 , yields :    @xmath102    here @xmath103 , @xmath104 are the average values of @xmath105 , @xmath106 normalized to @xmath87 and @xmath86 .",
    "also , @xmath107 is normalized to @xmath86 assuming that both have the same order of magnitudes .",
    "moreover , @xmath108 has been taken into account . now with the large values of @xmath64 , and assuming that @xmath103 and @xmath104 have a same order of magnitudes , then @xmath109 .",
    "meaning that the effect of the lorentz term which is associated with the stratification effect is more important than the dominated convective term bringing into account the steady flow effects .",
    "thus as long as @xmath110 , one might ignore the steady flow effects here .",
    "similar scaling can be done in eq .",
    "[ eq : mag ] to show that in the presence of stratification the steady flow effects are ignorable .",
    "in our simple model , we assume that spicules are small scale structures ( relative to coronal loops and other mega structures ) with a uniform magnetic field , and a uniform temperature in all heights , and the transition region between chromosphere and corona has been neglected .",
    "density change along spicule axis is considerable , and stratification due to gravity is significant . as a result ,",
    "the medium is dense in its lower heights , but it becomes rare and rare as height increases .",
    "also , spicules have short lifetimes , and are transient phenomena .",
    "we claim that in such circumstances , phase mixing can occur in space rather than in time .",
    "this is in agreement with previous studies . in ordinary heights of a spicule ,",
    "there is enough space to amplitude of a wave to damp , and to transfer its energy to the medium .",
    "furthermore , we observed that the amplitude of perturbed velocity field , magnetic field and total energy decreases with height exponentially .",
    "our numerical analysis show that the main phase of evolution dynamics occurs only in the first one third of the spicule height .",
