    "quasi-1d bose gases have been realized in highly - elongated traps by tightly confining the transverse motion of the atoms to their zero point oscillations @xcite .",
    "as compared to the 3d case , the role of quantum fluctuations is enhanced in 1d and these systems are predicted to exhibit peculiar properties , which can not be described using traditional mean - field theories , but require more advanced many - body approaches .",
    "particularly intriguing is the strong coupling regime , where , due to repulsion between particles , the quasi-1d bose gas behaves as if it consisted of fictitious spinless fermions .",
    "this regime , the so called tonks - girardeau ( tg ) gas @xcite , has not been achieved yet , but is one of the main focus areas of present experimental investigations in this field @xcite . an interesting possibility to approach the strongly correlated tg regime",

    "degenerate quantum gases near a feshbach resonance have recently received a great deal of interest both experimentally and theoretically . at resonance ( @xmath4 ) the 3d scattering cross - section @xmath5 is fixed by the unitary condition , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the relative wave vector of the two atoms . in this regime",
    "it is predicted that , if the range @xmath8 of the atom - atom interaction potential is much smaller than the average interparticle distance , the behavior of the gas is universal , i.e. , independent of the details of the interatomic potential and independent of the actual value of @xmath0 @xcite .",

    ", the gas is expected to exhibit a universal behavior if the range @xmath8 of the atom - atom interaction potential is much smaller than @xmath14 and the mean interparticle distance is much larger than @xmath14 .",
    "it has been predicted that three - body recombination processes are suppressed for strongly interacting 1d bose gases @xcite .",
    "these studies raise the question whether the unitary regime can be reached in bose gases confined in highly - elongated traps , that is , whether the quasi-1d bosonic gas - like state is stable against cluster formation as @xmath15 .",
    "this paper , which is an extension of an earlier study @xcite , investigates the properties of a quasi-1d bose gas at zero temperature over a wide range of values of the 3d scattering length @xmath0 using quantum monte carlo ( mc ) techniques .",

    "we find , utilizing a variational 1d many - body framework , that the lowest - lying gas - like state is stable for negative coupling constants , up to a minimum critical value of @xmath127 .",
