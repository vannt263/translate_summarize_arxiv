    "this corresponds to a supergiant if the primary brightness ratio @xmath27 , to a giant if @xmath28 and to a main sequence star otherwise . for the secondary",
    ", we get @xmath29 .",
    "the respective critical values for @xmath30 are this time 0.12 and 0.07 .",
    "such a low contribution of the secondary to the total flux is improbable .",
    "@xcite criterion thus indicates a supergiant secondary , which is clearly at odds with the result of the @xcite criterion .",
    "however , the @xcite criterion can be biased if the 4686 line is partly filled by emission produced e.g.  in a wind interaction region , which is possibly the case in hd  152218 ( see sect .  [",
    "sect : xmm ] ) the comparison of our spectra with the atlas of standards @xcite seems to favor a giant class for the primary star , but it is very difficult to reject the main sequence option .",

    "we roughly estimated the optical brightness ratio based on the dilution of the primary and secondary lines in the spectrum of .",
    "for this purpose , we compared the mean ews of the primary and secondary lines with typical ( averaged ) ews of respectively o9 @xcite and o9.7 stars @xcite .",
    "we first compared the primary line strength with typical o9iii ews . based on the 4026 , 4144 , 4388 , 4471 , 4542 , 4686 and 4088 lines",
    ", we obtained an averaged brightness ratio of @xmath33 . using typical o9v ews yields a lower value @xmath34 .",
    "we however note that the 4088 line is particularly strong in the primary spectrum and is the main cause for the large scatter obtained . rejecting the 4088 line from the comparison with o9v typical ews",
    ", we obtained @xmath35 .        turning to the secondary component",
    ", we also compared the secondary line strengths to the typical ews reported by @xcite , who only considered the 4388 , 4471 and 4542 , 4686 lines .",
    "we note that the 4686 line provides results that clearly differ from the three other lines , but this is not surprising since the 4686 line is particularly faint in the secondary spectrum .",
    "mean values for the three other lines indicate @xmath36 and @xmath37 for dwarf and giant star respectively .",
    "the obtained values for the primary and secondary contribution to the observed fluxes are thus in acceptable agreement with each other .",
    "they also agree with the results of @xcite who quoted a primary to secondary uv flux ratio of 2.0 . in the following ,",
    "we will adopt a primary to secondary brightness ratio corresponding to @xmath38 , which reasonably well reproduces the results of the above discussion .",
    "sung ( 2005 , private communication ) reported @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the system . using @xmath41 @xcite , adopting the absolute colors quoted by @xcite and a distance modulus @xmath42 (",
    "* and references therein ) , preliminary computations indicate that the system is too faint to harbour a giant primary , unless its contribution @xmath43 to the observed flux brightness were very close to unity .",
    "this is clearly not confirmed by the previous discussion and we suggest that the primary in could be a class iv object . correcting from the reddening and the distance effects , we obtained @xmath44 and @xmath45 . because the intrinsic colour @xmath46 of an o - type star does almost not depend on the stellar gravity , we note that these values are free from the hypotheses on the luminosity class . according to @xcite",
    ", these values correspond to the primary being a v - iv star and the secondary , a v star . adopting the @xcite temperature scale and bolometric corrections",
    ", we derived @xmath47 ( resp .",
    "@xmath48 ) if the primary is a dwarf ( resp .",
    "giant ) star .",
    "we obtained @xmath49 for the main sequence secondary .",
    "finally , using temperatures of @xmath50  kk ( resp . @xmath51  kk ) , we derived a primary radius of @xmath52  ( resp . @xmath53  ) . for the secondary we interpolated the @xcite temperature scale to obtain values of @xmath54  kk .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath55  , where the quoted confidence intervals have been computed by adopting the parameters of the neighbouring spectral sub - types .",

    "the evolutionary age of both components is about 4 to 5  myr , which is in agreement with previous cluster age determinations from photometric studies @xcite . from a rough interpolation of the tracks ,",
    "the main sequence primary had an initial mass of about 25  , corresponding to a present mass close to 24.5  , slightly larger than typical o9v masses ( which suggests again that the primary component has reached an intermediate stage of evolution between classes v and iii ) .",
    "similarly , the secondary initial mass was about 18.5  .",
    "its present mass should be about 18.2  .",
    "comparing the obtained minimal mass of table [ tab : orbit ] with typical o9v masses suggests an orbital inclination @xmath56 of about 70 . comparing with o9iii masses would rather yield @xmath57 . using the constraints",
    "deduced on the components radii , we found that the limiting inclination for which eclipses may or not occur in the system lies around 55 - 65 . clearly , is a limiting case .",
    "photometric monitoring is required to search for the signature of eclipses or ellipsoidal deformation that could help to constrain the inclination of the system .",

    "these values are in good agreement with previous findings and further indicate that should have an orbital inclination of about 6070 .",
    "this corresponds to a limiting case in which eclipses or ellipsoidal variations might be observed .",
    "we also report the results of the monitoring of the system in the x - rays thanks to  observations of the cluster .",
    "the averaged x - ray spectrum is relatively soft .",
    "it is well reproduced by a 2-t  model with component temperatures about 0.3 and 0.7  kev .",
    "we showed that the system presents an increase of its x - ray flux of about 30% near apastron compared to periastron .",
    "we note that this could be the signature of an ongoing wind - wind interaction process occurring within the wind acceleration region .",
    "such a scenario indeed predicts a stronger shock , and thus a larger x - ray emission from the colliding zone , when the separation between the components is larger , allowing the winds to reach larger pre - shock velocities .",
    "this is also supported by the apparent modulation of the hardness ratio , which seems higher when the emission level is stronger .",
    "preliminary computations however indicate that no simple modeling , reproducing the main properties of the interaction , can be obtained .",
    "by contrast , the same computations rather point towards second order effects , such as radiative inhibition , to play a major role in this system .",
