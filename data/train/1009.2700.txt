    "the study of superconducting and superfluid systems has recently attracted wide attention , among other things because of the realization of ultracold fermi gasses in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "these systems can be considered as quantum simulators that can be used for probing fundamental problems in condensed - matter physics @xcite , for instance the search for exotic new phases in strongly magnetized superconductors .",
    "ultracold fermi gasses offer important advantages over conventional superconductors , mainly because of their extensive tunability . in a superconductor ,",
    "the number of spin - up and spin - down electrons is equal and the interaction strength is fixed . in ultracold fermi gasses , one can not only tune the interaction strength by use of feshbach resonances @xcite , but also the population imbalance can be freely adapted .",
    "this experimental freedom has led to the study of a variety of new phenomena in imbalanced ultracold fermi gasses @xcite .",
    "one fundamental question , that is still not settled , concerns the nature of the ground state of an imbalanced fermi gas .",
    "when population imbalance between the spin - up and spin - down components is introduced into these systems , complete pairing is no longer possible .",
    "clogston and chandrasekhar suggested that above a critical imbalance , the superfluid system would undergo a transition into the normal state @xcite .",
    "this effect has been observed experimentally by the mit @xcite and rice @xcite groups .",
    "however , their observations were not in exact agreement , and there still exists some controversy @xcite about the exact nature of the phases of the superfluid system at high levels of imbalance . in 1964 fulde and ferell @xcite and independently larkin and ovchinnikov @xcite proposed that a superfluid system can accommodate population imbalance , by making a transition into a state with a finite center - of - mass momentum ( and thus a spatially modulated order parameter ) .",
    "this state is the so - called fulde - ferell - larkin - ovchinnikov - state ( fflo - state ) .",
    "recently , there has been an ongoing theoretical search for this exotic state @xcite . in 1d",
    ", the fflo - state was predicted to exist in superconducting systems @xcite .",
    "this work was confirmed numerically @xcite and elaborated further through theoretical studies of the ground state and the phase diagram of a 1d fermi gas @xcite .",
    "furthermore it has been shown that the 1d analogue of the fflo - state is stable in a large section of the bcs - bec crossover phase diagram @xcite , compared to the case of a 3d fermi gas .",
    "although this 1d fflo - state has not yet been observed directly , a recent paper reports the experimental observation of density profiles that agree quantitatively with theoretical predictions at low temperature @xcite . in three dimensions however , the experimental observation of the fflo - state has so far remained elusive .",
    "one of the main reasons for this is that the fflo - state in three dimensions only occurs in a tiny section of the bcs - bec crossover phase diagram @xcite .",
    "this then begs the question , is there a way to stabilize the fflo - state in a 3d fermi gas ?",
    "the purpose of this paper is twofold : first we develop a path - integral description for a superfluid fermi gas which can accommodate the fflo - state , and second we propose a method to stabilize the fflo - state through an optical potential . in two recent papers",
    "it was suggested to stabilize the fflo - state by the use of a 3d optical lattice @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate the stabilizing effect of a 1d optical potential in order to investigate the interplay between the wavevector of the fflo - state and the wavevector of the laser which creates the optical potential . in the present work",
    ", the 1d optical potential provides a periodic modulation in one direction .",
    "we emphasize that we do not look at the fflo - state in a one - dimensional gas @xcite , but in a 3d gas with a superimposed one - dimensional periodic potential . in section [ the free fermi gas ]",
    "we describe the fflo state in an imbalanced fermi gas in 3d within the path - integral framework . as a test for the correctness of this description ,",
    "we calculate the zero temperature phase diagram for this system and compare our findings with recent theoretical results @xcite . in section [ modelling a one - dimensional external potential ]",
    "we investigate two models to account for the effect of a one - dimensional optical potential .",
    "we show that the presence of such a potential leads to a substantial increase of the stability region of the fflo - state .",

    "we describe the 3d imbalanced fermi gas in a 1d optical potential .",
    "there are two main reasons why such a potential can stabilize the fflo - state .",
    "the first reason is that in an imbalanced fermi gas in 3d , the fflo - state can have a wavevector @xmath15 in an arbitrary direction .",
    "this freedom of choice leads to low - energy bosonic excitations , or goldstone modes , which render the fflo - state unstable . in the presence of a 1d optical potential however",

    "this will limit the choice for the wavevector @xmath15 to just one value , thus suppressing the goldstone modes , which is expected to stabilize the fflo - state .",

    "the optical potential is described by using a modified dispersion relation . in section [ anisotropic masses ]",
    "we model the optical potential by introducing an anisotropic effective mass in the direction of the potential @xcite ( from here on this is supposed to be the @xmath50-direction ) .",
    "this approximation is valid when the fermi energy of the system lies near the bottom of the lowest bloch band , i.e. in the case of low density or a short - wavelength optical potential . in section [ bloch - dispersion ] ,",

    "this property relates to experiment , because when an external potential is turned on , the effective mass is altered , but the average density will remain the same .",

    "after rescaling , the phase diagrams for the different effective masses maps onto the phase diagram of the imbalanced fermi gas with isotropic effective mass ( @xmath58 ) , described in section [ the free fermi gas ] . from this",

    "our results coincide with recent theoretical results . as a proposal to stabilize the fflo - state we have studied an imbalanced 3d fermi gas in a 1d optical potential .",
    "this potential was modeled in two different ways .",
    "for the first model , where we considered anisotropic effective masses , we have found that this model is a rescaling of the case of a 3d imbalanced fermi gas with isotropic effective mass . in the second model",
    ", we described the effect of the 1d optical potential using the first bloch band in the tight - binding approximation . in this case",
    "we have found a substantial increase in the stability region of the fflo - state , as compared to the case of the 3d fermi gas without the 1d optical potential .",
    "related results were recently found in the case of a 3d cubic optical lattice @xcite . the advantage of our 1d optical potential scheme , compared to a 3d cubic optical lattice , is that it allows to find an optimal stability configuration for the fflo - state with a given level of imbalance , by tuning the wavelength of the optical potential .",
    "this resonant enhancement of the fflo - region occurs when the wavevector of the fflo - pairs is equal to the wavevector of the optical potential .",
    "this tunability makes a 1d optical potential a suitable experimental configuration for the stabilization of the fflo - state .",
    "we therefore propose that this concept can facilitate the experimental observation of the fflo - state in an imbalanced fermi gas in 3d .",
