    "finite - size scaling ( fss ) has been increasingly important in the study of critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "this is partly due to the progress in the theoretical understanding of finite - size effects , and partly due to the application of fss in the analysis of simulational results .",
    "recently , more attention has been paid to the universality of fss functions @xcite for both percolation models @xcite and ising models @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that several quantities including distribution functions on various lattices have universal fss functions by choosing appropriate metric factors .",
    "it should be noted that universal fss functions depend on boundary conditions and the shape of finite systems .    in the percolation problem , it was considered until a quite recent time that there exists only one percolating cluster on two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattices at the percolating threshold .",
    "but the importance of the number of percolating clusters for anisotropic systems , which was pointed out by hu and lin @xcite , has captured current interest @xcite .",
    "aizenman @xcite derived the upper and lower bounds of the probability for the appearance of @xmath4 percolating clusters , @xmath5 , for 2d percolation at criticality .",
    "his result was later confirmed by monte carlo simulations @xcite . by use of conformal field theory ,",
    "cardy @xcite proposed an exact formula for @xmath5 at the percolation threshold for the systems with large aspect ratios @xcite .",
    "the aspect ratio @xmath6 is an important quantity in the fss functions for anisotropic 2d systems of size @xmath7 .",
    "the `` nonuniversal scaling '' of the low - temperature conductance peak heights for corbino disks in the quantum hall effect has been discussed in terms of the number of the percolating clusters @xcite .    for the ising model , the aspect ratio dependence of binder parameter @xcite at the critical temperature was studied by kamieniarz and blte @xcite .",
    "binder and wang discussed anisotropic fss @xcite .",
    "the aspect ratio dependence of the universal fss functions for binder parameter and magnetization distribution function was discussed by okabe et al .",
    "@xcite for the 2d ising model with tilted boundary conditions . for fixed set of the aspect ratio and the tilt parameter ,",
    "the fss functions were shown to be universal @xcite . quite recently , based on the connection between the ising model and a correlated percolation model , tomita et al .",
    "@xcite studied the fss properties of distribution functions for the fraction of lattice sites in percolating clusters in subgraphs with @xmath4 percolating clusters , @xmath8 , and the distribution function for magnetization in subgraphs with @xmath4 percolating clusters , @xmath9 .",
    "they studied the change of the structure of the magnetization distribution function for the 2d system with large aspect ratio in terms of percolating clusters .",
    "almost all results above for the shape effects on fss functions are for 2d systems except for some works on percolation problem @xcite .",
    "it is quite important to extend these arguments for higher - dimensional systems .",
    "conformal invariance plays a role in 2d systems @xcite , but is not so powerful for three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems as for 2d ones",
    ". moreover , there are two limiting cases for anisotropic 3d systems , that is , the one - dimensional ( 1d ) limit and the 2d limit .",
    "it is interesting to study various types of scaling for anisotropic 3d systems .    in this paper",
    ", we study the fss functions for anisotropic 3d systems by monte carlo simulations .",
    "we are concerned with the ferromagnetic ising model on the @xmath0 simple cubic lattices with the periodic boundary conditions , where @xmath1 is regarded as the anisotropy parameter .",
    "attention is mainly paid to the effect of anisotropy , and we study the @xmath1 dependence of the fss functions for quantities such as the binder parameter and the magnetization distribution function .    at the critical temperature for the 3d ising model , we find that fss functions for the magnetization distribution function change from a two - peak structure to a single - peak one , when the anisotropy parameter @xmath1 is varied from 1 . this behavior is observed both for the systems with 2d anisotropy and for those with 1d anisotropy .",
    "when a system has a large 2d anisotropy , we find that finite - size systems with fixed anisotropy parameter show good fss behavior as 3d systems near the critical temperatures for the layered square - lattice ising models .",
    "in contrast , when we fix a number of layers and apply the fss analysis for layered systems , these systems are scaled as 2d ones .",
    "we organize the rest of the paper as follows . in sec .  2",
    ", we define the fss functions and describe the quantities we treat in this paper . in sec .  3 , we present our simulational results . in sec .  4 ,",
    "our results are summarized and discussed .",
    "if a quality @xmath10 has a singularity of the form @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) near the criticality @xmath13 , then the corresponding quantity @xmath14 for finite systems with the linear size @xmath15 has a following scaling form , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the correlation - length critical exponent and @xmath18 is the scaling function .",
    "of course , the corrections to fss are not negligible for smaller @xmath15 .",
    "the fss is also applicable to the distribution function of @xmath10 . at the criticality @xmath13",
    ", the fss function has a following form , @xmath19    in this paper we focus on the binder parameter and the magnetization distribution function .",
    "the binder parameter @xcite is given by @xmath20 and serves as a measure of the non - gaussian nature of the distribution function .",
    "the fss functions for these quantities are given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the magnetization exponent .",
    "we use the metropolis monte carlo method to simulate the ferromagnetic ising model on @xmath0 simple cubic lattices with different values of @xmath23 and @xmath1 .",
    "we use the periodic boundary conditions .",

    "next turn to the case of @xmath33 , that is , a 1d anisotropic case .",

    "[ g_small](b ) and [ g_large](b ) , and also those of figs .",
    "[ pm_small ] and [ pm_large ] , it seems that there could be a set of the anisotropy parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 which give the same fss functions .",
    "but it needs more careful calculations to clarify this universality .",
    "=    let us consider the origin of the @xmath1 dependence of fss functions .",
    "this problem is related to the multiple percolating clusters .",
    "the connection between critical phenomena of spin models and percolation problems has been studied for a long time @xcite .",
    "quite recently , tomita et al .",
    "@xcite have used the cluster formalism to investigate the percolating properties of the 2d ising model .",
    "they elucidated that the existence of several percolating clusters for anisotropic finite systems leads to the change of the structure of @xmath3 .",
    "that is , the combination of up - spin clusters and down - spin clusters gives the contribution of @xmath36 in @xmath3 for anisotropic case .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath3 for the 3d systems can be understood in the same way as the 2d systems .",
    "we can apply this argument both cases for 2d anisotropy ( @xmath34 ) and 1d anisotropy ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the value of binder parameter @xmath2 at @xmath32 , of course , reflects upon the structure of the distribution function @xmath3 .",
    "=    in order to see the anisotropy parameter dependence more clearly , we plot the @xmath1 dependence of the binder parameter @xmath2 at criticality , @xmath37 , in fig .",

    "this behavior is consistent with above - mentioned multiple - percolating - cluster argument .",
    "such an @xmath1 dependence of @xmath2 at criticality for 1d anisotropy of 2d ising model was already discussed for 2d ising model @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to consider the relation to the layered square - lattice ising model for the case of large 2d anisotropy .",
    "the critical temperatures and the shift exponent for the layered square - lattice ising model were studied by kitatani et al .",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ g_layer ] , we give the temperature dependence of @xmath2 for several lattices , where the number of layers , @xmath41 , is 4 , 6 , and 8 . if we make the system size large with fixing @xmath41 , the system becomes the layered square - lattice ising model .",
    "we can estimate the @xmath41-dependent critical temperature @xmath42 from the crossing point of the curves for fixed @xmath41 in fig .",
    "[ g_layer ] .",
    "our estimates , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , are consistent with those of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "=    =    picking up the data for @xmath46 from fig .",
    "[ g_layer ] , we plot @xmath2 as a function of @xmath47 in fig .",
    "[ g_3d ] . here",
    "we treat @xmath48 for each @xmath41 , and @xmath17 is chosen as 0.625 , that is , the 3d value .",
    "we have good fss behavior in fig .  [ g_3d ] , but this fss plot is different from that given in fig .",

    "@xmath52 is the shift exponent and is shown to be @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "thus , for fixed @xmath1 , we have 3d fss for @xmath48 . in this case , the value of @xmath37 at @xmath54 is @xmath55 , which is nothing but the @xmath37 value for the isotropic 2d ising model .",

    "we have good fss behavior using 3d exponents .",
    "there are two distinct peaks in @xmath3 , which is a typical character of @xmath3 at @xmath27 for the isotropic 2d ising model .",
    "in contrast , if we pick up the data for fixed @xmath41 , for example , @xmath57 , these systems are expected to be scaled by using 2d critical exponents .",
    "since we fix @xmath58 , the scaled variable is given by @xmath59 .",
    "using the 2d exponent , @xmath60 , we get very good scaling plot , shown in fig .",
    "[ g_2d ] . of course , the critical value @xmath37 at @xmath61 is @xmath55 , that is , the @xmath37 value for the isotropic 2d system .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the fss functions for anisotropic 3d ising model by monte carlo simulations .",
    "the anisotropy parameter ( @xmath1 ) dependence of the fss functions for the binder parameter and the magnetization distribution function has been investigated .",
    "we have shown that the magnetization distribution functions change from two - peak structures to single - peak ones as @xmath1 increases or decreases from 1 .",
    "this change of distribution functions may be attributed to the combination of up - spin percolating clusters and down - spin percolating clusters for anisotropic systems , which is the same as the case of 2d systems @xcite .",
    "we should also note that the distribution function @xmath3 approaches the gaussian distribution for large anisotropy , which is another indication of the multiple - percolation - cluster argument .",
    "it is interesting to calculate the probability for the appearance of @xmath4 percolating clusters , @xmath5 , for the anisotropic 3d ising model and to make cluster analysis , which will be left to a future study .",
    "moreover , we have considered the relation to the layered square - lattice ising models for large 2d anisotropy .",
    "we have obtained 3d fss behavior near the critical temperature of the layered square - lattice ising models , @xmath42 , for fixed @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , when we fix the number of layers , we have shown 2d fss behavior near @xmath42 .",
    "thus , we have obtained a unified view of 3d and 2d fss behavior for the anisotropic 3d ising models .",
    "we have studied the shape effects of fss functions for 3d ising models .",
    "fss functions also depend on boundary conditions .",
