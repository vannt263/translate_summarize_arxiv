    "there are many cosmological uses for rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "they provide useful constraints for theories of large - scale structure formation and evolution , and represent valuable ( possibly coeval ) samples of galaxies to study their evolution in dense environments .",
    "studies of @xmath0 , the cluster two - point correlation function , are a powerful probe of large - scale structure , and the scenarios of its formation . until recently",
    ", it has been impractical to obtain large numbers of redshifts for glaxy clusters , forcing cosmologists to deproject their distribution mathematically .",
    "we show that it is feasible to generate a catalog of galaxy clusters at @xmath1 with accurately estimated photometric redshifts .",
    "our data is taken from the digitized second palomar observatory sky survey ( dposs ) .",
    "the digitization , star - galaxy separation , and photometric calibration procedures are described in weir et al .",
    "we have improved star - galaxy classification using a much larger training set .",
    "we use a simple color selection of candidate cluster galaxies , coupled with the adaptive kernel method ( silverman , 1986 ) to generate galaxy surface density maps . a bootstrap technique",
    "is then used to generate the statistical significance map associated with a given surface density map .",
    "this map is then used to detect overdensities of galaxies on the sky which indicate candidate galaxy clusters . in our test fields ,",
    "we recover all of the known abell clusters , and find a large number of new clusters .",
    "because the @xmath2 break is shifting through the blue bandpass of dposs at @xmath3 , the @xmath4 color changes rapidly with redshift . we make the crude assumption that all cluster galaxies are a single  age , early  type population , and use a k  correction model to estimate redshifts from the @xmath4 color alone .",
    "we simply use the mean @xmath4 color of the galaxies in a cluster , after a background correction , to estimate the redshift . in figure",
    "[ fig-1 ] , a @xmath4 vs. @xmath5 diagram for galaxies to @xmath6 in a typical dposs field ( 36 sq . deg . ) is shown .",
    "also shown are the k - correction tracks for scd and e galaxies .",
    "the rapid change in @xmath4 between @xmath7 and @xmath8 for early type galaxies allows us to estimate redshifts for galaxy clusters .          in practice",
    ", the redshift estimation must be done iteratively .",
    "first , we detectcandidate clusters in our galaxy density maps . from those areas in our maps where there are no clusters",
    ", we estimate the background galaxy density and @xmath4 color distribution .",
    "this background correction is then applied to each cluster candidate in a fixed radius , corresponding to an abell radius at @xmath9 , the expected median redshift of our clusters .",
    "the redshift of each cluster is then estimated from the mean @xmath4 color of the galaxies inside this radius . using this redshift estimate",
    ", we recalculate @xmath10 , and estimate the redshift using the mean color in this radius .",
    "this procedure is repeated until the estimated redshift converges .    in figure",
    "[ fig-2 ] , we show the mean @xmath4 color for galaxies in 36 abell clusters with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the line shown is a theoretical k ",
    "correction track for e  type galaxies .",
    "it is not a fit to the data .",
    "the mean deviation of the data from the theoretical curve is @xmath11 .",
    "this suggests that we can estimate redshifts for our candidate clusters in an accurate , unbiased way , directly from calibrated plate photometry .",
    "this result relies on the large number of same age and type galaxies in clusters at low redshift . as the cluster galaxy population changes with redshift",
    ", this technique will eventually fail . for @xmath12 ,",
    "the @xmath5 color could be used ; unfortunately , our @xmath13 plate data are not deep enough for this purpose .",
    "we have obtained deeper ccd imaging of our low@xmath14 candidates , where we will attempt to detect and estimate redshifts for more distant clusters .",
