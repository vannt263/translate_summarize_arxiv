    "information inequalities are one of the central tools of information theory .",
    "an information inequality is a relation between information measures such as entropy and mutual information that holds regardless of the specific choice of joint probability distribution on the underlying random variables , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapters 1214 ) .",
    "converse proofs involving chains of information inequalities are ubiquitous in the literature , extending back to shannon .",
    "it is somewhat frustrating therefore , that a characterization of the complete set of information inequalities is lacking . until the appearance of the zhang - yeung inequality  @xcite ,",
    "the only known inequalities were the so - called shannon , or basic inequalities , being consequences of the non - negativity of conditional mutual information ( which is a special case of non - negativity of information divergence ) .",
    "starting with @xcite , large classes of conditional non - shannon inequalities ( e.g. contingent on imposition of certain markov constraints ) have been found  @xcite .",
    "a countably infinite class of unconstrained inequalities was reported in @xcite , indexed by the number of random variables @xmath2 involved ( one inequality for each @xmath2 ) .",
    "more recently , additional unconstrained non - shannon inequalities have been found  @xcite .",
    "another countably infinite class of unconditional inequalities was recently found in @xcite .",
    "this class differs from @xcite , in that a countably infinite number of inequalities were found for any fixed number of @xmath4 random variables .",
    "as we shall see later , this result has profound implications .",
    "an intimately related concept is the set of entropy functions @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath5 $ ] be a subset of a @xmath6 dimensional euclidean space .",
    "each coordinate of this space will be indexed by a subset of a set @xmath7 with @xmath2 elements .",
    "points @xmath8 $ ] can be regarded as functions , mapping from the set of all subsets of @xmath7 onto @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "points in @xmath5 $ ] belong to @xmath0 if they correspond to a consistent choice of joint entropies for a set @xmath11 of @xmath2 random variables .",
    "members of @xmath0 are called _ entropic _ , and members of the closure of @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath12 , are called _",
    "almost entropic_.    characterization of @xmath12 is equivalent to determination of the set of all possible information inequalities  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 12.3 ) .",
    "this characterization is lacking for @xmath13 .",
    "in contrast , we do know the set @xmath14 corresponding to the basic inequalities .",
    "this set contains some functions that obey the basic inequalities , but are not entropy functions and do not correspond to any joint distribution on @xmath2 random variables .",
    "the basic inequalities are equivalent to the polymatroid axioms , and hence @xmath15 is simply the set of polymatroids , implying a polyhedral structure .",
    "characterization of @xmath0 is an important open problem .",
    "it gives bounds for source coding problems @xcite .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , it would resolve the implication problem of conditional independence ( determination of all additional conditional independence relations implied by a given set of conditional independence relationships ) .",
    "in other fields , information inequalities are also closely linked to group theory  @xcite and the theory of kolmogorov complexity  @xcite .",
    "the focus in this paper is however on the link between entropy functions and the capacity region of multi - source network coding .",
    "the prevailing approach to data transport in communications networks is based on routing , in which intermediate nodes duplicate and forward packets towards their final destination .",
    "although such a store - and - forward scheme is simple to implement , it does not guarantee efficient utilization of available transmission capacity . the network coding approach introduced in  @xcite generalizes routing by allowing intermediate nodes to forward packets that are coded combinations of all received data packets .",
    "this seemingly simple change in approach yields many benefits .",
    "not only can network coding increase throughput in multicast scenarios , it can also provide robustness to link failure @xcite , wiretap security  @xcite , and minimal transmission cost  @xcite .",
    "naturally , these advantages are obtained at the expense of increased node complexity .",
    "one fundamental problem in network coding is to understand the capacity region and the classes of codes that achieve capacity . in the single session multicast scenario ,",
    "the problem is well understood .",
    "in particular , the capacity region is characterized by max - flow / min - cut bounds and linear network codes are sufficient to achieve maximal throughput @xcite .",
    "significant practical and theoretical complications arise in more general multicast scenarios , involving more than one session .",
    "it was recently proved that linear network codes are not sufficient for the multi - source problem  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the network coding capacity region is unknown .",
    "in fact , there are only a few tools in the literature for study the capacity region .    one powerful theoretical tool bounds the capacity region by the intersection of a set of hyperplanes ( specified by the network topology and connection requirement ) and the set of entropy functions @xmath0 ( inner bound ) , or its closure @xmath12 ( outer bound )  @xcite .",
    "recently , these bounds have been tightened to obtain an exact expression for the capacity region , again in terms of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the capacity region , or even the bounds can not be computed in practice , due to the lack of an explicit characterization of the set of entropy functions for more than three random variables .",
    "one way to resolve this difficulty is via relaxation of the bound , replacing the set of entropy functions with the set of polymatroids @xmath15 .",
    "the resulting `` linear programming '' bound can be quite loose .",
    "recent work  @xcite based on matroid theory showed that application of the zhang - yeung inequality  @xcite yields a tighter bound for the capacity region ( by obtaining a better outer bound for the set of entropy functions ) .",
    "the main results of this paper are new dualities between non - negative functions @xmath16 $ ] and network codes .",
    "these duality results are based on the construction of a special network multicast problem from functions @xmath3 .",
    "the underlying network topology is fixed and the multicast problem depends on @xmath3 only through the assignment of link capacities and source rates .",
    "three main kinds of duality are considered , corresponding to different restrictions on @xmath3 and different kinds of network codes .",
    "first , we show in theorem  [ thm : firstduality ] that the constructed multicast problem is solvable ( i.e. the constructed source rates and link capacities are in the capacity region ) if and only if @xmath3 is the entropy function of a set of quasi - uniform random variables .",
    "this duality is extended in theorem   [ thm : firstdualityextension ] to show that the multicast problem is asymptotically solvable with @xmath17 error if and only if @xmath18 is almost entropic .",
    "the second duality restricts attention to linear network codes .",
    "we show that the multicast problem is linearly solvable if and only if @xmath3 is linear group characterizable ( i.e. @xmath3 is an entropy function for random variables generated by vector spaces ) . a corresponding limiting form of this duality is also provided .",
    "finally , by relaxing the requirement that the domain of @xmath3 be subsets of random variables , we obtain a duality between polymatroids and the linear programming bound .",
    "these duality results yield several immediate implications .",
    "in particular , we provide an alternative proof to @xcite for the insufficiency of linear ( and abelian ) network codes , and demonstrate the utility of non - shannon inequalities to tighten outer bounds on network coding capacity regions .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "section [ sec : networks ] introduces some fundamentals of network coding .",
    "section [ sec : algebraic ] focuses on network codes with algebraic structure , and random variables generated by groups with a variety of algebraic structures . we establish a relation between linear network codes and random variables generated by vector spaces and generalize this idea to define the concept of a group network code .",
    "a central theme of the paper is the trade - off between source rate and link capacity using network coding , i.e. determination of the network coding capacity region .",
    "section [ sec : tradeoff ] introduces the definitions for admissibility and achievability in the network coding context .",
    "section [ sec : bounds ] introduces the concept of pseudo - variables , which generalize random variables in such a way that allows a notational unification of the linear programming bound with that of  @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : result ] proves the duality results , theorems [ thm : firstduality ]  [ thm : lpbd ] .",
    "these results rely on the construction in section [ sec : construction ] of a special network and multicast problem from a function @xmath3 .",
    "section  [ sec : firstduality ] gives the duality between entropic functions and solvable multicast problems .",
    "section [ sec : secondduality ] provides the corresponding duality for linearly solvable multicast problems .",
    "these duality results are extended in section [ sec : thirdduality ] to give a similar link between polymatroids and the linear programming bound , i.e. a function @xmath3 is a polymatroid if and only if the constructed source rates and link capacities satisfy the bound .",
    "this result relies heavily on the notion of pseudo - variables introduced in section [ sec : bounds ] , and in particular on extension and adhesion of sets of pseudo - variables , discussed in appendix [ app : lpbd ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : fourthduality ] we give a one - way relation between the lp bound for linear codes , and polymatroids which also satisfy the ingleton inequality .    section [ sec : applicationa ] explores the implications of our results , which include the insufficiency of linear or even ( abelian ) group network codes , and the necessity for non - shannon inequalities for determination of the network coding capacity region .    _",

    "so far we have only specified the basic network topology .",

    "@xmath46 is a receiver - location mapping , where @xmath47 is the set of nodes requiring the data of session @xmath45 .",
    "it should be noted that there is _ no specified rate requirement_. the connection requirement differs from the usual concept of multicast requirement in that it only specifies _ which _ nodes require data from which other nodes , and not any particular desired information rate .    given a connection requirement @xmath48 ,",

    "data transmission takes place as follows .",

    "zero - error _ network code is one for which @xmath69 , implying that the source symbols @xmath58 are deterministic functions of the corresponding receiver - incident edge symbols .",

    "as will be stated in proposition  [ prop : linearcodeandlinearchar ] , the set of all the kernels of these linear functions associated with all the links can be used to `` construct '' the set of source and link random variables defining the network code . to understand this relationship , we first review the construction of random variables from a finite group and its groups  @xcite .",

    "the network topology depends only on the number of random variables , and not on the function @xmath3 , which affects the construction only through the assignment of source rates and link capacities .",
    "an extension of this result shows that a rate - capacity tuple for the constructed multicast problem is achievable by linear network codes if and only if the entropy function @xmath3 is almost linear group characterizable .",
    "a further extension shows that the induced rate - capacity tuple satisfies the linear programming bound if and only if the function @xmath3 is a polymatroid ( i.e. satisfies all shannon - type inequalities ) .",
    "this extension is obtained using the concept of pseudo - variables , which replace random variables in the domain of @xmath3 .",
    "these pseudo - variables are abstract objects that do not take any values , and are not associated with any probability distribution .",
    "the key is that polymatroids defined over set of pseudo - variables behave very similar to entropy functions , except that they lie in @xmath15 rather than @xmath0 .",
    "this definition of pseudo - variables is not just a matter of terminology .",
    "it is a non - trivial matter to generalize notions of extension and adhesion of random variables ( which rely on the existence of a probability distribution ) to pseudo - variables .",
    "we provided some examples of such extensions and adhesions , which leaves the proof of the main theorem intact under a substitution of pseudo - variables for random variables .",
    "we anticipate that this concept of pseudo - variables , and their differences from random variables , may yet bear more fruit in uncovering the structure of @xmath0    the seemingly simple duality between entropy vectors and network codes has a number of powerful implications .",
    "it renders the problems of network code solubility is at least as hard as determination of @xmath12 .",
    "we also obtain alternate proofs that the lp bound is not tight , and that non - shannon inequalities such as the zhang - yeung inequality indeed tighten the lp bound .",
    "however no additional finite number of inequalities can improve the lp bound to the capacity region .",
    "finally , we have proved the suboptimality of abelian network codes , including linear codes , @xmath149-module codes and any scheme that time - shares between such codes .",
    "the duality result also provides a tool to compare different classes of network codes . rather than comparing the codes directly",
    ", one can now compare the sets of entropy functions induced by the codes .",

    "before we prove the direct part of theorem [ thm : lpbd ] , we will prove some intermediate results which show how to _ extend _ sets of pseudo - variables ( build new pseudo - variables from old ones ) , and how to _ adhere _ additional pseudo - variables to a given set of pseudo - variables ( consistently join two sets of pseudo - variables ) .",
    "these results are provided in section [ sec : adherence ] .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : lpbd ] follows in section [ sec : prooflpbd ] .      for random variables , adhesion or extension",
    "is facilitated by the existence of an underlying probability distribution .",
    "for example , consider two sets of random variables @xmath473 and @xmath474 with respective underlying distributions @xmath475 and @xmath476 .",
    "suppose that the marginals over @xmath477 coincide , @xmath478 . we can then easily adhere @xmath475 and @xmath476 to obtain a new distribution @xmath479 such that its marginals over @xmath7 and @xmath480 coincide , @xmath481 and @xmath482 .",
    "one possibility is @xmath483 . in general , for any sets of random variables @xmath484 and @xmath480 with respective distributions @xmath485 and @xmath486 coinciding on @xmath487 , we can construct a new distribution over @xmath488 such that its marginals over @xmath7 and @xmath480 are @xmath485 and @xmath486 .",
    "clearly , the entropy function for @xmath488 is an extension of those belonging to @xmath7 and @xmath489 .",
    "consider another simple example .",
    "let @xmath490 be a subset of the random variables @xmath7 .",
    "then we can define a new random variable @xmath491 . by doing so ,",
    "we have constructed a new variable , and extended both the distribution and entropy function .",
    "clearly there are various ways to adhere or extend sets of random variables .",
    "doing this for pseudo - variables is not so straightforward .",

    "lemma [ lem : sumextension ] shows that for any independent pseudo - variables @xmath477 and @xmath492 of equal pseudo - entropies , one can construct a pseudo - variable @xmath503 , denoted @xmath508 such that its pseudo - entropy is the same as @xmath477 and @xmath492 , and any single pseudo - variable is a function of the two others .",
