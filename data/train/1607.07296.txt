    "<S> we investigate the matter density perturbation @xmath0 and power spectrum @xmath1 in the running vacuum model ( rvm ) with the cosmological constant being a function of the hubble parameter , given by @xmath2 . taking the dark energy perturbation into consideration , we derive the evolution equation for @xmath0 and find a specific scale @xmath3 , which divides the evolution of the universe into the sub and super - interaction regimes , corresponding to @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively . for the former </S>",
    "<S> , the evolution of @xmath0 has the same behavior as that in the @xmath6cdm model , while for the latter , the growth of @xmath0 is frozen ( greatly enhanced ) when @xmath7 due to the couplings between radiation , matter and dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the observational data rule out the cases with @xmath8 and @xmath9 , while the allowed window for the model parameters is extremely narrow with @xmath10 .    </S>",
